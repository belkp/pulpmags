preface

in presenting this the first amazing stories quarterly to you we take it or granted that you are already
a regular reader of amazing stories monthly in the two years during which amazing stories has been
published thousands of readers have voiced the opinion that they would like to see it come out more fre-
quently many readers wanted to see it a semi-monthly and some even wanted it each week these two
suggestions for production and publishing reasons however we have found to be an impractical solution to
the problem

    last summer we issued the amazing stories annual in which was featured the master mind of mars
by edgar rice burroughs this c annual enjoyed an excellent reception and brought forth many letters
from readers who enjoyed the book asking us to publish such a book more frequently

    the result is amazing stories quarterly the first issue of which you now have before you

    the publication dates of amazing stories quarterly will be as follows

           winter issuejanuary th

              spring issue -----	april th

          summer issuejuly th

fall issueoctober th

    the publication of the quarterly will not interfere with amazing stories monthly magazine because the
monthly is on the newsstands about the th of the month it is believed that this staggering of the publica-
tion date will make the financial burden less heavy on amazing stories readers

    the quarterly performs one important duty it enables us to publish many full length novels which we
know you want and which if they were printed in the monthly would take a good deal of time to publish it
has been the rule of amazing stories monthly to publish a full-size novel in three installments that means
it takes three months before it is completed we have so many excellent full-length novels on hand which we
wish to give our readers that we feel the quarterly supplementing the monthly will furnish an ideal arrange-
ment

    since the inception of amazing stories a new literature which we term scientifiction has sprung up and
there are so many excellent short stories as well as full-length novels that are at our disposition now that in
the very nature of things it would take too long if all of them were to be published in the monthly

    it will furthermore be seen that the quarterly contains exactly twice as much material as the monthly
and for that reason we come pretty close to the wish of so many of our readers-namely to come out twice a
month as far as material and stories are concerned the quarterly practically accomplishes this

    heeding the request of a large number of our readers we have not included in this quarterly any stories
that appeared in the regular monthly publication all the stories in the quarterly are brand new with the
exception of when the sleeper wakes by h g wells and the gravity king by clelland j ball

    we have had a great many requests to publish when the sleeper wakes and since it is one of the fore-
most books ever written by ii g wells we are convinced that you will welcome its publication-especially
because the book is out of print and is therefore very difficult to get at the present time

    but the big story of the season is undoubtedly the moon of doom a new full-length novel published here
for the first time this is a story that will arouse your interest and we know your approval it is one of the
most exciting scientifiction stories we have printed in a year and it ranks well with the best of such stories
anywhere

    now after you have read the first issue of the quarterly we would very much like to have your reaction
to this publication you will find a voting blank elsewhere in this magazine which we would ask you to be
good enough to fill out	editor

it is the very error of the moon

which comes more near the earth than she was wont
and makes men mad-othello

chapter i
a slip in cosmos

arth faced chaos-something was wrong
with time

  for half a week the days had been getting
shorter about a quarter of an hour had been
clipped from the twenty-four hours of the day

  science confused could give no satisfactory explana-
tion it was known that the earth was speeding up on
its axis this alone was certain as to the cause a
thousand and one theories had been projected from as
many sources observatories the world over were
broadcasting reports so garbled that none could under-
stand and it wasnt the fault of the wireless for static
had been eliminated many years ago astronomy in
particular was befogged the world was speeding up
on its axis this epitomized the myriad suppositions so
far as the man on the street could comprehend what
would happen if the acceleration continued chaos
was the answer here science had no doubt would it
continue science could not say we must first de-
termine the causc of the phenomenon was the some-
what vacuous observation of professor josephus sayre
of the yerkes observatory recognized as the greatest
astronomer of the age and to whom the world was
looking for an answer and the renowned professor
was in a berserker rage because of his impotence in
the premises science itself was mad

  other than the shortening of the days little change
had been noted the east still held the suns wakening
and the west its repose though there was a fraction less
of both daylight and darkness the stars had lost none
of their glory and each maintained its niche when
the change was first
noticed astronomers had
turned their telescopes on
the moon which had been
acting strangely for
years but the satellite
still hung high in the
heavens apparently fol-
lowing on its usual orbit
though its motion like
that of every other object
in the skies seemed ac-
celerated as a result of
the earths new speed it
was announced from the
berlin observatory how-
ever that luna was shin-
ing with unwonted bril-
liance the bolometer
showed that she was re-
flecting a little more than
the usual one-th
part of the suns midday

light but it was agreed that this probably was due to
the fact that the atmosphere was at last practically free
of smoke

  on the first morning of the change when it was an-
nounced that the sun had risen nearly three minutes
late an incredulous world was inclined to laugh-and
did laugh when it learned that the news came from the
burke station in colorado for it was none other than
the eccentric professor francis burke astronomer
hieroglyphist and orator who had predicted that the tail
of the great comet of  would annihilate all life on
the globe and the world laughed louder when it re-
membered that the day was april first capital it

jv

exclaimed professor burkes revenge the aristo-
phanic astronomer jibed an editorial in the new york
banner the hoax of the century screamed the lon-
don enquirer while the sensational chicago dailytab
issued an extra heralding slip in solar system in
red type the sedate washington sentinel declared edi-
torially that the publicity-seeking perpetrator of this
hoax who again bids fair to needlessly alarm the world
should be dealt with summarily in a manner fitting the
enormity of the intended jest even though it is all
fools day

  so the world the work-a-day world the joke-loving
world had its little laugh and went about its affairs
as usual professor burke simply had overslept or his
watch was wrong

  but later in the morning when radio advices from
new york paris berlin and other centers of astronomic
learning corroborated the intelligence from the burke
station the world woke

  the world woke but was still skeptical the sun
missing schedule impossible absurd had all the
scientists joined in burkes jest

  and then the climax professor josephus sayre him-
self announced that the yerkes instruments established
the suns delinquency beyond cavil

  it was then that consternation gripped civilization
and on the night of april first when professor sayre
was the earliest to announce that the sun had gone
down nearly three minutes ahead of schedule stark
terror began to stalk the earth

  stark terror and bedlam science helpless groping
all races united by the bond of common fear forgetting
everything except the great change and asking but one
question is this the end the ferment called hu-
manity more restless than ever new york washington
london paris and berlin broadcasting nothing but the
latest observatory dispatches newspapers printing
sun news only a world interested in nothing else

commerce at a standstill
thousands of telescopes
of every magnitude
searching the heavens
awe-stricken millions for-
getting how to laugh
hedonism relegated re-
vival of religon theology
as impotent as science to
answer the great query
is this the end

  and then on the eve-
ning of the fourth day
when a few seconds more
than eighteen minutes
had been snatched from
the quotidian measure by
the unknown hand that
mocked the immutability
of the universe came the
discovery that staggered
the trembling world

  the cause was found by
professor ernest sherard brilliant young lunarian of
mount shasta observatory whose recent discovery of
hieroglyphics on the side of mount hadley on the moon
had been hailed as the astronomic triumph of the century

  professor sherard declared that the moon was re-
turning to the earth

  trigonometrical calculations by other noted astrono-
mers including professor sayre were made at once and
verified sherards assertion

  it was then that the worlds intellect began to totter

  unreasoning in their madness the masses fumed at
a science that predicted but could not prevent in the
vague hope that something might be done to stop the

 e have no hesitancy in declaring that you
 will read this tremendous story with bated
 breath throughout here is an interplane-
 tary story that is totally different-one of
 the best stories of the kind you have ever
 read we admit that we ourselves could
 not lay the story aside until we finished it
 in the wee hours of the morning the sci-
 ence throughout the story is excellent and
 in keeping with present-day scientific knowl-
 edge but it is not the science alone that
 makes this one of the greatest stories of the

satellite they waited impatiently for further word from
mount shasta where ernest sherard a man still in
his early thirties-a man whose strong face framed a
dreamers eyes-kept feverish vigil at his telescope

chapter ii
the twenty-first century

hat the world was pleased to call the true dawn
of civilization had come in the year 

  while no catholicon for the worlds ills had
een found many had been erased there had been no
wars for half a century though commercialism still
held sway and avarice was not extinct men as a whole
were devoting more time to art and science the burden
of industry having been lightened greatly by discoveries
that had existed only as far-fetched dreams a few dec-
ades before though the greatest progress had been
made in inventions the science of medicine-surgery
in particular-also had made enormous strides there
had been a true renaissance of learning and knowledge
was the golden fleece the work of harnessing the
elements had been completed there were few dark
corners left on the globe man was pushing ever onward
his face toward the light he was learning at last how
to face life and there was no such thing as too much
love of living suicide was almost a thing of the past
prisons were few and all but empty there was work-
for all but not too much of it the dawn of the golden
age was in the air

  the greatest achievement of the century was the re-
lease and control of atomic energy which was now doing
the worlds work the secret had been learned in the
murden laboratories in  except for lighting and
minor power purposes electricity had been shelved in
limbo steam power was only a memory giant bird-
like atoplanes made of duralumin filled the air carry-
ing on much of the worlds travel and commerce ato-
mobiles both ponderous and small constituted the traffic
problem in the cities colossal atomotors turned the
wheels of industry it was the age of the atom

   the atoplanes were capable of indefinite flight and the
swiftest of them could go two thousand miles an hour
gargantuan atoliners made daily roundtrips from both
europe and america ships had practically vanished
trom the seas and railroads from the land atomobiles
speeding along hard-surfaced roads that radiated every-
where transported passengers and some of the lighter
freight most of the passenger travel however was in
small privately owned atoplanes which had a speed of
about five hundred miles an hour every city had its
atofield and many of the older houses and nearly all
of the office and industrial buildings had been covered
with flat-topped structures affording landing stages
while all of the new buildings were being constructed
on this plan elevators opening on the roofs provided
descent into the structures equipped with super-heli-
copters the machines needed only their own displace-
ment in which to land or rise atoheat supplied warmth
in all buildings while all but the smaller dwellings used
atolight for illumination

  atoplanes had carried man to every part of the
planet excursions in capsule-shaped atoliners to the
poles were common explorers had made many remark-
able discoveries chief among which was the finding of a
temperate valley between epic mountains and glaciers
two hundred miles from the north pole which amund-
sen on his flight across the pole to alaska in  had
barely missed this valley earths newest frontier had
become peopled by the adventurous from all climes it
was named rogeriand for its discoverer an american
and its chief city was boreas fifty miles long and
nearly as wide the fertile rift now had a population of

nearly half a million many strange flora and fauna
had been found there

  the principal metamorphosis caused by the develop-
ment of the atoplane had to do with the redistribution
of population in nearly all countries the population
of the large cities had decreased in keeping with the
growth of suburban life while new communities had
sprung up like mushrooms especially on the sides of
mountains the residents flying to and from the cities
which were still the centers of industry education sci-
ence art and amusement

  another and probably the most important effect of
the utilization of atomic energy was the definite out-
lawing of war with universal energy at their disposal
the nations realized that war would mean universal
suicide twenty years since the principal governments
had adopted the perpetual peace pact for mutual pro-
tection all armies and navies had been abolished and
fighting machinery scrapped only a few relics having
been saved for museums with the fear of war elimi-
nated the world had turned its energy toward building
a real civilization and utopia seemed just around the
corner nearly every country was a republic even
great britain had given up her king

  the worlds news was disseminated almost entirely
by radio with static eliminated nearly every home had
both receiving and sending sets telephone and tele-
graph had disappeared newspapers were published
only in the large cities and their news contents were
confined mainly to major items which in the old days
were called bulletins their make-up was given over
largely to editorials and articles written by leading edu-
cators scientists and fictionists and to advertisements
through a recent invention by which radiograms were
typed directly on the cylinders of the presses almost im-
mediate dissemination of the news was effected

  astronomy was perhaps the most popular science re-
flectors with -inch specula had been perfected bring-
ing thousands of new stars to view every great obser-
vatory was a mecca for a star-gazing populace the
rudiments of astronomy were taught even in the primary
schools and youth was exhibiting keen interest in it
just as the younger generation of three-quarters of a
century before had been the most rabid radio devotees

  the powerful reflectors had brought much new plane-
tary knowledge it was known that the markings on
mars really were cleverly engineered canals as sug-
gested by professor percival lowell many years before
but that life on the arid globe had been extinct prob-
ably  years that venus turned on its axis and
that conditions there were favorable to life in many
forms was also revealed the theory that saturns
mighty rings were composed of huge encircling meteor-
ites some nearly as large as planetoids had also been
proved a tenth moon had been found in attendance
on the giant jupiter another discovery was that the
midget mercury turned both faces to the sun the most
distant planets uranus and neptune were shown to be
worlds of ice whereas it had been believed they were
spheres of fire

  but the discovery that occasioned most interest was
that made by professor sherard whose invention a
telescopic attachment that concentrated the magnitude
of the reflectors permitting a much more minute study
of a small area had disclosed strange writings on mount
hadley one of the moons largest mountains bizarre
figures some a hundred feet high and weird lettering
that no one had been able to decipher were now visible
it vas also thought that mathematical calculations had
been carved on the almost perpendicular cliff but the
sherard concentrator was not powerful enough to make
this clear

  that the chiseling was the work of a vanished race
astronomy was certain the most powerful telescopes
the moon of doom



brought the satellite within ten miles as it were and
its surface was shown to be a fantastic stretch of moun-
tains craters and plains with an absolute absence of air
and water the origin of the craters was still a mystery
as was the nature of the strange white rays which
radiated from a few of the principal craters

  the advance of medical science in the year  had
failed to reach a fountain of youth but had conquered
nearly every disease the span of human life had been
lengthened many years and there were thousands of
centenarians men were at last learning how to delay
death by correct living the great white plague was
only a memory cancer had been the last terror to be
vanquished prodigious progress had been made in sur-
gery no longer were the maimed and the blind seen
on the streets new limbs were grafted on the dis-
membei-ed the eyes of the newly dead were made to
function in the sockets of the sightless and nearly every
other lost or worn out part of the body heart and brain
excepted was similarly replaced

  poverty the mocker of civilization had vanished the
conflict of labor and capital was no more criminals
were treated for their sick minds and capital punishment
had been outlawed everywhere depravity was regarded
as insanity the law of cause and effect was universally
recognized

  mankind was growing up

chapter iii

the revenge of the atom

professor sherard in his theory as to the
cause of the great change which was broadcast
everywhere and published in full in every paper
blamed the release of atomic energy

  atoms he explained were the source of the earths
magnetism as well as its energy the wholesale use of
the new power through the blasting of the atom had
disrupted the finely wrought balance between the earth
and the moon the residue of released energy instead
of returning to its natural state or assuming another
form had gradually enveloped the planet with an in-
visible but powerful magnetic jacket several miles thick
he cited the enormous increase in the number of meteor-
ites that had entered the earths atmosphere in recent
years as substantiation of his theory this new mag-
netism distinct from the earths gravitational force
had at last overcome the planets tidal reaction on the
moon which had been driving the satellite farther into
space since the time it became liberated from the nascent
earth and was pulling it back causing the earth to
rotate faster each mile the moon advanced

  the only hope he said was that the immediate cessa-
tion of atomic energy production might halt the moon
and gradually restore the balance

   but i see little hope even if this is done he declared
dismally the pull of the earth has already counter-
acted the push of the tides and it is probable that nothing
we can do will repair the break it seems that the
moon must continue its earthward course until the finish
it is barely possible however that the tides themselves
may eventually drive it back or that science will find
some way to neutralize or vitiate the atomic envelope
in the latter case the moon would halt and gradually
recede again due to the tidal reaction but such a
possibility seems very remote the new magnetism is
the ghost of the atom as it were and is earthbound
surrounding the globe like a spectral sheet that cannot
be unwound extensive research in my laboratory has
failed to reveal a way by which its influence can be coun-
teracted all we can do is to return to the use of elec-
tricity or some other non-magnetizing agent the pro-
duction of atomic energy should be stopped summarily

the world over and if that fails to undo the great
change the earth must pass

  the moon is now advancing at a rate of about a thou-
sand miles a day it is now about  miles away
if its present speed is maintained it will be of course
two hundred and thirty-five days before it reaches the
earth but its speed will undoubtedly increase each
mile just as a needle moves faster as it nears a magnet
it is known that a needle fairly jumps to the magnet
when a certain point of attraction is reached and it
is possible that the moon will do likewise when it at-
tains a certain proximity to the earth

  science now knows that the moon was once a part
of the earth and that it was cast off as from a break-
ing flywheel when the molten planet was rotating at an
inconceivable speed and then after the earth broke
under the centrifugal strain and the moon became a
separate body there was a time when the two spinning
spheres almost grazed at this time the earth was re-
volving in about three hours and the moon shared its
rotation but the reaction of the tides-and they must
have been immense-caused the moon to recede farther
and farther and the earth to slow down correspondingly
the days becoming longer

  when the earth and the moon were virtually in
contact the day was about three hours long up to the
time of the great change the moons average distance
was about  miles and the day twenty-four hours
long taking the average distance as a working basis
this shows that for every  - miles the moon
receded the day became an hour longer it is logical
to presume that the situation will be reversed as the
moon advances-that one hour will be clipped from the
twenty-four for every  - miles until when the
moon has come twenty-one times this distance it will
very nearly if not actually touch the earth which will
be rotating in about three hours the satellite moving
with it but there is a possibility as previously ex-
plained that the moon will do more than merely graze
the earth the planets new magnetism may cause the
smaller sphere to literally shoot earthward when a crit-
ical nearness is attained this will certainly occur if the
moon does not stop before it comes within twenty thou-
sand miles

  but long before that dread collision takes place it
is probable that life on the earth will be extinct the
tides must be reckoned with even should the globes
mad whirl fail to destroy all living things by the
time the moon has covered two-thirds of the distance a
new glacial age will have begun and it is likely that
the satellites gravitational force what with the greatly
increased rotation of the earth will have caused the
freezing seas to leave their beds and cover all the world
except the higher mountains and some of the higher
plateaus

  will the world fly to pieces during its travail i
think not its crust is solid for many miles and though
its surface may shift i believe the globe as a whole will
remain intact however the sphere will groan in its
agony and in its weaker spots its crust will be split and
twisted by earthquakes of inconceivable severity its
topography will be made over almost completely by the
churning waters and it will become a domain of ice
even should the threatened collision occur the globes
warmth will decreaseas its velocity increases due to
the shortening of its exposures

  the end of the world is inevitable unless science
finds some way to banish the new magnetism or some
new phenomenon arises to combat its influence be-
fore another day passes every producer of atomic energy
should be stopped even to every atoplane and atomobile
every scientist should devote his entire time and energy
toward the possible discovery of something that may
avert the impending doom

 ly all of the leading astronomers every atomic

engine in christendom came to a sudden stop mandates
having been issued almost simultaneously by every gov-
ernment every atoplane and atomobile was parked
industry and commerce were paralyzed the world was
stunned silent like a child stricken speechless with
fright gone was its gaiety its pomposity its cupidity
the moon of doom



aware of the true import of the great change its tot-
tering reason was temporarily restored men talked in
hushed whispers and of one thing only the world was
coming to an end

  the quest for fame the race for fortune-what mat-
tered they now and science had said that the world
was in its youth how helpless was science how im-
potent everything yet many believed that in some
laboratory perhaps in some obscure research corner
would be discovered the secret that would restore the
cosmic balance the heavens themselves held the threat
of doom yet some found solace in religion many here
and there went about their work as usual like tolstoys
plowman the great ferment was oozing down at last
and men were becoming sober as the bubbles burst

  and in their soberness in the face of universal dis-
aster they were united as never before hope had not
vanished utterly-it would live as long as there was one
man left to tread the globe there still was work for
the world to do so men found time to forget some of their
fears in the great sedative called labor

  every industrial plant in the world was turned im-
mediately into a beehive of activity where men worked
day and night converting their discarded atomotors and
other atomic engines into electrically propelled machin-
ery that would carry on the worlds work until the end
commerce was still necessary the distribution of
food was a more vital problem than ever

  so within a fortnight the wheels of industry were
whirlii again turned by a force which men had almost
forgotten how to use electric vehicles of every descrip-
tion many of them hastily improvised were pressed into
service everywhere while airplanes of a type of fifty
years before flecked the skies most of these planes
were not suited for inter-continental flight however
and many electrically driven ships were built an even
more ancient power steam was used in some of the
maritime craft

  it was realized that these makeshift arrangements
could not keep unclogged the arteries of commerce but
with trade restricted to the barest essentials and travel
virtually eliminated they would suffice for the present

  science too had regained its composure every
laboratory every observatory was the scene of sedulous
investigation the magnetic jacket was being studied
from every angle in the hope of finding a counter attrac-
tion a de-magnetizing power that would snap the pull
of doom every reflector and refractor was employed
from dawn to dusk with the ghastly mocking moon the
cynosure of each lens

  among the most persevering workers were professors
sherard and burke the latter astronomer who had
sprung into worldwide prominence through his discov-
ery of the great change having joined the young wizard
of mount shasta in his efforts to find a planet-saving
clue

  in the little more than two weeks that had elapsed
since the change began the moon had advanced nearly
eighteen thousand miles during the last week a de-
cided gain in its speed had been noted the satellites
orbit was narrowing every day the earth was revolving
a bit faster with each shortening of the course-and the
day had dwindled to twenty-two hours and forty-three
minutes

  to the naked eye the moon appeared but a trifle
larger though its markings were a little more distinct
and its reflected light a vestige brighter a seeming
paradox was that its resemblance to a human face was
becoming less distinguishable as its etchings emerged
clearer the principal changes noted through the tele-
scopes were a slight accentuation of its ruggedness and
a clearer presentation of its strange white rays

  the moons strengthened hold on the tides had become
apparent but not to an alarming degree wave-lashed

st helena reported the highest tides in the islands
history and the spray was reaching new heights on the
rocks of new englands shore and on the shores of the
british isles but the oceans as a whole seemed as
placid as ever

  minor climatic changes also had been noted with the
globe speeding faster on its axis it was absorbing less
of the suns heat winter still lingered in the north
temperate regions while the settlements near the arctic
circle reported the severest temperatures in years and
rogerland near the north pole broadcast the news that
its people were becoming alarmed over the movement of
the surrounding glaciers which were threatening to en-
circle the valley completely

  so the possibility of the earth becoming frigid at an
early date struck a new note of terror in the first days
of the great change but humanity which had waxed
strangely fatalistic under the moon menace showed no
symptoms of new pandemonium even when professor
sherard and other authorities announced that the polar
ice fields would probably break loose from their founda-
tions and begin to shift toward the equator within two
months

  all kinds of bizarre suggestions for stopping the moon
were offered the one that attracted most attention
was that huge atomotors equipped with dashers be
manufactured by hundreds of thousands and used to
churn the seas into tides that might cause the satellite
to recede churches of all creeds united in supplications
and on a specified sunday prayers ascended simultane-
ously from more than fifty million lips five thousand
members of a transcendental sect gathered in chicago
and solemnly declared that mans united will-power
could hold the moon in check many islamites believed
that mohammed was returning on the moon and that it
would retreat after coming close enough for his white
horse to bring him to earth

chapter v
mildred

ernest sherard had an assistant other than
professor burke in his work at mount shasta-
one who meant more to him than the work itself

  he had met mildred reamer six years before when
he was a tyro astronomer

  one night a child the daughter of the widowed keeper
of the tenement where his meagre observatory was lo-
cated had climbed to his attic workshop and watched
him intently as he nosed his telescope through the dorm-
er window and aimed it at the stars

  please sir let me look through the big gun the
child asked

  he focused the small but powerful instrument on
many-mooned jupiter and asked the girl to see how
many little stars she could find around it

  oh god how beautiful the child exclaimed after
viewing the planet for a minute oh god how beau-
tiful

  and every following night as long as he stayed under
mrs reamers roof the child looked through the big
gun evincing an inordinate interest for one so young
she soon learned the names of all the planets and could
soon locate the brighter stars and some of the constella-
tions attracted by the childs astronomic precocity
the young lunarian spent many hours telling her the
secrets of the heavens and pointing out to her until
she could describe them as well as he the principal
features of his favorite object of study the mystic moon
mildred became so enraptured in lunar observation that
he playfully called her the moon girl and when he
left mrs reamers house to pursue his work in more
pretentious quarters mildred was not forgotten she
continued to visit his observatory learning more and


amazing stories quarterly

more about the universe and after her mothers death
he saw to her education and then engaged her as his
secretary and assistant

  and now the moon girl was burgeoning into the
full bloom of young womanhood radiantly beautiful
his interest in her had grown into adoration and the
time for taking her had almost come no word of love
had been spoken but mildred understood

  the great change had not frightened the girl she
looked upon it as the great adventure of course i
hope the moon will hurry back she said to ernest one
day but if it must come on i hope it comes close
enough for us to visit it wouldnt it be wonderful
if you and i should be the first man and maid to make
the trip

  ernest caught the twinkle of adventure in her violet
eyes and replied only one thing would please me
better-to find a way to make the moon go back yes
it would be wonderful to reach the satellite and explore
its peaks and craters maybe we could decipher the
strange writing on mount iladley and learn the secret
of tychos great rays and the moon may come close
enough for such a visit-perhaps too close even now
the world is dying the days are getting colder the
ocean more restless unless luna ceases her onward
swing it will be all over in three months

  three months mildred exclaimed so soon as
that

  yes the ice fields are already beginning to break
up and within a few weeks another glacial age will
be upon us in earnest and then within three months
the tides will have lashed the oceans from their beds
the icy waters covering nearly all the globe the greatly
increased rotation of the earth and the moving of the
ice fields may cause the sphere to shift on its axis and
even though the shift does not come it is certain that
the acceleration will shake the earth to its foundations

  chaos mildred meditated i have often wondered
what the end of the world would be like and have been
so wicked as to imagine i would enjoy witnessing it as
a child i used to picture some comet or other interstellar
visitor colliding with our planet and once i dreamed
that the moon fell back upon the earth and now that
very thing is about to happen not that i want the world
to end but i have often thought that if such must occur
i would be glad to be living at the time it would be
thrilling awe-inspiring i know it is strange that i
should feel this way but its a part of my nature i
guess the surge of life within me always seems high-
est when the elements are most belligerent the louder
the thunder the brighter the lightning the more alive
i seem to be

  this strange quirk in the girls make-up was not new
to ernest she had been an odd child in many ways
back in the old days when he was a lodger in her
mothers home she often crept up to his attic on stormy
nights to view the raging elements from the coign of
the dormer window and would clap her hands in delight
at each blinding hash and its resultant reverberation
happiest when the storm was at its worst

  in fine the girl seemed to find an eerie sort of ex-
hilaration in defying the elements he recalled an in-
cident that occurred when she was about fourteen years
old he had taken her and her mother to the seashore
for a sunday afternoon outing a severe storm came
up and during the darkness that preceded the gales fury
the girl clad in her bathing suit disappeared half an
hour later while the storm wa at its ugliest pitch he
found her poised tip-toe atop a beetling crag at the
oceans edge facing the terrible splendor of the light-
ning-lashed sky and the storm-tossed sea her arms out-
stretched as if to embrace the gale and become a part of
it a look of mingled defiance and happiness on her face
he stood there fully a minute watching the spray dash

over her lissom form and play with her soft brown hair

  oh god how wonderful the child exclaimed as he
took her by the arm let me stay

  mildred i believe you are the daughter of old thor
himself he told her as he led her away

  and in that moment he realized that the child was
blossoming into maidenhood and that he loved her   
even more than she loved the storm

chapter vi

chaos beckons

ten weeks had passed since the beginning of the
end-that is it would have been the middle of
june but for the shortening of the days true to
professor sherards prediction the moon had gained
momentum and was now advancing nearly three thou-
sand milesa day it was less than  miles away
and nearlyten hours had been deducted from the twenty-
four shaken by earthquakes of unprecedented violence
the earth seemed unable to bear its travail mountain-
high tides lashed to demoniac fury by the moons ter-
rific pull were threatening the very heart of the con-
tinents it was a repetition of the noachian flood but
far more cataclysmic in its terrible grandeur and
over all was spreading the death-cold from the great
white spaces the seas were becoming clogged with
glaciers some of which were already upon the con-
tinents

  chaos was beckoning

  gone was nearly every coast city in the world new
york was one of the first metropolises to vanish the
florida peninsula had disappeared almost entirely lon-
don and nearly all of the british isles were under the
sea earthquakes and tides had combined to submerge
the japanese isles and much of the coast of asia while
the tides alone had conquered the coasts of nearly every
other continent it was estimated that about an eighth
of the land was already submerged

  stark terror again and incipient insanity commerce
abandoned forgotten men of all bloods fleeing to moun-
tains and plateaus forgetting everything except the will
to live and again asking but one question is this the
end fleeing by day and by night in a hodge-podge
hegira gazing helplessly hopelessly at the advancing-
ogress of the skies the hideous gloating moon

  hundreds of thousands of the inhabitants of small and
remote islands had perished when their lands were sub-
merged and tens of thousands in other parts of the world
had died in earthquakes japan was literally cracked to
pieces before the waters engulfed it and most of its
inhabitants had fled to china otherwise little loss of life
had been occasioned by the first convulsions of the great
change the frenzy of the seas had in most places
developed gradually and the initial exodus from the coast
regions was orderly less than a hundred lives had
been lost in new york but now with the waters
threatening to reach the plateaus and the ice flows from
the arctic advancing humanitys trek to higher ground
was becoming a disorganized cluttering retreat

  atoplanes and atomobiles of every description had
been commandeered by the governments and put back
into service to expedite the exodus the ban on atomic
energy being suspended for the emergency but all
means of transportation were proving inadequate and
millions of the panic-stricken peoples were making the
journey to the interior on foot

  paris and berlin still were safe and were the meccas
of millions of gregarious europeans despite the warning
that these cities soon must go north americans were
scurrying like ants to the central plains notwithstand-
ing the admonition that this would be the first part of
the continent to receive the gelid waters from the north
and from the oceans overflow pushing its way up the
the moon of doom



mississippi and that the western mountain ranges and
the higher appalachians would be their safest refuge
likewise the coat inhabitants of south america were
moving to the amazon and parana lowlands instead of
to the andes africans were crowding the sahara table-
lands ignoring the atlas mountains in the north aus-
tralians were migrating to the western plateau asiat-
ics alone were climbing the mountains and this because
of the interior location of the ranges and plateaus the
himalayas and the kuenluns were their main objectives

  the primordial instinct of all animal life to seek
safety in flight and to travel as far as possible from
the scene of immediate danger was asserting itself
in the face of the great terror man the super-animal
was atavistic

  communication with rogerland had ceased abruptly
two weeks since and it was believed that the country
had been crushed under mountains of ice the last mes-
sage having stated that the glaciers shaken from their
bases and set in motion by earthshocks were closing in
rapidly many of the inhabitants of this valley had
escaped however and were reported making their way
south through canada the people of which country also
were joining in the migration to the central plains of
the united states before the approaching dominion of
ice whose coming was heralded by intense cold

  the chilling blasts from the arctic also had hastened
the exodus from the northern parts of europe and asia
while far to the south in the outposts near the ant-
arctic circle a frenzied trek toward the equator was in
progress

  the problem of food distribution was forgotten in
the great hegira and thousands of refugees from every
land were dying of hunger and cold

  wild animal life from the arctic wildernesses also
was fleeing before the ice terror while millions of
feathered creatures from both the north and south
polar regions were winging their way toward more favor-
able climes

  and during the great debacle science was as helpless
to stop the stampede of humanity as it was to halt the
oncoming moon and restore the cosmic equilibrium its
advice its admonitions were for the most part un-
heeded though a small minority was listening and pro-
ceeding in orderly manner to gain the temporary safety
of the highlands these were carrying with them many
of the conveniences of civilization large stores of food
heavy clothing and equipment for hastily erecting abodes
on the lofty land already many improvised dwellings
were appearing high on the mountains and in some
places principally on the plateaus communities were
being formed keeping in touch with the rest of the world
by radio

  highways to all of the interior cities of the united
states were becoming cluttered with refugees from the
coast regions many of whom were pitching tents or
building shacks on the outskirts of the towns because
of its proximity to the geographical center of the coun-
try omaha nebraska was becoming the nations most
populous city the destruction of new york and other
large cities on the atlantic seaboard had at first poured
much of the population of this region into chicago
detroit and other points in the great lakes country
but the cold and the menace of the tides soon drove the
wanderers onward again the vanguard of the second
exodus had moved on to omaha and the bulk of the
hysterical masses followed blindly then came the time
when earthquakes added to the terrors of the wave-
lashed pacific coast and the refugees from the west
as gregarious as their eastern brothers also descended
on the nebraska city ignoring en route denver and
other safer cities high in the rockies

  other towns in nebraska kansas and the plains states
in general were feeling the effects of the stampede but

omaha was the chief camp of the hapless hordes and
was to continue as such until the day of its doom
humanity in its supreme peril was huddling together
helpless and leaderless but seeking safety in numbers
as of old

chapter vii

the gty of dementia

the malefic moon continued to advance and the
dizzy parent-sphere to increase its breakneck whirl-
ing the gasping days to shorten the bitter cold
to creep

  and science remained as impotent as on the first day
of the great change but science had not abandoned
hope and was trying desperately to restore the reason
of a world gone mad    trying in vain

  north americans continued to flock to the central
plains omaha was the hub of an expanse of souls that
stretched nearly fifty miles in every direction in a
seething ferment by day the refugees sought to es-
tablish a semblance of order tens of thousands of
tents and other crude shelter structures were going up
each day even atoplanes and atomobiles were being
dismantled and their metal converted into material for
shacks by night the inhabitants of the city of demen-
tia did little but discuss incoherently the moon menace
and gaze at the ever-growing satellite whose beauty now
had changed into the loathsomeness of death itself and
try to forget their terror in fitful slumber-and so short
had the nights become there wasnt much time for
sleeping so brief the daylight night and day seemed
one

  the government of the united states was still intact
though the administrative departments had been moved
to the resort buildings on mount mitchell the highest
peak in eastern america as soon as the tides threatened
washington a gigantic radio station had been erected
atop the mountain and the government was keeping in
touch with the rest of the world and trying to calm
its own populace the president was making impas-
sioned appeals to the people to seek safety elsewhere
than on the plains but his pleas like those of science
were all but disregarded

  nearly all the government atoplanes and other vehicles
of transportation had been assembled at asheville and
hendersonville near mount mitchell and were used to
carry food and clothing to the refugees at omaha and
other places all available supplies of this nature had
been commandeered for the purpose

  the suffering in omaha and its newly acquired en-
virons was intense thousands of families had arrived
in this false refuge penniless and without provisior-
scarcity of water also was being felt huge mains were
being run from omaha reservoirs to outlying districts
but the supply was inadequate and wells were being dug
everywhere the crowded unsanitary conditions be-
spoke inevitable epidemics of disease

  the soul of the city of dementia like its physical
side defied description albert simmons noted poet
called the place the city of unmasked men and this
was probably the most expressive epitome the con-
tentions of science that civilization was only a thin veneer
and that man was his real self only when released com-
pletely from social restraints or when facing death was
being proved in a graphic piteous way

  the soul of man was stripped bare revealing its
paradoxes of good and evil beauty and ugliness virtue
and vice hope and despair paradox of love and hate
of avarice and benevolence of vicariousness and selfish-
ness of spirituality and materialism-such was man in
the city of his last stand	e

  insanity perhaps but sanity too is but a thin veneer
and the strangest paradox of all was mans cupidity
in his hour of travail in the face of annihilation


amazing stories quarterly

  the peddler crying his wares the merchant display-
ing his stock the millionaire flaunting his wealth-they
were there ere the mecca of misery was two weeks old
and shylock too was there

  business as usual the omaha newspapers crowd-
ing moon news with closing out advertisements the
sign of the three balls here and there for sale at
worlds-end prices signs tacked on many a mercantile
shack in the crowded crazy streets food and clothing
commanding fabulous prices atomobile salesmen dis-
playing the newest electrically equipped models men
forgetting the moon menace in their inherent desire to
accumulate wealth forgetting the miserable masses
around them forgetting in measure their own suffer-
ing selling the very water from the newly dug wells

  and the ubiquitous life insurance man also was on the
scene-doing a big business thank you

  man was truly mad    had always been mad deep in
the recesses of his brain where was stored the greed
that had its birth when his hairy ancestor in the first
days of the bow and arrow stocked his cave with meat
until the stench drove him out

  morals proprieties were almost forgotten ii the bed-
lam what mattered they now when every soul was
bared man was a brute an abysmal brute and womans
soul was little fairer many and brazen were the painted
women many and shameless the roues

  but all was not ugly in the great unveiling if evil
predominated it should be remembered that terror and
suffering are cousins germane to insanity and insanity
the true parent of crime the fact that no man with
the right kind of brain with the intellect he should have
could be criminal had long been recognized by both

science and religion this was the reason why nearly
all prisons had evolved into hospitals at the beginning
of the twenty-first century

  but there were no hospitals for the sick people of the
city of delirium

  the eternal forces of good and evil were still at work
over the outlying stretches of hunger and misery away

ernest started the puissant motors they were oft
goodbye dear world cried mildred farewell
mean macrocosm grunted professor burke

from the frenzied trading marts was held the white
hand of charity and over the forms of those to whom the
great change had already brought death were said the
gentle prayers of faith and hope religion was there
all creeds uniting in the final test but all these benefi-
cent agencies could do but little to relieve the suffering
banish the terror or restore the sanity of the great
ferment

  and religion itself as fear and misery grew threat-
ened to become fanatic if not barbarous a great evan-
gelical leader unbalanced by the chaos already was ad-
vocating human sacrifices to appease the wrath of the
heavens

  philosophy also was becoming warped and nearly
every man was a philosopher with divergent views the
cold air of night was rent by the strident voices of
the moon of doom



these sages who mounted soap-boxes and what-nots to
expound their theories as to the why the whence and
the whither

  stoicism was gaining ground as hope diminished a
familiar figure among the oratorical contingent was a
bent and bearded man clad in winding white like the
prophets of old who would point a bony finger at his
auditors and mock what if this is the end of the
world you wont know the difference in a thousand
years youre no more than a bag of gnats anyhow

chapter viii

professor burke growls

professors sherard and burke from their re-
treat on mount shasta sent out daily messages to
the world warning the people to flee the valleys and
pleading with the inhabitants of the city of dementia
to scatter to the hills and though these two astronomers
were now recognized as the chief savants of the great
change their appeals had little effect

  let them stop the moon-then well listen to them
was the response of the stricken the doomed as they
continued to mass in the lowlands

  feverish and almost ceaseless work to find some way
to combat the moon-pulling magnetism had overtaxed
ernest sherards energy and impaired his health a
nervous collapse had threatened and mildred was now
nursing him back to normal

  failure to discover a world-saving force had not vis-
ibly perturbed the robust cynical professor francis
burke

  maybe the world isnt worth saving anyway he
growled one day after a particularly promising thread
of investigation snapped maybe chaos annihilation
were better after all earth has always been an accursed
planet

  sour grapes mildred chided

   make wine that does lifes sourness dissipate as
omar khayyam might have said he returned

  old omar he is ernests favorite philosopher
mildred said turning to sherard but i guess ernest
is losing respect for the tentmaker now for it was he
who said

    when you and i behind the veil are past

     oh but the long long while the world shall last 

  but omar knew what he was talking about after all
burke submitted bear witness the last two lines of
the quatrain

    which of our coming and departure heeds
    as the seas self should heed a pebble-cast 

  professor you are as hopeless as ever ernest
laughed

  and it strikes me that the world is more so just
now burke parried where is the civilization we
boasted a few short weeks ago the age of intellect
bah the waves pounce on the shores and wipe out a
few cities and civilization reverts to barbarism over-
night threatened with destruction humanity is brave
as a lot of frightened hares rational as a bunch of cor-
nered rats docile as a herd of hyenas civilization is
not even a thin veneer-it is but a daub of whitewash
and when the whitewash is gone man stands revealed
as the craven coward he has always been when unable
to dominate when faced by the unknown stripped of
the last vestige of his semi-sanity he now scurries to
the central lowlands despite all warnings he still fol-
lows the crowd gregarious to the end but the globe
is singing its swan song and in a few weeks it will all
be over-so let the fools go and after all why should
death on the mountains be preferable to death on the
plains yes maybe the fools are right-a month or two

of life doesnt matter when the earth itself is dying
that damned moon why did it come to be in the
first place it has done nothing but grin at earth since
it took its place in the sky looks pretty to lovers eh
bah its gloating over us now and all the kings
horses cant efface its hellish grin

  professor burke still raging left the room and as-
cended to the observation room for another look at the
sinister satellite they did not laugh at their com-
panions outburst-they felt he had voiced the grim
truth

  the professor is right as usual but hes so brutally
frank about it ernest remarked as he wheeled the
lens on the moon were it not so characteristic of
him id say that the impending destruction is getting on
his nerves he discovered the great change you know
and i believe he thinks the burden of correcting the
trouble lies chiefly on his shoulders he is one of the
most pessimistic men i have ever known but he didnt
mean what he said about the world not being worth
saving in fact he is the kind of fellow that would not
hesitate to give his own life to save a friend a most
unusual character a bit too gloomy but one of the great-
est astronomers and thinkers in the world he wa
right about the folly of trying to beat the great change
and death on the plains being no worse than on the
hills

  but you havent given up all hope mildred com-
mented you still believe that something may happen
to save the world dont you

  yes but i dont let my hopes delude me it has been
said you know that hope is the worlds greatest liar
something may occur-the moon may fly to pieces but
the doom of humanity seems sealed a few short weeks
will tell the story the moon will crash into the earth
or the icy death from the oceans will submerge all
another bubble in the universe will have burst thats
all they must all burst sooner or later you know
the eternal ruthless law of change mildred sighed
i like the way it was expressed in a poem i read not
long ago

    yes all that is must change and pass away

    thus speak the falling petals of the rose

    the sun that kisses junes warm lips today
    must glisten soon on bleak decembers snows

  and will you be afraid mildred in the dusk of earths
last day

  she smiled into his solicitous gray eyes and replied
with another verse of the poem

     when evening comes and shadows round me creep
    why should i fear to face the common fate

    death at its worst is but eternal sleep-

     perchance it is the road to edens gate 

  the poem is a strange mixture of materialistic mel-
ancholy and hope ernest commented professor
burke might have written it

  no he would have omitted the eden part even
though it is figurative for he doesnt believe in the
genesis account and he would have feared thered be
an eve in the garden

  the professor is a genuine specimen of the genus
woman-hater but he doesnt hate you mildred only
the other day he told me it would make his life worth
living to have a daughter like you

  the colloquy ended they looked once more at the leer-
ing lesser light

chapter ix
the people of the peaks

what should have been five months had passed
since the beginning of the lunar horror the
moon was only seventy-seven thousand miles away
the earth was revolving in less than eight hours man


amazing stories quarterly

had lost track of time the calendar was a mockery

  of the globes dry surface only the mountains and
some of the higher plateaus remained and on these
peaks and tablelands in every country were crowded
about ten million souls-the remnant of humanity

  the civilization which man had been ten thousand
years building had vanished almost as completely as
though it had never existed somewhere beneath the
vastitude of heaving ice-choked waters lay the ruins
of every great city that man had caused to be each
earthly metropolis had become a marine necropolis
each continent would soon be one with atlantis nep-
tune was chortling

  congregant to the end earths billions had been
caught between the glacial avalanches from the poles
and the marching waters from the seven seas they had
remained huddled on the plains until retreat was too
late-huddled for warmth as well as through unreason-
ing fear and when the oceans pushing their way up
the river valleys had actually reached the plains and the
ice mountains were beginning to slither down and into
the basins they had rushed crazed and achephalous
for higher land millions who had escaped the debacle
were frozen to death or perished of exhaustion or hunger
and countless other millions were whipped under the
flood before they could reach even the foothills

  of the forty million refugees at omaha less than three
hundred thousand reached the mountains they had
perished like rats in a flooded sewer like bagged cats
tossed into a creek denver was the gathering ground
of probably a hundred thousand of the sanest and the
fleetest

  and those who had reached the temporary safety of
the highlands were in a plight that called to death
shelterless almost foodless hopeless almost witless they
surged together for mutual warmth and commiseration
gazing alternately piteously at the gargoyle hideousness
of the moon and the ever-climbing seas

  terror and suffering had reduced the mass of the
stricken to little more than automatons man was no
longer a thinking creature his instincts alone sur-
vived he had ceased to ponder over the moon menace
seeming to accept it as something that had always ex-
isted he knew fear pain and hunger as they were
known by the wild things of the field and forest he
was mad but it was the dumb insanity of an animal
tortured into submission he no longer cared for his
kind he was hungry and he ate whatever came to
hand he slew with rocks and clubs the animals that
had preceded him to the mountains devoured their raw
flesh and drank their warm blood he munched the
foliage and the roots of trees and shrubs he was cold
and he sought body warmth of his kind and dug holes
in the snow and under the rocks at first he had made
fire from spruce and pine but so rapid was his retro-
gression that he forgot how to produce flame within
three weeks after reaching the mountains he had
harked back to the troglodyte

  gone was the grip of greed and vice that had fettered
mans soul in the early days of the great change gone
too was every virtue save the imperishable one of
mother love which amid the indescribable phantasma-
goria of insanity and suffering still sacrificed itself on
the altar of devotion that pallid babes might live another
day

  gone was everything but the will to live which is
always strongest when life is weakest and when erebus
claims the mind

  only a handful of refugees of the last exodus had
reached the higher mountains where were pitched the
camps of those who fled when the waves first began to
wreck the shores most of them had stopped on the
lower ranges whence further migration was soon blocked
by the rapidly ascending seas many of the smaller

mountain chains were now almost completely submerged
their peaks rising out of the water like south sea isles
hordes of the stricken in the city of dementia had fled
to the nearest mountains the ozarks less than a dozen
of whose summits now remained above the water others
had sought refuge on the loftier appalachians but many
of these mountains also were quickly submerged and the
waters from the atlantic were now cutting huge gorges
through their blue fastnesses as they rushed inland to
merge with the flood from the pacific which balked at
first by the defiant ranges near the coast now was
sweeping through in numerous places as a result of
corrosion and of earthquakes which had all but leveled
hundreds of snow-crowned monarchs

  the president and his cabinet and the various ad-
ministrative departments were marooned on mount
mitchell the government had long since ceased to
function but was still keeping in communication with
the few remaining radio stations of the world the loft-
iest observatories and the most altitudinous communi-
ties of peak-dwellers

  in striking contrast with the surrounding mental
chaos was the status of the pioneers of the great hegira
-the small minority who had sought the highest land
when science and government first advised here the
mind of man was keeping its dominion facing the in-
evitable with inordinate courage and sanity striving to
maintain order to the last

  these people of the peaks had quickly organized for
the work at hand and their co-operation and foresight
had created a cliff-dwelling society of comparative com-
fort coming to the mountains largely in atoplanes
and bringing generous stores of concentrated food cloth-
ing and equipment including many atoheaters they had
immediately set about making the most of their desperate
situation against the time when the glacial weather
would envelope the cliffs in a shroud of ice they soon
abandoned their tents and other temporary dwellings
and dug deep into the mountainsides where they fash-
ioned large rooms and passageways using atorays to
melt the solid rock and when the tedious task was
over they had equipped their dens with atolights ato-
heaters and radio sets their nourishment consisted
principally of canned goods and concentrated food
water was obtained from the mountain rivulets and
later when these small streams congealed by melting
snow and ice as a precaution against the time when
earthquakes would threaten their dug-outs forcing them
to flee to other peaks they kept their atoplanes ready
for instant service storing them in specially tunneled
garages

  these arrangements though entailing many hard-
ships had staved off actual suffering for many weeks
but the great change was not to be outdone they
were now virtually sealed in their cells no longer did
they dare to brave the intense cold of the high altitudes
they crowded round their atoheaters through brief
days and brief nights talking in hushed tones eating
their condensed food and sleeping much of the time like
hibernating animals every few hours a squad of men
armed with atorays and pickaxes would go to the cavern
doors and cut away the ice sheets to provide ventilation
and anon some more rugged cliff-dweller would emerge
from the warmth of the caves long enough to train a
telescope on the raging ice-jammed waters below or to
glimpse the bloated bloodshot moon

  and these people of the peaks were beginning to
notice another ominous change the very air was van-
ishing

chapter x
the moon breatlis

luna whose praises poets had sung adown the ages
whose light had illumined the eyes of love since
love first came to be had long since ceased to be a
the moon of doom



tiling of beauty more wondrously beautiful than ever
she would have appeared however had she been planet-
bound on a kindly mission for beauty too is
relative

  the moon was now a monstrous brazen ball dimly
incardined whose bulk blotted out so much of the sky
that an almost ecliptic darkness shot through with eld-
ritch colors veiled the world even at meridian and
at night there seemed to be nothing but moon-and each
night the moon waxed larger more malevolent another
weird effect was the frequency of eclipses on both the
earth and moon caused by the nearness of the two bodies

  the satellite had lost all likeness to the golden disk
that once adorned the canopy the change was as start-
ling as complete its human face had long since dis-
appeared and in its stead loomed a terrible topography
of gaunt mountains yawing chasms and pock-marked
plains all plainly discernible without the aid of the
telescope the craters of copernicus clavius and tycho
were especially conspicuous and from the latter ring
the strange white rays stretched uniformly in every
direction like streamers of marble expertly designed
the long swath of the alpine valley was another prom-
inent feature while the apennines and the carpathian
mountains were so distinct that their jagged peaks could
be seen protruding in serrate outline from the face of
the satellite which now appeared slightly convex

  as its orbit narrowed the moons librations had be-
come more pronounced and its north and south caps were
inclined in turn more and more toward the earth time
on the satellite also had been disrupted as it were its
periods of day and night having decreased it had de-
creased its distance from the earth by approximately

	miles since the beginning of its earthward jaunt
and the corresponding shrinkage of its orbit had reduced
its fortnights of light and darkness to less than five
days each

  poets had always been at odds as to the color of the
moon some singing its silvery light and others its
golden luster but now the orb was neither argentine
nor aureate its general color was that of burnished
brass as seen under a red light its radiance was dim-
ming rapidly and it was strange to note that the black
shadows of its mountains were becoming less distinct

  the change was even more remarkable as seen through
the observatory telescopes every feature was brought
within touching distance it seemed by the giant lenses
astronomers now saw the wrinkled countenance of the
moon almost as plainly as if they were on its very sur-
face and its color under the glasses was dull gray

  the proximity of the satellite had brought much new
knowledge of its physical characteristics its mountains
were shown to be more complex than had been thought
and science now was certain that the alpine valley was
the result of the contact of some wandering celestial
body its craters appeared to be the remains or bases
of gigantic bubbles raised by volcanic gasses when the
globe was molten

  there was no sign of life on the sphere but evidence
that it once had been peopled was indisputable the
discovery that received most attention was that a gar-
gantuan gargoyle figure was carved on the side of mount
hadley near the strange markings which professor
burke had discovered its features were too indistinct
to provide a clear picture as for the hieroglyphics
science now was certain that they contained mathemat-
ical calculations

  the bolometers showed that the moons temperature
was not nearly so low has had been reckoned and that
its surface was reflecting an appreciable amount of the
suns heat-about one th part whether this
fact was occasioned by the globes nearness to the earth
was a matter of conjecture during the moons stygian
night however the temperature fell to nearly one hun-

dred and fifty degrees below zero but this was not so
cold as science had estimated

  professors sherard and burke in their atoheated ob-
servatory were spending nearly every available minute
studying the satellite and mildred reamer was fairly
enrapt the three pondered long over the hieroglyph-
ics on mount hadley seeking a deciphering clue which
ernest believed lay in the mathematical arrangements

  i would like to know their significance even at this
late day in the worlds life he told mildred one night
i believe they are records left by a dying race and
that weird figure up there must be that of a lunar god
i wonder why i couldnt see it before the great change
occurred it must be that its outlines are not as con-
spicuous as those of the hieroglyphics but i could
swear now that it has two great glittering eyes it is
strange though that no other signs of lunar civiliza-
tion can be detected the moonman must have lived in
houses of some sort and built temples to their deities
it seems that such structures should still be in a fair
state of preservation due to the absence of air

  well if such ruins exist they must be on the other
side of the moon mildred said as she took her eyes
from the reflector and of course thats not prob-
able as the temperature on the other side must be in-
conceivably low the other side of the moon how i
should like to explore it and something tells me that
i shall some day the moon has always called to me
and now when it is so close that it seems i could reach
up and touch it i am tempted to stretch out my hands
and cry for it as they tell me i did when i was a baby
it seems to be drawing me toward it even as it is pull-
ing the tides i wonder why

  because you are still my moon girl ernest laughed
and then tenderly your wish may be fulfilled after
all let me tell you a secret i am planning to set sail
for the moon when life on this globe is no longer pos-
sible and i think the voyage can be made of course
you shall go with me-you and professor burke
mildred looked at him with the open eyes of wonder
joyous excitement and anticipation shown in them when
she found voice

  wonderful do you really mean it ernest tell
me how you intend to make the trip

  look into the reflector again he answered now
study the shadows of the apennines closely and tell me
what you see

their edges are no longer hard and black she said
after a minutes observation they are much less dis-
tinct than they were a week ago what does it mean
it means ernest replied slowly that there is air
on the moon-the moon is breathing at last

  and how do you account for it

  we have already noticed that our atmosphere is at-
tenuating the very air is gasping for breath in my
opinion there is but one answer it is being draum to
the moon

chapter ix

let us go

iiree days later professor sherard made an even
more astounding discovery

  the moon was slowing down

  trigonometrical calculations showed that the sinister
satellite was now approaching the earth at a rate of
 miles in twenty-four hours-nearly three hundred
less than its speed of a week before

  ernest sherard immediately flashed this intelligence
to the remaining observatories and the radio stations of
the cliff people the discovery was seconded at once by
other astronomers including professor josephus sayre
of yerkes i congratulate you professor sayres
voice came through the air you have made every im-
portant discovery since burke discovered the great
amazing stories quarterly

         splendor that dazzled blinded only to
give new sight	the sun with its rerf

robes of flame fluttering five hundred thousand
miles in space	tho prodigious moon it-

self	and back of all the erebus of

unreverberatc space

however its poising period will not occur until it is
within twenty-five thousand miles it will then begin
to recede repeating its journey of millions of years
ago

  and the moon will recede for the same reason as in
that remote time the tides will again have their re-
venge

  the terrific force of the tides lashed from their
beds by the moon itself is counteracting the pull of the
earths atomic magnetism and there is reason to be-
lieve that the magnetism itself is vanishing-probably
being carried into space with the earths atmosphere
though it may be that this agent which caused the
great change is being naturally dissipated recent
findings indicate that the magnetism is less potent on
water than on land if this is true it is likely that
it will entirely disappear after all the earth is under
the seas

  when the moon has attained a proximity of about
twenty-five thousand miles another glacial age will
have truly come upon the earth though our globe may
become a ball of ice like the distant planets neptune
and uranus it is possible that the fury of the tides will
prevent the waters congealing as a whole however
there will be icebergs rivaling mount everest in size
moreover the sorely perplexed planet will be all but split
asunder by centrifugal force which is already manifest-
ing itself in cataclysmic earthquakes but the world
will survive because of its density were it a molten
mass as in the days when it gave birth to the moon it

change itself but i am on the trail of something big
myself whats the matter with the shadows on the
moon

  the next day professor sherard broadcast his last
words to the world it was the message of the last
hope a call for migration to the moon

  let every atoliner and atoplane be made ready im-
mediately and all of the open machines hulled in to
withstand the cold of space he urged the moon
offers the only refuge if any of earths inhabitants are
to survive

  the moon is only sixty-six thousand miles way
he continued within a normal week it will be not
less than fifty thousand despite its retarded progress
then its tides will leap higher than our loftiest peaks
many of which will be destroyed by earthquake or un-
dermined by the flood

  during the past two normal weeks the earth has
lost approximately one-eighth of its atmosphere un-
accountably the air is being drawn to the moon within
two more weeks the satellite should have enough air to
support human life

  the moon has slowed down about three hundred
miles a day its speed will diminish steadily until it
comes to a full stop poised in space in all probability
the moon of doom



is likely that it would provide its offspring a sister sat-
ellite

  whether the moon will recede as fast as it approached
the earth is a matter of conjecture science popularly
holds that the sphere left the earth very hesitantly and
that it took the tides countless millions of years to drive
it the distance it had attained prior to the great change
but there is another theory which has been gaining
ground and upon the truth of which depends the possi-
bility of any of earths inhabitants returning in event
they reach the moon this is the bartonian theory
advanced two decades ago it holds that the moon when
it first left the earth hurried away at a rate of sev-
eral thousand miles a day its speed gradually diminish-
ing as the tidal reaction lessened until when it had gone
about  miles its own gravitation almost counter-
balanced the recalcitrant tides and that it then all but
paused its further recession being a matter of millions
of years barton also believed that the moon then
had a good atmosphere losing it by imperceptible de-
grees as it receded

  i have never been an exponent of this theory but
let us hope it is true after all with the moon 
miles away life on the earth would be possible and
perhaps the earth people who succeeded in reaching the
satellite could then return but if the accepted version
of the moons history is correct return would be im-
possible for the reason that the earth would continue its
breakneck rotation and be hidden under a gelid sea for
millions of years

  there is every reason tobelieve that the moon will
soon be habitable the presence of air has been estab-
lished beyond doubt and more of our atmosphere will
accrue to it as it advances its climate is becoming
warmer each day as a result of its atmosphere retaining
more and more of the suns heat immense variations
of temperature are to be expected however due to its
long periods of light and darkness but the extremes
will not be so pronounced as formerly as its days and
nights have shortened in keeping with the narrowing of
its orbit

  i am confident that our atoplanes will have little
difficulty in reaching the moon but they will not be
able to attain anything like their earthly speed due
to the thinness of the intervening air it would be
foolhardy of course to attempt the flight in other than
hulled planes and these machines must be supplied
with an abundance of atoheat we cannot hope to find
food on the moon and the absence of water must be
anticipated though it is very probable that the satellite
will have clouds and rain when its atmosphere becomes
denser also a supply of oxygen should be provided
for an emergency and it would be well for each ship to
carry a small radio set

  let each plane store as much condensed food and
as much water as possible and each passenger pro-
vided the heaviest clothing available it might also be
well to carry along the seeds of some of our hardiest
food plants

  the moon voyage offers the only hope slight though
it is and should be attempted as early as possible it
is not certain of course that a single earthian is de-
stined to land on the satellite and that even though the
trip is made all will not perish up there but it were
better to die in a last desperate attempt than to help-
lessly await extinction on this planet

  we will defy the great change at its worst let us
bo

             chapter xii
             mans last stand

the radio carried professor sherards words to less
than seventy-five thousand people though it flashed
to nearly every ear on the globe of terras in-
habitants all had perished with the exception of the

people on the peaks and a handful in the observatories

  of the hundreds of thousands of hapless souls who
had been stranded on the lower mountains after linger-
ing too long on the plains not a trace remained even
the city of denver was no more

  and merciful were the tides that swept the last of
them away-more merciful than the pitiless cold that
killed slowly and terribly more compassionate than the
dumb terror that blotted out their minds more exorable
than the heartless hunger that caused them in the last
days of their horrible travail to kill and devour their
own kind

  bereft of the last trace of sanity and soul rendered
atavistic below the level of the abysmal brute these
veriest victims of the great change had all but vanished
ere the waters gulped them down by the tens of thou-
sands they had been felled by cold and hunger and
it was in the last days that man always a carnivore had
reverted to cannibalism-but man was less than man in
that dark time creatures that crawl around on all
fours and jabber and yowl are not human neither does
man rend with tooth and claw and see through red-green
eyes

  and at the close when the fiendish fulsome moon was
almost upon them and the diabolic tides lashed at them
from below the remnant of these penultimate survivors
were as wolves gone mad quadrupedal and truly lupine
they were howling their hellish ululations at the heavens
until the merciful seas climbed up and drowned their
lamentations

  many of the more fortunate cliff-dwellers had wit-
nessed through their telescopes the frightful transition
from man to beast enacted on the sea-encircled hills be-
low but the death-cold that kept them in their caverns
toward the last mercifully prevented their viewing the
foul finale the wails of the human ghouls had how-
ever ascended to their habitations above the raving
of the tides and winds splitting their ears like blas-
phemies from the pit itself

  hundreds of the peak people themselves had suc-
cumbed to the intense cold which entering their re-
treats through the ventilation openings defied their ato-
heat it had been necessary to enlarge the ice-cluttered
entrances as the air rarefied and then when numbness
chained them down the ice had all but sealed them in
their cells the majority had survived however their
number being about sixty-five thousand the other ten
thousand survivors were astronomers and co-scientists
who had successfully combated with an abundance of ato-
heat the cold that stormed their observatories and ref-
ugees who had been given asylum there in the early
days of the great change

  the cliff folk on receipt of professor sherards last
message lost no time in preparing for the lunar flight
most of their atoplanes and their few giant atoliners
had been kept in readiness in their mountain tunnels
but most of the smaller machines had to be hulled and
all had to be equipped with powerful atoheating ap-
paratus

  these arrangements completed the problem of storing
every available inch of tonnage with condensed food
warm clothing blankets and the like was taken up
the food of some of the refugees had run low and the
manner in which the more fortunate divided their rations
and other worldly goods with the needy was indeed an
eloquent commentary on the spirit of universal brother-
hood that was dawning when the great change came

  and men found room in many a nook and corner of
their moonbound cargoes to cache the precious trinkets
of femininity and to heed the pleading voice of child-
hood  daddy please put my dolly in there

  but the supreme test did not come until the planes
were ready for the hop-off

what with the refugees who had made their way to
the peaks without the aid of atoplanes and the necessity


aimazing stories quarterly

of packing the machines with indispensables there were
not enough planes to accommodate all the survivors de-
spite the depletion of their ranks

   it was then that man was man completely severing the
ties that bound him to the silurian slime and proving
his kinship to the stars

   it was then that young and old weak and strong and
all whose passing would be a loss only to themselves
volunteered to stay behind and laugh at death that
husband and wife brother and sister and all of kindred
ties might live another day

  and the sacrifice was made without hope of reward-
was made in the rugged rockies the epic alps the de-
fiant himalayas the majestic andes and on every other
crest of the world where man had found temporary sanc-
tuary

   then came the wait for the hour they could dare risk
the airpath between the earth and moon and unless
the hour was soon their preparations would be in vain
for monstrous seas already were churning high around
the peaks and icebergs almost as vast as the mountains
themselves were wallowing in the deeps earthquakes
were increasing in intensity and frequency until the
great huls groaned in a dolorous accompaniment to
terras torturous whirl

   and the flotsam and jetsam that rode that great del-
uge was the wreckage of a world the debris of a civili-
zation whose proud homes and temples had crashed like
eggshells when the seas first smashed

chapter xiii

goodbye world

 t ets be the first to attempt the journey mil-
i dred reamer had suggested to ernest sherard
immediately he had broadcast his final message
well call your plane the pioneer the first man and
maid on the moon-wouldnt that be romantic

  yes ernest had agreed but wouldnt the last
man and maid on earth be just as thrilling however
i had decided we shall be the first if possible i shall
tell professor burke of our plans

  earths atmosphere thinned steadily the shadows on
the moon became less and less distinct and at last er-
nest decided that the airpath was strong enough came
the hour they were ready to depart their atoplane
perched on a landing under the observatory dome awaited
only the starting of the motors and the opening of the
electrically operated doors of the dome

   no fear gripped the hearts of the trio who were about
to embark on the most hazardous adventure ever under-
taken ernest sherard though strangely preoccupied
was as calm as though he were only preparing to pilot
the plane to los angeles or seattle as in the old days
mildred reamer was enthusiastic almost impatient
professor burke seemed utterly indifferent except as to
the question of whether the plane would have comfort-
able sleeping quarters an undercurrent of emotion
swayed ernest and mildred it was true but they would
have been more or less than human had they failed to
react in some degree to the seriousness of the occasion
the most momentous of their lives they were preparing
to dare the very heavens to take the chance of chances
born of the planet earth they were as truly a part of
it as the hills and the seas and their love for it was
stronger thin they had realized somewhere in their
inner minds throbbed the thought that they were com-
mitting a sacrilege in not resigning themselves to the
common fate reminiscent they were in their last hour
on the globe but the thought of the perils they were
about to face exhilarated rather than depressed them
ithe unknown lured rather than repelled they were
unafraid

jsuch sentiment stirred ernest as he stood at the ob-

servatory window and looked down at the warring waters
and the bobbing icebergs and then up at the turgid
moon

  we are like emigrants about to embark for a far
and strange land except that the emigrant is reason-
ably certain he can return to his native shore some
day he said to mildred his own country always
seems fairest to him in the parting hour and he be-
comes conscious of a desire to remain even though re-
maining means oppression to stay on this planet an-
other week would mean certain death and yet i am
loath to go-not because im afraid but because the
planets hold on me seems strongest in its darkest hour
but go we must and im glad that the next hour will
see the journey started

  and i too would like to remain were there the
slightest chance of our surviving mildred mused the
earth is more beautiful to me now than ever before
nature has always made her strongest appeal to me
when in her most violent moods i have always loved
a storm at sea and now when the whole earth is a
raging ocean its terrible grandeur seems to bid me stay
and become a part of the eerie madness but the call
of the moon is stronger my dream is about to come
true and i am eager to begin the great adventure im
sure we shall succeed how long will it take us to get
there

  probably not more than seventy hours ernest in-
formed her the moon is now about fifty-eight thou-
sand miles away the maximum speed of our plane is
two thousand miles an hour but due to the thinness of
the intervening air it will hardly be able to do better
than eight hundred miles professor burke and i shall
have to swap turns as pilot so each of us can get some
sleep for when the moons attraction becomes greater
than the earths our plane will begin to descend instead
of climb and a steady hand must be at the wheel to glide
it to the moon by starting now i believe we will reach
the sphere during its day period and that would be a
great advantage in making a successful landing

  and shall we have to remain cooped in the plane
during the long lunar nights mildred asked

  yes for a little while at least ernest answered it
is likely that within a few days the moon will have enough
atmosphere to retain a goodly part of the suns heat dur-
ing its nights but at first well have to stay in our ship
with our atoheat at maximum and our ventilation at
minimum it is probable we shall have to resort to our
oxygen tanks for the first two or three days

  those long lunar nights will fit in to perfection
put in professor burke who had just entered the room
maybe ph be able to make up for some of the sleep
ive been missing for several months im almost sorry
the moons nights arent as long as they used to be

  are you ready for the hop-off professor ernest
queried

  well i suppose one time is just as good as another
-and better he returned gloomily the moon can
be no worse than this old world and i shall shed no
maudlin tears on leaving life here is but moonshine
anyway and the moon can have no moonshine i was
beginning to hope however that you would forget and
leave me behind and that if the blamed old tail-light you
call the moon does not stop it would crash into the earth
with such a bang that it would sink all the way to hell
w-here it belongs

  whats in that package under your arm professor-
your copy of schopenhauer mildred asked hiding a
smile

  yes-some books and a goodly supply of tobacco and
other seeds he replied between puffs on his inevitable
pipe ill wager ill be the first earthian with fore-
sight in the premises and before long theyll be coming
to me on their knees to get the weed-that is if we really
the moon of doom



reach the moon and theres rain on it and tobacco will
grow up there-and if i dont misplace the darned seed
remind me of it when we reach the moon will you

  are you sure youve put everything we need in the
plane mildred asked turning to ernest

  except one of the most important things of all-a
telescope i think we can make room for the small glass
 used when my observatory was in your mothers attic
-the one you used to call the big gun ill get it now

  ten minutes later they were ready to go the big
doors of the observatory were widely ajar letting in a
rush of deadly air ernest started the puissant motors
they were off

  goodbye dear world cried mildred

  farewell mean macrocosm grunted professor
burke

chapter xiv

the aerial argosy

n-on-on to meet the moon

  it was early morning when ernest sherard and
his companions left earth-sunrise with darkness
less than six hours off

  mildred and professor burke seated in the rear of
the atoplane were afforded a wonderful view of the
world they were leaving ernest piloting could see
none of it

  looking through the small observation window mil-
dred and her quaint companion saw mie earth apparently
retreating from their ship this sensation of standing
still while ascending was not new to them however

  at a distance of twenty miles the illusion of the
planets concavity was perfect the globe seemed more
like a saucer than a bowl-an immeasurable saucer that
held a swirling mass for the movement of the waters
was still discernable here and there loomed the white
tops of mountains and icebergs the latter distinguish-
able by their motion and brilliancy flashing the primal
colors like titanic many-faceted diamonds their radi-
ance leaped high into the heavens like rainbows straight-
ened on the knees of a god and between the shifting
dazzling shafts could be seen far below the dark green
background of the rolling seas mildred was enrapt
and through the speaking tube shouted a partial de-
scription to ernest professor burke gave the spectacle
little notice i thought it would look like that was
his callous remark

  with one hundred miles behind them the earth seemed
flat and darker the play of the sunlight on the ice-
bergs was only dimly visible but scarcely less beautiful
in its subdued witchery of commingled tints

  it was at this point of the voyage that ernest sherard
gave a shout of exultation i was right he cried
we are a hundred miles from earth and the air is as
dense as when we started the moon is ours

  professor burke did not hear ernests rejoicing the
discoverer of the great change was fast asleep

  ernests calculation as to the retarded speed of the
plane proved nearly correct with the motors going
full speed the speedometer showed almost eight hundred
miles an hour

  mildred watched the vanishing dwindling planetas
long as there was a ray of light at a distance of
twenty-five hundred miles terra was seen in its natural
convexity and loomed as a huge expanse of opal and
sapphire and half an hour later in the red glory of
the sunset it was like a jewel in the ring of cosmos an
indescribably beautiful fusion of topaz and bloodstone

  then came the purple night and the planet earth was
swathed in darkness save for the faintly reflected light
of the moon which revealed it as a disk of shimmering
green and tarnished gold whose colossal bulk like a
dimly phosphorescent sea suspended in space all but
filled the picture below

  while mildred was drinking in the beauty of the
scene ernest called to her

  move forward and look at the stars he said you
cant see them well back there

  looking over his shoulder through the glass shield
the girl beheld a panorama of celestial splendor that
entranced her held her spellbound in silent ecstacy
directly before her lay the great face of the burnished
moon its pock-marked countenance more vivid than she
had ever seen it with unaided vision and on either
side and above and below stretched a wilderness of
dazzling points of light against a stygian background

  the stars she cried at last i had no idea they
would be so brilliant i thought the air which surrounds
us would dim them as on earth

  and so did i until a little while ago ernest said
cant you guess what their radiance signifies

  i dont believe i can she replied after a minutes
pondering please tell me

  it means that we are only a short distance from the
ether of space-that the air path is attenuated toward
the center as if it were traveling through a tapering
funnel as big as the earth at one end and as the moon at
the other the narrowest part will be much nearer the
moon than the earth of course because the moon is the
smaller body whether this means that the air is
denser or thinner as the tapering proceeds remains to
be seen but i believe it will be thicker and that our
speed will increase until we have passed the neck we
are now making eight hundred miles an hour

  and what if we should jut out of the unseen path
as it contracts mildred asked anxiously

  it would be the end of our adventure our ship
might fall back into the air but there would be little
time to right it and it would fall back to earth like
a plummet im afraid that that will be the fate of
many who come after us-those who will not know
that the brilliance of the stars portends danger ahead
that is why i am pointing the pioneer directly at the
center of the moon

  when is professor burke to take the wheel

  as soon as he wakes i want to be in charge when
we reach the danger zone and i must try to get some
sleep in the meantime hes still asleep i suppose
hes snoring he has missed nearly all of the beauty
-said he knew there would be billboards to mar the
scenery if he cared to look

  they resumed their star-gazing their moon-musing
look at mars mildred cried as she espied the red
planet far out in space it looks like a small moon
itself

  yes and the planets will appear much larger as we
near the walls of ether it will be a spectacle to thrill
even professor burke-if he wakes in time

  the professor is an enigma even to himself i think
mildred remarked how can one sleep in a time like
this i was never so awake so alive i feel that i shall
not be able to sleep until the moon is ours i shall
stay awake until the next darkness at least

  there wont be so much darkness after a while
ernest reminded the night that surrounds us now
is caused by the shadow of the earth and we will soon
be so far out in space that the shadow will no longer
cross our path except when the planet is directly between
us and the sun

  and we will then see the shadow as a lunar eclipse
mildred rejoiced our voyage is so wonderful that im
almost sorry it must end look at orion out there
it seems i can almost count the stars in its configura-
tion

  they journeyed on the hum of the motors becoming
louder each hour telling them that the air was becoming
stronger and to mildred the song of the motors
seemed to be

journeys end

the journey was more than half over the moon
was only twenty-five thousand miles away pro-
fessor burke had roused from his slumbers long
enough to act as pilot for eight hours and had then
resumed his nap mildred had retired to her cabin for
her first sleep ince leaving earth ernest sherard
certain that they were nearing the point of greatest
danger was pointing the pioneer directly at the small
crater of reaumur a central cavity on the satellites
pitted face he was to call mildred when they neared
the narrowest part of the unseen road the boundaries
of which would be only a few miles away so that she
might see the stars and planets at their brightest and
the glory of the suns corona

  professor burke had failed to show any mark of
feeling while viewing the stars from the cockpit but
had he been lifted to the seventh heaven of ecstacy
he would not have admitted it he regarded a display
of the emotions-the militant urge excepted-as an adver-
tisement of tempermental instability just as he con-
sidered it a sign of mental weakness to fully agree with
anyone he conceded however that the panorama was
of transcendent beauty but contended that he couldnt
see anything wonderful about it we expected it to
look like that you know he told mildred we know
the cause and it would be wonderful only if the cause
failed to produce the effect

  when ernest resumed command the plane was making
a thousand miles an hour within three hours the indi-
cator was pushing fourteen hundred it was then ernest
called to mildred

  we are nearing the crucial stage he informed the
air is nearly as dense as it used to be on earth and i
believe it will be even denser at the narrowest point in
which event our ship will exceed any speed it has ever
attained

  how far are we from the moon

  hardly more than twenty-four thousand miles
twenty-four more hours should see our journey ended
as i believe we will average about a thousand miles an
hour the rest of the way we will probably average
twenty-five hundred when we are in the neck of the
air and more than a thousand for several more hours
and then when the air is again so rarefied that our
speed is materially diminished we will probably have
reached a point where the moons attraction is greater
than the earths this will necessitate retarding our
plane-like applying the brakes of an automobile in
going down hill we will then have to spiral down to the
moon

  why that means we must spiral for thousands of
miles does it not

  yes eight or nine thousand i should say i calcu-
late we will be that close to the moon when the gravita-
tional change occurs luna we must remember also
has been advancing to meet us though her speed has been
reduced greatly since we left earth the two spheres
then were separated by approximately fifty-eight thou-
sand miles we have come not more than twenty-nine
thousand but the moon despite its slowing down has
advanced about five thousand during that time this
brings us within twenty-four thousand miles and the
next hour or so should find us entering the belt of
thickest air

  i think we must be entering it now mildred said
the planets are almost as bright as small suns and im
certain i can see a faint glow of the solar corona i am
going back to look at the earth again and ill wake

professor burke so we may see the flaming sun together
i suppose hell growl at being roused but ive heard him
say many times that he would like to be where he could
see the corona without waiting for an eclipse i have
no hope that the spectacle will come up to his expecta-
tions however hes certain to find something wrong
with it

  it was neither night nor day twenty-four thousand
miles out in space a ghostly twilight unlike any the
earthians had ever seen filled the airpath-a twilight
that hinted of green mildred had first noticed the
strange dusk several thousand miles back and had called
ernests attention to it and he had told her that she
would probably discover the cause the next time she
looked through the rear observation window

  one glance through the glass solved the mystery for
mildred eureka she exclaimed her voice exulting
through the speaking tube its the earthlight ernest
our world is now a great ball of shimmering green its
radiance seems phosphorescent all of the globe is vis-
ible but i think i see the shadow of night beginning to
encroach on one side of it-the eastern side i was
about to say but ive lost all sense of direction up here
if the earth were not covered with ice and water im
sure i could see the continents in bas-relief i wish you
could see it ernest it is more beautiful than i ever
dreamed it could be

  well that confirms the popular scientific theory as
to the planetary color of terra ernest responded
personally however i believed its luminosity viewed
from afar could have been blue as well as green pro-
fessor burke always insisted earth was a yellow planet
i wonder what hell say about it now

  he has already said it mildred laughed i found
him earth-gazing when i came to wake him and hia
only remark was that he had just made the astounding
discovery that the earth not the moon was made of
green cheese

  yes and i still contend its yellow if viewed from
a sufficient distance burkes voice triumphed behind
them disprove that if you can and i also claim
that pretty moon of yours is likely to turn on its axis
before long though i dont think ernest has mentioned
that phase of the situation

  mildred continued to watch the globe until the black
fringe had climbed over its edge and blotted out a fourth
of it it was then that she saw for the first time a
gibbous earth so rapidly was the planet revolving she
could see the movement of the shadow across its face
she told ernest of this and the young lunarians guess
was that the world was revolving in slightly less than
five hours

  and its certain the waves have conquered everything
but the highest peaks he added i wonder if there is
a spark of life left the temperature must be almost
as low as up here let us hope that every atoplane has
already left the planet some of them may be only a few
thousand miles behind us

  how cold is it outside mildred asked

  about ninety below zero the propeller blades are
glazed with two inches of ice it was a hundred below
a few minutes ago and the rise is proof that the air is
getting much denser our ship is now making the un-
precedented speed of twenty-three hundred miles an
hour and i guess this means we are near the outer
nothingness come and look at the sun now mildred
and bring the professor with you

  the next hour was to them the climax of eternity
itself the one hour into which was crowded all the
beauty and splendor spun of creations warp and woof
   the pristine glory of the universe resplendent in an
infinitude of ether    beauty inconceivable ineffable
   beauty so exquisite that it sang of pain    beauty
that subdued demanding silence    celestial splendor
the moon of doom



not meant for mortal eyes    splendor that dazzled
blinded only to give new sight    the sun with
its red robes of flame fluttering five hundred thou-
sand miles in space    the swing of pleiades   
orions neluhous lustre    saturn ringed and many-
mooned    blue venus fairest daughter of the sun   
bed mars big as a bloody moon   the prodigious moon
itself    and back of all the erebus of unreverberate
space

  after many minutes ernests voice broke the preg-
nant silence

  its a pity we wont be able to see this sublimity from
the moon he said its newly acquired atmosphere
will dim the stars and hide the corona we may be
seeing their real glory for the last time for the air
path is already widening and by the way-wed better
prepare for the gravitational change well feel as
light as birds when we come under the moons influence

  two hours later they were beyond the narrow pale
the gorgeous extravaganza of the heavens fading behind
them their aerial argosys speed had diminished to
seventeen hundred miles an hour before them less
than twenty thousand miles lay the mystic mountains of
the moon

  it was full daylight  luna but the brightness was
steadily giving way to a monochrome of gray this
seeming paradox ernest explained was due to the moons
borrowed brilliance disappearing as its natural dullness
hove into view

  the mountains were only faintly discernible in the
gray blur and the craters had vanished entirely er-
nest foresaw little danger on this score however as
the airpath was now several hundred miles wide per-
mitting greater latitude in guiding the plane the
crater of reaumur and other moonmarks would re-
appear he knew when near enough to be distinguished
without the aid of the lost light

  as they were studying the lunar dimness another
transition occurred a sable circle began to edge its
way over the great ashen ball turning it into a globe of
ebony it was the shadow of terra they had seen
many eclipses since the great change but none so spec-
tacular so bizarre as this they watched it until the
moon was entirely darkened and then until the black-
ness moved on into space leaving luna to her weird
wan sombreness

  came the hour when the pull of the moon was stronger
than that of the earth the physical effects of the change
were not so marked as they had anticipated they first
became aware that they were descending instead of
climbing when they were about nine thousand miles from
their destination and the earth was some forty-five
thousand miles above them in a little while the pioneer
was descending in vast but ever-narrowing circles

  and then with only three thousand miles to go they
could see the mountain ranges in bold relief while the
craters appeared as shell-holes on some ancient battle-
field of earth the moon was now the color of gray
weathered sandstone

  down they went until the darkest parts of the satel-
lite assumed the color of slate the gliding process was
becoming complicated because of the moons weak tug
and ernest had to keep the motors in operation most
of the time down until they were below the level of
the higher peaks down until the crevices and craters
yawned in their very faces

  amid a cloud of lunar dust they landed on a level
stretch about a mile from reaumur

chapter xvi
the pit of reaumur

their epochal journey ended there remained the
possibility that it had been made in vain

the pioneers altimeter told them that the moons

atmosphere was as dense as that which they had left on
earth and the thermometer revealed that the tempera-
ture was twenty degrees above zero but whether or not
the long lunar nights would bring the cold of death was
a question that the darkness only could answer

  accomplishers of the most perilous feat mortals ever
attempted they felt the surge of fear now that the
voyage was over-the fear of the unknown that was the
heritage of life itself the stretch of moonland around
them grotesque and uninviting seemed to whisper mys-
teries dark as the apennines that loomed on the far
horizon reason told them there was nothing to fear
but imagination hinted of forces subtle and sinister
they found it difficult to believe they were actually on
the moon the great change the flight through space
and the very moon itself now seemed a fantastic dream

  not a word was uttered for several minutes pro-
fessor burkes piping voice was the first to pierce the
lunar silence

  lets get out of here he suggested i feel as though
i had been living in one of those ancient new york
apartment houses i want to see what is inside that
small crater over there

  and who shall be the first earthian to set foot on
the moon ernest queried if the professor doesnt
care i move that mildred be given that honor

  sure burke acquiesced id probably decline the
distinction even if mildred were not here for it strikes
me that one time to turn the trick is just as good as
another if not better in view of the fact that the world
will never know of it

  but thats not fair mildred objected ernest has
given nearly his whole life to lunar study and it was
his knowledge and initiative that brought us here i
insist that he have the honor

  as a compromise she and ernest stepped from the
plane together touching the soil simultaneously

  the first man and maid on the moon mildred
jubilated my dream has come true at last

  at last ernest echoed it was my dream too
you know

  and i wonder if we arent dreaming still mildred
marvelled i feel almost ethereal since i stepped from
the plane it seems i could really fly if i tried of
course i know why and it means we must learn to walk
anew we are no more than moon babies now

  yes ernest said we must learn all over the
moons gravity is only one-sixth that of the earth and
well be almost helpless at first we didnt feel the
change so much before we landed because the ship was
in motion moon babies is right suppose we start
now hold my hand and well venture a short step-just
a few inches here we go

  despite their caution their first stride carried them
two yards and they would have fallen head-first but for
the feebleness of the moons pull which enabled them
to regain their equilibrium

  their next attempt proved more successful though it
was more a leap than a step their third effort was
even more encouraging and they were certain they could
soon adjust their locomotion to lunar requirements

  wait there ill show you how to ambulate on this
deceptive surface

  professor burke had stepped from the plane they
turned to see him crouched for a leap

  say what are you going to do ernest called

  im going to jump to that small crater over there
thats the way to travel here a healthy jump will carry
me at least seven yards

  look out

  the warning came too late the pudgy professor
was already in the air his leap carried him fully ten
feet high and he turned a complete somersault in mid-


amazing stories quarterly

air and fell in a heap twenty feet from its starting
point half buried in the powdery soil

  first mistake ive made this year he said dryly
getting up and shaking the dust from his clothes my
reckoning didnt include such an ascension you must
admit however that the first half of my jump was a
great success

  in a few minutes he had partly mastered the short-
step gait his companions were employing and was amb-
ling toward the crater some fifty yards away the pit
was no more than a shell-hole with walls about four feet
high

  ernest and mildred awaited his return they saw
him reach the cavity after a hard struggle peer into it
and shake his head negatively

  well what was inside ernest asked upon his return

  just as i thought-nothing but the inside and not
much of that

  that crater is no more than a stump-hole compared
with some of the moons pockmarks ernest reminded
i imagine that reaumur over yonder will prove a more
fruitful object of study its only a mile so i suggest
we walk over and investigate

  why walk professor burke asked sharply the
plane would get us there in a jiffy

  yes but i think the walk will do us good we need
some exercise after our long confinement

  well suit yourselves ill stay here till you return
i want to examine this soil and see if it will grow
tobacco the stuff looks as if it contains silver

  ernest smiled i think the professor sadly mistrusts
his underpinning he whispered to mildred as they be-
gan their hike

  but the lunar soil was indeed a substance worthy of
scientific study it was like no soil they had known on
earth the color of salt and even more finely grained
it seemed to be a mixture of disintegrated rock pul-
verized marble and silica it glittered in the sunlight
and gave under foot like dry snow

  its latter quality hinting of quicksand tended to abet
the effect of the moons puny gravitation and ernest
and mildred soon learned that walking was a more com-
plicated matter than their first brief efforts had indicated
they found it necessary to hold hands most of the way
and their tedious journey consumed the better part of
an hour

  but the reward was worth the effort upon nearing
the ramparts of reaumur which rose about four hundred
feet they made the first surprising discovery of their
lunar exploration

  the mysterious white rays they had seen through the
telescope were explained

  leading into the pit of reaumur from every direction
like spokes into a hub the rays were nothing less than
deep ditches waterways dug by the moonmen of long
ago their purpose was obvious they had been made
to hoard the rainfall of a drying world by carrying it
into the natural reservoirs of the craters through small
openings bored through the walls the greater length
of the channels was covered with the strange sand but
enough was visible at the base of reaumurs ramparts
to tell their history and when ernest using his hands
as a shovel removed some of the sand from the bottom
of one of the ditches at a point some distance from the
crater he learned why the trenches around the larger
pits had appeared white through the telescope the
lower walls and bottoms were lined with a material that
resembled highly polished marble

  the openings in the sides of the crater were too small
and the ramparts too high to permit exploration of the
interior

  probably every sizable crater tells the same story-
the story of a dying race ernest remarked as he and
mildred turned to go there was a touch of sadness in

his voice it must have taken the moonmen many
years-centuries perhaps-to convert the craters into
cisterns the martians science believes once engaged
in a similar work-digging canals

  but why is it mildred asked that the channels of
the principal craters are white for miles while those of
reaumur are almost hidden by sand

  the only supposition is that the craters of tycho
copernicus and kepler whose rays are most pronounced
are in regions comparatively free of this substance we
have called sand this must be particularly true of
kepler which is located on one of the dark plains which
the early astronomers called seas i believe we will
learn much more when we visit the larger pits where
the waterways through the walls may be large enough
for us to go through and view the interior reaumur is
one of the minor craters-not more than ten miles in
diameter

  which region do you intend to explore first

  you should have guessed that-mount hadley of
course it is possible that we can decipher the hiero-
glyphics and learn more than we could by years of
exploration

  beginning their trek back to the plane they saw pro-
fessor burke a pygmy in the distance walking in a
narrow circle and flapping his arms for balance like
a penguin

  the professor will probably tell us that he has reached
the astounding conclusion that snowshoes would facili-
tate our peripatetic progress ernest predicated

  and ill agree with him mildred laughed

  but the professors greeting contained not a perambu-
latory word

  i have discovered that this sand is exactly the color
of dirty salt he said and i dont believe it would grow
even cactus

chapter xvii

mount hadley

hall we start now or get some sleep first
ernest asked iter telling professor burke of his
plan to visit mount hadley as for me i pro-
pose some food and then a little slumber

  and as for me i refuse to budge until you have slept
a while mildred declared you havent slept six hours
since we left earth and ill admit im quite sleepy
myself

  well it seems the motion is carried professor
burke yawned i was hoping we would not be slaves to
slumber on the moon that its hold would be weakened
like its law of gravitation but it appears that morpheus
is also one of the lunar gods put us on the farthest star
and wed be earthbound still therefore let us sleep
ernest also yawned i guess i am about all in but
me mustnt lose much time in sleep just now the lunar
night will begin in less than twenty hours and i want to
see mount hadley first seven or eight hours sleep
should put me back in trim

  and how long will the darkness last mildred
queried

  without figuring it out about thirty hours i should
say that will give us plenty of time to make up for
lost slumber

  and thank goodness there are no alarm clocks on the
moon-and no blamed roosters professor burke com-
mented im not sleepy though

  after partaking of some concentrated food they re-
tired to their respective bunks and were soon wrapped
in oblivion

  ernest was the first to wake some eight hours later
stentorian snores from the direction of professor
burkes compartment told him that his somnolent com-
panion was still dormant
the moon of doom



  pushing the button of the wire that led to mildreds
room ernest heard her cheery all right ring out with
the first tinkle of the tiny bell a few minutes later
she joined him lilting caro nome

  happy ernest asked

  as though we were back on earth attending an opera
or watching a storm i suppose there will be no storms
on the moon imagine how wonderful it would be to see
thunderclouds fighting the peaks of the apennines
yes it would be inspiring we may not see any
storm clouds here but there will not be an entire absence
of thunder so long as professor burke persists in sleep-
ing with his mouth open i must go and wake him now
for mount hadley is calling us no use to ring the
bell-guess ill have to pull him out of bed

  ive been awake an hour the girl heard the pro-
fessor remonstrate at ernests chiding

  half an hour later they had breakfasted on condensed
food and coffee heated on the planes atoheaters and were
ready to take off on their first intralunar flight

  well what do you know about that ernest ejacu-
lated when the big metal bird failed to lift at the first
throbs of the motors were stalled

  you mean youre stalled professor burke chortled
triumphantly the propellers are not used to this lunar
air speed up the motors and we will rise

  i had thought of that ernest laughed but it must
be the same air we had on earth and it seems dense
enough i rather think the trouble lies below-that the
plane is wheel-deep in sand lets see

  he stopped the motors and climbed out

  i was right professor he called back a minute
later the ship is all but resting on its hull the
lunar soil is little more than quicksand

  just as i thought professor burke muttered reach-
ing for his pipe as ernest returned to the cockpit

  to the full tug of the powerful motors the pioneer
rose from its tenacious bed after the helicopter had
lifted it about five hundred feet ernest turned it round
and leveled it at the distant apennines

  how far are the mountains mildred asked

  not more than five hundred miles we could make
it in a few minutes but i think ill travel leisurely so
we may study the moons terrain

  the moons terrain the moons terrain profes-
sor burke fairly convulsed with laughter i always
thought terrain was rather peculiar to terra

  the moons topography or the moonscape if you
prefer ernest laughed back mildred joining in the
mirth

  vast stretches of the strange gray sand punctured
here and there by small craters was all they saw for the
first three hundred miles the land then became more
rugged the plain giving way to small hills sprinkled with
grotesque boulders

  ernest suddenly tilted the pioneer upward carried it
to eighteen thousand feet and then swerved it to the
left in the direction of a great circular formation that
was coming into view

  the crater of eratosthenes i think he told his
companions im not certain but well fly over it and
see

  the jagged walls of the fantastic ring-plain seemed
to be coming to meet them in one place the ramparts
rose more than sixteen thousand feet

  they were soon over the vast enclosure

  it is eratosthenes ernest said its about forty
miles in diameter see that great mound in the middle
of the bowl thats the massive central complex moun-
tain which seen from earth sometimes looked like a
crater ring eratosthenes is one of the moons finest
ring-plains but copernicus just to the east of the apen-
nines is larger eratosthenes is at the eastern terminus

of the range while mount hadley is at the northern
extremity

  the apennines became visible before they had crossed
the crater the sullen mass of the great chain seemed
interminable ernest kept the plane at eighteen thou-
sand feet and turned it in the direction of mount had-
ley

  the pioneer moved slowly over the weird expanse of
lavatic ridges some of the peaks rose like needle-points
and between them far below yawned deep distorted
canyons and sinuous ravines so terrible was the grand-
eur of the apennines that the earthians found it hard
to realize they were not in a ghostly dream

  at length they were over the northern border of the
range and ernest pointed out a great peak which he took
to be mount hadley but no hieroglyphics were visible

  the writing may be on the other side he ventured
as he nosed the plane downward in ever-widening spirals
to the base of the  foot mountain

  professor burkes thick horn-rimmcd spectacles
which he always insisted he did not really need fur-
nished first discovery

  look he cried when they were half down the cliff
look his voice rang with alien excitement

  where his companions exclaimed in breathless uni-
son

  down there-behind us vainly he panted and
pointed his companions saw nothing but blank rock

  now weve lost them professor burke wailed
cant see them again until the next roundtrip theyre
a thousand feet high

  ernest made the next spiral in nasty speed

  there-i see them mildred exclaimed as the other
side of the mountain again came into view look
ernest

  the pioneer was about five thousand feet high below
beginning about two thousand feet from the base was
mount hadleys flat face-a slate-colored wall so nearly
smooth and straight that it seemed the work of some deft
blade immeasurably titanic and on the vast escarp-
ment inlaid with whitish stone was the handiwork of
the moonmen

  still farther below at the very foot of the cliff and
between hadley and the next high mountain stretched
a level expanse several miles wide

  on this plain the pioneer landed

chapter xviii
the thing

ut t cant be done but ill do it was the contradic-
 tory declaration of professor burke in the role
of hieroglyphist after he had studied the charac-
ters on mount hadley for several hours

  landing about a mile from the base of the mountain
their first act had been to walk to the pictured cliff for
a closer scrutiny only to discover that the gigantic size
of the symbols precluded study at close range and an-
other thing they discovered the characters with the
exception of the most imposing figure a gargantuan
something made of a cement-like material were of the
whitest marble inlaid deeply and dexterously in the
slaty wall

  they were now back at the plane having found it a
point of vantage for viewing the enigmatic panorama
with the aid of their binoculars

  compelling as the lure of lost atlantis baffling as the
quiz of theban sphinx fantastic as the wildest hashish
dream was the scene that held their interest

  two thousand feet the tablet towered one thousand
feet it stretched a central figure of an uncouth thing-
was it male or female god or devil before it kneeling
votaries almost as weirdly formed above it and on

either side long lines of lunar lore below it titan fi-
gures telling mathematic art

  the central figure-the thing-was fully three hun-
dred feet high despite its sitting posture modeled in
bold relief it seemed a nightmare something turned to
stone though its features were plainly delineated there
was a suggestion of shapelessness throughout it might
have been an evil genie from aladdins mystic lamp or a
shape from the nethermost pit its head-if head it
might be called-was larger than its body by far the
most conspicuous feature was its eyes-great protruding
radiant balls set high on a bulging brow and topped by
what seemed to be spreading antennae the orbs were
at least fifteen feet in diameter were faceted and
sparkled like a thousand diamonds its nose was a
stubby porcine snout its mouth an inordinate many-
fanged flabby-lipped gash reaching almost from ear to
ear and twisted in a gargoyle grin half smile half leer
its ears were huge fantastic appendages extending from
the jowl below the level of the nose-tip the lower part
of the head like the upper was turgid giving it the
contour of the figure  of a plump peanut rather there
was no neck

  the things body was bulbous and striped like a
monstrous onion two massive triple-jointed arms re-
sembling in structure the anterior legs of an insect
protruded from each shoulder the lower pair being
folded across its pot belly while the other two extended
in front of the body clutched a colossal block of stone
which was suspended menacingly over a huge bowl held
in the lap the two objects forming a sort of mortar and
pestle arrangement the bowl was gripped between the
monstrositys stump legs which corresponded in number
with its arms and were likewise triple-jointed but what
attracted the earthians most next to the fetishs blaz-
ing eyes were its hands and feet which though scaly
were human in every other respect even to the nails

  the thing was naked sexless

  in striking contrast to the monsters uncouth pro-
portions and terrible aspect but scarcely less bizarre
were the figures of its worshippers the kneeling moon-
men some of whose faces were turned from the god were
half insect half human their heads prodigious and
almost perfectly oval were balanced on long and ab-
surdly small necks their eyes mere specks under
beetling brows and like the idols were surmounted by
antennae their noses were short and flat with enor-
mous nostrils their ears disproportionately large
might have been huge copies of cockleshells and were
radially ribbed inside and notched on the rims their
mouths were quite small and rather puckered but not
uncomely all told their faces while amazingly grotes-
que were not forbidding

  the bodies of the moonmen also were egg-shaped but
more tapering than their heads the circumference of
their chests must have been thrice that of their wasp-
like waists from which suspended short leather-like gar-
ments of arms and legs there were only two of each
but they like the idols were triple-jointed and exceed-
ingly long and slender ending like the gods in hands and
feet of human shape though formed of cement like the
idol there was a suggestion of fragility of pulpiness
almost about the figures to quote professor burke
the moonmen looked like abominable insects lugging
twin maypops around

  there were other moon people men and women fash-
ioned on the cliff and several kinds of animals but noth-
ing to denote the life size of either-and if there had
been the comparisons would have been meaningless to
the earthians on either side of the idol some distance
away stood groups of erect moonmen some of them en-

 	this is the edible fruit of a passion flower of the southern u s
 resembling a yellow apple but is without much flavor

cased in armor and armed with spears and clubs-the
lunar legions no doubt the soldiers also wore helmets
strangely like those of terras ancient knights barring
the holes through which antennae protruded other fig-
ures-presumably female-wore umbrella-shaped head-
gear and carried baskets and urns a few naked chil-
dren were represented

  the animals-if animals they were-were even more
insect-like than the lunarians though varying in size
and structure the bodies of all were oval and tail-less
their heads mere knobs professor burke said they
looked like fat sausages with knots on one end some of
the beasts were quadrupeds others hexapods among
the six-legged were some gigantic things formed like
fleas except that their bodies were not laterally com-
pressed some of them were hitched to clumsy two-
wheeled chariots and carts there also were some
bloated creatures with udders and teats some small
quadrupeds held in leash like dogs and several other
shapes that could be likened to nothing the earthians
had seen on their globe

  hundreds of lunar objects also were represented
there were pictures of mountains craters caves of
houses that resembled adobe structures and one of an
imposing many-windowed building that must have been
a temple a series of horizontal wavy lines was taken
by the earthians to represent water and an arch sur-
mounting perpendicular wavy streaks looked like a rain
picture drawn by a prehistoric artist of the mother
planet and there was the likeness of the mother world
itself-two circles in which the outlines of earths con-
tinents had been carved the hemispheres were not
readily distinguishable however the eastern con-
tinents were not quite in keeping with those known to
the earthians the western hemisphere showed that
north america was joined to asia by a narrow neck of
land and between the americas and europe nearer the
latter continent and embraced in the circle showing the
western half of the globe lay a vast body of land which
the earthians had never seen but which they knew to
be atlantis the outlines of nearly all the continents
were slightly different from those with which they were
familiar it was clear that great geologic changes had
taken place since the maps were drawn for instance
the lunarians had the continent of asia extending clear
to borneo and including the philippine islands-and
there was the wallace line between asia and aus-
tralia

  hieroglyphics stretched in every direction line on
line some of them were carved above the idol and on
both sides of the erect moonmen and on the sides of the
chariots and carts many of the characters were more
than a hundred feet high others particularly those on
the vehicles relatively small

  the arithmetical arrangements near the base of the
mountain were easily comprehensible their simplicity
seemed striking proof that the lunarians knew earth
was inhabited and had tried to make their meaning in-
telligible to the planetarians first there was a long
straight mark a dash and then another mark followed
by a symbol for the figure  this system continued
through the figure  each total being accompanied by
its symbol then advanced into octuplication and later
into mathematical characters that the earthians could
not decipher

  the carvings naturally interested ernest and mildred
more than anything they had seen since reaching the
satellite ernest now knew why he had been unable to
see the great idol from earth its cement composition
was almost as dark as its slaty background he be-
lieved however that he should have seen its flashing

   	an imaginary line separating the oriental and australian regions
it passes between bali and lombok between celebes and borneo and to
the eastward of the philippines recent authors contend that it should paa

are remarkably distinct
the moon of doom



two thousand feet the tablet towered ono thousand feet it stretched a contra figure of on uncouth thing-was it male or female god
or dovil beforo it kneeling votaries almost as weirdly formed above it and on oithor side long lines of lunar lore below it titan

figures telling mathcmatic art

eyes mildred paid little attention to the hieroglyphics
leaving their deciphering to professor burke the
hideousness of the god fascinated her and she declared
that the fetishs eyes were hypnotic and as for pro-
fessor burke he literally lost himself in trying to de-
cipher the hieroglyphics between energetic pipe puffs he
would occasionally emit an enigmatic tantalizing ah
and then relapse into silence his eyes taking on the ab-
stracted squint of puzzlement

  well what do you make of them professor er-
nest finally dared to interrupt his companions brown
study

  it was then that professor burke had said it couldnt
be done but hed do it adding that the moonmen prob-
ably left a sort of rosetta stone somewhere but it would
be useless to look for it as it would contain nothing but
equally perplexing writings

  waxing poetic over the god and the other grotesque
figures he had quoted poe

they are neither man nor woman-

they are neither brute nor human-

they are ghouls

nine hours had passed since their coming to mount
hadley already the chill that heralded the lunar
night was in the air

  only a few more hours of light and then the long
sleep ernest remarked

  no long sleep for me professor burke asseverated
i purpose to put every one of those blamed figures on
paper and stay up until the next sun if necessary to
decipher them

  suit yourself ernest smiled but mildred and i
are going to call it a day between making another trip
to the base of the mountain we want to make a closer
study of the idols eyes-and maybe well find that
rosetta stone

  they returned two hours later to find professor burke
still sedulously engaged in transcribing the characters
he greeted them with an interrogatory grunt

  we didnt find miss rosetta ernest announced
but we did discover that the idols eyes are made of
hundreds of diamonds or other stones just as brilliant
some of them as large as a mans hand and we made
another discovery too

  piflle professor burke piped

  its the truth mildred affirmed

  oh im not skeptical on that score he modified
but what good are diamonds here even if they were as
big as the idol itself what was the other discovery
ernest

  that there is a cave just to the left of the pictured
cliff large enough to house our plane we will spend
the night there partly protected from the cold the
atoheaters would keep us comfortable of course but i


amazing stories quarterly

dont fancy the idea of camping out here on the plain
three more hours and then came the lunar dusk
the temperature had tumbled below zero professor
burke had completed his transcription

  look mildred exclaimed excitedly as ernest was
preparing to start the plane for the short trip to the
cave

  a ball of greenish gold so vast that it embraced
nearly half of the lunar horizon was climbing above the
serrate mountains it was mother earth rising to keep
nocturnal vigil over her cold dead daughter-mother
earth glorious in her own travail

  the planet glowed like a solid sheen of emerald dif-
fused with topaz tint and bathed the satellite in eld-
ritch twilight

  oh god how beautiful mildred ecstasied she
stretched her hands toward the luminous world

  ernest recalled that her cry of joy was the same she
had uttered when as a child she first looked through
the big gun at jupiter and his family of moons

  and how beautiful you are he heard himself whis-
pering i sometimes think that the very gods that
made you must wonder at your loveliness

   the girl still enrapt did not hear

       chapter xix
       the air speaks

nybody there anybody there well ill be
double damned

  professor burkes colorful explosion woke his
companions at the first crack of lunar dawn they had
divided the night into four periods spending much of
their daytime in reading and each time they had
roused or retired professor burke was still poring over
the figures copied from the cliff

  whats the matter ernest called from his bunk
the matter the professor was plainly agitated
matter enough weve been dreaming thats all were
still on earth id just fallen asleep after working nearly
a million hours on those infernal hieroglyphics when the
radio-but wait youll hear it yourself in a moment
hear what mildreds voice rang out

  as if in answer to her query a strident cock-a-doodle-
doo came from the tubes

  shrill chanticleer pierces the dull ear of morn
professor burke quoted dramatically what did i tell
you blamed thing started crowing about ten minutes
ago-loud enough to wake the dead ive shouted hello

until im hoarse but the only reply is-

  cock-a-doodle-doo the radio aptly inserted

  as poe would say only that and nothing more  the
professor finished

  maybe its a dream and were dreaming were back
on earth mildred suggested her face framed in the
curtains of her berth

  ive got the answer ernest flashed after a stupefied
moment another plane has landed on the moon weve
been here quite a while you know and i wouldnt be sur-
prised if a flock of them had arrived

  just as i supposed the professor muttered of
course thats it

  but why doesnt it answer ernest continued
surely a cock is not its sole occupant try to get them
again professor ill be with you directly

  professor burke again turned to the radio this
is professor burke-francis burke-speaking he

boomed hail fellow earthians greetings i-

  cock-a-doodle-doo

  dammit i say the professor snapped and he sat
down

  ernest joined him a moment later followed by mil-
dred who was quivering with excitement

  no wonder ernest ejaculated after a hasty inspec-

tion of the radio the microphone is disconnected
professor burke slumped into his chair and groaned
ernest quickly adjusted the mechanism and shouted
a hello

  silence

  hello hello 

  and then after a louder shout the radio spoke
daddy daddy a childish voice came through the
air wake up daddy someone is calling us

  a moment later a masculine hello was heard
ernest responded his companions pressing close to
the amplifier

  this is professor ernest sherard of mount shasta
observatory he enunciated my companions are pro-
fessor burke of burke observatory and mildred reamer
my assistant we believe we were the first to reach the
moon we are now in our plane in a cave under mount
hadley on the pictured side of the cliff

  this is dr elmo harveston of maidstone england
and my little daughter thomasine the voice returned
of course i have heard of you and of professor burke
and understood you were the first to leave the earth we
reached the moon early last night-that is about twenty-
five hours ago we landed on a plateau near a high
mountain range-the rook chain i think at least three
other planes are here i signaled them shortly after
i arrived one of them-wait a moment please until
thomasine carries her pet rooster into another com-
partment-hes crowing his head off-one of them was
piloted by an american named hogrefe from detroit
brought his family and several relatives a german
named eckhoff also is here but i know very little ger-
man and couldnt talk with him the third ship brought
antoine lataste a young french engineer and several
children refugees he picked up in the pyrenees the
planes are widely scattered the american landed on
a plain near a large crater the german mentioned
bergen so i guess hes somewhere in the mountains
the frenchman says he is near a great ditch nearly a
hundred miles long-the alpine valley no doubt but i
suppose you have already heard from them and from
others perhaps

  no ernest told him we have been so busy studying
the inscriptions on mount hadley that we completely
forgot the radio until your rooster woke professor burke
a few minutes ago i suppose you were operating on a
different wave length last night or we would have heard
your signals perhaps a dozen or more planes are here
by this time

  harveston expressed great interest in the hierogly-
phics and ernest furnished a brief description also tell-
ing him of the moon fetish

  the conversation then turned to their respective
voyages to the moon and harveston said he had come so
dangerously near the walls of space that his plane had all
but tail-spinned before he grasped the situation

  i fear hundreds of ships will perish in the ether
sea ernest commented gravely but there was no way
of foretelling the danger

  what are your immediate plans harveston asked
we shall leave the cave as soon as the temperature
permits it is hardly daybreak yet and we dare not ven-
ture out of the plane until the sun is up a few hours
professor burke tells me he wishes to take one more
look at the hieroglyphics to verify some of his transcrip-
tions he worked on them nearly the whole night
through and thinks the solution is in sight have you a
map of the moon

  yes

  well our next stop will be the great crater of tycho
i think an investigation of its white rays will prove
most interesting in view of what we have already found
at one of the smaller pits suppose you meet us there-
in about six hours say-and together we will signal at
the moon of doom

nr



various wave lengths to learn how many other planes
have arrived i dont think you will have much trouble
locating the crater because of the prominence of its
rays and youre much nearer it than we are

   it was agreed and they signed off

  well old comrade ernest turned to professor
burke i suppose youll be wanting to get a little more
sleep while were waiting on the sun

   yes i might as well as theres nothing else to do
until i can check up on those inscriptions but im not
at all sleepy there are some mortals who laugh at
morpheus you know it was said of napoleon and edi-
son that they often went a week or more without sleep
they also were great men i-he tried in vain to sup-
press a yawn-well as i said theres nothing to do un-
til i can verify my copies think i missed a whole row
of symbols dont let me sleep too long

  wait just a minute before you retire professor i
think ill run the plane to the mouth of the cave so
that mildred and i may watch the sunrise

  five minutes later the move had been made and er-
nest and mildred were watching in entranced silence
the indescribable glory of the lunar dawn professor
burke was snoring rapturously

  look ernest cried suddenly breaking the spell
he pointed skyward

   high over the plain its wings gleaming in the suns
first rays a huge shape was pictured against the sky

  its an atoliner mildred exclaimed its coming
this way lets see if we can signal it	-

  no ernest demurred the radio might wake pro-
fessor burke well get them later

   they watched the great metal bird until it passed over
them and was blotted out by the apennines

chapter xx

the crescent city

the crescent city one of americas biggest ato-
liners was flying low and leisurely over the lunar
plains the apennines were five hundred miles be-
hind a tall well-poised man of about thirty-five whose
white cap bore the insignia of captain sat in the cockpit
with the pilot and studied the lunar landscape through
his binoculars his dark eyes were boyish adventurous
but his aquiline nose firm mouth and square-set jaw
bespoke resourcefulness and resolve

  he presently lowered his glasses and addressed the
pilot a little to the left martin-thats about right
straight ahead now i dont like the look of that sand
down there its worse than sahara i think theres
firmer ground a few miles ahead-its darker anyway
then into the transmitter that carried his voice to
every cabin we will land in a few minutes but may
have to stay in the ship several hours theres plenty
of air but it will be too cold outside until the sun is up
a while

   immediately the atoliner became a babel of excitement
the passengers most of whom had been viewing the
scene from their cabin windows rushed pell-mell into the
aisles and surged toward the doors their voices a discord
of agitation and rejoicing the long journey was over
they were safe the moon was theirs the rays of
the early sun beckoned and they were eager to heed the
call

   ten minutes later the captain spoke again and at his
words the craft nosed into a long graceful glide

   the crescent city came to rest ten miles from the sea
of sand on an ashen plain whose smooth slaty surface
stretched interminably onward

   once more the passengers surged toward the doors tut
stopped abruptly the gravitational change felt only
slightly while the plane was in motion now rendered them
helpless ridiculous

  the captain faced them stopped their irush with a
word well have to learn to walk agaii he said as
solemnly as possible we must stay it the ship for
three or four hours the thermometer shpws it is eighty
below zero outside in the meantime tye will try to as-
certain if any voyagers have preceded us

   he led the wobbling floundering earthians to the radio
room and seated himself before the microphone the
passengers gathered round and waited with bated breath
as he turned the dial and shouted hello with each
movement

   presently they were rewarded a clear hello  came
back the salutation sounded eerie impossible like a
voice that had followed them through spare

   this is captain sewell ellington of pre crescent city
new orleans the man at the nrfcrophotfe shouted we
have just arrived-seventy-five of
welcome to the moon the voicerfesponded cheerfully
this is dr elmo harveston op maidstone england
made the trip with my little daughter in a small plane
arrived about forty-five hours ao where are you
wish we knew havent had time to get our bearings
afraid the ship would founder in the sand so we kept
going until we reached an expanse of rock thats as
smooth as a floor its oneof the so-called seas i think-
the mare nubium or the mare humorum

  who are your passengers

  mainly louisianians and texans who sought refuge
on the mountains of central america few mexicans in
the lot made the trip without mishap the crescent
city was probably the first big atoliner to leave the earth
left about seventy-five hours after sherards final mes-
sage

  professor sherard is here now-was the first to ar-
rive harveston informed i was talking with him a
few hours ago professor francis burke and sherards
assistant a young woman are with him they are in a
cave under mount hadley in the apennines at least
three other planes have arrived

  is that so what did sherard have to say
harveston gave a brief account of his conversations with
professor sherard and the other earthians concluding
with the suggestion that the crescent city also proceed
to tycho if you are on the mare nubium you are only a
few hundred miles from tycho he supplemented

   well well be there unless the sand prevents our land-
ing ellington assured farewell till then

   doctor harveston was the first to reach tycho parking
his plane close to the crater leaving his sleeping child
in her bunk he immediately began to explore his sur-
roundings and his first discovery was that the walls of
the pit were several thousand feet high forming a stump-
shaped eminence in the center of a vast gently sloping
saucer of dark rock which in turn was surrounded by a
darker lava-like substance against which the craters
enormous streamers spreading in every direction shone
in glaring contrast

   he was scanning the almost perpendicular ramparts of
tycho wondering if they could be scaled when the hum
of a motor caused him to turn the huge bulk of the
crescent city loomed in the distance it landed behind
him on a smooth space about a mile from the crater near
one of the great rays

   its passengers immediately began streaming out of its
several doors many of them taking uncanny strides and
falling over one another befuddled by their new light-
ness after several attempts they were able to walk after
a fashion there were about thirty women in the group
some with babies in their arms and these proceeded more
cautiously being assisted from the plane by the men

   harveston setting out to meet them saw them gather
round a tall white-capped man whom he took to be
captain ellington whose gestures indicated that he was
addressing them he presently pointed toward harveston


amazing stories quarterly

and a minute later started in his direction heading a pro-
cession that moved slowly and fantastically some of the
earthians held hands to avoid mishaps but the most of
them except the women and some of the smaller children
made their own tedious way there was much overstep-
ping and consequent tumbles some of which ended pain-
fully on the hard surface

  where is professor sherard was captain elling-
tons first question when formal introductions were over

  pm wondering myself harveston replied sherard
said something about professor burke wanting to go over
the hieroglyphics again and i guess that is what is de-
laying him

  have you investigated the white rays yet

  from the air only they radiate in every direction
suppose we visit the nearest one while were waiting on
sherard

  i have an idea-

  ellingtons remark was cut short by an exclamation
from a keen-eyed youngster

  look here she comes

  captain ellington turned his binoculars on a speck
against the sky in the direction of the apennines its
professor sherard i guess

  his supposition was correct five minutes later the
first earthians to reach the moon arrived at tycho their
plane landing close to harvestons machine ernest and
mildred alighted together and were immediately sur-
rounded and warmly greeted

  we saw the crescent city pass over the mountains
early this morning ernest addressed captain ellington
but refrained from signaling because professor burke
was asleep	

  and where is professor burke now

  his non-appearance is due to his having locked himself
in his room with the declaration that he would stay there
until he solved the mystery of mount hadley ernest
explained

  he thinks the solution is near mildred supplemented
we were starting out to study tychos white rays
when you arrived harveston apprised ernest shall
we go on or signal the rest of the moon first

  ernest believed the signaling would be wisest pointing
out that some of the possible arrivals might be close by
and that it would be best to reach them before they took
flight again it was agreed that they would request all
with whom they might communicate to join them at
tycho and that they would meet an hour later and report
results

  ernest and mildred returned to the pioneer to find
professor burke still poring over his hieroglyphics cap-
tain ellington having apprised his passengers of his ob-
ject was followed to the crescent city by most of them
harveston found his little daughter still asleep

  in a few minutes the signals of the three planes were
sweeping the moon at every wave length

  at the end of the hour ernest reported having spoken
with hogrefe the american whom harveston had men-
tioned and with an italian named casella who believed
he was in the lunar alps harveston told of conversing
with a fellow-countryman named banks with a canadian
named farrow and with a spaniard whose name he could
not catch banks was somewhere on the plains and the
canadian believed he was on the mare tranquillitatis
captain ellington had made only one connection and
that with the german eckhoff who said he had left the
mountains and landed near a crater each ship had
brought from two to six passengers mainly the families
and relatives of the owners

  no trace has been found of the frenchman lataste
whom harveston had signaled during the night

  i move that we now visit the nearest ray ernest
said i think we shall find it most interesting he

then told ellington of his discoveries at the small crater
of reaumur

  mildred accompanying them they soon reached the ray
and found as ernest had anticipated that it was one of
many skillfully executed channels designed to carry water
to the crater by gravity the bottom of the course was
of the same marble-like material ernest and his compan-
ions had observed at reaumur and the sides were plast-
ered with the whitish cement they had seen there

  the ditch at this point was half a mile wide and not
more than a hundred feet deep but was narrower and
deeper toward the crater and less straight in the other
direction following the wide valleys of the slightly un-
dulating topography

  suppose we follow the channel to the base of the ram-
part ernest proposed i believe the tunnels through the
wall will be large enough for us to enter and explore the
interior

  and how thick are the walls do you suppose mildred
asked

  probably a thousand feet or more we will have to use
our pocket atolights

  they found that tychos tunnels were about fourteen
feet in diameter and straight as a rifle bore though they
seemed to have been fashioned with crude tools

  tycho reminds me of a mouse trap-one of those with
holes all around mildred laughed

  and it may prove to be a trap precipitating us into
the pit unless we watch our step ernest cautioned as
they prepared to enter the darkness

  the base of the wall was even thicker than ernest had
reckoned they had gone more than a thousand feet
before they saw light at the other end of the bore

  the interior of the ring-plain was bathed in sunlight
when they reached the tunnels end and they were awed
by the scene that greeted them stunned by the vastness
of it all it was so great in diameter that the eye could
not encompass it the basin was shaped like a shallow
cup and as smooth in places as asphalt its central region
barely visible to the unaided eye appeared to be not more
than a thousand feet below the level of the moons surface

  the earthians first viewed the great bowl through their
binoculars and then through a small telescope which cap-
tain ellington had with him the latter glass revealed a
circle of openings near the center

  what are they sherard-more tunnels harveston
inquired

  aqueducts ernest replied they probably carried
water to the distant habitations of the moonmen you
will notice that the deeper crevices in the floor of the
reservoir have been filled with cement it must have taken
the lunarians many centuries-millenniums perhaps-
to complete this work

  millenniums harveston echoed pensively and they
again gazed into the immensity of the basin lost in
thought

  ernests voice broke the silence

  lets return to the planes he said

              chapter xxi
              lunas story

he temporary camp was in a commotion when the
explorers returned

  another plane had arrived and the crescent
citiavs were gathered round it

  two men were standing by the new ship gesticulat-
ing wildly vying for voice

  one was professor burke the others speech ad-
vertised him as gallic his dapper appearance as a
parisian

  professor burke on seeing ernest and mildred
plunged toward them
the moon of doom



  i have found it he shouted ive solved the lunar
riddle let me tell you

  just a minute professor ernest restrained let
me welcome the new arrival

  i am antoine la taste late of paris the stranger
introduced himself in fair english i have the great
story i come from the far mountains of the moon

where i found-

  once more i ask you my friend to wait till i tell
my story professor burke barked

  ernest finally prevailed upon their companion to let
lataste have his way

  i reached the moon just before the frozen darkness
fell the frenchman began dramatically mon dieu
it was the long night i landed in the mountains near
a great valley that is a mile deep several miles wide and
i dont know how long we stayed there-the children
and i-until the daylight came again we were off with
the sun flying in what i took to be a northerly direction
the mountains were soon behind us and beneath us lay
a sandy plain dotted with small craters in about three
hours we came to another mountain range it was
much higher than the one we left and much more
rugged its peaks rose like fountains of the lava over-
lapping in many places imagine my surprise to find a
circular plain in the midst of the mountains i was
nearly across it before i saw the something that made
me reconsider all of the sudden in the center of the
plain was a deep basin and round it the ruins of many
buildings

  he paused for effect and breath and then went on

  i landed near the ruins and explored them for about
two hours the sun was well up by that time and it
was getting warm well theres not much to tell of
the buildings-there wasnt much left standing except
some columns-but listen those columns were inscribed
with characters that would addle the chinaman and
then i made another discovery i was sweeping the plain
with my binoculars to see what i could see when my
attention was attracted by what seemed to be rows of
openings at the bases of the encircling mountains fo-
cusing my glasses i discovered that they were doors
and that the walls around them also were covered with
the strange writing i didnt visit the caves-it seemed
quite possible that some terrible unknown creatures
were lying in wait in their depths so after taking the
few snapshots of the ruins i returned to the plane and
left in another direction i kept going until the greatest
surprise of all met my gaze-your camp down here

  the momentary silence that followed the frenchmans
strange narrative was blasted by professor burke

  congratulations my friend he exclaimed stepping
forward and giving latastes hand a vigorous shake
what you have told us is part of my own story now
they will believe me draw close all of you and i will
bare the secrets of the moon

  the professor drew himself to his full height and
donned his full dignity as he began in impressive tones
know you that luna is terras child but older than
her mother in point of life evolved the lunarians had
reached the apex of their civilization when we earthians
were still troglodytes-when man slew man in bestial
rage and ate the marrow of his bones

  life appeared here vast ages before it did on earth
for the reason that the moon being a much smaller
body cooled in a comparatively short time

  the moonmen have been extinct for at least 
years but i have deciphered their history as recorded
on the face of mount hadley

  as to how i solved the mystery an outline must
suffice at this time all picture writings we knew on
earth had common characteristics and i proceeded on
the hypothesis that a similar relation existed here-

that is that the characters on mount hadley were ideo-
graphic composed in large measure of objects repre-
sented by pictures and signs i soon discovered how-
ever that the lunar symbols were partly phonographic
indicating that the moonmen had reached a stage in
the evolution of writing if not in civilization com-
parable to that of the ancient egyptians

  so far so good but the fact that many of the ob-
jects familiar to the moonmen had no earthly counter-
part presented a blank wall some of them were easy
enough however for example their sun and star sym-
bols were almost identical with those devised by the
prehistoric earthians and so with their water sym-
bols-horizontal wavy lines representing a sea or lake
according to their length and perpendicular wavy lines
under an arch denoting rain

  with these definable characters as a nucleus my
task was to make the unknown symbols identify them-
selves by establishing their relationship to the known
signs much as a child reconstructs a picture from cuts
of cardboard

   but for a long time i could not make the characters
arrange themselves and more than once i was about
ready to admit failure hieroglyphics have always been
my hobby however so i carried on but for my famil-
iarity with all picture writings known on earth the
lunar legends would have forever remained a mystery
so far as i am concerned

   well i decided that i could be as obstinate as tha
symbols and to condense the story i concluded their
translation less than an hour ago the work is not so
complete as i should like there are a number of breaks
which i had to fill in deductively but i am confident
the translation is essentially correct

   millions of years ago-probably during the late oli-
gocene era of earth-the moonmen then in the dawn
of their civilization were dwellers of the plains ages
later probably during our late miocene era they had
attained a degree of civilization comparable to that on
which earths curtain of history rose it was then
that they devised their picture writing and becamc
builders instead of nomads the dawn of another era-
which i place at about  years ago-found the
lunarians nearing the peak of their progress

  it was then that their great change began the
moon had been gradually receding from earth through-
out the ages and was losing its atmosphere and its heat
fifty thousand years more and their lakes many of
which were located in the beds of craters were little
more than pools their mountain streams-there were
no real rivers-had dwindled to ice-choked rivulets the
globe was becoming dessicate and frigid

  eventually the lengthening nights became so cold
as to preclude life in the plain cities the moonmen then
sought refuge in the mountains in natural caves which
they later enlarged and extended till the hills were all
but undermined here in the bowels of the mountains
they spent their nights and during the long days of
the last few thousand years they worked at one thing
only-hoarding their scant rainfall

   the hieroglyphics on mount hadley tell of their piti-
ful struggle it took them ten thousand years to hollow
out the mountains and five thousand more to convert
the craters into reservoirs some of the pits were nat-
ural basins and needed no white rays channels had to
be dug to most of them however-thousands of them
the rays of ail but a few are now covered with sand
due to moonquakes or other disturbances they labored
for millenniums but were impotent against the greater
catastrophe-the dying atmosphere though toward the
last they devised a crude sort of fan to carry the air
into their caves

amazing stories quarterly

the site of one of their earliest refuges many thou-
sands went there during the first hegira and built a
city on the mountain sheltered plain this city a real
metropolis lasted more than a thousand years but the
cold finally forced its inhabitants to abandon it and
bore into the mountains

  an elaborate system of underground cities ultimately
penetrated every mountain range except the apennines
these were their sacred hills kept inviolate as the
domain of their god the great he-she whose fancied
likeness had been fashioned on the face of mount had-
ley in the heydey of their civilization

  the hieroglyphics indicate that their greatest cave
city was in what we know as the dorfel mountains due
to the proximity of the huge craters bailly and clavius
the pits of which like those of nearly all the principal
rings had been converted into natural reservoirs holding
the water conducted to their caves through underground
aqueducts there was another great city under the
liebnitz mountains this range according to the in-
scriptions is composed partly of pure marble-their
white mountains-and it was here that they procured
the material for constructing the white rays which
carried water into the reservoirs the stone being hauled
across the plains in vehicles pulled by mules which
resembled gigantic fleas

  he-she was their one and only god part male part
female the fetish was represented as sexless in the
belief that he-it rather-had subdued all passions
its likeness was built in bas-relief on hadley with its
face turned toward earth and its eyes fifteen feet in
diameter were constructed of hundreds of great dia-
monds yes real diamonds my friends

  the moonmen looked upon the vast ball of the earth
as an evil entity a thing that was driving them farther
into space and devouring their air and they supplicated
their idol to combat its power their sages seemed to
realize that the planet was inhabited for in the latter
days they had the lunar sculptors and artisans picture
the moons tragic history on the wall round the idol
possibly as an appeal for assistance

  their religion was sacrificial huge statues of he-
she were erected in each cave of the cave cities and
the victims were legion it seems they were crushed to
death between a sort of mortar and pestle contraption
in the idols lap

  due to the feeble gravity the moonmen evolved along
lines almost entirely different from those of their earthly
kin they were fully eleven feet tall huge-headed and
partly insectiform in structure though they were dis-
tinct vertibrates and human in several ways during the
last fifty thousand years of their tribulation however
they underwent a pronounced physical metamorphosis
due to climatic and atmospheric changes their bodies
became exceedingly bulbous as their lungs expanded to
enormous proportions their nostrils distended and their
ears enlarged their skin thickened and toward the
last nature was giving them hair as a protection against
the cold much of the moons lower life vanished dur-
ing the transition and if there were birds they must
have disappeared quite early as nothing with wings is
represented on the cliff

  i have said that the end came about  years
ago a million years might be nearer the mark they
sketched a map of earth on mount hadley and the pic-
ture shows the isthmus that once connected north amer-
ica and asia at bering strait and a continent that must
have been atlantis

  well the symbols tell many other things including
a legend that there once was a great ocean on the other
side of the moon but if youll glance at the sky i think
youll find it more interesting it looks as though its
going to rain

chapter xxii

burke forebodes

the lunar skies were streaked with straggling veils
of vapor so diaphanous that they seemed to doubt
their own existence

  on earth this would have portended only another dis-
mal day here it seemed a miracle and the aliens from the
larger sphere watched with wonders open eyes

  the ghostly wisps of gray moved slowly hesitantly as
if realizing their alienage and fearing to unite but
after a while they dared to be united writhing sinuously
and then meeting and merging to form a denser whole
it was then that the earthians became aware that a
goodly breeze was stirring and that the air was slightly
humid

  and when the terrific sun itself was all but obliterated
professor burkes voice rose above the hushed tones of
his companions the first to break the spell

  at last the moon shall touch her lips to drink he
intoned impressively absently as if addressing his muse
soon comes the rain and lunas awful thirst will be
assuaged napoleon said to his soldiers the centuries
look down upon you i say that between these clouds
and the last gray whirls that flecked the lunar sky five
thousand centuries look down

  do you think therell be a storm asked mildred who
with ernest captain ellington doctor harveston and
lataste was standing near the professor

  hardly that he smiled remembering the girls love
of natures violent moods it will be no more than a
gentle rain-maybe only a heavy mist i fear we shall
not hear the thunders muttered crash what do you
say ernest

  i guess youre right but i was hoping there would be
a real downpour im no weather prophet but ill pre-
dict there wont be any rain for an hour or so and i
suggest that in the meantime the six of us go over to my
plane and decide on our next move ive got the wander-
lust

  well sherard what do you propose ellington asked
when the conference was opened round ernests radio
table

  that we explore the sub-montane cities he submitted
we may have to stay here a long time unless the moon
crashes into the earth and i believe the caves will provide
shelter it is possible that we shall be able to establish
very habitable quarters there with the aid of our atoheat
do the caves contain real rooms professor

  the hieroglyphics are not so clear on that point but
i believe we shall find well-designed halls and apartments
-minus windows of course the lunarians were clever
artisans and their temples were things of beauty so
i should think they employed their skill and artistry in
fashioning their mountain dens

  fine ernest commented we earthians may be
able to set up regular housekeeping provided we can get
enough water and devise a method of ventilation the
water question is paramount of course the supply we
brought with us wont last much longer any sugges-
tions

  i think the rain will solve the problem professor
burke offered we wont get much from the clouds that
have just gathered but probably enough to form small
pools in the lowest parts of some of the reservoirs
but how will we get the water to the caves harves-
ton asked it would require a depth of several feet to
put in the aqueducts

  i was coming to that burke said my suggestion
is that we establish ourselves in the caves of the dorfel
mountains near the great pit of bailly we could then
readily fetch the water in our planes bailly and clavius
it appears are natural reservoirs surrounded by decliv-
itous land which made the construction of channels un-
the moon of doom



necessary i am confident the rain will be quite copious
before long the air is becoming more humid every day
do you think we should start for the caves at once
ellington asked

  yes and i move that we forthwith place professor
sherard in charge of the expedition and have him name
the starting hour

  only if professor burke is given equal authority
ernest amended and it was agreed

  then i second the suggestion that we start at once
ernest said the night is less than fifteen hours off and
we should lose no time in getting into the caves but it
would not be well for all of the planes to go at once
some of us should remain at tycho and keep the radios
busy signaling other earthians who may arrive before the
darkness comes i therefore suggest that only one plane
make the initial trip and return to guide the rest of us
after locating suitable caves

  ah the plan is the good one the wise one lataste
put in and for certain the distingushed professors
sherard and burke who discovered the moon and know
most about it shall be the ones to discover the caves i
so propose if i am in the order

  i agree with monsieur letaste harveston said
sherard and burke renowned lunarians even before the
great change began and who discovered the moon as
lataste puts it are best qualified as pioneers in the un-
dertaking at hand the decision rests with them of
course

  we gladly volunteer for the trip ernest responded
after noting professor burkes assenting nod and here-
with place captain ellington in charge of the temporary
camp while we are absent we will signal you immediately
we locate the caves and return as speedily as possible
bailly is only a few hundred miles off and it is probable
we shall be gone only two or three hours but during that
time a number of other planes may arrive here in response
to your signaling every plane should be prepared for
flight by the time we return does this meet with your
approval

  all replied in the affirmative except mildred who had
been a silent auditor

  speak up mildred ernest said youre a member
of the committee you know

  then i vote against the plan unless i am permitted to
go with you

  ah the venturesome mademoiselle as brave as she is
fair exclaimed lataste with old-world gallantry she
has my vote to go

  certainly you shall go ernest laughed wed be
lost without you wouldnt we professor

  as lost as our own world is burke said it will be
a great journey but something tells me one of us shall
never return his voice became grave i have always
scoffed at prescience and the like and now im beginning
to believe in it i have persistent presentiment that the
mountains are the end of the road for me fate perhaps
but ive always held that fate and chance were one i
had a strange dream during my last sleep it seemed
that i was standing before the great he-she on mount
hadley studying its hideous physiognomy when its lips
formed a malicious leer and uttered my name with a
hellish cry of vengeance the nightmare lingers

  nonsense ernest enjoined puzzled at his compan-
ions gloomy turn you have simply overtaxed your
nerves struggling with those hieroglyphics i dont think
there is any danger ahead of us but i insist that you stay
behind and take a long nap

  you must professor please do mildred pleaded
ernest and i can see it through i demand that you
stay

  no my child he soothed i must go if fate decrees
my finish why rebel see ive become a fatalist over-
night if my foreboding is nonsense as ernest says no

harm will come of my going-we will have a good laugh
over it when we return i havent been feeling quite
myself for some hours and maybe the trip will revive me
besides i want to explore the bottom of one of the big
craters i believe i shall find proof of the theory that
the pits are the remains of gigantic bubbles raised by
volcanic gases when the moon was molten the very
shallow cup of bailly will offer an excellent opportunity
for study yes i must go mildred only a coward is
frighted by dreams-or by death itself for that matter

  further expostulation only rousing him to anger
ernest and mildred reluctantly consented to his going
and decided to start at once

  but lets go out first and see if it is raining mildred
said

  they stepped into a fine mist that trickled off the back
of the pioneer in apologetic globules going over to
the crescent city they found most of the earthians
gathered round it reveling in the moisture like children
in a summer shower

chapter xxiii

the dorfels

the mist was turning into a light drizzle when
ernest and his companions left tycho and the
earthians who had gathered around the pioneer to
bid them well were soon lost in the blur

  i would rather have waited until the rain was over
ernest said but we havent a minute to lose i think
ill go above the clouds to get into the sunlight the
clouds are low and we should be able to see the peaks
above them

  he tilted the ship sharply upward and they soon were
flying over a shoreless sea of whirling vpor

  take your binoculars and look out for the mountains
professor ernest said after a while i think were
headed straight for the dorfels but the higher sum-
mits of the liebnitz chain may come into view first
they should appear to the left of us near the south
pole

  the pale bulk of terra blotting out much of the sky
seemed menacingly near in the bright sunlight of the
high altitude and mildred was filled with nostalgic
yearning as she viewed it

  how near is the earth now she asked

  about forty-seven thousand miles ernest informed
the moon has slowed down greatly since we landed
and will continue to do so until it comes to a full stop
about twenty-five thousand miles from earth that is
only an estimate of course it may stop at thirty thou-
sand but i think my calculation is about correct to-
ward the last it will advance less than a hundred miles
a day and that means it will be at least a month before
it pauses

  and if it doesnt pause professor burke queried
gloomily we have no guaranty it will remember

  ill admit its not in the contract ernest replied
but im sure it will otherwise well return home in
a hurry

  remarkable burke grunted and if we do the
resultant crash will hold no terrors for me the spirit
of that infernal fetish is calling for me i tell you

  for gods sake dont talk like that ernest pro-
tested youll give us the megrims i predict we will
not only return from the caves but will get back to
earth safely cheer him up mildred suppose you get
my telescope and look at the earth professor maybe
you and mildred can see whats going on up there

  the professor laughed dryly a clever ruse to make
me forget of course we cant see whats happening
on earth with the sun shining full against it while it
is broad daylight on the moon its almost as pale as
during the last fifty thousand years of their tribulation however
they underwont a pronounced physical metamorphosis due to
climatic and atmospheric changes

amazing stories

the day moon used to appear from earth but well
look just the same

  and then his voice carrying sadness and hurt i
know im not myself ernest and i wish i could snap
out of it ive never felt this way before

  he went to ernests compartment and returned with
the small telescope well perhaps we shall return to
terra some day he muttered as he turned the instru-
ment to a window facing the planet but my motto is
never expect anything and you wont be disappointed
you look first mildred

  it looks like bronze and its so big i cant see all of
it the girl announced after a minutes study but
i think i can see markings on it it looks cracked
its cracked all right and always was the pro-
fessor fulminated after a brief glance through the
tube

  that means it hasnt become a solid ball of ice and
that there is hope ernest commented its breakneck
velocity is keeping the ice moving its a glacial age
such as the globe has never known i want to study
it by night the first chance i get

  tycho was an hour behind them when the forbidding
liebnitz peaks hove into view and a few minutes later
mildred using the professors binoculars announced
the sight of the dorfels

  ernest nosed the plane downward wed better get
back under the clouds so we can be on the watch for the
caves he explained they may be on the other side
of the range you know and besides i dont care to
risk running into the lower peaks

  the rain was reverting to mist when they emerged
from the clouds beneath them lay a plain of the same
sandy formation as that round reaumur no moun-
tains were in sight

  the dorfels are about two hundred miles distant i
think ernest said and unless the mist disappears we
may not be able to see them until we are nearly on them
well have to go slow as there may be foothills keep
a sharp watch for them

  mildred still using the professors glasses soon
announced the appearance of miniature craters and
after they had loitered along about fifty more miles
the ramparts of a great pit became visible

  its bailly no doubt ernest said suppose you
hand the glasses to professor burke he may want to
inspect the crater as we pass over

  yes it may be my only opportunity the professor
lamented more cheerfully the mountains are just
on the other side arent they

  about seventy miles beyond i should say ernest
replied remarking the forced buoyancy of the query
we could see them now but for the mist

  the moonscape became slaty and sloping as they neared
the crater

  bailly proved to be even shallower than professor
burke had anticipated the ramparts of the great ob-
long bowl were not more than four thousand feet high
and were pierced at the base by water bores to drain
the surrounding lowlands and when the pioneer had
topped the ramparts and dropped to a lower level its
occupants found that the interior of the pit was con-
spicuously different from that of tycho instead of
the tunnels ending at the inside rim they continued in
the form of aqueducts for several miles resting on
arches built over a bed of lava-like rock so porous that
its fissures overlapped

  it looks like petrified sponge professor burke sub-
mitted it is evident that the holes were made by
escaping gas and im satisfied the craters were formed
the moon of doom



by huge bubbles but if bailly was used as a reservoir
why wasnt its bottom cemented like that of tycho

  ernest could offer no explanation

  i see the professor exclaimed upon turning his
glasses toward the center of the basin only the deep-
est part is cemented-out there where the aqueducts end
and there are no feeders coming in from the other
side

  the center of bailly was found to be a depression some
twelve miles in diameter forming a great bowl which
evidently had been enlarged and deepened by the moon-
men and into which the connecting aqueducts once
poured their precious burden the basin was so smooth-
ly plastered that it seemed enameled and at its bottom
forming a semi-circle on the side nearest the dorfels
was a row of openings which they took to be the mouths
of water mains leading to the mountains

  look cried professor burke pointing toward the
deepest part of the bowl look

  water-a tiny pool of it-was there

  the pioneer was over the farther ramparts when
mildred espied the peaks of the dorfels the mist was
vanishing and the clouds beginning to rift

  the dorfels were downhill from bailly the declension
starting just beyond the craters rim and becoming more
pronounced each mile no pressure had been needed to
carry the water to the sub-montane dwellings

  the mountains rose sheer from the foot of the decline
presenting an almost perpendicular cliff similar to the
wall of mount hadley

  ernest first sighted the dorfel caves and almost
simultaneously mildred called attention to the crumbled
ruins of several buildings some three miles in front of
the mountains

  the caves dotted the base of the cliff its entire length
a distance of several miles most of the openings were
uniformly small and square but near the center of the
row yawned a relatively large circular aperture it
was toward this opening that ernest aimed the plane

  id like to detour and explore the ruins he said
but well leave that for another day

  the pioneer came to rest about a hundred yards from
the big cave professor burke hurried out and was
the first to reach the entrance

  just as i thought he said when his companions
joined him the inscriptions say that this is the cave
of the mighty he-she-the place of the sacrifice lets
hurry and explore the other caves-i want to make the
acquaintance of the lunar god

  well lets go back to the plane and get our pocket
atolights ernest proposed and well signal the folks
at tycho that we have found the caves i guess they
think its about time they should hear from us

  but two hours were to pass before they entered the
caverns just as they reached the pioneer a great dark-
ness descended monstrous earth was coming between
the satellite and the sun

chapter xxiv
trapped

i ive more planes and one atoliner have arrived

  h the liner is from buenos aires and brings sixty
       passengers

  captain ellingtons voice came faintly the eclipse
affecting the radio ernest had signaled him immedi-
ately upon returning to the pioneer telling him of the
discovery of the caves

  the liner is the pinzona and is commanded by senor
ricardo castello ellington continued three of the
planes are from the united states the first to reach
tycho brought governor teale of california and his
party hogrefe the detroiter and eckhoff the ger-
man both of whom were signaled by harveston last

night were next in order having met en route the
atoliner came in a few minutes later followed by a ship
from augusta georgia bringing a lawyer named wright
and his family the last plane to arrive before the
darkness fell is from switzerland and brings a young
man named ferrier and several children refugees he
picked up in the alps the voyagers were widely scat-
tered and most of them had been on the moon many
hours we have swept the moon at every wave length
and communicated with eleven other planes from almost
as many countries president carmonne of france is
in one of them the eclipse is delaying them but all
should be here by the time you return

  a running conversation in which ernest gave further
directions as to the flight to the caves continued until
the pioneer was  longer in the shadow of the earth

  goodbye ernest then called we are leaving to ex-
plore the caves

  good luck ellington returned its still dark here

  the sun was shining brightly when they left the
plane the last veils of mist having vanished during the
eclipse

  which cave shall we explore first mildred asked
when they again stood before the gaping abode of the
moon fetish

  well let professor burke decide provided he doesnt
insist on the cave of he-she ernest answered come
on professor he had stopped in front of the idols
abode and was studying the inscriptions as if glued to
the spot come on and read whats written round some
of the other doors so we will know when we have reached
our future apartments suppose we investigate the row
to the left of us first

  well look whats here the professor ejaculated
when they reached the next aperture ernest theres
wealth in there that would make a croesus of each of us
this particular hole-in-the-wall houses the precious
stones that the lunarians fetched from far and near to
place near their god i dont know what kind of stones
are in there but ill wager there are loads of diamonds

  perhaps well find time to explore it before we leave
ernest said moving on

  the writing round the next entrance advertised it as
the sanctum of one of the high priests of he-she

  just as i expected burke growled and i predict
theres a long row of them before we come to the
humble domiciles of the laity the blackcoats have
always monopolized protection of the gods and gained
protection thereby the carving round this cave says
that it was the business of its occupant to see that he-
she was not mocked and-say ernest havent you
noticed anything peculiar about the formation of this
cliff no well what do you say to this he pointed
to one of many yellow veins with which the rock was in-
terstratified its gold the mountains are full of
it

  it looks like gold all right but are you sure

  ill stake my reputation on it the writing on mount
hadley told of a soft abundant ore which the lunarians
had learned to harden and put to practical uses most
of their tools and household fixtures were made of it
why this is a golden world no wonder the cosmic
architect put a great void between it and earth else
the moon would have been carted away by this time
and ill wager that some of those back at tycho will
try to mine the gold and rob the caves of their dia-
monds

  well i have always said the moon was golden de-
spite what the poets sang mildred sparkled

  but we may find plenty of silver too ernest
laughed

  see the veins are everywhere the professor con-
tinued as they moved to the next opening i wonder
how the moonmen tempered the stuff i must find out


amazing stories quarterly

if its my last discovery i think ill ask he-she when
im being devoured

  the next five caves were those of priests of lesser
ranks and then they came to a somewhat larger door
round which were hundreds of hieroglyphics

  its the door of death the professor announced
dramatically after a brief scrutiny we are now at
the entrance of the lunar catacombs it was here that
the dead of the cave city were brought the inscrip-
tions say that the hall extends nearly a mile and leads
to a labyrinth of larger cavities which constituted the
catacombs i wonder if the moonmen were embalmers
the writings are not clear on that point and if they
were it is likely that their frail bodies returned to dust
hundreds of centuries ago do you want to go in and
explore the tombs mildred 

  the girl shuddered im too imaginative to go in
there even if we had time id be seeing wraiths every-
where

   well here we are the professor apprised at the next
opening which was some distance from the door of the
necropolis this is the beginning of the moonmens
habitations shall we go in

  ernest suggested that they go farther down the
street to ascertain its probable length

  a good idea its a pity the doors arent num-
bered so we could learn what block were on the
professor seemed to have emerged from his doldrums

   the inscriptions deal principally with the names of
the occupants the professor imparted as they moved
on pausing at each door the names are meaningless
i cant translate them into words we might pronounce
since it appears that the caves continue indefinitely
suppose we go no farther ernest proposed when they
were nearly a mile from their starting point it is
certain there is room for all the earthians likely to
reach the moon this cave looks as good as any and
if the professor is willing well go in and look it over
and then hurry back to the plane

  they flashed their lights and entered the darkness
the professor leading and ernest holding mildreds
hand the strong shafts of light danced feebly eerily
in the forbidding gloom ahead the shadows moved
like animate things like sullen and sinister entities rue-
ful resentful malignant

  stepping slowly and cautiously the explorers swept
the interior with their atolights until the rebellious
shadows were dispersed enough to reveal a circular
chamber some eighty feet in diameter whose vaulted
top and smooth walls attested lunar artisanry hun-
dreds of inscriptions and numerous drawings were cut
into the rock and many large strata of the yellow ore
came into view

   this was a sort of parlor where they gathered during
the warmer part of the day professor burke observed
lets look for the outlet-i mean the entrance to their
living quarters i should say-say whats this

   his foot had struck something that emitted a metallic
ring he focused his light on the object as his com-
panions drew nearer

   its a table-no its a sort of seat and look-its
made of tempered gold

   it was a narrow bench similar in construction to those
they had known on earth except that its legs were longer
it was lying on its side

   the professor bent over it for a closer examination
its gold all right he confirmed and i suppose
theres more of them lying round well have to be care-
ful

mildred made the next discovery look there it
is turn your lights on the farther side of the wall
the three rays disclosed a passage that led toward the
bowels of the mountains-a square tunnel which seemed
to hold the pent-up darkness of a thousand hades-

a blackness which the powerful atolights pierced but
failed to diffuse

   must we really go in mildred asked apprehensively
her imagination pictured the darkness as that of erebus
itself and she fancied she could hear the lamentations
of the lost as they trod down the dusky aisle into eternal
night

   dont be afraid little girl professor burke said
gently theres nothing to harm us the darkness
cannot kill

   i dont think there is any danger ernest reassured
but if you wish you can remain at the door until the
professor and i return we wont be gone long

  oh no mildred protested what if you should
get lost in there i was a little nervous but im quite
all right now i insist on going

  holding hands they made their way to the passage
and entered cautiously their atolights illuminated their
path only a few feet

  well the floor seems solid enough the professor
remarked it was scarcely more than a whisper but
echoes wakened from their eon of sleep reverberated
ominously and boomed back the words

   and so do the walls ernest observed after they had
gone a goodly distance the lunarians were adept
burrowers at least

  they were fully a quarter of a mile from the en-
trance when they came upon long rows of slabbed doors
which extended on either side of the hall as far as they
could see the slabs were covered with inscriptions

  well here are the moonmens apartments the pro-
fessor announced shall we go in

but the doors appear to be sealed ernest remarked
i dont think so i daresay the slabs are on hinges
and open from the inside the moonmen had to shut
out the cold you know lets push against this one
theyre on hinges all right the professor attested
as the door yielded to their united strength look out
the stone gave way and fell inside with a terrific
thud that brought to life a thousand yowling echoes a
tomb-like odor almost malefic smote them

  just a i suspected burke drawled the moon-
men didnt have sense enough to invent hinges

  he pointed his atolight into the room the black-
ness was all but solid

  well we wont go in there for a while he said
lets go farther down the hall-maybe well find an
open door and the air will be less malodorous

   such an aperture soon came into view

   i guess well be safe in this one the professor ven-
tured theres quite a draft in the hall if you have
noticed and this room should be well ventilated by
this time ready to go in

   still holding hands they flashed their lights through
the opening and stepped inside

  a square chamber not more than forty feet across
was revealed as the light swept its walls in one cor-
ner they discerned an object that looked like a long
cot and near it were two small benches in the center
of each wall was a passage hewn through the rock
like the entrance

   a regular room if it had windows ernest observed
what is that protruding from the wall over there
a water pipe ill wager the professor said lets
go over and see

   correct again he certified upon examining the pro-
jection and look under it-theres the basin that
caught the water as it trickled in from the crater he
pointed to a cup-shaped excavation in the floor rather
crude plumbing but it served the purpose no doubt
well lets explore the adjoining rooms

they passed through the door to their left and found
themselves in a room similar to the one behind them
all of the rooms seem to connect ernest com-
the moon of doom



mented noting the doors that led to still other apart-
ments

  yes connecting rooms but no bath as it were
unless they bathed in their drinking water the pro-
fessor chuckled well what do you say about return-
ing to the plane there seems to be an abundance of
rooms and our heat and light can make them fairly
comfortable and the ventilation wont be such a prob-
lem with each room opening into another the moon-
men were not so dumb after all

  wait just a minute mildred said as they were
about to go theres one of those strange beds over
there in the corner and i think there are diamonds on
it i saw something flash as i turned my light there a
moment ago

  mildred this was the death-bed of some poor moon-
woman who must have perished in the last days when
the living were unable to bury the dead the professor
whispered as they leaned over the dusty slab of the cot
see there are two armlets and two anklets set with
precious stones lying in the dust they once adorned
do you care to examine them

  i wouldnt touch them for worlds the girl shud-
dered lets go

  ernest lets peep into the cave of he-she before
we leave the professor pleaded when they were again
in the sunlight it wont take but a minute or two
and pm sure we can spare the time

  ernest wanted to demur but yielded to his compan-
ions entreating tone

  it wont take but a minute or two burke repeated
as thev prepared to enter the cave are you afraid
mildred

  no professor im almost as eager as you to see
what the thing looks like

  they stepped inside and found themselves facing a
stone wall only a few feet from the entrance a square
door yawned in its center

  well see it through ernest answered the profes-
sors questioning look

  they felt the tingle of eerie adventure as their next
step took them through the opening and they flashed
their lights into the inner darkness

  there it is mildred cried i can see its blazing
eyes turn your lights on them

  he-she in all its hypnotic hideousness leered from
its throne in the deeper shadows as the light fell full
on its fantastic face

  and then a thunderous thud sounded behind them
the light from the entrance went out the door-
where was it

  they were trapped

chapter xxv
he-she

startled and stunned it was some moments be-
fore the prisoners grasped the gravity of their
plight

  professor burkes voice broke the solemn silence
snared he fairly bellowed caged like rats
ernest i told you that devil would get me but i didnt
think you and mildred were to suffer and its all my
fault-my fault trapped-to die like beasts there
is no hope

  dont say that professor ernest put in with forced
cheerfulness its not so bad as that well get out
of here all right wont we mildred the girl was
clinging to his arm lets examine the door pro-
fessor maybe its only a rock that has fallen and we
can push it away

  that damned demon did it i tell you burke
vociferated as they turned their lights toward the erst-

while opening well what do you know about that
its the work of fiends

  it was no stone that barred their exit what they
saw was a ponderous metal slab wedged firmly in its
enclosure

  look the jambs are grooved ernest pointed out
its plain that the slab operates like a window sash
but what caused it to fall

  he-she alone can answer that the professor mum-
bled what concerns us now is what will cause it to
rise he pounded the door with his fist and gave it
a lusty kick its at least a foot thick and made of

tempered gold if we had a crowbar-

  our atorays would make short work of it if i hadnt
been so stupid as to leave them in the plane ernest
deplored we should never have entered the caves
without them and i also am to blame for failing to
bring a pocket radio set my negligence is inexcusable
professor i feel like kicking myself

  no ernest im the fool-a thousand of them it is
my fault alone that were in here-in to stay

  please dont give up hope so soon mildred spoke
up there may be another exit im sure we shall
get out somehow

  of course we shall escape ernest reassured sup-
pose we see what our prison looks like

  turning and facing the idol they scattered their ato-
light until the chamber was dimly illumined from wall
to wall

  the room was square and about thirty feet across
its roof was high and convex with a few narrow
ventilation slits near the top three of its walls were
roughly finished but the one to the left of the entrance
was smooth and bore many inscriptions the floor was
made of large stone blocks closely fitted a small bench
in one corner was the only furnishing

  the prisoners gave only passing attention to these
details-they found it impossible to keep their gaze off
the grotesque figure of the moon god

  the uncouth form of he-she occupied a throne-like
structure that rested against the center of the back
wall the monster was about twelve feet high in its
sitting posture and was made of stone and tempered
gold with many-faceted eyes of enormous diamonds like
those of its bas-relief replica on mount hadley its
head body and legs were stone its arms gold and in
its lap clutched between its massive knees was a huge
golden bowl above which poised menacingly was a great
block of yellow metal gripped in its scaly hands the
arms were jointed and apparently movable

  the things face was even more repulsive than that
of its mount hadley likeness diabolic beyond descrip-
tion were its misshapen head its hellish leer its ghoul-
ish mouth

  but fascinating as the eyes of a monster serpent were
the great orbs of he-she

  in the weird glow that fell upon them they danced
with a radiance at once beautiful and baneful corrus-
cating the primal colors in dazzling terrible splendor

  and when the earthians unconsciously drawing nearer
under the charm of the fetish focused their rays on its
hideous head the brilliance was blinding

  how terribly beautiful mildred at length found
voice to exclaim

  yes some of those diamonds are as big as goose
eggs professor burke remarked prosaically

  the spell broken ernest proposed that they search
for a possible exit

  hopefully the quest began hopelessly it ended con-
vinced they were walled in on three sides by solid moun-
tain and on the other by an immovable barrier they
felt the helplessness that precedes blank despair as they
made their way back to the golden closure

  standing again in front of the wedged slab pro-

fcssor burke turned the light on the floor at his feet

  so thats the way the trap works he ejaculated
now if we only could raise this block-but we havent
even a penknife

  what is it professor his companions asked in
eager unison

  well this block rests on some kind of springs or
levers-i felt them give beneath my weight-and that
explains why the sash fell when we stepped inside

  lets see ernest stepped on the stone and felt it
give fractionally beneath the added weight

  now watch it rise the professor said as they stepped
off

  the block sprang up to its level

  springs burke confirmed and i suppose they
are about as strong as when they trapped the last
moonman due to the absence of moisture ernest lets
go over to the lettered wall and see what it has to tell
us you and mildred can hold your lights on it while
i decipher the writing

  with many an astute squint and enigmatic grunt he
studied the characters one by one and then reviewed
them before imparting his interpretation

  its a story that would make the priests of moloch
shed pitys tears he began of all the satanic machi-
nations ever evolved in the name of religion this is
probably the most diabolic it is difficult to conceive of
a more execrable creed except the earthly doctrine of
eternal torture

  as i have said he-she was the god-or devil-of
sacrifice the belief that the gods love blood seems to
have prevailed here as it did in nearly all primitive
religions of earth well he-she must have had its
fill

  i believe it was roosevelt who said that only those
are fit to live who do not fear to die it seems that
the lunarians reversed this axiom

  it is incredible but the inscriptions say that the
moonmen sacrificed half of their numbers to their god
generation after generation

  the monster in this cave was only one of many
such idols there was at least one in every sub-montane
settlement and before the moonmen became cave-dwell-
ers they housed them in temples on the plains

  they held that death was desirable above all things
in that it led to eternal rapture they were taught to
pray for death not life this belief would have led to
universal extermination but for a priestly pronuncia-
mento against suicide which branded it as the supreme
cowardice and cowardice was the unpardonable sin
the memory of every suicide was anathematized and the
fact that the lunarians were devout ancestor worship-
pers almost wholly restrained self-murder many of these
inscriptions are denunciatory of the felo-de-se but it
seems that the suicide was not barred from the joys
of the after-life because of his act

  the sacrificial phase of their religion was based on
a perverted conception of vicariousness they believed
that the virtues of those who gave their lives to their
god were transferred to the living they regarded the
victims of he-she as sacrifices yet abhorred their mem-
ory their praise was reserved for the beneficiaries of
the immolations

  upon reaching the marriageable age the sexes were
paired apart and cast into the cave of he-she-two
youths one time two maidens another one must die
that the other might live the survivors were regarded
as having proved through their victory over the suicidal
urge their worthiness to perpetuate the race and at the
same time to have received the perfections and none
of the weaknesses of the deceased this shows that
the moonmens metaphysical reasoning was about as
abstruse as the earthly brand of only a few decades ago

  those who embraced the death that dwelt in the lap

of he-she were pounded to a pulp by the great pestle in
the idols hands the superstitious masses actually be-
lieved that the fetish was alive it was the creation of
a fiendish mechanical ingenuity which seems to have
been peculiar to the priestcraft

  the writings do not explain the mechanism of the
monster but i think i can describe it it is probable
that the bottom of the bowl or mortar into which the
unfortunates climbed was adjustable and that pressure
on it released a sort of mainspring connected with the
idols arms causing them to churn the pestle violently
and that another arrangement operated in turn by the
pestles motion turned a rod that ran under the floor to
the trapdoor where it released a catch and caused the
sash to rise thus the death of one prisoner provided
escape for the other and the priests then reset the
trap

  the lunarians fashioned the eyes of he-she out of
their largest diamonds-diamonds many times the size
of any ever seen on earth the flashing orbs were sup-
posed to hypnotize as well as terrify

  well thats the story of he-she it means that two
of us may escape through the immolation of the other
he paused and when he spoke again his voice was
vibrant with emotion

  the long night will soon be here and even these
thick walls cannot- forfend us against the killing cold
i am ready to make the sacrifice to gladly die the death
while there yet is time for you to reach the plain before
the darkness comes

  before his dazed companions could cry their protest
another voice was heard a prolonged moan and then a
swelling threnody a blasphemous ululation and then
a horripilating hissing a gloating ghoulish shriek   
and then a dirge of death

  the sinister sounds were coming from the murderous
mouth of he-she

chapter xxvi
sacrifice

experiencing cold fear for the first time in her
life mildred screamed and grasped ernests arm
ernest himself was aghast and involuntarily re-
coiled professor burke though visibly startled intrep-
idly stood his ground and finally waxed pugnacious

  wail on and do your worst he defied shaking his
fist at the screaming god whose snarl all but drowned his
shout do you think we are children to be frightened
by mere sounds

  as if in answer to his challenge he-she uttered a
shriek at once derisive and truculent

  ah i have it the professor exclaimed just as i
suspected he cupped an ear

  i should have guessed it at first he laughed turning
to his companions its nothing but the wind an old
trick-the egyptians employed it in a similar way the
lunar high priests knew something about acoustics it
seems they ran pipes from the outside to the demons
throat theyre not visible of course-probably run un-
der the floor and up through the idols body the wind is
rising outside and that explains the noise

  my what a scare mildred sighed its hard to be-
lieve the thing isnt alive

  professor i didnt believe the moonmen were so
clever ernest remarked

  and neither did i until we entered this infernal place
it was a devilish ingenuity and as i have said was
probably the exclusive property of the priestcraft they
had to perform their miracles you know listen to that
wail-there must be quite a storm how long have we
been in here ernest

  nearly three hours

  and how close is earth
the moon of doom



  about forty-five thousand miles i should say

  well that means about twent-four hours of night
ahead of us-and its dark as night now in here with
the bodies separated by forty thousand miles-i figured
it out on the way from tycho-the time from each new
moon to the next would be about  days and the
length of the moons day and night combined would be
equal to the interval from new moon to new moon we
cant hope to survive the night without fire it means
the death of all of us unless the fetish is placated and
thats what im going to do-you mustnt stop me ernest
you and mildred must hurry to the plane

  my god professor you cant mean it ernest cried
you dont know what youre saying

  please please dont say that again mildred pleaded
in horror you mustnt think of doing that im sure
all of us shall get out alive but id rather we perish to-
gether than for you to go that way there is always
hope and who knows but that our friends from tycho
are already outside looking for us

  there is no hope theircompanion despaired avoid-
ing the girls frightened gaze there is but one way-

a sacrifice he-she beckons and i-

  i say you shall not ernest burst out peremptorily
i shall overpower you if you attempt it i would gladly
die myself professor to save you and mildred that
such a sacrifice would cause the door to rise is largely
conjecture is it not likely that the mechanism would
fail to respond after so long a time and dont you
realize that the shock of your sacrifice might kill mil-
dred

  his voice softened as he continued you are not your-
self just now old pal lets wait and try to find some
other way something tells me everything will come out
all right

  professor burke laid his hand on ernests shoulder and
spoke in a fatherly tone perhaps i have given up hope
too soon my boy perhaps the feeling that i must die
to save you two is but a vagary of a man who is growing
old but i feel that im to blame for your being here
and i would die a thousand deaths to undo my folly i
cant help looking the facts in the face ernest its al-
ready getting chilly in here and we cannot hope to live
through the night and it would probably be eternal
night for us even if we survived the cold i see little
hope that the people from tycho will find us we have
no food no water i cannot let you and mildred suffer
but we shall again try to find a way out if we could find

anything to burn we might-

  oh professor mildred cried excitedly im sure i
saw a black seam somewhere in here that looked like coal
its near the idol i think

  feverishly they began the search hoping against hope
first they scanned the wall to the left of the god stratum
of gold here and there-only mocking gold silently
tensely their hearts beating a tat-too they could hear
above the abated hissing of he-she they moved on to
the other side of the idol and resumed their quest

  here it is here it is mildred exulted flashing
her light on a dark streak near the bottom of the wall

  professor burke dropped to his knees for a closer scrut-
iny about a foot of the seam showed above the floor for
some three yards he passed his hand over its smooth
surface and then scratched it with his nails collecting a
pinch of dust in his palm

   it looks like coal but we mustnt rejoice too soon he
said after a minute that seemed an eternity wait until
we get some of it out and see if it will burn confound
it ernest i guess well have to dig it out with our hands
ive got it the younger man flashed after a perplexed
moment well wrest a leg from the bench in the comer
and use it as  pry

  the supports of the bench proved to be made of tem-

pered gold and after much twisting and pulling they re-
moved one of them

  it took them but a brief space to loosen several lumps
of the soft mineral and then they stood staring at it
blankly    fuel but no way to kindle it

  in vain the two men searched their pockets for paper
futiley they struck match after match and held them to
the finer particles the stuff glowed but would not
flame

  ernest rose suddenly and doffed his coat

im going to use it for kindling he explained
shed yours too professor perhaps theyll burn enough
to light the smaller lumps its certainly worth trying
ill contribute my hat mildred fluttered its flimsy
enough to burn readily

  well well light it first ernest accepted and pro-
ceeded to make the attempt hold up the coats pro-
fessor and ill use the hat as a flare

  joyfully they beheld the spurt of flame cling to the
woolen garments ernest then took the coats laid them
on the floor and put several small lumps of the mineral
on top

  in excruciating suspense they watched the flames dally
with the bits of black and when the lumps at last be-
gan to blaze it seemed they were witnessing the miracle
of fire for the first time

  its bituminous the professor rejoiced as ernest
consigned larger chunks to the fire the inscriptions
on mount hadley said something about the moonmen
getting their fuel from the mountains but i had no
idea it was real coal

  they seated themselves close to the blaze and reveled
in its genial warmth compared with their staid ato-
heaters an open fire suddenly seemed a wonderful thing

  they grew reminiscent under the spell of the glowing
embers and talked of many things they agreed that
their life on earth now seemed a separate existence a
sort of vivid dream their present state was even more
unreal had they dreamed the flight through space or
were they dreaming now

  at length they became aware that he-she had ceased
its dissonance thirst and incipient hunger reminded
them they had been in the cave several hours the
feeble light from the rifts in the roof was no longer
visible and they knew that it was night

  the realization caused professor burke to relapse into
despondency for several minutes he sat smoking his
pipe in silence staring dejectedly into the coals his
face funereal as the surrounding gloom

  and when he raised his head and spoke his voice was
heavy with hopelessness

  we have cheated the cold only to perish more miser-
ably and i could have saved both of you by giving
my worthless life

  life he continued with a philosophical turn what
is it after all i often recall robert ingersolls death-
less words

     life is a narrow vale between the cold and bar-
  ren peaks of two eternities we strive in vain to
  look beyond the heights we call aloud and the
  only answer is the echo of our wailing cry from
  the voiceless lips of the unreplying dead there comes
  no word but in the night of death hope sees a star
  and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing

  love i know it seems incongruous for me to even
speak the word the world has always regarded me as a
cold selfish old misanthrope incapable of sentiment but
i am now face to face with love it is of your love for
each other that i speak i guessed your secret-if
secret it is-long ago and since we have been together
i have come to love both of you as though you were my
own children you have filled a great void in my life


amazing stories quarterly

that damned demon did it i tell you

  oh professor mildred cried you mustnt talk of
leaving us we will find some way to escape and you
shall return to earth with us

  maybe so maybe so he soothed now i am going
to lie down by the fire and seek the oblivion of sleep
the long night wore on ernest and mildred sat
close to the coals and talked of everything except their
growing thirst and hunger and the fact that the smoke
was slowly filling the chamber

  at length they talked of love and ernest pressed her
to his breast for the first time my moon girl he
whispered

  iiow long have you loved me the girl asked trem-
ulously

  since that day at the seashore when you stood on
the rock and defied the storm

  i guessed it even then she murmured and rested
her head on his shoulder

  the professor slept fitfully and once his companions
caught the mumbled words listening love can hear
the rustle of a wing

  the fateful hours dragged by ernest tried to keep
mildred from thinking of their plight by celling her
over and over of his devotion occasionally he rose and
put more coal on the fire

  after several hours professor burke woke in a frenzy
of excitement and bounced to his feet with a shout of
triumph

  we shall be saved he cried to his astonished com-
panions i have a plan-it came to me as i woke i
was a fool not to think of it before

  his voice broke and there was infinite sadness in
it when he resumed

  something-call it anything you wish-tells me i
shall never leave this cave alive but i fancy i can see
you two going down the years hand in hand back on
earth
the moon of doom



  listen he continued before the pair could find
speech our friends from tycho will start out to look
for us as soon as it is light our plane parked out
there in the open can be seen for miles and they are
certain to find it then theyll begin to search the
caves for us the entrance to the home of he-she will
attract them as it did us but how are we to signal
them there is but one way and i have found it as
soon as morning comes we will take the bench leg and
begin beating on the door incessantly until they hear
us their atorays will then get us out in a jiffy

  the night is about twelve hours old-half gone we
can see it through without much suffering now you
children go to sleep and forget your troubles you were
right mildred-i shall live to laugh at the monster and
return to earth with you

  ernest felt that his friends elation lacked sincerity
but recognized the plan as their only hope and wondered
why he had not thought of it

  mildred told you we would find a way professor
he enthused and turned to the girl whose eyes were
sparkling with joy the professor bids us sleep
shall we obey

i was never more awake and pm not so thirsty
mildred replied i want to stay up as long as i can
so the three of them sat down again and talked of
many things-but not of the smoke that was slowly but
surely filling the chamber

the long night wore on they talked until thirst
parched their tongues and the smoke became almost
unbearable and then they sat staring vacantly into the
fire thinking thoughts they dared not utter    and
the dreadful night wore on

  we must lie down with our faces to the floor er-
nest gasped when the smoke began to stifle well
breathe easier there

  the professors labored breathing soon became slum-
berous but to ernest and mildred lying with their
faces pressed close to the rough floor sleep beckoned but
to mock the girls wan face revealed her silent suffer-
ing my brave little girl ernest managed to whisper
huskily and drew her to him until their lips met in a
pathetic kiss

  the spectral hours flagged by until the dark awaited
dawn professor burke slept on despite his gasping
and coughing the smoke was becoming so dense that
ernest hesitated to replenish the fire but when he let
it die down for a brief space numbness soon began he
knew that mildreds suffering must be greater than his
and wanted to cry out in his impotence marveling the
while at the girls transcendent fortitude

  after what seemed another eternity professor burke
aroused apparently alert and in parched whispers again
implored his companions to seek respite in slumber as-
suring them he would stay awake and tend the fire

  ill wake you when the folks from tycho come he
cheered i predict theyll be here within two hours
after sunrise

  at length ernest and mildred felt themselves sinking
into merciful insensibility

  they were wakened by a terrific ominous clangor a
metallic squeaking and pounding they sat up painfully
and rubbed their eyes consciousness brought cognition
of the horrible truth the professor was missing and the
noise was coming from he-she

  and then they became aware that a great shaft of light
was contending with the thinning clouds of smoke the
door was open and it was day

  side by side they crept and crawled to the opening
and on into the blinding sunlight

  aiter a few undiscerning minutes they descried the

glittering hull of the pioneer and then dim in the far
distance a row of moving specks

  it was the aerocade from tycho

chapter xxvii

the lunar necropolis

once more the cave city of the dorfels was peopled
after five thousand silent centuries its corridors
and chambers again rang with life albeit the
sounds were alien

  a day and a night has passed since ernest and mil-
dreds escape from the trap of the he-she they were
almost fully recovered physically but their mental ordeal
had left marks which they knew would never heal entirely
they felt that they had aged and beheld in each others
eyes shadows that should not have been

  nightmares with he-she the incubus disturbed their
sleep and they feared that the pounding of the monsters
murderous pestle would reverberate forever in their ears

  captain ellington in relating what had taken place at
tycho after his last communication with the pioneer
told of the camps anxiety and consternation when the
hours passed without further message when the eclipse
was over they had signaled several other planes all of
which arrived before sunset alarmed by the continued
silence of sherards ship they had made every effort to
signal the craft and throughout the night which they
survived by keeping the atoheat at maximum the radios
were kept busy and then with the first rays of the
morning the aerocade had set out for the dorfels fail-
ing to find the caves until the greater part of the range
had been covered

  at last we saw the plain and the glistening wings of
the pioneerellington related and when we found you
you were more dead than alive and so blackened by smoke
fou were hardly recognizable

  twenty-three planes and two atoliners the crescent
city and the pinzama had composed the squadron from
tycho and on the morning following their arrival two
more ships were guided to the caves by signals

  the signaling had been continued day and night but
without further response and ernest was at last con-
vinced that the two hundred and seventy-five people in
the cave community were the only earthians to have
reached the moon the realization stunned him he had
hoped there would be many thousands

  a row of caves to the right of he-shes dungeon had
been selected as the dwelling of earths last handful
atoheat and atolight and the furnishings from the planes
made the caverns quite habitable save for the scarcity of
water the small pool that shimmered in the depths of
bailleys distant pit was rapidly disappearing under the
suns strong rays and what was left of it was being
brought to the caves by assigned planes stored in every
kind of receptacle obtainable and then boiled and filtered

  upon reaching the caves the earthians had established
a sort of community government with president car-
monne of france at its head when ernest was suffi-
ciently recovered however full authority had been vested
in him despite his reluctance

  there was little for him to do the community was
largely self-governing and its heterogeneous population
representing nearly every race had quickly merged into
a helpful democratic whole

  one of ernests first acts was to have the remains of
professor burke removed from the mortar and interred
in front of the cave of sacrifice and around the grave
mildred had planted some of the seeds she had found in
his belongings on the rough slab which marked his
friends strange resting place ernest saw to the carv-
ing of these words the spot where man has died for
man is holy ground-a quotation from ingersoll whose


amazing stories quarterly

works along with those of schopenhauer mildred had
also found in his bunk

  he-she would never wreak again the mechanism that
operated the trap and the idols arms had been wrecked
and the door of the cave removed the inside of the
golden slab bore mute testimony of professor burkes
last efforts to signal rescue it was covered near the
bottom with countless nicks where lying on the floor of
the smoky chamber he had sounded his futile tat-too
the bench leg its ends battered was found where he had
dropped it when abandoning all hope he had made his
sacrificial decision the dust on the floor showed where
he had crawled to the idols feet to climb into the bowl
of death

  the earthfolk had found it impossible to adjust them-
selves to the lunar schedule of light and darkness so
they were living by their own timepieces dividing the
day and night into twelve-hour periods as nearly as pos-
sible and eating and sleeping and going about their
affairs regardless of moontime except for their confine-
ment to the caves during the day part of the night and
where the stupendous earth shut off the light of the
sun each day the moon was shrouded in ecliptic gloom
for more than four hours

  during the early part of the nights which were get-
ting warmer as the moon retained more of the suns heat
the earthians did little but gaze upon the monstrous
mother globe whose green expanse all but monopolizing
the heavens flooded the satellite with emerald brilliance
terra was now the moons moon-terra the terrible
threatening to destroy the daughter sphere she had driven
away at birth and whose revengeful return was now
imperiling her own existence

  during the long periods of sunlight the men accom-
panied by some of the more adventurous women made
many exploration trips into the caves and mountains
the nearest mountains were visited first and yielded
much new knowledge concerning the vanished lunarians
various kinds of furnishings-all made of tempered
gold-were found and many other golden objects such
as basins urns and the like not to mention bracelets
anklets and other jeweled adornments

  the caves fairly reeked with gold great veins of it
were visible in nearly every wall and the deeper the
explorers penetrated the more they found

  ernest himself led the exploration of he-shes treasure
trove and true to professor burkes prediction it con-
tained loads of precious stones but contrary to his
prophecy the earthians did not fight for possession of
the gems nor try to mine the gold

  the stones were sealed in vaults which had to be opened
with atorays there were four vaults of diamonds two
of pearls and two of a strange red-green stone that
seemed a mating of ruby and emerald some of the dia-
monds all of which were cut weighed more than a thou-
sand carats the pearls also were the largest and most
perfect the earthians had ever seen

  ernest wondered where the moonmen had procured the
pearls the giant bivalves that produced them must have
had their being in some sea he reasoned and there had
never been a lunar sea unless the legen  that professor
burke had found on mount hadley of a i ocean that once
existed on the other side of the moon was more than
fable

  diamonds and pearls meant no more than polished
pebbles now but still were things of beauty so ernest
divided the contents of the vaults equally among the
people next day he saw some of the children playing
marbles with the pearls

  another expedition led jointly by ellington and har-
veston succeeded in reaching the lunar catacombs and
there more than half a mile from the mouth of the
winding tunnel their atorays revealed a city of ten thou-
sand tombs

  a vast cavern circular and at least two hundred yards
in diameter formed the lunar necropolis the wall of
the slightly arched chamber was about twenty-five feet
high and regularly studded row on row with round seals
of gold fitted flat with the surface so close together that
they almost touched there were fourteen full tiers of
them and another at the top extended almost half round

  removing one of the plates with their atorays the
explorers found a cylindrical cavity about three feet wide
that penetrated horizontally into the hard rock a distance
of about twelve feet

  a handful of dust was all that remained of the strange
creature whose tomb the cylinder had been-a handful
of dust in which reposed a few tarnished ornaments

  after a score of seals had been removed in the hope of
finding a mummified moonman the explorers convinced
the quest was futile turned their attention to a circular
elevation in the center of the chamber it proved to be
a flat-topped structure some seven feet high and twelve
across with steps all round and harveston and ellington
guessed that it was a sort of dais where the lunar priests
had performed their funeral functions

  then beginning to feel the effects of the musty insuffi-
cient air the party left the gold-studded place of the
dead

  it was raining when they emerged from the tunnel half
an hour later-raining so hard that the earthfolk had
taken to the caves a blinding flash of lightning greeted
harveston and ellington as they reached the mount of the
passage but this did not deter them from hurrying to
ernests quarters to report their discovery they found
him and mildred standing near the door of their cave
the girl exulting in the storm

  next morning ernest called the people together and
addressed them

  another great change faces us and no one can fore-
tell what it will bring he began

  the earth is less than thirty-one thousand miles way
and the stage of critical proximity is very near the
moon may stop when it has gone a few hundred more
miles or it may not pause until it is within twenty-five
thousand miles of the planet and we are not sure it will
stop at all

  but when it has gone a few thousand more miles at
the most and the attraction of the earth is counterbal-
anced by the push of the tides one of three things must
take place the moon will pause for a brief period and
then recede rather rapidly or go back at a snails pace or
fall to earth like a plummet

  i believe however that a quick recession will occur
this is in accordance with the bartonian theory which
is that the satellite after being flung from its molten
mother receded at a rate of several thousand miles a day
its speed gradually diminishing as the tidal force de-
creased until when it had gone approximately 
miles it all but came to a stop and required millions of
years to attain the distance it had prior to the great
change it would seem of course that its early recession
would not be more rapid than the latter stage of its
advance but when the tension of its pausing period is
broken the tidal reaction will probably cause it to spring
away for the first few thousand miles

  as i said in suggesting the migration to the moon
the earth would be habitable with the moon no nearer than

	miles but could we survive the moons return
to its old orbit and would we ever be able to return to
earth these questions are unanswerable it is pos-
sible however that the satellite would retain some of the
planets atmosphere for a while and that the air path
between the two bodies though much thinner than at
present would be dense enough to support our atoplanes
operating under full power and it is possible that we
could set sail for earth before the moon reacherl the
 -mile point
the moon of doom



  if the bartonian theory does not hold it will take
the sphere centuries to recede a thousand miles in which
event earths rotation and frigid temperature would
render it unhabitable for eons

  there is a possibility of course that neither of these
things will occur it may be true as professor burke
feared that the moon will crash into the planet but i
am confident it will stop the earth is so near that we
can see without the telescope that its surface is a broken
moving mass this means that the globes fearful ro-
tation has kept the ice from becoming a solid crust the
world is wrapped in a polar sea whose colossal icebergs
churn everywhere as mountainous waves lashed to fury
leap toward the tormenting moon but for the tides the
moon long since would have crashed into the earth as
it is i believe they are powerful enough with the atomic
attraction nearly if not entirely dissipated to stop tho
satellite and send it back into space

  and when the moon falters hard pressed by contend-
ing forces its greatest tribulation will begin it is then
that earth will have her revenge the push and pull
will shake the smaller sphere to its very core and at
last when the breaking point comes and the moon is cast
back for a few thousand miles its convulsions will all but
wreck it

  the moonquake will be of indeterminable duration
and it is then that our fate will hang in the balance the
severity of the shocks will about dislodge the mountains
and it is almost certain that the undermined parts of
the ranges will cave in

  the moon is now moving earthward at a rate of less
than two hundred miles in twenty-four hours having
slowed down so greatly in the last week that the nights
are almost as short and pleasant as they were on earth
but the moonquake may begin at any time i do not be-
lieve however that it will commence until the moon has
gone about five thousand more miles nonetheless we
can trust no longer the safety of the caves beginning
tonight we must park our atoplanes at the doors and
be ready to seek refuge in them when the first tremors
come to remain in them until the worst is over

  professor pickering and other noted lunarians be-
lieved that the moon might revolve on its axis if it were
only a short distance from the earth and so did i but
such has not occurred and i believe luna will con-
tinue to show the same face to earth regardless of
what might happen unless she actually crashes into the
planet

  that is all i can tell you and now with your con-
sent mildred and i shall start on an adventure that has
lured us ever since we came here we want to make a
hurried trip to the other side of the moon before the
change occurs we expect to return before night but
i shall place president carmonne in charge of the camp
during my absence i think we shall find the bed of a
great ocean on the other side

chapter xxviii

the other side of the moon

through an eerie twilight that was neither dawn
nor dusk the pioneer sailed on the camp of the
earth-folk lay in the fierce sunlight hundreds of
miles behind ahead only ominous shadows and the
portentous unknown

  a feeling that was akin to fear chilled mildred as the
ships wings cleaved the gloom it seemed to her that
they were entering the dread abode of an incorporeal
something far more malignant than he-she-a sinister
something that might she mused be lunas very soul
for the moment she thought of suggesting that they
return to the caves but just then ernest called to her
excitedly and pointing ahead his face advertising utter
rmnzement

  high in the darksome distance probably not more
than fifty miles a long irregular line of brilliance
flashed against an ebon background

  what is it the girl cried

  i cant imagine unless its an electrical phenomenon
similar to our northern lights uncanny isnt it look
its as steady as reflected sunlight-and maybe thats
what it is but what could be reflecting it

  the serrate streak of light seemed to ascend as the
pioneer advanced this ernest reasoned was because
he was flying low and level and then when the
phenomenon seemed almost directly above them parts of
it began to fade out leaving a row of flashing dots and
curves

  mildred cried out in wonder and in the same instant
ernest slowed the motors and started the helicopter a
minute later the atoplane was faltering and hovering like
a bewildered bird

  the resplendence above them was sunlight playing on
the peaks of lofty mountains

  they must rise abruptly ernest said after he had
brought the machine to poise its a range not re-
corded on our lunar maps they could not be seen from
earth because this part of the moon was always in
shadow it means we are beyond the lunar south pole
and on the threshold of the other side

  how near are the mountains the girls voice was
instinct with excitement

  probably not more than ten miles and they must
be about fifteen thousand feet high and the summits at
least are white the breaking up of the light-see
theres not much of it left now-is due to the sinking of
the sun we had better rise before all the light is gone
i suppose we can rely on our searchlights to avoid a
crash but i dont care to take a chance with those moun-
tains until i learn their height and how they rise

  but wont it be too dark for us to explore the other
side

  not much darker than it is here but darker than i
expected the sun is still high a few hundred miles be-
hind us you know and due to the air scattering the light
it wont be so very dark beyond the mountains-unless
we go too far i dont intend to do much exploring-only
to satisfy myself about that lunar sea and i have an
idea well find it just on the other side we probably
shall be returning within two hours i dont think we
need fear about what well find on the other side still
there is some danger-the unknown is never safe should
anything happen to our plane it is possible we might
never return perhaps we should go no farther mil-
dred im not afraid but i am thinking of you theres
no need to run the risk weve already experienced
enough suffering at the hands of the moon and i would
be a brute to carry you into further peril suppose we
let the other side alone come let us return to the
caves i insist

  the girl knew he spoke sincerely but only for her
sake alone he would have dared mountains twice as
high and skiej as dark again she could be as brave
as he

  i wouldnt think of returning she replied i am
quite unafraid and really eager to go on if it is too
ugly we neednt land lets hurry before all the light
is gone from the peaks

  ernest applied nearly all of the pioneers energy to
the helicopter and the big plane shot up like a balloon
quivering to the strain at fifteen thousand feet the
glow on the peaks was still above them half a mile high-
er and the few remaining flashes were under them ap-
parently about ten miles away ernest then stopped the
helicopter and steered straight ahead of the rest of
the mountains nothing was visible until the plane was
within two miles of the light then through the dusk
they discerned enough of the mighty range to know that
amazing stories quarterly

it rose almost perpendicular and that the tops alone ap-
peared to be whitish stone probably marble it seemed
that nature had tried to erect an insurmountable wall to
hide the moons black back

  the last light on the peaks went out just as they passed
over but more gaunt ridges were faintly visible through
the gloom ernest descended a few hundred feet to get
a better view of them holding the plane to its slowest
pace and turning the searchlights full ahead

  they had gone not more than twenty miles when the
mountains disappeared suddenly from under them the
range evidently ended as abruptly as it began

  the other side of the moon ernest rejoiced and
where shall we go now i think ill go on for a little
while and find a landing place perhaps-

  a hissing sputtering sound came from the motors
the plane lurched downward so suddenly that ernest
almost lost control of it

  its nothing serious little girl he assured his startled
companion just an oil leak i think i can repair it in
a few minutes after we land well glide down

  after many spirals which should have brought it to
land the pioneer kept descending the altimeter showed
ernest he was below sea level

  were over the bed of the lunar ocean he remarked

  a few more spirals and the searchlights brought the
bottonuof the great basin to view the pioneer careened
to a stop on a bed of pebbles and sand

  well our tour of exploration is over ernest said
we must return as soon as i repair the plane its much
darker here than i anticipated but come lets get out-
side for a bit so we can say weve stood on the floor of
the lunar sea well pocket a few pebbles as proof

  keeping in the path of the searchlights they strayed
only a short distance picked up a handful of the smaller
rocks and were about to return when mildred gave a cry
of discovery and held up her find for inspection

  it was the shell of a huge bivalve nearly as large again
as any they had ever seen

  now we know where the moonmen got their pearls
ernest commented but how did they get across the
mountains how professor burke would have enjoyed
solving that mystery and i guess he would have wanted
to set out at once and find the beds of the rivers that fed
the sea there were no big streams on the exposed side
you know so all of the rivers must have had their sources
on the hidden half come let us return to the ship i
think i can repair the leak from the inside

  the trouble proved more serious than ernest thought
the motors were almost drowned in oil

  after three hours the job still baffled him it was get-
ting quite dark and mildred watching the stars was
astonished to see those near the horizon blotted out rather
suddenly clouds were gathering

  within another hour the entire sky was overcast and
then came inordinate flashes of lightning that revealed
miles of the surrounding basin and silhouetted the nearby
mountains the boom of the thunder was ear-splitting

  ernest finished soldering the leak just as the storm
broke

  i hope it doesnt last long he said the sun will
soon be down on the other side and unless we get back
over the mountains by then well have to stay until it
rises again

  but the storm lingered growing in fury the down-
pour was as heavy as any they had seen on earth and
when the elements ceased their frenzy and the stars came
out again-came out in splendor far more gorgeous than
the earth pair had seen since their trip through space-
it was night and darkness cimmerian darkness fell upon
them like a suffocating blanket

  ernest switched off the searchlights and turned on all
the interior illumination the radio soon had them in
touch with captain ellingtons ship and ernest apprised

the operator of what had occurred tell ellington we
are in no danger and will be back in camp in a few hours
after daybreak

  communication with the camp was established at in-
tervals during the early hours of the night and pro-
fessor burkes books also helped to while away the time
until mildred fell asleep her head on ernests shoulder

chapter xxix

back to earth

  t must have been near midnight when the moonquake
  began

     the great paroxysm came without warning the
sphere reeled as from a staggering blow reverberations
sepulchral and oppressive cluttered the air the moon
jumped and jerked curveted and convulsed until its epi-
lepsy seemed a dance of death the earth pair felt the
pioneer slip and slide and knew that the surface was
shifting

  on into the night the upheaval continued with increas-
ing intensity ernest knew that the moon was being
shaken to its very center and doubted whether it could
survive the torture the din of the havoc became deaf-
ening overwhelming a staccato ululation rose above the
rumbling terra was having her revenge and luna was
howling her terrible agony and hate

  the major struggle ended as abruptly as it began a
shock that racked the satellite to the verge of destruction
was the finale

  it was over but the vanquished orb kept quivering
ernest looking at the stars saw them scurry across the
sable sky and knew that the moon was being shot back
into space

  he immediately tried to signal the camp and tried
again and again silence he feared the worst

  soon as the murksome morning broke over the vanished
sea the pioneer was off the mountains were crossed
without difficulty some of their peaks as seen through
the gloom appeared to have toppled and a few minutes
later when the plane burst into the sunlight the marred
moon lay revealed

  what had been a plain was now an anomalous waste
the surface was cracked warped sunken bloated huge
rocks protruded here and there some of the fissures
were abysmal

  the last vestige of hope for the survival of their com-
rades perished as soon as the dorfels came into view the
great range was utterly ravaged and all but overthrown
from a distance it was seen that hundreds of peaks had
cracked and crashed and when the pioneer passed over
the devastation thousands of prodigious fissures yawned
hungrily here and there appeared great sinks as if the
mountains had been mere papier-mache mounds trod on
by gog and magog

  and when the pioneer landed not a trace of the cave
city could be seen millions of tons of rock had avalanched
from the troubled heights and snuffed out all ernest
believed that the destruction came with the moons first
spasm and that the planes at the doors of the caves had
been buried before earths last lot hurrying from their
collapsing cells could reach them

  infinite loneliness and sadness engulfed the man and
girl realization that they were earths last pair stunned
them left them dazed

  when after many minutes ernest spoke his voice
was hollow alone in a universe of death he said
perhaps it were better we had perished too

  and during the nightmare days that followed while
they were waiting for the regressing moon to undo some
of the damage on the planet that they might venture
to return they fancied more than once that they had died
in truth and now were phantoms on a spectral sphere
occasionally frnest would point his telescope at the earth
the moon of doom



and once mildred visited the garden she had planted near
the professors grave and found green things growing
the grave itself was buried under the slide of rock as
was the nearby house of he-she

	   

one man and one woman-terras final twain-strug-
gling through space on a treacherous thread of air
behind them a mobile moon tremulous in retreat be-
fore them a weary world seen as a glacial globe around
them flashing through the embracing ether the exquisite
sublimity of the spheres

  the air was so tenuous that the pioneer could scarcely
hold its course with all motors going at top speed it
could not make more than four hundred miles an hour
once a small pocket was encountered and the plane fell
hundreds of feet

  the telescope revealed that earths ice-shroud was
breaking up rapidly and when they had gone about half
the distance land began to appear the air was becoming
denser

  when they were within five thousand miles of the
planet some of its surface alterations were disclosed
it was impossible to identify the continents much of
which could now be seen there was land where water
should have been and seas where land

  and when the continents became more clearly outlined
they were utterly alien to those with which the earth
pair was familiar great ice ridges appeared on most of
them near the equatorial line and extended far to sea
the americas could be discerned but seemed to have
shrunk greatly and the isthmus region was a zone of ice
with the exception of australia which was readily rec-
ognized they could not be sure of the other continents
much of what they took to be europe had disappeared
in the sea or under an ice sheet which covered the south-
ern part much of asia including all its island fringe
likewise was gone the northern half of africa was
hidden entirely by an ice cap and part of its southern
coast had been washed away small islands had been
born in every sea

  the turning of the globe bared another astounding
change the poles were no longer icebound land hidden
since some previous glacial age lay naked and there
was much more of it near each pole than geologists had
believed there were still some glaciers on it however

and thousands of great icebergs in the surrounding seas

  the truth dawned suddenly on ernest-the tortured
earth had shifted on its axis

  the pioneer was now descending rapidly bringing
other changes into view it was seen that all the moun-
tain ranges had been worn down some of the smaller
chains having virtually disappeared there were many
new rivers and some of the old ones were blotted out
dark blotches here and there in the interior of the con-
tinents probably were the remains of cities

  ernest brought his ship to rest on the coast of a con-
tinent which he believed to be greenland

  a few minutes later the man and the girl were plod-
ding along the beach learning to walk again they
seemed to have become things of lead ponderous and
cumbersome it was as if they had never known earths
gravitation

  the sun was shining and a breath of warmth was in
the air though the chill from the icebergs warned of
bitter nights

  ambling some distance from the shore they found
grass and weeds cropping up earth was not dead after
all it would give them sustenance and so might the sea
there was enough concentrated food in the plane to last
them several months and then they could plant the grain
and vegetable seed left by professor burke the pioneer
would house them and protect them from the cold

another adam and eve but a strange eden ernest
said whimsically an eden sans everything but us

  a new adami and heva mildred smiled its an
older account of the creation than that given in genesis
and much nicer i think i was reading about it in one
of the professors books

  yes i recall it ernest said the supreme brahma
put the man and woman on an island and told them to
remain there but adami persuaded ileva to migrate
brahma cursed them both but the man spoke curse me
but curse not her it was not her fault but mine the
supreme brahma said i will save her but not thee
but the woman did not wish to live without him and
said if thou wilt not spare him spare neither me for
i love him then the great brahma relented and said i
will watch over you and your children forever 

ernest kissed the girl and held her in long embrace
then hand in hand they began to explore their paradise

the atomic riddle

ie citizens of houston new jersey might
have been observed about two oclock of an
afternoon in october - congregated
about the twelve-story building of the
castile bank and trust company
night before this gathering of citizens
 in notes the bulk of it in large denominations
had been placed in the companys brand-new modern
safe in the presence of at least six employes of the
bank the cashier one of the most prominent men of
houstons younger set had set the combination and
gone home over night the money had vanished the
safe was intact

  roger bolton the cashier was the last of an old
family which had numbered statesmen engineers and
educators in its ranks from early in the nineteenth cen-
tury his college career had been brilliant he had won
the right to wear the university letter on his sweater
in short at thirty he might be considered to have
launched himself on a fine career in the world of
finance his salary was  a year a sum which
the bank considered a sufficient guarantee against
temptation

  being a tall fine looking chap athletic with reg-
ular features and good bearing it had aroused no
astonishment when his engagement to the daughter
of one of the richest financial wizards of new york
was announced olive velie at twenty-five was still
unmarried although her opportunities included four
or five possible titles and two or three possible bar-
onial estates she had large dreamy eyes above which
were delicately lined brows a nose not too large yet
scarcely negligible a mouth not exactly bowed but
rather inclined at times to a straight-lined severity
her chin was well rounded cheeks not too full and her
neck was very shapely and pillar like she was full
bosomed and had abundant dark hair

  olive had walked into her fathers office while he was
discussing with roger bolton the terms of a new
issue of molgravian bonds-molgravia being one of
the balkan states somewhat enlarged by the league of
nations after the world war boltons grasp of the
subject aroused old veiies admiration to such an ex-
tent that he complimented
the young man on his sug-
gested distribution of the
weight of the loan and
tom velie was not noted
for his lavishness in
praise 

  olive said velie let
me present mr roger bol-
ton who has gone far be-
yond the a b c of bank-
ing

  roger looking up be-
held a girl somewhat
above medium height dark
haired and altogether
lovely he noticed that
hpr bare arms were per-
fectly formed her teeth
showing through a very
gracious smile as she acknowledged the introduction
apparently both young people recognized an immediate
kinship

  father she said we have no engagements this
evening mr bolton if he has the leisure might stop
with us to dinner

  bolton naturally accepted they went to the
theatre came home and found something to talk about
until one in the morning for six months much of
the young mans spare time was spent at the velie
residence or accompanying olive to one function or
another they were soon engaged but their marriage

was placed in the indefinite future because bolton re-
garded  a year as a poor match for the velie
millions

  this is how matters stood on the day the people of
houston congregated about the castile bank and trust
companys twelve story building in the interval be-
tween the placing of the  in the safe and
boltons return the following morning the entire sum
had disappeared this mony was in notes but by
some curious oversight the sum of  in gold
which was not part of the molgravian loan had not
been touched bolton dumbfounded could not even
suggest an explanation indeed his sudden look of
terror so far from his ordinary bearing of cool cour-
age at once gave rise to sinister suspicion

  the safe which had recently been installed remained
to all appearances exactly as it had been the previous
afternoon but the money was gone the police im-
mediately began an inquisition of banks and clerks

  five clerks and tellers were positive they had seen
bolton place the money in the safe and set the com-
bination no alarm had been sounded during the
night nothing indicated that the safe had been
broken into nothing had been disturbed in the bank
it seemed obvious that bolton had placed only a few pack-
ages in the safe and had secreted the  some-
where during the night and as bolton offered no ex-
planation he was placed under arrest
the citizens who had almost idolized this young
man who had made such rapid strides under their
very observation were immediately convinced they had
been nursing a viper and the downcast bolton was
greeted with jeers as a patrol wagon carried him to
headquarters for a severe grilling which involved end-
less repetition of the never ending query-

  what have you done with the loot

  olive velie after a night of rosy dreams for the
future in which bolton was steadily rising in the
financial world awoke to a rude disenchantment
when she saw a copy of the houston globe a photo-
graph of her sweetheart gazed at her beneath a
streamer which announced houstons most promi-
nent banker arrested roger bolton charged with

 theft

  old tom velie caught
the headlines at the break-
fast table

  well he cried im
damned if i would ever
have believed that of him
crazy suicidal mania that
was why the young fool
if he wanted  to
get married on i would
have settled it on you both
any time and he knew it
oh father dont talk
so said olive you
dont imagine for a mo-
ment he took all that
money do you

  it looks mighty bad
he was the only one who
handled the money the money is gone the safe
hasnt been opened i will get the best counsel i can
for him though

  well unless he admits it himself i will never be-
lieve he did anything so idiotic the moment the in-
vestigation is over i am going to him god knows he
probably will be half tortured to death before we get
to see him said olive

  in the meantime the police officials of houston
eager to add to their laurels were putting roger
through that refined process known as the third de-
gree the examination was conducted in a corner of

on the

 rjlhere are more ways than one to kill a
     cat this we all know and there are more
    ways than one thanlcs to physics to open
    up a safe even if it doesnt look as though
    it had been opened and  are miss-
    ing many things are possible today that
    were impossible some years back of
    course we admit too that the recipe
    which the author gives here might furnish
    valuable information to safe-crackers and
    bank robbers-maybe at any rate the
    atomic riddle makes an interesting
    twenty minutes reading that keeps you
    guessing to the end


amazing stories quarterly

one of the big rooms of the prison office a light was
shining directly into his eyes all about him were
grouped officers in uniform and one or two in plain
clothes there was no cruelty simply the same end-
less repetition of the same monotonous questions

  come clean now roger where is the money
or

  who else was in on this who took the money
away and the like

  to all these questions roger replied that he was as
much mystified as they

  now this investigation brought out two additional
clues

  a new night watchman who had come highly rec-
ommended but a few months before disappeared the
day after rogers arrest an assistant cashier coming
from another city but whose credentials had seemed
to be good was also missing naturally it was as-
sumed they were rogers accomplices

  therefore as a welcome relief to the same endless
question roger was asked from time to time   

  where is the watchman or where is the assis-
tant cashier

  roger stood the ordeal well finally to bring the
inquiry to some kind of coherence the officers let new
york counsel selected by tom velie visit him they
installed dictaphones in order to record any slip roger
might make while he was being interviewed but it
was hopeless he would only say   

  i know nothing at all about the robbery i am as
amazed as you are if i could explain it i would do
so gladly

  willoughby the lawyer an ex-prosecutor who had
resumed practice at the bar reported to velie and
olive in a tremendous rage

  how can i help that young fool if he wont take
me into his confidence he simply repeats over and
over again that he knows nothing about it

  well if he knows anything about it i am going to
get it out of him for my own satisfaction exclaimed
olive i know roger is incapable of anything dis-
honorable he knows i would wash my hands of him
in a second if he ever stooped to anything so low he
is probably so excited by this time that he doesnt
know what he is saying

  olive ordered the car and told the chauffeur to let no
grass grow under the wheels on the road to houston
the prison officials willingly let her visit roger in his
cell eavesdropping on every word that passed

  roger she greeted him cant you think how that
money got away from you

  for all this brusque greeting she embraced him
with all the faith and fervor in the world

  you darling said roger with the first hopeful
note for a week in his voice if you had thought me
guilty i would almost have believed it myself

  now tell me all about the afternoon when you
locked the safe roger you were with me last thurs-
day night the night before the money disappeared
lets see you took dinner with us now taking an
hour and a half to drive over to houston that gave
you just about time enough to dress for dinner de-
scribe how you put the money away your lawyer
must have something to work on you know

  this conversation delighted the listening police and
detectives who were taking notes at high speed hav-
ing decided that roger was guilty all these details
had been overlooked or left for the future

  thursday afternoon my last day at the bank
said roger our new safe had just been installed in
the vault was the bulk of the money the bank kept
on hand but in this new safe i placed  the
amount of our subscription to the molgravian loan-
our proportion of their new  issue floated

through new york banks with your fathers aid this
was classified into denominations and each package
carefully marked with the amount in each in a steel
box in the same safe was  in gold i wonder
if that is gone too

  it is not said olive that makes it all the more
suspicious for you but dont worry what did you
know of those two men who are missing

  very little the president of the bank mr briscoe
said they came to him highly recommended lawson
the assistant cashier knew all about foreign loans
his accent however made me suspect that lawson
was not his real name then he was so much above
his position he was of slight physique machine-like
in his mind his memory was prodigious his eyes
never wavered just looked right through you the
watchman was not a houston man but evidently had
had experience in guarding banks i never said more
than how do you do to him

  well you have told me some things the lawyer
couldnt get out of you and that will help some now
roger dont lose your head and dont worry if i am
not over to see you again for awhile

  she held him in a kind of motherly embrace for a
moment and left the prison when she reached new
york olive went straight to mr willoughby with her
story

  not much in that miss velie he said but where
we are certain our client is innocent it is a great
help so far the only proof of boltons guilt is the
fact that the money has disappeared and that is
pretty nearly enough to convict whatever you can
do from now on miss velie will not be too much

the castile bank and trust company carried both
burglary insurance and protection against em-
bezzlement in addition to this roger was bonded in
the sum of  consequently these two insur-
ance companies at once set their sleuths on the trail
of the missing money after one week of investiga-
tion they were just where they had started roger
was arraigned and charged with the embezzlement of
 from the castile bank and trust company

  houston officials called on inspector craven of the
new york police department to look into the robbery
if the money could be recovered and the guilty brought
to justice inspector craven was the man to do it
combined with bulldog tenacity his keenness and the
knowledge of how criminal minds worked was his re-
markable intelligence in finding a motive for the most
mysterious underworld blows at society a friend of
tom velie he discussed the robbery with him before
visiting houston though reluctant to jump at con-
clusions inspector craven said frankly it looked pretty
bad for roger bolton nor was he less frank with
roger himself whtfn he saw that far from cheerful
young man

  mr bolton he began i am familiar with the
facts as far as they are known what i want you to
do is to offer me some theory or point to some person
other than yourself who might have opened that safe
taken the money out and set the combination again
inspector craven bolton replied to accuse any-
one else is entirely beyond me not even the president
of the bank knew the combination to that safe that
was my own responsibility the combination was in
my head no one could have read it for it was never
written either there is a way to open that safe
without knowing the combination impossible in my
opinion or the money went through the walls of the
safe which is equally impossible

  well mr bolton said inspector craven rising
if you intend to make that statement to a jury you
may as well prepare to spend the next few years of
the atomic riddle



your life in prison if the sum of  in gold had
not remained in the safe i should almost adopt the
theory that the safe had been removed and another
substituted in its place that is as fantastic as your
supposition that the money walked through the walls
of the safe knowing you and tom velie and es-
pecially miss olive velie i accept for the moment at
least your pleas of innocence perhaps after i have
examined the safe i may change my opinion good
bye

  from the prison inspector craven walked the short
distance to the castile bank and trust company mr
briscoe came at once to greet him

  how do you do inspector he said come right
in i suppose you want to look around

  yes mr briscoe is the safe about as it was the
night of the robbery

  it has not been touched i have never heard of
anything quite so mysterious we have audited bol-

vn sstris jnordufcm	s	ts

                          repetition oi the same monotonous questions

tons account and there is not the slightest suspicion
of irregularity of course two employes have disap-
peared but neither the assistant cashier nor the
watchman knew the combination then too there was
absolutely no sign of any disturbance

  he led the way to the safe it was not specially
large but was formidable looking nevertheless the
door was about five feet high with a combination
lock of respectable size it stood to the rear of the
bank with one side exposed and another set in an
alcove inspector craven examined the exterior and
used his microscope from time to time but said
nothing the interior of the safe revealed little
everything was as it had been the night the money
disappeared

  when the inspector reached headquarters in new

money he would have betrayed himself in some way
unless he was a hardened crook which of course i do
not for a moment believe

  what can we do inspector isnt there a man
skilled in safes and combinations isnt there someone
among the manufacturers of safes who could imagine
a way the safe could have been robbed

  i thought of that miss olvie i consulted some
of them and they say roger must be guilty i even
wrote a letter to a friend of mine who has a most un-
usual thinking apparatus which has often turned my
theories into ridicule but he is down in new orleans
now a guest of the southern medical association and
will be there a week longer by that time roger may
be so deeply involved that it will be impossible to help
him would you like to go to new orleans with your

york he found olive velie waiting in his office

  i heard that you had gone to houston inspector
she said did you find anything encouraging

  well miss velie there is one chance in a million
that the money was put in the safe as roger bolton
says and that it was taken out how that could be
done is too deep for me can you imagine how the
walls of a safe could remain intact after having been
opened to permit the removal of  and yet leave
not a trace it is not the very best safe in the world
a good yeggman could cut that door out in about ten
minutes with an oxyacetylene torch but he could not
leave it intact there are no finger prints but mod-
ern crooks no longer leave finger prints their pres-
ence would tell us something but their absence means
little frankly miss olive as things stand at present
i should do exactly what the police of houston have
done i should place roger bolton under arrest still
i must admit that if he knew anything about the

father on the chance that dr jarvis might be able to
help

  id take any chance said olive but father need
not go i am quite capable of taking care of myself
will you give me a letter to your friend

  certainly miss roberts he called to his secre-
tary kindly take this letter

dr milton jarvis

  magnolia hotel

    new orleans la

my dear dr jarvis

  the bearer of this letter miss olive velie is the
daughter of mr tom velie one of our leading finan-
ciers who is of course well known to you she will
explain her problem to you a problem whose solution
i freely confess is beyond me  has been taken
from a safe in the castile bank and trust company
if miss velies fianc is to be credited by burglars of
such skill that they have left no trace of their presence
on the safe now how can  be taken through
steel walls of ample thickness without leaving a clue
unless some one figures out how this can be done
roger bolton is likely to do a stretch in the pen and
i may have to help send him there this is not a med-
ical problem but you keep up with science so much
that i wondered if you could help in this case

  sincerely yours

craven police inspector

  the one night she passed on the train was a sleep-
less one yet before she had given way to despair or
had conjured up a happier vision the train was cross-
ing the bridge over lake pontchartrain and she was in
new orleans at the magnolia hotel she learned
doctor jarvis had gone to touro infirmary to deliver
a lecture at ten-thirty as it was but nine olive had
a short time for primping before going out to pry-
tan ia avenue where the infirmary is located she
had just settled in her chair in the large auditorium
when the president of the medical association intro-
duced dr milton jarvis

  olive peered curiously at this man of whom she ex-
pected so much he was rather tall very straight
slim with piercing dark eyes his clothing was quite
in the mode but cut to the figure so that his extreme
muscular development was apparent neither his
clothing nor his build attracted her attention so much
as the extreme intelligence of his face however his
eyes were knowing his lips firm he did not seem to
be the man who would take contradiction patiently

  dr jarvis opened his talk with comments on a lec-
ture given by one of the prominent members of the
association the previous evening this lecture it
seemed had to do with pyloric ulcers he reviewed
for the benefit of the nurses the various forms of
treatment first an operation by which the pylorus
was severed at its junction with the stomach the of-
fending lesion cut off and the end of the pylorus re-
attached to its host this he described as a pretty
serious remedy then he spoke of the various diets
which either irritated the sore spot or soothed it

  even to so alert and intelligent a girl as olive such
a topic would have proved a severe trial under ordin-
ary circumstances but tom velies sister anne
rounsaville the widow of a french diplomat was a
woman who for the last ten years of her bereave-
ment divided her affections equally between a bad tem-
pered fox terrier and a pyloric ulcer as olive had
borne patiently with all her symptoms she was the old
ladys favorite anne rounsaville having an analytical
temperament recounted to olive at every visit the pre-
cise effect of soft food of course breads of acids of
bases and what not on her pet ailment

  hence dr jarvis was treading familiar ground in
discussing the various phases of this all too common
ailment it was a great disappointment to anne
rounsaville that an attack of pneumonia proved fatal
and all her worry over the pyloric ulcer went for
naught but gratitude for olives patience as a list-
ener led her aunt to leave her a fortune of more than
half a million

then he had discussed topics purely medical for
vv some time dr jarvis reverted to biology and
chemistry of which he spoke like a man riding a
hobby

  you must know he said that not only in old
ruins and yellowed parchments can be traced the his-
tory of man but in the strata or successive levels of
the earth we can likewise trace the history of the
elements what we call matter has an appearance of
life take so common a thing as ammonia for ex-
ample it may be placed in combinations that serve
as food and enter into our bodies as part of living
organisms it may be left in another state and be-
come fuel atoms molecules colloids all have their
histories and all have been modified with time fund-
amentally we are near the conclusion that the hydrogen
atom and beyond it the hydrogen electrons and pro-
tons are elemental if hydrogen is at the basis of all
other atoms except that there are more electrons in
one than in the other what is the difference between
the hydrogen electrons in vegetable tissue and those
which enter into material in a skyscraper simply a
difference in the number and arrangement of electrons
about the nucleus containing the same number of
protons

  so the barrier between the vegetable world and the
animal world or the mineral world which in all the
old books was so sharply defined that they were
classed belonging forever to separate worlds has been
torn down

  our reason in medicine as everywhere is our best
guide formerly it was all a matter of materia medica
and knowing your formulae but now it is different
suppose you nurses were watching a patient who
showed a surprisingly high blood count suppose that
instead of the customary  or  leucocytes
you found that the patients blood had  or
 you would at once conclude that the patient
was suffering to use  popular term from malignant
anaemia

  suppose a doctor of wide experience were called
upon to testify in court in a case against an insurance
company where several people in the same neighbor-
hood of a large city simultaneously displayed a similar
activity of white corpuscles one patient would get
down with apparent anaemia and the insurance com-
pany would be called upon to pay a stated weekly sum
on an insurance policy fifteen or twenty people so
afflicted would make enough inroads on the insurance
company funds to inspire an investigation

  in such a case reason would tell you that it was
extremely improbable that fifteen people in one neigh-
borhood would so suffer then it would occur to you
that something besides anaemia could produce a sud-
den increase in the blood count if you remembered
your studies you would at once conclude as i did an
injection of peptones or nucleins would increase the
count of leucocytes

  that is exactly what had taken place the neigh-
borhood was notorious for fraudulent street car ac-
cidents and these it was found were due to the ac-
tivity of a number of acrobats who could dislocate
arms and legs at will and simulate at will a terrible
fall with the utmost realism so we exposed the fraud
and the people who were apparently suffering from
the atomic riddle

-

  anaemia because of an injection of peptones admin-
istered by an unscrupulous physician who had been
disciplined for malpractice

  i talk to you of these removed topics to remind you
young people that whatever your profession your rea-
son is what distinguishes you from all other qualities
of the animals memory does not so distinguish us
for an elephant will remember when man has for-
gotten

  when i was younger the study of amoeba the one-
celled organism which could move and reproduce by
subdividing seemed to me the most useless thing one
could imagine but when we examine a drop of blood
and see the amoeba like phagocytes surrounding their
prey the disease germ on which they feed the amoeba
in our own systems acquires the interesting relation
of an important part of our being

  as olive strove to understand this intricate talk
some gleam of hope shot through her mind if as the
doctor asserted there was no fundamental difference
between the matter in a plant and a skyscraper why
should there be any impossibility if you had the right
philosophy or the right science involved in drawing
bank notes through the walls of a safe she grew more
confident that dr jarvis of all others might perhaps
find an answer to her enigma after the lecture was
over she waited until the various doctors and nurses
had spoken to him she addressed him as he was turn-
ing to leave the hall

  dr jarvis she said i am olive velie i have
come all the way from new york to see if you could
help us inspector craven said if anyone could solve
our mystery you could

  after reading the inspectors letter dr jarvis said
a bolton rob a bank absurd of course the safe
was opened and inspector craven says the robbers
left no traces now what traces did he look for
muddy footprints a series of easily read finger
prints a combination broken with a sledge hammer

i	should be jumping at conclusions if i theorized with-
out seeing the safe but i am a doctor i deal with
ailments of the body not with bank vaults and safes
oh but doctor cried olive the inspector says it
may be some freak of science and that it baffles him
he believed you could suggest some key to the mys-
stery

  well miss olive there is but one answer to such
blind and flattering confidence the principal work of
the medical conference is over so i will make my
adieux and return to new york with you

  on the train coming back olive velie told dr
jarvis all she knew of the situation

  well i am taking your word for it that roger is
innocent dr jarvis said when she had finished if
he is certainly the money did not walk away if it is
gone someone took it these officials see only what is
before their eyes why just from what you have told
me i can surmise some factors they have overlooked

i	know the details in a general way as the papers
gave them the picayune had a good story about it
one thing strikes me now isnt it peculiar that rob-
bers if they were ordinary robbers ignored 
in gold which they could have had easily enough
the money which has been taken from the safe is
part of a foreign loan who would be interested in
preventing a foreign loan people obviously who were
either preparing a royalist coup or those who were
against all capital they might be both scientists and
crooks or they might be fanatics who imagined that
they were destined to rescue mankind from capitalistic
woes either real or fancied if they had brains enough
to conceive a plot to defeat such a loan would they
leave traces of their exploit not very obvious ones
you may be sure you said communists are active in

molgravia if we knew something of the state of af-
fairs there it might afford us a clue as soon as we
return you go to the newspaper morgue and get me
what information you can on conditions in molgravia
for the past year

  dr jarvis cried olive ill do just as you say
for i know of no one who can help us but yourself

  well see but let me caution you do not write
that you have seen me do not tell anyone that i am
interested the men who planned this robbery if any-
one did plan it would not stop at anything so you
must not give them any ground for suspicion i feel
reasonably sure they have given no thought to de-
tection if the theory forming in my mind is correct
their plan was so diabolically cunning that few men
would suspect a robbery

  how this restriction not to write ate into olives
heart may well be imagined but his command to in-
vestigate events in molgravia gave her something to
occupy her mind

  you have heard dr jarvis had said in the big
convention hall the phrase beware of the man of
one book but i should say beware of the man who
knows only one book well and many other books pass-
ing well a broad general knowledge is essential in
any profession and lack of general attainments is a
handicap to success in medicine as in all other pro-
fessions

  this man thought olive to herself must already
have reached a solution of the safe robbery and he
was a famous physician and surgeon not a famous
detective but she thought again acute brains are
found in all ranks of mankind and much good phil-
osophy may be expounded by a straight thinking un-
educated farmer

pp vents began to happen with the arrival of doc-
tor jarvis in new york two days later in the
morning he walked to his garage and opened the door
as he threw it open the odor of gasoline was un-
usually strong this struck him as peculiar as he
opened the door of his car a coupe the odor became
very powerful his eyes being observant dr jarvis
noted that the floor boards were not quite even with
a pair of pliers he raised the floor boards beneath
was the battery in its metal case following the odor
of gasoline he saw that the battery box was filled with
gasoline the long thick cable which led to the starter
was resting clear of the battery box but any motion
of the car would throw it against the metal box

  now what would happen the doctor asked him-
self if that cable were short circuited and sparked at
the point of contact with the box it would be a good
fat spark and with the gas vapor confined there would
be a powerful explosion the least i could hope for
would be a few weeks in the hospital

  he thanked his lucky stars that the leak of gas had
occurred just a few weeks after he had installed a new
cable but he lifted the cable clear very gingerly
then he discovered that within the metal shield the
insulation of the wire had been cut away for a foot
along the cable the moment he would have started the
car the cable would have been jarred to the metal box
there would have been a short circuit and an explosion
that might have had any imaginable result

  this incident set the doctor to thinking with a
cord he tied up the cable to prevent it from making
a contact with a large sponge he began to remove
the gasoline from the box when this task was com-
pleted he unscrewed the cable at the positive pole to
render it harmless that his theory of the bank rob-
bery was the correct one he now had no doubt his
arrival in new york had been transmitted to the ring-
leaders who feared what he might discover to allay


amazing stories quarterly

their fears therefore he decided to make no visit to
the castile bank and trust company at houston
there was but one possible solution of the robbery
his first duty was to report to the inspector the at-
tempt to wound or kill him and put that official on his
guard

  returning to his chambers he called for inspector
craven when he heard cravens voice he said

  im coming to see you in a taxi inspector he said
just had an accident to my car it nearly blew up
accident hell said the inspector wait till you
get here i had one of those accidents too

  when dr jarvis reached headquarters he found the
inspector somewhat excited

  doc he cried some poor devil probably a car
thief broke into my garage early this morning when
he put his foot on the starter she blew up and he was
killed i investigated the thing myself a decent sized
stick of dynamite with a percussion cap had been
wedged under the starter chain the moment the
starter moved off she went did your car have dyna-
mite too

  no mine was not so deadly but just as complete
my wiring system had the insulation cut i might have
been maimed or killed if i had not discovered it i
believe our houston bank robbers are opening war
what exploded inspector craven do you think
young bolton is at the head of a gang of bank rob-
bers

  what nonsense the papers which i read gave all
the numbers on the stolen certificates have any of
these bills been offered to any bank hotel or mer-
chant if my supposition is correct they have not
none have been reported to the police at any
rate said the inspector whose curiosity was aroused
do you mean to say that without having been to the
bank you have already arrived at a theory of how the
money disappeared

  after the events of this morning i have no doubt
whatever if you have enough confidence in my judg-
ment i will tell you how we can arrive at a solution
of the mystery if i am wrong the right man is in
jail

  ill be glad to do anything that looks like a show
of activity

  no one suspects now that i have a clue as i have
not been in new york and have had no opportunity
to go over the ground said the doctor if i go to
the bank now it would indicate that i hoped to find
one let us arrange a meeting at the castile bank and
trust company offices tomorrow night when it will
attract least attention it will be after banking hours
and we shall not be interrupted we will need a few
supers however

  at the molgravian communist headquarters in new
york you will find some emissary of the communist
leader serge malakieff or perhaps one of his labora-
tory assistants he will be an intellectual man prob-
ably too not very robust physically invite him to
meet us there tomorrow night any form of invitation
will bring him i am sure next you must find the
most skilful burglar now at liberty he is one who
operates with uncanny cleverness he uses a torch
it is either oxyhydrogen or oxyacetylene but he
never makes jagged holes his safes are opened in
either a perfect circle or a perfect ellipse

  by heaven doc you must have been looking over
our gallery that is a good description of frenchy
vergoynes method but he is doing a stretch for
that new brunswick robbery unless he was pardoned
or paroled within the last two weeks i must look
him up and arrest him if he is at liberty

  if he is free learn if he knows any good safe-
painters who handle quick dryers if there are any

unusually good machinists or metal workers at com-
munist headquarters you might invite them up too
i think about five men carried out the robbery per-
haps more if as i anticipate these men attend the
lecture i propose to give i will show you tomorrow
night how the safe was robbed perhaps you can re-
cover the money however that is a police matter in
which i am not interested

  doctor jarvis then shook hands with inspector
craven and walked off to a consultation on x-ray
treatments as if the matter had been finally settled
leaving inspector craven staring open mouthed as he
passed out the door

  he was half inclined to prevent himself going into
so hairbrained a scheme by calling the doctor on the
telephone and dropping the investigation the doctor
had not seen the bank nor the safe nor even young
bolton but looking over the memoranda on his desk
he saw one item that had been placed there this very
morning it stated that frenchy vergoyne had been
released on parole by the governor three weeks pre-
viously it seemed he had a war record

  the inspector immediately set his men on the burg-
lars trail he was arrested as he stepped on a train-
bound west although he had been doing apparently
nothing he was very well provided with funds

  well chief he said with a shade of defiance
whats your charge

  no charge at all frenchy said the inspector
we want you to tell us how a safe can be cracked
just a sort of witness for the present get a lawyer
if you like but i have no charge

  frenchy much mystified was given a comfortable
guest room with everything at his command except
liberty he decided not to call for a lawyer

  inspector craven feeling worried now consulted the
district attorney mr glover being a new york of-
ficial and not likely to serve on the case against
bolton if it ever came up took a liberal view of the
situation

  what have you done after all except detain
frenchy as a witness if frenchy afterwards sues for
damages to his character or reputation what good do
you suppose it would do him i believe this doctor
is a clever guesser and if he guesses anything else
than that young bolton took the money i will buy
you a good dinner

  when on his return to his office inspector craven
found olive velie on the telephone he was in a peev-
ish humor

  what can i do for you miss velie he asked
  have you learned anything about the robbery

  i cant say that i have he said sourly enough
doctor jarvis has persuaded me to call a meeting at
the bank in houston tomorrow night at eight oclock
you can be there if you like the doctor has under-
taken to persuade houston officials to have mr bolton
there too i have arrested a poor innocent burglar
for nothing at all and what his lawyers will do to
me will be plenty then he babbled innocently about
some painter friends of his and i have invited a few
molgravian communists to attend what seems to be a
scientific lecture the doctor wants to give i really be-
lieve he has lost his mind

  how droll you are inspector said olive with a
laugh i am so glad it is all over i will be there
you may be sure

inspector cravens worst fears were realized
the following night when accompanied by two men
of his staff he went with the marvelling frenchy to
the castile bank and trust company three rows of
chairs had been placed in the space back of the tell-
ers cages and immediately to the front of the safe
the atomic riddle



which had been robbed near the safe the doctor
had placed a large blackboard

  as they entered the building he saw a knot of mol-
gravian communists in animated conversation they
smiled as he entered the bank mr briscoe the pres-
ident of the bank was there roger was there
guarded by two officers dr jarvis was standing be-
fore his blackboard there were four other individ-
uals molgravians in the room besides frenchy

  tom velie had insisted on accompanying olive to
the demonstration he expected to witness a farce
when he saw the blackboard he yawned dr jarvis
was perhaps the only one with the exception of the
molgravians who was unmoved frenchy vergoyne
returned the doctors inspection with contempt he
was the professional type this burglar huge hulk-
ing in body about thirty-five heavy jowled cold of
eye vergoyne did not lack intelligence his lips closed
tightly indicating habitual reticence

  two of the molgravians were more interesting
one doctor jarvis noted was a short thick set man
with dark curly hair his face was bronzed and in-
telligent but with an unmistakable air of the crafts-
man his hands were calloused while around the
nails could be seen scars of all kinds from cuts or
bruises made by metals or tools this molgravian
bore the americanized name of grant smith

  the other molgravian who attracted the doctors
attention met his eye with easy assurance in phys-
ique he was frail his shoulders narrow he might be
suspected of weak lungs but the intellectual in his
face was so marked that doctor jarvis started on
his wrists doctor jarvis an expert in all kinds of
scientific apparatus noted brown stains in another
man he would have said they were signs of a dis-
ordered liver but from his own experience he rec-
ognized them for what they were-x-ray burns this
man was known as carlino angulescu

  angulescus forehead was somewhat rounded his
brown eyes glowed with a light of self-sufficiency so
great that it held an assumption of regal or celestial
scorn the aquiline nose finely designed face finely
moulded convinced the doctor that if he sought an
unusual being among the molgravians he need search
no further

  seeing everyone looking expectantly at him doctor
jarvis took his station before the blackboard

  miss velie and gentlemen he said including even
frenchy vergoyne in his bow i shall be as brief as
possible in discussing the intricate matters which
bring us together i shall have to indulge in some
political speculation which is far indeed from my
natural bent

  now this  robbery laid at the door of a
young man who had nothing to gain and all to lose
by such an act seems to be nothing but a simple
breach of trust but if young bolton took the money
why did he not take all i learned that the money
stolen was part of a sum intended to make up the new
molgravian loan which was recently financed in
america so i asked myself would anyone desire to
prevent the financing of the molgravian loan

  it seemed to me that if there was any definite
movement against the rulers of molgravia it might
furnish a motive i found stories of a strong com-
munistic movement there with an active propaganda
in the united states

  having found a motive which might induce cer-
tain individuals to go to great lengths to prevent fin-
ancing a loan which would materially increase the
power and prestige of the royal house there was a
strange problem to solve how could anyone but bolton
open the safe and leave no trace of having opened it

  discarding the extreme improbability that bolton

was the guilty man i considered the surroundings
item one a new safe item two  taken
 in gold left item three  was the
share of the banks molgravian loan finally i
reached the extremely bizarre conclusion that the safe
had been opened the money taken out and the safe
closed again

  in order to make clear how this was done i shall
have to go over some facts and theories of elemental
chemistry and physics

  a look of incredulity appeared on the face of in-
spector craven he pinched himself the doctor evi-
dently had started no farce was he fool enough to
think a lecture on chemistry would solve a safe rob-
bery he was on the point of walking out but re-
called a few other lectures by dr jarvis and stayed
bolton was all ears olive was following every word
tom velie was nodding

  first of all we must talk about two elements
hydrogen and oxygen you may recall some of you if
you read what scientists are doing that several years
ago when these two elements were first liquefied the
greatest handicaps were in finding pressures enormous
enough to produce liquefaction what they finally dis-
covered was this the gases themselves will contribute
to their own liquefaction if sealed hermetically in the
instrument or vessel the hydrogen or oxygen gas on
being heated will expand until it finally exerts suf-
ficient pressure for some of the gas to liquefy

  now i must describe briefly the nature of hydro-
gen it commonly exists in the molecular state two
atoms make up this molecule each atom has one
proton and one electron the proton carrying a pos-
itive charge of electricity and the electron a negative
charge to break up this molecule of hydrogen into
two atoms the scientist langmuir calculated would
require an energy of  calories or sufficient to
increase the temperature of the gas to  degrees
fahrenheit-far more than the heat of the sun

  the scientists could not accumulate so much energy
or heat and bring it to bear on the hydrogen mole-
cules but remember this all forms of energy are in-
terchangeable you turn a button in your kitchen and
your electricity becomes heat you push another but-
ton and your electricity becomes light you fire a
boiler run a dynamo and heat becomes electricity in
the various forms of light there are varying forms of
energy in fact the modern idea of light is that it is
composed of bundles of energy the different forms
of light correspond to various forms and quantities
of energy

  in the ultra-violet light waves for instance was
found the energy corresponding to the  calories
which was the amount estimated necessary to break up
the hydrogen molecule but hydrogen is immune to the
influence of such light

  inspector craven was preparing to join tom velie in
his soothing nap when he observed the molgravian
carlino angulesu as doctor jarvis began to comment
on the nature of the hydrogen molecule his face lost
its disdainful look and he bent forward that he might
lose not a syllable if this molgravian saw something
in the doctors crazy talk the inspector thought he
might at least try to follow it but he glanced from
time to time at the molgravian whose interest seemed
to grow rather than wane

  if continued dr jarvis the immunity of the
hydrogen molecule to the influence of the ultra-violet
rays could not be broken then one very promising
method of obtaining atmoic hydrogen would have been
in vain but other elements do not share the immunity
of hydrogen mercury vapor absorbs ultra-violet light
very readily the problem therefore became simpler
why not load mercury atoms with ultra-violet light

and bombard the hydrogen molecule with them the
mercury atom which has absorbed ultra-violet light is
called an excited mercury atom and these mercury
atoms even in the proportion- of one to ten thousand
in a gas mixture will become excited with sufficient
ultra-violet light waves to make the equivalent of

	calories in energy which is  more than
the  needed to dissolve the union of the two
atoms in the hydrogen molecule now if a quantity of
these excited mercury atoms is introduced into an
atmosphere of molecular hydrogen a number of col-
lisions will take place the excited mercury atoms will
strike the hydrogen molecule and its  calories
of ultra-violet energy will be exerted against the hy-
drogen molecule the energy is sufficient to cause the
two atoms of hydrogen to fly apart and the mercury
atom having given up its energy is no longer excited
the action is like this here dr jarvis drew a
couple of diagrams on the blackboard

wou will wonder at once what good is accom-
i plished by this dissolution of the hydrogen
molecule well first of all it makes available the
enormous energy in heat of  calories for if
we expand  calories to break up the hydrogen
molecule when the atoms come together again we get
our  calories of heat back if we have a suf-
ficient number of these atoms we can get a heat far
beyond that produced by any appliance now known

  we have gone even further than this hydrogen
ions or protons exist in sulphuric acid when they
meet the electrons of which the electric current is
composed in a sulphuric acid solution the electrons
join the ions or protons and we see hydrogen atoms
in the making

  atmoic hydrogen is much more active than mole-
cular hydrogen and if we can find a means of using
the  calories of heat developed every time two
hydrogen atoms unite to form a molecule we should
have something very useful indeed in such a process
for example as welding now miss velie if you will
awaken your father the rest of the demonstration
will interest him

  velie was awakened and the doctor resumed his
lecture angulescu seemed absorbedly interested
which served to keep the inspector awake

  as ultra-violet rays are not easy to handle com-
mercially atomic hydrogen for welding can be pro-
cured in another way if molecular hydrogen is
passed into a powerful electric arc between tungsten
electrodes it will be broken up into atoms these
coming out of the arc as they burn into the molecular
form again generate heat almost double that of the
oxyhydrogen flame knowing this the use of hydro-
gen atoms in welding becomes a certainty

  all other welding is subject to what are known as
fluxes from oxidation at the point of welding now
why do we talk of welding by means of hydrogen
atoms when we are seeking to unravel a bank rob-
bery i will show you very speedily i have had the
paint cleared from one side of this safe inspector
craven will you be good enough to examine the side
which was cleaned

  the inspector looked at the side of the safe and
gave a low whistle of astonishment in a perfect
circle about the middle of this wall of the safe the
metal showed the mark of some kind of tampering
apparently the metal had been cut with a tool of
some kind and sealed shut with another tool a band
of a different color stood between the outer and the
inner lines of the cut

  what does it mean doc asked the inspector
gaping with astonishment

  it means just this my friends said doctor jarvis
a hole was cut into the side of this safe and sealed
shut i believe we shall find another cut in the roof
of the safe the inside of that hole could not be
sealed so well but very few people would think of
looking at the roof of the safe for an opening it is
considered a negligible matter

  the door of the safe swung open when a light
was thrown on the inside roof of the safe there sure
enough was the same sort of circular mark in the
metal as was seen on the side of the safe

  everybody now became thoroughly absorbed olive
and roger exchanged a glance of mutual relief tom

velie rubbed his eyes saying well ill be d-d

inspector craven was in a fever of impatience did
that confounded doctor intend to lecture all night
and possibly let the robbers whoever they were es-
cape and what had become of the  after
everyone had looked curiously at the marks on the
safe doctor jarvis resumed

  i do not believe it is necessary for me to prove
further that this safe was opened on the night of the
mysterious disappearance of the  i shall pro-
ceed to tell you how it was opened and how it was so
effectively sealed shut that for ordinary purposes it would
not have been discovered until the bank removed it
and bought a new safe

  a band of several men entered the bank that night
they were equipped with oxyacetylene or oxyhydrogen
apparatus one of the men skilful in such work drew
a circle of the cut he proposed to make with his
torch he cut a disc in the side of the safe large
enough to admit the body of a man he performed the
same operationin the roof of the safe he beveled the
cut so that the disc would not fall from the roof into
the safe

  to answer possible objections i must assume at
once that it would have been easier to cut around
the combination but that would also have cut the
tumblers and they could not have been replaced havr
ing cut two regular holes in the safe the sum of
 in notes was taken out and  in gold
was ignored the next problem was to seal the two
holes shut so as to leave no obvious signs of the rob-
bery

  the robbers were provided with a quantity of
metal the disc which had been cut in the side of the
safe was first set in place a narrow band of metal
was missing where the tool had burned through with
a different kind of torch the most trained worker of
the robbers now proceeded to fuse sufficient new metal
to seal the opening into the space which had been cut
between the disc of metal and the wall of che safe
if only older methods of welding had been open to the
robbers their plan to conceal the robbery would have
the atomic riddle



been futile but by using activated or atomic hydro-
gen at the point of fusion or welding so great a
heat was developed that the skilled worker had little
difficulty in making a neat job of it when he had
smoothed it off there was practically no unevenness
on the surface of the safe the paint had been marred
of course but would such men be baffled by a paint
job

  now for a moment i must tax your patience with
a description of the instrument used for this purpose
it is a welding torch with tungsten electrodes ar-
ranged at an acute angle toward each other their
distance apart is regulated by pressing a lever set
in the handle of the torch the alternating current
from any socket would serve admirably for power
a tube passes through the handle and through this
tube flows a stream of hydrogen this stream of hy-
drogen passes through the electric arc and is reduced
to atoms passing through the arc it is in the atomic
state at the point of welding burning again to the
molecular state it generates a heat that will fuse any-
thing as the reducing action of this atomic hydrogen
is so powerful no carbon oxygen or nitrogen con-
tamination can occur the weld can be made as clean
and smooth as desired

  not to tire you further with occult science i will
simply state then that the inside and outside of the
safe were carefully sealed by means of this hydrogen
welding apparatus the workman who sealed the side
af the safe was then lifted from the interior by his
confederates they could do little with the inside of
the safe roof the outside however was sealed up

with care but who would look for safe-blowing at
the roof of the safe

  if my long explanation leads to the supposition
that all this requires much time inspector craven
will tell you that with the proper apparatus the holes
could be cut in a few minutes welding with atomic
hydrogen can be done at the rate of fifty or more feet
per hour while the explanation is involved the exe-
cution takes little time

  disgust was supreme on inspector cravens face
as this demonstration ended so far as he could see
all the doctor had shown was that there was a
method by which a hole could be cut in a safe and
the hole sealed up again the doctor seemed to read
his thoughts

  now that i have shown how this safe could have
been robbed my friend inspector craven is eager
for action but i am merely a scientific theorist and
must indulge my bent into the realm of politics i
thought the inspector would take the story up from
where i ended i know little of politics but when
several men take so much trouble to hide their handi-
work i reason there must be a correspondingly im-
portant motive

  the only money these robbers took from the safe
was  which formed part of a  loan
to molgravia holding up any part of the loan it is
true would be a temporary impediment but if this
robbery were not discovered a man of honor would
be accused of a breach of trust suppose the same
thing happened in new york and other large cities
where the majority of the loan was distributed a

the door of th safe swung open when a light was thrown on the in-
side roof of the safe there urcj enough was the same sort of circular
mark in the metal as seen on the side of the safe

dozen trusted cashiers would be placed in jail -
 would disappear and the molgravian govern-
ment would be discredited would that be worth a little
research into the realms of atomic hydrogen welding
the doctor may well be pardoned for the little ex-
ultation that appeared in his voice his reasoning had


amazing stories quarterly

been uncanny but the doctor had ignored one very
important factor the attempt on his automobile
should have taught him that men who plot schemes of
such magnitude are resourceful and desperate

put em up everybody

 a this command came in curt fierce tones from
frenchy vergoyne not being under arrest and being
a very accomplished criminal he had picked the
pockets of inspector craven and his two deputies re-
lieving them of their weapons and their watches two
of the pistols he now held in his hands now all of
you get over there he commanded and keep that
skirt in front of you if anyone makes a move she
will get it first in all this time since his imprison-
ment roger bolton had been unable to make one
move on his own behalf and at this critical moment
when those who had caused his disgrace seemed to
be near capture a determined and desperate burglar
dared to call the woman he loved a skirt it was en-
tirely too much for roger bolton

  roger made one fierce lunge at the burglar precisely
as he had been in the habit of charging the line in his
college football days before frenchy vergoyne knew
what was happening roger struck him like a catapult
he twisted the gun out of vergoynes right hand and
struck up the other the trigger fell but the bullet
struck the ceiling by this time inspector craven had
gotten into action and frenchy vergoyne was soon on
the floor inspector craven astride his chest with gun
in hand frenchy vergoyne d red not make a move
but in the confusion carlino angulescu grant smith
and two other molgravians dashed through the iron
mesh door which led from the rear of the tellers
cages closing it as they ran not daring to take his
eyes off frenchy inspector craven roared to his men

  follow them round them up before they get out of
houston

  then he turned to frenchy

  now frenchy he said with his gun to his pris-
oners face you or your gang killed one of our men
in that new brunswick robbery no matter how i kill
you there will be no blame attached to me all the
men on the force will see to that tell me where that
loot is or this gun will go off in a few seconds
frenchy did not want to die in a low voice he
told inspector craven that the sum of  in
notes was still intact under constant guard at an ad-
dress in new york

roger called the inspector keep this gun
trained on frenchy until i get a report if he is ly-
ing he wont have long to worry over his troubles
in a few seconds more inspector craven was tele-
phoning a police station near the new york address

  clancy he cried to the lieutenant who answered
the telephone take the riot car and ten men fully

armed to no-avenue you will find the loot from

the castile bank and trust company robbery there
if my information is correct phone me at the bank
the moment you verify this report

  within twenty minutes the telephone rang

r tello inspector called clancy we got the
money all right we had to kill a man who
tried to shoot us up were coming with the dough

  as soon as the inspector had announced this start-
ling piece of news the entire party including mr
briscoe joined in a prolonged hurrah

carlino angulescu and his companions had doubtless
safely gotten to new york frenchy vergoyne see-
ing that he was not kept under guard walked from
the room and resumed his journey to chicago
doctor said craven somewhat repentantly i

owe you an apology i thought you were so fond of
science that you had forgotten all about our safe rob-
bery you didnt mention it but i suppose they painted
over the place where they had cut the safe

  oh of course said the doctor that was a small
detail they had to repaint the entire surface of one
side of the safe but with a quick drying paint that
was a simple matter

  well said mr briscoe since the money has been
recovered and we know now who took it i think the
officers had better release roger bolton we owe him
all kinds of amends but what else could we do
when clancy had arrived with his men and the
stolen money inspector craven ordered two to remain
on guard until mr briscoe had decided on a proper
disposition of the fund

  dr jarvis cried mr briscoe as soon as the
money had been counted found intact and deposited in
the large vault in the basement the manner in which
you solved this intricate robbery is nothing short of
marvellous we have an ample surplus in the bank
and the insurance companies have offered a large re-
ward for the recovery of the stolen notes the re-
wards belong to you certainly

  mr briscoe replied the doctor diffidently to me
the whole affair was a scientific problem to be solved
as such my entire interest in this affair was due to
the confidence miss velie had in this young man and
her enthusiasm in my ability to help her i may say
that i count roger bolton a most fortunate man
olive blushed at this announcement but confirmed
the doctors opinion by pressing rogers arm which
had been locked in hers for some minutes tom velie
wide awake said

  doc the police force sure needs you if these burg-
lars are going in for invisible robberies how you got
at the thing without ever coming here when the police
had been over the ground with microscopes beats me
but you must take dinner with us sunday and explain
what i missed i am going to offer roger a better
job under my eye where i can look after my future
son-in-law and he had better set the date pretty soon
when they were married roger insisted that doctor
jarvis act as best man olive blushingly insists that
their first born whether boy or girl shall bear
jarvis as a middle name

  the large banks warned in time took precautions
that effectively prevented any further attack on the
molgravian loan inspector craven was offered a very
large reward which he at first refused to take but
when he found that doctor jarvis who was very well
off would have nothing to do with the reward he in-
formed the bankers how the method of this robbery
had been discovered with the aid of tom velie they
endowed a million dollar laboratory at one of the hos-
pitals placing a large income at the disposal of the
doctor for his experiments and researches

  carlino angulescu it was learned was none other
than the scientist serge malakieff who had devoted
his science to the cause of communism he wrote
doctor jarvis that he was prostituting his talents for
the benefit of capitalism a decision he might sometime
regret while the doctor recognized malakieffs great
ability he shrugged his shoulders at the notion of a
threat at the same time he received an invitation
from the molgravian government which had heard of
his achievement to address the international medical
association which was to meet in the molgravian
capital the following year he immediately set out for
his new laboratory where he decided that a talk on the
influence of ultra-violet rays on either delicata or
fibrous tissues would be highly interesting to the
molgravians

  isbister stopped abruptly no was all he said
but his bearing conveyed his helpful impulse

  it may sound incredible said the stranger turn-
ing weary eyes to isbisters face and emphasizing his
words with a languid hand but i have had no sleep-
no sleep at all for six nights

  had advice

  yes bad advice for the most part drugs my
nervous system   they are all very well for the
run of people its hard to explain i dare not take
   sufficiently powerful drugs

  that makes it difficult said isbister

  he stood helplessly in the narrow path perplexed
what to do clearly the man wanted to talk an idea
natural enough under the circumstances prompted him
to keep the conversation going ive never suffered
from sleeplessness myself he said in a tone of com-
monplace gossip but in those cases i have known peo-
ple have usually found something-

  i dare make no experiments

insomnia

afternoon at low water mr isbister a
young artist lodging at boscastle walked
from that place to the picturesque cove of
pentargen desiring to examine the caves
there halfway down the precipitous path
to the pentargen beach he came suddenly upon a man
sitting in an attitude of profound distress beneath a
projecting mass of rock the hands of this man hung
limply over his knees his eyes were red and staring be-
fore him and his face was wet with tears

  he glanced round at isbisters football both men
were disconcerted isbister the more so and to over-
ride the awkwardness of his involuntary pause he re-
marked with an air of mature conviction that the
weather was hot for the time of year

very answered the stranger shortly hesitated a
second and added in a colorless tone i cant sleep

  he spoke wearily he gave a gesture of rejection
and for a space both men were silent

  exercise suggested isbister diffidently with a
glance from his interlocutors face of wretchedness to
the touring costume he wore

  that is what i have tried unwisely perhaps i
have followed the coast day after day-from new quay
it has only added muscular fatigue to the mental the
cause of this unrest was overwork-trouble there was
something-

  he stopped as if from sheer fatigue he rubbed his
forehead with a lean hand he resumed speech like
one who talks to himself

  i am a lone wolf a solitary man wandering through
a world in which i have no part i am wifeless-child-
less-who is it speaks of the childless as the dead twigs
on the tree of life i am wifeless childless-i could
find no duty to do no desire even in my heart one
thing at last i set myself to do

   i said i will do this and to do it to overcome the iner-
tia of this dull body i resorted to drugs great god ive
had enough of drugs i dont know if you feel the
heavy inconvenience of the body its exasperating de-
mand of time from the mind-time-life live we
only live in patches we have to eat and then comes the
dull digestive complacencies-or irritations we have to
take the air or else our
thoughts grow sluggish stu-
pid run into gulfs and blind
alleys a thousand distrac-
tions arise from within and
without and then comes
drowsiness and sleep men
seem to live for sleep how
little of a mans day is his
own-even at the best and
then come those false friends
those thug helpers the alka-
loids that stifle natural fa-
tigue and kill rest-black
coffee cocaine-

  i see said isbister

  i did my work said the
sleepless man with a queru-
lous intonation

  and this is the price

  yes

  for a little while the
two remained without speak-
ing

  you can not imagine the
craving for rest that i feel-a
hunger and thirst for six
long days since my work was
done my mind has been a
whirlpool swift unprogres-
sive and incessant a torrent
of thoughts leading nowhere
spinning round swift and
steady-

  he paused towards the
gulf

  you must sleep said isbister decisively and with
an air of a remedy discovered certainly you must
sleep

  my mind is perfectly lucid it was never clearer
but i know i am drawing towards the vortex pres-
ently-

  yes

  you have seen things go down an eddy out of the
light of the day out of this sweet world of sanity-
down-

  but expostulated isbister

  the man threw out a hand towards him and his eyes
were wild and his voice suddenly high i shall kill
myself if in no other way-at the foot of yonder dark
precipice there where the waves are green and the
white surge lifts and falls and that little thread of
water trembles down there at any rate is   
sleep

  thats unreasonable said isbister startled at the
mans hysterical gust of emotion drugs are better
than that

  there at any rate is sleep repeated the stranger
not heeding him

  isbister looked at him and wondered transitorily if
some complex providence had indeed brought them to-
gether that afternoon its not certain you know he
remarked theres a cliff like that at lulworth cove-
as high anyhow-and a little girl fell from top to bot-
tom and lives today-sound and well

  but those rocks there

  one might lie on them rather dismally through a
cold night broken bones grating as one shivered chill
water splashing over you eh

  their eyes met sorry to upset your ideals said
isbister with a sense of devil-may-careish brilliance
but a suicide over that cliff or any cliff for the mat-
ter of that really as an artist- he laughed its
so damned amateurish

  but the other thing said
the sleepless man irritably
the other thing no man
can keep sane if night after
night-

  have you been walking
along this coast alone
yes

  silly sort of thing to do
if youll excuse my saying
so alone as you say
body fag is no cure for brain
fag who told you to no
wonder walking and the
sun on your head heat fag
solitude all the day long and
then i suppose you go to
bed and try very hard-eh
isbister stopped short and
looked at the sufferer doubt-
fully

  nlook at these rocks
cried the seated man with a
sudden force of gesture
look at that sea that has
shone and quivered there for-
ever see the white spume
rush into darkness under
that great cliff and this
blue vault with the blinding
sun pouring from the dome
of it it is your world you
accept it you rejoice in it
it warms and supports and
delights you and for me-
tie turned his head and showed a ghastly face blood-
sot pallid eyes and bloodless lips he spoke almost
in a whisper it is the garment of my misery the
whole world  is the garment of my misery
isbister looked at all the wild beauty of the sunlit
cliffs about them and back to that face of despair for
a moment he was silent

he started nd made a gesture of impatient rejec-
tion you get a nights sleep he said and you
wont see much misery out here take my word for it
he was quite sure now that this was a providential

     t f one were to ask us for the names of the
     five greatest scientific stories that have
     been written so far one of the five would
     unquestionably be when the
     sleeper wakes

        few stories of the scientifiction type are
     as absorbing or grip your imagination
     with such intensity as does this story the
     theme of a man waking up after a 
     year sleep may not be so novel in itself
     but under wells treatment it certainly be-
     comes the outstanding story of its class of
     all times it is crammed f ull with adven-
     ture and surprises and there is hardly a
     page that does not retain your full inter-
     est while this story was written years
     ago before the advent of the aeroplane it
     still remains true in practically every way
     mr wells not only anticipated the aero-
     plane and to a good extent broadcasting
     as it has come to pass but he anticipated
     many other inventions some of which we
     are still ignorant of though they are cer-
     tain to be realized if you want to know

when the sleeper wakes



encounter only half an hour ago he had been feeling
horribly bored here was employment the bare thought
of which was righteous self-applause he took posses-
sion forthwith it seemed to him that the first need
of this exhausted being was companionship he flung
himself down on the steeply sloping turf beside the mo-
tionless seated figure and deployed forthwith into a
skirmishing line of gossip

  his hearer seemed to have lapsed into apathy he
stared dismally seaward and spoke only in answer to
isbisters direct questions-and not to all of those but
he made no sign of objection to this benevolent intrusion
upon his despair

  in a helpless way he seemed even grateful and when
presently isbister feeling that his unsupported talk was
losing vigour suggested that they should reascend the
steep and return towards boscastle alleging the view
into blackapit he submitted quietly halfway up he be-
gan talking to himself and abruptly turned a ghastly
face on his helper what can be happening he asked
with a gaunt illustrative hand what can be happen-
ing spin spin spin spin it goes round and round
round and round for evermore

  he stood with his hand circling

  its all right old chap said isbister with the air
of an old friend dont worry yourself trust to me

the man dropped his hand and turned again they
went over the brow in single file and to the head-
land beyond penally with the sleepless man gesticulating
ever and again and speaking fragmentary things con-
cerning his whirling brain at the headland they stood
for a space by the seat that looks into the dark mys-
teries of blackapit and then he sat down isbister
had resumed his talk whenever the path had widened
sufficiently for them to walk abreast he was enlarg-
ing upon the complex difficulty of making boscastle har-
bour in bad weather when suddenly and quite irrel-
evantly his companion interrupted him again

  my head is not like what it was he said gesticu-
lating for want of expressive phrases its not like
what it was there is a sort of oppression a weight
no-not drowsiness would god it were it is like a
shadow a deep shadow falling suddenly and swiftly
across something busy spin spin into the darkness
the tumult of thought the confusion the eddy and eddy
i cant express it i can hardly keep my mind on it-
steadily enough to tell you

  he stopped feebly

  dont trouble old chap said isbister i think
i can understand at any rate it doesnt matter very
much just at present about telling me you know

  the sleepless man thrust his knuckles into his eyes
and rubbed them isbister talked for awhile while
this rubbing continued and then he had a fresh idea
come down to my room he said and try a pipe i
can show you some sketches of this blackapit if youd
care

  the other rose obediently and followed him down the
steep

  several times isbister heard him stumble as they came
down and his movements were slow and hesitating
come in with me said isbister and try some cigar-
ettes and the blessed gift of alcohol if you take
alcohol

  the stranger hesitated at the garden gate he seemed
no longer clearly aware of his actions i dont drink
he said slowly coming up the garden path and after a
moments interval repeated absently no-i dont drink
it goes round spin it goes-spin-

  he stumbled at the doorstep and entered the room
with the bearing of one who sees nothing

  then he sat down abruptly and heavily in the easy

chair seemed almost to fall into it he leant forward
with his brows on his hands and became motionless

  presently he made a faint sound in his throat isbister
moved about the room with the nervousness of an in-
experienced host making little remarks that scarcely re-
quired answering he crossed the room to his portfolio
placed it on the table and noticed the mantel clock

  i dont know if youd care to have supper with me
he said with an unlighted cigarette in his hand-his
mind troubled with a design of the furtive administra-
tion of chloral only cold mutton you know but pass-
ing sweet welsh and a tart i believe he repeated
this after momentary silence

  the seated man made no answer isbister stopped
match in hand regarding him

  the stillness lengthened the match went out the
cigarette was put down unlit the man was certainly
very still isbister took up the portfolio opened it put
it down hesitated seemed about to speak perhaps
he whispered doubtfully presently he glanced at the
door and back to the figure then he stole on tiptoe
out of the room glancing at his companion after each
elaborate pace

  he closed the door noiselessly the house door was
standing open and he went out beyond the porch and
stood where the monkshood rose at the corner of the
garden bed from this point he could see the stranger
through the open window still and dim sitting head
on hand he had not moved

  a number of children going along the road stopped
and regarded the artist curiously a boatman ex-
changed civilities with him he felt that possibly his
circumspect attitude and position seemed peculiar and
unaccountable smoking perhaps might seem more
natural he drew pipe and pouch from his pocket filled
the pipe slowly

  i wonder  he said with a scarcely per-
ceptible loss of complacency at any rate one must
give him a chance he struck a match in the virile
way and proceeded to light his pipe

  presently he heard his landlady behind him coming
with his lamp lit from the kitchen he turned ges-
ticulating with his pipe and stopped her at the door
of his sitting-room he had some difficulty in explain-
ing the situation in whispers for she did not know he
had a visitor she retreated again with the lamp still a
little mystified to judge from her manner and he re-
sumed his hovering at the comer of the porch flushed
and less at his ease

  long after he had smoked out his pipe and when
the bats were abroad his curiosity dominated his com-
plex hesitations and he stole back into his darkling
sitting-room he paused in the doorway the stranger
was still in the same attitude dark against the window
save for the singing of some sailors aboard one of the
little slate-carrying ships in the harbour the evening
was very still outside the spikes of monkshood and
delphinium stood erect and motionless against the
shadow of the hillside something flashed into isbisters
mind he started and leaning over the table listened
an unpleasant suspicion grew stronger became convic-
tion astonishment seized him and became-dread

  no sound of breathing came from the seated figure

  -ie crept slowly and noiselessly round the table paus-
ing twice to listen at last he could lay his hand on
the back of the armchair he bent down until the
two heads were ear to ear

  then he bent still lower to look up at his visitors
face he started violently and uttered an exclamation
the eyes were void spaces of white

  he looked again and saw that they were open and
with pupils rolled under the lids he was suddenly
afraid overcome by the strangeness of the mans con-

it is either death or a fit

dition he took him by the shoulder and shook him
are you asleep he said with his voice jumping into
alto and again are you asleep

  a conviction took possession of his mind that this
man was dead he suddenly became active and noisy
strode across the room blundering against the table as
he did so and rang the bell

  please bring a light at once he said in the passage
there is something wrong with my friend

  then he returned to the motionless seated figure
grasped the shoulder shook it and shouted the room
was flooded with yellow glare as his astonished landlady
entered with the light his face was white as he turned
blinking towards her i must fetch a doctor at once
he said it is either death or a fit is there a doctor
in the village where is a doctor to be found

                chapter ii
                the trance

the state of cataleptic rigour into which this man
had fallen lasted for an unprecedented length of
time and then he passed slowly to the flaccid state
to a lax attitude suggestive of profound repose then
it was his eyes could be closed

  he was removed from the hotel to the boscastle
surgery and from the surgery after some weeks to
london but he still resisted every attempt at reani-
mation after a time for reasons that will appear later
these attempts were discontinued for a great space he
lay in that strange condition inert and still-neither
dead nor living but as it were suspended hanging mid-
way between nothingness and existence his was a dark-
ness unbroken by a ray of thought or sensation a dream-
less inanition a vast space of peace the tumult of
his mind had swelled and risen to an abrupt climax of

silence where was the man where is any man when
insensibility takes hold of him

  it seems only yesterday said isbister i remember
it all as though it happened yesterday-clearer perhaps
than if it had happened yesterday

  it was the isbister of the last chapter but he was
no longer a young man the hair that had been brown
and a trifle in excess of the fashionable length was iron
grey and clipped close and the face that had been pink
and white was buff and ruddy he had a pointed beard
shot with grey he talked to an elderly man who wore
a summer suit of drill the summer of that year was
unusually hot this was warming a london solicitor
and next of kin to graham the man who had fallen into
the trance and the two men stood side by side in a
room in a house in london regarding his recumbent
figure

  it was a yellow figure lying lax upon a water-bed
and clad in a flowing shirt a figure with a shrunken
face and a stubby beard lean limbs and lank nails and
about it was a case of thin glass this glass seemed to
mark off the sleeper from the reality of life about him
he was a thing apart a strange isolated abnormality
the two men stood close to the glass peering in

  the thing gave me a shock said isbister i feel
a queer sort of surprise even now when i think of his
white eyes they were white you know rolled up com-
ing here again brings it all back to me

  have you never seen him since that time asked
warming

  often wanted to come said isbister but business
nowadays is too serious a thing for much holiday keep-
ing ive been in america most of the time

  if i remember rightly said warming you were
an artist

  was and then i became a married man i saw
it was all up with black and white very soon-at least
for a mediocre man i jumped on to process those pos-
ters on the cliffs at dover are by my people

  good posters admitted the solicitor though i was
sorry to see them there

  last as long as the cliffs if necessary exclaimed
isbister with satisfaction the world changes when
he fell asleep twenty years ago i was down at boscastle
with a box of water-colors and a noble old-fashioned
ambition i didnt expect that some day my pigments
would glorify the whole blessed coast of england from
lands end round again to the lizard luck comes to
a man very often when hes not looking

  warming seemed to doubt the quality of the luck i
just missed seeing you if i recollect aright

  you came back by the trap that took me to camel-
ford railway station it was close on the jubilee vic-
torias jubilee because i remember the seats and flags in
westminster and the row with the cabman at chelsea

  the diamond jubilee it was said warming the
second one

  ah yes at the proper jubilee-the fifty year
affair-i was down at wookey-a boy i missed all
that    what a fuss we had with him my land-
lady wouldnt take him in wouldnt let him stay-he
looked so queer when he was rigid we had to carry
him in a chair up to the hotel and the boscastle doc-
tor-it wasnt the present chap but the g p before
him-was at him until nearly two with me and the
landlord holding lights and so forth

  it was a cataleptic rigour at first wasnt it
stiff-wherever you bent him he stuck you
might have stood him on his head and hed have stopped
i never saw such stiffness of course this-he indi-
cated the prostrate figure by a movement of his head-
is quite different and of course the little doctor-
what was his name

  smithers
when the sleeper wakes



  smithers it was-was quite wrong in trying to fetch
him round too soon according to all accounts the things
he did even now it makes me feel all-ugh mustard
snuff pricking and one of those beastly little things
not dynamos-

  induction coils

  yes you could see his muscles throb and jump
and he twisted about there was just two flaring yel-
low candles and all the shadows were shivering and
the little doctor nervous and putting on side and him-
stark and squirming in the most unnatural ways well
it made me dream

  pause

  its a strange state said warming

  its a sort of complete absence said isbister heres
the body empty not dead a bit and yet not alive its
like a seat vacant and marked engaged no feeling
no digestion no beating of the heart-not a flutter
that doesnt make me feel as if there was a man present
in a sense its more dead than death for these doctors
tell me that even the hair has stopped growing now
with the proper dead the hair will go on growing-

  i know said warming with a flash of pain in his
expression

they peered through the glass again graham was
indeed in a strange state in the flaccid phase of a
trance but a trance unprecedented in medical history
trances had lasted for as much as a year before-but at
the end of that time it had ever been a waking or a
death sometimes first one and then the other isbister
noted the marks the physicians had made in injecting
nourishment for that device had been resorted to to
postpone collapse he pointed them out to warming who
had been trying not to see them

  and while he has been lying here said isbister
with the zest of a life freely spent i have changed my
plans in life married raised a family my eldest lad-
i hadnt begun to think of sons then-is an american
citizen and looking forward to leaving harvard theres
a touch of grey in my hair and this man not a day
older nor wiser practically than i was in my downy
days its curious to think of

  warming turned and i have grown old too i
played cricket with him when i was still only a lad and
hq looks a young man still yellow perhaps but
that is a young man nevertheless

  and theres been the war said isbister

  from beginning to end

  and these martians

  ive understood said isbister after a pause that
he had some moderate property of his own

  that is so said warming he coughed primly as
it happens-i have charge of it

  ah isbister thought hesitated and spoke no
doubt-his keep here is not expensive-no doubt it will
have improved-accumulated 

  it has he will wake up very much better off-if he
wakes-than when he slept

  as a business man said isbister that thought has
naturally been in my mind i have indeed sometimes
thought that speaking commercially of course this
sleep may be a very good thing for him that he knows
what he is about so to speak in being insensible so
long if he had lived straight on-

  i doubt if he would have premeditated as much said
warming he was not a far-sighted man in fact-
yes

  we differed on that point i stood to him ome-
what in the relation of a guardian you have probcliy
seen enough of affairs to recognize that occasionally 
certain friction-

there is a doubt whether he will ever wake this sleep
exhausts slowly but it exhausts apparently he is slid-

ing slowly very slowly and tediously down a long
slope if you can understand me

  it will be a pity to lose his surprise theres been
a lot of change these twenty years its rip van winkle
come real

  its bellamy said warming there has been a lot
of change certainly and among other changes i have
changed i am an old man

  isbister hesitated and then feigned a belated sur-
prise i shouldnt have thought it

  i was forty-three when his bankers-you remember
you wired to his bankers-sent on to me

  i got their address from the cheque book in his
pocket said isbister

  well the addition is not difficult said warming
there was another pause and then isbister gave way
to an unavoidable curiosity he may go on for years
yet he said and had a moment of hesitation we
have to consider that his affairs you know may fall
some day into the hands of-someone else you know
that if you will beileve me mr isbister is one of
the problems most constantly before my mind we hap-
pen to be-as a matter of fact there are no very trust-
worthy connections of ours it is a grotesque and un-
precedented position

  it is said isbister as a matter of fact its a
case for a public trustee if only we had such a func-
tionary

  it seems to me its a case for some public body some
practically undying guardian if he really is going on
living-as the doctors some of them think as a mat-
ter of fact i have gone to one or two public men about
it but so far nothing has been done

  it wouldnt be a bad idea to hand him over to some
public booy-the british museum trustees or the royal
college of physicians sounds a bit odd of course but
the whole situation is odd

  the difficulty is to induce them to take him

  red tape i suppose

  partly

  pause its a curious business certainly said
isbister and compound interest has a way of mount-
ing up

  it has said warming and now the gold supplies
are running short there is a tendency towards   
appreciation

  ive felt that said isbister with a grimace but
it makes it better for him

  if he wakes

  if he wakes echoed isbister do you notice the
pinched-in look of his-nose and the way in which his
eyelids sink

  warming looked and thought for a space i doubt
if he will wake he said at last

  i never properly understood said isbister what
it was brought this on he told me something about
overstudy ive often been curious

  he was a man of considerable gifts but spasmodic
emotional he had grave domestic troubles divorced
his wife in fact and it was as a relief from that i
think that he took up politics of the rabid sort he
was a fanatical radical-a socialist-or typical liberal
as they used to call themselves of the advanced school
energetic-flighty-undisciplined overwork upon a
controversy did this for him i remember the pamphlet
he wrote-a curious production wild whirling stuff
there were one or two prophecies some of them are

                                     already exploded some of them are established facts
 but for the most part to read such a thesis is to realize
 how full the world is of unanticipated things he will
 have much to learn much to unlearn when he wakes
 but even if that was the case if ever a waking comes

                                         id give anything to be there said isbister just
                                       to hear what he would say to it all


amazing stories quarterly

  so would i said warming aye so would i
with an old mans sudden turn to self pity but i shall
never see him wake

  he stood looking thoughtfully at the waxen figure
he will never wake he said at last he sighed he
will never wake again

           chapter iii
           the awakening

ut wanning was wrong in that an awakening
came

  what a wonderfully complex thing this simple
seeming unity-the self who can trace its reintegra-
tion as morning after morning we awaken the flux and
confluence of its countless factors interweaving rebuild-
ing the dim first stirrings of the soul the growth and
synthesis of the unconscious to the sub-conscious the
sub-conscious to dawning consciousness until at last we
recognize ourselves again and as it happens to most of
us after the nights sleep so it was with graham at the
end of his vast slumber a dim cloud of sensation tak-
ing shape a cloudy dreariness and he found himself
vaguely somewhere recumbent faint but alive

  the pilgrimage towards a personal being seemed to
traverse vast gulfs to occupy epochs gigantic dreams
that were terrible realities at the time left vague per-
plexing memories strange creatures strange scenery as
if from another planet there was a distinct impres-
sion too of a momentous conversation of a name-he
could not tell what name-that was subsequently to recur
of some queer long-forgotten sensation of vein and
muscle of a feeling of vast hopeless effort the effort of
a man near drowning in darkness then came a pano-
rama of dazzling unstable confluent scenes

  graham became aware his eyes were open and re-
garding some unfamiliar thing

  it was something white the edge of something a
frame of wood he moved his head slightly following
the contour of this shape it went up beyond the top
of his eyes he tried to think where he might be did
it matter seeing he was so wretched the color of
his thoughts was a dark depression he felt the feature-
less misery of one who wakes towards the hour of dawn
he had an uncertain sense of whispers and footsteps
hastily receding

  the movement of his head involved a perception of
extreme physical weakness he supposed he was in bed
in the hotel at the place in the valley-but he could not
recall that white edge he must have slept he remem-
bered now that he had wanted to sleep he recalled the
cliff and waterfall again and then recollected something
about talking to a passer-by   

  how long had he slept what was that sound of
pattering feet and that rise and fall like the mur-
mur of breakers on pebbles he put out a languid
hand to reach his watch from the chair whereon it was
his habit to place it and touched some smooth hard
surface like glass this was so unexpected that it
startled him extremely quite suddenly he rolled over
stared for a moment and struggled into a sitting posi-
tion the effort was unexpectedly difficult and it left
him giddy and weak-and amazed

  he rubbed his eyes the riddle of his surroundings
was confusing but his mind was quite clear-evidently
his sleep had benefitted him he was not in a bed at
all as he understood the word but lying naked on a very
soft and yielding mattress in a trough of dark glass the
mattress was partly transparent a fact he observed with
a strange sense of insecurity and below it was a mirror
reflecting him greyly about his arm-and he saw with
a shock that his skin was strangely dry and yellow-was
bound a curious apparatus of rubber bound so cunningly
that it seemed to pass into his skin above and below and

this strange bed was placed in a case of greenish colored
glass as it seemed to him a bar in the white frame-
work of which had first arrested his attention in the
corner of the case was a stand of glittering and deli-
cately made apparatus for the most part quite strange
appliances though a maximum and minimum thermom-
eter was recognizable

  the slightly greenish tint of the glass-like substance
which surrounded him on every hand obscured what lay
behind but he perceived it was a vast apartment of
splendid appearance and with a very large and simple
white archway facing him close to the walls of the
cage were articles of furniture a table covered with a
silvery cloth silvery like the side of a fish a couple
of graceful chairs and on the table a number of dishes
with substances piled on them a bottle and two glasses
he realized that he was intensely hungry

  he could see no human being and after a period of
hesitation scrambled off the translucent mattress and
tried to stand on the clean white floor of his little apart-
ment he had miscalculated his strength however and
staggered and put his hand against the glass-like pane
before him to steady himself for a moment it resisted
his hand bending outward like a distended bladder then
it broke with a slight report and vanished-a pricked
bubble he reeled out into the general space of the hall
greatly astonished he caught at the table to save him-
self knocking one of the glasses to the floor-it rang
but did not break-and sat down in one of the arm-
chairs

  when he had a little recovered he filled the remaining
glass from the bottle and drank-a colorless liquid it
was but not water with a pleasing faint aroma and taste
and a quality of immediate support and stimulus he
put down the vessel and looked about him

  the apartment lost none of its size and magnificence
now that the greenish transparency that had intervened
was removed the archway he saw led to a flight of
steps going downward without the intermediation of a
door to a spacious transverse passage this passage
ran between polished pillars of some white-veined sub-
stance of deep ultramarine and along it came the sound
of human movements and voices and a deep undeviating
droning note he sat now fully awake listening alertly
forgetting the viands in his attention

  then with a shock he remembered that he was naked
and casting about him for covering saw a long black
robe thrown on one of the chairs beside him this he
wrapped about him and sat down again trembling

  his mind was still a surging perplexity clearly he
had slept and had been removed in his sleep but where
and who were those people the distant crowd beyond
the deep blue pillars boscastle he poured out and par-
tially drank another glass of the colorless fluid

  what was this place-this place that to his senses
seemed subtly quivering like a thing alive he looked
about him at the clean and beautiful form of the apart-
ment unstained by ornament and saw that the roof was
broken in one place by a circular shaft full of light and
as he looked a steady sweeping shadow blotted it out
and passed and came again and passed beat beat
that sweeping shadow had a note of its own in the sub-
dued tumult that filled the air

  he would have called out but only a little sound came
into his throat then he stood up and with the uncer-
tain steps of a drunkard made his way towards the arch-
way he staggered down the steps tripped on the corner
of the black cloak he had wrapped about himself and
saved himself by catching at one of the blue pillars

  the passage ran down a cool vista of blue and purple
and ended remotely in a railed space like a balcony
brightly lit and projecting into a space of haze a space
like the interior of some gigantic building beyond and
remote were vast and vague architectural forms the
when the sleeper wakes



tumult of voices rose now loud and clear and on the
balcony and with their backs to him gesticulating and
apparently in animated conversation were three figures
richly dressed in loose and easy garments of bright soft
colorings the noise of a great multitude of people
poured up over the balcony and once it seemed the top
of a banner passed and once some brightly colored
object a pale blue cap or garment thrown up into the
air perhaps flashed athwart the space and fell the
shouts sounded like english there was a reiteration of
wake he heard some indistinct shrill cry and
abruptly these three men began laughing

  ha ha ha laughed one-a red-haired man in a
short purple robe when the sleeper wakes-when

  he turned his eyes full of merriment along the pas-
sage his face changed the whole man changed became
rigid the other two turned swiftly at his exclamation
and stood motionless their faces assumed an expres-
sion of consternation an expression that deepened into
awe

  suddenly grahams knees bent beneath him his arm
against the pillar collapsed limply he staggered forward
and fell upon his face

chapter iv
the sound of a tumult

grahams last impression before he fainted was
of a clamorous ringing of bells he learnt after-
wards that he was insensible hanging between life
and death for the better part of an hour when he re-
covered his senses he was back on his translucent couch
and there was a stirring warmth at heart and throat
the dark apparatus he perceived had been removed from
his arm which was bandaged the white framework
was still about him but the greenish transparent sub-
stance that had filled it was altogetheivone a man in
a deep violet robe one of those who had been on the
balcony was looking keenly into his face

  remote but insistent was a clamor of tells and con-
fused sounds that suggested to his mind the picture of a
great number of people shouting together something
seemed to fall across this tumult a door suddeily closed

  graham moved his head what does this all mean
he said slowly where am i 

  he saw the red-haired man who had been first to dis-
cover him a voice seemed to be asking what he had
said and was abruptly stilled

  the man in violet answered in a soft voice speaking
english with a slightly foreign accent or so at least it
seemed to the sleepers ears you are quite safe you
were brought hither from where you fell asleep it is
quite safe you have been here some time-sleeping
in a trance

  he said something further that graham could not hear
and a little phial was handed across to him graham
felt a cooling spray a fragrant mist played over his fore-
head for a moment and his sense of refreshment in-
creased he closed his eyes in satisfaction

  better asked the man in violet as grahams eyes
reopened he was a pleasant-faced man of thirty per-
haps with a pointed flaxen beard and a clasp of gold at
the neck of his violet robe

  yes said graham

  you have been asleep some time in a cataleptic
trance you have heard catalepsy it may seem
strange to you at first but i can assure you everything is
well

  graham did not answer but these words served their
reassuring purpose his eyes went from face to face of
the three people about him they were regarding him
strangely he knew he ought to be somewhere in corn-
wall but he could not square these things with that
impression

  a matter that had been in his mind during his last
waking moments at boscastle recurred a thing resolved
upon and somehow neglected he cleared his throat

  have you wired my cousin he asked e warm-
ing  chancery lane

  they were all assiduous to hear but he had to repeat
it what an odd blurr in his accent whispered the
red-haired man wire sir said the young man with
the flaxen beard evidently puzzled

  he means send an electric telegram volunteered the
third a pleasant-faced youth of nineteen or twenty the
flaxen-bearded man gave a cry of comprehension how
stupid of me you may be sure everything shall be
done sir he said to graham i am afraid it would be
difficult to-wire to your cousin he is not in london
now but dont trouble about arrangements yet you
have been asleep a very long time and the important
thing is to get over that sir graham concluded the
word was sir but this man pronounced it sire

  oh said graham and became quiet

  it was all very puzzling but apparently these people
in unfamiliar dress knew what they were about yet
they were odd and the room was odd it seemed he was
in some newly established place he had a sudden flash
of suspicion surely this wasnt some hall of public exhi-
bition if it was he would give warming a piece of his
mind but it scarcely had that character and in a
place of public exhibition he would not have discovered
himself naked

  then suddenly quite abruptly he realised what had
happened there was no perceptible interval of suspi-
cion no dawn to his knowledge abruptly he knew that
his trance had lasted for a vast interval as if by some
processes of thought reading he interpreted the awe in
the faces that peered into his he looked at them
strangely full of intense emotion it seemed they read
his eyes he framed his lips to speak and could not
a queer impulse to hide his knowledge came into his
mind almost at the moment of his discovery he
looked at his bare feet regarding them silently his
impulse to speak passed he was trembling exceedingly

  they gave him some pink fluid with a greenish fluor-
esence and a meaty taste and the assurance of returning
strength grew

  that-that makes me feel better he said hoarsely
and there were murmurs of respectful approval he
knew now quite clearly he made to speak again and
again he could not

  he pressed his throat and tried a third time how
long  he asked in a level voice how long have i been
asleep

  some considerable time said the flaxen-bearded man
glancing quickly at the others

  how long

  a very long time

  yes-yes said graham suddenly testy but i want

-	is it-it is-some years many years there was
something-i forget what i feel-confused but you-
he sobbed you need not fence with me how long-

  he stopped breathing irregularly he squeezed his
eyes with his knuckles and sat waiting for an answer

  they spoke in undertones

  five or six he asked faintly more

  very much more than that

  more

  more

  he looked at them and it seemed as though imps were
twitching the muscles of his face he looked his question

  many years said the man with the red beard

  graham struggled into a sitting position he wiped
a rheumy tear from his face with a lean hand many
years he repeated he shut his eyes tight opened
them and sat looking about him from one unfamiliar
thing to another


amazing stories quarterly

 how many years he asked

 you must be prepared to be surprised

 well

 more than a gross of years

 he was irritated at the strange word more than

 a what

 two of them spoke together some quick remarks that
 were made about decimal he did not catch

 how long did you say asked graham how long
 dont look like that tell me

 among the remarks in an undertone his ear caught
 six words more than a couple of centuries

 what he cried turning on the youth who he thought
 had spoken who says- what was that a couple
 of centuries

 yes said the man with the red beard two hundred
 years

 graham repeated the words he had been prepared to
 hear of a vast repose and yet these concrete centuries
 defeated him

 two hundred years he said again with the figure
 of a great gulf opening very slowly in his mind and
 then oh but-

 they said nothing

 you-did you say-

 two hundred years two centuries of years said
 the man with the red beard

 there was a pause graham looked at their faces and
 saw that what he had heard was indeed true

 but it cant be he said querulously i am dream-
 ing trances trances dont last that is not right-
 this is a joke you have played upon me tell me-some
 days ago perhaps i was walking along the coast of
 cornwall-

 his voice failed him

 the man with the flaxen beard hesitated im not
 very strong in history sir he said weakly and glanced
 at the others

 that was it sir said the youngster boscastle in
 the old duchy of cornwall-its in the southwest country
 beyond the dairy meadows there is a house there still
 i have been there

 boscastle graham turned his eyes to the youngster
 that was it-boscastle little boscastle i fell asleep-
 somewhere there i dont exactly remember i dont
 exactly remember

 he pressed his brows and whispered more than two
 hundred years

 he began to speak quickly with a twitching face but
 his heart was cold within him but if it is two hundred
 years every soul i know every human being that ever
 i saw or spoke to before i went to sleep must be dead
 they did not answer him

 the queen and the royal family her ministers
 church and state high and low rich and poor one
 with another-

 is there england still

 thats a comfort is there london

 this is london eh and you are my assistant-
 custodian assistant-custodian and these- eh
 assistant-custodians too

 he sat with a gaunt stare on his face but why am
 i here no dont talk be quiet let me-

 he sat silent rubbed his eyes and uncovering them
 found another little glass of pinkish fluid held
 towards him he took the dose it was almost immedi-
 ately sustaining directly he had taken it he began to
 weep naturally and refreshingly

 presently he looked at their faces suddenly laughed
 through his tears a little foolishly but-two-hun-
 dred-years he said he grimaced hysterically and
 covered up his face again

 after a space he grew calm he sat up his hands

 hanging over his knees in almost precisely the same
 attitude in which isbister had found him on the cliff at
 pentargen his attention was attracted by a thick domi-
 neering voice the footsteps of an advancing personage
 what are you doing why was i not warned surely
 you could tell someone will suffer for this the man
 must be kept quiet are the doorways closed all the
 doorways he must be kept perfectly quiet he must
 not be told has he been told anything

  the man with the fair beard made some inaudible
remark and graham looking over his shoulder saw
approaching a very short fat and thickset beardless man
with aquiline nose and heavy neck and chin very thick
black and slightly sloping eyebrows that almost met
over his nose and overhung deep grey eyes gave his
face an oddly formidable expression he scowled mo-
mentarily at graham and then his regard returned to
the man with the flaxen beard these others he said
in a voice of extreme irritation you had better go
go said the red-bearded man

  certainly-go now but see the doorways are closed
as you go

  the two men addressed turned obediently after one
reluctant glance at graham and instead of going through
the archway as he expected walked straight to the dead
wall of the apartment opposite the archway and then
came a strange thing a long strip of this apparently
solid wall rolled up with a snap hung over the two re-
treating men and fell again and immediately graham
was alone with the newcomer and the purple-robed man
with the flaxen beard

  for a space the thickset man took not the slightest
notice of graham but proceeded to interrogate the other
-obviously his subordinate-upon the treatment of their
charge he spoke clearly but in phrases only partially
intelligible to graham the awakening seemed not only
a matter of surprise but of consternation and annoyance
to him he was evidently profoundly excited

  you must not confuse his mind by telling him things
he repeated again and again you must not confuse
his mind

  his questions answered he turned quickly and eyed
the awakened sleeper with an ambiguous expression
feel queer he asked

  very

  the world what you see of it seems strange to you
  i suppose i have to live in it strange as it seems

  i suppose so now

in the first place hadnt i better have some clothes
they- said the thickset man and stopped and the
flaxen-bearded man met his eye and went away you
will very speedily have clothes said the thickset man

  is it true indeed that i have been asleep two hundred
- asked graham

  they have told you that have they two hundred
and three as a matter of fact

  graham accepted the indisputable now with raised eye-
brows and depressed mouth he sat silent for a moment
and then asked a question is there a mill or dynamo
near here he did not wait for an answer things
have changed tremendously i suppose he said

  what is that shouting he asked abruptly
nothing said the thickset man impatiently its
people youll understand better later-perhaps as
you say things have changed he spoke shortly his
brows were knit and he glanced about him like a man
trying to decide in an emergency we must get you
clothes and so forth at any rate better wait here until
some can come no one will come near you you want
shaving

  graham rubbed his chin

  the man with the flaxen beard came back towards
them turned suddenly listened for a moment lifted his
eyebrows at the older man and hurried off through the
when the sleeper wakes



archway towards the balcony the tumult of shouting
grew louder and the thickset man turned and listened
also he cursed suddenly under his breath and turned
his eyes upon graham with an unfriendly expression
it was a surge of many voices rising and falling shout-
ing and screaming and once came a sound like blows
and sharp cries and then a snapping like the crackling of
dry sticks graham strained his ears to draw some single
thread of sound from the woven tumult

  then he perceived repeated again and again a certain
formula for a time he doubted his ears but surely
these were the words show us the sleeper show
us the sleeper

  the thickset man rushed suddenly to the archway

  wild he cried how do they know do they know
or is it guessing

  there was perhaps an answer

  i cant come said the thickset man i have him to
see to but shout from the balcony

  there was an inaudible reply

  say he is not awake anything i leave it to you

  he came hurrying back to graham you must have
clothes at once he said you cannot stop here-and it
will be impossible to-

  he rushed away graham shouting unanswered ques-
tions after him in a moment he was back

  i cant tell you what is happening it is too complex
to explain in a moment you shall have your clothes
made yes-in a moment and then i can take you
away from here you will find out our troubles soon
enough

  but those voices they were shouting-

  something about the sleeper-thats you they have
some twisted idea i dont know what it is i know
nothing

  a shrill bell jetted acutely across the indistinct min-
gling of remote noises and this brusque person sprang
to a little group of appliances in the corner of the room
lie listened for a moment regarding a ball of crystal
nodded and said a few indistinct words then he walked
to the wall through which the two men had vanished it
rolled up again like a curtain and he stood waiting

  graham lifted his arm and was astonished to find what
strength the restoratives had given him he thrust one
leg over the side of the couch and then the other his
head no longer swam he could scarcely credit his rapid
recovery he sat feeling his limbs

  the man with the flaxen beard re-entered from the
archway and as he did so the cage of a lift came sliding
down in front of the thickset man and a lean grey-
bearded man carrying a roll and wearing a tightly-
fitting costume of dark green appeared therein

  this is the tailor said the thickset man with an
introductory gesture it will never do for you to wear
that black i cannot understand how it got here but
i shall i shall you will be as rapid as possible he
said to the tailor

  the man in green bowed and advancing seated him-
self by graham on the bed his manner was calm but
his eyes were full of curiosity you will find the fash-
ions altered sire he said he glanced from under his
brows at the thickset man

he opened the roller with a quick movement and a
confusion of brilliant fabrics poured out over his
knees you lived sire in a period essentially cylin-
drical-the victorian with a tendency to the hemi-
sphere in hats circular curves always now- he
flicked out a little appliance the size and appearance of
a keyless watch whirled the knob and behold-a little
figure in white appeared kinetoscope fashion on the dial
walking and turning the tailor caught up a pattern of
bluish white satin that is my conception of your im-
mediate treatment he said

  the thickset man came and stood by the shoulder of
graham

  we have very little time he said

  trust me said the tailor my machine follows
what do you think of this

  what is that asked the man from the nineteenth
century

  in your days they showed you a fashion-plate said
the tailor but this is our modern development see
here the little figure repeated its revolutions but in
a different costume or this and with a click another
small figure in a more voluminous type of robe marched
on to the dial the tailor was very quick in his move-
ments and glanced twice towards the lift as he did these
things

  it rumbled again and a crop-haired anaemic lad with
features of the chinese type clad in coarse pale blue
canvas appeared together with a complicated machine
which he pushed noiselessly on little castors into the
room incontinently the little kinetoscope was dropped
graham was invited to stand in front of the machine and
the tailor muttered some instructions to the crop-haired
lad who answered in guttural tones and with words
graham did not recognize the boy then went to conduct
an incomprehensible monologue in the corner and the
tailor pulled out a number of slotted arms terminat-
ing in little discs pulling them out until the discs were
flat against the body of graham one at each shoulder
blade one at the elbows one at the neck and so forth
so that at last there were perhaps two score of them
upon his body and limbs at the same time some other
person entered the room by the lift behind graham the
tailor set moving a mechanism that initiated a faint-
sounding rhythmic movement of parts in the machine
and in another moment he was knocking up the levers
and graham was released the tailor replaced his cloak
of black and the man with the flaxen beard proffered him
a little glass of some refreshing fluid graham saw over
the rim of the glass a pale-faced young man regarding
him with a singular fixity

  the thickset man had been pacing the room fretfully
and now turned and went through the archway towards
the balcony from which the noise of a distant crowd still
came in gusts and cadences the crop-headed lad handed
the tailor a roll of the bluish satin and the two began
fixing this in the mechanism in a manner reminiscent of
a roll of paper in a nineteenth century printing machine
then they ran the entire thing on its easy noiseless bear-
ings across the room to a remote corner where a twisted
cable looped rather gracefully from the wall they made
some connection and the machine became energetic and
swift

  what is that doing asked graham pointing with
the empty glass to the busy figures and trying to ignore
the scrutiny of the newcomer is that-some sort of
force-laid on

  yes said the man with the flaxen beard

  who is that he indicated the archway behind him

  the man in purple stroked his little beard hesitated
and answered in an undertone he is howard your chief
guardian you see sire-its a little difficult to explain
the council appoints a guardian and assistants this
hall has under certain restrictions been public in order
that people might satisfy themselves we have
barred the doorways for the first time but i think-if
you dont mind i will leave him to explain

  odd said graham guardian council then
turning his back on the newcomer he asked in an under-
tone why is this man glaring at me is he a mes-
merist

  mesmerist he is a capillotomist

  capillotomist

  yes-one of the chief his yearly fee is sixdoz lions

  it sounded sheer nonsense graham snatched at the


amazing stories quarterly

last phrase with an unsteady mind sixdoz lions he

said

  didnt you have lions i suppose not you had the
old pounds they are our monetary units

  but what was that you said-sixdoz

  yes six dozen sire of course things even these
little things have altered you lived in the days of the
decimal system the arab system-tens and little hun-
dreds and thousands we have eleven numerals now
we have single figures for both ten and eleven two fig-
ures for a dozen and a dozen dozen makes a gross a great
hundred you know a dozen gross a dozand and a dozand
dozand a myriad very simple

  i suppose so said graham but about this cap-
what was it

  the man with the flaxen beard glanced over his
shoulder

  here are your clothes he said graham turned
round sharply and saw the tailor standing at his elbow
smiling and holding some palpably new garments over
his arm the crop-headed boy by means of one finger
was impelling the complicated machine towards the lift
by which he had arrived graham stared at the com-
pleted suit you dont mean to say-

  just made said the tailor he dropped the gar-
ments at the feet of graham walked to the bed on which
graham had so recently been lying flung out the trans-
lucent mattress and turned up the looking-glass as he
did so a furious bell summoned the thickset man to the
corner the man with the flaxen beard rushed across to
him and then hurried out by the archway

  the tailor was assisting graham into a dark purple
combination garment stockings vest and pants in one
as the thickset man came back from the corner to meet
the man with the flaxen beard returning from the bal-
cony they began speaking quickly in an undertone
their bearing had an unmistakable quality of anxiety
over the purple under-garment came a complex but grace-
ful garment of bluish white and graham was clothed
in the fashion once more and saw himself sallow-faced
unshaven and shaggy still but at least naked no longer
and in some indefinable unprecedented way graceful

  i must shave he said regarding himself in the glass

  in a moment said howard

  the persistent stare ceased the young man closed his
eyes reopened them and with a lean hand extended ad-
vanced on graham then he stopped with his hand
slowly gesticulating and looked about him

  a seat said howard impatiently and in a moment
the flaxen-bearded man had a chair behind graham
sit down please said howard

  graham hesitated and in the other hand of the wild-
eyed man he saw the glint of steel

  dont you understand sire cried the flaxen-bearded
man with hurried politeness he is going to cut your
hair

  oh cried graham enlightened but you called
him-

  a capillotomist-precisely he is one of the finest
artists in the world

  graham sat down abruptly the flaxen-bearded man
disappeared the capillotomist came forward with grace-
ful gestures examined grahams ears and surveyed him
felt the back of his head and would have sat down again
to regard him but for howards audible impatience
forthwith with rapid movements and a succession of
deftly handled implements he shaved grahams chin
clipped his moustache and cut and arranged his hair
all this he did without a word with something of the
rapt air of a poet inspired and as soon as he had fin-
ished graham was handed a pair of shoes

  suddenly a loud voice shouted-it seemed from a piece
of machinery in the corner- at once-at once the
people know all over the city work is being stopped

work is being stopped wait for nothing but come

  this shout appeared to perturb howard exceedingly
by his gestures it seemed to graham that he hesitated
between two directions abruptly he went towards the
corner where the apparatus stood about the little crystal
ball as he did so the undertone of tumultuous
shouting from the archway that had continued during
all these occurrences rose to a mighty sound roared as
if it were sweeping past and fell again as if receding
swiftly it drew graham after it with an irresistible
attraction he glanced at the thickset man and then
obeyed his impulse in two strides he was down the
steps and in the passage and in a score he was out upon
the balcony upon which the three men had been standing

chapter v

the moving ways

he went to the railings of the balcony and stared
upward an exclamation of surprise at his ap-
pearance and the movements of a number of peo-
ple came from the spacious area below

   his first impression was of overwhelming architecture
the place into which he looked was an aisle of titanic
buildings curving spaciously in either direction over-
head mighty cantilevers sprang together across the huge
width of the place and a tracery of translucent material
shut out the sky gigantic globes of cool white light
shamed the pale sunbeams that filtered down through the
girders and wires here and there a gossamer suspen-
sion bridge dotted with foot passengers flung across the
chasm and the air was webbed with slender cables a
cliff of edifice hung above him he perceived as he
glanced upward and the opposite facade was grey and
dim and broken by great archings circular perforations
balconies buttresses turret projections myriads of vast
windows and an intricate scheme of architectural relief
athwart these ran inscriptions horizontally and obliquely
in an unfamiliar lettering here and there close to the
roof cables of a peculiar stoutness were fastened and
dropped in a steep curve to circular openings on the oppo-
site side of the space and even as graham noted these a
remote and tiny figure of a man clad in pale blue arrested
his attention this little figure was far overhead across
the space beside the higher fastening of one of these
festoons hanging forward from a little klge of masonry
and handling some well-nigh invisible strings dependent
from the line then suddenly with a swoop that sent
grahams heart into his mouth this man had rushed
down the curve and vanished through a round opening
on the hither side of the way graham had been looking
up as he came out upon the balcony and the things he
saw above and opposed to him had at first seized his
attention to the exclusion of anything else then sud-
denly he discovered the roadway it was not a roadway
at all as graham understood such things for in the nine-
teenth century the only roads and streets were beaten
tracks of motionless earth jostling rivulets of vehicles
between narrow footways but this roadway was three
hundred feet across and it moved it moved all save the
middle the lowest part for a moment the motion
dazzled his mind then he understood

  under the balcony this extraordinary roadway ran
swiftly to grahams right an endless flow rushing along
as fast as a nineteenth century express train an endless
platform of narrow transverse overlapping slats with
little interspaces that permitted it to follow the curva-
tures of the street upon it were seats and here and
there little kiosks but they swept by too swiftly for him
to see what might be therein from this nearest and
swiftest platform a series of others descended to the
centre of the space each moved to the right each
perceptibly slower than the one above it but the differ-
ence in pace was small enough to permit anyone to step
when the sleeper wakes



you must come avay

from any platform to the one adjacent and so walk
uninterruptedly from the swiftest to the motionless mid-
dle way beyond this middle way was another series of
endless platforms rushing with varying pace to grahams
left and seated in crowds upon the two widest and
swiftest platforms or stepping from one to another down
the steps or swarming over the central space was an
innumerable and wonderfully diversified multitude of
people

  you must not stop here shouted howard suddenly
at his side you must come away at once

  graham made no answer he heard without hearing
the platforms ran with a roar and the people were shout-
ing he perceived women and girls with flowing hair
beautifully robed with bands crossing between the
breasts these first came out of the confusion then
he perceived that the dominant note in that kaleidoscope
of costume was the pale blue that the tailors boy had
worn he became aware of cries of the sleeper what
has happened to the sleeper and it seemed as though
the rushing platforms before him were suddenly spattered
with the pale buffi of human faces and then still more
thickly he saw pointing fingers he perceived that
the motionless central area of this huge arcade just
opposite to the balcony was densely crowded with blue-
clad people some sort of struggle had sprung into life
people seemed to be pushed up the running platforms on
either side and carried away against their will they
would spring off so soon as they were beyond the thick
of the confusion and run back towards the conflict

  it is the sleeper verily it is the sleeper shouted
voices that is never the sleeper shouted others
more and more faces were turned to him at the in-
tervals along this central area graham noted openings
pits apparently the heads of staircases going down with
people ascending out of them and descending into them
the struggle it seemed centered about the one of these
nearest to him people were running down the moving
platforms to this leaping dexterously from platform to
platform the clustering people on the higher platforms
seemed to divide their interest between this point and
the balcony a number of sturdy little figures clad in a
uniform of bright red and working methodically to-
gether were employed it seemed in preventing access to
this descending staircase about them a crowd was rap-
idly accumulating their brilliant color contrasted

vividly with the whitish-blue of their antagonists for the
struggle was indisputable

  he saw these things with howard shouting in his ear
and shaking his arm and then suddenly howard was
gone and he stood alone

  he perceived that the cries of the sleeper grew in
volume and that the people on the nearer platform were
standing up the nearer swifter platform he perceived
was empty to the right of him and far across the space
the platform running in the opposite direction was com-
ing crowded and passing away bare with incredible
swiftness a vast crowd had gathered in the central space
before his eyes a dense swaying mass of people and
the shouts grew from a fitful crying to a voluminous
incessant clamor the sleeper the sleeper and
yells and cheers a waving of garments and cries of
stop the ways they were also crying another name
strange to graham it sounded like ostrog the
slower platforms were soon thick with active people
running against the movement so as to keep themselves
opposite to him

  stop the ways they cried agile figures ran up
swiftly from the centre to the swift road nearest to him
were borne rapidly past him shouting strange unin-
telligible things and ran back obliquely to the central
way one thing he distinguished it is indeed the
sleeper it is indeed the sleeper they testified

  for a space graham stood without a movement then
he became vividly aware that all this concerned him he
was pleased at his wonderful popularity he bowed and
seeking a gesture of longer range waved his arm he was
astonished at the violence of uproar that this provoked
the tumult about the descending stairway rose to furious
violence he became aware of crowded balconies of men
sliding along ropes of men in trapeze-like seats hurling
athwart the space he heard voices behind him a num-
ber of people descending the steps through the archway
he suddenly perceived that his guardian howard was
back again and gripping his arm painfully and shout-
ing inaudibly in his ear

  he turned and howards face was white come back
he heard they will stop the ways the whole city will
be in confusion

  he perceived a number of men hurrying along the
passage of blue pillars behind howard the red-haired
man the man with the flaxen beard a tall man in vivid
vermilion a crowd of others in red carrying staves and
all these people had anxious eager faces

  get him away cried howard

  but why said graham i dont see-

  you must come away said the man in red in a
resolute voice his face and eyes were resolute too
grahams glances went from face to face and he was
suddenly aware of that most disagreeable flavor in life
compulsion some one gripped his arm  he
was being dragged away it seemed as though the
tumult suddenly became two as if half the shouts that
had come in from this wonderful roadway had sprung
into the passages of the great building behind him mar-
velling and confused feeling an impotent desire to resist
graham was half led half thrust along the passage of
blue pillars and suddenly he found himself alone with
howard in a lift and moving swiftly upward

chapter vi

the hall of the atlas

from the moment when the tailor had bowed his fare-
well to the moment when graham found himself in the
lift was altogether barely five minutes and as yet
the haze of his vast interval of sleep hung about him as
yet the initial strangeness of his being alive at all in this
remote age touched everything with wonder with a sense
of the irrational with something of the quality of a


amazing stories quarterly

realistic dream he was still detached an astonished
spectator still but half involved in life what he had
seen and especially the last crowded tumult framed in
the setting of the balcony had a spectacular turn like
a thing witnessed from the box of a theatre i dont
understand he said what was the trouble my mind
is in a whirl why were they shouting what is the
danger

  we have our troubles said howard his eyes
avoided grahams inquiry this is a time of unrest
and in fact your appearance your waking just now
has a sort of connection-

  he spoke jerkily like a man not quite sure of his
breathing he stopped abruptly

  i dont understand said graham

  it will be clearer later said howard

  he glanced uneasily upward as though he found the
progress of the lift slow

  i shall understand better no doubt when i have seen
my way about a little said graham puzzled it will
be-it is bound to be perplexing at present it is all so
strange anything seems possible anything in the
details even your counting i understand is different
the lift stopped and they stepped out into a narrow
but very long passage between high walls along which
ran an extraordinary number of tubes and big cables

  what a huge place this is said graham is it all
one building what place is it

  this is one of the city ways for various public serv-
ices light and so forth

  was it a social trouble-that-in the great roadway
place how are you governed have you still a
police

  several said howard

  several

  about fourteen

  i dont understand

  very probably not our social order will probably
seem very complex to you to tell you the truth i dont
understand it myself very clearly nobody does you
will perhaps-bye and bye we have to go to the coun-
cil

  grahams attention was divided between the urgent
necessity of his inquiries and the people in the passages
and halls they were traversing for a moment his mind
would be concentrated upon howard and the halting
answers he made and then he would lose the thread in
response to some vivid unexpected impression along the
passages in the halls half the people seemed to be men
in the red uniform the pale blue canvas that had been
so abundant in the aisle of moving ways did not appear
invariably these men looked at him and saluted him and
howard as they passed

  he had a clear vision of entering a long corridor and
there were a number of girls sitting on low seats and
as though in a class he saw no teacher but only a
novel apparatus from which he fancied a voice pro-
ceeded the girls regarded him od his conductor he
thought with curiosity and astonishment but he was
hurried on before he could form a clear idea of the
gathering he judged they knew howard and not him-
self and that they wondered who he was this howard
it seemed was a person of importance but then he was
also merely grahams guardian that was odd

  there came a passage in twilight and into this pas-
sage a footway hung so that he could see the feet and
ankles of people going to and fro thereon but no more
of them then vague impressions of galleries and of
casual astonished passers-by turning around to stare
after the two of them with their red-clad guard

  the stimulus of the restoratives he had taken was
only temporary he was speedily fatigued by this ex-
cessive haste he asked howard to slacken his speed
presently he was in a lift that had a window upon the

great street space but this was glazed and did not open
and they were too high for him to see the moving plat-
forms below but he saw people going to and fro along
cables and along strange frail-looking bridges

  and thence they passed across the street and at a
vast height above it they crossed by means of a narrow
bridge closed in with glass so clear that it made him
giddy even to remember it the floor of it also was of
glass from his memory of the cliffs between new quay
and boscastle so remote in time and so recent in his
experience it seemed to him that they must be near four
hundred feet above the moving ways he stopped looked
down between his legs upon the swarming blue and red
multitudes minute and fore-shortened struggling and
gesticulating still towards the little balcony far below
a little toy balcony it seemed where he had so recently
been standing a thin haze and the glare of the mighty
globes of light obscured everything a man seated in
a little open-work cradle shot by from some point still
higher than the little narrow bridge rushing down a
cable as swiftly almost as if he were falling graham
stopped involuntarily to watch this strange passenger
vanish in a great circular opening below and then his
eyes went back to the tumultuous struggle

  along one of the swifter ways rushed a thick crowd of
red spots this broke up into individuals as it approached
the balcony and went pouring down the slower ways
towards the dense struggling crowd on the central area
these men in red appeared to be armed with sticks or
truncheons they seemed to be striking and thrusting
a great shouting cries of wrath screaming burst out
and came up to graham faint and thin go on cried
howard laying hands on him

  another man rushed down a cable graham suddenly
glanced up to see whence he came and beheld through
the glassy roof and the network of cables and girders
dim rhythmically passing forms like the vans of wind-
mills and between them glimpses of a remote and pallid
sky then howard had thrust him forward across the
bridge and he was in a little narrow passage decorated
with geometrical patterns

  i want to see more of that cried graham resisting

  no no cried howard still gripping his arm this
way you must go this way and the men in red fol-
lowing them seemed ready to enforce his orders

  some negroes in a curious wasp-like uniform of black
and yellow appeared down the passage and one hastened
to throw up a sliding shutter that had seemed a door to
graham and led the way through it graham found
himself in a gallery overhanging the end of a great
chamber the attendant in black and yellow crossed this
thrust up a second shutter and stood waiting

this place had the appearance of an ante-room he
saw a number of people in the central space and at
the opposite end a large and imposing doorway at the
top of a flight of steps heavily curtained but giving a
glimpse of some still larger hall beyond he perceived
white men in red and other negroes in black and yellow
standing stiffly about those portals

  as they crossed the gallery he heard a whisper from
below the sleeper and was aware of a turning of
heads a hum of observation they entered another little
passage in the wall of this ante-chamber and then he
found himself on an iron-railed gallery of metal that
passed round the side of the great hall he had already
seen through the curtains he entered the place at the
corner so that he received the fullest impression of its
huge proportions the black in the wasp uniform stood
aside like a well-trained servant and closed the valve
behind him

  compared with any of the places graham had seen thus
far this second hali appeared to be decorated with ex-
treme richness on a pedestal at the remoter end and
when the sleeper wakes



more brilliantly lit than any other object was a gigantic
white figure of atlas strong and strenuous the globe
upon his bowed shoulders it was the first thing to
strike his attention it was so vast so patiently and pain-
fully real so white and simple save for this figure and
for a dais in the centre the wide floor of the place was a
shining vacancy the dais was remote in the greatness
of the area it would have looked a mere slab of metal
had it not been for the group of seven men who stood
about a table on it and gave an inkling of its proportions
they were all dressed in white robes they seemed to have
arisen that moment from their seats and they were
regarding graham steadfastly at the end of the table
he perceived the glitter of some mechanical appliances

  howard led him along the end gallery until they were
opposite this mighty laboring figure then he stopped
the two men in red who had followed them into the gal-
lery came and stood on either hand of graham

  you must remain here murmured howard for a
few moments and without waiting for a reply hurried
away along the gallery

  but why- began graham

  he moved as if to follow howard and found his path
obstructed by one of the men in red you have to
wait here sire said the man in red

 -why

 orders sire

 whose orders

 our orders sire

 graham looked his exasperation

 what place is this he said presently who are
 those men

 they are the lords of the council sire

 what council

 the council

 oh said graham and after an equally ineffectual
 attempt at the other man went to the railing and stared
 at the distant men in white who stood watching him and
 whispering together

 the council he perceived there were now eight
 though how the newcomer had arrived he had not ob-
 served they made no gestures of greeting they stood
 regarding him as in the nineteenth century a group of
 men might have stood in the street regarding a distant
 balloon that had suddenly floated into view what council
 could it be that gathered there that little body of men
 beneath the significant white atlas secluded from every
 eavesdropper in this impressive spaciousness and why
 should he be brought to them and be looked at strangely
 and spoken of inaudibly howard appeared beneath

graham saw the white robed council still standing in a elose group


amazing stories quarterly

 walking quickly across the polished floor towards them
 as he drew near he bowed and performed certain peculiar
 movements apparently of a ceremonious nature then
 he ascended tho steps of the dais and stood by the
 apparatus at the end of the table

  graham watched that visible inaudible conversation
occasionally one of the white-robed men would glance
toward him he strained his ears in vain the gesticu-
lation of two of the speakers became animated he
glanced from them to the passive faces of his attend-
ants    when he looked again howard was ex-
tending his hands and moving his head like a man who
protests he was interrupted it seemed by one of the
white-robed men rapping the table

  the conversation lasted an interminable time to
grahams sense his eyes rose to the still giant at whose
feet the council sat thence they wandered at last to
the walls of the hall it was decorated in long painted
panels of a quasi-japanese type many of them very beau-
tiful these panels were grouped in a great and elabo-
rate framing of dark metal which passed into the metal-
lic caryatidae of the galleries and the great structural
lines of the interior the facile grace of these panels
enhanced the mighty white effort that labored in the
centre of the scheme grahams eyes came back to the
council and howard was descending the steps as he
drew nearer his features could be distinguished and
graham saw that he was flushed and blowing out his
cheeks his countenance was still disturbed when pres-
ently he reappeared along the gallery

  this way he said concisely and they went on in
silence to a little door that opened at their approach
the two men in red stopped on either side of this door
howard and graham passed in and graham glancing
back saw the white-robed council still standing in a close
group and looking at him then the door closed behind
him with a heavy thud and for the first time since his
awakening he was in silence the floor even was noise-
less to his feet

  howard opened another door and they were in the first
of two contiguous chambers furnished in white and green
what council was that began graham what were
they discussing what have they to do with me
howard closed the door carefully heaved a huge sigh and
said something in an undertone he walked slantingways
across the room and turned blowing out his cheeks
again ugh he grunted a man relieved

  graham stood regarding him

  you must understand began howard abruptly
avoiding grahams eyes that our social order is very
complex a half explanation a bare unqualified state-
ment would give you false impressions as a matter of
fact-it is a case of compound interest partly-your
small fortune and the fortune of your cousin warming
which was left to you-and certain other beginnings-
have become very considerable and in other ways that
will be hard for you to understand you have become a
person of significance-of very considerable significance
-involved in the worlds affairs

  he stopped

  yes said graham

  we have grave social troubles

  yes

  things have come to such a pass that in fact it is
advisable to seclude you here

  keep me prisoner exclaimed graham

  well-to ask you to keep in seclusion

  graham turned on him this is strange he said
  no harm will be done you

  no harm

  but you must be kept here-

  while i learn my position i presume

  precisely

  very well then begin why harm

  not now

  why not

   it is too long a story sire

  all the more reason i should begin at once you say
i am a person of importance what was that shouting
i heard why is a great multitude shouting and ex-
cited because my trance is over and who are the men in
white in that huge council chamber

  all in good time sire said howard but not
crudely not crudely this is one of those flimsy times
when no man has a settled mind your awakening no
one expected your awakening the council is consult-
ing

  what council

  the council you saw

   graham made a petulant movement this is not
right he said i should be told what is happening
you must wait really you must wait

  graham sat down abruptly i suppose since i have
waited so long to resume life he said that i must wait
a little longer

  that is better said howard yes that is much bet-
ter and i must leave you alone for a space while
i attend the discussion in the council  i am
sorry

  he went towards the noiseless door hesitated and van-
ished

  graham walked to the door tried it found it securely
fastened in some way he never came to understand
turned about paced the room restlessly made the circuit
of the room and sat down he remained sitting for some
time with folded arms and knitted brow biting his finger
nails and trying to piece together the kaleidoscopic im-
pressions of this first hour of awakened life the vast
mechanical spaces the endless series of chambers and
passages the great struggle that roared and splashed
through these strange ways the little group of remote
unsympathetic men beneath the colossal atlas howards
mysterious behavior there was an inkling of some
vast inheritance already in his mind-a vast inheritance
perhaps misapplied-of some unprecedented importance
and opportunity what had he to do and this rooms
secluded silence was eloquent of imprisonment

 it came into grahams mind with irresistible convic-
tion that this series of magnificent impressions was a
dream he tried to shut his eyes and succeeded but that
time-honored device led to no awakening

  presently he began to touch and examine all the un-
familiar appointments of the two small rooms in which
he found himself

  in a long oval panel of mirror he saw himself and
stopped astonished he was clad in a graceful costume
of purple and bluish white with a little greyshot beard
trimmed to a point and his hair its blackness streaked
now with bands of grey arranged over his forehead in
an unfamiliar but graceful manner he seemed a man of
five-and-forty perhaps for a moment he did not per-
ceive this was himself

  a flash of laughter came with the recognition to
call on old warming like this he exclaimed and make
him take me out to lunch

  then he thought of meeting first one and then another
of the few familiar acquaintances of his early manhood
and in the midst of his amusement realized that every
soul with whom he might jest had died many score of
years ago the thought smote him abruptly and keenly
he stopped short the expression of his face changed to a
white consternation

  the tumultuous memory of the moving platforms and
the huge facade of that wonderful street reasserted itself
the shouting multitudes came back clear and vivid and
those remote inaudible unfriendly councillors in white
he felt himself a little figure very small and ineffectual

pitifully conspicuous and all about him the world was

-strange

chapter vii
in the silent rooms

presently graham resumed his examination of his
apartments curiosity kept him moving in spite of
his fatigue the inner room he perceived was
high and its ceiling dome shaped with an oblong aper-
ture in the centre opening into a funnel in which a
wheel of broad vans seemed to be rotating apparently
driving the air up the shaft the faint humming note
of its easy motion was the only clear sound in that quiet
place as these vans sprang up one after the other
graham could get transient glimpses of the sky he
was surprised to see a star

  this drew his attention to the fact that the bright
lighting of these rooms was due to a multitude of very
faint glow lamps set about the cornices there were no
windows and he began to recall that along all the vast
chambers and passages he had traversed with howard
he had observed no windows at all had there been win-
dows there were windows on the street indeed but
were they for light or was the whole city lit day and
night for evermore so that there was no night there

  and another thing dawned upon him there was no
fireplace in either room was the season summer and
were these merely summer apartments or was the whole
city uniformly heated or cooled he became interested
in these questions began examining the smooth texture
of the walls the simply constructed bed the ingenious
arrangements by which the labor of bedroom service
was practically abolished and over everything was a
curious absence of deliberate ornament a bare grace of
form and color that he found very pleasing to the eye
there were several very comfortable chairs a light table
on silent runners carrying several bottles of fluids and
glasses and two plates bearing a clear substance like
jelly then he noticed there were no books no news-
papers no writing materials the world has changed
indeed he said

  he observed one entire side of the outer room was set
with rows of peculiar double cylinders inscribed with
green lettering on white that harmonized with the deco-
rative scheme of the room and in the centre of this side
projected a little apparatus about a yard square and
having a white smooth face to the room a chair faced
this he had a transitory idea that these cylinders
might be books or a modern substitute for books but
at first it did not seem so

  the lettering on the cylinders puzzled him at first
sight it seemed like russian then he noticed a sugges-
tion of mutilated english about certain of the words

i man huwdbi kiti

forced itself on him as the man who would be king
phonetic spelling he said he remembered reading a
story with that title then he recalled the story vividly
one of the best stories in the world but this thing be-
fore him was not a book as he understood it he puzzled
out the titles of two adjacent cylinders the heart of
darkness he had never heard of before nor the madon-
na of the future-no doubt if they were indeed stories
they were by post victorian authors

  he puzzled over this peculiar cylinder for some time
and replaced it then he turned to the square appa-
ratus and examined that he opened a sort of lid and
found one of the double cylinders within and on the
upper edge a little stud like the stud of an electric bell
he pressed this and a rapid clicking began and ceased
he became aware of voices and music and noticed a
play of color on the smooth front face  he suddenly

realized what this might be and stepped back to regard it

  on the flat surface was now a little picture very
vividly colored and in this picture were figures that
moved not only did they move but they were convers-
ing in clear small voices it was exactly like reality
viewed through an inverted opera glass and heard through
a long tube his interest was seized at once by the
situation which presented a man pacing up and down
and vociferating angry things to a pretty but petulant
woman both were in the picturesque costume that
seemed so strange to graham i have worked said
the man but what have you been doing

  ah said graham he forgot everything else and
sat down in the chair within five minutes he heard him-
self named heard when the sleeper wakes used jest-
ingly as a proverb for remote postponement and passed
himself by a thing remote and incredible but in a
little while he knew those two people like intimate
friends

  at last the miniature drama came to an end and the
square face of the apparatus was blank again

  it was a strange world into which he had been per-
mitted to see unscrupulous pleasure seeking energetic
subtle a world too of dire economic struggle there were
allusions he did not understand incidents that conveyed
strange suggestions of altered moral ideals flashes of
dubious enlightment the blue canvas that bulked so
largely in his first impression of the city ways appeared
again and again as the costume of the common people
he had no doubt the story was contemporary and its
intense realism was undeniable and the end had been
a tragedy that oppressed him he sat staring at the
blankness

  he started and rubbed his eyes he had been so ab-
sorbed in the latter-day substitute for a novel that he
awoke to the little green and white room with more than
a touch of the surprise of his first awakening

  he stood up and abruptly he was back in his own
wonderland the clearness of the kinetoscope drama
passed and the struggle in the vast place of streets
the ambiguous council the swift phases of his waking
hour came back these people had spoken of the council
with suggestions of a vague universality of power and
they had spoken of the sleeper it had not really struck
him vividly at the time that he was the sleeper he
had to recall precisely what they had said   

  he walked into the bedroom and peered up through
the quick intervals of the revolving fan as the fan
swept round a dim turmoil like the noise of machinery
came in rhythmic eddies all else was silence though
the perpetual day still irradiated his apartments he per-
ceived the little intermittent strip of sky was now deep
blue-black almost with a dust of little stars   

  he resumed his examination of the rooms he could
find no way of opening the padded door no bell nor other
means of calling for attendance his feeling of wonder
was in abeyance but he was curious anxious for infor-
mation he wanted to know exactly how he stood to
these new things he tried to compose himself to wait
until someone came to him presently he became rest-
less and eager for information for distraction for fresh
sensations

he went back to the apparatus in the other room
and had soon puzzled out the method of replacing
the cylinders by others as he did so it came into his
mind that it must be these little appliances had fixed
the language so that it was still clear and understand-
able after two hundred years the haphazard cylin-
ders he substituted displayed a musical fantasia at
first it was beautiful and then it was sensuous he
presently recognized what appeared to him to be an
altered version of the story of tannhauser the music
was unfamiliar but the rendering was realistic and


amazing stories quarterly

with a contemporary unfamiliarity tannhauser did
not go to a venusberg but to a pleasure city what
was a pleasure city a dream surely the fancy of
a fantastic voluptuous writer

  he became interested curious the story developed
with a flavor of strangely twisted sentimentality sud-
denly he lid not like it he liked it less as it proceeded

  he had a revulsion of feeling these were no pic-
tures no idealisations but photographed realities he
wanted no more of the twenty-second century venus-
berg he forgot the part played by the model in nine-
teenth century art and gave way to an archaic indig-
nation he rose angry and half ashamed at himself
for witnessing this thing even in solitude he pulled
forward the apparatus and with some violence sought
for a means of stopping its action something snapped
a violet spark stung and convulsed his arm and the
thing was still when he attempted next day to re-
place these tannhauser cylinders by another pair he
found the apparatus broken   

  he struck out a path oblique to the room and paced
to and fro struggling with intolerable vast impres-
sions the things he had derived from the cylinders
and the things he had seen conflicted confused him
it seemed to him the most amazing thing of all that
in his thirty years of life he had never tried to shape
a picture of these coming times we were making
the future he said and hardly any of us troubled
to think what future we were making and here it is

  what have they got to what has been done how
do i come into the midst of it all the vastness of
street and house he was prepared for the multitudes of
people but conflicts in the city ways and the sys-
tematized sensuality of a class of rich men

  he thought of bellamy the hero of whose socialistic
utopia had so oddly anticipated this actual experience
but here was no utopia no socialistic state he had
already seen enough to realize that the ancient antithesis
of luxury waste and sensuality on the one hand and
abject poverty on the other still prevailed he knew
enough of the essential factors of life to understand
that correlation and not only were the buildings of
the city gigantic and the crowds in the street gigantic
but the voices he had heard in the ways the uneasiness
of howard the very atmosphere spoke of gigantic dis-
content what country was he in still england it
seemed and yet strangely un-english his mind
glanced at the rest of the world and saw only an enig-
matical veil

  he prowled about his apartment examining every-
thing as a caged animal might do he felt very tired
felt that feverish exhaustion that does not admit of rest
he listened for long spaces under the ventilator to
catch some distant echo of the tumults he felt must be
proceeding in the city

  he began to talk to himself two hundred and three
years he said to himself over and over again laugh-
ing stupidly then i am two hundred and thirty-three
years old the oldest inhabitant surely they havent
reversed the tendency of our time and gone back to the
rule of the oldest my claims are indisputable mumble
mumble i remember the bulgarian atrocities as though
it was yesterday tis a great age ha ha he was
surprised at first to hear himself laughing and then
laughed again deliberately and louder then he realized
that he was behaving foolishly steady he said
steady i

  his pacing became more regular this new world
he said i dont understand it why    but
it is all why

  i suppose they can fly and do all sorts of things
let me try and remember just how it began

  he was surprised at first to find how vague the mem-

ories of his first thirty years had become he remem-
bered fragments for the most part trivial moments
things of no great importance that he had observed his
boyhood seemed the most accessible at first he recalled
school books and certain lessons in mensuration then
he revived the more salient features of his life memories
of the wife long since dead her magic influence now
gone beyond corruption of his rivals and friends and
betrayers of the swift decision of this issue and that
and then of his last years of misery of fluctuating re-
solves and at last of his strenuous studies in a little
while he perceived he had it all again dim perhaps like
metal long laid aside but in no way defective or injured
capable of re-polishing and the hue of it was a deep-
ening misery was it worth re-polishing by a miracle
he had been lifted out of a life that had become in-
tolerable   

  he reverted to his present condition he wrestled
with the facts in vain it became an inextricable tangle
he saw the sky through the ventilator pink with dawn
an old persuasion came out of the dark recesses of his
memory i must sleep he said it appeared as a
delightful relief from this mental distress and from
the growing pain and heaviness of his limbs he went
to the strange little bed lay down and was presently
asleep   

  he was destined to become very familiar indeed with
these apartments before he left them for he remained
imprisoned for three days during that time no one
except howard entered his prison the marvel of his
fate mingled with and in some way minimized the mar-
vel of his survival he had awakened to mankind it
seemed only to be snatched away into this unaccount-
able solitude howard came regularly with subtly sus-
taining and nutritive fluids and light and pleasant foods
quite strange to graham he always closed the door
carefully a he entered on matters of detail he was in-
creasingly obliging but the bearing of graham on the
great issues that were evidently being contested so
closely beyond the sound-proof walls that enclosed him
he would not elucidate he evaded as politely as pos-
sible every question on the position of affairs in the
outer world

and in those three days grahams incessant thoughts
went far and wide all that he had seen all this
elaborate contrivance to prevent him seeing worked to-
gether in his mind almost every possible interpre-
tation of his position he debated-even as it chanced
the right interpretation things that presently hap-
pened to him came to him at last credible by virtue of
this seclusion when at length the moment of his re-
lease arrived it found him prepared   

  howards bearing went far to deepen grahams im-
pression of his own strange importance the door be-
tween its opening and closing seemed to admit with
him a breath of momentous happening his inquiries
became more definite and searching howard retreated
through protests and difficulties the awakening was
unforeseen he repeated it happened to have fallen in
with the trend of a social convulsion to explain it
i must tell you the history of a gross and a half of years
protested howard

  the thing is this said graham you are afraid
of something i shall do in some way i am arbitrator-
i might be arbitrator

  it is not that but you have-i may tell you this
much-the automatic increase of your property puts
great possibilities of interference in your hands and
in certain other ways you have influence with your
eighteenth century notions

  nineteenth century corrected graham
when the sleeper wakes



  with your old world notions anyhow ignorant as
you are of every feature of our state

  am i a fool

   certaiily not

  do i seem to be the sort of man who would act
rashly

  you were never expected to act at all no one
counted on your awakening no one dreamt you would
ever awake the council had surrounded you with
antiseptic conditions as a matter of fact we thought
that you were dead-a mere arrest of decay and-but
it is too complex we dare not suddenly-while you
are still half awake

  it wont do said graham suppose it is as you
say-why am i not being crammed night and day with
facts and warnings and all the wisdom of the time to
fit me for my responsibilities am i any wiser now
than two days ago if it is two days when i awoke
howard pulled his lip

  i am beginning to feel-every hour i feel more
clearly-a sense of complex concealment of which you
are the salient point is this council or committee
or whatever they are cooking the accounts of my estate
is that it

  that note of suspicion- said howard

  ugh  said graham now mark my words it
will be ill for those who have put me here it will be
ill i am alive make no doubt of it i am alive every
day my pulse is stronger and my mind clearer and more
vigorous no more quiescence i am a man come back
to life and i want to live-

  live

  howards face lit with an idea he came towards
graham and spoke in an easy confidential tone

  the council secludes you here for your good you
are restless naturally-an energetic man you find
it dull here but we are anxious that everything you
may desire-every desire-every sort of desire   
there may be something is there any sort of com-
pany

  he paused meaningly

  yes said graham thoughtfully there is

  ah now we have treated you neglectfully
  the crowds in yonder streets of yours

  that said howard i am afraid- but-
graham began pacing the room howard stood near
the door watching him the implication of howards
suggestion was only half evident to graham company
suppose he were to accept the proposal demand some
sort of company would there be any possibilities
of gathering from the conversation of this additional
person some vague inkling of the struggle that had
broken out so vividly at his waking moment he medi-
tated again and the suggestion took color he turned
on howard abruptly

  what do you mean by company

  howard raised his eyes and shrugged his shoulders
human beings he said with a curious smile on his
heavy face

  our social ideas he said have a certain increased
liberality perhaps in comparison with your times if
a man wishes to relieve such a tedium as this-by
feminine society for instance we think it no scandal
we have cleared our minds of formulfe there is in
our city a class a necessary class no longer despised-
discreet-

  graham stopped dead

  it would pass the time said howard it is a
thing i should perhaps have thought of before but as
a matter of fact so much is happening-

  he indicated the exterior world

  graham hesitated for a moment the figure of a
possible woman that his imagination suddenly created

dominated his mind with an intense attraction then
he flashed into anger

  no he shouted-

  he began striding rapidly up and down the room
everything you say everything you do convinces me
-of some great issue in which i am concerned i do
not want to pass the time as you call it yes i know
desire and indulgence are life in a sense-and death
extinction in my life before i slept i had worked out
that pitiful question i will not begin again there
is a city a multitude- and meanwhile i am here
like a rabbit in a bag

  his rage surged high he choked for a moment and
began to wave his clenched fists he gave way to an
anger fit he swore archaic curses his gestures had
the quality of physical threats

  i do not know who your party may be i am in
the dark and you keep me in the dark but i know
this that i am secluded here for no good purpose for
no good purpose i warn you i warn you of the conse-
quences once i come at my power-

  he realized that to threaten thus might be a danger
to himself he stopped howard stood regarding him
with a curious expression

  i take it this is a message to the council said
howard

  graham had a momentary impulse to leap upon the
man fell or stun him it must have shown upon his
face at any rate howards movement was quick in
a second the noiseless door had closed again and the
man from the nineteenth century was alone

  for a moment he stood rigid with clenched hands
half raised then he flung them down what a fool
i have been he said and gave way to his anger again
stamping about the room and shouting curses   
for a long time he kept himself in a sort of frenzy
raging at his position at his own folly at the knaves
who had imprisoned him he did this because he did
not want to look calmly at his position he clung to
his anger-because he was afraid of fear

  presently he found himself reasoning with himself
this imprisonment was unaccountable but no doubt
the legal forms-new legal forms-of the time permitted
it it must of course be legal these people were two
hundred years further on in the march of civilization
than the victorian generation it was not likely they
would be less-humane yet they had cleared their
minds of formulas was humanity a formula as well
as chastity

  his imagination set to work to suggest things that
might be done to him the attempts of his reason to
dispose of these suggestions though for the most part
logically valid were quite unavailing why should
anything be done to me

  if the worst comes to the worst he found himself
saying at last i can give up what they want but
what do they want and why dont they ask me for
it instead of cooping me up

  he returned to his former preoccupation with the
councils possible intentions he began to reconsider
the details of howards behavior sinister glances in-
explicable hesitations then for a time his mind circled
about the idea of escaping from these rooms but
whither could he escape into this vast crowded world
he would be worse off than a saxon yeoman suddenly
dropped into nineteenth century london and besides
how could anyone escape from these rooms

  how can it benefit anyone if harm should happen
to me

  he thought of the tumult the great social trouble
of which he was so unaccountably the axis a text
irrelevant enough and yet curiously insistent came float-

ing up out of the darkness of his memory this also
a council had said

  it is expedient for us that one man should die for

the roof spaces

as the fans in the circular aperture of the inner room
rotated and permitted glimpses of the night dim
sounds drifted in thereby and graham stand-
ing underneath wrestling darkly with the unknown pow-
ers that imprisoned him and which he had now delib-
erately challenged was startled by the sound of a voice

  he peered up and saw in the intervals of the rota-
tion dark and dim the face and shoulders of a man
regarding him then a dark hand was extended the
swift van struck it swung round and beat on with a
little brownish patch on the edge of its thin blade and
something began to fall therefrom upon the floor drip-
ping silently

  graham looked down and there were spots of blood
at his feet he looked up again in a strange excite-
ment the figure had gone

  he remained motionless-his every sense intent upon
the flickering patch of darkness for outside it was high
night he became aware of some faint remote dark
specks floating lightly through the outer air they
came down towards him fitfully eddyingly and passed
aside out of the uprush from the fan a gleam of light
flickered the specks flashed white and then the darkness
came again warmed and lit as he was he perceived
that it was snowing within a few feet of him

  graham walked across the room and came back to
the ventilator again he saw the head of a man pass
near there was a sound of whispering then a smart
blow on some metallic substance effort voices and the
vans stopped a gust of snowflakes whirled into the
room and vanished before they touched the floor dont
be afraid said a voice

  graham stood under the van who are you he
whispered

  for a moment there was nothing but a swaying of
the fan and then the head of a man was thrust cau-
tiously into the opening his face appeared nearly in-
verted to graham his dark hair was wet with dissolving
flakes of snow upon it his arm went up into the dark-
ness holding something unseen he had a youthful face
and bright eyes and the veins of his forehead were
swollen he seemed to be exerting himself to main-
tain his position

for several seconds neither he nor graham spoke

you were the sleeper said the stranger at last

yes said graham what do you want with me

  i come from ostrog sire

  ostrog

  the man in the ventilator twisted his head round
so that his profile was towards graham he appeared
to be listening suddenly there was a hasty exclama-
tion and the intruder sprang back just in time to escape
the sweep of the released fan and when graham
peered up there was nothing visible but the slowly
falling snow

  it was perhaps a quarter of an hour before anything
returned to the ventilator but at last came the same
metallic interference again the fans stopped and the
face reappeared graham had remained all this time
in the same place alert and tremulously excited

  who are you what do you want he said

  we want to speak to you sire said the intruder
we want-i cant hold the thing we have been try-
ing to find a way to you-these three days

  is it rescue whispered graham escape

  yes sire if you will

  you are my party-the party of the sleeper

  yes sire

  what am i to do said graham

  there was a struggle the strangers arm appeared
and his hand was bleeding his knees came into view
over the edge of the funnel stand away from me
hesaid and he dropped rather heavily on his hands
and one shoulder at grahams feet the released venti-
lator whirled noisily the stranger rolled over sprang
up nimbly and stood panting hand to a bruised shoulder
and with his bright eyes on graham

  you are indeed the sleeper he said i saw you
asleep when it was the law that anyone might see
you

  i am the man who was in the trance said graham
they have imprisoned me here i have been here since
i awoke-at least three days

  the intruder seemed about to speak heard some-
thing glanced swiftly at the door and suddenly left
graham and ran towards it shouting quick incoherent
words a bright wedge of steel flashed in his hand
and he began tap tap a quick succession of blows upon
the hinges mind cried a voice oh the voice
came from above

  graham glanced up saw the soles of two feet ducked
was struck on the shoulder by one of them and a heavy
weight bore him to the earth he fell on his knees
and forward and the weight went over his head he
knelt up and saw a second man from above seated be-
fore him

  i did not see you sire panted the man he rose
and assisted graham to arise are you hurt sire he
panted a succession of heavy blows on the ventilator
began something fell close to grahams face and a
shivering edge of white metal danced fell over and
lay flat upon the floor

  what is this cried graham confused and look-
ing at the ventilator who are you what are you
going to do remember i understand nothing

  stand back said the stranger and drew him from
under the ventilator as another fragment of metal fell
heavily

  we want you to come sire panted the newcomer
and graham glancing at his face again saw a new cut
had changed from white to red on his forehead and a
couple of little trickles of blood started therefrom
your people call for you

  come where my people

  to the hall about the markets your life is in dan-
ger here we have spies we learned but just in time
the council has decided-this very day-either to drug
or kill you and everything is ready the people are
drilled the wind-vane police the engineers and half
the way-gearers are with us we have the halls crowded
-shouting the whole city shouts against the council
we have arms he wiped the blood with his hand
your life here is not worth-

  but why arms

the people have risen to protect you sire what
he turned quickly as the man who had first come down
made a hissing with his teeth graham saw the latter
start back gesticulate to them to conceal themselves
and move as if to hide behind the opening door

  as he did so howard appeared a little tray in one
hand and his heavy face downcast he started looked
up the door slammed behind him the tray tilted side-
ways and the steel wedge struck him behind the ear
he went down like a felled tree and lay as he fell
athwart the floor of the outer room the man who had
struck him bent hastily studied his face for a moment
rose and returned to his work at the door

  your poison said a voice in grahams ear
when the sleeper wakes



then abruptly they were in darkness the innum-
erable cornice lights had been extinguished gra-
ham saw the aperture of the ventilator with ghostly snow
whirling above it and dark figures moving hastily three
knelt on the van some dim thing-a ladder-was being
lowered through the opening and a hand appeared hold-
ing a fitful yellow light

  he had a moment of hesitation but the manner
of these men their swift alacrity their words marched
so completely with his own fears of the council with
his idea and hope of a rescue that it lasted not a moment
and his people awaited him

  i do not understand he said i trust tell me what
to do

  the man with the cut brow gripped grahams arm
clamber up the ladder he whispered quick they
will have heard-

  graham felt for the ladder with extended hands put
his foot on the lower rung and turning his head saw
over the shoulder of the nearest man in the yellow
flicker of the light the first-comer astride over howard
and still working at the door graham turned to the lad-
der again and was thrust by his conductor and helped
up by those above and then he was standing on some-
thing hard and cold and slippery outside the ventilating
funnel

  he shivered he was aware of a great difference in
the temperature half a dozen men stood about him
and light flakes of snow touched hands and face and
melted for a moment it was dark then for a flash a
ghastly violet white and then everything was dark
again	

  he saw he had come out upon the roof of the vast
city structure which had replaced the miscellaneous
houses streets and open spaces of victorian london
the place upon which he stood was level with huge
serpentine cables lying athwart it in every direction
the circular wheels of a number of windmills loomed
indistinct and gigantic through the darkness and snow-
fall and roared with a varying loudness as the fitful
wind rose and fell some way off an intermittent white
light smote up from below touched the snow eddies with
a transient glitter and made an evanescent spectre in
the night and here and there low down some vaguely
outlined wind-driven mechanism flickered with livid
sparks

  all this he appreciated in a fragmentary manner as
his rescuers stood about him someone threw a thick
soft cloak of fur-like texture about him and fastened
it by buckled straps at waist and shoulders things
were said briefly decisively someone thrust him for-
ward

  before his mind was yet clear a dark shape gripped
his arm this way said this shape urging him
along and pointed graham across the flat roof in the
direction of a dim semicircular haze of light graham
obeyed

  hindi said a voice as graham stumbled against
a cable between them and not across them said the
voice and we must hurry

  where are the people said graham the people
you said awaited me

  the stranger did not answer he left grahams arm
as the path grew narrower and led the way with rapid
strides graham followed blindly in a minute he found
himself running are the others coming he panted
but received no reply his companion glanced back
and ran on they came to a sort of pathway of open
metal-work transverse to the direction they had come
and they turned aside to follow this graham looked
back but the snowstorm had hidden the others

  come on i said his guide running now they drew
near a little windmill spinning high in the air stoop

said grahams guide and they avoided an endless band
running roaring up to the shaft of the vane this way
and they were ankle deep in a gutter full of drifted
thawing snow between two low walls of metal that pres-
ently rose waist high i will go first said the guide
graham drew his cloak about him and followed then
suddenly came a narrow abyss across which the gutter
leapt to the snowy darkness of the further side graham
peeped over the side once and the gulf was black for
a moment he regretted his flight he dared not look
again and his brain spun as he waded through the half
liquid snow

  then out of the gutter they clambered and hurried
across a wide flat space damp with thawing snow and
for half its extent dimly translucent to lights that went
to and fro underneath he hesitated at this unstable
looking substance but his guide ran on unheeding and
so they came to and clambered up slippery steps to the
rim of a great dome of glass round this they went
far below a number of people seemed to be dancing and
music filtered through the dome    graham fan-
cied he heard a shouting through the snowstorm and
his guide hurried him on with a new spurt of haste
they clambered panting to a space of huge windmills
one so vast that only the lower edge of its vans came
rushing into sight and rushed up again and was lost
in the night and the snow they hurried for a time
through the colossal metallic tracery of its supports and
came at last above a place of moving platforms like
the place into which graham had looked from the bal-
cony they crawled across the sloping transparency that
covered this street of platforms crawling on hands and
knees because of the slipperiness of the snowfall

  for the most part the glass was bedewed and gra-
ham saw only hazy suggestions of the forms below
but near the pitch of the transparent roof the glass was
clear and he found himself looking sheerly down upon
it all for awhile in spite of the urgency of his guide
he gave way to vertigo and lay spread-eagled on the
glass sick and paralyzed far below mere stirring
specks and dots went the people of the unsleeping city
in their perpetual daylight and the moving platforms
ran on their incessant journey messengers and men
on unknown businesses shot along the drooping cables
and the frail bridges were crowded with men it was
like peering into a gigantic glass hive and it lay verti-
cally below him with only a tough glass of unknown
thickness to save him from a fall the street showed
warm and lit and graham was wet now to the skin
with thawing snow and his feet were numbed with cold
for a space he could not move come on i cried his
guide with terror in his voice come on

  graham reached the pitch of the roof by an effort

  over the ridge following his guides example he
turned about and slid backward down the opposite slope
very swiftly amid a little avalanche of snow while
he was sliding he thought of what would happen if some
broken gap should come in his way at the edge he
stumbled to his feet ankle deep in slush thanking heaven
for an opaque footing again his guide was already
clambering up a metal screen to a level expanse

  through the spare snowflakes above this loomed an-
other line of vast windmills and then suddenly the
amorphous tumult of the rotating wheels was pierced
with a deafening sound it was a mechanical shrilling
of extraordinary intensity that seemed to come simul-
taneously from every point of the compass

  they have missed us already cried grahams guide
in an accent of terror and suddenly with a blinding
flash the night became day

  above the driving snow from the summits of the
wind-wheels appeared vast masts carrying globes of
livid light they receded in illimitable vistas in every

direction as far as his eye could penetrate the snow-
fall they glared

  get on this cried grahams conductor and thrust
him forward to a long grating of snowless metal that
ran like a band between two slightly sloping expanses
of snow it felt warm to grahams benumbed feet and
a faint eddy of steam rose from it

  come  shouted his guide ten yards off and
without waiting ran swiftly through the incandescent
glare towards the iron supports of the next range of
wind-wheels graham recovering from his astonish-
ment followed as fast convinced of his imminent cap-
ture   

  in a score of seconds they were within a tracery of
glare and black shadows shot with moving bars beneath
the monstrous wheels grahams conductor ran on for
some time and suddenly darted sideways and vanished
into a black shadow in the corner of the foot of a huge
support in another moment graham was beside him

  they cowered panting and stared out

the scene upon which graham looked was very wild
and strange the snow had now almost ceased

only a belated flake passed now and again across the pic-
ture but the broad stretch of level before them was
a ghastly white broken only by gigantic masses and
moving shapes and lengthy strips of impenetrable dark-
ness vast ungainly titans of shadow all about them
huge metallic structures iron girders inhumanly vast
as it seemed to him interlaced and the edges of wind-
wheels scarcely moving in the lull passed in great shin-
ing curves steeper and steeper up into a luminous haze
wherever the snow-spangled light struck down beams
and girders and incessant bands running with a halting
indomitable resolution passed upward and downward
into the black and with all that mighty activity with
an omnipresent sense of motive and design this snow-
clad desolation of mechanism seemed void of all human
presence save themselves seemed as trackless and de-
serted and unfrequented by men as some inaccessible
alpine snowfield s

  they will bcnasing us cried the leader we
are scarcelylkiifway there yet cold as it is we must
hide herotor a space-at least until it snows more
thickly again

  his teeth chattered in his head

clamber up the ladder-quick
when the sleeper wakes



  where are the markets asked graham staring out
where are all the people

  the other made no answer

  look whispered graham crouched close and be-
came very still

  the snow had suddenly become thick again and slid-
ing with the whirling eddies out of the black pit of the
sky came something vague and large and very swift
it came down in a steep curve and swept round wide
wings extended and a trail of white condensing steam
behind it rose with an easy swiftness and went gliding
up the air swept horizontally forward in a wide curve
and vanished again in the steaming specks of snow
and through the ribs of its body graham saw two little
men very minute and active searching the snowy areas
about him as it seemed to him with field glasses for
a second they were clear then hazy through a thick whirl
of snow then small and distant and in a minute they
were gone

  now cried his companion come

  he pulled grahams sleeve and incontinently the two
were running headlong down the arcade of ironwork be-
neath the wind-wheels graham running blindly col-
lided with his leader who had turned back on him sud-
denly he found himself within a dozen yards of a
black chasm it extended as far as he could see right
and left it seemed to cut off their progress in either
direction

  do as i do whispered his guide he lay down and
crawled to the edge thrust his head over and twisted
until one leg hung he seemed to feel for something
with his foot found it and went sliding over the edge
into the gulf his head reappeared it is a ledge
he whispered in the dark all the way along do as
i did

  graham hesitated went down upon all fours crawled
to the edge and peered into a velvety blackness for a
sickly moment he had courage neither to go on nor re-
treat then he sat and hung his leg down felt his guides
hands pulling at him had a horrible sensation of sliding
over the edge into the unfathomable splashed and felt
himself in a slushy gutter impenetrably dark

  this way whispered the voice and he began
crawling along the gutter through the trickling thaw
pressing himself against the wall they continued along
it for some minutes he seemed to pass through a hun-
dred stages of misery to pass minute after minute
through a hundred degrees of cold damp and exhaus-
tion in a little while he ceased to feel his hands and
feet

  the gutter sloped downwards he observed that they
were now many feet below the edge of the buildings
rows of spectral white shapes like the ghosts of blind-
drawn windows rose above them they came to the
end of a cable fastened above one of these white win-
dows dimly visible and dropping into impenetrable
shadows suddenly his hand came against his guides
still whispered the latter very softly

  he looked up with a start and saw the huge wings
of the flying machine gliding slowly and noiselessly
overhead athwart the broad band of snow-flecked grey-
blue sky in a moment it was hidden again

  keep still they were just turning

  for awhile both were motionless then grahams com-
panion stood up and reaching towards the fastenings of
the cable fumbled with some indistinct tackle

  what is that asked graham

  the only answer was a faint cry the man crouched
motionless graham peered and saw his face dimly he
was staring down the long ribbon of sky and graham
following his eyes saw the flying machine small and
faint and remote then he saw that the wings spread
on either side that it headed towards them that every

moment it grew larger it was following the edge of
the chasm towards them

  the mans movements became convulsive he thrust
two cross bars into grahams hand graham could not
see them he ascertained their form by feeling they
were slung by thin cords to the cable on the cord
were hand grips of some soft elastic substance put the
cross between your legs whispered the guide hyster-
ically and grip the holdfasts grip tightly grip
graham did as he was told

  jump said the voice in heavens name jump
for one momentous second graham could not speak
he was glad afterwards that darkness hid his face he
said nothing he began to tremble violently he looked
sideways at the swift shadow that swallowed up the sky
as it rushed upon him

  jump jump-in gods name or they will have
us cried grahams guide and in the violence of his
passion thrust him forward

  graham tottered convulsively gave a sobbing cry a
cry in spite of himself and then as the flying machine
swept over them fell forward into the pit of that dark-
ness seated on the cross wood and holding the ropes
with the clutch of death something cracked something
rapped smartly against a wall he heard the pulley of
the cradle hum on its rope he heard the aeronauts
shout he felt a pair of knees digging into his back
 he was sweeping headlong through the air fall-
ing through the air all his strength was in his hands
he would have screamed but he had no breath

  he shot into a blinding light that made him grip
the tighter he recognized the great passage with the
running ways the hanging lights and interlacing gir-
ders they rushed upward and by him he had a
momentary impression of a great circular aperture
yawning to swallow him up

  he was in the dark again falling falling gripping
with aching hands and behold a clap of sound a burst
of light and he was in a brightly lit hall with a roaring
multitude of people beneath his feet the people his
people a proscenium a stage rushed up towards him
and his cable swept down to a circular aperture to the
right of this he felt he was travelling slower and
suddenly very much slower he distinguished shouts
of saved the master he is safe the stage rushed
up towards him with rapidly diminishing swiftness
then-

  he heard the man clinging behind him shout as if
suddenly terrified and this shout was echoed by a shout
from below he felt that he was no longer gliding along
the cable but falling with it there was a tumult of
yells screams and cries he felt something soft against
his extended hand and the impact of a broken fall quiv-
ering through his arm   

  he wanted to be still and the people were lifting him
he believed afterwards he was carried to the platform
and given some drink but he was never sure he did
not notice what became of his guide when his mind
was clear again he was on his feet eager hands were
assisting him to stand he was in a big alcove occupy-
ing the position that in his previous experience had been
devoted to the lower boxes if this was indeed a theatre

  a mighty tumult was in his ears a thunderous roar
the shouting of a countless multitude it is the sleeper
the sleeper is with us

  the sleeper is with us the master-the owner
the master is with us he is safe

  graham had a surging vision of a great hall crowded
with people he saw no individuals he was conscious
of a froth of pink faces of waving arms and garments
he felt the occult influence of a vast crowd pouring over
him buoying him up there were balconies galleries
great archways giving remoter perspectives and every-
where people a vast arena of people densely packed and

cheering across the nearer space lay the collapsed
cable like a huge snake it had been cut by the men of
the flying machine at its upper end and had crumpled
down into the hall men seemed to be hauling this out
of the way but the whole effect was vague the very
buildings throbbed and leapt with the roar of the voices

  he stood unsteadily and looked at those about him
someone supported him by one arm let me go into
a little room he said weeping a little room and
could say no more a man in black stepped forward
took his disengaged arm he was aware of officious men
opening a door before him someone guided him to a
seat he staggered he sat down heavily and covered
his face with his hands he was trembling violently his
nervous control was at an end he was relieved of his
cloak he could not remember how his purple hose he
saw were black with wet people were running about
him things were happening but for some time he gave
no heed to them

  he had escaped a myriad of cries told him that
he was safe these were the people who were on his
side for a space he sobbed for breath and then he sat
still with his face covered the air was full of the
shouting of innumerable men

chapter ix
the people march

he became aware of someone urging a glass of clear
fluid upon his attention looked up and discovered
this was a dark young man in a yellow garment
he took the dose forthwith and in a moment he was
glowing a tall man in a black robe stood by his
shoulder and pointed to the half open door into the hall
this man was shouting close to his ear and yet what was
said was indistinct because of the tremendous uproar
from the great theatre behind the man was a girl in a
silvery grey robe whom graham even in this confusion
perceived to be beautiful her dark eyes full of wonder
end curiosity were fixed on him her lips trembled apart
a partially opened door gave a glimpse of the crowded
hall and admitted a vast uneven tumult a hammering
clapping and shouting that died away and began again
and rose to a thunderous pitch and so continued inter-
mittently all the time that graham remained in the little
room he watched the lips of the man in black and gath-
ered that he was making some clumsy explanation

  he stared stupidly for some moments at these things
and then stood up abruptly he grasped the arm of this
shouting person

  tell me he cried who am i who am i

  the others came nearer to hear his words who am
i his eyes searched their faces

  they have told him nothing cried the girl

  tell me tell me cried graham

  you are the master of the earth you are owner of
half the world

  he did not believe he heard aright he resisted the
persuasion he pretended not to understand not to hear
he lifted his voice again i have been awake three days
-a prisoner three days i judge there is some struggle
between a number of people in this city-it is london
yes said the younger man

  and those who meet in the great hall with the white
atlas how does it concern me in some way it has
to do with me why i dont know drugs it seems
to me that while i have slept the world has gone mad
i have gone mad

  who are those councillors under the atlas why
should they try to drug me

  to keep you insensible said the man in yellow
to prevent your interference

 but why

  because you are the atlas sire said the man in

yellow the world is on your shoulders they rule it
in your name

  the sounds from the hall had died into a silence
threaded by one monotonous voice now suddenly tramp-
ling on these last words came a deafening tumult a
roaring and thundering cheer crowded on cheer voices
hoarse and shrill beating overlapping and while it lasted
the people in the little room could not hear each other
shout

  graham stood his intelligence clinging helplessly to
the thing he had just heard the council he repeated
blankly and then snatched at a name that had struck
him but who is ostrog he said

  he is the organizer-the orgarizer of the revolt our
leader-in your name

  in my name- and you why is he not here
he-has deputed us i am his brother-his half-
brother lincoln he wants you to show yourself to
these people and then come on to him that is why he
has sent us he is at the wind-vane offices directing the
people are marching

  in your name shouted the younger man they
have ruled crushed tyrannized at last even-

  in my name my name master

  the younger man suddenly became audible in a pause
of the outer thunder indignant and vociferous a high
penetrating voice under his red aquiline nose and bushy
moustache no one expected you to wake no one
expected you to wake they were cunning damned
tyrants but they were taken by surprise they did
not know whether to drug you hypnotize you kill you
again the hall dominated everything

  ostrog is at the wind-vane offices ready- even
now there is a rumor of fighting beginning

  the man who had called himself lincoln came close to
him ostrog has it planned trust him we have our
organizations ready we shall seize the flying stages-
even now he may be doing that then-

  this public theatre bawled the man in yellow is
only a contingent we have five myriads of drilled
men-

  we have arms cried lincoln we have plans a
leader their police have gone from the streets and are
massed in the- inaudible it is now or never
the council is rocking- they cannot trust even their
drilled men-

  hear the people calling to you

  grahams mind was like a night of moon and swift
clouds now dark and hopeless now clear and ghastly
he was master of the earth he was a man sodden with
thawing snow of all his fluctuating impressions the
dominant ones presented an antagonism on the one
hand was the white council powerful disciplined few
the white council from which he had just escaped and
on the other monstrous crowds packed masses of indis-
tinguishable people clamoring his name hailing him
master the other side had imprisoned him debated his
death these shouting thousands beyond the little door-
way had rescued him but why these things should be
so he could not understand

  the door opened lincolns voice was swept away and
drowned and a rush of people followed on the heels of
the tumult these intruders came towards him and lin-
coln gesticulating the voices without explained their
soundless lips show us the sleeper show us the
sleeper was the burden of the uproar men were
bawling for order silence

  graham glanced towards the open doorway and saw
a tall oblong picture of the hall beyond a waving in-
cessant confusion of crowded shouting faces men and
women together waving pale blue garments extended
hands many were standing one man in rags of dark
brown a gaunt figure stood on the seat and waved a
black cloth he met the wonder and expectation of the
when the sleeper wakes



girls eyes what did these people expect from him
he was dimly aware that the tumult outside had changed
its character was in some way beating marching his
own mind too changed for a space he did not recog-
nize the influence that was transforming him but a
moment that was near to panic passed he tried to
make audible inquiries of what was required of him

  lincoln was shouting in his ear but graham was
deafened to that all the others save the woman ges-
ticulated towards the hall he perceived what had hap-
pened to the uproar the whole mass of people was
chanting together it was not simply a song the voices
were gathered together and upborne by a torrent of in-
strumental music music like the music of an organ a
woven texture of sounds full of trumpets full of flaunt-
ing banners full of the march and pageantry of opening
war and the feet of the people were beating time-
tramp tramp

  he was urged towards the door he obeyed mechanic-
ally the strength of that chant took hold of him stirred
him emboldened him the hall opened to him a vast
welter of fluttering color swaying to the music

  wave your arm to them said lincoln wave your
arm to them

  this said a voice on the other side he must have
this arms were about his neck detaining him in the
doorway and a black subtly-folding mantle hung from
his shoulders he threw his arm free of this and fol-
lowed lincoln he perceived the girl in grey close to
him her face lit her gesture onward for the instant
she became to him flushed and eager as she was an em-
bodiment of the song he emerged in the alcove again
incontinently the mounting waves of the song broke upon
his appearing and flashed up into a foam of shouting
guided by lincolns hand he marched obliquely across the
centre of the stage facing the people

the hall was a vast and intricate space-galleries
balconies broad spaces of amphitheatral steps and
great archways far away high up seemed the mouth
of a huge passage full of struggling humanity the
whole multitude was swaying in congested masses in-
dividual figures sprang out of the tumult impressed him
momentarily and lost definition again close to the
platform swayed a beautiful fair woman carried by
three men her hair across her face and brandishing a
green staff next this group an old careworn man in blue
canvas maintained his place in the crush with difficulty
and behind shouted a hairless face a great cavity of
toothless mouth a voice called that enigmatical word
ostrog all his impressions were vague save the mas-
sive emotion of that trampling song the multitude
were beating time with their feet-marking time tramp
tramp tramp tramp the green weapons waved
flashed and slanted then he saw those nearest to him
on a level space before the stage were marching in front
of him passing towards a great archway shouting to
the council tramp tramp tramp tramp he raised
his arm and the roaring was redoubled he remembered
he had to shout march his mouth shaped inaudible
heroic words he waved his arm again and pointed to
the archway shouting onward they were no longer
marking time they were marching tramp tramp tramp
tramp in that host were bearded men old men youths
fluttering robed bare-armed women girls men and
women of the new age i rich robes grey rags fluttered
together in the whirl of their movement amidst the domi-
nant blue a monstrous black banner jerked its way
to the right he perceived a blue-clad negro a shrivelled
woman in yellow then a group of tall fair-haired white-
faced blue-clad men pushed theatrically past him he
noted two chinamen a tall sallow dark-haired shining-
eyed youth white clad from top to toe clambered up

towards the platform shouting loyally and sprang down
again and receded looking backward heads shoulders
hands clutching weapons all were swinging with those
marching cadences

  faces came out of the confusion to him as he stood
there eyes met his and passed and vanished men ges-
ticulated to him shouted inaudible personal things
most of the faces were flushed but many were ghastly
white and disease was there and many a hand that
waved to him was gaunt and lean men and women of
the new age strange and incredible meeting as the
broad stream passed before him to the right tributary
gangways from the remote uplands of the hall thrust
downward in an incessant replacement of people tramp
tramp tramp tramp the unison of the song was en-
riched and complicated by the massive echoes of arches
and passages men and women mingled in the ranks
tramp tramp tramp tramp the whole world seemed
marching tramp tramp tramp tramp his brain was
tramping the garments waved onward the faces
poured by more abundantly

  tramp tramp tramp tramp at lincolns pressure he
turned towards the archway walking unconsciously in
that rhythm scarcely noticing his movement for the
melody and stir of it the multitude the gesture and
song all moved in that direction the flow of people smote
downward until the upturned faces ware below the level
of his feet he was aware of a path before him of
a suite about him of guards and dignitaries and lincoln
on his right hand attendants intervened and ever and
again blotted out the sight of the multitude to the left
before him went the backs of the guards in black-
three and three and three he was marched along a
little railed way and crossed above the archway with
the torrent dipping to flow beneath and shouting up to
him he did not know whither he went he did not want
to know he glanced back across a flaming spaciousness
of hall tramp tramp tramp tramp

 chapter x

the battle of the darkness

he was no longer in the hall he was marching
along a gallery overhanging one of the great
streets of the moving platforms that traversed the
city before him and behind him tramped his guards
the whole concave of the moving ways below was a
congested mass of people marching tramping to the left
shouting waving hands and arms pouring along a huge
vista shouting as they came into view shouting as they
passed shouting as they receded until the globes of elec-
tric light receding in perspective dropped down it seemed
and hid the swarming bare heads tramp tramp tramp
tramp

  the song roared up to graham now no longer upborne
by music but coarse and noisy and the beating of the
marching feet tramp tramp tramp tramp interwove
with a thunderous irregularity of footsteps from the
undisciplined rabble that poured along the higher ways
abruptly he noted a contrast the buildings on the
opposite side of the way seemed deserted the cables
and bridges that laced across the aisle were empty and
shadowy it came into grahams mind that these also
should have swarmed with people

  he felt a curious emotion-throbbing-very fast he
stopped again the guards before him marched on
those about him stopped as he did he saw the direction
of their faces the throbbing had something to do with
the lights he too looked up

  at first it seemed to him a thing that affected the lights
simply an isolated phenomenon having no bearing on
the things below each huge globe of blinding white-
ness was as it were clutched compressed in a systole that


amazing stories quarterly

was followed by a transitory diastole and again a systole
like a tightening grip darkness light darkness in rapid
alternation

  graham became aware that this strange behavior of
the lights had to do with the people below the appear-
ance of the houses and ways the appearance of the
packed masses changed became a confusion of vivid
lights and leaping shadows he saw a multitude of
shadows had sprung into aggressive existence seemed
rushing up broadening widening growing with steady
swiftness-to leap suddenly back and return reinforced
the song and the tramping had ceased the unanimous
march he discovered was arrested there were eddies a
flow sideways shouts of the lights voices were
crying together one thing the lights cried these
voices the lights he looked down in this danc-
ing death of the lights the area of the street had sud-
denly become a monstrous struggle the huge white
globes became purple-white purple with a reddish glow
flickered flickered faster and faster fluttered between
light and extinction ceased to flicker and became mere
fading specks of glowing red in a vast obscurity in ten
seconds the extinction was accomplished and there was
only this roaring darkness a black monstrosity that had
suddenly swallowed up those glittering myriads of men

  he felt invisible forms about him his arms were
gripped something rapped sharply against his shin
a voice bawled in his ear it is all right-all right
graham shook off the paralysis of his first astonish-
ment he struck his forehead against lincolns and
bawled what is this darkness

  the council has cut the currents that light the city
we must wait-stop the people will go on they will-
his voice was drowned voices were shouting save
the sleeper take care of the sleeper a guard
stumbled against graham and hurt his hand by an in-
advertent blow of his weapon a wild tumult tossed
and whirled about him growing as it seemed louder
denser more furious each moment fragments of recog-
nizable sounds drove towards him were whirled away
from him as his mind reached out to grasp them voices
seemed to be shouting conflicting orders other voices
answered there were suddenly a succession of piercing
screams close beneath them

  a voice bawled in his ear the red police and
receded forthwith beyond his questions

  a crackling sound grew to distinctness and therewith
a leaping of faint flashes along the edge of the further
ways by their light graham saw the heads and bodies
of a number of men armed with weapons like those of
his guards leap into an instants dim visibility the
whole area began to crackle to flash with little instant-
aneous streaks of light and abruptly the darkness rolled
back like a curtain

  a glare of light dazzled his eyes a vast seething ex-
panse of struggling men confused his mind a shout
a burst of cheering came across the ways he looked
up to see the source of the light a man hung far over-
head from the upper part of a cable holding by a rope
the blinding star that had driven the darkness back
he wore a red uniform

  grahams eyes fell to the ways again a wedge of red
a little way along the vista caught his eye he saw it
was a dense mass of red-clad men jammed on the higher
further way their backs against the pitiless cliff of build-
ing and surrounded by a dense crowd of antagonists
they were fighting weapons flashed and rose and fell
heads vanished at the edge of the contest and other heads
replaced them the little flashes from the green weapons
became little jets of smoky grey while the light lasted

abruptly the flare was extinguished and the ways
were an inky darkness once more a tumultuous
mystery

  he felt something thrusting against him he was being
pushed along the gallery someone was shouting-it
might be at him he was too confused to hear he
was thrust against the wall and a number of people
blundered past him it seemed to him that his guards
were struggling with one another

  suddenly the cable-hung star-holder appeared again
and the whole scene was white and dazzling the band
of red-coats seemed broader and nearer its apex was
half-way down the ways towards the central aisle and
raising his eyes graham saw that a number of these
men had also appeared now in the darkened lower gal-
leries of the opposite building and were firing over the
heads of their fellows below at the boiling confusion of
people on the lower ways the meaning of these things
dawned upon him the march of the people had come
upon an ambush at the very outset thrown into con-
fusion by the extinction of the lights they were now
being attacked by the red police then he became aware
that he was standing alone that his guards and lincoln
were along the gallery in the direction along which he
had come before the darkness fell he saw they were
gesticulating to him wildly running back towards him

a great shouting came from across the ways then it
seemed as though the whole face of the darkened build-
ing opposite was lined and speckled with red-clad men
and they were pointing over to him and shouting the
sleeper save the sleeper shouted a multitude of
throats

  something struck the wall above his head he looked
up at the impact and saw a star-shaped splash of silvery
metal he saw lincoln near him felt his arm gripped
then pat pat he had been missed twice

  for a moment he did not understand this the street
was hidden everything was hidden as he looked the
second flare had burned out

  lincoln had gripped graham by the arm was lugging
him along the gallery before the next light he cried
his haste was contagious grahams instinct of self-
preservation overcame the paralysis of his incredulous
astonishment he became for a time the blind creature
of the fear of death he ran stumbling because of the
uncertainty of the darkness blundered into his guards
as they turned to run with him haste was his one desire
to escape this perilous gallery upon which he was ex-
posed a third glare came close on its predecessors
with it came a great shouting across the ways an an-
swering tumult from the ways the red-coats below
he saw had now almost gained the central passage
their countless faces turned towards him and they
shouted the white facade opposite was densely stippled
with red all these wonderful things concerned him
turned upon him as a pivot these were the guards of
the council attempting to recapture him

  lucky it was for him that these shots were the first
fired in anger for a hundred and fifty years he heard
bullets whacking over his head felt a splash of molten
metal sting his ear and perceived without looking that
the whole opposite facade an unmasked ambuscade of
red police was crowded and bawling and firing at him

  down went one of his guards before him and graham
unable to stop leapt the writhing body

  in another second he had plunged unhurt into a black 
passage and incontinently someone coming it may be
in a transverse direction blundered violently into him

he was hurling down a staircase in absolute darkness

he reeled and was struck again and came against a
wall with his hands he was crushed by a weight of
struggling bodies whirled round and thrust to the right

a vast pressure pinned him he could not breathe his
ribs seemed cracking he felt a momentary relaxation
and then the whole mass of people moving together bore
him back towards the great theatre from which he had
so recently come there were moments when his feet
when the sleeper wakes



did not touch the ground then he was staggering and
shoving he heard shouts of they are coming and a
muffled cry close to him his foot blundered against
something soft he heard a hoarse scream under foot he
heard shouts of the sleeper but he was too confused
to speak he heard the green weapons crackling for
a space he lost his individual will became an atom in a
panic blind unthinking mechanical he thrust and
pressed back and writhed in the pressure kicked pres-
ently against a step and found himself ascending a slope
and abruptly the faces all about him leapt out of the
black visible ghastly-white and astonished terrified
perspiring in a livid glare one face a young mans
was very near to him not twenty inches away at the
time it was but a passing incident of no emotional value
but afterwards it came back to him in his dreams for
this young man wedged upright in the crowd for a time
had been shot and was already dead

  a fourth white star must have been lit by the man on
the cable its light came glaring in through vast win-
dows and arches and showed graham that he was now
one of a dense mass of flying black figures pressed back
across the lower area of the great theatre this time
the picture was livid and fragmentary slashed and
barred with black shadows he saw that quite near to

him the red guards were fighting their way through the
people he could not tell whether they saw him he
looked for lincoln and his guards he saw lincoln near
the stage of the theatre surrounded in a crowd of black-
badged revolutionaries lifted up and staring to and fro
as if seeking him graham perceived that he himself
was near the opposite edge of the crowd that behind him
separated by a barrier sloped the now vacant seats of the
theatre a sudden idea came to him and he began fight-
ing his way towards the barrier as he reached it the
glare came to an end

  in a moment he had thrown off the great cloak that
not only impeded his movements but made him con-
spicuous and had slipped it from his shoulders he
heard someone trip in its folds in another he was
scaling the barrier and had dropped into the blackness
on the further side then feeling his way he came to
the lower end of an ascending gangway in the darkness
the sound of firing ceased and the roar of feet and voices
lulled then suddenly he came to an unexpected step
and tripped and fell as he did so pools and islands
amidst the darkness about him leapt to vivid light again
the uproar surged louder and the glare of the fifth white
star shone through the vast fenestrations of the theatre
walls

a wild tumult tossed and whirled about him

moment the man stood still

   he rolled over among some seats heard a shouting an
the whirring rattle of weapons struggled up and was
knocked back again perceived that a number of black-
badged men were all about him firing at the reds below
leaping from seat to seat crouching among the seats to
reload instinctively he crouched amidst the seats as
stray shots ripped the pneumatic cushions and cut
bright slashes on their soft metal frames instinctively
he marked the direction of the gangways the most
plausible way of escape for him so soon as the veil of
darkness fell again

  a young man in faded blue garments came vaulting
over the seats hullo he said with his flying feet
within six inches of the crouching sleepers face

   he stared without any sign of recognition turned to
fire fired and shouting to hell with the council
was about to fire again then it seemed to graham that
the half of this mans neck had vanished a drop of
moisture fell on grahams cheek the green weapon
stopped half raised for a
with his face suddenly ex-
pressionless then he be-
gan to slant forward

his knees bent man and
darkness fell together at
the sound of his fall
graham rose up and ran
for his life until a step
down to the gangway
tripped him he scram-
bled to his feet turned up
the gangway and ran on

when the sixth star
glared he was al-
ready close to the yawn-
ing throat of a passage

he ran on the swifter for
the light entered the
passage and turned a
corner into absolute night
again he was knocked
sideways rolled over and
recovered his feet he
found himself one of a
crowd of invisible fugi-
tives pressing in one di-
rection his one thought
now was their thought
also to escape out of this
fighting he thrust and
struck staggered ran
was wedged tightly lost
ground and then was
clear again

  for some minutes he
was running through the

darkness along a winding passage and then he crossed
some wide and open space passed down a long incline
and came at last down a flight of steps to a level place
many people were shouting they are coming the
guards are coming they are firing get out of the fight-
ing the guards are firing it will be safe in seventh way
along here to seventh way there were women and
children in the crowd as well as men men called names
to him the crowd converged on an archway passed
through a short throat and emerged on a wider space
again lit dimly the black figures about him spread
out and ran up what seemed in the twilight to be a
gigantic series of steps he followed the people dis-
persed to the right and left  he perceived that
he was no longer in a crowd he stopped near the high-
est step before him on that level were groups of seats

and a little kiosk he went up to this and stopping in
the shadow of its eaves looked about him panting

  everything was vague and gray but he recognized
that these great steps were a series of platforms of the
ways now motionless again the platform slanted
up on either side and the tall buildings rose beyond vast
dim ghosts their inscriptions and advertisements indis-
tinctly seen and up through the girders and cables was a
faint interrupted ribbon of pallid sky a number of
people hurried by from their shouts and voices it
seemed they were hurrying to join the fighting other
less noisy figures flitted timidly among the shadows

  from very far away down the street he could hear the
sound of a struggle but it was evident to him that this
was not the street into which the theatre opened that
former fight it seemed had suddenly dropped out of
sound and hearing and-grotesque thought-they
were fighting for him

  for a space he was like a man who pauses in the
reading of a vivid book and suddenly doubts what he

had been taking unques-
tionably at that time
he had little mind for de-
tails the whole effect
was a huge astonishment
oddly enough while the
flight from the council
prison the great crowd in
the hall and the attack
of the red police upon
the swarming people
were clearly present in
his mind it cost him an
effort to piece in his
awakening and to revive
the meditative interval of
the silent rooms at
first his memory leapt
these things and took
him back to the cascade
at pentargen quivering in
the wind and all the
sombre splendors of the
sunlit cornish coast the
contrast touched every-
thing with unreality and
then the gap filled and
he began to comprehend
his position

  it was no longer abso-
lutely a riddle as it had
been in the silen rooms
at least he had the
strange bare outline now
he was in some way the
owner of half the world
and great political parties
were fighting to possess him on the one hand was the
white council with its red police set resolutely it
seemed on the usurpation of his property and perhaps
his murder on the other the revolution that had liber-
ated him with this unseen ostrog as its leader and
the whole of this gigantic city was convulsed by their
struggle frantic development of his world i do
not understand he cried i do not understand

  he had slipped out between the contending parties
into this liberty of the twilight what would happen
next what was happening he figured the red-clad
men as busily hunting him driving the black-badged
revolutionists before them

  at any rate chance had given him a breathing space
he could lurk unchallenged by the passers-by and watch
the course of things his eye followed up the intricate

small bunchcd-up figure
when the sleeper wakes



dim immensity of the twilight buildings and it came to
him as a thing infinitely wonderful that above there the
sun was rising and the world was lit and glowing with
the old familiar light of day in a little while he had
recovered his breath his clothing had already dried
upon him from the snow

  he wandered for miles along these twilight ways
speaking to no one accosted by no one-a dark figure
among dark figures-the coveted man out of the past
the inestimable unintentional owner of half the world
wherever there were lights or dense crowds or excep-
tional excitement he was afraid of recognition and
watched and turned back or went up and down by the
middle stairways into some transverse system of ways
at a lower or higher level and though he came on no
more fighting the whole city stirred with battle once
he had to run to avoid a marching multitude of men
that swept the street everyone abroad seemed involved
for the most part they were men and they carried what
he judged were weapons it seemed as though the
struggle was concentrated mainly in the quarter of the
city from which he came ever and again a distant
roaring the remote suggestion of that conflict reached
his ears then his caution and his curiosity struggled
together but his caution prevailed and he continued
wandering away from the fighting-so far as he could
judge he went unmolested unsuspected through the
dark after a time he ceased to hear even a remote
echo of the battle fewer and fewer people passed him
until at last the titanic streets became deserted the
frontages of the buildings grew plain and harsh he
seemed to have come to a district of vacant warehouses
solitude crept upon him-his pace slackened

  he became aware of a growing fatigue at times
he would turn aside and seat himself on one of the
numerous seats of the upper ways but a feverish
restlessness the knowledge of his vital implication in
this struggle would not let him rest in any place for
long was the struggle on his behalf alone

  and then in a desolate place came the shock of an
earthquake-a roaring and thundering-a mighty wind
of cold air pouring through the city the smash of glass
the slip and thud of falling masonry-a series of gigantic
concussions a mass of glass and ironwork fell from
the remote roofs into the middle gallery not a hundred
yards away from him and in the distance were shouts
and running he too was startled to an aimless activity
and ran first one way and then as aimlessly back

  a man came running towards him his self-control re-
turned what have they blown up asked the man
breathlessly that was an explosion and before gra-
ham could speak he had hurried on

  the great buildings rose dimly veiled by a perplexing
twilight albeit the rivulet of sky above was now bright
with day he noted many strange features understand-
ing none at the time he even spelt out many of the in-
scriptions in phonetic lettering but what profits it to
decipher a confusion of odd-looking letters resolving it-
self after painful strain of eye and mind into here is
eadhamite or labor bureau-little side gro-
tesque thought that in all probability some or all of these
cliff-like houses were his

  the perversity of his experience came to him vividly
in actual fact he had made such a leap in time as romanc-
ers have imagined again and again and that fact
realized he had been prepared his mind had as it were
seated itself for a spectacle and no spectacle but a
great vague danger unsympathetic shadows and veils of
darkness somewhere through the labyrinthine obscurity
his death sought him would he after all be killed be-
fore he saw it might be that even at the next shadowy
corner his destruction ambushed a great desire to see
a great longing to know arose in him

  he became fearful of corners it seemed to him that
there was safety in concealment where could he hide
to be inconspicuous when the lights returned at last
he sat down upon a seat in a recess on one of the higher
ways conceiving he was alone there

  he squeezed his knuckles into his weary eyes suppose
when he looked again he found the dark trough of parallel
ways and that intolerable altitude of edifice gone sup-
pose he were to discover the whole story of these last few
days the awakening the shouting multitudes the dark-
ness and the fighting a phantasmagoria a new and more
vivid sort of dream it must be a dream it was so in-
consecutive so reasonless why were the people fighting
for him why should this saner world regard him as
owner and master

  so he thought sitting blinded and then he looked
again half hoping in spite of his ears to see some famil-
iar aspect of the life of the nineteenth century to see
perhaps the little harbor of boscastle about him the
cliffs of pentargen or the bedroom of hi home but
fact takes no heed of human hopes a squad of men with
a black banner tramped athwart the nearer shadows in-
tent on conflict and beyond rose that giddy wall of front-
age vast and dark with the dim incomprehensible letter-
ing showing faintly on its face

  it is no dream he said no dream and he bowed
his face upon his hands

chapter xi
the old man who knew everything

e was startled by a cough close at hand

  he turned sharply and peering saw a smal
hunched-up figure sitting a couple of yards off in
the shadow of the enclosure

  have ye any news asked the high-pitched wheezy
voice of a very old man

  graham hesitated none he said

  i stay here till the lights come again said the old
man these blue scoundrels are everywhere-every-
where

  grahams answer was inarticulate assent he tried to
see the old man but the darkness hid his face he wanted
very much to respond to talk but he did not know how
to begin

  dark and damnable said the old man suddenly
dark and damnable turned out of my room among all
these dangers

thats hard ventured graham thats hard on you

  darkness an old man lost in the darkness and
all the world gone mad war and fighting the police
beaten and rogues abroad why dont they bring some
negroes to protect us  no more dark passages
for me i fell over a dead man

  youre safer with company said the old man if
its company of the right sort and peered frankly he
rose suddenly and came towards graham

  apparently the scrutiny was satisfactory the old
man sat down as if relieved to be no longer alone eh 
he said but this is a terrible time war and fighting
and the dead lying there-men strong men dying in the
dark sons i have three sons god knows where they
are tonight

  the voice ceased then repeated quavering god
knows where they are tonight

  graham stood revolving a question that should not
betray his ignorance again the old mans voice ended
the pause

  this ostrog will win he said he will win and
what the world will be like under him no one can tell
my sons are under the wind-vanes all three one of
my daughters-in-law was his mistress for a while his
mistress were not common people though theyve

sent me to wander tonight and take my chance   
i knew what was going on before most people but
this darkness and to fall over a dead body suddenly
i the dark i

  his wheezy breathing could be heard

  ostrog said graham

  the greatest boss the world has ever seen said the
voice

  graham ransacked his mind the council has few
friends among the people he hazarded

  few friends and poor ones at that theyve had
their time eh they should have kept to the clever
ones but twice they held election and ostrog-
and now it has burst out and nothing can stay it noth-
ing can stay it twice they rejected ostrog-ostrog
the boss  heard of his rages at the time-he was ter-
rible heaven save them for nothing on earth can
now he has raised the labor companies upon them
no one else would have dared all the blue canvas
armed and marching he will go through with it he
will go through

  he was silent for a little while this sleeper he
said and stopped

  yes said graham well

  the senile voice sank to a confidential whisper the
dim pale face came close the real sleeper-

  yes said graham

  died years ago

  what said graham sharply

  years ago died years ago

  you dont say so said graham

  i do i do say so he died this sleeper whos woke
up-they changed in the night a poor drugged insen-
sible creature but i musnt tell all i know i musnt
tell all i know

  for a little while he muttered inaudibly his secret was
too much for him i dont know the ones that put him
to sleep-that was before my time-but i know the man
who injected the stimulants and woke him again it was
ten to one-wake or kill wake or kill ostrogs way
graham was so astonished at these things that he
had to interrupt to make the old man repeat his words
to re-question vaguely before he was sure of the mean-
ing and folly of what he heard and his awakening had
not been natural was that an old mans senile supersti-
tion too or had it any truth in it feeling in the dark
corners of his memory he presently came on something
that might conceivably be an impression of some such
stimulating effect it dawned upon him that he had
happened upon a lucky encounter that at last he might
learn something of the new age the old man wheezed a
while and spat and then the piping reminiscent voice
resumed

  the first time they rejected him ive followed it all
rejected whom said graham the sleeper
sleeper no ostrog he was terrible-terrible
and he was promised then promised certainly the next
time fools they were-not to be more afraid of him
now all the citys his millstone and such as we dust
ground upon it dust ground upon it until he set to
work-the workers cut each others throats and mur-
dered a chinaman or a labor policeman at times and
left the rest of us in peace dead bodies robbing
darkness  such a thing hasnt been this gross of years
eh-but tis ill on small folks when the great fall out
its ill

  did you say-there had not been-what-for a gross
of years

  eh said the old man

  the old man said something about clipping his words
and made him repeat this a third time fighting and
slaying and weapons in hand and fools bawling freedom
and the like said the old man not in all my life has

there been that these are like the old days-for sure-
when the paris people broke out-three gross of years
ago thats what i mean hasnt been but its the
worlds way it had to come back i know i know
this five years ostrog has been working and there has
been trouble and trouble and hunger and threats and
high talk and arms blue canvas and murmurs no
one safe everything sliding and slipping and now
here we are revolt and fighting and the council come
to its end

  you are rather well-informed in these things said
graham

  i know what i hear it isnt all babble machine with
me

  no said graham wondering what babble machine
might be and you are certain this ostrog-you are
certain ostrog organized this rebellion and arranged for
the waking of the sleeper just to assert himself-
because he was not elected to the council

  everyone knows that i should think said the old
man except-just fools he meant to be master some-
how in the council or not everyone who knows any-
thing knows that and here we are with dead bodies
lying in the dark why where have you been if you
havent heard all about the trouble between ostrog and
the verneys and what do you think the troubles are
about the sleeper eh you think the sleepers real
and woke of his own accord-eh

  im a dull man older than i look and forgetful said
graham lots of things that have happened-especially
of late years- if i was the sleeper to tell you the
truth i couldnt know less about them

  eh said the voice old are you you dont sound
so very old but its not everyone keeps his memory to
my time of life-truly but these notorious things
but youre not so old as me-not nearly so old as me
well i ought not to judge other men by myself per-
haps im young-for so old a man maybe youre old
for so young

  thats it said graham and ive a queer history
i know very little and history practically i know no
history the sleeper and julius caesar are all the same
to me its interesting to hear you talk of these things

  i know a few things said the old man i know
a thing or two but- hark

the two men became silent listening there was
a heavy thud a concussion that made their seat
shiver the passers-by stopped shouted to one another
the old man was full of questions he shouted to a man
who passed near graham emboldened by his example
got up and accosted others none knew what had hap-
pened

  he returned to the seat and found the old man mutter-
ing vague interrogations in an undertone for a while
they said nothing to one another

  the sense of this gigantic struggle so near and yet
so remote oppressed grahams imagination was this
old man right was the report of the people right and
were the revolutionaries winning or were they all in
error and were the red guards driving all before them
at any time the flood of warfare might pour into this
silent quarter of the city and seize upon him again it
behooved him to learn all he could while there was time
he turned suddenly to the old man with a question and
left it unsaid but his motion moved the old man to
speech again

  eh but how things work together said the old man
this sleeper that all the fools put their trust in i ive
the whole history of it-i was always a good one for
histories when i was a boy-im that old-i used to
read printed books youd hardly think it likely youve
seen none-they rot and dust so-and the sanitary com-
when the sleeper wakes



pany burns them to make ashlarite but they were con-
venient in their dirty way one learnt a lot these new-
fangled babble machines-they dont seem new-fangled
to you eh-theyre easy to hear easy to forget but
ive traced all the sleeper business from the first

  you will scarcely believe it said graham slowly
im so ignorant-ive been so preoccupied in my own
little affairs my circumstances have been so odd-i know
nothing of this sleepers history who was he

  eh said the old man i know i know he was
a poor nobody and set on a playful woman poor soul
and he fell into a trance theres the old things they
had those brown things-silver photographs-still show-
ing him as he lay a gross and a half years ago-a gross
and a half of years

  set on a playful woman poor soul said graham
softly to himself and then aloud yes-well go on
you must know he had a cousin named warming a
solitary man without children who made a big fortune
speculating in roads-the first eadhamite roads but
surely youve heard no why he bought all the
patent rights and made a big company in those days
there were grosses of grosses of separate businesses
and business companies grosses of grosses his roads
killed the railroads-the old things-in two dozen years
he bought up and eadhamited the tracks and because he
didnt want to break up his great property or let in share-
holders he left it all to the sleeper and put it under a
board of trustees that he had picked and trained he
knew then the sleeper wouldnt wake that he would go on
sleeping sleeping till he died he knew that quite well
and plump a man in the united states who had lost
two sons in a boat accident followed that up with an-
other great bequest his trustees found themselves with
a dozen myriads of lions-worth or more of property at
the very beginning

  what was his name

  graham

  no- mean-that americans

   isbister

  isbister cried graham why i dont even know
the name

  of course not said the old man of course not
people dont learn much in the school nowadays but
i know all about him he was a rich american who
went from england and he left the sleeper even more
than warming how he made it that i dont know
something about pictures by machinery but he made
it and left it and so the council had its start it was
just a council of trustees at first

  and how did it grow

  eh-but youre not up to things money attracts
money-and twelve brains are better than one they
played it cleverly they worked politics with money and
kept on adding to the money by working currency and
tariffs they grew-they grew and for years the
twelve trustees hid the growing of the sleepers estate
under double names and company titles and all that the
council spread by title deed mortgage share every
political party evry newspaper they bought if you
listen to the old stories you will see the council growing
and growing billions and billions of lions at last-the
sleepers estate and all growing out of a whim-out of
this warmings will and an accident to isbisters sons

  men are strange said the old man the strange
thing to me is how the council worked together so long
as many as twelve but they worked in cliques from the
first and theyve slipped back in my young days speak-
of the council was like an ignorant man speaking of god
we didnt think they could do wrong we didnt know
of their women and all that or else ive got wiser

  men are strange said the old man here are you
young and ignorant and me-sevendy years old and i

might reasonably be forgetting-explaining it all to
you short and clear

  sevendy he said sevendy and i hear and see-
hear better than i see and reason clearly and keep my-
self up to all the happenings of things sevendy

  life is strange i was twaindy before ostrog was a
baby i remember him long before hed pushed his way
to the head of the wind vanes control ive seen many
changes eh ive worn the blue and at last ive
come to see this crush and darkness and tumult and dead
men carried by in heaps on the ways and all his doing
all his doing

   his voice died away in scarcely articulate praises of
ostrog

   graham thought let me see he said if i have it
right

  he extended a hand and ticked off points upon his
fingers the sleeper has been asleep-

   changed said the old man

  perhaps and meanwhile the sleepers property grew
in the hands of twelve trustees until it swallowed up
nearly all the great ownership of the world the twelve
trustees-by virtue of this property have become vir-
tually masters of the world because they are the pay-
ing power-just as the old english parliament used to
be-

  eh said the old man thats so-thats a good
comparison youre not so-

  and now this ostrog-has suddenly revolutionized
the world by waking the sleeper-who no one but the
superstitious common people had ever dreamt would
wake again-raising the sleeper to claim his property
from the council after all these years

  the old man endorsed this statement with a cough
its strange he said to meet a man who learns these
things for the first time tonight

   aye said graham its strange

   have you been in a pleasure city said the old man
all my life ive longed- he laughed even now
he said i could enjoy a little fun enjoy seeing things
anyhow he mumbled a sentence graham did not un-
derstand

fftvhe sleeper-when did he awake said graham
  jl suddenly

  three days ago

  where is he

  ostrog has him he escaped from the council not
four hours ago my dear sir where were you at the
time he was in the hall of the markets-where the
fighting has been all the city was screaming about it
all the babble machines everywhere it was shouted
even the fools who speak for the council were admitting
it everyone was rushing off to see him-everyone was
getting arms were you drunk or asleep and even
then but youre joking surely youre pretending
it was to stop the shouting of the babble machines and
prevent the people gathering that they turned off the
electricity-and put this damned darkness upon us do
you mean to say-

  i had heard the sleeper was rescued said graham
but-to come back a minute are you sure ostro has
him

   he wont let him go said the old man

  and the sleeper are you sure he is not genuine

i have never heard-

  so all the fools think so they think as if there
wasnt a thousand things that were never heard i know
ostrog too well for that did i tell you in a way im
a sort of relation of ostrogs a sort of relation through
my daughter-in-law

  i suppose-

  well


amazing stories quarterly

  i suppose theres no chance of this sleeper asserting
himself i suppose hes certain to be a puppet-in
ostrogs hands or the councils as soon as the struggle
is over

  in ostrogs hands-certainly why shouldnt he be a
puppet look at his position everything done for him
every pleasure possible why should he want to assert
himself

  what are these pleasure cities said graham
abruptly

  the old man made him repeat the question when at
last he was assured of grahams words he nudged him
violently thats too much said he youre poking
fun at an old man ive been suspecting you know more
than you pretend

  perhaps i do said graham but no why should
i go on acting no i do not know what a pleasure city
is

  the old man laughed in an intimate way

  what is more i do not know how to read your letters
i do not know what money you use i do not know what
foreign countries there are i do not know where i am
i cannot count i do not know where to get food nor
drink nor shelter

  come come said the old man if you had a glass
of drink now would you put it in your ear or your eye
i want you to tell me all these things

  he he well gentlemen who dress in silk must have
their fun a withered hand caressed grahams arm for
a moment silk well well but all the same i wish
i was the man who was put up as the sleeper hell have
a fine time of it all the pomp and pleasure hes a
queer looking face when they used to let anyone go to
see him ive got tickets and been the image of the
real one as the photographs show him this substitute
used to be yellow but hell get fed up its a queer
world think of the luck of it the luck of it i expect
hell be sent to capri its the best fun for a greener
his cough overtook him again then he began mumb-
ling enviously of pleasures and strange delights the
luck of it the luck of it all my life ive been in london
hoping to get my chance

  but you dont know that the sleeper died said gra-
ham suddenly

  the old man made him repeat his words

  men dont live beyond ten dozen its not in the
order of things said the old man im not a fool
fools may believe it but not me

  graham became angry with the old mans assurance
whether you are a fool or not he said it happens
you are wrong about the sleeper

  -eh

  you are wrong about the sleeper i havent told you
before but i will tell you now you are wrong about
the sleeper

  how do you know i thought you didnt know any-
thing-not even about pleasure cities

  graham paused

  you dont know said the old man how are you to
know its very few men-

  i am the sleeper

  he had to repeat it

  there was a brief pause theres a silly thing to say
sir if youll excuse me it might get you into trouble
in a time like this said the old man

  graham slightly dashed repeated his assertion

  i was saying i was the sleeper that years and years
ago i did indeed fall asleep in a little stone-built vil-
lage in the days when there were hedgerows and vil-
lages and inns and all the countryside cut up into little
pieces little fields have you never heard of those days
and it is i-i who speak to you-who awakened again
these four days since

  four days since-the sleeper but theyve got the

sleeper they have him and they wont let him go
nonsense youve been talking sensibly enough up to
now i can see it as though i was there there will be
lincoln like a keeper just behind him they wont let
him go about alone trust them youre a queer fellow
one of these fun pokers i see now why you have been
clipping your words so oddly buc-

  he stopped abruptly and graham could see his gesture

  as if ostrog would let the sleeper run about alone
no youre telling that to the wrong man altogether
eh as if i should believe whats your game and
besides weve been talking of the sleeper

  graham stood up listen he said i am the
sleeper

  youre an odd man said the old man to sit here
in the dark talking clipped and telling a lie of that sort
but-

  grahams exasperation fell to laughter it is pre-
posterous he cried preposterous the dream must
end it gets wilder and wilder here am i-in this
damned twilight-i never knew a dream in twilight be-
fore-an anachronism by two hundred years and trying
to persuade an old fool that i am myself and meanwhile

-	uhg

  he moved in gusty irritation and went striding in a
moment the old man was pursuing him eh but dont
go cried the old man im an old fool i know dont
go dont leave me in all this darkness

  graham hesitated stopped suddenly the folly of tell-
ing his secret flashed into his mind

  i didnt mean to offend you-disbelieving you said
the old man coming near its no manner of harm
call yourself the sleeper if it pleases you tis a foolish
trick-

  graham hesitated turned abruptly and went on his
way

  for a time he heard the old mans hobbling pursuit
and his wheezy cries receding but at last the darkness
swallowed him and graham saw him no more

chapter xii
ostrog

graham could now take a clearer view of his posi-
tion for a long time yet he wandered but after
the talk of the old man his discovery of this ostrog
was clear in his mind as the final inevitable decision
one thing was evident those who were at the head-
quarters of the revolt had succeeded very admirably in
suppressing the fact of his disappearance but every
moment he expected to hear the report of his death or of
his recapture by the council

  presently a man stopped before him have you
heard he said

  no i said graham starting

  near a dozand said the man a dozand men and
hurried on

  a number of men and a girl passed in the darkness
gesticulating and shouting capitulated given up
a dozand of men two dozand of men ostrog
hurrah ostrog hurrah these cries receded became
indistinct

  other shouting men followed for a time his atten-
tion was absorbed in the fragments of speech he heard
he had a doubt whether all were speaking english
scraps floated to him scraps like pigeon english like
nigger dialect blurred and mangled distortions he
dared accost no one with questions the impression the
people gave him jarred altogether with his preconceptions
of the struggle and confirmed the old mans faith in
ostrog it was only slowly he could bring himself to
believe that all these people were rejoicing at the defeat
of the council that the council which had pursued him
with such power and vigor was after all the weaker cf
when the sleeper wakes



the two sides in conflict and if that was so how did
it affect him several times he hesitated on the verge
of fundamental questions once he turned and walked
for a long way after a little man of rotund inviting out-
line but he was unable to master confidence to address
him

  it was only slowly that it came to him that he might
sk for the wind-vane offices whatever the wind-vane
offices might be his first inquiry simply resulted in

o	direction to go on towards westminster his second
led to the discovery of a short cut in which he was
speedily lost he was told to leave the ways to which
lie had hitherto confined himself-no other means of
transit-and to plunge down one of the middle stair-
cases into the blackness of a crossway thereupon came
some trivial adventures chief of these an ambiguous
encounter with a gruff-voiced invisible creature speaking
in a strange dialect that seemed at first a strange tongue
a thick flow of speech with the drifting corpses of eng-
lish words therein the dialect of the latter-day vile
then another voice drew near a girls voice singing
tralala tralala she spoke to graham her english
touched with something of the same quality she pro-
fessed to have lost her sister she blundered needlessly
into him he thought caught hold of him and laughed
but a word of vague remonstrance sent her into the
unseen again

  the sounds about him increased stumbling people
passed him speaking excitedly they have surren-
dered the council surely not the council they
are saying so in the ways the passage seemed wider
suddenly the wall fell away he was in a great space
and people were stirring remotely he inquired his
way of an indistinct figure strike straight across
said a womans voice he left his guiding wall and in
a moment had stumbled against a little table on which
were utensils of glass grahams eyes now attuned
to darkness made out a long vista with pallid tables
on either side he went down this at one or two of
the tables he heard a clang of glass and a sound of eat-
ing there were people then cool enough to dine or
daring enough to steal a meal in spite of social con-
vulsion and darkness far off and high up he presently
saw a pallid light of a semi-circular shape as he ap-
proached this a black edge came up and hid it he
stumbled at steps and found himself in a gallery he
heard a sobbing and found two scared little girls
crouched by a railing these children became silent at
the near sound of feet he tried to console them but
they were very still until he left them then as he
receded he could hear them sobbing again

  presently he found himself at the foot of a staircase
and near a wide opening he saw a dim twilight above
this and ascended out of the blackness into a street of
moving ways again along this a disorderly swarm of
people marched shouting they were singing snatches
of the song of the revolt most of them out of tune
here and there torches flared creating brief hysterical
shadows he asked his way and was twice puzzled by
that same thick dialect his third attempt won an
answer he could understand he was two miles from
the wind-vane offices in westminster but the way was
easy to follow

  when at last he did approach the district of the wind-
vane offices it seemed to him from the cheering pro-
cessions that came marching along the ways from the
tumult of rejoicing and finally from the restoration
of the lighting of the city that the overthrow of the
council must already be accomplished and still no
news of his absence came to his ears

  the re-illumination of the city came with startling
abruptness suddenly he stood blinking all about him
men halted dazzled and the world was incandescent
the light found him already upon the outskirts of the

excited crowds that choked the ways near the wind-
vane offices and the sense of visibility and exposure
that came with it turned his colorless intention of join-
ing ostrog to a keen anxiety

  for a time he was jostled obstructed and endan-
gered by men hoarse and weary with cheering his name
some of them bandaged and bloody in his cause the
frontage of the wind-vane offices was illuminated by
some moving picture but what it was he could not see
because in spite of his strenuous attempts the density
of the crowd prevented his approaching it from the
fragments of speech he caught he judged it conveyed
news of the fighting about the council house ignor-
ance and indecision made him slow and ineffective in
his movements for a time he could not conceive how
he was to get within the unbroken facade of this place
he made his way slowly into the midst of this mass of
people until he realized that the descending staircase
of the central way led to the interior of the building
this gave him a goal but the crowding in the central
path was so dense that it was long before he could reach
it and even then he encountered intricate obstruction
and had an hour of vivid argument first in this guard
room and then in that before he could get a note taken
to the one man of all men who was most eager to see
him his story was laughed to scorn at one place and
wiser for that when at last he reached a second stair-
way he professed simply to have news of extraordinary
importance for ostrog what it was he would not say
they sent his note reluctantly for a long time he
waited in a little room at the foot of the lift shaft and
thither at last came lincoln eager apologetic aston-
ished he stopped in the doorway scrutinizing graham
then rushed forward effusively

  yes he cried it is you and you are not dead

  graham made a brief explanation

ivty brother is waiting explained lincoln he

  iv is alone in the wind-vane offices we feared you
had been killed in the theatre he doubted-and things
are very urgent still in spite of what we are telling
them there-or he would have come to you

  they ascended a lift passed along a narrow passage
crossed a great hall empty save for two hurrying mes-
sengers and entered a comparatively little room whose
only furniture was a long settee and a large oval disc
of cloudy shifting grey hung by cables from the wall
there lincoln left graham for a space and he remained
alone without understanding the shifting smoky shapes
that drove slowly across this disc

  his attention was arrested by a sound that began
abruptly it was cheering the frantic cheering of a
vast but very remote crowd a roaring exultation this
ended as sharply as it had begun like a sound heard
between the opening and shutting of a door in the
outer room was a noise of hurrying steps and a melodious
clinking as if a loose chain was running over the teeth
of a wheel

  then he heard the voice of a woman the rustle of
unseen garments it is ostrog he heard her say a
little bell rang fitfully and then everything was still
again

  presently came voices footsteps and movement with-
out the footsteps of some one person detached itself
from the other sounds and drew near firm evenly
measured steps the curtain lifted slowly a tall
white-haired man clad in garments of cream-colored
silk appeared regarding graham from under his raised
arm

  for a moment the white form remained holding thg
curtain then dropped it and stood before it grahams
first impression was of a very broad forehead very
pale blue eyes deep sunken under white brows an
aquiline nose and a heavily-lined resolute mouth the

folds of flesh over the eyes the drooping of the corners
of the mouth contradicted the upright bearing and said
the man was old graham rose to his feet instinctively
and for a moment the two men stood in silence regard-
ing each other

  you are ostrog said graham

  i am ostrog

  the boss

  so i am called

  graham felt the inconvenience of the silence i
have to thank you chiefly i understand for my safety
he said presently

we were afraid you were killed said ostrog or
sent to sleep again-for ever we have been doing every-
thing to keep our secret-the secret of your disappear-
ance where have you been how did you get here
graham told him briefly

  ostrog listened in silence

  he smiled faintly do you know what i was doing
when they came to tell me you had come

  how can i guess

  preparing your double

  my double

  a man as like you as we could find we were going
to hypnotize him to save him the difficulty of acting
it was imperative the whole of this revolt depends
on the idea that you are awake alive and with us even
now a great multitude of people has gathered in the
theatre clamoring to see you they do not trust   
you know of course-something of your position
very little said graham

  it is like this ostrog walked a pace or two into
the room and turned you are absolute owner he
said of more than half the world as a result of that
you are practically king your powers are limited in
many intricate ways but you are the figure-head the
popular symbol of government this white council the
council of trustees as it is called-

  i have heard the vague outline of these things

  i wondered

  i came upon a garrulous old man

  i see    our masses-the word comes from
your days-you know of course that we still have
masses-regard you as our actual ruler just as a great
number of people in your days regarded the crown as
the ruler they are discontented-the masses all over
the earth-with the rule of your trustees for the
most part it is the old discontent the old quarrel of the
common man with his commonness-the misery of work
and discipline and unfitness but your trustees have
ruled ill in certain matters in the administration of
the labor companies for example they have been un-
wise they have given endless opportunities already
we of the popular party were agitating for reforms-
when your waking came came if it had been con-
trived it could not have come more opportunely he
smiled the public mind making no allowance for
your years of quiescence had already hit on the thought
of waking you and appealing to you and-flash

  he indicated the outbreak by a gesture and graham
moved his head to show that he understood

  the council muddled-quarrelled they always do
they could not decide what to do with you you know
how they imprisoned you

  i see i see and now-we win

  we win indeed we win tonight in five swift
hours suddenly we struck everywhere the wind-
vane people the labor company and its millions burst
the bonds we got the pull of the aeropiles

  he paused yes said graham guessing that aero-
pile meant flying machine

  that was of course essential or they could have
got away all the city rose every third man almost
was in it all the blue all the public services save only

just a few aeronauts and about half the red police you
were rescued and their own police of the ways-not
half of them could be massed at the council house-
have been broken up disarmed or killed all london
is ours-now only the council house remains

  half of those who remain to them of the red police
wero lost in that foolish attempt to recapture you they
lost their heads when they lost you they flung all they
had at the theatre we cut them off from the council
house there truly tonight has been a night of vic-
tory everywhere your star has blazed a day ago-
the white council ruled as it has ruled for a gross of
years for a century and a half of years and then with
only a little whispering a covert arming here and there
suddenly-so i

  i am very ignorant said graham i suppose- i
do not clearly understand the conditions of this fight-
ing if you could explain where is the council
where is the fight

  ostrog stepped across the room something clicked
and suddenly save for an oval glow they were in dark-
ness for a moment graham was puzzled

  then he saw that the cloudy grey disc had taken
depth and color had assumed the appearance of an oval
window looking out upon a strange unfamiliar scene

  at the first glance he was unable to guess what this
scene might be it was a daylight scene the daylight
of a wintry day grey and clear across the picture and
halfway as it seemed between him and remoter view a
stout cable of twisted white wire stretched vertically
then he perceived that the rows of great wind-wheels
he saw the wide intervals the occasional gulfs of dark-
ness were akin to those through which he had fled
from the council house he distinguished an orderly
file of red figures marching across an open space be-
tween files of men in black and realized before ostrog
spoke that he was looking down on the upper surface of
latter-day london the overnight snows had gone he
judged that this mirror was some modern replacement
of the camera obscura but that matter was not ex-
plained to him he saw that though the file of red
figures was trotting from left to right yet they were
passing out of the picture to the left he wondered
momentarily and then saw that the picture was pass-
ing slowly panorama fashion across the oval

  in a moment you will see the fighting said ostrog
at his elbow those fellows in red you notice are pris-
oners this is the roof space of london-all the houses
are practically continuous now the streets and public
squares are covered in the gaps and chasms of youf
time have disappeared

something out of focus obliterated half the picture
its form suggested a man there was a gleam of
metal a flash something that swept across the oval as
the eyelid of a bird sweeps across its eye and the pic-
ture was clear again and now graham beheld men
running down among the wind-wheels pointing weapons
from which jetted out little smoky flashes they
swarmed thicker and thicker to the right gesticulating
-it might be they were shouting but of that the pic-
ture told nothing they and the wind-wheels passed
slowly and steadily across the field of the mirror

  now said ostrog comes the council house and
slowly a black edge crept into view and gathered gra-
hams attention soon it was no longer an edge hut a
cavity a huge blackened space amidst the clustering
edifices and from it thin spires of smoke rose into the
pallid winter sky gaunt ruinous masses of the build-
ing mighty truncated piers and girders rose dismally
out of this cavernous darkness and over these vestige
of some splendid place countless minute men were
clambering leaping swarming

  this is the council house said ostrog their
when the sleeper wakes



last stronghold and the fools wasted enough ammu-
nition to hold out for a month in blowing up the build-
ings all about them-to stop our attack you heard the
smash it shattered half the brittle glass in the city

  and while he spoke graham saw that beyond this
area of ruins overhanging it and rising to a great
height was a ragged mass of white building this mass
had been isolated by the ruthless destruction of its sur-
roundings black gaps marked the passages the disaster
had torn apart big halls had been slashed open and the
decoration of their interiors showed dismally in the
wintry dawn and down the jagged walls hung festoons
of divided cables and twisted ends of lines and metallic
rods and amidst ill the vast details moved little red
specks the red-clothed defenders of the council every
now and then faint flashes illuminated the bleak shadows
at the first sight it seemed to graham that an attack
upon this isolated white building was in progress but
then he perceived that the party of the revolt was not
advancing but sheltered amidst the colossal wreckage
that encircled this last ragged stronghold of the red-
garbed men was keeping up a fitful firing

  and not ten hours ago he had stood beneath the venti-
lating fans in a little chamber within that remote build-
ing wondering what was happening in the world

  looking more attentively as this warlike episode
moved silently across the centre of the mirror graham
saw that the white building was surrounded on every
side by ruins and ostrog proceeded to describe in con-
cise phrases how its defenders had sought by such de-
struction to isolate themselves from a storm he spoke
of the loss of men that huge downfall had entailed in
an indifferent tone he indicated an improvised mor-
tuary among the wreckage showed ambulances swarm-
ing like cheese-mites along a ruinous groove that had
once been a street of moving ways he was more inter-
ested in pointing out the parts of the council house
the distribution of the besiegers in a little while the
civil contest that had convulsed london was no longer
a mystery to graham it was no-tumultuous revolt had
occurred that night no equal warfare but a splendidly
organized coup dstat ostrogs grasp of details was
astonishing he seemed to know the business of even
the smallest knot of black and red specks that crawled
amidst these places

  he stretched a huge black arm across the luminous
picture and showed the room whence graham had
escaped and across the chasm of ruins the course of
his flight graham recognized the gulf across which
the gutter ran and the wind-wheels where he had
crouched from the flying machine the rest of his path
had succumbed to the explosion he looked again at the
council house and it was already half hidden and on
the right a hillside with a cluster of domes and pin-
nacles hazy dim and distant was gliding into view
and the council is really overthrown he said
overthrown said ostrog

  and i- is it indeed true that i-

  you are master of the world

  but that white flag-

  that is the flag of the council-the flag of the rule
of the world it will fall the fight is over their at-
tack on the theatre was their last frantic struggle
they have only a thousand men or so and some of these
men will be disloyal they have little ammunition and
we are reviving the ancient arts we are casting guns
but-help is this city the world

  practically this is all they have left to them of their
empire abroad the cities have either revolted with us
or wait the issue your awakening has perplexed them
paralyzed them

  but havent the council flying machines why is
there no fighting with them

  they had but the greater part of the aeronauts
were in the revolt with us they wouldnt take the
risk of fighting on our side but they would not stir
against us we had to get a pull with the aeronauts
quite half were with us and the others knew it directly
they knew you had got away those looking for you
dropped we killed the man who shot at you-an hour
ago and we occupied the flying stages at the outset
in every city we could and so stopped and captured the
aeroplanes and as for the little flying machines that
turned out-for some did-we kept up too straight and
steady a fire for them to get near the council house
if they dropped they couldnt rise again because theres
no clear space about there for them to get up several
we have smashed several others have dropped and sur-
rendered the rest have gone off to the continent to lind
a friendly city if they can before their fuel runs out
most of these men were only too glad to be taken pris-
oner and kept out of harms way upsetting in a flying
machine isnt a very attractive prospect theres no
chance for the council that way its days are done

  he laughed and turned to the oval reflection again
to show graham what he meant by flying stages even
the four nearer ones were remote and obscured by a
thin morning haze but graham could perceive they
were very vast structures judged even by the standard
of the things about them

  and then as these dim shapes passed to the left there
came again the sight of the expanse across which the
disarmed men in red had been marching and then
the black ruins and then again the beleaguered white
fastness of the council it appeared no longer a ghostly
pile but glowing amber in the sunlight for a cloud
shadow had passed about it the pigmy struggle still
hung in suspense but now the red defenders were no
longer firing

so in a dusky stillness the man from the nineteenth
century saw the closing scene of the great revolt
the forcible establishment of his rule with a quality
of startling discovery it came to him that this was his
world and not that other he had left behind that this
was no spectacle to culminate and ceasc that in this
world lay whatever life was still before him lay all his
duties and dangers and responsibilities he turned
with fresh questions ostrog began to answer them
and then broke off abruptly but these things i must
explain more fully later at present there are-duties
the people are coming by the moving ways towards this
ward from every part of the city-the markets and
theatres are densely crowded you are just in time for
them they are clamoring to see you and abroad they
want to see you paris new york chicago denver
capri-thousands of cities are up and in a tumult un-
decided and clamoring to see you they have clamored
that you should be awakened for years and now it is
done they will scarcely believe-

  but surely-i cant go  

  ostrog answered from the other side of the room
and the picture on the oval disc paled and vanished
as the light jerked back again there are kinetotele-
photographs he said as you bow to the people here
-all over the world myriads of myriads of people
packed and still in darkened halls will see you also in
black and white of course-not like this and you will
hear their shouts reinforcing the shouting in the hall

  and there is an optical contrivance we shall use
said ostrog used by some of the posturers and women
dancers it may be novel to you you stand in a very
bright light and they see not you but a magnified image
of you thrown on a screen-so that even the furtherest
man in the remotest gallery can if he chooses count your
eyelashes


amazing stories quarterly

  graham clutched desperately at one of the questions
in his mind what is the population of london he
said

  eight and twaindy myriads

  eight and what

  more than thirty-three millions

  these figures went beyond grahams imagination

  you will be expected to say something said ostrog
not what you used to call a speech but what our
people call a word-just one sentence six or seven
words something formal if i might suggest-i have
awakened and my heart is with you that is the sort
of thing they want

  what was that asked graham

   i am awakened and my heart is with you and
bow-bow royally but first we must get you black
robes-for black is your color do you mind and
then they will disperse to their homes

  graham hesitated i am in your hands he said

  ostrog was clearly of that opinion he thought for
a moment turned to the curtain and called brief direc-
tions to some unseen attendants almost immediately
a black robe the very fellow of the black robe graham
had worn in the theatre was brought and as he threw
it about his shoulders there came from the room without
the shrilling of a high-pitched bell ostrog turned in
interrogation to the attendant then suddenly seemed
to change his mind pulled the curtain aside and dis-
appeared

  for a moment graham stood with the deferential at-
tendant listening to ostrogs retreating steps there
was a sound of quick question and answer and of men
running the curtain was snatched back and ostrog
reappeared his massive face glowing with excitement
he crossed the room in a stride clicked the room into
darkness gripped grahams arm and pointed to the
mirror

  even as we turned away he said

  graham saw his index finger black and colossal above
the mirrored council house for a moment he did not
understand and then he perceived that the flagstaff
that had carried the white banner was bare

  do you mean- he began

  the council has surrendered its rule is at an end
for everyone

  look and ostrog pointed to a coil of black that
crept in little jerks up the vacant flagstaff unfolding-as
it rose

  the oval picture paled as lincoln pulled the curtain
aside and entered

  they are clamorous he said

  ostrog kept his grip of grahams arm

  we have raised the people he said we have given
them arms for today at least their wishes must be
law

  lincoln held the curtain open for graham and ostrog
to pass through   

  on his way to the markets graham had a transitory
glance of a long narrow white-walled room in which
men in the universal blue canvas were carrying cov-
ered things like biers and about which men in medical
purple hurried to and fro from this room came groans
and wailing he had an impression of an empty blood-
stained couch of men on other couches bandaged and
blood-stained it was just a glimpse from a railed foot-
way and then a buttress hid the place and they were
going on towards the markets   

  the roar of the multitude was near now it leapt to
thunder and arresting his attention a fluttering of
black banners the waving of blue canvas and brown
rags and the swarming vastness of the theatre near
the public markets came into view down a long passage
the picture opened out he perceived they were enter-

ing the great theatre of his first appearance the great
theatre he had last seen as a chequer-work of glare and
blackness in his flight from the red police this time he
entered it along a gallery at a level high above the stage
the place was now brilliantly lit again he sought the
gangway up which he had fled but he could not tell it
from among its dozens of fellows nor could he see any-
thing of the smashed seats deflated- cushions and such
like traces of the fight because of the density of the
people except the stage the whole place was closely
packed looking down the effect was a vast area of
stippled pink each dot a still upturned face regarding
him at his appearance with ostrog the cheering died
away the singing died away a common interest stilled
and unified the disorder it seemed as though every in-
dividual of those myriads was watching him

chapter xiii

the end of the old order

so far as graham was able to judge it was near mid-
day when the white banner of the council fell but
some hours had to elapse before it was possible to
effect the formal capitulation and so after he had
spoken his word he retired to his new apartments
in the wind-vane offices the continuous excitement of
the last twelve hours had left him inordinately fatigued
even his curiosity was exhausted for a space he sat
inert and passive with open eyes and for a space he
slept he was roused by two medical attendants come
prepared with stimulants to sustain him through the
next occasion after he had taken their drugs and
bathed by their advice in cold water he felt a rapid re-
turn of interest and energy and was presently able and
willing to accompany ostrog through several miles as
it seemed of passages lifts and slides to the closing
scene of the white councils rule

  the way ran deviously through a maze of buildings
they came at last to a passage that curved about and
showed broadening before him an oblong opening clouds
hot with sunset and the ragged skyline of the ruinous
council house a tumult of shouts came drifting up
to him in another moment they had come out high
up on the brow of the cliff of torn buildings that over-
hung the wreckage the vast area opened to grahams
eyes none the less strange and wonderful for the remote
view he had had of it in the oval mirror

  this rudely amphitheatral space seemed now the bet-
ter part of a mile to its outer edge it was gold lit ob
the left hand catching the sunlight and below and tc
the right clear and cold in the shadow above the
shadowy grey council house that stood in the midst of
it the great black banner of the surrender still hung
in sluggish folds against the blazing sunset severed
rooms halls and passages gaped strangely broken masses
of metal projected dismally from the complex wreckage
vast masses of twisted cable dropped like tangled sea-
weed and from its base came a tumult of innumerable
voices violent concussions and the sound of trumpets
all about this great white pile was a ring of desolation
the smashed and blackened masses the gaunt founda-
tions and ruinous lumber of the fabric that had been
destroyed by the councils orders skeletons of girders
titanic masses of wall forests of stout pillars amongst
the sombre wreckage beneath running water flashed and
glistened and far away across the space out of the midst
of a vague vast mass of buildings there thrust the
twisted end of a water-main two hundred feet in the
air thunderously spouting a shining cascade and
everywhere great multitudes of people

  wherever there was space and foothold people
swarmed little people small and minutely clear except
where the sunset touched them to indistinguishable gold
when the sleeper wakes

vast masses of twisted cable dropped liko tangled soa-wced

they clambered up the tottering walla they clung in
wreaths and groups about the high-standing pillars
they swarmed along the edges of the circle of ruins
the air was full of their shouting and they were press-
ing and swaying towards the central space

  the upper stories of the council house seemed de-
serted not a human being was visible only the droop-
ing banner of the surrender hung heavily against the
light the dead were within the council house or
hidden by the swarming people or carried away gra-
ham could see only a few neglected bodies in gaps and
corners of the ruins and amidst the flowing water

  will you let them see you sire said ostrog they
are very anxious to see you

  graham hesitated and then walked forward to where
the broken verge of wall dropped sheer he stood look-
ing down a lonely tall black figure against the sky

  very slowly the swarming ruins became aware of him
and as they did so little bands of black-uniformed men
appeared remotely thrusting through the crowds to-

wards the council house he saw little black heads
become pink looking at him saw by that means a wave
of recognition sweep across the space it occurred to
him that he should accord them some recognition he
held up his arm then pointed to the council house and
dropped his hand the voices below became unanimous
gathered volume came up to him as multitudinous wave-
lets of cheering

  the western sky was a pallid bluish green and jupiter
shone high in the south before the capitulation was ac-
complished above was a slow insensible change the
advance of night serene and beautiful below was hurry
excitement conflicting orders pauses spasmodic de-
velopments of organization a vast ascending clamor and
confusion before the council came out toiling per-
spiring men directed by a conflict of shouts carried
forth hundreds of those who had perished in the hand-
to-hand conflict within those long passages and
chambers   

  guards in black lined the way that the council would

come and as far as the eye could reach into the hazy
blue twilight of the ruins and swarming now at every
possible point in the captured council house and along
the shattered cliff of its circumadjacent buildings were
innumerable people and their voices even when they
were not cheering were as the soughing of the sea upon
a pebble beach ostrog had chosen a huge commanding
pile of crushed and overthrown masonry and on this
a stage of timbers and metal girders was being hastily
constructed its essential parts were complete but hum-
ming and clangorous machinery still glared fitfully in the
shadows beneath this temporary edifice

  the stage had a small higher portion on which gra-
ham stood with ostrog and lincoln close beside him
a little in advance of a group of minor officers a broader
lower stage surrounded this quarter deck and on this
were the black-uniformed guards of the revolt armed
with the little green weapons whose very names graham
still did not know those standing about him perceived
that his eyes wandered perpetually from the swarming
people in the twilight ruins about him to the darkling
mass of the white council house whence the trustees
would presently come and to the gaunt cliffs of ruin
that encircled him and so back to the people the voices
of the crowd swelled to a deafening tumult

   he saw the councillors first afar off in the glare of one
of the temporary lights that marked their path a little
group of white figures blinking in a black archway in
the council house they had been in darkness he
watched them approaching drawing nearer past first
this blazing electric star and then that the minatory
roar of the crowd over whom their power had lasted for
a hundred and fifty years marched along beside them
as they drew still nearer their faces came out weary
white and anxious he saw them blinking up through
the glare about him and ostrog he contrasted their
strange cold looks in the hall of atlas    pres-
ently he could recognize several of them the man who
had rapped the table at howard a burly man with a red
beard and one delicate-featured short dark man with
a peculiarly long skull he noted that two were whis-
pering together and looking behind him at ostrog next
there came a tall dark and handsome man walking down-
cast abruptly he glanced up his eyes touched graham
for a moment and passed beyond him to ostrog the
way that had been made for them was so contrived that
they had to march past and curve about before they came
to the sloping path of planks that ascended to the stage
where their surrender was to be made

  the master the master god and the master
shouted the people to hell with the council gra-
ham looked at their multitudes receding beyond count-
ing into a shouting haze and then at ostrog beside him
white and steadfast and still his eye went again to
the little group of white councillors and then he
looked up at the familiar quiet stars overhead the
marvelous element in his fate was suddenly vivid could
that be his indeed that little life in his memory two
hundred years gone by-and this as well

chapter xiv
from the crows nest

and so after strange delays and through an avenue
of doubt and battle this man from the nineteenth
century came at last to his position at the head
of that complex world

  at first when he rose from the long deep sleep that
followed his rescue and the surrender of the council
he did not recognize his surroundings by an effort he
gained a clue in his mind and all that had happened
came back to him at first with a quality of insincerity

like a story heard like something read out of a book
and even before his memories were clear the exulta-
tion of his escape the wonder of his prominence were
back in his mind he was owner of half the world
master of the earth this new great age was in the
completest sense his he no longer hoped to discover
his experiences a dream he became anxious now to con-
vince himself that they were real

  an obsequious vale assisted him to dress under the
direction of a dignified chief attendant a little man
whose face proclaimed him japanese albeit he spoke
english like an englishman from the latter he learnt
something of the state of affairs already the revolu-
tion was an accepted fact already business was being
resumed throughout the city abroad the downfall of
the council had been received for the most part with de-
light nowhere was the council popular and the thou-
sand cities of western america after two hundred years
still jealous of new york london and the east had
risen almost unanimously two days before at the news
of grahams imprisonment paris was fighting within
itself the rest of the world hung in suspense

  while he was breaking his fast the sound of a tele-
phone bell jetted from a corner and his chief attendant
called his attention to the voice of ostrog making polite
inquiries graham interrupted his refreshment to reply
very shortly lincoln arrived and graham at once ex-
pressed a strong desire to talk to people and to be shown
more of the new life that was opening before him lin-
coln informed him that in three hours time a repre-
sentative gathering of officials and their wives would be
held in the state apartments of the wind-vane chief
grahams desire to traverse the ways of the city was
however at present impossible because of the enormous
excitement of the people it was however quite possible
for him to take a birds-eye view of the city from the
crows nest of the wind-vane keeper to this accordingly
graham was conducted by his- attendant lincoln with
a graceful compliment to the attendant apologized for
not accompanying them on account of the present pres-
sure of administrative work

  higher even than the most gigantic wind-wheels hung
this crows nest a clear thousand feet above the roofs
a little disc-shaped speck on a spear of metallic filigree
cable stayed to its summit graham was drawn in a
little wire-hung cradle halfway down the frail-seeming
stem was a light gallery about which hung a cluster
of tubes-minute they looked from above-rotating
slowly oii the ring of its outer rail these were the
specula era rapport with the wind-vane keepers mir-
rors in one of which ostrog had shown him the com-
ing of his rule his japanese attendant ascended before
him and they spent nearly an hour asking and answering
questions

  it was a day full of the promise and quality of spring
the touch of the wind warmed the sky was an intense
blue and the vast expanse of london shone dazzling
under the morning sun the air was clear of smoke
and haze sweet as the air of a mountain glen

  save for the irregular oval of ruins about the house
of the council and the black flag of the surrender that
fluttered there the mighty city seen from above showed
few signs of the swift revolution that had to his imag-
ination in one night and one day changed the destinies
of the world a multitude of people still swarmed over
these ruins and the huge openwork stagings in the dis-
tance from which started in times of peace the service
of aeroplanes to the various great cities of europe and
america were also black with the victors across a nar-
row way of planking raised on trestles that crossed the
ruins a crowd of workmen were busy restoring the con-
nection between the cables and wires of the council
house and the rest of the city preparatory to the trans-
when the sleeper wakes



fer thither of ostrogs headquarters from the wind-
vane buildings

  for the rest the luminous expanse was undisturbed
so vast was its serenity in comparison with the areas
of disturbance that presently graham looking beyond
them could almost forget the thousands of men lying
out of sight in the artificial glare within the quasi-sub-
terranean labyrinth dead or dying of the overnight
wounds forget the improvised wards with the hosts of
surgeons nurses and bearer feverishly busy forget
indeed all the wonder consternation and novelty under
the electric lights down there in the hidden ways of
the anthill he knew that the revolution triumphed that
black everywhere carried the day black favors black ban-
ners black festoons across the streets and out here
under the fresh sunlight beyond the crater of the fight
as if nothing had happened to the earth the forest of
wind vanes that had grown from one or two while the
council had ruled roared peacefully upon their inces-
sant duty

  far away spiked jagged and indented by the wind
vanes the surrey hills rose blue and faint to the north
and nearer the sharp contours of high gate and mus-
well hill were similarly jagged and all over the coun-
tryside he knew on every crest and hill where once the
hedges had interlaced and cottages churches inns and
farmhouses had nestled among their trees wind wheels
similar to those he saw and bearing like them vast ad-
vertisements gaunt and distinctive symbols of the new
age cast their whirling shadows and stored incessantly
the energy that flowed away incessantly through all the
arteries of the city and underneath these wandered
the countless flocks and herds of the british food trust
with their lonely guards and keepers

   not a familiar outline anywhere broke the cluster of
gigantic shapes below st pauls he knew survived and
many of the old buildings in westminster embedded out
of sight arched over and covered in among the giant
growths of this great age the thames too made no
fall and gleam of silver to break the wilderness of the
city the thirsty water mains drank up every drop of its
waters before they reached the walls its bed and estuary
scoured and sunken was now a canal of sea water and
a race of grimy bargemen brought the heavy materials
of trade from the pool thereby beneath the very feet of
the workers faint and dim in the eastward between
earth and sky hung the clustering masts of the colossal
shipping in the pool for all the heavy traffic for which
there was no need of haste came in gigantic sailing
ships from the ends of the earth and the heavy goods
for which there was urgency in mechanical ships of a
smaller swifter sort

   and to the south over the hills came vast aqueducts
with sea water for the sewers and in three separate
directions ran pallid lines-the roads stippled with mov-
ing grey specks on the first occasion that offered he
was determined to go out and see these roads that
would come after the flying ship he was presently to
try his attendant officer described them as a pair of
gently curving surfaces a hundred yards wide each
one for the traffic going in one direction and made of
a substance called eadhamite-an artificial substance
so far as he could gather resembling toughened glass
along this shot a strange traflc of narrow rubber-shod
vehicles great single wheels two and four wheeled
vehicles sweeping along at velocities of from one to
six miles a minute railroads had vanished a few
embankments remained as rust-crowned trenches here
and there some few formed the cores of eadhamite
ways

   among the first things to strike his attention had been
the great fleets of advertisement balloons and kites that
receded in irregular vistas northward and southward

along the lines of the aeroplane journeys no
aeroplanes were to be seen their passages had ceased
and only one little-seeming aeropile circled high in the
blue distance above the surrey hills an unimpressive
soaring speck

a thing graham had already learnt and which he
found very hard to imagine was that nearly all
the towns in the country and almost all the villages
had disappeared here and there only he understood
some gigantic hotel-like edifice stood amid square miles
of some single cultivation and preserved the name of
a town-as bournemouth wareham or swanage yet
the officer had speedily convinced him how inevitable
such a change had been the old order had dotted the
country with farmhouses and every two or three miles
was the ruling landlords estate and the place of the
inn and cobbler the grocers shop and church-the vil-
lage every eight miles or so was the country town
where lawyer corn merchant wool-stapler saddler
veterinary surgeon doctor draper milliner and so forth
lived every eight miles-simply because that eight
mile marketing journey four there and back was as
much as was comfortable for the farmer but directly
the railways came into play and after them the light
railways and all the swift new motor cars that had re-
placed wagons and horses and so soon as the high roads
began to be made of wood and rubber and eadhamite
and all sorts of elastic durable substances-the necessity
of having such frequent market towns disappeared and
the big towns grew they drew the worker with the
gravitational force of seemingly endless work the em-
ployer with their suggestions of an infinite ocean of
labor

   and as the standard of comfort rose as the com-
plexity of the mechanism of living increased life in the
country had become more and more costly or narrow
and impossible the disappearance of vicar and squire
the extinction of the general practitioner by the city
specialist had robbed the village of its last touch of cul-
ture after telephone kinematograph and phonograph
had replaced newspaper book schoolmaster and letter
to live outside the range of the electric cables was to
live an isolated savage in the country were neither
means of being clothed nor fed according to the re-
fined conceptions of the time no efficient doctors for
an emergency no company and no pursuits

moreover mechanical appliances in agriculture made
one engineer the equivalent of thirty laborers so in-
verting the condition of the city clerk in the days when
london was scarce inhabitable because of the coaly foul-
ness of its air the laborers now came hurrying by road
or air to the city and its life and delights at night to
leave it again in the morning the city had swallowed
up humanity man had entered upon a new stage in his
development first had come the nomad the hunter
then had followed the agriculturist of the agricultural
state whose towns and cities and ports were but the
headquarters and markets of the countryside and now
logical consequence of an epoch of invention was this
huge new aggregation of men save london there were
only four other cities in britain-edinburgh ports-
mouth manchester and shrewsbury such things as
these simple statements of fact though they were to
contemporary men strained grahams imagination to
picture and when he glanced over beyond there at
the strange things that existed on the continent it
failed him altogether

   he had a vision of city beyond city cities on great
plains cities beside great rivers vast cities along the
sea margin cities girdled by snowy mountains over
a great part of the earth the english tongue was spoken
taken together with its spanish american and hindoo

and negro and pidgin dialects it was the everyday
language of two-thirds of the people of the earth on
the continent save as remote and curious survivals
three other languages alone held sway-german which
reached to antioch and genoa and jostled spanish-
english at cadiz a gallicized russian which met the
indian english in persia and kurdistan and the pid-
gin english in pekin and french still clear and bril-
liant the language of lucidity which shared the medi-
terranean with the indian english and german and
reached through a negro dialect to the congo

  and everywhere now through the city-set earth save
in the administered black belt territories of the
tropics the same cosmopolitan social organization pre-
vailed and everywhere from pole to equator his prop-
erty and his responsibilities extended the whole world
was civilized the whole world dwelt in cities the whole
world was property over the british empire and
throughout america his ownership was scarcely dis-
guised congress and parliament were usually regarded
as antique curious gatherings and even in the two
empires of russia and germany the influence of his
wealth was conceivably of enormous weight there of
course came problems-possibilities but uplifted as he
was even russia and germany seemed sufficiently re-
mote and of the quality of the black belt administra-
tion and of what that might mean for him he thought
after the fashion of his former days not at all that it
should hang like a threat over the spacious vision before
him could not enter his nineteenth century mind but
his mind turned at once from the scenery to the thought
of a vanished dread what of the yellow peril he
asked and asano made him explain the chinese spec-
tre had vanished chinaman and european were at
peace the twentieth century had discovered with re-
luctant certainty that the average chinaman was as
civilized more moral and far more intelligent than
the average european serf and had repeated on a gigan-
tic scale the fraternization of scot and englishman that
happened in the seventeenth century as asano put it
they thought it over they found we were white men
after all graham turned again to the view and his
thoughts took a new direction

  out of the rim south-west glittering and strange
voluptuous and in some way terrible shone those
pleasure cities of which the kinematograph-phonograph
and the old man in the street had spoken strange
places reminiscent of the legendary sybaris cities of
art and beauty mercenary art and mercenary beauty
sterile wonderful cities of motion and music whither
repaired all who profited by the fierce inglorious eco-
nomic struggle that went on in the glaring labyrinth
below

  fierce he knew it was iiow fierce he could judge
from the fact that these latter-day people referred back
to the england of the nineteenth century as the figure
of an idyllic easy-going life he turned his eyes to the
scene immediately before him again trying to conceive
the big factories of that intricate maze

  northward he knew were the potters makers not
only of earthenware and china but of the kindred pastes
and compounds a subtler mineralogical chemistry had
devised there were the makers of statuettes and wall
ornaments and much intricate furniture there too were
the factories where feverishly competitive authors de-
vised their phonograph discourses and advertisements and
arranged the groupings and developments for their per-
petually startling and novel kinematographic dramatic
works thence too flashed the world-wide messages
the world-wide falsehoods of the news-tellers the
chargers of the telephonic machines that had replaced
the newspapers of the past

  to the westward beyond the smashed council house

were the voluminous offices of municipal control and gov-
ernment and to the eastward towards the port the
trading quarters the huge public markets the theatres
houses of resort betting palaces miles of billiard
saloons baseball and football circuses wild beast rings
and the innumerable temples of the christian and quasi-
christian sects the mahomedans buddhists gnostics
spook worshippers the incubus worshippers the furni-
ture worshippers and so forth and to the south again a
vast manufacture of textiles pickles wines and condi-
ments and from point to point tore the countless mul-
titudes along the roaring mechanical ways a gigan-
tic hive of which the winds were tireless servants and
the ceaseless wind-vanes an appropriate crown and
symbol

he thought of the unprecedented population that had
been sucked up by this sponge of halls and galleries
-the thirty-three million lives that were playing out
each its own brief ineffectual drama below him and the
complacency that the brightness of the day and the
space and splendor of the view and above all the sense
of his own importance had begotten dwindled and per-
ished looking down from this height over the city it
became at last possible to conceive this overwhelming
multitude of thirty-three millions the reality of the
responsibility he would take upon himself the vastness
of the human maelstrom over which his slender king-
ship hung

  he tried to figure the individual life it astonished
him to realize how little the common man had changed
in spite of the visible change in his conditions life
and property indeed were secure from violence almost
all over the world zymotic diseases bacterial diseases
of all sorts had practically vanished everyone had a
sufficiency of food and clothing and warmed in the
city ways and sheltered from the weather-so much the
almost mechanical progress of science and the physical
organization of society had accomplished but the crowd
he was already beginning to discover was a crowd still
helpless in the hands of demagogue and organizer in-
dividually cowardly individually swayed by appetite col-
lectively incalculable the memory of countless figures
in pale blue canvas came before his mind millions of
such men and women below him he knew had never
been out of the city had never seen beyond the little
round of unintelligent grudging participation in the
worlds business and unintelligent dissatisfied sharing
in its tawdrier pleasures he thought of the hopes of
his vanished contemporaries and for a moment the
dream of london in morriss quaint old news from no-
where and the perfect land of hudsons beautiful crystal
age appeared before him in an atmosphere of infinite
loss he thought of his own hopes

  for in the latter days of that passionate life that lay
now so far behind him the conception of a free and equal
manhood had become a very real thing to him he had
hoped as indeed his age had hoped rashly taking it for
granted that the sacrifice of the many to the few would
some day cease thac a day was near when every child
born of woman should have a fair and assured chance
of happiness and here after two hundred years the
same hope still unfulfilled cried passionately through
the city after two hundred years he knew greater
than ever grown with the city to gigantic proportions
were poverty and helpless labor and all the sorrows of
his time

  already he knew something of the history of the in-
tervening years he had heard now of the moral decay
that had followed the collapse of supernatural religion
in the minds of ignoble man the decline of public honor
the ascendency of wealth for men who had lost their
when the sleeper wakes



belief in god had still kept their faith in property and
wealth ruled a venial world

  his japanese attendant asano in expounding the
political history of the intervening two centuries drew
an apt image from a seed eaten by insect parasites first
there is the original seed ripening vigorously enough
and then comes some insect and lays an egg under the
skin and behold in a little while the seed is a hollow
shape with an active grub inside that has eaten out its
substance and then comes some secondary parasite
some ichneumon fly and lays an egg within this grub
and behold that too is a hollow shape and the new
living thing is inside its predecessors skin which itself
is snug within the seed coat and the seed coat still
keeps its shape most people think it a seed still and
for all one knows it may still think itself a seed vigor-
ous and alive your victorian kingdom said asano
was like that-kingship with the heart eaten out the
landowners-the barons and gentry-began ages ago
with king john there were lapses but they beheaded
king charles and ended practically with king george
a mere husk of a king    the real power in the
hands of their parliament but the parliament-the
organ of the land-holding tenant-ruling gentry-did not
keep its power long the change had already come in
the nineteenth century the franchises had been broad-
ened until it included masses of ignorant men urban
myriads who went in their featureless thousands to
vote together and the natural consequence of a swarm-
ing constituency is the rule of the party organization
power was passing even in the victorian time to the
party machinery secret complex and corrupt very
speedily power was in the hands of great men of
business who financed the machines a time came when
the real power and interest of the empire rested visibly
between the two party councils ruling by newspapers
and electoral organizations-two small groups of rich
and able men working at first in opposition then pres-
ently together

  there was a reaction of a genteel ineffectual sort
there were numberless books in existence asano said
to prove that-the publication of some of them was as
early as grahams sleep-a whole literature of reaction
in fact the party of the reaction seems to have locked
itself into its study and rebelled with unflinching de-
termination-on paper the urgent necessity of either
capturing or depriving the party councils of power is a
common suggestion underlying all the thoughtful work
of the early twentieth century both in america and
england in most of these things america was a little
earlier than england though both countries drove the
same way

  that counter-revolution never came it could never
organize and keep pure there was not enough of the
old sentimentality the old faith in righteousness left
among men any organization that became big enough
to influence the polls became complex enough to be un-
dermined broken up or bought outright by capable
rich men socialistic and popular reactionary and
purity parties were all at last mere stock exchange
counters selling their principles to pay for their elec-
tioneering and the great concern of the rich was natur-
ally to keep property intact the board clear for the
game of trade just as the feudal concern had been to
keep the board clear for hunting and war the whole
world was exploited a battlefield of businesses and
financial convulsions the scourge of currency manipula-
tion tariff wars made more human misery during the
twentieth century-because the wretchedness was dreary
life instead of speedy death-than had war pestilence
and famine in the darkest hours of earlier history

  his own part in the development of this time he now
knew clearly enough through the successive phases
in the development of this mechanical civilization aiding

and presently directing its development there had
grown a new power the council the board of his trustees
at first it had been a mere chance union of the millions
of isbister and warming a mere property holding com-
pany the creation of two childless testators whims but
the collective talent of its first constitution had speedily
guided it to a vast influence until by title deed loan
and share under a hundred disguises and pseudonyms
it had ramified through the fabric of the american and
english states

  wielding an enormous influence and patronage the
council had early assumed a political aspect and in
its development it had continually used its wealth to
tip the beam of political decisions and its political ad-
vantages to grasp yet more and more wealth at last
the party organizations of two hemispheres were in its
hands it became an inner council of political control
its last struggle was with the tacit alliance of the great
jewish families but these families were linked only
by a feeble sentiment at any time inheritance might
fling a huge fragment of their resources to a minor a
woman or a fool marriages and legacies alienated hun-
dreds of thousands at one blow the council had no
such breach in its continuity steadily steadfastly it
grew

the original council was not simply twelve men of
exceptional ability they fused it was a council of
genius it struck boldly for riches for political influ-
ence and the two subserved each other with amazing
foresight it spent great sums of money on the art of
flying holding that invention back against an hour fore-
seen it used the patent laws and a thousand half-legal
expedients to hamper all investigators who refused to
work with it in the old days it never missed a capable
man it paid his price its policy in those days was
vigorous-unerring and against it as it grew steadily
and incessantly was only the chaotic selfish rule of the
casually rich in a hundred years graham had become
almost exclusive owner of africa of south america of
france of london of england and all its influence-
for all practical purposes that is-a power in north
america-then the dominant power in america the
council bought an organized china drilled asia crippled
the old world empires undermined them financially
fought and defeated them

  and this spreading usurpation of the world was so
dexterously performed-a proteus-hundreds of banks
companies syndicates masked the councils operations
-that it was already far advanced before common men
suspected the tyranny that had come the council never
hesitated never faltered means of communication land
buildings governments municipalities the territorial
companies of the tropics every human enterprise it gath-
ered greedily and it drilled and marshalled its men
its railway police its roadway police its house guards
and drain and cable guards its hosts of land-workers
their unions it did not fight but it undermined and
betrayed and bought them it bought the world at last
and finally its culminating stroke was the introduction
of flying

  when the council in conflict with the workers in
some of its huge monopolies did something flagrantly
illegal and that without even the ordinary civility of
bribery the old law alarmed for the profits of its com-
plaisance looked about it for weapons but there were
no more armies no fighting navies the age of peace
had come the only possible war ships were the great
steam vessels of the councils navigation trust the
police forces they controlled the police of the railways
of the ships cf their agricultural estates their time-
keepers and order-keepers outnumbered the neglected
little forces of the old country and municipal organiza-
tions ten to one and they produced flying machines


amazing stories quarterly

there were men alive still who could remember the
last great debate in the london house of commons-
the legal party the party against the council was in a
minority but it made a desperate fight-and how the
members came crowding out upon the terra-  to see these
great unfamiliar winged shapes circling quietly over-
head the council had soared to its power the last
sham of democracy that had permitted unlimited irre-
sponsible property was at an end

   within one hundred and fifty years of grahams fall-
ing asleep his council had thrown off its disguises and
ruled openly supreme in his name elections had be-
come a cheerful formality a septennial folly an ancient
unmeaning custom a social parliament as ineffectual
as the convocation of the established church in vic-
torian times assembled now and then and a legitimate
king of england disinherited drunken and witless
played foolishly in a second-rate music-hall so the mag-
nificent dream of the nineteenth century the noble
project of universal individual liberty and universal hap-
piness touched by a disease of honor crippled by a
superstition of absolute property crippled by the re-
ligious feuds that had robbed the common citizens
of education robbed men of standards of conduct
and brought the sanctions of morality to utter con-
tempt had worked itself out in the face of invention and
ignoble enterprise first to a warring plutocracy and
finally to the rule of a supreme plutocrat his council
at last had ceased even to trouble to have its decrees
endorsed by the constitutional authorities and he a mo-
tionless sunken yellow-skinned figure had lain neither
dead nor living recognizably and immediately master of
the earth and awoke at last to find himself-master
of that inheritance awoke to stand under the cloud-
less empty sky and gaze down upon the greatness of his
dominion

	to what end had he awakened was this city this
hive of hopeless toilers the final refutation of his ancient
hopes or was the fire of liberty the fire that had
blazed and waned in the years of his past life still
smouldering below there he thought of the stir and
impulse of the song of the revolution was that song
merely the trick of a demagogue to be forgotten when
its purpose was served was the hope that still stirred
within him only the memory of abandoned things the
vestige of a creed outworn or had it a wider mean-
ing an import interwoven with the destiny of man
to what end had he awakened what was there for him
to do humanity was spread below him like a map
he thought of the millions and millions of humanity
following each other unceasingly for ever out of the
darkness of non-existence into the darkness of death
ito what end aid there must be but it transcended
his power of thought he saw for the first time clearly
his own infinite littleness saw stark and terrible the
tragic contrast of human strength and the craving of
the human heart for that little while he knew himself
for the petty accident he was and knew therewith the
greatness of his desire and suddenly his littleness
was intolerable his aspiration was intolerable and there
came to him an irresistible impulse to pray and he
prayed he prayed vague incoherent contradictory
things his soul strained up through time and space and
all the fleeting multitudinous confusion of being to-
wards something-he scarcely knew what-towards
something that could comprehend his striving and en-
dure

  a man and a woman were far below on a roof space
to the southward enjoying the freshness of the morn-
ing air the man had brought out a perspective glass
to spy upon the council house and he was showing her
how to use it presently their curiosity was satisfied
they could see no traces of bloodshed from their position
and after a survey of the empty sky she came round to

the crows nest and there she saw two little black
figures so small it was hard to believe they were men
one who watched and one who gesticulated with hands
outstretched to the silent emptiness of heaven

  she handed the glass to the man he looked and
exclaimed

   i believe it ij the master yes i a a sure it is
the master

  he lowered the glass and looked at her waving
his hands about almost as if he was praying i wonder
what he is up to worshipping the sun there werent
parsees in this country in his time were there

   he looked again hes stopped it now it was a
chance attitude i suppose he put own the glas
and became meditative he wont have anything to
do but enjoy himself-just enjoy himself ostrog will
boss the show of course ostrog will have to because
of keeping all these laborer fools in bounds them
and their song and got it all by sleeping dear eyes
-just sleeping its a wonderful world

prominent people

the state apartments of the wind vane keeper
would have seemed astonishingly intricate to gra-
ham had he entered them fresh from his nineteenth
century life but already he was growing accustomed to
the scale of the new time they can scarcely be de-
scribed as halls and rooms seeing that a complicated
system of arches bridges passages and galleries divided
and united every part of the great space he came out
through one of the now familiar sliding panels upon a
plateau or landing at the head of a flight of very broad
and gentle steps with men and women far more bril-
liantly dressed than any he had hitherto seen ascending
and descending from this position he looked down a
vista of intricate ornament in lustreless white and
mauve and purple spanned by bridges that seemed
wrought of porcelain and filigree and terminating far off
in a cloudy mystery of perforated screens

   glancing upward he saw tier above tier of ascending
galleries with faces looking down upon him the air
was full of the babble of innumerable voices of a music
that descended from above a gay and exhilarating music
whose source he never discovered

   the central aisle was thick with people but by no
means uncomfortably crowded altogether that assem-
bly must have numbered many thousands they were
brilliantly even fantastically dressed the men as fanci-
fully as the women for the sobering influence of the
puritan conception of dignity upon masculine dress
had long since passed away the hair of the men too
though it was rarely worn long was commonly curled
in a manner that suggested the barber and baldness
had vanished from the earth frizzy straight-cut masses
that would have charmed rosetti abounded and one gen-
tleman who was pointed out to graham under the mys-
terious title of an amorist wore his hair in two be-
coming plaits a la marguerite the pigtail was in evi-
dence it would seem that citizens of chinese extraction
were no longer ashamed of their race there was little
uniformity of fashion apparent in the forms of clothing
worn the more shapely men displayed their symmetry
in trunk hose and here were puffs and slashes and there
a cloak and there a robe the fashions of the days of
leo the tenth were perhaps the prevailing influence
but the aesthetic conceptions of the far east were also
patent masculine embonpoint which in victorian
times would have been subjected to the tightly buttoned
perils the ruthless exaggeration of tight-legged tight-
armed evening dress now formed but the basis of a
wealth of dignity and drooping folds graceful slender-
ness abounded also to graham a typically stiff man
when the sleeper wakes



from a typically stiff period not only did these men
seem altogether too graceful in person but altogether
too expressive in their vividly expressive faces they
gesticulated they expressed surprise interest amuse-
ment above all they expressed the emotions excited in
their minds by the ladies about them with astonishing
frankness even at the first glance it was evident that
women were in a great majority

  the ladies in the company of these gentlemen dis-
played in dress bearing and manner alike less emphasis
and more intricacy some affected a classical simplicity
of robing and subtlety of fold after the fashion of the
first french empire and flashed conquering arms and
shoulders as graham passed others had closely-fitting
dresses without seam or belt at the waist sometimes
with long fold falling from the shoulders the delight-
ful confidences of evening dress had not been diminished
by the passage of two centuries

  everyones movements seemed graceful graham re-
marked to lincoln that he saw men as raphaels cartoons
walking and lincoln told him that the attainment of an
appropriate set of gestures was part of every rich per-
sons education the masters entry was greeted with a
sort of tittering applause but these people showed their
distinguished manners by not crowding upon him nor
annoying him by any persistent scrutiny as he descended
the steps towards the floor of the aisle

  he had already learnt from lincoln that these were
the leaders of existing london society almost every
person there that night was either a powerful official
or the immediate connection of a powerful official many
had returned from the european pleasure cities ex-
pressly to welcome him the aeronautic authorities
whose defection had played a part in the overthrow of
the council only second to grahams were very promi-
nent and so too was the wind vane control amongst
others there were several of the more prominent officers
of the food trust the controller of the european pig-
geries had a particularly melancholy and interesting
countenance and a daintily cynical manner a bishop
in full canonicals passed athwart grahams vision con-
versing with a gentleman dressed exactly like the tradi-
tional chaucer including even the laurel wreath

  who is that he asked almost involuntarily

  the bishop of london said lincoln

  no-the other i mean

  poet laureate

  you still-

  he doesnt make poetry of course hes a cousin
of wotton-one of the councillors but hes one of
the red rose royalists-a delightful club-and they
keep up the tradition of these things

  asano told me there was a king

  the king doesnt belong they had to expel him
its the stuart blood i suppose but really-

  too much

  far too much

  graham did not quite follow all this but it seemed
part of the general inversion of the new age he bowed
condescendingly to his first introduction it was evi-
dent that subtle distinctions of class prevailed even in
this assembly that only to a small proportion of the
guests to an inner group did lincoln consider it ap-
propriate to introduce him this first introduction was
the master aeronaut a man whose sun-tanned face con-
trasted oddly with the delicate complexions about him
just at present his critical defection from the council
made him a very important person indeed

  ilis manner contrasted very favorably according to
grahams ideas with the general bearing he made a
few commonplace remarks assurances of loyalty and
frank inquiries about the masters health his manner
was breezy his accent lacked the easy staccato of latter-
day english he made it admirably clear to graham

that he was a bluff aerial dog-he used that phrase-
that there was no nonsense about him that he was a
thoroughly manly fellow and old-fashioned at that that
he didnt profess to know much and that what he did
not know was not worth knowing he made a manly
bow ostentatiously free from obsequiousness and
passed

i am glad to see that type endures said graham
phonographs and kinematographs said lincoln a
little spitefully he has studied from the life graham
glanced at the burly form again it was oddly
reminiscent

  as a matter of fact we bought him said lincoln
partly and partly he was afraid of ostrog every-
thing rested with him

  he turned sharply to introduce the surveyor-gen-
eral of the public school trust this person was a
willowy figure in a blue-grey academic gown he
beamed down upon graham through pince-nez of a
victorian pattern and illustrated his remarks by ges-
tures of a beautifully manicured hand graham was
immediately interested in this gentlemans functions
and asked him a number of singularly direct questions
the surveyor-general seemed quietly amused at the
masters fundamental bluntness he was a little vague
as to the monopoly of education his company possessed
it was done by contract with the syndicate that ran the
numerous london municipalities but he waxed en-
thusiastic over educational progress since the victorian
times we have conquered cram he said completely
conquered cram-there is not an examination left in
the world arent you glad

  how do you get the work done asked graham

  we make it attractive-as attractive as possible
and if it does not attract then-we let it go we cover
an immense field

he proceeded to details and they had a lengthy
conversation the surveyor-general mentioned
the names of pestalozzi and froebel with profound re-
spect although he displayed no intimacy with their
epoch-making words graham learnt that university
extension still existed in a modified form there is
a certain type of girl for example said the surveyor-
general dilating with a sense of his usefulness with
a perfect passion for severe studies-when they are not
too difficult you know we cater to them by the thou-
sand at this moment he said with a napoleonic
touch nearly five hundred phonographs are lecturing
in different parts of london on the influence exercised
by plato and swift on the love affairs of shelley haz-
litt and burns and afterwards they write essays on
the lectures and the names in order of merit are put
in conspicuous places you see how your little germ
has grown the illiterate middle-class of your days
has quite passed away

  about the public elementary schools said graham
do you control them

  the surveyor-general did entirely now graham
in his later democratic days had taken a keen interest
in these and his questioning quickened certain casual
phrases that had fallen from the old man with whom
he had talked in the darkness recurred to him the
surveyor-general in effect endorsed the old mans
words we have abolished cram he said a phrase
graham was beginning to interpret as the abolition of
all sustained work the surveyor-general became senti-
mental we try and make the elementary schools very
pleasant for the little children they will have to work
so soon just a few simple principles-obedience-in-
dustry

  you teach them very little

  why should we it only leads to trouble and dis-
content we amuse them even as it is-there are

troubles-agitations where the laborers get the
ideas one cannot tell they tell one another there
are socialistic dreams-anarchy even agitators will
get to work among them i take it-i have always
taken it-that my foremost duty is to fight against pop-
ular discontent why should people be made unhappy
 wonder said graham thoughtfully but there
are a great many things i want to know

  lincoln who had stood watching grahams face
throughout the conversation intervened there are
others he said in an undertone

  the surveyor-general of schools gesticulated him-
self away perhaps said lincoln intercepting a
casual glance you would like to know some of these
ladies

  the daughter of the manager of the piggeries of
the european food trust was a particularly charming
little person with red hair and animated blue eyes
lincoln left him awhile to converse with her and she
displayed herself as quite an enthusiast for the dear
old times as she called them that had seen the begin-
ning of his trance as she talked she smiled and her
eyes smiled in a manner that demanded reciprocity

   i have tried she said countless times-to imagine
those old romantic days and to you-they are memo-
ries how strange and crowded the world must seem
to you i have seen photographs and pictures of the
old times the little isolated houses built of bricks made
out of burnt mud and all black with soot from your fires
the railway bridges the simple advertisements the
solemn savage puritanical men in strange black coats
and those tall hats of theirs iron railway trains on
iron bridges overhead horses and cattle and even dogs
running half wild about the streets and suddenly
you have come into this

   into this said graham

   out of your life-out of all that was familiar

  the old life was not a happy one said graham i
do not regret that

  she looked at him quickly there was a brief pause
she sighed encouragingly no

  no said graham it was a little life-and un-
meaning but this- we thought the world com-
plex and crowded and civilised enough yet i see-
although in this world i am barely four days old-
looking back on my own time that it was a queer bar-
baric time-the mere beginning of this new order the
mere beginning of this new order you will find it
hard to understand how little i know

  you may ask me what you like she said smiling
at him

  then tell me who these people are im still very
much in the dark about them its puzzling are there
any generals

  men in hats and feathers

  of course not no i suppose they are the men
who control the great public businesses who is that
distinguished looking man

  that hes a most important officer that is mor-
den he is managing director of the antibilious pill
company i have heard that his workers sometimes
urn out a myriad myriad pills a day in twenty-four hours
fancy a myriad myriad

  a myriad myriad no wonder he looks proud said
graham pills what a wonderful time it is that
man in purple

  he is not quite one of the inner circle you know
but we like him he is really clever and very amus-
ing he is one of the heads of the medical faculty of
our london university all medical men you know
are shareholders in the medical faculty company and
wear that purple you have to be-to be qualified but
of course people who are paid by fees for doing some-

thing- she smiled away the social pretensions of all
such people

  are any of your great artists or authors here

  no authors they are mostly such queer people-
and so preoccupied about themselves and they quarrel
so dreadfully they will fight some of them for prece-
dence on staircases dreadful isnt it but i think
wraysbury the fashionable capillotomist is here from
capri

  capillotomist said graham ah i remember an
artist why not

  we have to cultivate him she said apologetically
our heads are in his hands she smiled

  graham hesitated at the invited compliment but his
glance was expressive have the arts grown with the
rest of civilised things he said who are your great
painters

  she looked at him doubtfully then laughed for a
moment she said i thought you meant- she laughed
again you mean of course those good men you used
to think so much of because they could cover great spaces
of canvas with oil-colours great oblongs and people
used to put the things in gilt frames and hang them up
in rows in their square rooms we havent any people
grew tired of that sort of thing

  but what did you think i meant

  she put a finger significantly on a cheek whose glow
was above suspicion and smiled and looked very arch
and pretty and inviting and here and she indicated
her eyelid

graham had an adventurous moment then a gro-
tesque memory of a picture he had somewhere
seen of uncle toby and the widow flashed across his
mind an archaic shame came upon him he became
acutely aware that he was visible to a great number of
interested people i see he remarked inadequately
he turned awkwardly away from her fascinating facility
he looked about him to meet a number of eyes that im-
mediately occupied themselves with other things pos-
sibly he coloured a little who is that talking with the
lady in saffron he asked avoiding her eyes

  the person in question he learnt was one of the great
organisers of the american theatres just fresh from a
gigantic production at mexico his face reminded gra-
ham of a bust of caligula another striking looking
man was the black labour master the phrase at the
time made no deep impression but afterwards it re-
curred-the black labour master the little lady in
no degree embarrassed pointed out to him a charming
little woman as one of the subsidiary wives of the an-
gelican bishop of london she added encomiums on the
episcopal courage-hitherto there had been a rule of
clerical monogamy-neither a natural nor an expedient
condition of things why should the natural develop-
ment of the affections be dwarfed and restricted because
a man is a priest

  and by the bye she added are you an anglican
graham was on the verge of hesitating inquiries about
the status of a subsidiary wife apparently an euphe-
mistic phrase when lincolns return broke off this very
suggestive and interesting conversation they crossed
the aisle to where a tall man in crimson and two charm-
ing persons in burmese costume as it seemed to him
awaited him diffidently from their civilities he passed
to other presentations

  in a little while his multitudinous impressions began
to organise themselves into a general effect at first
the glitter of the gathering had raised all the democrat
in graham he had felt hostile and satirical but it
is not in human nature to resist an atmosphere of cour-
teous regard soon the music the light the play of
colours the shining arms and shoulders about him the
touch of hands the transient interest of smiling faces
when the sleeper wakes



the frothing sound of skilfully modulated voices the at-
mosphere of compliment interest and respect had woven
together into a fabric of indisputable pleasure graham
for a time forgot his spacious resolutions he gave
way insensibly to the intoxication of the position that
was conceded him his manner became less conscious
more convincingly regal his feet walked assuredly the
black robe fell with a bolder fold and pride ennobled
his voice after all this was a brilliant interesting world

  his glance went approvingly over the shifting colours
of the people it rested here and there in kindly criticism
upon a face presently it occurred to him that he owed
some apology to the charming little person with the red
hair and blue eyes he felt guilty of a clumsy snub
it was not princely to ignore her advances even if his
policy necessitated their rejection he wondered if he
should see her again and suddenly a little thing touched
all the glamour of this brilliant gathering and changed
its quality

  he looked up and saw passing across a bridge of
porcelain and looking down upon him a face that was
almost immediately hidden the face of the girl he had
seen overnight in the little room beyond the theatre
after his escape from the council and she was look-
ing with much the same expression of curious expec-
tation of uncertain intentness upon his proceedings
for the moment he did not remember when he had
seen her and then with recognition came a vague mem-
ory of the stirring emotions of their first encounter
but the dancing web of melody about him kept the air
of that great marching song from his memory

  the lady to whom he was talking repeated her remark
and graham recalled himself to the quasi-regal flirtation
upon which he was engaged

  but from that moment a vague restlessness a feeling
that grew to dissatisfaction came into his mind he
was troubled as if by some half forgotten duty by the
sense of things important slipping from him amidst this
light and brilliance the attraction that these bright
ladies who crowded about him were beginning to exer-
cise ceased he no longer made vague and clumsy re-
sponses to the subtly amorous advances that he was now
assured were being made to him and his eyes wandered
for another sight of that face that had appealed so
strongly to his sense of beauty but he did not see her
again until he was awaiting lincolns return to leave
this assembly in answer to his request lincoln had
promised that an attempt should be made to fly that
afternoon if the weather permitted he had gone to
make certain necessary arrangements

  graham was in one of the upper galleries in conver-
sation with a bright-eyed lady on the subject of eadha-
mite-the subject was his choice and not hers he
had interrupted her warm assurances of personal de-
votion with a matter-of-fact inquiry he found her as
he had already found several other latter-day women
that night less well informed than charming suddenly
struggling against the eddying drift of nearer melody
the song of the revolt the great song he had heard in
the hall hoarse and massive came beating down to him

  he glanced up startled and perceived above him an
oeil de boeuf through which this song had come and
beyond the upper courses of cable the blue haze and
the pendant fabric of the lights of the public ways he
heard the song break into a tumult of voices and cease
but now he perceived quite clearly the drone and tumult
of the moving platforms and a murmur of many people
he had a vague persuasion that he could not account for
a sort of instinctive feeling that outside in the ways a
huge crowd must be watching this place in which their
master amused himself he wondered what they might
be thinking

  though the song had stopped so abruptly though
the special music of this gathering reasserted itself the

  motif of the marching song once it had begun lingered
in his mind

  the bright-eyed lady was still struggling with the
mysteries of eadhamite when he perceived the girl he
had seen in the theatre again she was coming now
along the gallery towards him he saw her first before
she saw him she was dressed in a faintly luminous
grey her dark hair about her brows was like a cloud
and as he saw her the cold light from the circular opening
into the ways fell upon her downcast face

  the lady in trouble about the eadhamite saw the
change in his expression and grasped her opportunity
to escape would you care to know that girl sire
she asked boldly she is helen wotton-a niece of
ostrogs she knows a great many serious things she
is one of the most serious persons alive i am sure you
will like her

  in another moment graham was talking to the girl
and the bright-eyed lady had fluttered away

  i remember you quite well said graham you
were in that little room when all the people were sing-
ing and beating time with their feet before i walked
across the hall

  her momentary embarrassment passed she looked up
at him and her face was steady it was wonderful
she said hesitated and spoke with a sudden effort all
those people would have died for you sire countless
people did die for you that night

  her face glowed she glanced swiftly aside to see
that no other heard her words

  lincoln appeared some way off along the gallery
making his way through the press towards them she
saw him and turned to graham strangely eager with a
swift change to confidence and intimacy sire she
said quickly i cannot tell you now and here but the
common people are very unhappy they are oppressed-
they are misgoverned do not forget the people who
faced death-death that you might live

  i know nothing- began graham

  i cannot tell you now

  lincolns face appeared close to them he bowed an
apology to the girl

  you find the new world pleasant sire asked lin-
coln with smiling deference and indicating the space
and splendour of the gathering by one comprehensive
gesture at any rate you find it changed

  yes said graham changed and yet after all
not so greatly changed

  wait till you are in the air said lincoln the
wind has fallen even now an aeropile awaits you

  the girls attitude awaited dismissal

  graham glanced at her face was on the verge of a
question found a warning in her expression bowed to
her and turned to accompany lincoln

chapter xvi

the aeropile

for a while as graham went through the passages
of the wind-vane offices with lincoln he was pre-
occupied but by an effort he attended to the
things which lincoln was saying soon his preoccupa-
tion vanished lincoln was talking of flying graham
had a strong desire to know more of this new human at-
tainment he began to ply lincoln with questions he
had followed the crude beginnings of aerial navigation
very keenly in his previous life he was delighted to find
the familiar names of maxim and pilcher langley and
chanute and above all of the aerial proto-martyr lillien-
thal still honored by men

  even during his previous life two lines of investiga-
tion had pointed clearly to two distinct types of con-
trivance as possible and both of these had been realized
on the one hand was the great engine-driven aeroplane
a double row of horizontal floats with a big aerial screw
s

the ttcropilc

  behind and on the other the nimbler aeropile the aero-
planes flew safely only in a calm or moderate wind and
sudden storms occurrences that were now accurately
predictable rendered them for all practical purposes
useless they were built of enormous size-the usual
stretch of wing being six hundred feet or more and the
length of the fabric a thousand feet they were for
passenger traffic alone the lightly swung car they car-
ried was from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet in
length it was hung in a peculiar manner in order to
minimize the complex vibration that even a moderate
wind produced and for the same reason the little seats
within the car-each passenger remained seated during
the voyage-were slung with great freedom of movement
the starting of the mechanism was only possible from
a gigantic car on the rail of a specially constructed stage
graham had seen these vast stages the flying stages
from the crows nest very well six huge blank areas
they were with a giant carrier stage on each

  the choice of descent was equally circumscribed an
accurately plane surface being needed for safe ground-
ing apart from the destruction that would have been
caused by the descent of this great expanse of sail and
metal and the impossibility of its rising again the con-
cussion of an irregular surface a tree-set hillside for
instance or an embankment would be sufficient to pierce

  or damage the framework to smash the ribs of the
body and perhaps kill those aboard

  at first graham felt disappointed with these cum-
bersome contrivances but he speedily grasped the fact
that smaller machines would have been unremunerative
for the simple reason that their carrying power would be
disproportionately diminished with diminished size more-
over the huge size of these things enabled them-and
it was a consideration of primary importance-to traverse
the air at enormous speeds and so run no risks of unan-
ticipated weather the briefest journey performed that
from london to paris took about three-quarters of an
hour but the velocity attained was not high the leap
to new york occupied about two hours and by timing
oneself carefully at the intermediate stations it was pos-
sible in quiet weather to go around the world in a day

  the little aeropiles as for no particular reason they
were distinctively called were of an altogether different
type several of these were going to and fro in the
air they were designed to carry only one or two per-
sons and their manufacture and maintenance was so
costly as to render them the monopoly of the richer
sort of people their sails which were brilliantly col-
ored consisted only of two pairs of lateral air floats
in the same plane and of a screw behind their small
size rendered a descent in any open space neither difficult
when the sleeper wakes



nor disagreeable and it was possible to attach pneumatic
wheels or even the ordinary motors for terrestrial traffic
to them and so carry them to a convenient starting place
they required a special sort of swift car to throw them
into the air but such a car was efficient in any open
place clear of high buildings or trees human aero-
nautics graham perceived were evidently still a long
way behind the instinctive gift of the albatross or the
fly-catcher one great influence that might have brought
the aeropile to a more rapid perfection had been with-
held these inventions had never been used in warfare
the last great international struggle had occurred before
the usurpation of the council

  the flying stages of london were collected together
in an irregular crescent on the southern side of the river
they formed three groups of two each and retained
the names of ancient suburban hills or villages they
were named in order roehampton wimbledon park
streatham norwood blackheath and shooters hill
they were uniform structures rising high above the gen-
eral roof surfaces each was about four thousand yards
long and a thousand broad and constructed of the com-
pound of aluminum and iron that had replaced iron in
architecture their higher tiers formed an openwork of
girders through which lifts and staircases ascended
the upper surface was a uniform expanse with portions
-the starting carriers-that could be raised and were
then able to run on very slightly inclined rails to the end
of the fabric save for any aeropiles or aeroplanes that
were in port these open surfaces were kept clear for
arrivals

  during the adjustment of the aeroplanes it was the
custom for passengers to wait in the system of theatres
restaurants news-rooms and places of pleasure and in-
dulgence of various sorts that interwove with the pros-
perous shops below this portion of london was in con-
sequence commonly the gayest of all its districts with
something of the meretricious gaiety of a seaport or city
of hotels and for those who took a more serious view
of aeronautics the religious quarters had flung out an
attractive colony of devotional chapels while a host of
brilliant medical establishments competed to supply phys-
ical preparatives for the journey at various levels
through the mass of chambers and passages beneath these
ran in addition to the main moving ways of the city
which laced and gathered here a complex system of
special passages and lifts and slides for the convenient
interchange of people and luggage between stage and
stage and a distinctive feature of the architecture of
this section was the ostentatious massiveness of the
metal piers and girders that everywhere broke the vistas
and spanned the halls and passages crowding and twin-
ing up to meet the weight of the stages and the weighty
impact of the aeroplanes overhead

  graham went to the flying stages by the public ways
he was accompanied by asano his japanese attendant
lincoln was called away by ostrog who was busy with
his administrative concerns a strong guard of the
wind-vane police awaited the master outside the wind-
vane offices and they cleared a space for him on the
upper moving platform his passage to the flying stages
was unexpected nevertheless a considerable crowd gath-
ered and followed him to his destination as he went
along he could hear the people shouting his name and
saw numberless men and women and children in blue
come swarming up the staircases in the central path
gesticulating and shouting he could not hear what they
shouted he was struck again by the evident existence
of a vulgar dialect among the poor of the city when
at last he descended his guards were immediately sur-
rounded by a dense excited crowd afterwards it oc-
curred to him that some had attempted to reach him
with petitions his guards cleared a passage for him
with difficulty

he found an aeropile in charge of an aeronaut await-
ing him on the westward stage seen close this
mechanism was no longer small as it lay on its launch-
ing carrier upon the wide expanse of the flying stage
its aluminum body skeleton was as big as the hull of a
twenty-ton yacht its lateral supporting sails braced
and stayed with metal nerves almost like the nerves of
a bees wing and made of some sort of glassy artificial
membrane cast their shadow over many hundreds of
square yards the chairs for the engineer and his
passenger hung free to swing by a complex tackle within
the protecting ribs of the frame and well abaft the middle
the passengers chair was protected by a wind-guard
and guarded about with metallic rods carrying air cush-
ions it could if desired be completely closed in but
graham was anxious for novel experiences and desired
that it should be left open the aeronaut sat behind a
glass that sheltered his face the passenger could secure
himself firmly in his seat and this was almost unavoid-
able on landing or he could move along by means of a
little rail and rod to a locker at the stem of the machine
where his personal luggage his wraps and restoratives
were placed and which also with the seats served as a
makeweight to the parts of the central engine that pro-
jected to the propeller at the stern

  the engine was very simple in appearance asano
pointing out the parts of this apparatus to him told
him that like the gas-engine of victorian days it was
of the explosive type burning a small drop of a sub-
stance called fomile at each stroke it consisted simply
of reservoir and piston about the long fluted crank of
the propeller shaft so much graham saw of the machine

  the flying stage about him was empty save for asano
and their suite of attendants directed by the aeronaut
he placed himself in his seat he then drank a mixture
containing ergot-a dose he learnt invariably adminis-
tered to those about to fly and designed to counteract
the possible effect of diminished air pressure upon the
system having done so he declared himself ready for
the journey asano took the empty glass from him
stepped through the bars of the hull and stood below
on the stage and waved his hand suddenly he seemed
to glide along the stage to the right and vanish

  the engine was beating the propeller spinning and
for a second the stage and the buildings beyond were
gliding swiftly and horizontally past grahams eye then
these things seemed to tilt up abruptly he gripped
the little rods on either side of him instinctively he
felt himself moving upward heard the air whistle over
the top of the wind screen the propeller screw moved
round with powerful rhythmic impulses-one two
three pause one two three-which the engineer con-
trolled very delicately the machine began a quivering
vibration that continued throughout the flight and the
roof areas seemed running away to starboard very quickly
and growing rapidly smaller he looked from the face of
the engineer through the ribs of the machine looking
sideways there was nothing very startling in what he saw
-a rapid funicular railway might have given the same
sensations he recognised the council house and the
highgate ridge and then he looked straight down
between his feet

  for a moment physical terror possessed him a pas-
sionate sense of insecurity he held tight for a sec-
ond or so he could not lift his eyes some hundred
feet or more sheer below him was one of the big wind-
vanes of south-west london and beyond it the south-
ernmost flying stage crowded with little black dots these
things seemed to be falling away from him for a sec-
ond he had an impulse to pursue the earth he set his
teeth he lifted his eyes by a muscular effort and the
moment of panic passed

  he remained for a space with his teeth set hard his
eyes staring into the sky throb throb throb-beat
	amazing stories quarterly

went the engine throb throb throb-beat he gripped
his bars tightly glanced at the aeronaut and saw a smile
upon his sun-tanned face he smiled in return-perhaps
a little artificially a little strange at first he shouted
before he recalled his dignity but he dared not look
down again for some time he stared over the aeronauts
head to where a rim of vague blue horizon crept up the
sky for a little while he could not banish the thought
of possible accidents from his mind throb throb throb
-beat suppose some trivial screw went wrong in that
supporting engine suppose- he made a grim effort
to dismiss all such suppositions after a while they did
at least abandon the foreground of his thoughts and
up he went steadily higher and higher into the clear
air

  once the mental shock of moving unsupported through
the air was over his sensations ceased to be unpleasant
became very speedily pleasurable he had been warned
of air sickness but he found the pulsating movement
of the aeropile as it drove up the faint south-west breeze
was very little in excess of the pitching of a boat head on
to broad rollers in a moderate gale and he was constitu-
tionally a good sailor and the keenness of the more
rarefied air into which they ascended produced a sense of
lightness and exhilaration he looked up and saw the
blue sky above fretted with cirrus clouds his eye came
cautiously down through the ribs and bars to a shining
flight of white birds that hung in the lower sky for a
space he watched these then going lower and less appre-
hensively he saw the slender figure of the wind-vane
keepers crows nest shining golden in the sunlight and
growing smaller every moment as his eye fell with
more confidence now there came a blue line of hills and
then london already to leeward an intricate space of
roofing its near edge came sharp and clear and ban-
ished his last apprehensions in a shock of surprise for
the boundary of london was like a wall like a cliff a
steep fall of three or four hundred feet a frontage broken
only by terraces here and there a complex decorative
facade

  that gradual passage of town into country through
an extensive sponge of suburbs which was so character-
istic a feature of the great cities of the nineteenth
century existed no longer nothing remained of it but
a waste of ruins here variegated and dense with thickets
of the heterogeneous growths that had once adorned
the gardens of the belt interspersed among levelled brown
patches of sown ground and verdant stretches of winter
greens the latter even spread among the vestiges of
houses but for the most part the reefs and skerries of
ruins the wreckage of suburban villas stood among
their streets and roads queer islands amidst the levelled
expanses of green and brown abandoned indeed by the
inhabitants years since but too substantial it seemed to
be cleared out of the way of the wholesale horticultural
mechanisms of the time

  the vegetation of this waste undulated and frothed
amidst the countless cells of crumbling house walls and
broke along the foot of the city wall in a surf of bramble
and holly and ivy and teazle and tall grasses here and
there gaudy pleasure palaces towered amidst the puny
remains of victorian times and cable ways slanted to
them from the city that winter day they seemed de-
serted deserted too were the artificial gardens among
the ruins the city limits were indeed as sharply de-
fined as in the ancient days when the gates were shut at
nightfall and the robber foeman prowled to the very
walls a huge semi-circular throat poured out a vigorous
traffic upon the eadhamite bath road so the first pros-
pect of the world beyond the city flashed on graham and
dwindled and when at last he could look vertically
downward again he saw below him the vegetable fields
of the thames valley-innumerable minute oblongs of

ruddy brown intersected by shining threads the sewage
ditches	

his exhilaration increased rapidly became a sort of
intoxication he found himself drawing deep
breaths of air laughing aloud desiring to shout after
a time that desire became too strong for him and he
shouted

  the machine had now risen as high as was customary
with aeropiles and they began to curve about towards the
south steering graham perceived was effected by the
opening or closing of one or two thin strips of membrane
in one or other of the otherwise rigid wings and by the
movement of the whole engine backward or forward
along its supports the aeronaut set the engine gliding
slowly forward along its rail and opened the valve of the
leeward wing until the stem of the aeropile was hori-
zontal and pointing southward and in that direction
they drove with a slight list to leeward and with a slow
alternation of movement first a short sharp ascent and
then a long downward glide that was very swift and
pleasing during these downward glides the propeller
was inactive altogether these ascents gave graham a
glorious sense of successful effort the descents through
the rarefied air were beyond all experience he wanted
never to leave the upper air again

  for a time he was intent upon the minute details of
the landscape that ran swiftly northward beneath him
its minute clear detail pleased him exceedingly he was
impressed by the ruin of the houses that had once dotted
the country by the vast treeless expanse of country from
which all farms and villages had gone save for crumbling
ruins he had known the thing was so but seeing it so
was an altogether different matter he tried to make
out places he had known within the hollow basin of the
world below but at first he could distinguish no data that
the thames valley was left behind soon however they
were driving over a sharp chalk hill that he recognized
as the guildford hogs back because of the familiar out-
line of the gorge at its eastward end and because of the
ruins of the town that rose steeply on either lip of this
gorge and from that he made out other points leith
hill the sandy wastes of aldershot and so forth the
downs escarpment was set with gigantic slow-moving
wind-wheels save where the broad eadhamite ports-
mouth road thickly dotted with rushing shapes followed
the course of the old railway the gorge of the wey was
choked with thickets

  the whole expanse of the downs escarpment so far
as the grey haze permitted him to see was set with wind-
wheels to which the largest of the city was but a younger
brother they stirred with a stately motion before the
south-west wind and here and there were patches dotted
with the sheep of the british food trust and here and
there a mounted shepherd made a spot of black then
rushing under the stern of the aeropile came the wealden
heights the line of hindhead pitch hill and leith hill
with a second row of wind-wheels that seemed striving
to rob the downland whirlers of their share of breeze
the purple heather was speckled with yellow gorse and
on the further side a drove of black oxen stampeded be-
fore a couple of mounted men swiftly these swept be-
hind and dwindled and lost color and became scarce mov-
ing specks that were swallowed up in haze

  and when these had vanished in the distance graham
heard a peewit wailing close at hand he perceived he
was now above the south downs and staring over his
shoulder saw the battlements of portsmouth landing
stage towering over the ridge of portsdown hill in
another moment there came into sight a spread of ship-
ping like floating cities the little white cliffs of the
needles dwarfed and sunlit and the grey and glittering
waters of the narrow sea they seemed to leap the
solent in a moment and in a few seconds the isle of
when the sleeper wakes



wight was running past and then beneath him spread
a wider and wider extent of sea here purple with the
shadow of a cloud here grey here a burnished mirror
and here a spread of cloudy greenish blue the isle of
wight grew smaller and smaller in a few more minutes
a strip of grey haze detached itself from other strips
that were clouds descended out of the sky and became a
coastline-sunlit and pleasant-the coast of northern
france it rose it took color became definite and de-
tailed and the counterpart of the downland of england
was speeding by below

  in a little time as it seemed paris came above the
horizon and hung there for a space and sank out of
sight again as the aeroplane circled about to the north
again but he perceived the eiffel tower still standing
and beside it a huge dome surmounted by a pin-point
colossus and he perceived too though he did not un-
derstand it at the time a slanting drift of smoke the
aeronaut said something about trouble in the under-
ways that graham did not heed at the time but he
marked the minarets and towers and slender masses that
streamed skyward above the city wind-vanes and knew
that in the matter of grace at least paris still kept in
front of her larger rival and even as he looked a pale
blue shape ascended very swiftly from the city like a
dead leaf driving up before a gale it curved round and
soared towards them growing rapidly larger and larger
the aeronaut was saying something what said
graham loth to take his eyes from this aeroplane
sire bawled the aeronaut pointing

  they rose and curved about northward as it drew
nearer nearer it came and nearer larger and larger
the throb throb throb-beat of the aeropiles flight
that had seemed so potent and swift suddenly appeared
slow by comparison with this tremendous rush how
great the monster seemed how swift and ready it
passed quite closely beneath them driving along silently
a vast spread of wire-netting translucent wings a thing
alive graham had a momentary glimpse of the rows and
rows of wrapped-up passengers slung in their little
cradles behind wind-screens of a white-clothed engineer
crawling against the gale along a ladder way of spouting
engines beating together of the whirling wind screw
and of a wide waste of wing he exulted in the sight
and in an instant the thing had passed

  it rose slightly and their own little wings swayed in the
rush of its flight it fell and grew smaller scarcely
had they moved as it seemed before it was again only
a flat blue thing that dwindled in the sky this was the
aeroplane that went to and fro between london and
paris in fair weather and in peaceful times it came and
went four times a day

  they beat across the channel slowly as it seemed now
to grahams enlarged ideas and beachy head rose
greyly to the left of them

  land called the aeronaut his voice small against the
whistling of the air over the wind-screen

  not yet bawled graham laughing not land yet i
want to learn more of this machine

  i meant- said the aeronaut

  i want to learn more of this machine repeated
graham

  im coming to you he said and had flung himself
free of his chair and taken a step along the guarded rail
between them he stopped for a moment and his color
changed and his hands tightened another step and he
was clinging close to the aeronaut he felt a weight on
his shoulder the pressure of the air his hat was a
whirling speck behind the wind came in gusts over his
wind-screen and blew his hair in streamers past his cheek
the aeronaut made some hasty adjustments for the
shifting of the centres of gravity and pressure

  i want to have these things explained said graham
what do you do when you move that engine forward

  the aeronaut hesitated then he answered they are
complex sire

  i dont mind shouted graham i dont mind
there was a moments pause aeronautics is the se-
cret-the privilege-

  i know but im the master and i mean to know
he laughed full of this novel realization of power that
was his gift from the upper air

  the aeropile curved about and the keen fresh wind
cut across grahams face and his garment lugged at his
body as the stem pointed round to the west the two
men looked into each others eyes

  sire there are rules-

  not where i am concerned said graham you seem
to forget

  the aeronaut scrutinized his face no he said i
do not forget sire but in all the earth-no man who is
not a sworn aeronaut-has ever a chance they come as
passengers-

  i have heard something of the sort but im not
going to argue these points do you know why i have
slept two hundred years to fly

  sire said the aeronaut the rules-if i break the
rules-

  graham waved the penalties aside

  then if you will watch me-

  no said graham swaying and gripping tight as the
machine lifted its nose again for an ascent thats not
my game i want to do it myself do it myself if i
smash for it no i will see i am going to clamber
by this-to come and share your seat steady i mean
to fly of my own accord if i smash at the end of it i
will have something to pay for my sleep of all other
things- in my past it was my dream to fly now-
keep your balance

  a dozen spies are watching me sire

  grahams temper was at an end perhaps he chose it
should be he swore he swung himself round the
intervening mass of levers and the aeropile swayed

  am i master of the earth he said or is your
society no take your hands off those levers and
hold my wrists yes-so and now how do we turn
her nose down to the glide

  sire said the aeronaut

  what is it

  you will protect me

  lord yes if i have to burn london now

  and with that promise graham bought his first lesson
in aerial navigation its clearly to your advantage
this journey he said with a loud laugh-for the air
was like strong wine-to teach me quickly and well do
i pull this ah so hullo

  back sire back

 back-right one-two-three-good god ah
up she goes but this is living

  and now the machine began to dance the strangest
figures in the air now it would sweep round a spiral of
scarcely a hundred yards in diameter now it would rush
up into the air and swoop down again steeply swiftly
falling like a hawk to recover in a rushing loop that
swept it high again in one of these descents it seemed
driving straight at the drifting park of balloons in the
southeast and only curved about and cleared them by
a sudden recovery of dexterity the extraordinary swift-
ness and smoothness of the motion the extraordinary
effect of the rarefied air upon his constitution threw
graham into a careless fury

  but at last a queer incident came to sober him to
send him flying down once more to the crowded life
below with all its dark insoluble riddles as he swooped
came a tap and something flying past and a drop like a
drop of rain then as he went on down he saw some-
thing like a white rag whirling down in his wake what
was that he asked i did not see


amazing stories quarterly

  the aeronaut glanced and then clutched at the lever
to recover for they were sweeping down when the
aeropile was rising again he drew a deep breath and
replied that and he indicated the white thing still
fluttering down was a swan

   never saw it said graham

  the aeronaut made no answer and graham saw little
drops upon his forehead

  they drove horizontally while graham clambered back
to the passengers place out of the lash of the wind
and then came a swift rush down with the wind-screw
whirling to check their fall and the flying stage growing
broad and dark before them the sun sinking over the
chalk hills in the west fell with them and left the sky a
blaze of gold

  soon men could be seen as little specks he heard a
noise coming up to meet him a noise like the sound of
waves upon a pebbly beach and saw that the roofs about
the flying stage were dark with his people rejoicing over
his safe return a dark mass was crushed together
under the stage a darkness stippled with innumerable
faces and quivering with the minute oscillation of waved
white handkerchiefs and waving hands

chapter xvii

three days

lincoln awaited graham in an apartment beneath
the flying stages he seemed curious to learn all
that had happened pleased to hear of the extraor-
dinary delight and interest which graham took in flying
graham was in a mood of enthusiasm i must learn to
fly he cried i must master that i pity all poor
souls who have died without this opportunity the sweet
swift air it is the most wonderful experience in the
world

  you will find our new times full of wonderful expe-
riences said lincoln i do not know what you will
care to do now we have music that may seem novel
for the present said graham flying holds me let
me learn more of that your aeronaut was saying there
is some trades union objection to ones learning

  there is i believe said lincoln but for you-
if you would like to occupy yourself with that we can
make you a sworn aeronaut tomorrow

  graham expressed his wishes vividly and talked of his
sensations for a while and as for affairs he asked
abruptly how are things going on

  lincoln waved affairs aside ostrog will tell you
that tomorrow he said everything is settling down
the revolution accomplishes itself all over the world
friction is inevitable here and there of course but your
rule is assured you may rest secure with things in
ostrogs hands

  would it be possible for me to be made a sworn
aeronaut as you call it forthwith-before i sleep said
graham pacing then i could be at it the very first
thing tomorrow again 

  it would be possible said lincoln thoughtfully
quite possible indeed it shall be done he laughed
i came prepared to suggest amusements but you have
found one for yourself i will telephone to the aeronauti-
cal offices from here and we will return to your apart-
ments in the wind-vane control by the time you have
dined the aeronauts will be able to come you dont think
that after you have dined you might prefer- he
paused

  yes said graham

  we have prepared a show of dancers-they have been
brought from the capri theatre

  i hate ballets said graham shortly always did
that other- thats not what i want to see we had
dancers in the old days for the matter of that they
had them in ancient egypt but flying-

  true said lincoln though our dancers-

  they can afford to wait said graham they can
afford to wait i know im not a latin theres
questions i want to ask some expert-about your machin-
ery im keen i want no distractions

  you have the world to choose from said lincoln
whatever you want is yours

  asano appeared and under the escort of a strong
guard they returned through the city streets to gra-
hams apartments far larger crowds had assembled to
witness his return than his departure had gathered and
the shouts and cheering of these masses of people some-
times drowned lincolns answers to the endless questions
grahams aerial journey had suggested at first graham
had acknowledged the cheering and cries of the crowd by
bows and gestures but lincoln warned him that such a
recognition would be considered incorrect behavior gra-
ham already a little wearied by rhythmic civilities ig-
nored his subjects for the remainder of his public prog-
ress

  directly they arrived at his apartments asano de-
parted in search of kinematographic renderings of mach-
inery in motion and lincoln despatched grahams com-
mands for models of machines and small machines to il-
lustrate the various mechanical advances of the last two
centuries the little group of appliances for telegraphic
communication attracted the master so strongly that his
delightfully prepared dinner served by a number of
charmingly dexterous girls waited for a space the
habit of smoking had almost ceased from the face of the
earth but when he expressed a wish for that indulgence
inquiries were made and some excellent cigars were dis-
covered in florida and sent to him by pneumatic des-
patch while the dinner was still in progress after-
wards came the aeronauts and a feast of ingenious won-
ders in the hands of a latter-day engineer for the time
at any rate the neat dexterity of counting and number-
ing machines building machines spinning engines patent
doorways explosive motors grain and water elevators
slaughter-house machines and harvesting appliances was
more fascinating to graham than any bayadere we
were savages was his refrain we were savages we
were in the stone age-compared with this and what
else have you

  there came also practical psychologists with some
very interesting developments in the art of hypnotism
the names of milne bramwell fechner liebault william
james myers and gurney he found bore a value now
that would have astonished their contemporaries sev-
eral practical applications of psychology were now in gen-
eral use it had largely superseded drugs antiseptics and
anaesthetics in medicine was employed by almost all who
had any need of mental concentration a real enlarge-
ment of human faculty seemed to have been effected in
this direction the feats of calculating boys the won-
ders as graham had been wont to regard them of mes-
merizes were now within the range of anyone who
could afford the services of a skilled hypnotist long
ago the old examination methods in education had been
destroyed by these expedients instead of years of study
candidates had substituted a few -eeks of trances and
during the trances expert coaches had simply to repeat
all the points necessary for adequate answering adding
a suggestion of the post hypnotic recollection of these
points in process mathematics particularly this sid had
been of singular service and it was now invariably in-
voked by such players of chess and games of manual
dexterity as were still to be found in fact all operations
conducted under finite rules of a quasi-mechanical sort
that is were now systematically relieved from the wan-
derings of imagination and emotion and brought to an
unexampled pitch of accuracy little children of the
laboring classes so soon as they were of sufficient age
to be hypnotized were thus converted into beautifully
when the sleeper wakes



punctual and trustworthy machine minders and released
forthwith from the long long thoughts of youth aero-
nautical pupils who gave way to giddiness could be re-
lieved from their imaginary terrors in every street
were hypnotists ready to print permanent memories upon
the mind if anyone desired to remember a name a series
of numbers a song or a speech it could be done by this
method and conversely memories could be effaced habits
removed and desires eradicated-a sort of psychic sur-
gery was in fact in general use indignities humbling
experiences were thus forgotten amorous widows would
obliterate their previous husbands angry lovers release
themselves from their slavery to graft desires how-
ever was still impossible and the facts of thought trans-
ference were yet unsystematized the psychologists il-
lustrated their expositions with some astounding experi-
ments in mnemonics made through the agency of a troupe
of pale-faced children in blue

  graham like most of the people of his former time
distrusted the hypnotist or he might then and there have
eased his mind of many painful preoccupations but in
spite of lincolns assurances he held to the old theory
that to be hypnotized was in some way the surrender of
his personality the abdication of his will at the ban-
quet of wonderful experiences that were beginning he
wanted very keenly to remain absolutely himself

the next day and another day and yet another day
passed in such interests as these each day graham
spent many hours in the glorious entertainment of lying
on the third day he soared across middle france and
within sight of the snow-clad alps these vigorous
exercises gave him restful sleep and each day saw a
great stride in his health from the spiritless anaemia of
his first awakening and whenever he was not in the
air and awake lincoln was assiduous in the cause of his
amusement all that was novel and curious in contempo-
rary invention was brought to him until at last his
appetite for novelty was well-nigh glutted one might
fill a dozen inconsecutive volumes with the strange things
they exhibited each afternoon he held his court for an
hour or so he speedily found his interest in his contem-
poraries becoming personal and intimate at first he had
been alert chiefly for unfamiliarity and peculiarity any
floppishness in their dress any discordance with his pre-
conceptions of nobility in their status and manners had
jarred upon him and it was remarkable to him how soon
that strangeness and the faint hostility that arose from
it disappeared how soon he came to appreciate the true
perspective of his position and see the old victorian days
remote and quaint he found himself particularly amused
by the red-haired daughter of the manager of the euro-
pean piggeries on the second day after dinner he made
the acquaintance of a latter-day dancing girl and found
her an astonishing artist and after that more hypnotic
wonders on the third day lincoln was moved to sug-
gest that the master should repair to a pleasure city
but this graham declined nor would he accept the services
of the hypnotists in his aeronautical experiments the
link of locality held him to london he found a perpetual
wonder in topographical identifications that he would
have missed abroad here-or a hundred feet below
here he could say i used to eat my midday cutlets
during my london university days underneath here
was waterloo and the perpetual hunt for confusing trains
often have i stood waiting down there bag in hand and
stared up into the sky above the forest of signals little
thinking i should walk some day a hundred yards in the
air and now in that very sky that was once a grey
smoke canopy i circle in an aeropile

  during those three days graham was so occupied with
such distractions that the vast political movements in
progress outside his quarters had but a small share of
his attention those about him told him little daily

came ostrog the boss his grand visier his mayor of
the palace to report in vague terms the steady establish-
ment of his rule a little trouble soon to be settled in
this city a slight disturbance in that the song of the
social revolt came to him no more he never learned that
it had been forbidden in the municipal limits and all
the great emotions of the crows nest slumbered in his
mind

  but on the second and third of the three days he found
himself in spite of his interest in the daughter of the
pig manager or it may be by reason of the thoughts her
conversation suggested remembering the girl helen wot-
ton who had spoken to him so oddly at the wind-vane
keepers gathering the impression she had made was a
deep one albeit the incessant surprise of novel circum-
stances had kept him from brooding upon it for a space
but now her memory was coming to its own he won-
dered what she had meant by those broken half-forgotten
sentences the picture of her eyes and the earnest passion
of her face became more vivid as his mechanical inter-
ests faded her beauty came compellingly between him
and certain immediate temptations of ignoble passion
but he did not see her again until three full days were
past

chapter xviii

graham remembers

she came upon him at last in a little gallery that
ran from the wind-vane offices toward his state
apartments the gallery was long and narrow with
a series of recesses each with an arched fenestration that
looked upon a court of palms he came upon her sud-
denly in one of these recesses she was seated she
turned her head at the sound of his footsteps and started
at the sight of him every touch of color vanished from
her face she rose instantly made a step toward him as
if to address him and hesitated he stopped and stood
still expectant then he perceived that a nervous tumult
silenced her perceived too that she must have sought
speech with him to be waiting for him in this place

  he felt a regal impulse to assist her i have wanted
to see you he said a few days ago you wanted to
tell me something-you wanted to tell me of the people
what was it you had to tell me

  she looked at him with troubled eyes

  you said the people were unhappy

  for a moment she was silent still

  it must have seemed strange to you she said
abruptly
it did and yet-

  it was an impulse

  well

  that is all

  she looked at him with a face of hesitation she
spoke with an effort you forget she said drawing a
deep breath

  what

  the people-

  do you mean-

  you forget the people

  he looked interrogative

  yes i know you are surprised for you do not
understand what you are you do not know the things
that are happening

  well

  you do not understand

  not clearly perhaps but-tell me

  she turned to him with sudden resolution it is so
hard to explain i have meant to i have wanted to
and now-i cannot i am not ready with words but
about you-there is something it is wonder your
sleep-your awakening these things are miracles to
me at least-and to all the common people you vho


amazing stories quarterly

lived and suffered and died you who were a common
citizen wake again live again to find yourself master
almost of the earth

  master of the earth he said so they tell me but
try and imagine how little i know of it 

  cities-trusts-the labor company-
principalities powers dominions-the power and the
glory yes i have heard them shout i know i am
master king if you wish with ostrog the boss-
he paused

  she turned upon him and surveyed his face with a
curious scrutiny well

  he smiled to take the responsibility

  that is what we have begun to fear for a moment
she said no more no she said slowly you will
take the responsibility you will take the responsibility
the people look to you

  she spoke softly listen for at least half the years
of your sleep-in every generation-multitudes of people
in every generation greater multitudes of people have
prayed that you might awake-prayed

  graham moved to speak and did not

  she hesitated and a faint color crept back to her
cheek do you know that you have been to myriads-
king arthur barbarossa-the king who would come in
his own good time and put the world right for them

  i suppose the imagination of the people-

  have you not heard our proverb when the sleeper
wakes while you lay insensible and motionless there-
thousands came thousands every first of the month
you lay in state with a white robe upon you and the
people filed by you when i was a little girl i saw you
like that with your face white and calm

  she turned her face from him and looked steadfastly
at the painted wall before her her voice fell when
i was a little girl i used to look at your face  it seemed
to me fixed and waiting like the patience of god

  that is what we thought of you she said that is
how you seemed to us

  she turned shining eyes to him her voice was clear
and strong in the city in the earth a myriad myriad
men and women are waiting to see what you will do
full of strange incredible expectations

  yes

  ostrog-no one-can take that responsibility
graham looked at her in surprise at her face lit with
emotion she seemed at first to have spoken with an
effort and to have fired herself by speaking

  do you think she said that you who have lived
that little life so far away in the past you who have
fallen into and risen out of this miracle of sleep-do you
think that the wonder and reverence and hope of half the
world has gathered about you only that you may live
another little life    that you may shift the responsi-
bility to any other man

  i know how great this kingship of mine is he said
haltingly i know how great it seems but is it real
it is incredible-dreamlike is it real or is it only a
great delusion

  it is real she said if you dare

  after all like all kingship my kingship is belief it
is an illusion in the minds of men

  if you dare she said

 but-

  countless men she said and while it is in their
minds-they will obey

  but i know nothing that is what i had in mind i
know nothing and these others-the councillors ostrog
they are wiser cooler they know so much every detail
and indeed what are these miseries of which you
speak what am i to know do you mean-

  he stopped blankly

  i am still hardly more than a girl she said but
to me the world seems full of wretchedness the world

has altered since your day altered very strangely i
have prayed that i might see you and tell you these
things the world has changed as if a canker had
seized it-and robbed life of-everything worth having

she turned a flushed face upon him moving suddenly
your days were the days of freedom yes-i have
thought i have been made to think for my life-has not
been happy men are no longer free-no greater no
better than the men of your time that is not all this
city-is a prison every city now is a prison mammon
grips the key in his hand myriads countless myriads
toil from the cradle to the grave is that right is that
to be-for ever yes far worse than in your time all
about us beneath us sorrow and pain all the shallow
delight of such life as you find about you is separated by
just a little from a life of wretchedness beyond any
telling yes the poor know it-they know they suffer
these countless multitudes who faced death for you two
nights since- you owe your life to them

  yes said graham slowly yes i owe my life to
them

  you come she said from the days when this new
tyranny of the cities was scarcely beginning it is a
tyranny-a tyranny in your days the feudal war lords
had gone and the new lordship of wealth had still to
come half the men in the world still lived out upon
the free countryside the cities had still to devour them
i have heard the stories out of the old books-there was
nobility common men led lives of love and faithfulness
then-they did a thousand things and you-you come
from that time

  it was not- but never mind how is it now-
gain and the pleasure cities or slavery - un-
thanked unhonored slavery

  slavery he said

  slavery

  you dont mean to say that human beings are chat-
tels

  worse that is what i want you to know what i
want you to see i know you do not know they will
keep things from you they will take you presently to a
pleasure city but you have noticed men and women
and children in pale blue canvas with thin yellow faces
and dull eyes

  everywhere

  speaking a horrible dialect coarse and weak

  i have heard it

  they are the slaves-your slaves they are the slaves
of the labor company you own

  the labor company in some way-that is familiar
ah now i remember i saw it when i was wandering
about the city after the lights returned great fronts of
buildings colored pale blue do you really mean-
yes how can i explain it to you of course the
blue uniform struck you nearly a third of our people
wear it-more assume it now every day this labor
company has grown imperceptibly

  what is this labor company asked graham

  in the old times how did you manage with starving
people

  there was the workhouse-which the parishes main-
tained

  workhouse yes-there was something in our
history lessons i remember now the labor company
ousted the workhouse it grew-partly-out of some-
thing-you perhaps may remember it-an emotional
religious organization called the salvation army-that
became a business company in the first place it was
almost a charity to save people from workhouse rigors
now i come to think of it it was one of the earliest
properties your trustees acquired they bought the
salvation army and reconstructed it as this the idea
when the sleeper wakes



in the first place was to give work to starving homeless
people

  yes

  nowadays there are no workhouses no refuges and
charities nothing but that company its offices are
everywhere that blue is its color and any man
woman or child who comes to be hungry and weary and
with neither home nor friend nor resort must go to the
company in the end-or seek some way of death the
euthanasy is beyond their means-for the poor there is
no easy death and at any hour in the day or night
there is food shelter and a blue uniform for all comers
-that is the first condition of the companys incorpo-
ration-and in return for a days shelter the company
extracts a days work and then returns the visitors
proper clothing and sends him or her out again

  yes

  perhaps that does not seem so terrible to you in
your days men starved in your streets that was bad
but they died-men these people in blue- the prov-
erb runs blue canvas once and ever the company
trades in their labor and it has taken care to assure itself
of the supply people come to it starving and helpless
-they eat and sleep for a night and day they work for
a day and at the end of the day they go out again if
they have worked well they have a penny or so-enough
for a theatre or a cheap dancing place or a kinemato-
graph story or a dinner or a bet they wander about
after that is spent begging is prevented by the police
of the ways besides no one gives they come back
again the next day or the day after-brought back
by the same incapacity that brought them first at last
their proper clothing wears out or their rags get so
shabby that they are ashamed then they must work
for months to get fresh if they want fresh a great
number of children are born under the companys care
the mother owes them a month thereafter-the children
they cherish and educate until they are fourteen and
they pay two years service you may be sure these
children are educated for the blue canvas and so it is
the company works

  and none are destitute in the city

  none they are either in blue canvas or in prison
  if they will not work

  most people will work at that pitch and the com-
pany has powers there are stages of unpleasantness
in the work-stoppage of food-and a man or woman
who has refused to work once is known by a thumb-
marking system in the companys offices all over the
world besides who can leave the city poor to go to
paris costs two lions and for insubordination there are
the prisons-dark and miserable-out of sight below
there are prisons now for many things

  and a third of the people wear this blue canvas
more than a third toilers living without pride or
delight and hope with the stories of pleasure cities
ringing in their ears mocking their shameful lives their
privations and hardships too poor even for the euthan-
asy the rich mans refuge from life dumb crippled
millions countless millions all the world about ignorant
of anything but limitations and unsatisfied desires they
are born they are thwarted and they die that is the
state to which we have come

  for a space graham sat downcast

  but there has been a revolution he said all these
things will be changed ostrog-

  that is our hope that is the hope of the world
but ostrog will not do it he is a politician to him
it seems things must be like this he does not mind
he takes it for granted all the rich all the influen-
tial all who are happy come at last to take these mis-
eries for granted they use the people in their politics

they live in ease by their degradation but you-you
who come from a happier age-it is to you the people
look to you

  he looked at her face her eyes were bright with
unshed tears he felt a rush of emotion for a moment
he forgot this city he forgot the race and all those
vague remote voices in the immediate humanity of her
beauty

  but what am i to do he said with his eyes upon
her

  rule she answered bending towards him and speak-
ing in a low tone rule the world as it has never been
ruled for the good and happiness of men for you might
rule it-you could rule it

  the people are stirring all over the world the people
are stirring it wants but a word-but a word from you
-to bring them all together even the middle sort of
people are restless-unhappy

  they are not telling you the things that are happen-
ing the people will not go back to their drudgery-they
refuse to be disarmed ostrog has awakened something
greater than he dreamt of-he has awakened hopes

  his heart was beating fast he tried to seem judi-
cial to weigh considerations

  they only want their leader she said

  and then

you could do what you would-the world is yours
he sat no longer regarding her presently he spoke
the old dreams and the thing i have dreamt liberty
happiness are they dreams could one man-one man
- his voice sank and ceased

  not one man but all men-give them only a leader
to speak the desire of their hearts

  he shook his head and for a time there was silence
he looked up suddenly and their eyes met i have
not your faith he said i have not your youth i
am here with power that mocks me no-let me speak
i want to do-not right-i have not the strength for
that-but something rather right than wrong it will
bring no millenium but i am resolved now that i will
rule what you have said has awakened me   
you are right ostrog must know his place and
i will learn-   one thing i promise you this labor
slavery shall end

  and you will rule

  yes provided- there is one thing

  yes

  that you will help me

  i-a girl

  yes does it not occur to you i am absolutely alone
she started and for an instant her eyes had pity
need you ask whether i will help you she said

  she stood before him beautiful worshipful and her
enthusiasm and the greatness of their theme was like
a great gulf fixed between them to touch her to clasp
her hand was a thing beyond hope then i will rule
indeed he said slowly i will rule- he paused
with you

  there came a tense silence and then the beating of
a clock striking the hour she made him no answer
graham rose

  even now he said ostrog will be waiting he
hesitated facing her when i have asked him certain
questions- there is much i do not know it may be
that i will go to see with my own eyes the things of
which you have spoken and when i return-

  i shall know of your going and coming i will wait
for you here again

  he stood for a moment regarding her

  i knew she said and stopped

  he waited but she said no more they regarded one
another steadfastly questioningly and then he turned
from her towards the wind-vane office

ostrogs point of view

graham found ostrog waiting to give a formal ac-
count of his days stewardship on previous
occasions he had passed over this ceremony as
speedily as possible in order to resume his aerial experi-
ences but now he began to ask quick short questions he
was very anxious to take up his empire forthwith ostrog
brought flattering reports of the development of affairs
abroad in paris and berlin graham perceived that he
was saying there had been trouble not organized re-
sistance indeed but insubordinate proceedings after
all these years said ostrog when graham pressed in-
quiries the commune has lifted its head again that
is the real nature of the struggle to be explicit but
order had been restored in these cities graham the
more deliberately judicial for the stirring emotions he
felt asked if there had been any fighting a little
said ostrog in one quarter only but the senegalese
division of our african agricultural police-the consoli-
dated african companies have a very well drilled police
-was ready and so were the aeroplanes we expected
a little trouble in the continental cities and in america

but things are very quiet in america they are satis-
fied with the overthrow of the council for the time

  why should you expect trouble asked graham
abruptly

  there is a lot of discontent-social discontent

  the labor company

  you are learning said ostrog with a touch of sur-
prise yes it is chiefly the discontent with the labor
company it was that discontent supplied the motive
force of this overthrow-that and vour awakening

  yes

  ostrog smiled he became explicit we had to stir
up their discontent we had to revive the old ideals of
universal happiness-all men equal-all men happy-no
luxury that everyone may not share-ideas that have
slumbered for two hundred years you know that we
had to revive these ideals impossible as they are-in
order to overthrow the council and now-

  well

  our revolution is accomplished and the council is
overthrown and people whom we have stirred up-re-
main surging there was scarcely enough fighting   
we made promises of course it is extraordinary how
violently and rapidly this vague out-of-date humanita-
rianism has revived and spread we who sowed the seed
when the sleeper wakes



even have been astonished in paris as i say-we have
had to call in a little external help

  and here

  there is trouble multitudes will not go back to
work there is a general strike half the factories
are empty and the people are swarming in the ways
they are talking of a commune men in silk and satin
have been insulted in the streets the blue canvas is
expecting all sorts of things from you    of course
there is no need for you to trouble we are setting the
babble machines to work with counter suggestions in
the cause of law and order we must keep the grip
tight that is all

  graham thought he perceived a way of asserting
himself but he spoke with restraint

  even to the pitch of bringing a negro police he
said

  they are useful said ostrog they are fine loyal
brutes with no wash of ideas in their heads-such as
our rabble has the council should have had them as
police of the ways and things might have been different
of course there is nothing to fear except rioting and
wreckage you can manage your own wings now and
you can soar away to capri if there is any smoke or fuss
we have the pull of all the great things the aeronauts
are privileged and rich the closest trades union in the
world and so are the engineers of the wind vanes we
have the air and the mastery of the air is the mastery
of the earth no one of any ability is organizing against
us they have no leaders-only the sectional leaders of
the secret society we organized before your very oppor-
tune awakening mere busybodies and sentimentalists
they are and bitterly jealous of each other none of them
is man enough for a central figure the only trouble will
be a disorganized upheaval to be frank-that may hap-
pen but it wont interrupt your aeronautics the days
when the people could make revolutions are past

  i suppose they are said graham i suppose they
are he mused this world of yours has been full
of surprises to me in the old days we dreamt of a
wonderful democratic life of a time when all men would
be equal and happy

  ostrog looked at him steadfastly the day of de-
mocracy is past he said past for ever that day
began with the bowmen of crecy it ended when marching
infantry when common men in masses ceased to win
the battles of the world when costly cannon great iron-
clads and strategic railways became the means of power
today is the day of wealth wealth now is power as it
never was power before-it commands earth and sea and
sky all power is for those who can handle wealth   
you must accept facts and these are facts the world
for the crowd the crowd as ruler even in your
days that creed has been tried and condemned today
it has only one believer-a multiplex silly one-the man
in the crowd

  graham did not answer immediately he stood lost
in sombre preoccupations

  no said ostrog the day of the common man is
past on the open countryside one man is as good as
another or nearly as good the earlier aristocracy had
a precarious tenure of strength and audacity they
were tempered-tempered there were insurrections
duels riots the first real aristocracy the first perma-
nent aristocracy came in with castles and armor and
vanished before the musket and bow but this is the
second aristocracy the real one those days of gun-
powder and democracy were only an eddy in the stream
the common man now is a helpless unit in these days
we have this great machine of the city and an organiza-
tion complex beyond his understanding

  yet said graham there is something resists some-
thing you are holding down-something that stirs and
presses

  you will see said ostrog with a forced smile that
would brush these difficult questions aside i have not
roused the force to destroy myself-trust me

  i wonder said graham

  ostrog stared

  must the world go this way said graham with his
emotions at the speaking point must it indeed go in
this way have all our hopes been vain

  what do you mean said ostrog hopes

  i came from a democratic age and i find an aristo-
cratic tyranny

  well-but you are the chief tyrant

  graham shook his head

  well said ostrog take the general question it
is the way that change has always travelled aristoc-
racy the prevalence of the best-the suffering and ex-
tinction of the unfit and so to better things

  but aristocracy those people i met-

  oh not those said ostrog but for the most part
they go to their death vice and pleasure they have
no children that sert of stuff will die out if the
world keeps to one road that is if there is no turning
back an easy road to excess convenient euthanasia for
the pleasure seekers singed in the flame that is the
way to improve the race

 pleasant extinction said graham yet-he
thought for an instant there is that other thing-
the crowd the great mass of poor men will that die
out that will not die out and it suffers its suffering
is a force that even you-

  ostrog moved impatiently and when he spoke he
spoke rather less evenly than before

  dont you trouble about these things he said
everything will be settled in a few days now the
crowd is a huge foolish beast what if it does not die
out even if it does not die it can still be tamed and
driven i have no sympathy with servile men you
heard those people shouting and singing two nights ago
they were taught that song if you had taken any man
there in cold blood and asked why he shouted he could
not have told you they think they are shouting for you
that they are loyal and devoted to you just then they
were ready to slaughter the council today-they are
already murmuring against those who have overthrown
the council

  no no said graham they shouted because their
lives were dreary without joy or pride and because in
me-in me-they hoped

 and what was their hope what is their hope
what right have they to hope they work ill and they
want the reward of those who work well the hope of
mankind-what is it that some day the over-man
may come that some day the inferior the weak and
the bestial may be subdued or eliminated subdued if
not eliminated the world is no place for the bad the
stupid the enervated their duty-its a fine duty tool-
is to die the death of the failure that is the path
by which the beast rose to manhood by which man goe
on to higher things

ostrog took a pace seemed to think and turned on
graham i can imagine how this great world state
of ours seems to a victorian englishman you regret
all the old forms of representative government-their
spectres still haunt the world the voting councils and
parliaments and all that eighteenth century tomfoolery
you feel moved against our pleasure cities i might
have thought of that-had i not been busy but you
will learn better the people are mad with envy-they
would be in sympathy with you even in the streets
now they clamor to destroy the pleasure cities but
the pleasure cities are the excretory organs of the state
attractive places that year after year draw together all
that is weak and vicious all that is lascivious and lazy


amazing stories quarterly

all the easy roguery of the world to a graceful destruc-
tion they go there they have their time they die child-
less all the pretty silly lascivious women die childless
and mankind is the better if the people were sane they
would not envy the rich their way of death and you
would emancipate the silly brainless workers that we
have enslaved and try to make their lives easy and
pleasant again just as they have sunk to what they
are fit for he smiled a smile that irritated graham
oddly you will learn better i know those ideas in
my boyhood i read your shelley and dreamt of liberty
there is no liberty save wisdom and self-control lib-
erty is within-not without it is each mans own affair
suppose - which is impossible - that these swarming
yelping fools in blue get the upper hand of us what then
they will only fall to other masters so long as there
are sheep nature will insist on beasts of prey it would
mean but a few hundred years delay the coming of the
aristocrat is fatal and assured the end will be the
over-man-for all the mad protests of humanity let
them revolt let them win and kill me and my like others
will arise-other masters the end will be the same

  i wonder said graham doggedly

  for a moment he stood downcast

  but i must see these things for myself he said
suddenly assuming a tone of confident mastery only
by seeing can i understand i must learn that is what
i want to tell you ostrog i do not want to be king in
a pleasure city that is not my pleasure i have spent
enough time with aeronautics-and those other things
i must learn how people live now how the common life
has developed then i shall understand these things
better i must learn how common people live-the labor
people more especially-how they work marry bear
children die-

  you get that from our realistic novelists suggested
ostrog suddenly preoccupied

  i want reality said graham not realism

  there are difficulties said ostrog and thought on
the whole perhaps-

  i did not expect-

  i had thought- and yet perhaps- you say you
want to go through the ways of the city and see the
common people

  suddenly he came to some conclusion you would
need to go disguised he said the city is intensely
excited and the discovery of your presence among them
might create a fearful tumult still this wish of yours
to go into this city-this idea of yours- yes now
i think the thing over it seems to me not altogether-
it can be contrived if you would really find an interest
in that you are of course master you can go soon
if you like a disguise for this excursion asano will
be able to manage he would go with you after all it
is not a bad idea of yours

  you will not want to consult me in any matter
asked graham suddenly struck by an odd suspicion

  oh dear no no i think you may trust affairs to
me for a time at any rate said ostrog smiling even
if we differ-

  graham glanced at him sharply

  there is no fighting likely to happen soon he
asked abruptly

  certainly not

  i have been thinking about these negroes i dont
believe the people intend any hostility to me and after
all i am the master i do not want any negroes brought
to london it is an archaic prejudice perhaps but i
have peculiar feelings about europeans and the subject
races even about paris-

  ostrog stood watching him from under his drooping
brows i am not bringing negroes to london he said
slowly but if-

  you are not to bring armed negroes to london what-

ever happens said graham in that matter i am
quite decided

  ostrog after a pause decided not to speak and bowed
deferentially

chapter xx

in the city ways

and that night unknown and unsuspected graham
dressed in the costume of an inferior wind-vane
official keeping holiday and accompanied by asano
in labor company canvas surveyed the city through
which he had wandered when it was veiled in darkness
but now he saw it lit and waking a whirlpool of life
in spite of the surging and swaying of the forces of
revolution in spite of the unusual discontent the mut-
terings of the greater struggle of which the first revolt
was but the prelude the myriad streams of commerce
still flowed wide and strong he knew now something
of the dimensions and quality of the new age but he
was not prepared for the infinite surprise of the detailed
view for the torrent of color and vivid impressions that
poured past him

   this was his first real contact with the people of these
latter days he realized that all that had gone before
saving his glimpses of the public theatres and markets
had had its element of seclusion had been a movement
within the comparatively narrow political quarter that
all his previous experiences had revolved immediately
about the question of his own position but here was
the city at the busiest hours of night the people to a
large extent returned to their own immediate interests
the resumption of the real informal life the common
habits of the new time

  they emerged at first into a street whose opposite
ways were crowded with the blue canvas liveries this
swarm graham saw was a portion of a procession-
it was odd to see a procession parading the city seated
they carried banners of coarse red stuff with red let-
ters no disarmament said the banners for the most
part in crudely daubed letters and with variant spelling
and why should we disarm no disarming no
disarming banner after banner went by a stream of
banners flowing past and at last at the end the song of
the revolt and a noisy band of strange instruments
they all ought to be at work said asano they have
had no food these two days or they have stolen it

  presently asano made a detour to avoid the con-
gested crowd that gaped upon the occasional passage of
dead bodies from hospital to a mortuary the gleanings
after deaths harvest of the first revolt

  that night few people were sleeping everyone was
abroad a vast excitement perpetual crowds perpetu-
ally changing surrounded graham his mind was con-
fused and darkened by an incessant tumult by the cries
and enigmatical fragments of the social struggle that
was as yet only beginning everywhere festoons and
banners of black and strange decorations intensified the
quality of his popularity everywhere he caught snatches
of that crude thick dialect that served the illiterate class
the class that is beyond the reach of phonograph culture
 their common-place intercourse everywhere this
trouble of disarmament was in the air with a quality
of immediate stress of which he had no inkling during
his seclusion in the wind-vane quarter he perceived
that as soon as he returned he must discuss this with
ostrog this and the greater issues of which it was the
expression in a far more conclusive way than he had
so far done perpetually that night even in the earlier
hours of their wanderings about the city the spirit
of unrest and revolt swamped his attention to the ex-
clusion of countless strange things he might otherwise
have observed

this preoccupation made his impressions fragmentary
when the sleeper wakes



yet amidst so much that was strange and vivid no
subject however personal and insistent could exert un-
divided sway there were spaces when the revolution-
ary movement passed clean out of his mind was drawn
aside like a curtain from before some startling new
aspect of the time helen had swayed his mind to this
intense earnestness of inquiry but there came times
when she even receded beyond his conscious thoughts
at one moment for example he found they were travers-
ing the religious quarter for the easy transit about the
city afforded by the moving ways rendered sporadic
churches and chapels no longer necessary-and his at-
tention was vividly arrested by the facade of one of the
christian sects

  they were traveling seated on one of the swift upper
ways the place leapt upon them at a bend and advanced
rapidly towards them it was covered with inscrip-
tions from top to base in vivid white and blue save
where a vast and glaring kinematograph transparency
presented a realistic new testament scene and where a
vast festoon of black to show that the popular religion
followed the popular politics hung across the lettering
graham had already become familiar with the phono-
type writing and these inscriptions arrested him being
to his sense for the most part almost incredible blas-
phemy among the less offensive were salvation on
the first floor and turn to the right put your
money on your maker the sharpest conversion in
london expert operators look slippy what christ
would say to the sleeper-join the up-to-date saints
be a christian-without hindrance to your present oc-
cupation all the brightest bishops on the bench to-
night and prices as usual brisk blessings for busy
business men

  but this is appalling said graham as that deaf-
ening scream of mercantile piety towered above them

   what is appalling asked his little officer apparently
seeking vainly for anything unusual in this shrieking
enamel

  this surely the essence of religion is reverence

  oh that asano looked at graham does it shock
you he said in the tone of one who makes a discovery
i suppose it would of course i had forgotten nowa-
days the competition for attention is so keen and people
simply havent the leisure to attend to their souls you
know as they used to do he smiled in the old days
you had quiet sabbaths and the countryside though
somewhere ive read of sunday afternoons that-

  but that said graham glancing back at the re-
ceding blue and white that is surely not the only-

  there are hundreds of different ways but of
course if a sect doesnt tell it doesnt pay worship
has moved with the times there are high class sects
with quieter ways-costly incense and personal attentions
and all that these people are extremely popular and
prosperous they pay several dozen lions for those apart-
ments to the council-to you i should say

   graham still felt a difficulty with the coinage and this
mention of a dozen lions brought him abruptly to that
matter in a moment the screaming temples and their
swarming touts were forgotten in this new interest a
turn of a phrase suggested and an answer confirmed the
idea that gold and silver were both demonetized that
stamped gold wrhich had begun its reign amidst the mer-
chants of phoenicia was at last dethroned the change
had been graduated but swift brought about by an exten-
sion of the system of cheques that had even in his pre-
vious life already practically superseded gold in all the
larger business transactions the common traffic of the
city the common currency indeed of all the world was
conducted by means of the little brown green and pink
council cheques for small amounts printed with a blank
payee asano had several with him and at the first
opportunity he supplied the gaps in his set they were

printed not on tearable paper but on a semi-transparent
fabric of silken flexibility interwoven with silk acros
them all sprawled a fac-simile of grahams signature his
first encounter with the curves and turns of that famil-
iar autograph for two hundred and three years

some intermediary experiences made no impression
sufficiently vivid to prevent the matter of the dis-
armament claiming his thoughts again a blurred picture
of a theosophist temple that promised miracles
in enormous letters of unsteady fire was least submerged
perhaps but then came the view of the dining hall in
northumberland avenue that interested him very
greatly

  by the energy and thought of asano he was able to
view this place from a little screened gallery reserved
for the attendants of the tables the building was per-
vaded by a distant muffled hooting piping and bawling
of which he did not at first understand the import but
which recalled a certain mysterious leathery voice he
had heard after the resumption of the lights on the night
of his solitary wandering

  he had grown accustomed now to vastness and great
numbers of people nevertheless this spectacle held him
for a long time it was as he watched the table service
more immediately beneath and interspersed with many
questions and answers concerning details that the reali-
zation of the full significance of the feast of several
thousand people came to him

  it was his constant surprise to find that points that
one might have expected to strike vividly at the very
outset never occurred to him until some trivial detail
suddenly shaped as a riddle and pointed to the obvious
thing he had overlooked in this matter for instance
it had not occurred to him that this continuity of the
city this exclusion of weather these vast halls and ways
involved the disappearance of the household that the
typical victorian home the little brick cell containing
kitchen and scullery living rooms and bedrooms had
save for the ruins that diversified the countryside van-
ished as surely as the wattle hut but now he saw what
had indeed been manifest from the first that london
regarded as a living place was no longer an aggregation
of houses but a prodigious hotel an hotel with a thou-
sand classes of accommodation thousands of dining halls
chapels theatres markets and places of assembly a syn-
thesis of enterprises of which he chiefly was the owner
people had their sleeping rooms with it might be ante-
chambers rooms that were always sanitary at least what-
ever the degree of comfort and privacy and for the
rest they lived much as many people had lived in the new-
made giant hotels of the victorian days eating read-
ing thinking playing conversing all in places of public
resort going to their work in the industrial quarters of
the city or doing business in their offices in the trading
section

  he perceived at once how necessarily this state of
affairs had developed from the victorian city the fun-
damental reason for the modern city had ever been the
economy of co-operation the chief thing to prevent
the merging of the separate households in his own gen-
eration was simply the still imperfect civilization of the
people the strong barbaric pride passions and preju-
dices the jealousies rivalries and violence of the middle
and lower classes which had necessitated the entire sep-
aration of contiguous households but the change the
taming of the people had been in rapid progress even
then in his brief thirty years of previous life he had
seen an enormous extension of the habit of consuming
meals from home the casually patronized horse-box
coffee-house had given place to the open and crowded
aerated bread shop for instance womens clubs had had
their beginning and an immense development of reading
rooms lounges and libraries had witnessed to the growth
amazing stories quarterly

of social confidence these promises had by this time
attained to their complete fulfilment the locked and
barred household had passed away

  these people below him belonged he learnt to the
lower middle class the class just above the blue laborers
a class so accustomed in the victorian period to feed with
every precaution of privacy that its members when occa-
sion confronted them with a public meal would usually
hide their embarrassment under horseplay or a markedly
militant demeanor but these gaily if lightly dressed
people below albeit vivacious hurried and uncommuni-
cative were dexterously mannered and certainly quite at
their ease with regard to one another

  he noted a slight significant thing the table as far
as he could see was and remained delightfully neat
there was nothing to parallel the confusion the broad-
cast crumbs the splashes of viand and condiment the
overturned drink and displaced ornaments which would
have marked the stormy progress of the victorian meal
the table furniture was very different there were no
ornaments no flowers and the table was without a cloth
being made he learnt of a solid substance having the
texture and appearance of damask he discerned that
this damask substance was patterned with gracefully
designed trade advertisements

  in a sort of recess before each diner was a complex
apparatus of porcelain and metal there was one plate
of white porcelain and by means of taps for hot and
cold volatile fluids the diner washed this himself be-
tween the courses he also washed his elegant white metal
knife and fork and spoon as occasion required

  soup and the chemical wine that was the common drink
were delivered by similar taps and the remaining
covers traveled automatically in tastefully arranged dishes
down the table along silver rails the diner stopped these
and helped himself at his discretion they appeared
at a little door at one end of the table and vanished at
the other that turn of democratic sentiment in decay
that ugly pride of menial souls which renders equals
loth to wait on one another was very strong he found
among these people he was so preoccupied with these
details that it was only just as he was leaving the place
that he remarked the huge advertisement dioramas that
marched majestically along the upper walls and pro-
claimed the most remarkable commodities

  beyond this place they came into a crowded hall
and he discovered the cause of the noise that had per-
plexed him they paused at a turnstile at which a pay-
ment was made

  grahams attention was immediately arrested by a vio-
lent loud hoot followed by a vast leathery voice the
master is sleeping peacefully it vociferated he is in
excellent health he is going to devote the rest of his
life to aeronautics he says women are more beautiful
than ever galloop wow our wonderful civilization
astonishes him beyond measure beyond all measure
galloop he puts great trust in boss ostrog absolute
confidence in boss ostrog ostrog is to be his chief
minister is authorized to remove or reinstate public
officers-all patronage will be in his hands all patronage
in the hands of boss ostrog the councillors have been
sent back to their own prison above the council house

  graham stopped at the first sentence and looking up
beheld a foolish trumpet face from which this was
brayed this was the general intelligence machine for
a space it seemed to be gathering breath and a regular
throbbing from its cylindrical body was audible then
it trumpeted galloop galloop and broke out again

   paris is now pacified all resistance is over galloop
the black police hold every position of importance in the
city they fought with great bravery singing songs
written in praise of their ancestors by the poet kipling
once or twice they got out of hand and tortured and
mutilated wounded and captured insurgents men and

women moral-dont go rebelling haha galloop
galloop they are lively fellows lively brave fellows
let this be a lesson to the disorderly banderlog of this
city yah banderlog filth of the earth galloop
galloop

  the voice ceased there was a confused murmur of
disapproval among the crowd damned niggers a
man began to harangue near them is this the masters
doing brothers is this the masters doing

  black police said graham what is that you
dont mean-

  asano touched his arm and gave him a warning look
and forthwith another of these mechanisms screaming
deafeningly and gave tongue in a shrill voice yahaha
yahah yap hear a live paper yelp live paper yaha
shocking outrage in paris yahahah the parisians
exasperated by the black police to the pitch of assassina-
tion dreadful reprisals savage times come again
blood blood yaha the nearer babble machine
hooted stupendously galloop galoop drowned the end
of the sentence and proceeded in a rather flatter note
than before with novel comments on the horrors of dis-
order law and order must be maintained said the
nearer babble machine

  but began graham

  dont ask questions here said asano or you will
be involved in an argument

  then let us go on said graham for i want to
know more of this

as he and his companion pushed their way through
the excited crowd that swarmed beneath these
voices toward the exit graham conceived more clearly
the proportion and features of this room altogether
great and small there must have been nearly a thou-
sand of these erections piping hooting bawling and
gabbling in that great space each with its crowd of
excited listeners the majority of them men dressed in
blue canvas there were all sizes of machines from the
little gossipping mechanisms that chuckled out mechani-
cal sarcasm in odd corners through a number of grades
to such fifty-foot giants as that which had first hooted
over graham

  this place was unusually crowded because of the
intense public interest in the course of affairs in paris
evidently the struggle had been much more savage than
ostrog had represented it all the mechanisms were
discoursing upon that topic and the repetition of the
people made the huge hive buzz with such phrases as
lynched policemen women burnt alive fuzzv
wuzzy but does the master allow such things asked
a mannear him is this the beginning of the masters
rule

  is this the beginning of the masters rule for a
long time after he had left the place the hooting whist-
ling and braying of the machines pursued him galloop
galloop yahahah yaha yap yaha is this the
beginning of the masters rule

  directly they were out upon the ways he began to
question asano closely on the nature of the parisian
struggle this disarmament what was their trouble
what does it all mean asano seemed chiefly anxious
to reassure him that it was all right but these out-
rages  you cannot have an omelet said asano with-
out breaking eggs it is only the rough people only in
one part of the city all the rest is all right the
parisian laborers are the wildest in the world except
ours

  what the londoners

  no the japanese they have to be kept in order

  but burning women alive

  a commune said asano they would rob you
of your property they would do away with property
and give the world over to mob rule you are master
when the sleeper wakes



the world is yours but there will be no commune here
there is no need for black police here

  and every consideration has been shown it is their
own negroes-french speaking negroes senegal regi-
ments and niger and timbuctoo

  regiments said graham i thought there was
only one-

  no said asano and glanced at him there is more
than one

  graham felt unpleasantly helpless

  i did not think he began and stopped abruptly he
went off at a tangent to ask for information about these
babble machines for the most part the crowd present
had been shabbily or even raggedly dressed and graham
learnt that so far as the more prosperous classes were
concerned in all the more comfortable private apartments
of the city were fixed babble machines that would speak
directly a lever was pulled the tenant of the apartment
could connect this with the cables of any of the great
news syndicates that he preferred when he learnt
this presently he demanded the reason of their absence
from his own suite of apartments asano stared i
never thought he said ostrog must have had them
removed

  graham started how was i to know he exclaimed

  perhaps he thought they would annoy you said
asano

  they must be replaced directly i return said
graham after an interval

  he found a difficulty in understanding that this news
room and the dining hall were not great central places
that such establishments were repeated almost beyond
counting all over the city but ever and again during
the nights expedition his ears in some new quarter
would pick out from the tumult of the ways the peculiar
hooting of the organ of boss ostrog galloop galloop
or the shrill yahaha yaha yap-hear a live paper
yelp of its chief rival

  repeated too everywhere were such creches as the
one he now entered it was reached by a lift and by a
glass bridge that flung across the dining hall and trav-
ersed the ways at a slight upward angle to enter the
first section of the place necessitated the use of his solvent
signature under asanos direction they were immedi-
ately attended to by a man in a violet robe and gold
clasp the insignia of practising medical men he per-
ceived from this mans manner that his identity was
known and proceeded to ask questions on the strange ar-
rangements of the place without reserve

  on either side of the passage which was silent and

the general intelligence tnachioc

padded as if to deaden the footfall were narrow little
doors their size and arrangement suggestive of the cells
of a victorian prison but the upper portion of each
door was of the same greenish transparent stuff that had
enclosed him at his awakening and within dimly seen
lay in every case a very young baby in a little nest of
wadding elaborate apparatus watched the atmosphere
and rang a bell far away in the central office at the slight-
est departure from the optimum of temperature and
moisture a system of such creches had almost entirely
replaced the hazardous adventures of the old-world nurs-
ing the attendant presently called grahams attention
to the wet nurses a vista of mechanical figures with
arms shoulders and breasts of astonishingly realistic
modeling articulation and texture but mere brass tri-
pods below and having in place of features a flat disc
bearing advertisements likely to be of interest to mothers

  of all the strange things that graham came upon that
night none jarred more upon his habits of thought than
this place the spectacle of the little pink creatures
their feeble limbs swaying uncertainly in vague first
movements left alone without embrace or endearment
was wholly repugnant to him the attendant doctor was
of a different opinion his statistical evidence showed
beyond dispute that in the victorian times the most
dangerous passage of life was the arms of the mother
that there human mortality had ever been most terrible
on the other hand this creche company the international
creche syndicate lost not one-half per cent of the million
babies or so that formed its peculiar care but grahams
prejudice was too strong even for those figures

  along one of the many passages of the place they
presently came upon a young couple in the usual blue
canvas peering through the transparency and laughing
hysterically at the bald head of their first-born gra-
hams face must have showed his estimate of them for
their merriment ceased and they looked abashed but
this little incident accentuated his sudden realization of
the gulf between his habits of thought and the ways of
the new age he passed on to the crawling rooms and
the kindergarten perplexed and distressed he found
the endless long playrooms were empty the latter-day
children at least still spent their nights in sleep as
they went through these the little officer pointed out the
nature of the toys developments of those devised by that
inspired sentimentalist froebel there were nurses
here but much was done by machines that sang and
danced and dangled

  graham was still not clear upon many points but
so many orphans he said perplexed reverting to a first
misconception and learnt again that they were not
orphans

  so soon as thev had left the creche he began to speak
of the horror the babies in their incubating cases had
caused him is motherhood gone he said was it a
cant surely it was an instinct this seems so unnat-
ural-abominable almost

  along here we shall come to the dancing place said
asano by way of reply it is sure to be crowded in
spite of all the political unrest it will be crowded the
women take no great interest in politics-except a few
here and there you will see the mothers-most young
women in london are mothers in that class it is con-
sidered a creditable thing to have one child-a proof of
animation few middle class people have more than one
with the labor company it is different as for mother-
hood they still take an immense pride in the children
they come here to look at them quite often

  then do you mean that the population of the world

v

  is falling yes except among the people under
the labor company they are reckless-

  the air was suddenly dancing with music and down
a way they approached obliquely set with gorgeous pil-

lars as it seemed of clear amethyst flowed a concourse of
gay people and a tumult of merry cries and laughter
he saw curled heads wreathed brows and a happy intri-
cate flutter of gamboge pass triumphant across the pic-
ture

  you will see said asano with a faint smile the
world has changed in a moment you will see the mothers
of the new age come this way we shall see those
yonder again very soon

  they ascended a certain height in a swift lift and
changed to a slower one as they went on the music
grew upon them until it was near and full and splen-
did and moving with its glorious intricacies they could
distinguish the beat of innumerable dancing feet they
made a payment at a turnstile and emerged upon the
wide gallery that overlooked the dancing place and upon
the full enchantment of sound and sight

  here said asano are the fathers and mothers of
the little ones you saw

  the hall was not so richly decorated as that of the
atlas but saving that it was for its size the most
splendid graham had seen the beautiful white-limbed
figures that supported the galleries reminded him once
more of the restored magnificence of sculpture they
seemed to writhe in engaging attitudes their faces
laughed the source of the music that filled the place
was hidden and the whole vast shining floor was thick
with dancing couples look at them said the little
officer see how much they show of motherhood

the gallery they stood upon ran along the upper edge
of a huge screen that cut the dancing hall on the
side from a sort of outer hall that showed through broad
arches the incessant onward rush of the city ways in
this outer hall was a great crowd of less brilliantly
dressed people as numerous almost as those who danced
within the great majority wearing the blue uniform of
the labor company that was now so familiar to graham
too poor to pass the turnstiles to the festival they were
yet unable to keep away from the sound of its seductions
some of them even had cleared spaces and were dancing
also fluttering their rags in the air some shouted as
they danced jests and odd allusions graham did not un-
derstand once someone began whistling the refrain of
the revolutionary song but it seemed as though that
beginning was promptly suppressed the corner was
dark and graham could not see he turned to the hall
again above the caryatid were marble busts of men
whom that age esteemed great moral emancipators and
pioneers for the most part their names were strange to
graham though he recognized grant allen le gallienne
nietzsche shelley and goodwin great black festoons
and eloquent sentiments reinforced the huge inscription
that partially defaced the upper end of the dancing place
and asserted that the festival of the awakening was
in progress

  myriads are taking holiday or staying from work
because of that quite apart from the laborers who
refuse to go back said asano these people are al-
ways ready for holidays

  graham walked to the parapet and stood leaning over
looking down at the dancers save for two or three
remote whispering couples who had stolen apart he and
his guide had the gallery to themselves a warm breath
of scent and vitality came up to him both men and
women below were lightly clad bare-armed open-necked
as the universal warmth of the city permitted the hair
of the men was often a mass of effeminate curls their
chins were always shaven and many of them had flushed
or colored cheeks many of the women were very pretty
and all were dressed with elaborate coquetry as they
swept by beneath he saw ecstatic faces with eyes half
closed in pleasure

  what sort of people are these he asked abruptly
when the sleeper wakes



  workers-prosperous workers what you would have
called the middle class independent tradesmen with
little separate businesses have vanished long ago but
there are store servers managers engineers of a hundred
sorts tonight is a holiday of course and every dancing
place in the city will be crowded and every place of
worship

  but-the women

  the same theres a thousand forms of work for
women now but you had the beginning of the inde-
pendent working-woman in your days most women are
independent now most of these are married more or
less-there are a number of methods of contract-and
that gives them more money and enables them to enjoy
themselves

  i see said graham looking at the flushed faces the
flash and swirl of movement and still thinking of that
nightmare of pink helpless limbs and these are-
mothers

  most of them

  the more i see of these things the more complex i
find your problems this for instance is a surprise
that news from paris was a surprise

  in a little while he spoke again

  these are mothers presently i suppose i shall
get into the modern way of seeing things i have old
habits of mind clinging about me-habits based i sup-
pose on needs that are over and done with of course
in our time a woman was supposed not only to bear chil-
dren but to cherish them to devote herself to them
to educate them-all the essentials of moral and mental
education a child owed its mother or went without
quite a number i admit went without nowadays
clearly there is no more need for such care than if they
were butterflies i see that only there was an ideal-
that figure of a grave patient woman silently and serene-
ly mistress of a home mother and maker of men-to love
her was a sort of worship-

  he stopped and repeated a sort of worship

  ideals change said the little man as needs change
graham awoke from an instant reverie and asano re-
peated his words grahams mind returned to the thing
at hand

  of course i see the perfect reasonableness of this
restraint soberness the matured thought the unselfish
act they are necessities of the barbarous state the life of
dangers dourness is mans tribute to unconquered
nature but man has conquered nature now for all prac-
tical purposes-his political affairs are managed by
bosses with a black police-and life is joyous

  he looked at the dancers again joyous he said
there are weary moments said the little officer re-
flectively

  they all look young down there i should be visibly
the oldest man and in my own time i should have passed
as middle-aged

  they are young there are few old people in this
class in the work cities

  how is that

  old peoples lives are not so pleasant as they used to
be unless they arc rich to hire lovers and helpers and
we have an institution called euthanasy

  ah that euthanasy said graham the easy
death

  the easy death it is the last pleasure the eu-
jhanasy company does it well people will pay the sum-
t is a costly thing-long beforehand go off to some
pleasure city and return impoverished and weary very
weary

  there is a lot left for me to understand said graham
after a pause yet i see the logic of it all our array
of angry virtues and sour restraints was the consequence
of danger and insecurity the stoic the puritan even
in my time were vanishing types in the old days man

was armed against pain now he is eager for pleasure
there lies the difference civilization has driven pain
and danger so far off-for well-to-do people and only
well-to-do people matter now i have been asleep two
hundred years

  for a minute they leant on the balustrading follow-
ing the intricate evolution of the dance indeed the
scene was very beautiful

  before god said graham suddenly i would rather
be a wounded sentinel freezing in the snow than one of
these painted fools

  in the snow said asano one might think differ-
ently

  i am uncivilized said graham not heeding him
that is the trouble i am primitive-paleolithic their
fountain of rage and fear and anger is sealed and closed
the habits of a lifetime make them cheerful and easy
and delightful you must bear with my nineteenth cen-
tury shocks and disgusts these people you say are
skilled workers and so forth and while these dance
men are fighting-men are dying in paris to keep the
world-that they may dance

  asano smiled faintly for that matter men are dying
in london he said

  there was a moments silence

  where do these sleep asked graham

  above and below-an intricate warren

  and where do they work this is-the domestic
life

  you will see little work tonight half the workers
are out or under arms half these people are keeping
holiday but we will go to the work places if you wish
it

  for a time graham watched the dancers then sud-
denly turned away i want to see the workers i have
seen enough of these he said

asano led the way along the gallery across the danc-
ing hall presently they came to a transverse pas-
sage that brought a breath of fresher colder air

  asano glanced at this passage as they went past
stopped went back to it and turned to graham with a
smile here sire he said is something-will be
familiar to you at least-and yet- but i will not tell
you come

  he led the way along a closed passage that presently
became cold the reverberation of their feet told that
this passage was a bridge they came into a circular
gallery that was glazed in from the outer weather and
so reached a circular chamber which seemed familiar
though graham could not recall distinctly when he had
entered it before in this was a ladder-the first ladder
he had seen since his awakening-up which they went
and came into a high dark cold place in which was
another almost vertical ladder this they ascended gra-
ham still perplexed

  but at the top he understood and recognized the
metallic bars to which he clung he was in the cage
under the ball of st pauls the dome rose but a little
way above the general contour of the city into the still
twilight and sloped away shining greasily under a few
distant lights into a circumambient ditch of darkness

  out between the bars he looked upon the wind-clear
northern sky and saw the starry constellations all un-
changed capella hung in the west vega was rising and
the seven glittering points of the great bear swept over-
head in their stately circle about the pole

  he saw these stars in a clear gap of sky to the
east and south the great circular shapes of complaining
wind-wheels blotted out the heavens so that the glare
about the council house was hidden to the south-west
hung orion showing like a pallid ghost through a tracery
of ironwork and interlacing shapes above a dazzling cor-
uscation of lights a bellowing and siren screaming that

came from the flying stages warned the world that one
of the aeroplanes was ready to start he remained for
a space gazing toward the glaring stage then his eyes
went back to the northward constellations

  for a long time he was silent this he said at last
smiling in the shadow seems the strangest thing of all
to stand in the dome of saint pauls and look once more
upon these familiar silent stars

  thence graham was taken by asano along devious
ways to the great gambling and business quarters where
the bulk of the fortunes in the city were lost and made
it impressed him as a well-nigh interminable series of
very high halls surrounded by tiers upon tiers of gal-
leries into which opened thousands of offices and tra-
versed by a complicated multitude of bridges footways
aerial motor rails and trapeze and cable leaps and
here more than anywhere the note of vehement vitality
of uncontrollable hasty activity rose high everywhere
was violent advertisement until his brain swam at the
tumult of light and color and babble machines of a
peculiarly rancid tone were abundant and filled the air
with strenuous squealing and an idiotic slang skin
your eyes and slide gewhoop bonanza gollipers
come and hark

  the place seemed to him to be dense with people either
profoundly agitated or swelling with obscure cunning
yet he learnt that the place was comparatively empty
that the great political convulsion of the last few days
had reduced transactions to an unprecedented minimum
in one huge place were long avenues of roulette tables
each with an excited undignified crowd about it in an-
other a yelping babel of white-faced women and red-
necked leathery-lunged men bought and sold the shares
of an absolutely fictitious business undertaking which
every five minutes paid a dividend of ten per cent and
cancelled a certain proportion of its shares by means of
a lottery wheel

  these business activities were prosecuted with an
energy that readily passed into violence and graham
approaching a dense crowd found at its centre a couple
of prominent merchants in violent controversy with
teeth and nails on some delicate point of business eti-
quette something still remained in life to be fought
for further he had a shock at a vehement announce-
ment in phonetic letters of scarlet flame each twice the
height of a man that we assure the propraietr
we assure the propraietr

  whos the proprietor he asked

  you

  but what do they assure me he asked what do
they assure me

  didnt you have assurance

  graham thought insurance

  yes-insurance i remember that was the older
word they are insuring your life dozands of people
are taking out policies myriads of lions are being put
on you and further on other people are buying an-
nuities they do that on everybody who is at all promi-
nent look there

  a crowd of people surged and roared and graham
saw a vast black screen suddenly illuminated in still
larger letters of burning purple anuetes on the pro-
praietr-x  pr g the people began to boo and shout
at this a number of hard breathing wild-eyed men came
running past clawing with hooked fingers at the air
there was a furious crush about a little doorway

  asano did a brief calculation seventeen per cent per
annum is their annuity on you they would not pay so
much per cent if they could see you now sire but they
do not know your ownannuities used to be a very safe
investment but now you are sheer gambling of course
this is probably a desperate bid i doubt if people will
get their money

  the crowd of would-be annuitants grew so thick about
them that for some time they could move neither forward

nor backward graham noticed what appeared to him
to be a high proportion of women among the speculators
and was reminded again of the economical independence
of their sex they seemed remarkably well able to take
care of themselves in the crowd using their elbows with
particular skill as he learnt to his cost one curly-headed
person caught in the pressure for a space looked stead-
fastly at him several times almost as if she recognized
him and then edging deliberately towards him touched
his hand with her arm in a scarcely accidental manner
and made it plain by a look as ancient as chaldea that he
had found favor in her eyes and then a lank grey-
bearded man perspiring copiously in a noble passion of
self-help blind to all earthly things save that glaring
bait thrust between them in a cataclysmal rush towards
that alluring x  pr g

  i want to get out of this said graham to asano
this is not what i came to see show me the workers
i want to see the people in blue these parasitic luna-
tics-

  he found himself wedged in a struggling mass of
people and this hopeful sentence went unfinished

             chapter xxi
             the under side

from the business quarter they presently passed
by the running ways into a remote quarter of the
city where the bulk of the manufactures was done
on their way the platforms crossed the thames twice
and passed in a broad viaduct across one of the great
roads that entered the city from the north in both
cases his impression was swift and in both very vivid
the river was a broad wrinkled glitter of black sea water
overarched by buildings and vanishing either way into
a blackness starred with receding lights a string of
black barges passed seaward manned by blue-clad men
the road was a long and very broad and high tunnel
along which big-wheeled machines drove noiselessly and
swiftly here too the distinctive blue of the labor
company was in abundance the smoothness of the
double tracks the largeness and the lightness of the big
pneumatic wheels in proportion to the vehicular body
struck graham most vividly one lank and very high
carriage with longitudinal metallic rods hung with the
dripping carcasses of many hundred sheep arrested his
attention unduly abruptly the edge of the archway cut
and blotted out the picture

  presently they left the way and descended by a lift
and traversed a passage that sloped downward and so
came to a descending lift again the appearance of
things changed even the pretence of architectural or-
nament disappeared the lights diminished in number and
size the architecture became more and more massive in
proportion to the spaces as the factory quarters were
reached and in the dusty biscuit-making place of the
potters among the felspar mills in the furnace rooms of
the metal workers among the incandescent lakes of
crude eadhamite the blue canvas clothing was on man
woman and child

  many of these great and dusty galleries were silent
avenues of machinery endless raked out ashen furnaces
testified to the revolutionary dislocation but wherever
there was work it was being done by slow-moving work-
ers in blue canvas the only people not in blue canvas
were the overlookers of the work-places and the orange-
clad labor police and fresh from the flushed faces
of the dancing halls the voluntary vigors of the business
quarter graham could note the pinched faces the feeble
muscles and weary eyes of many of the latter-day work-
ers such as he saw at work were noticeably inferior in
physique to the few gaily dressed managers and fore-
women who were directing their labors the burly la-
when the sleeper wakes



lorers of the old victorian times had followed the dray
horse and all such living force producers to extinction
the place of his costly muscles was taken by some dex-
terous machine the latter-day laborer male as well as
female was essentially a machine-minder and feeder a
servant and attendant or an artist under direction

  the women in comparison with those graham remem-
bered were as a class distinctly plain and flat chested
two hundred years of emancipation from the moral re-
straints of puritanical religion two hundred years of
city life had done their work in eliminating the strain
of feminine beauty and vigor from the blue canvas
myriads to be brilliant physically or mentally to be
in any way attractive or exceptional had been and was
still a certain way of emancipation to the drudge a line
of escape to the pleasure city and its splendors and de-
lights and at last to the euthanasy and peace to be
steadfast against such inducements was scarcely to be
expected of meanly nourished souls in the young cities
of grahams former life the newly aggregated laboring
mass had been a diverse multitude still stirred by the
tradition of personal honor and a high morality now it
was differentiating into a distinct class with a moral
and physical difference of its own-even with a dialect
of its own

  they penetrated downward ever downward towards
the working places presently they passed underneath
one of the streets of the moving ways and saw its plat-
forms running on their rails far overhead and chinks
of white lights between the transverse slits the fac-
tories that were not working were sparsely lighted to
graham they and their shrouded aisles of giant machines
seemed plunged in gloom and even where work was
going on the illumination was far less brilliant than
upon the public ways

  beyond the blazing lakes of eadhamite he came to
the warren of the jewelers and with some difficulty and
by using his signature obtained admission to these gal-
leries they were high and dark and rather cold in
the first a few men were making ornaments of gold
filagree each man at a little bench by himself and with
a little shaded light the long vista of light patches
with the nimble fingers brightly lit and moving among
the gleaming yellow coils and the intent face like the
face of a ghost in each shadow had the oddest effect

  the work was beautifully executed but without any
strength of modeling or drawing for the most part
intricate grotesques or the ringing of the changes on a
geometrical motif these workers wore a peculiar white
uniform without pockets or sleeves they assumed this
on coming to work but at night they were stripped and
examined before they left the premises of the company
in spite of every precaution the labor policeman told
them in a depressed tone the company was not infre-
quently robbed

  beyond was a gallery of women busied in cutting and
setting slabs of artificial ruby and next these were men
and women busied together upon the slabs of copper net
that formed the basis of cloisonne tiles many of these
workers had lips and nostrils a livid white due to a
disease caused by a peculiar purple enamel that chanced
to be much in fashion asano apologized to graham for
he offense of their faces but excused himself on the
score of convenience of this route this is what i
wanted to see said graham this is what i wanted to
see trying to avoid a start at a particularly striking
disfigurement that suddenly stared him in the face

  she might have done better with herself than that
said asano

  graham made some indignant comments

  but sire we simply could not stand that stuff with-
out the purple said asano in your days people could
stand such crudities they were nearer the barbaric by
two hundred years

they continued along one of the lower galleries of
this cloisonne factory and came to a little bridge that
spanned a vault looking over the parapet graham
saw that beneath was a wharf under yet more tremendous
archings than any he had seen three barges smothered
in floury dust were being unloaded of their cargoes of
powdered felspar by a multitude of coughing men each
guiding a little truck the dust filled the place with a
choking mist and turned the electric glare yellow the
vague shadows of these workers gesticulated about their
feet and rushed to and fro against a long stretch of
whitewashed wall every now and then one would stop
to cough

  a shadowy huge mass of masonry rising out of the
inky water brought to grahams mind the thought of
the multitude of ways and galleries and lifts that rose
floor above floor overhead between him and the sky the
men worked in silence under the supervision of two of
the labor police their feet made a hollow thunder on
the plunks along which they went to and fro and as he
looked at this scene some hidden voice in the darkness
began to sing

  stop that shouted one of the policemen but the
order was disobeyed and first one and then all the white-
stained men who were working there had taken up the
beating refrain singing it defiantly the song of the
revolt the feet upon the planks thundered now to the
rhythm of the song tramp tramp tramp the police-
man who had shouted glanced at his fellow and graham
saw him shrug his shoulders he made no further effort
to stop the singing

  and so they went through these factories and places
of toil seeing many painful and grim things but why
should the gentle reader be depressed surely to a
refined nature our present world is distressing enough
without bothering ourselves about these miseries to
come we shall not suffer anyhow our children may
but what is that to us that walk left on grahams mind
a maze of memories fluctuating pictures of swathed
halls and crowded vaults seen through clouds of dust of
intricate machines the racing threads of looms the
heavy beat of stamping machinery the roar and rattle
of belt and armature of ill-lit subterranean aisles of
sleeping places illimitable vistas of pin-point lights and
here the smell of tanning and here the reek of a brewery
and here unprecedented reeks and everywhere were
pillars and cross archings of such a massiveness as
graham had never before seen thick titans of greasy
shining brickwork crushed beneath the vast weight of
that complex city world even as these anzemic millions
were crushed by its complexity and everywhere were
pale features lean limbs disfigurement and degradation

  once and again and again a third time graham
heard the song of the revolt during his long unpleasant
research in these places and once he saw a confused
struggle down a passage and learnt that a number of
these serfs had seized their bread before their work
was done graham was ascending towards the ways
again when he saw a number of blue-clad children run-
ning down a transverse passage and presently perceived
the reason of their panic in a company of the labor
police armed with clubs trotting toward some unknown
disturbance and then came a remote disorder but for
the most part this remnant that worked worked hope-
lessly all the spirit that was left in fallen humanity
was above in the streets that night calling for the
master and valiantly and noisily keeping its arms

  they emerged from these wanderings and stood blink-
ing in the bright light of the middle passage of the plat-
forms again they became aware of the remote hooting
and yelping of the machines of one of the general intelli-
gence offices and suddenly came men running and along
the platforms and about the ways everywhere was a
shouting and crying then a woman with a face of

ho saw a confuscd struggle down a passage

mute white terror and another who gasped and shrieked
as she ran

  what has happened now said graham puzzled for
he could not understand their thick speech then he
heard it in english and perceived that the thing that
everyone was shouting that men yelled to one another
that women took up screaming that was passing like the
first breeze of a thunderstorm chill and sudden through
the city was this ostrog has ordered the black police
to london the black police are coming from south
africa    the black police the black police
asanos face was white and astonished he hesitated
looked at grahams face and told him the thing he al-
ready knew but how can they know asked asano

  graham heard someone shouting stop all work
stop all work and a swarthy hunchback ridiculously
gay in green and gold came leaping down the platforms
toward him bawling again and again in good english
this is ostrogs doing ostrog the knave the master
is betrayed his voice was hoarse and a thin foam
dropped from his ugly shouting mouth he yelled an
unspeakable horror that the black police had done in
paris and so passed shrieking ostrog the knave

  for a moment graham stood still for it had come
upon him again that these things were a dream he
looked up at the great cliff of buildings on either side
vanishing into blue haze at last above the lights and
down to the roaring tiers of platforms and the shouting
running people who were gesticulating past the mas-
ter is betrayed they cried the master is betrayed
suddenly the situation shaped itself in his mind real
and urgent his heart began to beat fast and strong

  it has come he said i might have known the
hour has come

  he thought swiftly what am i to do

  go back to the council house said asano

why should i not appeal- the people are here
you will lose time they will doubt if it is you but
they will mass about the council house there you will
find their leaders your strength is there-with them
suppose this is only a rumor

  it sounds true said asano

  let us have the facts said graham

  asano shrugged his shoulders we had better get
toward the council house he cried that is where
they will swarm even now the ruins may be impass-
able

  graham regarded him doubtfully and followed him

  they went up the stepped platforms to the swiftest
one and there asano accosted a laborer the answers
to his questions were in the thick vulgar speech

  what did he say asked graham

  he knows little but he told me that the black police
would have arrived here before the people knew-had not
someone in the wind-vane offices learnt he said a
girl

  a girl not-

  he said a girl-he did not know who she was-who
came out from the council house crying aloud and told
the men at work among the ruins

  and then another thing was shouted something that
turned an aimless tumult into determinate movements
it came like a wind along the street to your wards
to your wards every man get arms every man to
his ward

chapter xxii
the struggle in the council house

asano and graham hurried along to the ruins about
the council house they saw everywhere the ex-
citement of the people rising to your wards
to your wards everywhere men and women in blue
were hurrying from unknown subterranean employments
up the staircases of the middle path at one place graham
saw an arsenal of the revolutionary committee beseiged
by a crowd of shouting men at another a couple of men
in the hated yellow uniform of the labor police pursued
by a gathering crowd fled precipitately along the swift
way that went in the opposite direction

  the cries of to your wards became at last a con-
tinuous shouting as they drew near the government
quarter many of the shouts were unintelligible os-
trog has betrayed us one man bawled in a hoarse voice
again and again dinning that refrain into grahams
ear until it haunted him this person stayed close be-
side graham and asano on the swift way shouting to
the people who swarmed on the lower platforms as he
rushed past them his cry about ostrog alternated with
some incomprehensible orders presently he went leap-
ing down and disappeared

  grahams mind was filled with the din his plans
were vague and unformed he had one picture of some
commanding position from which he could address the
multitudes another of meeting ostrog face to face he
was full of rage of tense muscular excitement his hands
gripped his lips were pressed together

  the way to the council house across the ruins was
impassable but asano met that difficulty and took gra-
ham into the premises of the central post-office the
post-office was nominally at work but the blue-clothed
porters moved sluggishly or had stopped to stare through
the arches of their galleries at the shouting men who
were going by outside every man to his ward every
man to his ward here by asanos advice graham
revealed his identity

  they crossed to the council house by a cable cradle
already in the brief interval since the capitulation of
the councillors a great change had been wrought in
the appearance of the ruins the spurting cascades of
the ruptured sea water-mains had been captured or
tamed and huge temporary pipes ran overhead along a
flimsy looking fabric of girders the sky was laced with
restored cables and wires that served the council house
and a mass of new fabric with cranes and other building
machines going to and fro upon it projected to the left
of the white pile

  the moving ways that ran across this area had been
restored albeit for once running under the open sky
these were the ways that graham had seen from the
little balcony in the hour of his awakening not nine days
since and the hall of his trance had been on the further
when the sleeper wakes



side where now shapeless piles of smashed and shattered
masonry were heaped together

  it was already high day and the sun was shining
brightly out of their tall caverns of blue electric light
came the swift ways crowded with multitudes of people
who poured off them and gathered ever denser over the
wreckage and confusion of the ruins the air was
full of their shouting and they were pressing and sway-
ing towards the central building for the most part
that shouting mass consisted of shapeless swarms but
here and there graham could see that a rude discipline
struggled to establish itself and every voice clamored
for order in the chaos to your wards every man
to his ward

  the cable carried them into a hall which graham rec-
ognized as the ante-chamber to the hall of the atlas
about the gallery of which he had walked days ago with
howard to show himself to the vanished council an
hour from his awakening now the place was empty
except for two cable attendants these men seemed
hugely astonished to recognize the sleeper in the man
who swung down from the cross seat

  where is helen wotton he demanded where is
helen wotton

  they did not know

  then where is ostrog i must see ostrog forth-
with he has disobeyed me i have come back to take
things out of his hands without waiting for asano
he went straight across the place ascended the steps
at the further end and pulling the curtain aside found
himself facing the perpetually laboring titan

  the hall was empty its appearance had changed
very greatly since his first sight of it it had suffered
serious injury in the violent struggle of the first out-
break on the right hand side of the great figure the
upper half of the wall had been torn away for nearly
two hundred feet of its length and a sheet of the same
glassy film that had enclosed graham at his awakening
had been drawn across the gap this deadened but
did not altogether exclude the roar of the people outside
wards wards wards they seemed to be saying
through it there were visible the beams and supports
of metal scaffoldings that rose and fell according to the
requirements of a great crowd of workmen an idle
building machine with lank arms of red painted metal
that caught the still plastic blocks of mineral paste and
swung them neatly into position stretched gauntly across
this green tinted picture on it were still a number of
workmen staring at the crowd below for a moment he
stood regarding these things and asano overtook him

  ostrog said asano will be in the small offices
beyond there the little man looked livid now and his
eyes searched grahams face

  they had scarcely advanced ten paces from the cur-
tain before a little panel to the left of the atlas rolled
up and ostrog accompanied by lincoln and followed
by two black and yellow clad negroes appeared crossing
the remote corner of the hall toward a second panel
that was raised and open ostrog shouted graham
and at the sound of his voice the little party turned
astonished

  ostrog said something to lincoln and advanced alone

  graham was the first to speak his voice was loud
and dictatorial what is this i hear he asked are
you bringing negroes here-to keep the people down

  it is none too soon said ostrog they have been
getting out of hand more and more since the revolt
i under-estimated-

  do you mean that these infernal negroes are on the
way

  on the way as it is you have seen the people-
outside

  no wonder but-after what was said you have
taken too much on yourself ostrog

  ostrog said nothing but drew nearer

  these negroes must not come to london said gra-
ham i am master and they shall not come

  ostrog glanced at lincoln who at once came towards
them with his two attendants close behind him why
not asked ostrog

  white men must be mastered by white men be-
sides-

  the negroes are only an instrument

  but that is not the question i am the master i
mean to be the master and i tell you these negroes
shall not come

  the people-

  i believe in the people

  because you are an anachronism you are a man
out of the past-an accident you are owner perhaps of
half the property in the world but you are not master
you do not know enough to be master

  he glanced at lincoln again i know now what you
think-i can guess something of what you mean to do
even now it is not too late to warn you you dream of
human equality-of a socialistic order-you have all those
worn-out dreams of the nineteenth century fresh and
vivid in your mind and you would rule this age that
you do not understand

  listen said graham you can hear it-a sound
like the sea not voices-but a voice do you altogether
understand

  we taught them that said ostrog

  perhaps can you teach them to forget it but
enough of this these negroes must not come

  there was a pause and ostrog looked him in the eyes
  they will he said

  i forbid it said graham

  they have started

  i will not have it

  no said ostrog sorry as i am to follow the
method of the council- for your own good-you must
not side with-disorder and now that you are here-
it was kind of you to come here

lincoln laid his hand on grahams shoulder
abruptly graham realized the enormity of his
blunder in coming to the council house he turned
towards the curtains that separated the hall from the
ante-chamber the clutching hand of asano intervened
in another moment lincoln had grasped grahams cloak

  he turned and struck at lincolns face and incon-
tinently a negro had him by collar and arm he wrenched
himself away his sleeve tore noisily and he stumbled
back to be tripped by the other attendant then he
struck the ground heavily and he was staring at the
distant ceiling of the hall

  he shouted rolled over struggling fiercely clutched
an attendants leg and threw him headlong and struggled
to his feet

  lincoln appeared before him went down heavily again
with a blow under the point of the jaw and lay still
graham made two strides stumbled and then ostrogs
arm was round his neck he was pulled over backward
fell heavily and his arms were pinned to the ground
after a few violent efforts he ceased to struggle and
lay staring at ostrogs heaving throat

  you-are-a prisoner panted ostrog exulting you
-were rather a fool-to come back

  graham turned his head about and perceived through
the irregular green window in the walls of the hall the
men who had been working the building cranes gesticu-
lating excitedly to the people below them they had
seen

  ostrog followed his eyes and started he shouted
something to lincoln but lincoln did not move a bullet
smashed among the mouldings above the atlas the two
sheets of transparent matter that had been stretched


amazing stories quarterly

across the gap were rent the edges of the torn aperture
darkened curved ran rapidly towards the framework and
in a moment the council chamber stood open to the air
a chilly gust blew in by the gap bringing with it a war
of voices from the ruinous spaces without an elvish bab-
blement save the master what are they doing to
the master the master is betrayed

  and then he realized that ostrogs attention was dis-
tracted that ostrogs grip had relaxed and wrenching
his arms free he struggled to his knees in another
moment he had thrust ostrog back and lie was on one
foot his hand gripping ostrogs throat and ostrogs
hands clutching the silk about his neck

  but now men were coming towards them from the dais
-men whose intentions he misunderstood he had a
glimpse of someone running in the distance towards the
curtains of the antechamber and then ostrog had slipped
from him and these newcomers were upon him to his
infinite astonishment they seized him they obeyed the
shouts of ostrog

  he was lugged a dozen yards before he realized that
they were not friends-that they were dragging him
towards the open panel when he saw this he pulled
back he tried to fling himself down he shouted for help
with all his strength and this time there were answer-
ing cries

  the grip upon his neck relaxed and behold in the
lower corner of the rent upon the wall first one and
then a number of little black figures appeared shouting
and waving arms they came leaping down from the
gap into the light gallery that had led to the silent
rooms they ran along it so near were they that gra-
ham could see the weapons in their hands then ostrog
was shouting in his ear to the men who held him and
once more he was struggling with all his strength against
their endeavors to thrust him towards the opening that
yawned to receive him they cant come down panted
ostrog they darent fire its all right well
save him from them yet

  for long minutes as it seemed to graham that in-
glorious struggle continued his clothes were rent in
a dozen places he was covered in dust one hand had
been trodden upon he could hear the shouts of his
supporters and once he heard shots he could feel his
strength giving way feel his efforts wild and aimless
but no help came and surely irresistibly that black
yawning opening came nearer

  the pressure upon him relaxed and he struggled up
he saw ostrogs grey head receding and perceived that
he was no longer held he turned about and came full
into a man in black one of the green weapons cracked
close to him a drift of pungent smoke came into his
face and a steel blade flashed the huge chamber span
about him

  he saw a man in pale blue stabbing one of the black
and yellow attendants not three yards from his face
then hands were upon him again

  he was being pulled in two directions now it seemed
as though people were shouting to him he wanted to
understand and could not someone was clutching about
his thighs he was being hoisted in spite of his vigorous
efforts he understood suddenly he ceased to struggle
he was lifted up on mens shoulders and carried away
from that devouring panel ten thousand throats were
cheering

  he saw men in blue and black hurrying after the
retreating ostrogites and firing lifted up he saw now
across the whole expanse of the hall beneath the atlas
image saw that he was being carried towards the raised
platform in the center of the place the far end of the
hall was already full of people running towards him
they were looking at him and cheering

  he became aware that a sort of body-guard surrounded
him active men about him shouted vague orders he

saw close at hand the black moustached man in yellow
who had been among those who had greeted him in the
public theatre shouting directions the hall was already
densely packed with swaying people the little metal gal-
lery sagged with a shouting load the curtains at the
end had been torn away and the ante-chamber was re-
vealed densely crowded he could scarcely make the
man near him hear for the tumult about them where
has ostrog gone he asked

   the man he questioned pointed over the heads towards
 the lower panels about the hall on the side opposite the
 gap they stood open and armed men blue clad with
 black sashes were running through them and vanishing
 into the chambers and passages beyond it seemed to
 graham that a sound of firing drifted through the riot
 he was carried in a staggering curve across the great
 hall towards an opening beneath the gap

   he perceived men working with a sort of rude disci-
pline to keep the crowd off him to make a space clear
about him he passed out of the hall and saw a crude
new wall rising blankly before him topped by blue sky
he was swung down to his feet someone gripped his arm
and guided him he found the man in yellow close at-
hand they were taking him up a narrow stairway of
brick and close at hand rose the great red painted masses
the cranes and levers and the still engines of the big
building machine

   he was at the top of the steps he was hurried across
 a narrow railed footway and suddenly with a vast shout-
 ing the amphitheatre of ruins opened again before him
 the master is with us the master the master
 the shout swept athwart the lake of faces like a wave
 broke against the distant cliff of ruins and came back
 in a welter of cries the master is on our side

graham perceived that he was no longer encom-
passed by people that he was standing upon a little
temporary platform of white metal part of a flimsy
seeming scaffolding that laced about the great mass of
the council house over all the huge expanse of the
ruins swayed and ddied the shouting people and here
and there the black banners of the revolutionary socie-
ties ducked and swayed and formed rare nuclei of or-
ganization in the chaos up the steep stairs of wall and
scaffolding by which his rescuers had reached the opening
in the atlas chamber clung a solid crowd and little ener-
getic black figures clinging to pillars and projections
were strenuous to induce these congested masses to stir
behind him at a higher point on the scaffolding a num-
ber of men struggled upwards with the flapping folds of a
huge black standard through the yawning gap in the
walls below him he could look down upon the packed at-
tentive multitudes in the hall of the atlas the distant
flying stages to the south came out bright and vivid
brought nearer as it seemed by an unusual translucency
of the air a solitary aeropile beat up from the cen-
tral stage as if to meet the coming aeroplanes

  what had become of ostrog asked graham and
even as he spoke he saw that all eyes were turned from
him towards the crest of the council house building
he looked also in this direction of universal attention
for a moment he saw nothing but the jagged corner of
a wall hard and clear against the sky then in the
shadow he perceived the interior of a room and recognized
with a start the green and white decorations of his for-
mer prison and coming quickly across this opened room
and up to the very verge of the cliff of the ruins came a
little white clad figure followed by two other smaller seem-
ing figures in black and yellow he heard the man beside
him exclaim ostrog and turned to ask a question but
he never did because of the startled exclamation of an-
other of those who were with him and a lang finger
suddenly pointing he looked and beheld the aeropile
that had been rising from the flying stage when last
when the sleeper wakes



he had looked in that direction was driving towards
them the swift steady flight was still novel enough to
hold his attention

  nearer it came growing rapidly larger and larger
until it had swept over the further edge of the ruins and
into view of the dense multitudes below it drooped
across the space and rose and passed overhead rising to
clear the mass of the council house a filmy translucent
shape with the solitai- aeronaut peering down through
its ribs it vanished beyond the skyline of the ruins

  graham transferred his attention to ostrog he was
signalling with his hands and his attendants were busy
breaking down the wall beside him in another moment
the aeropile came into view again a little thing far away
coming round in a wide curve and going slower

  then suddenly the man in yellow shouted what
are they doing what are the people doing why is
ostrog left there why is he not captured they will
lift him-the aeropile will lift him ah

  the exclamation was echoed by a shout from the ruins
the rattling sound of the green weapons drifted across
the intervening gulf to graham and looking down he
saw a number of black and yellow uniforms running
along one of the galleries that lay open to the air below
the promontory upon which ostrog stood they fired as
they ran at men unseen and then emerged a number of
pale blue figures in pursuit these minute fighting fig-
ures had the oddest effect they seemed as they ran like
little model soldiers in a toy this queer appearance of
a house cut open gave that struggle amidst furniture and
passages a quality of unreality it was perhaps two
hundred yards away from him and very nearly fifty
above the heads in the ruins below the black and yel-
low men ran into an open archway and turned and fired
a volley one of the blue pursuers striding forward
close to the edge flung up his arms staggered sideways
seemed to grahams sense to hang over the edge for sev-
eral seconds and fell headlong down graham saw him
strike a projecting corner fly out head over heels head
over heels and vanish behind the red arm of the building
machine

  and then a shadow came between graham and the
sun he looked up and the sky was clear but he knew
the aeropile had passed ostrog had vanished the man
in yellow thrust before him zealous and perspiring
pointing and blatent

  they are grounding cried the man in yellow they
are grounding tell the people to fire at him tell
them to fire at him

  graham could not understand he heard loud voices
repeating these enigmatical orders

  suddenly over the edge of the ruins he saw the prow
of the aeropile come gliding and stop with a jerk in a
moment graham understood that the thing had grounded
in order that ostrog might escape by it he saw a blue
haze climbing out of the gulf perceived that the people
below him were now firing up at the projecting stern

  a man beside him cheered hoarsely and he saw that the
blue rebels had gained the archway that had been con-
tested by the men in black and yellow a moment before
and were running in a continual stream along the open
passage

  and suddenly the aeropile slipped over the edge of
che council house and fell it dropped tilting at an angle
of forty-five degrees and dropping so steeply that it
seemed to graham it seemed perhaps to most of those
below that it could not possibly rise again

  it fell so closely past him that he could see ostrog
clutching the guides of the seat with his grey hair
streaming see the white-faced aeronaut wrenching over
the lever that drove the engine along its guides he
heard the apprehensive vague cry of innumerable men
below

  graham clutched the railing before him and gasped
the second seemed an age the lower van of the aeropile
passed within an ace of touching the people who yelled
and screamed and trampled one another below

  and then it rose

  for a moment it looked as if it could not possibly clear
the opposite cliff and then that it could not possibly clear
the wind-wheel that rotated beyond

  and behold it was clear and soaring still heeling side-
ways upward into the wind-swept sky

  the suspense of the moment gave place to a fury of
exasperation as the swarming people realized that ostrog
had escaped them with belated activity they renewed
their fire until the rattling wove into a roar until the
whole area became dim and blue and the air pungent with
the thin smoke of their weapons

  too late the aeropile dwindled smaller and smaller
and curved about and swept gracefully downward to the
flying stage from which it had so lately risen ostrog
had escaped

  for a while a confused babblement arose from the
ruins and then the universal attention came back to
graham perched high among the scaffolding he saw
the faces of the people turned towards him heard their
shouts at his rescue from the throat of the ways came
the song of the revolt spreading like a breeze across that
swaying sea of men

  the little group of men about him shouted congratu-
lations on his escape the man in yellow was close to him
with a set face and shining eyes and the song was ris-
ing louder and louder tramp tramp tramp tramp

  slowly the realization came of the full meaning of
these things to him the perception of the swift change in
his position ostrog who had stood beside him when-
ever he had faced that shouting multitude before was
beyond there-the antagonist there was no one to rule
for him any longer even the people about him the
leaders and organizers of the multitude looked to see
what he would do looked to him to act awaited his or-
ders he was king indeed his puppet reign was at
an end

  he was very intent to do the thing that was expected
of him his nerves and muscles were quivering his
mind was perhaps a little confused but he felt neither
fear nor anger his hand that had been trodden upon
throbbed and was hot he was a little nervous about
his bearing he knew he was not afraid but he was anx-
ious not to seem afraid in his former life he had often
been more excited in playing games of skill he was
desirous of immediate action ho knew he must not think
too much in detail of the huge complexity of the struggle
about him lest he should be paralysed by the sense of its
intricacy over there those square blue shapes the fly-
ing stages meant ostrog against ostrog he was fight-
ing for the world

chapter xxiii

while the aeroplanes were coming

for a time the master of the earth was not even
master of his own mind even his will seemed a
will not his own his own acts surprised him and
were but a part of the confusion of strange experiences
that poured across his being these things were defi-
nite the aeroplanes were coming helen wotton had
warned the people of their coming and he was master
of the earth each of these facts seemed struggling for
complete possession of his thoughts they protruded
from a background of swarming halls elevated passages
rooms jammed with ward leaders in council kinemato-
graph and telephone rooms and windows looking out on
a seething sea of marching men the man in yellow and
men whom he fancied were called ward leaders were
either propelling him forward or following him obedi-


amazing stories quarterly

ently it was hard to tell perhaps they were doing a
little of both perhaps some power unseen and unsus-
pected propelled them all he was aware that he was
going to make a proclamation to the people of the earth
aware of certain grandiose phrases floating in his mind
as the thing he meant to say many little things hap-
pened and then he found himself with the man in yellow
entering a little room where this proclamation of his was
to be made

  this room was grotesquely latter-day in its appoint-
ments in the centre was a bright oval lit by shaded
electric lights from above the rest was in shadow and
the double finely fitting doors through which he came
from the swarming hall of the atlas made the place
very still the dead thud of these as they closed behind
him the sudden cessation of the tumult in which he had
been living for hours the quivering circle of light the
whispers and quick noiseless movements of vaguely
visible attendants in the shadows had a strange effect
upon graham the huge ears of a phonographic mech-
anism gaped in a battery for his words the black eyes
of great photographic cameras awaited his beginning
beyond metal rods and coils glittered dimly and some-
thing whirled about with a droning hum he walked into
the centre of the light and his shadow drew together
black and sharp to a little blot at his feet

  the vague shape of the thing he meant to say was
already in his mind but this silence this isolation the
sudden withdrawal from that contagious crowd this
silent audience of gaping glaring machines had not
been in his anticipation all his supporters seemed
withdrawn together he seemed to have dropped into
this suddenly suddenly to have discovered himself in a
moment he was changed he found that he now feared to
be inadequate he feared to be theatrical he feared the
quality of his voice the quality of his wit astonished
he turned to the man in yellow with a propitiatory
gesture for a moment he said i must wait i did
not think it would be like this i must think of the
thing i have to say

  while he was still hesitating there came an agitated
messenger with news that the foremost aeroplanes were
passing over arawan

  arawan he said where is that but anyhow
they are coming they will be here when

  by twilight

  great god in only a few hours what news of the
flying stages he asked

  the people of the south-west wards are ready

  ready

  he turned impatiently to the blank circles of the lenses
again

  i suppose it must be a sort of speech would to
god i knew certainly the thing that should be said
aeroplanes at arawan they must have started before
the main fleet and the people only ready surely   

  oh what does it matter whether i speak well or
ill he said and felt the light grow brighter

  he had framed some vague sentence of democratic
sentiment when suddenly doubts overwhelmed him his
belief in his heroic quality and calling he found had
altogether lost its assured conviction the picture of a
little strutting futility in a windy waste of incompre-
hensible destinies replaced it abruptly it was perfectly
clear to him that this revolt against ostrog was prema-
ture foredoomed to failure the impulse of passionate
inadequacy against inevitable things he thought of
that swift flight of aeroplanes like the swoop of fate
towards him he was astonished that he could have
seen things in any other light in that final emergency
he debated thrust debate resolutely aside determined
at all costs to go through with the thing he had under-
taken and he could find no word to begin even as he
stood awkward hesitating with an indiscreet apology

for his inability trembling on his lips came the noise of
many people crying out the running to and fro of feet
wait cried someone and a door opened she is com-
ing said the voices graham turned and the watching
lights waned

  through the open doorway he saw a slight grey figure
advancing across a spacious hall his heart leapt it
was helen wotton behind and about her marched a
riot of applause the man in yellow came out of the
nearer shadows into the circle of light

  this is the girl who told us what ostrog had done
he said

  her face was aflame and the heavy coils of her black
hair fell about her shoulders the folds of the soft
silk robe she wore streamed from her and floated in the
rhythm of her advance she drew nearer and nearer
and his heart was beating fast all his doubts were
gone the shadow of the doorway fell athwart her face
and she was near him you have not betrayed us
she cried you are with us

  where have you been said graham

  at the office of the south-west wards until ten min-
utes since i did not know you had returned i went to
the office of the south-west wards to find the ward
leaders in order that they might tell the people

  i came back as soon as i heard-

  i knew she cried knew you would be with us and
it was i-it was i that told them they have risen all
the world is rising the people have awakened thank
god that i did not act in vain you are master still
you told them he said slowly and he saw that in
spite of her steady eyes her lips trembled and her throat
rose and fell

  i told them i knew of the order i was here i
heard that the negroes were to come to london to guard
you and keep the people down-to keep you a prisoner
and i stopped it i came out and told the people and
you are master still

  graham glanced at the black lenses of the cameras
the vast listening ears and back to her face i am
master still he said slowly and the swift rush of a
fleet of aeroplanes passed across his thoughts

  and you did this you who are the niece of ostrog
for you she cried for you that you for whom
the world has waited should not be cheated of your
power

  graham stood for a space wordless regarding her
his doubts and questionings had fled before her presence
he remembered the things that he had meant to say
he faced the cameras again and the light about him
grew brighter he turned again towards her

  you have saved me he said you have saved my
power and the battle is beginning god knows what
this night shall see-but not dishonor

  he paused he addressed himself to those unseen
multitudes who stared upon him through those grotesque
black eyes at first he spoke slowly

  men and women of the new age he said you have
arisen to do battle for the race    there is no easy
victory before us

he stopped to gather words the thoughts that had
been in his mind before she came returned but
transfigured no longer touched with the shadow of a pos-
sible irrelevance this night is a beginning he cried
this battle that is coming this battle that rushes upon
us tonight is only a beginning all your lives it may
be you must fight take no thought though i am beaten
though i am utterly overthrown

  he found the thing in his mind too vague for words
he paused momentarily and broke into vague exhorta-
tions and then a rush of speech came upon him much
that he said was but the humanitarian commonplace of
a vanished age but the conviction of his voice touched
when the sleeper wakes



it to vitality he stated the case of the old days to
the people of the new age to the woman at his side i
come out of the past to you he said with the memory
of an age that hoped my age was an age of dreams-
of beginnings an age of noble hopes throughout the
world we had made an end of slavery throughout the
world we had spread the desire and anticipation that
wars might cease that all men and women might live
nobly in freedom and peace  so we hoped in
the days that are past and what of those hopes how
is it with man after two hundred years

  great cities vast powers a collective greatness be-
yond our dreams for that we did not work and that
has come but how is it with the little lives that make
up this greater life how is it with the common lives
as it has been-sorrow and labor lives cramped and
unfulfilled lives tempted by power tempted by wealth
and gone to waste and folly the old faiths have faded
and changed the new faith- is there a new faith

  things that he had long wished to believe he found
that he believed he plunged at belief and seized it and
clung for a time at her level he spoke gustily in
broken incomplete sentences but with all his heart and
strength of this new faith within him he spoke of
the greatness of self-abnegation of his belief in an im-
mortal life of humanity in which we live and move and
have our being his voice rose and fell and the record-
ing appliances hummed their hurried applause dim at-
tendants watched him out of the shadow through all
those doubtful places his sense of that silent spectator
beside him sustained his sincerity for a few glorious
moments he was carried away he felt no doubt of his
heroic quality no doubt of his heroic words he had it
all straight and plain his eloquence limped no longer
and at last he made an end to speaking here and
now he cried i make my will all that is mine in
the world i give to the people of the world all that is
mine in the world i give to the people of the world i
give it to you and myself i give to you and as god
wills i will live for you or i will die

  he ended with a florid gesture and turned about he
found the light of his present exaltation reflected in the
face of the girl their eyes met her eyes were swim-
ming with tears of enthusiasm they seemed to be
urged towards each other they clasped hands and
stood gripped facing one another in an eloquent silence
she whispered i knew she whispered i knew
he could not speak he crushed her hand in his his
mind was the theatre of gigantic passions

  the man in yellow was beside them neither had
noted his coming he was saying that the south-west
wards were marching i never expected it so soon he
cried they have done wonders you must send them
a word to help them on their way

  graham dropped helens hand and stared at him
absent-mindedly then with a start he returned to his
previous preoccupation about the flying stages

  yes he said that is good that is good he
weighed a message tell them-well done south
west

  he turned his eyes to helen wotton again his face
expressed his struggle between conflicting ideas we
must capture the flying stages he explained unless
we can do that they will land negroes at all costs we
must prevent that

  he felt even as he spoke that this was not what had
been in his mind before the interruption he saw a
touch of surprise in her eyes she seemed about to
speak and a shrill bell drowned her voice

  it occurred to graham that she expected him to lead
these marching people that that was the thing he had
to do he made the offer abruptly he addressed the
man in yellow but he spoke to her he saw her face
respond here i am doing nothing he said

  it is impossible protested the man in yellow it is
a fight in a warren your place is here

  he explained elaborately he motioned towards the
room where graham must wait he insisted no other
course was possible we must know where you are
he said at any moment a crisis may arise needing
your presence and decision the room was a luxurious
little apartment with news machines and a broken mirror
that had once been en rapport with the crows nest spec-
ula it seemed a matter of course to graham that helen
should stop for him

a picture of such a vast dramatic struggle as the
masses in the ruins had suggested had drifted
through his mind but here was no spectacular battle-
field such as he imagined instead was seclusion-and
suspense it was only as the afternoon wore on that
he pieced together a truer picture of the fight that was
raging inaudibly and invisibly within four miles of
him beneath the roehampton stage a strange and un-
precedented contest it was a battle that was a hundred
thousand little battles a battle in a sponge of ways and
channels fought out of sight of sky or sun under the elec-
tric glare fought out in a vast confusion by multitudes
untrained in arms led chiefly by acclamation multitudes
dulled by mindless labor and enervated by the tradition
of two hundred years of servile security against multi-
tudes demoralized by lives of venial privilege and sensual
indulgence they had no artillery no differentiation into
this force or that the only weapon on either side was the
little green metal carbine whose secret manufacture and
sudden distribution in enormous quantities had been one
of ostrogs culminating moves against the council few
had had any experience with this weapon many had never
discharged one many who carried it came unprovided
with ammunition never was wilder firing in the history
of warfare it was a battle of amateurs a hideous ex-
perimental warfare armed rioters fighting armed riot-
ers armed rioters swept forward by the words and fury
of a song by the trampling sympathy of their numbers
pouring in countless myriads towards the smaller ways
the disabled lifts the galleries slippery with blood the
halls and passages choked with smoke beneath the flying
stages to learn there when retreat was hopeless the
ancient mysteries of warfare and overhead save for a
few sharpshooters upon the roof spaces and for a few
bands and threads of vapor that multiplied and darkened
towards the evening the day was a clear serenity os-
trog it seems had no bombs at command and in all the
earlier phases of the battle the aeropiles played no part
not the smallest cloud was there to break the empty
brilliance of the sky it seemed as though it held itself
vacant until the aeroplanes should come

  ever and again there was news of these drawing
nearer from this mediterranean port and then that and
presently from the south of france but of the new
guns that ostrog had made and which were known to be
in the city came no news in spite of grahams urgency
nor any report of success from the dense felt of fighting
strands about the flying stages section after section of
the labor societies reported itself assembled reported
itself marching and vanished from knowledge into the
labyrinth of that warfare what was happening there
even the busy ward leaders did not know in spite of
the opening and closing of doors the hasty messengers
the ringing of bells and the perpetual clitter-clack of
recording implements graham felt isolated strangely
inactive inoperative

  their isolation seemed at times the strangest the most
unexpected of all the things that had happened since
his awakening it had something of the quality of that
inactivity that comes in dreams a tumult the stu-
pendous realization of a world struggle between ostrog
and himself and then this confined quiet little room
with its mouthpieces and bells and broken mirror

  now the door would be closed and they were alone
together they seemed sharply marked off then from all
the unprecedented world storm that rushed together
without vividly aware of one another only concerned
with one another then the door would open again
messengers would enter or a sharp bell would stab their
quiet privacy and it was like a window in a well built
brightly lit house flung open suddenly to a hurricane the
dark hurry and tumult the stress and vehemence of the
battle rushed in and overwhelmed them they were no
longer persons but mere spectators mere impressions of
a tremendous convulsion they became unreal even to
themselves miniatures of personality indescribably
small and the two antagonistic realities the only realities
in being were first the city that throbbed and roared
yonder in a belated frenzy of defence and secondly the
aeroplanes hurling inexorably towards them over the
round shoulder of the world

   at first their mood had been one of exalted confidence
a great pride had possessed them a pride in one another
for the greatness of the issues they had challenged at
first he had walked the room eloquent with a transitory
persuasion of his tremendous destiny but slowly un-
easy intimations of their coming defeat touched his spirit
there came a long period in which they were alone he
changed his theme became egotistical spoke of the won-
der of his sleep of the little life of his memories remote
yet minute and clear like something seen through an
inverted opera-glass and all the brief play of desires and
errors that had made his former life she said little
but the emotion in her face followed the tones in his
voice and it seemed to him he had at last a perfect
understanding he reverted from pure reminiscence to
that sense of greatness she imposed upon him and
through it all this destiny was before me he said this
vast inheritance of which i did not dream

   insensibly their heroic preoccupation with the revolu-
tionary struggle passed to the question of their relation-
ship he began to question her she told him of the
days before his awakening spoke with a brief vividness
of the girlish dreams that had given a bias to her life
of the incredulous emotions his awakening had aroused
she told him too of a tragic circumstance of her girlhood
that had darkened her life quickened her sense of in-
justice and opened her heart prematurely to the wider
sorrows of the world for a little time so far as he was
concerned the great war about them was but the vast
ennobling background to these personal things

   in an instant these personal relations were submerged
there came messengers to tell that a great fleet of aero-
planes was rushing between the sky and avignon he
went to the crystal dial in the corner and assured him-
self that the thing was so he went to the chart room
and consulted a map to measure the distances of avig-
non new arawan and london he made swift calcu-
lations he went to the room of the ward leaders to
ask for news of the fight for the stages-and there was
no one there after a time he came back to her

  his face had changed it had dawned upon him that
the struggle was perhaps more than half over that os-
trog was holding his own that the arrival of the aero-
planes would mean a panic that might leave him help-
less a chance phrase in the message had given him a
glimpse of the reality that came each of these soaring
giants bore its thousand half-savage negroes to the death
grapple of the city suddenly his humanitarian enthus-
iasm showed flimsy only two of the ward leaders were
in their room when presently he repaired thither the
hall of atlas seemed empty he fancied a change in the
bearing of the attendants in the outer rooms a sombre
disillusionment darkened his mind she looked at him
anxiously when he returned to her

  no news he said with an assumed carelessness in
answer to her eyes

   then he was moved to frankness or rather-bad
 news we are losing we are gaining no ground and
 aeroplanes draw nearer and nearer

   he walked the length of the room and turned

   unless we can capture those flying stages in the next
 hour-there will be horrible things we shall be beaten

   no she said we have justice-we have the peo-
 ple we have god on our side

    ostrog has discipline-he had plans do you know
 out there just now i felt- when i heard that these
 aeroplanes were a stage nearer i felt as if i were
 fighting the machinery of fate

   she made no answer for a while we have done
 right she said at last

   he looked at her doubtfully we have done what we
 could but does this depend upon us is it not an older
 sin a wider sin

   what do you mean she asked

   these blacks are savages ruled by force used as
 force and they have been under the rule of the whites
 two hundred years is it not a race quarrel the race
 sinned-the race pays

   but these laborers these poor people of london-
 vicarious atonement to stand wrong is to share
 the guilt

   she looked keenly at him astonished at the new aspect
 he presented

   without came the shrill ringing of a bell the sound
 of feet and the gabble of a phonographic message the
 man in yellow appeared yes said graham

   they are at vichy

   where are the attendants who were in the great hall
 of the atlas asked graham abruptly

   presently the babble machine rang again we may
 win yet said the man in yellow going out to it if
 only we can find where ostrog has hidden his guns
 everything hangs on that now perhaps this-
 graham followed him but the only news was of the
 aeroplanes they had reached orleans

   graham returned to helen no news he said no
 news

   and we can do nothing

   nothing

 he paced impatiently suddenly the swift anger
 that was his nature swept over him curse this
 complex world he cried and all the inventions of
 men that a man must die like a rat in a snare and
 never see his foe oh for one blow 

 me turned with an abrupt change in his manner

  hat s nonsense he said i am a savage

   he paced and stopped after all london and paris
 are only two cities all the temperate zone has risen
 what if london is doomed and paris destroyed these
 are but accidents again came the mockery of news to
 call him to fresh enquiries he returned with a graver
 face and sat down beside her

 the end must be near he said the people it seems
 have fought and died in tens of thousands the ways
 about roehampton must be like a smoked beehive and
 they have died in vain they are still only at the sub
 stage the aeroplanes are near paris even were a
 gleam of success to come now there would be nothing to
 do there would be no time to do anything before they
 were upon us the guns that might have saved us are
 mislaid mislaid think of the disorder of things
 think of this foolish tumult that cannot even find its
 weapons oh for one aeropile-just one for the
 want of that i am beaten humanity is beaten and our
 cause is lost my kingship my headlong foolish king-
 ship will not last a night and i have egged on the
 people to fight-

 they would have fought anyhow

 i doubt it i have come among them-
when the sleeper wakes



  no she cried not that if defeat comes-if you
die- but even that cannot be it cannot be after all
these years

  ah we have meant well but-do you indeed be-
lieve-

  if they defeat you she cried you have spoken
your word has gone like a great wind through the world
fanning liberty into a flame what if the flame sputters
a little nothing can change the spoken word your
message will have gone forth 

  to what end it may be it may be you know i
said when you told me of these things-dear god but
that was scarcely a score of hours ago-i said that i had
not your faith well-at any rate there is nothing to
do now 

  you have not my faith do you mean- you are
sorryt

  no he said hurriedly no before god-no his
voice changed but- i think-i have been indis-
creet i knew little-i grasped too hastily 

  he paused he was ashamed of this avowal there
is one thing that makes up for all i have known you
across this gulf of time i have come to you the rest is
done with you too it has been something more-or
something less-

  he paused with his face searching hers and without
clamored the unheeded message that the aeroplanes were
rising into the sky of amiens

  she put her hand to her throat and her lips were white
she stared before her as if she saw some horrible pos-
sibility suddenly her features changed oh but i have
been honest she cried and then have i been honest
i loved the world and freedom i hated cruelty and op-
pression surely it was that

  yes he said yes and we have done what it lay
in us to do we have given our message our message
we have started armageddon but now- now that
we have it may be our last hour together now that all
these greater things are done 

  he stopped she sat in silence her face was a white
riddle

    for a moment they heeded nothing of a sudden stir
outside a running to and fro and cries then helen
started to an attitude of tense attention it is- she
cried and stood up speechless incredulous triumphant
and graham too heard metallic voices were shout-
ing victory yes it was victory he stood up also
with the light of a desperate hope in his eyes

  bursting through the curtains appeared the man in
yellow startled and dishevelled with excitement vic-
tory he cried victory the people are winning os-
trogs people have collapsed

  she rose victory and her voice was hoarse and
faint

  what do you mean asked graham tell me
what

  we have driven them out of the under galleries at
norwood streatham is afire and burning wildly and
roehampton is ours ours-and we have taken the
aeropile that lay thereon

  for an instant graham and helen stood in silence
their hearts were beating fast they looked at one another
for one last moment there gleamed in graham his dream
of empire of kingship with helen by his side it
gleamed and passed

  a shrill bell rang an agitated grey-headed man ap-
peared from the room of the ward leaders it is all
over he cried

  what matters it now that we have roehampton the
aeroplanes have been sighted at boulogne

  the channel said the man in yellow he calculated
swiftly half an hour

  they still have three of the flying stages said the
old man

 those guns cried graham

 we cannot mount them-in half an hour

 do you mean they are found

 too late said the old man

 if we could stop them another hour cried the man
 in yellow

 nothing can stop them now said the old man they
 have near a hundred aeroplanes in the first fleet
 another hour asked graham

 to be so near said the ward leader now that we
 have found those guns to be so near- if once we
 could get them out upon the roof spaces

 how long would that take asked graham suddenly
 an hour-certainly

 too late cried the ward leader too late

 is it too late said graham even now- an
 hour

 he had suddenly perceived a possibility he tried to
 speak calmly but his face was white there is one
 chance you said there was an aeropile-

 on the roehampton stage sire

 smashed

 no it is lying crossways to the carrier it might
 be got upon the guides-easily but there is no aero-
 naut-

 graham glanced at the two men and then at helen
 he spoke after a long pause we have no aeronauts
 none

 the aeroplanes are clumsy he said thoughtfully
 compared with the aeropiles

 he turned suddenly to helen his decision was made
 i must do it

 do what

 go to this flying stage-to this aeropile

 what do you mean

 i am an aeronaut after all- those days for which
 you reproached me were not altogether wasted

 he turned to the old man in yellow tell them to put
 the aeropile upon the guides

 the man in yellow hesitated

 what do you mean to do cried helen

 this aeropile-it is a chance-

 you dont mean-

 to fight-yes to fight in the air i have thought
 before- an aeroplane is a clumsy thing a resolute
 man-

 but-never since flying began- cried the man in
 yellow

 there has been no need but now the time has come
 tell them now-send them my message-to put it upon
 the guides

 the old man dumbly interrogated the man in yellow
 nodded and hurried out

 helen made a step towards graham her face was
 white but-how can one fight you will be killed
 perhaps yet not to do it-or to let someone else
 attempt it-

 he stopped he could speak no more he swept the al-
 ternative aside by a gesture and they stood looking at
 one another

 you are right she said at last in a low tone you
 are right if it canbe done    you must go

 he moved a step towards her and she stepped back her
 white face struggled against him and resisted him
 no she gasped i cannot bear- go now

 he extended his hands stupidly she clenched her fists
 go now she cried go now

 he hesitated and understood he threw his hands up
 in a queer half-theatrical gesture he had no word to
 say he turned from her

 the man in yellow moved towards the door with clumsy
 belated tact but graham stepped past him he went
 striding through the room where the ward leader bawled
amazing stories quarterly

the man in yellow was pointing to the acropilei

 at a telephone directing that the aeropile should be put
 upon the guides

  the man in yellow glanced at helens still figure hesi-
tated and hurried after him graham did not once look
back he did not speak until the curtain of the ante-cham-
ber of the great hall fell behind him then he turned his
head with curt swift directions upon his bloodless lips

chapter xxiv

the coining of the aeroplanes

two men in pale blue were lying in the irregular line
that stretched along the edge of the captured roe-
hampton stage from end to end grasping their car-
bines and peering into the shadows of the stage called
wimbledon park now and then they spoke to one an-
other they spoke the mutilated english of their class
and period the fire of the ostrogites had dwindled
and ceased and few of the enemy had been seen for some
time but the echoes of the fight that was going on now
far below in the lower galleries of that stage came every
now and then between the staccato of shots from the
popular side one of these men was describing to the
other how he had seen a man down below there dodge
behind a girder and had aimed at a guess and hit him

cleanly as he dodged too far hes down there still
said the marksman see that little patch yes be-
tween those bars a few yards behind them lay a dead
stranger face upward to the sky with the blue canvas
of his jacket smouldering in a circle about the neat bul-
let hole on his chest close beside him a wounded man
with a leg swathed about sat with an expressionless face
and watched the progress of that burning gigantic
behind them athwart the carrier lay the captured
aeropile

  i cant see him now said the second man in a tone
of provocation

  the marksman became foul-mouthed and high-voiced
in his earnest endeavor to make things plain and sud-
denly interrupting him came a noisy shouting from the
substage

  whats going on now he said and raised himself 
one arm to stare at the stairheads in the central groove
of the stage a number of blue figures were coming up
these and swarming across the stage to the aeropile

  we dont want all these fools said his friend they
only crowd up and spoil shots what are they after

  ssh-theyre shouting something

  the two men listened the swarming newcomers had
crowded densely about the aeropile three ward lead-
when the sleeper wakes



ers conspicuous by their black mantles and badges clam-
bered into the body and appeared above it the rank and
file flung themselves upon the vans gripping hold of the
edges until the entire outline of the thing was manned
in some places three deep one of the marksmen knelt
up theyre putting it on the carrier-thats what
theyre after

  he rose to his feet his friend rose also whats the
good said his friend weve got no aeronauts

  thats what theyre doing anyhow he looked at his
rifle looked at the struggling crowd and suddenly turn-
ing lo the wounded man mind these mate he said
handing his carbine and cartridge belt and in a moment
he was running towards the aeropile for a quarter of
an hour he was a perspiring titan lugging thrusting
shouting and heeding shouts and then the thing was
done and he stood with a multitude of others cheering
their own achievement by this time he knew what in-
deed everyone in the city knew that the master raw
learner though he was intended to fly this machine him-
self was coming even now to take control of it would
let no other man attempt it he who takes the greatest
danger he who bears the heaviest burden that man is
king so the master was reported to have spoken and
even as this man cheered and while the beads of sweat
still chased one another from the disorder of his hair he
heard the thunder of a greater tumult and in fitful
snatches the beat and impulse of the revolutionary song
he saw through a gap in the people that a thick stream
of heads still poured up the stairway the master is
coming shouted voices the master is coming and
the crowd about him grew denser and denser he began
to thrust himself towards the central groove the mas-
ter is coming the sleeper the master god and
the master roared the voices

  and suddenly quite close to him were the black uni-
forms of the revolutionary guard and for the first and
last time in his life he saw graham saw him quite clearly
a tall dark man in a flowing black robe with a white
resolute face and eyes fixed steadfastly before him a man
who for all the little things about him had neither ears
nor eyes nor thoughts    for all his days that man
remembered the passing of grahams bloodless face in
a moment it had gone and he was fighting in the swaying
crowd a lad weeping with terror thrust against him
pressing toward the stairways yelling clear for the
aeropile the bell that clears the flying stage became
a loud unmelodious clanging

  with that clanging in his ears graham drew near the
aeropile marched into the shadow of its tilting wing
he became aware that a number of people about him
were offering to accompany him and waved their offers
aside he wanted to think how one started the engine
the bell clanged faster and faster and the feet of the
retreating people roared faster and louder the man
in yellow was assisting him to mount through the ribs
of the body he clambered into the aeronauts place
fixing himself very carefully and deliberately what was
it the man in yellow was pointing to two aeropiles
driving upward in the southern sky no doubt they were
looking for the coming aeroplanes that-presently-
the thing to do now was to start things were being
shouted at him questions warnings they bother him
he wanted to think about the aeropile to recall every
item of his previous experience he waved the people
from him saw the man in yellow dropping off through
the ribs saw the crowd cleft down the line of the girders
by his gesture

  for a moment he was motionless staring at the levers
the wheel by which the engine shifted and all the deli-
cate appliances of which he knew so little his eye
caught a spirit level with the bubble towards him and
he remembered something spent a dozen seconds in
swinging the engine forward until the bubble floated in

 the centre of the tube he noted that the people were
 not shouting knew they watched his deliberation a
 bullet smashed on the bar above his head who fired
 was the line clear of people he stood up to see and
 sat down again

 in another second the propeller was spinning and he
 was rushing down the guides he gripped the wheel
 and swung the engine back to lift the stem then it was
 the people shouted in a moment he was throbbing with
 the quiver of the engine and the shouts dwindled swiftly
 behind rushed down to silence the wind whistled over
 the edges of the screen and the world sank away from
 him very swiftly

   throb throb throb-throb throb throb up he drove
 he fancied himself free of all excitement felt cool and
 deliberate he lifted the stem still more opened one
 valve on his left wing and swept round and up he
 looked down with a steady head and up one of the
 ostrogite aeropiles was driving across his course so that
 he drove obliquely towards it and would pass below it
 at a steep angle its little aeronauts were peering down
 at him what did they mean to do his mind became
 active one he saw held a weapon pointing seemed
 prepared to fire what did they think he meant to do in
 a moment he understood their tactics and his resolution
 was taken his momentary lethargy was past he opened
 two more valves to his left swung round end on to this
 hostile machine closed his valves and shot straight at
 it stem and wind-screening shielding him from the shot
 they tilted a little as if to clear him he flung up his
 stem

   throb throb throb-pause-throb throb-he set his
 teeth his face into an involuntary grimace and crash
 he struck itl he struck upward beneath the nearer wing

   very slowly the wing of his antagonist seemed to
 broaden as the impetus of his blow turned it up he saw
 the full breadth of it and then it slid downward out of
 his sight

   he felt his stem going down his hands tightened on
 the levers whirled and rammed the engine back he
 felt the jerk of a clearance the nose of the machine
 jerked up steeply and for a moment he seemed to be
 lying on his back the machine was reeling and stag-

the destruction of the aeropile

gering it seemed to be dancing on its screw he made
a huge effort hung for a moment on the levers and
slowly the engine came forward again he was driving
upward but no longer so steeply he gasped for a mo-
ment and flung himself at the levers again the wind
whistled about him one further effort and he was al-
most level he could breathe he turned his head for
the first time to see what had become of his antagonists
turned back to the levers for a moment and looked
again for a moment he could have believed they were
annihilated and then he saw between the two stages
to the east was a chasm and down this something a
slender edge fell swiftly and vanished as a sixpence falls
down a crack

  at first he did not understand and then a wild joy
possessed him he shouted at the top of his voice an
inarticulate shout and drove higher and higher up the
sky throb throb throb pause throb throb throb
where was the other aeropile he thought they
too- as he looked round the empty heavens he had
a momentary fear that this machine had risen above him
and then he saw it alighting on the norwood stage
they had meant shooting to risk being rammed head-
long two thousand feet in the air was beyond their
latter-day courage the combat was declined

  for a little while he circled then swooped in a steep
descent towards the westward stage throb throb
throb throb throb throb the twilight was creeping
on apace the smoke from the streatham stage that had
been so dense and dark was now a pillar of fire and all
the laced curves of the moving ways and the translucent
rooms and domes and the chasms between the buildings
were glowing softly now lit by the tempered radiance
of the electric light that the glare of the day overpowered
the three efficient stages that the ostrogites held-for
wimbledon park was useless because of the fire from
roehampton and streatham was a furnace-were glow-
ing with guide lights for the coming aeroplanes as he
swept over the roehampton stage he saw the dark masses
of the people thereon he heard a clap of frantic cheer-
ing heard a bullet from the wimbledon park stage tweet
through the air and went beating up above the surrey
wastes he felt a breath of wind from the south-west
and lifted his westward wing as he had learned to do
and so drove upward heeling into the rare swift upper
air throb throb throb-throb throb throb

  up he drove and up to that pulsating rhythm until
the country beneath was blue and indistinct and london
spread like a little map traced in light like the mere
model of a city near the brim of the horizon the south-
west was a sky of sapphire over the shadowy rim of the
world and ever as he drove upwards the multitude of
stars increased

  and behold in the southward low down and glitter-
ing swiftly nearer were two little patches of nebulous
light and then two more and then a nebulous glow of
swiftly driving shapes presently he could count them
there were four and twenty the first fleet of aeroplanes
had come beyond appeared a yet greater glow

  he swept round in a half circle staring at this ad-
vancing fleet it flew in a wedge-like shape a triangular
flight of gigantic phosphorescent shapes sweeping nearer
through the lower air he made a swift calculation of
their pace and spun the little wheel that brought the
sngine forward he touched a lever and the throbbing
affort of the engine ceased he began to fall fell swifter
and swifter he aimed at the apex of the wedge he
dropped like a stone through the whistling air it seemed
scarce a second from that soaring moment before he
struck the foremost aeroplane

  no man of all that black multitude saw the coming
of his fate no man among them dreamt of the hawk
that struck downward upon him out of the sky those
who were not limp in the agonies of air-sickness were

craning their black necks and staring to see the filmy
city that was rising out of the haze the rich and splendid
city to which massa boss had brought their obedient
muscles bright teeth gleamed and the glossy faces
shone they had heard of paris they knew they were
to have lordly times among the poor white trash and
suddenly graham struck them

  he had aimed at the body of the aeroplane but at
the very last instant a better idea had flashed into his
mind he twisted about and struck near the edge of
the starboard wing with all his accumulated weight he
was jerked back as he struck his prow went gliding
across its smooth expanse towards the rim he felt the
forward rush of the huge fabric sweeping him and his
aeropile along with it and for a moment that seemed an
age he could not tell what was happening he heard a
thousand throats yelling and perceived that his machine
was balanced on the edge of the gigantic float and driving
down down glanced over his shoulder and saw the back-
bone of the aeroplane and the opposite float swaying up
he had a vision through the ribs of sliding chairs staring
faces and hands clutching at the tilting guide bars the
fenestrations in the further float flashed open as the aero-
naut tried to right her beyond he saw a second aero-
plane leaping steeply to escape the whirl of its heeling
fellow the broad area of swaying wings seemed to
jerk upward he felt his aeropile had dropped clear
that the monstrous fabric clean overturned hung like a
sloping wall above him

  he did not clearly understand that he had struck the
side float of the aeroplane and slipped off but he per-
ceived that he was flying free on the down glide and
rapidly nearing earth what had he done his heart
throbbed like a noisy engine in this throat and for a
perilous instant he could not move his levers because of
the paralysis of his hands he wrenched the levers to
throw his engine back fought for two seconds against the
weight of it felt himself righting driving horizontally
set the engine beating again

he looked upward and saw two aeroplanes glide shout-
ing far overhead looked back and saw the main
body of the fleet opening out and rushing upward and
outward saw the one he had struck fall edgewise on
and strike like a gigantic knife-blade along the wind-
wheels below it

  he put down his stern and looked again he drove up
heedless of his direction as he watched he saw the
wind-vanes give saw the huge fabric strike the earth
saw its downward vans crumple with the weight of its
descent and then the whole mass turned over and
smashed upside down upon the sloping wheels throb
throb throb pause suddenly from the heaving wreck-
age a thin tongue of white fire licked up toward the
zenith and then he was aware of a huge mass flying
through the air towards him and turned upwards just
in time to escape the charge-if it was a charge-of a
second aeroplane it whirled by below sucked him down
a fathom and nearly turned him over in the gust of its
close passage

  he became aware of three others rushing towards him
aware of the urgent necessity of beating above them
aeroplanes were all about him circling wildly to avoid
him as it seemed they drove past him above below
eastward and westward far away to the westward was
the sound of a collision and two falling flares far
to the southward a second squadron was coming stead-
ily he beat upward presently all the aeroplanes were
below him but for a moment he doubted the height he
had of them and did not swoop again and then he
came down upon a second victim and all its load of
soldiers saw him coming the big machine heeled and
swayed as the fear-maddened men scrambled to the stem
for their weapons a score of bullets sung through the

t

jn the fourth of december  the home-
going crowds on the streets of san francisco
like those in any other great city were busy
with their own thoughts the louder noises
of the day had ceased and with the gradual
peering forth of the myriad lights with which like
jewels the fair queen was wont to adorn herself for an
evening at home-a sense
of calm security warmed
the hearts of old and young
alike comparative peace
reigned on earth and in
the heavens above shone
forth stars as yellow as the
gold of california itself-
and no more illusive one
alone of all the hurrying
throng saw little of charm
in that color though as
thoroughly conscious as
any other of his own safety

this conviction was of a defiant type which finds its assur-
ance in the knowledge of successful craftiness and fears
little because little is loved occasionally he smiled grimly
almost cynically as some ostensibly rich person swept by

or as he caught the faint odor of some rare perfume
these were but pretenses to a satisfaction that he had
little faith in they proclaimed a comfort which he
thought at best to be but an illusion yet humanlike
he could not help wondering for such a life was now
well within his reach but he only buttoned his coat a
bit tighter about his meager form glimpsing furtively

though perhaps unknow-
ingly at the darkened door-
ways and the starless
patches overhead this
strange appearing man was
dr rudolph grieg a doc-
tor of philosophy not of
medicine and surgery

suddenly familiar
shouts filled the air as a
half-dozen newsboys burst
forth from a nearby build-

whose lower levels were
teeming with chattering machines and dodging human at-
tendants the evening edition of a great paper was just
emerging with its tales of a thousand horrors and frivoli-

soon to beguile the fireside hours in a thousand homes
with the usual jargon each boy tried to drown the adver-
tising efforts of his fellows so that however attentive a
listener might be he could only conclude that the days
events were not much different from those of other days
and each night regardless of the nature of these an-
nouncements each boy disposed of his wares before
the next car with its strap-holders swaying and read-
ing oblivious of their promiscuous human contacts in
their absorption in greater or lesser human affairs-
rushed away beyond the twinkling lights in the heart
of the city

  of all this crowd dr grieg alone seemed in no haste
to depart his keen ears had caught a word in the
howling clamor of the newsboys and then with all his
heightened sensibilities alert he had heard enough to
cause him to do a thing which for him had become quite
uncommon-to buy a paper he had fairly snatched it
from a boy who was running past had cast a quarter in
his direction and turned to a lighted window to scan
the headlines with an evident excitement the boy
ooked several times at the quarter he had received
started to speak once or twice but then seeing that his
customer seemed satisfied raced on

  then with scarcely a glance about dr grieg hurried
on into the darker streets toward the edge of the city
where he might have been followed far into the night
walking walking on and on with the apparent aimless-
ness of one who has a deal of time to spend and does
not find the pastime disagreeable and yet if his
course was aimless no one would have described his
physical appearance in such terms first with his
hands deep in his pockets he hurried along as if in
haste from some dreaded pursuer then and apparently
without any forethought he stopped under a lamp
pulled out his lately acquired paper read and re-read
something in it and finally with all the appearance of
one who enjoys the contemplation of a master joke that
he has engineered he thrust it once more deep within
his pocket seized his coat by the lapels pulled himself
up and chuckled-actually chuckled though a careful
examination of another paper identical with the one he
carried failed to reveal the slightest cause for such
behavior

  then slowly he wandered on through the higher resi-
dence portions of the city occasionally whistling in a
rambling way-aimlessly it seemed even like his own
wandering but the frequent repetition of a few notes
suggested the unconscious echoing of some song of other
days they were however unheeded by the few who
were still awake save one an old night watchman in
whom the peculiar strains had suddenly awakened
strange memories he seemed to be once more leaning
from the little window in his fathers house in a land
once dear to him but which he had come to regard as
no longer first in his affections now that he was an
american with each repetition of those haunting
strains he could almost hear the tramp tramp of the
gay studenten as they sang late into the night there
was no mistaking it and for the first time in a score
of years the words came back to him

         alt heidelberg du feine

          du stadt an ehren reich

        am neckar und am rheine
         keine andre kommet dir gleich

  no mistake old heidelberg even the lilt at the end
of each line had been common to the students in old
heidelberg who ever it was that thus whistled away
the midnight hours he was either a native of germany
or one of those americans who had long studied there
and in spite of his recent feeling of shame because of
his own nationality the old man hastened on around

the corner hoping to meet this possible friend only to
see a distant figure vanish into a side street to be lost
entirely as the whistling ceased

  thus it was that grieg had wandered about the city-
doctor grieg the man with an enviable past and before
whom lay limitless opportunity for aiding or upsetting
much of the social organization of the years ahead

  as a boy he had grown up in that much disputed and
undoubtedly desirable country bearing the poetic name
of alsace-lorraine early he had been sent to both the
realschule and the gymnasium and later by some for-
gotten bit of fortune had been able to go to heidelberg
bonn and berlin here he had studied under some of
the greatest of living scientists helmholtz among the
rest and he had not only shown unusual ability in mas-
tering the deep mysteries of chemistry and physics but
had on several occasions given evidence of the possession
of no common power of insight into natural phenomena
deep electrical problems had been his chief delight and
it was even suggested that had he cared for notoriety
he might have anticipated the great heinrich hertz in
announcing some of the facts which the latter discovered
concerning electromagnetic waves in  and the
years following he had been back and forth between
paris and some of the german universities where was
going on the feverish work immediately preceding the
world-stirring announcements of becquerel and roent-
gen he had followed closely some of the earliest work
of the curies in their epoch-making isolation of radio-
active substances and at the time - when perrin
was trying to generate electric currents by mean- of
the roentgen rays dr grieg was not only fequently
in london attending meetings of the english icientific
societies but had given a series of lectures before the
philosophical society of cambridge on the electrical
nature of matter these papers preserved in the
transactions of the society show now perhaps more
clearly than they did then the wonderful perspicacity of
the man in a manner worthy of faraday or maxwell
he had predicted certain phenomena-or their absence-
to be upheld by the work of other investigators a decade
later especially had he been intere-ted in all electrical
experiments conducted in a vacuum as he was watching
for every possible verification of his early theory that
an form of matter in a sufficiently divided elementary
form-atoms or their subdivisions-mght be trans-
ported by electrical forces like the ray particles investi-
gated by becquerel and crookes though this sugges-
tion seemed radically visionary the experience of the
scientific world between  and  had taught it
to reserve judgment only after a certain familiarity
with the newer rays and radiations had been acquired
did men of science once more venture to make dogmatic
statements relative to possible natural phenomena then
they had condemned grieg as a notoriety seeker and
owing to the fact that at that time he was not holding
any high academic position he had little recourse in
his adversity but his resolve to prove his point doubled
from that time on it became the dominating passion
of his life to show that his critics were wrong to
strengthen his own conviction further work was un-
necessary he would yet demonstrate to the world a
transformation more wonderful than any for which
the philosophers stone had ever been sought

  then it was about  that he turned to america
hurt but far from crushed he resolved to leave the blind
leaders of the old world and come to the land of golden
opportunity as his controversies in europe had been
largely over matters of opinion his distinction in this
country was scarcely if at all diminished and he was
immediately offered a chair of electrochemistry in several
of the eastern universities but after a few special lec-
tures before some of the scientific societies in the eastern
the golden vapor



states he continued his journey westward finally to
settle down in the sunkist city of san francisco here
the western spirit of youthful enthusiasm inspired him
as nothing else had since his student days in bonn
he found everyone ready to accept a newcomer at his
apparent worth with no questions about the past and
requiring no promise for the future

  he now rented a few rooms gathered his books about
him and began a period of study and experimentation
more intense if possible than any of his earlier years
aside from the postman with his armful of scientific
journals and letters from foreign savants he had no
visitors no one knew anything of his order of life
days and nights lost all distinction for him rest
came only when sorely needed and with no relation what-
ever to the time of day or the custom of those about
him he lived as in a prison glad that its doors locked
out the entire world of possible disturbers

during the years that followed dr grieg gradu-
ally felt his way along the path of which he had
dreamed while yet a student every fact every relation
between the phenomena of molecular physics brought
him nearer his desired goal while a mere boy he had
read with wild interest of the ancient experiments in
which water inclosed in gold and silver spheres had
been made to actually pass through the pores of the
metal when subjected to sufficient pressure why might
not the same thing be accomplished by some other force
than a mechanical one-by an electric or a magnetic
force for instance he had also followed the well-
known experiments on the diffusion of metals in which
molecules of gold and lead had mixed when blocks of
the pure substances had been kept in close contact for
a long time here the materials in small portions to
be sure had migrated under some influence broadly
classified under molecular forces were these too not
electrical could they not be controlled artificially

  then later there were the remarkable experiments of
bridgman in this country and adams and others in
england which had shown that the ordinary characteriz-
ing properties of all substances disappear or change
radically when suitable forces are applied to them he
had seen the rock specimens produced by adams prov-
ing that solid cold granite could be made to change its
form and flow by the mere application of sufficient pres-
sure he had studied bridgmans data showing that
liquids may behave as solids and vice versa if con-
fined and subjected to forces of great enough magni-
tude and many of their other physical properties were
changed to such an extent as to afford a new field of
knowledge

  all of this came to grieg as welcome support for his
theories each discovery by another enabled him to
shorten his own methods for arriving at his goal he
recalled the famous experiments on electricity and the
other by sir oliver lodge and others and the later
theories about electrons filled him with ecstasies of joy
other investigators as well as himself were finding out
that atoms of matter when in vibration at a sufficiently
high rate had some effect on the ether of space they
actually sent out waves and in some cases they them-
selves disappeared as if borne away on the rays of
energy they had emitted-radiations actually affecting
certain electrical instruments soon it was found that
as these electrical properties of matter were made to in-
crease many of the other ordinary substance character-
istics diminished or disappeared entirely the identity
of some of the rays from radio-active substances and
atoms of helium had long been suspected and it only
remained to produce such a separation and transfer of
matter artificially to overcome the great difficulty which
was temporarily threatening all of dr griegs hopes he

must make atoms-atoms of helium for instance do
some of the things that the alpha-particles of radium
had been shown to do perhaps it might be possible to
do even more

  of the experimental details involved in this attempt
little can be told naturally the apparatus used was
complex and delicate dr griegs rooms had gradually
taken on the confused appearance of living room library
and laboratory in the larger room of the three which
now constituted this little kingdom was a long table
covered high with a mysterious conglomeration of in-
struments glass tubes bulbs of quartz and other sub-
stances an electrically driven vacuum pump and a mac-
leod gage for showing the exact degree of vacuum
obtained there were also wires switches rheostats
and electrical meters in great numbers a hopeless mix-
up to the uninitiated but to the master-to grieg-all
was undoubtedly in precise order in pleasingly fine ad-
justment-a thing alive a creature of promise

  of this mass of equipment several portions were con-
spicuous beyond the rest mounted near the center of
the table was a semi-transparent globe apparently of
glass and tinted faintly to a lemon-yellow color from
above it was joined by a tube to the gage and pump and
below it tapered to a neck provided with a glass stop-cock
on opposite sides entered two wires which seemed to
terminate in small concave metal reflectors not unlike the
cathodes in early forms of x-ray tubes these two were
identical and seemed as if curved to focus at a common
point midway between them a close observer would
have noticed at this foca point a small bright metal
bead mounted on the end of a fine wire coming from
another electrode in the rear wall of the bulb ex-
ternally these were all connected by wires to the elec-
trical instruments with which the table and the space
beneath it was largely filled

  not far away was a second bulb of about the same
size as the former but containing a large concave mirror
of very peculiar appearance at first sight it would
have been taken for metal like the smaller ones but
closer inspection showed it to be at the same time some-
what of a glassy nature almost transparent when viewed
directly from in front at its focus were the ends of
several tirty wires bearing small frames at once sugges-
tive of the grid arrangement in some of the vacuum de-
tectors used in wireless telegraphy this bulb was not
connected to the air pump but apparently sealed perma-
nently and supported in such a manner that it could be
rotated to face in any direction dr grieg called the
latter bulb the mcdior and the other one the material-
izer in them lay the secret of his entire work the re-
sult of his years of study and they were at one and
the same time weapons and tools for possible good of
previously undreamed of potency

  long ago he had seen enough of the realization of his
dreams to work on in feverish haste although a little
thought would have shown that his secret was safe
even had his rooms been open to every one he lived in
a constant tremor of fear lest his new-found power
should slip into the hands of others calmly thoughtful
by nature he at times lost all self-control at the very
thought of an outsider within his sanctum and this
fear grew day by day until reasons began to formulate
themselves in his mind for leaving the house he had
come to regard almost as his own and find other quarters
where there might be no curious landlady where walls
were not so thin where fire risk would be less facilities
better and so on until as he surveyed the array he saw
clearly that there was no course left him but to move
and the sooner the better

  so it came about that before long a dray load of huge
boxes and crates was moved into one of the rear rooms
on the second floor of a down-town office building grieg

had reasoned rightly that seclusion was more certain in
the heart of the city than where peoples thoughts were
less occupied here he had a spacious room only one
to be sure and one having but two windows high up so
as to afford only a view of a few square feet of brick
wall a few feet away but these and other factors were
great sources of gratification to the new occupant and
the least of the several reasons for this was that the
rent was far lower than it would have been for any other
similar space and the walls were of solid brick and
masonry two feet thick if an inch-and the floor was
of concrete what more could he wish for greater
security and isolation could scarcely have been provided
by a lonely island in polynesia

  now it was that the work began in earnest dr
grieg had some months earlier succeeded in transmitting
helium from one bulb to another several feet distant
by means of his electrical rays and the method had
been surprisingly simple after all of the superfluous de-
tails in the apparatus had been eliminated at first the
flask containing the helium had been placed in the path
of a powerful beam of ultra-violet rays and the medior
bulb immediately in front of it in the same rays then
when the proper pressures were obtained in the two
containers he had succeeded in showing by means of
the spectroscope that the space within the medior con-
tained a small percentage of helium whereas before the
exposure it had contained absolutely none

  from that time on the developments were of the nature
of slight adjustments and improvements rather than
fundamental inventions he now had the embryo of the
creation which he fully believed could be made to grow
to almost any proportions if properly studied and as-
sisted before his minds eye lay a changing universe
its laws upset and all human notions of its stability and
fixity set at naught if helium for example could be
thus called by him from one closed vessel and made to
appear within another when there was no apparent
physical connection or functioning medium between
them why might not his command be extended to all
other elements as well

 one evening while sitting far into the night and gaz-
ing at his beloved bulbs as he had often done before
but now as one hypnotized and immovable for the first
time in many hours he gradually lost all sense of time
and space in contemplating a widening vision that built
itself up and up before him his cheeks became flushed
and an unwonted fire glowed in the depths of his half-
closed eyes and drunk with the dream as well as ex-
hausted he fell asleep and dreamed on

  hour after hour his little clock ticked away the sec-
onds and the little motor that drove the air-pump purred
on so contentedly that one would scarcely have dreamed
that its song was one of ceaseless labor and faithfulness
perhaps it knew the importance of its task and who
shall say that the little old clock did not philosophize
deeply before ticking off another second knowing that
no power could bring it back

  suddenly grieg awoke he seemed at first startled
as if surprised in some secret business and then recog-
nizing his whereabouts he almost laughed aloud un-
doubtedly he would have done so had not his habit of
secrecy and quietness become quite fixed but he did laugh
a little and for a long time as he walked about the room
with his hands behind his back he seemed to be review-
ing some pleasant scene he would stop occasionally
and caress some queer-looking piece of apparatus or
perhaps he would speak to some other mysterious con-
trivance all the time with the bearing of one who was
both a general marshalling his troops for a glorious as-
sault and a dear friend his brief ejaculations were of
the nature of assurances of promises of congratulations

  that night or rather morning grieg thought no more

of sleep for a time he pored over the books which
were scattered about the room-the most of them open
to some reference of immediate interest then he re-
newed his experimental work for days he scarcely
seemed to pause for a moment when or where he ate
is not known had he not actually slept amid his ap-
paratus on that other night he might have been credited
with perpetual sleeplessness among his other powers
but through it all something seemed to buoy him up
to renew his vigor and instill youth into his veins

  it has long been known that when under the influence
of the force of electric currents of sufficiently high fre-
quencies and high potentials practically all substances
act as conductors this fact had been made use of by
grieg in making the medior now he constructed
strange transformers for increasing these qualities as
far as possible huge coils like those of telsa and
oudin were built into the apparatus already filling a
large portion of the room devices for producing ultra-
violet light in powerful beams were added and mercury
vapor lamps replaced the ordinary electric lamps in the
ceiling this was because he had always found his ex-
periments to succeed best in the presence of these radia-
tions of short wavelength

  such was his success that he was soon able to transfer
some of the heavier gases from one bulb to another just
as he had first done with the helium then came metal-
lic vapors the lighter ones first and finally that of mer-
cury-all of course initially inclosed in a sealed bulb
free from the presence of other substances and made to
reappear in the medior but the latter for the reasons
which had led him to so name it was never intended to
be the final receiver it was to be but the medium the
agency to affect the transformation of what it received
from an ether wave energy form to that of a particular
electric current this in turn was to be further trans-
formed into its characteristic matter form by the
materializer however the difficulties involved when
this step was attempted under any but ideal conditions
had made the materializer hitherto of little more than
theoretical usefulness and then in a brief moment he had
found that the interposition of suitable condensers be-
tween the two bulbs solved the problem completely
when in operation the faintly luminous rays in the ma-
terializer brought the tiny metallic bead to a bright
incandescence and a vapor soon appeared around it
condensing and forming on the sides of the bulb as an
impalpable powder or sometimes as a liquid which could
be drawn off by means of the stop-cock below

  the principal steps in the process were as follows
a bulb containing say mercury vapor was set in the
path of a beam of ultra-violet light which in turn also
passed to the medior though the latter was possibly some
feet away absorption of these radiations by the air
and other media had been obviated by giving the waves
themselves a suitable form the grid in the medior
was then heated by an auxiliary electric current from a
small storage battery and the entire bulb was oriented
so that its concave mirror faced the beam of ultra-violet
rays then the high-frequency high-potential apparatus
was started and as soon as the condensers were adjusted
to the proper capacities the tiny sphere at the focus of
the mirrors of the materializer would begin to glow-a
bluish vapor would surround it and soon minute globules
of metallic mercury would begin to roll down the sides
of the bulb and could be drawn into a beaker below

  however some limitations still remained that he saw
must be removed before his great dream could be en-
tirely realized among them was the fact that the sub-
stance to be transferred by this method must begin its
transformation in a hermetically sealed flask entirely
freed from the presence of even the slightest trace of
any other substance then again he had been able to
the golden vapor

make the transfer only when the active beam of ultra-
violet rays was approximately at right angles to the
direction of the earths gravitational force on this lat-
ter subject he had thought almost constantly and had
even written a lengthy paper-on the relation of elec-
tronic path to the direction of the gravitational vector
-with the notion of reading it at the approaching meet-
ing of the american physical society in san francisco
but the first thought of his earlier treatment at the
hands of those other scientific societies in europe caused
him to tear it up and burn the strips slowly over a bun-
sen burner smiling as he watched the glow of the ink
on the falling flakes of ash as if the joke were on others
and not on himself

  the work of mosely the braggs and others opened up
a new avenue for attacking the problem which now ex-
cluded all other thoughts it had been found that the
x-rays excite secondary x-rays by the molecular agita-
tions of the substances through which they pass and
that these new rays possess characteristics relating
them to the emitting substances their directions were
also different from those of the primary rays which had
excited them so that they seemed at first to be only
the same radiations after reflection

  beginning with these facts grieg was soon able to
reverse the action of his materializer and medior so
that a vapor or finely divided solid which had been in-
serted into the former might be de-materialized and
transmitted to a distant place and there re-materialized
by the same sort of apparatus used as a receiver

  then came another great discovery if the flask
which was to act as the receiver already contained a
substance in a similar form that is solid or vapor to
the substance in the transmitting bulb but of greater
molecular weight the mere impinging of the charged
violet rays on this substance set up molecular agitations
resulting not only in the automatic materialization of
the substance sought but also in the emission of sec-
ondary rays in exactly the opposite direction and these
in turn bore back in pure energy form portions of the
denser material thus a single transmitter became both
a de-materializer and a materializer a sender and a re-
ceiver

  the experiment was tried out repeatedly for
example equal masses of tin and lead had thus been
exchanged and the only characteristic difference in the
appearance of the sending bulb was that while acting at
the same time as a receiver its vapors were in violent
tumult this motion ceased only when one or both of
the substances had been completely transferred still
further refinements had then enabled grieg to make
the exchange in any direction and thus the gravitational
factor which had long been a stumbling block was
eliminated

  following this last success and for the first time in
months he seemed to move leisurely deliberately he
would wander about his room with the air of one who
knows that his plans have not miscarried and who sees
his final triumph easily within his reach the battle
was won he had but to accept the victory the fact
that he was meditating on what society would call a
grave crime scarcely entered his mind when it did he
only smiled cynically as always in the consciousness
of his own security though he should not be classed
as a moral pervert or one naturally bad he was per-
haps now little better for he had lost all of his former
feeling of moral and social responsibility human laws
and customs mattered to him not at all the experiment
should be tried come what might it would in itself be
his lifes triumph his triumph over his old critics the
supreme proof of the fallacy of human notions of
security and of the more material reward which would
accompany it well that was secondary but after all it

would be pleasant to rest and in what way more enjoy-
ably than to wander leisurely up and down the length
and breadth of his native alsace-lorraine and visit again
the scenes of his student days-when the means were
available

  

thus the days went by the first day of november
had arrived and nearly passed grieg who had
just eaten a good meal at a nearby restaurant was now
strolling aimlessly along the streets and thinking for the
most part of mere trivialities but never for one mo-
ment losing sight of the fact that tonight he was to
carry out an experiment more wonderful than any
dreamed of by the alchemists tonight should witness
an enterprise that would at once distance all other human
endeavors and baffle the keenest of sleuths

  as a distant clock chimed the hour of nine he turned
back to his room at once his step took on the alertness
of one who has made a decision there was work to
be done and done now once more he was the keen
scientific investigator every sensibility was alert and
the training of a lifetime showed itself in every move-
ment

  on entering his room he switched on a small blue
light glanced around and at once seated himself before
the apparatus on the huge table in the center the
pump had been running uninterruptedly for days and
the gage showed that every joint was tight a tiny
pilot light here and there told that all wires were intact
and ready for their task in place of the single material-
izer bulb that had been seen previously there was now
a row of such bulbs six of them each larger than the
original one and they were all connected to the pump
and so arranged that each could be switched into cir-
cuit instantaneously above them was a large glass fun-
nel or hopper filled with a bluish-gray metallic appearing
powder from this ran a large tube which in turn
branched out so as to enter the top of each of the
materializer bulbs and admit the powder to any one of
them on opening the proper stopcock beneath each of
these bulbs was the usual large beaker no receiver was
visible it had ceased to be necessary soon after grieg
had succeeded in using the secondary radiations as a
returning agency evidently the experiment was to take
some form not hitherto seen

  with a last glance over the apparatus he slowly closed
the master switch which made the whole assembly of
mechanism become a thing of potentialities then one
by one smaller switches were also closed until from the
slight hum and glow of the various contrivances one
would judge that all was in working order set for the
attack whatever it might be

  slowly grieg turned the great medior bulb first one
way and then another and finally he clamped it pointing
directly downwards after opening one of the inlet cocks
so as to let a little of the gray powder filter down into

time the focus glowed and then the usual vapors ap-
peared velvety and blue and hovering quiescent like a
spirit soon to vanish then he examined the luminous
region with a spectroscope but soon he set it aside shook
his head in a worried manner and directed his atten-

adjustment was incomplete beginning as before he
swung the great globe one way and another as one might
guide a searchlight in exploring a distant hillside always
he kept it pointing in a general dowmvard direction while
the medior rays played upon some iron bars and always
he watched the glowing haze in the materializer from
time to time it seemed to show slight tremors but noth-
ing of the violent nature he was seeking then he

swung it through a wider angle sweeping out larger and
larger circles with its axis and all the while watching
intently the tell-tale glow at his side

  suddenly he stopped for a moment he seemed as
one stupefied the iron bars on which the downward
rays were playing slowly seemed to dematerialize nay
vanish into the thin air then he leaped to the spectro-
scope directed it toward the boiling vapors in the globe
before him and sat for a time as if hypnotized-held by
some strange sight

   as soon as he moved slightly it was apparent that
his excitement was very high his breathing came short
and fast and then with what seemed almost a shud-
der he sank back in his chair buried his face in
his hands and remained silent for a long time when
again he looked up his eyes and hands were wet new
lines in his face told how great had been his recent
emotion

   like one who has climbed long and laboriously to
reach some far height and who sighs almost in dis-
appointment when he realizes that no higher levels exist
grieg sat and gazed blankly before him rapt by vistas
reaching far beyond his laboratory walls pleasant lands
spread out before him through which came many roads
filled with all manner of travelers they were bringing
tribute to him it was a golden view rich in the
warmth of a bluish golden light that filled the dome of
the sky above and seemed to hover like a gilded cloud
about his fair mountain and from all around arose
the hum of a teeming civilization-the droning tone of
a busy world-the monotone of existence itself but no
it was only the purr of his faithful little motor and the
buzzing and hissing of a myriad tiny sparks that had
shaped his dream and the glow was still confined to
the fragile bulbs before him

   shaking off his stupor he turned once more to examine
them slowly their vapors were condensing in a fine
powder about the sides and bottom of the sphere he
opened the bottom stop-cock and caught a little of it on
a watch glass rubbed a bit of it between his fingers
and held it near a light it was distinctly yel-
low and the clouds within his bulbs were still seeth-
ing violently   	the end

     it was on the fourth of december when next grieg
 was seen-on that night when the crowds had been hur-
 rying homeward and when the newsboys had been calling
 out their wares with such uncommon vigor in the
 private office of the bank occupying the first floor of
 the building in which grieg had worked so long the
 directors and officers sat solemnly listening to a dis-
 tinguished looking man evidently their president ex-
 citement worry and suspicion were written on the face
 of everyone present and it was all on account of a brief
 telegram that had been received that day from china
 though it concerned a loss that would be considerable
 still worse was the fact that its information had leaked
 out and might alarm the depositors on the table about
 which these men were gathered lay a copy of the evening
 paper scarcely an hour from the press but by now
 widely scattered in all parts of the city under glaring
 headlines on the first page was the following

gold sent iron arrives

changes on way to china

       san francisco dec -a box containing

     on the liner korea mam was found to contain

       the box had been strongly guarded since it
     was first filled in the vaults of the san francisco
     bank under the close inspection of several of the
     bank officials themselves as the seals then ap-
     plied were unbroken when it reached its des-
     tination officials are at a loss to imagine how
     or where the exchange took place and they

 puzzle duel

by miles jbreuermd

author of the man with the strange head
the riot at sanderac etc

          uring the years just preceding the world
war our supposedly homogeneous country
contained numerous undercurrents of race-
hatred i had an exceptional opportunity to
observe them for i was a student at the
university of chicago that teeming meeting-place of
youthful brilliance from all the ends of the earth it
was fascinating to mingle in class with them-japanese
from their pacific island balkans from their wild border-
land latins from the vastness of south america eng-
lishmen from the cape fair-haired nordics from the
scandinavian countries-all young and all gathered to-
gether to learn about the world and how to run it

  all these children of different climes were so interest-
ing to me that i cultivated personal friendships with
many of them and finally chose as my room-mate a
young hindu by the name of raputra avedian i be-
came very much attached to this intelligent chap who
was qualifying himself to teach at the university of cal-
cutta his work was in physics-chiefly electrical theory
the longer i knew him the better i liked him for his
quiet and dignified modesty coupled with profound learn-
ing and brilliant ability despite his dark skin and his
strange white headdress he seemed more like a brother
to me than did my fellow-students from my home town
in iowa

  therefore the incident in the library came as a severe
shock to me a shock both because of my affection for
my friend and because of the startling difference in the
workings of the foreign mind from our own american
ideas raputra had been standing near the door talking
to a short heavy-set man with a red face and a plateau

ill get you somehow  my thoughts began and sud-
denly stopped right before my eyes he dropped liko a
slaughtered ox	j

of blond hair though not personally acquainted with
him i knew who he was schleicher a graduate of the
university of heidelberg in germany and doing post-
graduate work in physiological chemistry at the uni-
versity of chicago what little i knew of him was un-
savory he had a reputation of being personally difficult
to get along with right now he seemed to be living
up to that reputation though i could not hear any-
thing that was said the sneering expression and the
contemptuous snarls of the man were irritating even to
a disinterested spectator at a distance suddenly ra-
putra drew himself up to the full height of his tall figure
and deliberately slapped the german across the mouth

  the sharp sound of it made me sit upright in my
chair the white mark of the hindus fingers showed
against the red of schleichers face which grew redder
until his downy mustache stood out white against it
he kept puffing up till i was afraid he might explode
when he was nearly purple he caught himself up with
a gulp his lower jaw worked up and down and he
fumbled in his vest pocket he drew out a card handed
it to my friend turned on his heel and walked away
i had read enough about duelling customs in german uni-
versities to know what that meant

  raputra turned and looked at me his face was calm
as i came toward him

  peters he said evenly will you assist me in this
affair

  i stood for a moment not knowing what to say

  i might endure personal insult he explained but
no indian gentleman will listen to national calumny

  he gave me the germans card and walked out of the
building

  there was only one other student in the library when
i had recovered from my daze he was coming toward
me

  jerry stoner he introduced himself succinctly as
i understand it these birds want a duel schleicher
said to me only his life will satisfy me

  im not very strong for this stuff i said

  and whats more replied jerry stoner the police
arent either

  yet these benighted foreigners consider us under ob-
ligation to arrange a fight
between them i reflected
aloud

  what we ought to do

jerry stoner said vehe-
mently is to get them
out behind the wall of
stagg field with their
coats off and a couple of
pairs of eight-ounce gloves

but their minds dont run
that way i know them too
well

  well have to fix up
some sort of an arrangement that will satisfy their
pride and do them no harm i continued ive got an
idea both of them are clever scientists-

  each of them is hungering for the others life
jerry stoner interrupted me

  look here i drew my chair up to his lets
have them fight a modern scientific duel science for
weapons the real fight will be a battle of wits to
devise a secret silent blow the victims will not know
when or how it is to fall the one who deals it will not
be on the scene to be connected with it to the public
it will seem like a natural death or an accident

  sounds all right jerry stoner laughed skeptically
i doubt if they can hurt each other much if they stick
to the rules of that

  thats what we want isnt it both are well equipped

for such a contest it will keep them busy for a while
then in the press of daily work they will forget it i
cant imagine any man who is really busy letting a
little falling-out like this upset him for very long

  raputra avedian was delighted with the plan when i
outlined it to him something about the subtlety of it
appealed to his oriental mind and it also satisfied his
scientific nature he thanked me as profusely as though
i had done him a tremendous favor and for some days
afterwards was silent and happy

  he was missing all of one night and i became wor
ried lest he had met with some disaster but he turned
up in the morning grimy and fatigued as though he
had been at some sort of hard labor but he seemed
cheerful and enthusiastic

  he seemed to be taking something very seriously but
i forebore questioning him about it i could see that he
was not neglecting the defensive although i did not
know what his plan of attack was he assembled a
pocket first-aid kit containing all manner of emergencj
measures antidotes stimulants antitoxins stomach-
pump purgatives and emetics he ate only at the com-
mons of the same food with hundreds of other students
and never went anywhere but to his laboratory and to
our room at the dormitory always within view of numer-
ous people and always watching about himself carefully
he was as unapproachable as a royal personage i re-
garded his danger as an exaggerated fancy

  the blow came all the more therefore as a shocking
surprise the suddenness of it the mystery of it left
me stunned and paralyzed

one sunday morning i remained in bed for a few
minutes after raputra had risen and gone into
our little bathroom i could hear him stropping his
razor and washing his face then there was a heavy
thud and a rapid knocking which gradually died down

i leaped up and ran in raputra lay on the floor still
moving feebly but already stiffening in death he had
got his emergency kit open and one hand jerked it about
spilling the contents about the room it jerked back and
forth feebly once and then he lay still

  i grew so suddenly weak that i had to sit down on
the floor for a moment be-
fore i could look around
then i searched carefully
nowhere on raputra or
about the room were therfr
any signs of violence or ot
anything unusual

  how had it happened
the wonder of it oc-
cupied my mind for a mo-
ment then i caught sight
of the wet toothbrush at
the foot of the lavatory
the pitiful little subject
told me that my friend had been stricken while brushing
his teeth and a rush of grief drove all the detective im-
pulses out of my mind poor raputra all his brilliant
fire and his vast promise were nothing now

  again my mind returned to the mystery the only
window in the room was closed and locked on the inside
outside five stories of smooth gray brick wall stretched
down to the ground with a feeble wisp of ivy here and
there there was no exit save through our sleeping
room this had one door into the corridor locked on
the inside no one could have gotten in or out unob-
served what a foolish idea of course no one had
gotten in or out this was the secret scientific death
and schleicher had done it

  all at once it came to me that a sudden death of this
sort would have to come before a coroners jury i de-

    ovr author who is also a practicing physi-
        cian is well known to readers of amazing
        stories here dr brener has given us a
        most astonishing story with an entirely
        novel theme and a surprising ending
        throivn in for good measure we promise
        you an interesting twenty minutes with this
        story
the golden vapor



tided that i had better leave everything undisturbed
for more skilled investigators than i was i called the
police and waited

  i will not go into detail about the miserable days
that followed the post-mortem examination that took
two doctors and two assistants six hours the analyses
for poisons the minute study of our room and bathroom
the minute questioning and requestioning of myself and
all persons in our end of the dormitory failed to reveal
the least suggestion of a possible cause of death

  not a sign not a clue not a mark

  it looked as though he had been struck dead by magic
and the case promised to remain a medical mystery no
less a personage than doctor victor lecount was in-
volved in the investigation this man the author of a
book on sudden death and its causes and the worlds
foremost authority on that subject had been retained
by the insurance company in which raputra had recently
taken a policy for the presence of the emergency kit
had stirred the companys suspicions however even
this great man could offer no suggestions so the death
certificate was made out as sudden death cause un-
known a burial permit issued and the insurance paid
to raputras brother

  of course jerry stoner and i had kept quiet in regard
to the duel my first impulse was to stand up and accuse
schleicher but reflection quickly showed me that such
a course would not only be futile but dangerous to both
of us it would sound so improbable that everyone would
doubt its truth and no proof of any kind could be pro-
duced on the other hand we would only lay ourselves
open to blame for complicity in the death

  so my friend was buried the world seemed strangely
blank and gray to me i had not known that a mere
roommate could mean so much in ones life my mind
was in a whirl of torment for in the background of my
mind was the guilty feeling that i was to blame my
own brain had contrived the devilish idea it had never
occurred to me that my friend might be the victim my
mind was filled with resentment against the german
surely the justice that in the movies always overtakes
the wicked was lacking in the real world why had
the possibility not occurred to me that the overbearing
prussian might not get his just dues

  the more i thought about it the more my resentment
rose against the cruel turn of fate and against schleicher
himself he had murdered my friend i determined to
ascertain how to prove it and to prosecute him if i
could thus avenge my friend i could at least justify
myself in my own eyes for the regrettable part i had
played in the affair it could not bring my friend back
but it might wipe out my guilty feeling i thought about
it constantly alternating between the depression of
self-censure and the efforts of solving the mystery i
was quite unable to attend to my class work the prob-
lem interfered with my sleep and appetite

finally  went to lecount my regular course
would bring me under his instruction the following
year and i had no hesitation in seeking his acquaintance
now

  he was short and rotund with a fat grey mustache
his students looked up to him with awe because of his
learning and with fear because of his snappy manners
i found him at a microscope in the pathology lab-
oratory he was not much of a conversationalist when
 tried to explain why i had come he jerked out

   tell me all of it this time 

  that embarrassed me from the beginning evidently
he referred to my testimony before the coroners jury
and in some uncanny way knew that i had withheld
some information then he sat motionless without the
quiver of a muscle all the time i was telling the story

 after i had finished he continued to stare at me until
 i thought i would go frantic finally i had to speak
 do you think schleicher killed him i asked

 of course he did

 in gods name how

 i dont know

 that was all he looked at me inscrutably i did
 not know what to do or say his eyes were fixed on me
 until i began to think i had done it myself

 possible all right he finally snapped now go
 over all the details of that sunday morning

 as i talked he interrupted me frequently

 did he take a drink every morning

 did he ever cut himself with his razor

 the toothbrush ah the toothbrush

 the dormitory is familiar to me he mused as i
 concluded it is possible for someone to get into your
 rooms during your absence is it not

yes but-

 there is only one explanation possible your his-
 tory eliminates every other some sort of poison-

 but none was found in the post-mortem analyses-

 he looked at me sternly for interrupting and then
 went on as though i should have known better

 here are some poisons that leave no trace perceptible
 to the analyst

 he pointed to a chapter in his own book on toxicology
 and continued

 aconitine kills in doses too small to leave any detect-
 ible traces rattlesnake or cobra venom if introduced
 directly into the circulation that is not through the
 stomach also kills without leaving any traces for the
 analyst finally vaughans split-protein products have
 much the same effect as the snake venoms

 he regarded me steadily for a while and then thrust
 again

 now do you have an idea how he met his death

 of course the poisons are a possibility i pondered
 but how were they administered there are no marks

 of needles-

 think some more perhaps you can recall if there
 was a spot of blood on the toothbrush

 yes almost everyones gums bleed occasionally dur-
 ing the brushing of the teeth raputra was more sus-
 ceptible to bleeding than i

 well did schleicher know that

 he might have i could not make out what he was
 driving at

 all right we can probably eliminate the aconitine
 death by that is slower than this mans was and does
 not produce the convulsion that seemed to be present in
 this case but either snake-vernom or split-protein placed
 on the toothbrush saturday night when both of you
 were out celebrating the football victory would intro-
 duce enough poison directly into the bloodstream to have
 caused just such a death wheres the toothbrush

 in the room i dont think it has been touchcd since
 that morning

 in response to his curt nod i bolted out and was
 back with the toothbrush in twenty minutes by the
 time i returned he had two quinea-pigs ready he
 first injected one with some physiological salt solution

 that is the control he said just to prove that the
 salt solution is pure and harmless

 the guinea-pig was quite unconcerned after its ex-
 perience then dr lecount soaked the toothbrush for
 a few minutes in a test-tube half full of the salt solu-
 tion and injected a syringeful of that into the second
 pig he hardly had time to remove the needle the
 animal shivered kicked convulsively several times and
 was dead

 of course i cant tell you whether it is rattlesnake
 or cobra it might be split-protein but is that proof

 enough the doctor fixed his wide blue eyes on me
 again

  thats proof enough i exclaimed im going
straight to the district attorneys office ill get schlei-
cher yet

  dr lecount smiled that was a rare thing it meant
something

   the district attorneys office does not close until four
oclock it is now eleven he said deliberately wait
a while

  so i waited while he studied me i felt like a germ
on a slide

  in the first place he began in his favorite phrase
scientific proof is not legal proof this sort of evi-
dence wouldnt convict anybody my work is the study
of disease not of law but i get mixed up with law often
enough to know that you can never get a case against
that man you may prove it morally and scientifically
but not legally

  secondly he eyed me fixedly for a scientific man
you are inconsistent youll have to reason more rigidly
than that if you want to pass my class next year these
two men stepped out of the bounds of the law when they
arranged their duel now all parties concerned should
be satisfied to invoke the law now is childish in the
eyes of a fair man

  finally what about the part you played in it you
should have thought of this possibility when you planned
the duel now you are apt to get into trouble as an ac-
complice

  i left his presence humble but not subdued the de-
sire for revenge is a shamefully primeval impulse it is so
powerful that its suppression causes even civilized men
considerable difficulty as i walked down the street i
shook my fists in the air vowing that i would get schlei-
cher somehow

  involuntarily my footsteps carried me toward schlei-
chers residence for-and it doubled my resentment-
schleichcr was evidently independently wealthy at least
he spent money as though he were he never got suf-
ficiently accustomed to chicagos ways to live in a fiat
or an apartment he occupied one of the cottages in
the row opposite washington park and had a flower-
garden in his front yard gardening was his hobby

  then i recollected that he had not been seen since
the day of the challenge was it guilt that kept him in
concealment the report had gone about his laboratory
that he was confined to his home by sickness i strode
quickly toward his house

  there he was now in his garden sprinkling with a
hose if he had been sick he must have just recovered
for it was his first appearance i walked slowly past
on the opposite side of the street he stood stiffly hold-
ing his red face arrogantly above the rest of humanity
and moving the stream of water from his hose with
military precision he didnt even see me i execrated
him i almost shook my fist at him i wondered what
to do next

  ill get you somehow- my thoughts began and

suddenly stopped

  schleicher had toppled over and lay flat on the ground
he had been standing in his stiff military attitude
spraying the hose this way and that on the flowers and
shrubbery then right before my eyes he dropped like
a slaughtered ox now he lay still and the hose spurted
over him in an arch where it had fallen out of his hand

  i reached him first though a number of people also
came running up his heart seemed to flutter a little
but as i felt of it it stopped still half a dozen people
gathered before i had him looked over he was un-
doubtedly dead nowhere on him was there a scratch
or a mark of any kind

  another sudden death another secret silent scien-
tific blow this time the mystery of it elated me i left
the others crowding around the body while i eagerly
looked the surroundings over carefully behind the
fence under the porch through the shrubbery hoping
that i might find a clue to the method

  then a gleam of metal hidden in the shrubbery
caused me to halt and stagger back i had caught myself
just in time to prevent my hand from touching it there
was an insulated copper plate concealed in the bush
from it ran a cable which i quickly trace toward the
jackson park elevated railway

  the whole scheme was clear to me now i understood
the meaning of the coil of cable and the bag of tools that
raputra had carried out of our room with him on the
night that he had spent out the plate in the bush was
connected with the third rail of the elevated railway and
when the water from schleichers hose struck it the
powerful current that ran the trains overhead had elec-
trocuted him on the spot

  the crowd about the body increased the distant
clanging of an ambulance swelled rapidly i stood off
from the crowd and reflected things seemed to bal-
lance now appropriately by the hand of a man several
days in his grave movie-justice had been done

air and there flashed a star in the thick glass wind-screen
that protected him the aeroplane slowed and dropped
to foil his stroke and dropped too low just in time he
saw the wind-wheels of bromley hill rushing up towards
him and spun about and up as the aeroplane he was
chasing crashed among them all its voices wove into a
felt of yelling the great fabric seemed to be standing
on end for a second among the heeling and splintering
vans and then it flew to pieces huge splinters came
flying through the air its engines burst like shells a
hot rush of flame shot overhead into the darkling sky

  two he cried with a bomb from overhead bursting
as it fell and forthwith he was beating up again a
glorious exhilaration possessed him now a giant activity
his troubles about humanity about his inadequacy were
gone for ever he was a man in battle rejoicing in his
power aeroplanes seemed radiating from him in every
direction intent only upon avoiding him the yelling of
their packed passengers came in short gusts as they
swept by he chose his third quarry struck hastily and
did but turn it on edge it escaped him to smash against
the tall cliff of london wall flying from that impact
he skimmed the darkling ground so nearly he could see a
frightened rabbit bolting up a slope he jerked up
steeply and found himself driving over south london
with the air about him vacant to the right of him a
wild riot of signal rockets from the ostrogites banked
tumultuously in the sky to the south the wreckage of
half a dozen air ships flamed and east and west and north
the air ships fled before him they drove away to the
east and north and went about in the south for they
could not pause in the air in their present confusion
any attempt at evolution would have meant disastrous
collisions he could scarcely realize the thing he had
done in every quarter aeroplanes were receding they
were receding they dwindled smaller and smaller they
were in flight

  he passed two hundred feet or so above the roehamp-
ton stage it was black with people and noisy with
their frantic shouting but why was the wimbledon
park stage black and cheering too the smoke and
flame of streatham now hid the three further stages
he curved about and rose to see them and the northern
quarters first came the square masses of shooters
hill into sight from behind the smoke lit and orderly
with the aeroplane that had landed and its disembarking
negroes then came blackheath and then under the
corner of the reek the norwood stage on blackheath
no aeroplane had landed but an aeropile lay upon the
guides norwood was covered by a swarm of little fig-
ures running to and fro in a passionate confusion why
abruptly he understood the stubborn defence of the
flying stages was over the people were pouring into the
under-ways of these last strongholds of ostrogs usurpa-
tion and then from far away on the northern border
of the city full of glorious import to him came a sound
a signal a note of triumph the leaden thud of a gun
his lips fell apart his face was disturbed with emotion

  he drew an immense breath they win he shouted
to the empty air the people win the sound of a
second gun came like an answer and then he saw the
aeropile on blackheath was running down its guides to
launch it lifted clean and rose it shot up into the air
driving straight southward and away from him

  in an instant it came to him what this meant it must
needs be ostrog in flight he shouted and dropped
towards it he had the momentum of his elevation and
fell slanting down the air and very swiftly it rose
steeply at his approach he allowed for its velocity and
drove straight upon it

  it suddenly became a mere flat edge and behold he
was past it and driving headlong down with all the force
of his futile blow

  he was furiously angry he reeled the engine back
along its shaft and went circling up he saw ostrogs
machine beating up a spiral before him he rose straight
towards it won above it by virtue of the impetus of his
swoop and by the advantage and weight of a man he
dropped headlong-dropped and missed again as he
rushed past he saw the face of ostrogs aeronaut con-
fident and cool and in ostrogs attitude a wincing resolu-
tion ostrog was looking steadfastly away from him-
to the south he realized with a gleam of wrath how
bungling his flight must be below he saw the croyden
hills he jerked upward and once more he gained on his
enemy

  he glanced over his shoulder and his attention was ar-
rested by a strange thing the eastward stage the one
on shooters hill appeared to lift a flash changing to a
tall grey shape a cowled figure of smoke and duct
jerked into the air for a moment this cowled figure
stood motionless dropping huge masses of metal from
its shoulders and then it began to uncoil a dense head
of smoke the people had blown it up aeroplane and all
as suddenly a second flash and grey shape sprang up
from the norwood stage and even as he stared at this
came a dead report and the air wave of the first explosion
struck him he was flung up and sideways

  for a moment the aeropile fell nearly edgewise with
her nose down and seemed to hesitate whether to overset
altogether he stood on his wind-shield wrenching the
wheel that swayed up over his head and then the shock
of the second explosion took his machine sideways

  he found himself clinging to one of the ribs of his
machine and the air was blowing past him and upward
he seemed to be hanging quite still in the air with the
wind blowing up past him it occurred to him that he
was falling then he was sure that he was falling he
could not look down

  he found himself recapitulating with incredible swift-
ness all that had happened since his awakening the
days of doubt the days of empire and at last the tumul-
tuous discovery of ostrogs calculated treachery he
was beaten but london was saved london was saved

  the thought had a quality of utter unreality who was
he why w-as he holding so tightly with his hands
why could he not leave go in such a fall as this count-
less dreams have ended but in a moment he would
wake   

  his thoughts ran swifter and swifter he wondered
if he should see helen again it seemed so unreasonable
that he should not see her again it must be a dream 
yet surely he would meet her she at least was real
she was real he would wake and meet her

  although he could not look at it he was suddenly aware
that the earth was very near

the terrors of the upper air



emberton the great detective renowned
as never having failed to get his man spoke
to the secretary of the president of the state
fair and passed on to the presidents
office door marked private he entered
without knocking

  well what happening is responsible for this visit
the president sprang up and grasped pembertons hand
and pulled a chair out for him you are not in the
habit of calling on me lately except on business who
are the unlucky people at the fair that you want for
my guess is that you are after some poor birds
pemberton sat down and placed his hat on the presi-
dents desk you are right to call thsm birds i am
after your human birds and they cant particularly be
called poor-not now anyhow

  what exclaimed the president as he half rose in
his seat surely you are not after kidwell and dexter
the aviators who are flying for the fair	

  the very two men i am after

  but what have they done it must be something
serious

  it is serious you remember the windsor bank rob-
bery of over a week ago where the cashier was killed
and nearly a half a million dollars mostly in large bills
was stolen the two men who did the job escaped in
an auto they were chased to a large wooded tract just
about nightfall when the pursuers closed in they
found the car but the men and the money were gone
i remember that and also the mystery of their escape
from the hundreds of men that surrounded the woods
they did not escape through this fence of men but
over them as soon as i had gone over the ground i
found tracks of where an aeroplane had made a short
run in a break in the woods and could easily have shot
upwards above the trees and away the place was far
enough from the edge of the woods to enable the roar
of the motor to go unheard as the two men fled away in
the night

  the run to the woods and the flight in the aeroplane
was most likely planned ahead by the two men and would
have remained undiscovered had it not been for a mark
made in the soft ground by two small cuts in one of
the aeroplane tires it was one chance in a thousand
that we ever found the aeroplane tracks and one in a
million that it left the
print of these two small
puts in the tires tread

hundreds of aeroplanes
are being driven across
that part of the country
each day and it would have
been practically impossible
to find the one that made
the track if it had not been
for the two small cuts my
men have informed me that
the aeroplane of kidwell
and dexter has a tire on it



with two small cuts the

same size and distance apart as the two marks left
in the woods i have just arrived and we expect to
arrest the two aviators within the next few minutes
i thought i would notify you first as i realize it will
stop your exhibition flight for the fair

  if these two men are murderers and robbers as
you state i want you to arrest them at once-exhibi-
tion flight or no exhibition flight you will have to
hurry or wait until-listen- the president broke off
and turned his head to one side to hear better

  a roar of a multitude cheering came to the two listen-
ing men-the huge crowd at the grand stand were split-

ting the air with deafening cheers for something they
are up and off the president continued after listening
awhile you will have to wait until they come down
they are up to beat the worlds highest altitude record
here is one of our advertisements for today read it
pemberton took the paper that was handed him and read
the following

will try to beat the worlds
highest altitude record

state fair-august  -

      kidwell and dexter-the worlds most dare-
    devil aviators will try to beat the worlds highest
    altitude record for an aeroplane they will use
    the latest type of aeroplane with new wing de-
    vices for climbing and flying in the rarefied air
    of miles above the earth they will carry an
    extra supply of oxygen they will have the lat-
    est thing in wireless telephone instruments and
    will be in constant communication with the re-
    ceiving station established in front of the grand
    stand to the receiving instrument will be
    attached a sound magnifier and those within a
    radius of several hundred feet can listen to the
    account from the aviators own lips as they circle
    up-up-up

dont forget the place and dale

  pemberton handed the paper back and inquired how
long will it take them to make the flight

  about two or three hours is all they figured they
would need he answered

  pemberton decided to go to the receiving station to
listen and the president went with him

  the two men made their way across the crowded fair
grounds until they came in front of the large grand
stand here a crowd of several thousand people were
jammed around a platform on which were a few men
and a table of instruments the largest part of which
were four huge phonograph-like horns that faced in four
directions they made their way through the crowd
and had just climbed to the platform when a voice issued
from the horns the words were

  have just reached three
thousand feet

  looking upwards pem-
berton could see a speck
circling above and rapidly
growing smaller it was
the aeroplane winging its
way ever higher and high-
er he leaned over to the
president how is it we
can hear their voices and
can not hear the roar of
the motor on the ground
it was impossible to hear
a voice because of the
deafening roar of an aeroplane motor

  the president leaned over and tapped one of the men
on the shoulder who was tinkering with the instrument
and said billy tell mr pemberton here about the wire-
less telephone-tell him why one can hear a voice from
above and yet not hear the roar of the motors

  billy dropped into a chair next to pemberton and keep-
ing one eye on the instrument explained

  kidwell and dexter are using the same kind of wire-
less telephone instruments that our aviators in france
had begun to use when the war ended to communicate
with each other and with headquarters you know sound

 ur knowledge of the upper air is very
 limited the highest point a human being
 has ever ascended in a free balloon is
 about seven miles what exists beyond
 this we do not know our new author
 presents a very unusual as well as com-
 plex situation with a typical  henry end-
 ing as to ourselves we enjoyed the story
 hugely and the chances are that you will too

is vibration of the air and travels in waves and in a
straight line unless turned aside by something the
aviators instrument is like a helmet and covers most of
his head the receivers are flat and lie over his ears
the outside sound is deadened by the padding in the
helmet and it was found that it would be necessary for
the padding to cover most of the lower jaw to kill the
outside sound the mouth-piece the part they talk into
is fastened directly in front of the mouth it is padded
to stop the outside sound only a tube-like opening
directly even with the persons mouth is left unpadded
there are three or four small holes in the tube and when
the person talks his voice is thrown straight through the
small openings and makes the instrument work while
other sounds pass by as the waves do not get a straight
entrance to the diaphragm

  both the receivers and the mouth-piece have wires
running to a plug in the side of the aeroplane which
connects with the batteries and instrument that send the
wireless waves in all directions and reach us they also
catch any that we should send and transfer it to speech
when it reaches the ears instead of the usual receiving
instrument we have hooked on a sound magnifier here
so that everybody can hear directly now the very-
one mile up and everything is running fine

  the voice of one of the men from the speck above
spoke from the horns a cheer greeted the announce-
ment

ttii is doing the talking pemberton asked

  vv kidwell will do all the talking because it is
he who is equipped with the long distance sending and
receiving apparatus dexter can talk with kidwell and
kidwell can talk with dexter by changing the plug at
the side of the machine so he is directly connected with
dexter dexter is the pilot in the rear seat and will
drive unless something happens if something should
happen kidwell can drive as they have double controls
hey below we are having fun up here chasing toy
balloons those that have been let loose on the fair
grounds have reached this far up there are twenty
or thirty in sight we have run down three or four
one was thrown back by the propellers draft and hit
old dex on the head and busted he would have
jumped out of his seat if he were not tied down with a
safety belt thought part of the machinery had hit him

i guess we are climbing in circles and staying over the
fair grounds as nearly as we can the hand on our
instrument is gradually crawling near two miles and we
can begin to tell it is getting very cold we feel sorry
for you poor land mortals below sweating in that 
degrees in the shade but say you dont have to stay
in the shade-ha ha

  the sound of kidwells laughter from two miles above
roared through the horns it ceased and no other sound
came from above for several minutes

  got another balloon caught it alive this time going
to tie my pipe to it and drop it overboard the pipe
will pull it down tell the kids down there i will give
five dollars to the one who gets it and i will wring their
necks if any of them busts my pipe here she goes-
cheers and laughter greeted this last announcement
and many small boys jammed in the crowd began to
crowd and squirm frantically to get out into the center
field where they could watch for kidwells pipe pulling a
toy balloon down

  you below we are going to have trouble in just a
minute saw several balloons above us snatched and
rushed east at a speed that makes us look like a snail
its one of those terrific wind currents that different
persons have discovered two or three miles up we will
be  k when we get in it but going from slow to fast

air is going to give us some rough riding we are
starting i can feel our old machine beginning to pitch
here we go-god we are pitching and spinning like a
leaf we are on our tail-now we are upsidei down
over we go sideways-now we are level-whew we just
made a complete flip-flop its a wonder we hold to-
gether-we are rocking and pitching like a row boat on
a stormy ocean

  we are getting up in the main current and dont
pitch so much it is all i can do to hold mydinner down
im sea-sick-we are heading west but i think we are
losing several miles a minute as this terrific air current
drifts us east

  a deadly hush fell on the crowd below as they pic-
tured the aeroplane being tossed and pitched about in
one of the mighty air currents that are found miles above
the earth they could see the two men fighting to keep
their machine right side up as they fought through the
eddies and whirls at the edge of the current and into
the steady but fast moving air of the center when
kidwell announced that they had made it a mighty cheer
went up several minutes passed and no sound came
from the men miles above-then-

  hurrah for the liberty motor-we just had another
fight to get out of the big current and are now in still
air above it we were pitched and flung about upside
down and every which way just as when we entered it
our motor did not miss a lick old dex got sick i
saw him gulping and raise his helmet and lean over but
nothing happened now we are riding smoothly we
are heading straight west instead of circling so as to
gain the distance we were carried backwards in the big
air current it is getting cold we are using oxygen
from our tanks as the air is mighty thin here-dex
has just called my attention to our instrument-what do
you reckon she reads-whoop-she has touched it shes
reached thirty thousand feet well make it well break
that old worlds altitude record

  a roar that shook the grand stand went up from the
listening crowd below for ten minutes they cheered
and flung things in the air in their excitement a few
more minutes and the worlds highest altitude record
would belong to america once more the cheering died
down and then broke out afresh

  what is the worlds record pemberton leaned
over and shouted above the din into the presidents ear

   a little less than thirty-five thousand feet the presi-
dent answered in one of the partly quiet spells of the
crowd

  thirty-one thousand came from the horns-only
those right against them could hear but they began to
relay the news thirty-one thousand another deaf-
ening cheer rang out the crowd became silent as the
president raised his hand for silence and pointed to the
horns

  thirty-two thousand and old dex grinning like a
frog

  this time only a laugh from the crowd greeted the
announcement they would hold their cheers for the last
as they wanted to hear all now

  its just about there-now its closer-just a little

more-near-nearer-gee it moves slowly-just ready

to touch-now it touches-whoopee-its over-we have
reached the worlds altitude record-now we have passed
it

  the grand stand roared and shook as the crowd below
let loose hats flew high in the air men thumped each
other like boys once more the worlds altitude record
belonged to america-to the united states-brought to
it by the two dauntless aviators far out of sight in the
vast space above those in the grand stand began to
stamp and shout in unison and stopped only when the
the terrors of the upper air



stand threatened to break under the strains of the thous-
ands of thumping feet at the rear of the mass of peo-
ple a boy with a toy balloon struggled to get through
to the platform

  hey kid look out or youll get hurt crowding in like
that a man addressed him

  i caught the pipe the boy cried as he held aloft a
pipe tied to the balloon string

  kidwells pipe-kidwells pipe-the man shouted as
he gathered the boy up and held him above the crowds
head from hand to hand they passed the boy to the
platform where the president of the fair met him and
led him to the front of the platform where the boy
held up the toy balloon with the pipe tied to it the
boy was still panting for he had caught the pipe nearly
a quarter of a mile away and had run all the way back
to the crowd while other boys chased him the presi-
dent took a five dollar bill from his pocket and gave it
to the boy and took possession of the pipe the boy
struck through the crowd headed for the refreshment
stands while the president returned to his seat

forty thousand feet up and cold as fifty north poles
the people became quiet with awe not satisfied with
breaking the worlds altitude record these two dare-
devils were steadily climbing higher and higher forty
thousand feet-miles high-how far would they go

  we have just noticed a queer color of the air just a
short way to our west although we can hardly call it
color it might be just our imagination anyway dex
has headed the machine in that direction-yes we no-
tice the difference more as we get closer-turn her dex
-turn her-my god its a whirlwind-loop her back

dex-turn-

  the last regarding turning the machine came from the
horns in a shout and must have been meant for dexter
it broke off suddenly as kidwell must have changed the
plug from below to connect with dexter

thousands of eyes unconsciously looked upward
although all knew that it was impossible to see to
the great height the aeroplane had attained but all
realized that something serious was happening miles
above what had happened would the aeroplane come
flying down from above and land a shattered wreck

  minutes passed and no voice was heard through the
horn the suspense became unbearable several more
minutes passed and at last came-

  hello below-we thought we were gone that time
we ran into a whirling draft of air of cyclone speed
our machine was caught in it and we were pitched over
and over like a feather whirling tossing and tumbling
we were flung up-up-and up we dont know how far
up we are now because we were carried upward for many
minutes at many miles a minute our instrument only
registers sixty thousand feet and the hand reached that
mark long before we were pitched out of the whirling
mass and into still air the current seems to come up
and then turn east and we were flung to the top side
we must be fifteen or twenty miles high-way above any
height we dreamed a person could fly our motor does
not run as smoothly as it did below but it is doing fairly
well we still have to use our own supply of oxygen
the movements of the machine are rather slow and slug-
gish it might be that we are flying in air hurled up in
that mighty up-rushing funnel of air from below we
can not understand it we are circling about getting our
nerve back to make a dive for the earth if we get
through the high eastward current of air and miss the
upward whirlwind we will be  k if we hit the
upward whirlwind we will be flung back like a leaf
we can feel the intense cold through all our furs it
must be fifty degrees below zero nothing but space

space space as far as you can see and in every direction
you feel like loosening your belt stepping on the edge
of the machine and stepping off into-nothing-you feel

as though there were no world-no god-no-

  the voice broke off and then continued with a note of
excitement in it

  we have made a discovery there are clouds up here
-dex just pointed several out to me and we are headed
for them they seem very dense as we get nearer
for several minutes the voice stopped and those below
talked in suppressed excitement they were past the
cheering stage now what had happened miles above
the earth had made them curious and started them
thinking then the voice came quivering with a tone
of excitement

  people below i am going to make a statement to
you that will seem unbelieveable a statement that will
upset all past theories of the upper air if i were not
sure of bringing down proofs of my statements i would
not make it and i dont even ask you to believe it until
we come back

  people below-there is vegetable and animal life here
we are now flying above a floating island of vegetable
substance while around us and above are hundreds of
other floating islands of the same substance i have
managed to catch a small handful of the substance as it
floated in the air between the larger bodies of the same
thing

  it is nearly transparent but has a pale greenish color
it is spongy and tough being made up of a rubber-like
material full of thousands of small gas pockets it must
be this gas that keeps it afloat at this great height it
grows on long rope-like branches like sea-kelp or some
kind of moss what we took for clouds were great
masses of this plant matted together and floating about
i believe we could walk on these islands but it would
be impossible to land our aeroplane for it would sink too
deep to get it out again

ttte have seen a small bat-like animal fly from one
vv island to another another of the same kind of
creatures is flying alongside us and keeps turning its
head to watch us as though it wonders what we are
i believe it is as much surprised to see us as we are to
see it dex has just notified me that he will try to run
it down and wants me to catch or kill it we must bring
down proofs or we would never dare tell of such things
as are up here here we go-we are after the bat-iike
animal zip-the blamed little thing is gone it was just
fooling along with us and when we whirled to reach it
it shot away like a bullet they are too speedy for us
to run down i was close enough to see that it was
nearly the size and shape of a bat except that it had
a head like a bird with large owl-like eyes and had a
beak instead of a mouth with teeth it was of the same
pale sickly green like the plants we have found

  dex has spied something else ahead and is pointing
for me to see but i fail to make it out now i see it
it is something long twisting through the air it is
turning and coming this way it is another animal or
a reptile for it is more like a snake no not like a
snake either for it is about ten feet long and fiat as
can be its head is also formed with a beak it looks
like a huge ribbon floating through the air it has
turned and is flying above and to one side of us looking
down at us while it winds its way along if we can
get within striking distance i will take a swipe at it
with a wrench i would like to bring it down-look out
dex-now-hold her steady

  the last came in a shouted command and must have

been meant for dexter then-

  that queer snake-like thing turned and in a flash


amazing stories quarterly

had straightened out in a line and shot down on us
like a bullet it hit the top of our right wing and went
through as though the wing were a spider web then
it struck one of our stay wires and was split long ways
for a foot or more it clung to the wire thrashing about
a blood of that pale greenish color oozing out when i
was ready to go out on the wing and try to get it it
fell on the lower plane and was blown off it fell below
to the plant island over which we are flying now if
it had struck either of us it would have been death a
short distance more and we will make the dive for earth
as our oxygen supply is getting low i have been catch-
ing stray pieces of the plants of which the islands are
made and have a bunch packed in the bottom of my cock-
pit there is also a large bunch caught in the wires
of our left wing and several small bunches caught in
other places these might hold fast until we get down
i have been wondering if the change of pressure on the
plant and animals-if we can catch any animals to bring
down-will cause them to contract the effect on them
should be just the opposite of the effect on the fish that
have been brought up from two miles or more under the
sea when they came up the pressure was so much less
that some swelled up and exploded i believe these ani-
mals would be pressed together more if brought to the
denser air of the earths surface this plant up here
might be made good use of below at some future time

and if of all the sights-what monsters what

fierce fighting monsters look at the great gashes they
are tearing in each other they cant last

   oh i forgot you below-we just turned a half circle
around the end of a medium sized floating island and have
come upon one of the most awful battles between two of
he biggest and fiercest of monsters one is like a large
flying alligator except that it has a huge beak and large
bat-like wings the other is shaped like an octopus
but has flat arms and two large balloon-like appendages
on its back it has a hellish beak they are closed in
one biting clawing and choking mass we are circling
them and watching the flying alligator just laid open
one of the devil-fish of the airs balloons it shrank as
though it were full of gas now they are whirling on the
air so fast you can hardly tell what is happening the
alligator has lost the use of one of its wings the octopus
has wrapped several of its arms around it they are
starting to sink theyre dropping two of the arms bit-
ten off everything up here is that sickly green both mon-
sters are that color and they are bleeding the green blood
-if it is blood they are now covered with gashes all
over their bodies they cant last much longer there
goes the other balloon it shrinks-now they are falling

i fthey dont stop fighting we are following them
i down and still circling around them the two
fighting air demons have fallen on the big island below
us they are hardly able to move the alligator devil
is now on top and rending the octopus to shreds its
days are over the flying alligator-for i dont know
what else to call it-is victor but it will never be able
to fly again one wing is completely torn in shreds and
the other is not much better its body is full of big
wounds the din of their screams and clashing of their
beaks must have been awful where they came from or
what they were fighting about we do not know it was
one of the most terrific and most awe-inspiring sights
man ever witnessed

   the flying alligator has risen on its hind legs and
is trying to lunge itself into the air but it can only
flutter like a broken-winged bird it is giving out its
cry as we can see by the motion of its beak

  dex shut off the motor for an instant and drifted
 e over its head it uttered a piercing scream like

a thousand wild cat whistles and lunged up for us i
hate to think what would have happened if it had been
able to fly i believe it would have rent us in pieces in
a second we are leaving here right now for dex has
pointed out another flying alligator about a mile away
which is coming this way it must be answering the
wounded ones cries it is traveling fast and coming from
the north we can see its giant bat-like wings beating
the air and it rises and falls at each stroke we are
speeding westward and as soon as we reach the edge of
this extra large floating island over which we are flying
we will dive for the earth we can not see the edge
but it cannot be over a mile or so we have left the
wounded flying alligator about a half mile back and the
other monster has already reached it and has circled
above it once

  god it has turned and is headed after us its huge
wings beating faster than before we must reach the
edge and dive for it travels twice as fast as our slug-
gish-acting machine i am not scared for i can see the
edge about two miles ahead and we will reach it before
the demon can overtake us another has dropped from
above where the wounded alligator is and it also is
now headed after us miles above the earth and being
chased by two hideous monsters have you ever noticed
birds flying when they beat their wings downwards
they not only go forward but partly upward as well and
when they raise their wings for another stroke they
sink a little instead of keeping a straight course ahead
that is the way these demons fly dex is giving our
machine all it will take

  the two demons are going fast but we will reach
the edge before they can catch us god help us an-
other monster and straight ahead we can not go that
way and must turn south or north no not north for

i	see two coming from that direction we are nearly
surrounded and our only hope is south i see the edge
south but it is a mile farther away than west but
we will make it i dont see any of the demons coming
from that direction our machine is roaring at full
speed but we are not making over fifty or sixty miles in
this rarefied sir the demons of this upper air are
flying twice as fast and now there are nearly a dozen
close on our trail and swiftly gaining    we are near
the edge and our danger is over a minute more and
we would have been lost for now there are two monsters
in front of us we are surrounded but we will reach
the edge and will head down like a bullet before they
can get near enough to head us off their screams are
bringing other monsters from all directions

  just passed one of those hideous flying devil-fish and
see another ahead and above us we are ust at the
edge and are tipping down for our long dive will be
with you in a few-dex dex look out for the devil-
fish for gods sake look dex-oh god too late-

we are done our propeller is shattered we are falling
look out below-no we have fallen on the edge of the
island we are tearing through no we have stopped
god we are in a fix the devil-fish flung itself at us
and into our propeller and wrecked it and blocked the
controls and we fell straight down   we are within
a few hundred feet of the edge the weight of the ma-
chine has sunk us until we rest in a sloping crater
about fifty feet deep the monsters are arriving and
flying in circles above us our motor is quiet and when
we raise our receivers the screams and snapping of their
giant beaks almost deafen us our only hope now is to
reach the edge and trust ourselves to our safety para-
chutes

  for several minutes the horns were quiet and the peo-
ple jammed around them listening for further word from

the two men in the void above they whispered together
the terrors of the upper air



in low under-tones and every minute or so their eyes
traveled upward in an attempt to pierce the blind of the
miles distance but in vain at last-it seemed hours
though it was only a few minutes-the voice came again

  we took our parachutes from their holders on the
side of the machine and started up to the top of the
sink-hole we are in the monsters began to come closer
as we neared the top and one made a dive for us so
we retreated to the machine they seem to be afraid to
come into this pit we are in we found a place on one
side of the pit where the vegetable has been pulled until
it has pulled apart and we can see below we are going
to this hole now and enlarge it sufficiently to enable us
to drop through-all is clear below-so good bye but
watch for us to come sailing down soon we are carrying
oxygen tanks with us to breathe

  the voice ceased and the crowd began to watch above
for any specks that might turn out to be the two men and
their parachutes many minutes passed then the voice
came a voice filled with a tone of despair and terror

fthey got poor dexter he went first after we had
a enlarged the hole and before he had dropped five
hundred feet a dozen of the monsters were after him
helpless in the parachute they dived on him and dragged
him up to the top of the island and tore him to shreds
now they are screaming and snapping their beaks above
this pit and are swooping nearer and nearer  their
taste of blood seems to have made them wilder i will
fight them from the cockpit and if i can hold out until
night i might rop through the hole and escape in the
darkness i have broken a spar loose for a club they
are coming closer i struck at that one it just missed
my head they are gathering in a bunch they are div-
ing for me in one mass im lost-good-bye

  a shriek of a man in mortal agony and terror
rang out in the air followed by a shriek from the
crowd then all was still the people knew all was
over in the far upper air men stood gazing upward
ghastly white while women buried their faces in their
hands and wept

   a dull thud was heard at the far side of the infield
and people began to gather there on a run a hole
showed where something had fallen with enough force to
bury itself hurriedly digging they unearthed an oxy-
gen tank one of the tanks that kidwell and dexter had
taken up with them a cry from some people as they
pointed aloft drew thousands of eyes in that direction
fluttering and falling something was coming down
several hands grabbed it as soon as it came within reach
one uttered a cry and let go he held up his hands
in horror they were wet with fresh blood

  a broken and torn part of an aeroplane wing spat-
tered with red blood fell kidwell and the aeroplane
must have been torn to pieces by the demons of the

far upper air and the tank and pieces of the plane scat-
tered over the edge of the floating vegetable island must
have fallen to earth

  another shout and once more all looked aloft the
air was full in all directions with thousands of fluttering
pieces that looked like paper when they fell among
the crowd a shout of surprise went up

  money-money-one dollar bills

  over the ground for miles around the fair grounds
there fell a shower of one dollar bills this was the last
thing ever heard or seen of the two men and the aero-
plane

  afew weeks later pemberton and the president of the
state fair were talking in the presidents office the
president spoke

  i have had two different planes up since kidwell and
dexter were lost the men went armed with shot guns
and prepared for trouble they were unable to find
any upward current of air and they cruised all around
in search of it i am informed though that such a
current would not necessarily always be in the same place
else it might stop altogether just like winds near the
earth i have given up hope of anybody reaching the
scene of the awful tragedy above

  if there ever was an awful tragedy above pember-
ton added the president looked at him in blank sur-
prise

  what

  i say if there ever was an awful tragedy above-if
kidwell and dexter ever did get over two or three
miles high

  what dont you think that kidwell and dexter
were killed by the monsters many miles above the earth
as they described why do you think they werent

  pemberton slowly answered

  i dont know what to think there is  reason for
my doubting the truth of their death miles above the
earth i have gone over it all hundreds of times yet

i	can not make up my mind whether far above float the
remains of two of the bravest men or whether far away
on the earths surface are two of the slickest rascals
that ever lived did what dexter described really hap
pen or did they fly above out of our sight and concoct
the story did they cast down an oxygen tank smear
blood on a piece of plane that they might have taken
with them for the purpose and cast it down to fool us
a small cut on a finger might have furnished the blood
and they might have cast down part of the stolen money
why did only one-dollar bills come down where are
the half-million dollars of large bills they could be
floating far above with the wrecked plane where is the
upward whirlwind still it might have moved or died
out we might have listened to one of the most awful
death struggles or we might have been the victims of on
of the cleverest jokes ever played on the public and
the men escaped with half a million dollars who knowsl
