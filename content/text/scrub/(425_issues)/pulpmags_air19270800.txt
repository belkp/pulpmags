car truck or tractor many have used
it from three to eight years in everyday
actual use and still praise the way it
has saved them gas ended carbon and
spark plug trouble and increased the
power of their cars

  the astounding instant results of the
stransky vaporizer have made big
profits for stransky representatives it
is now one of the few big steady profit

car owner has probably heard about it

  it is easy to install and has nothing

to get out of order it is a simple
piece of metal that fits any oar and is
guaranteed harmless in every way its
principle of saving gasoline is in mul-

hawk

jerry was a fighting fool-he
cracked more crates than any pilot
in the works-but how that bird
could fly

complete air-adventure novelet

this your airport here went on
the stranger

a goodly share of it

well my name is toe lewis and
i can flv anything

modest aint you

not modest he retorted but
good-damned good

we conduct a passenger service i
told him and we cant take any chances
on killing folks but we do need a tiyer
who knows his groceries

then im hired wheres my boat
honest the fellow simply took your
breath away i figured that if he was
half as nervy with an airplane as he was
about asking for a job he might be



tur name smutts

         i admitted it dropping my
feet from my desk to get a good
look at the man who stood in the door-
way facing me the most ungainly the
homeliest most unprepossessing person
i have ever seen-and i look at myself
in the mirror three times a day i
wouldnt take any prizes for beauty
with my dearth of front teeth my two
hundrectand twelve pounds of beef and
my shell-rimmed spectacles i was an
adonis compared to this apparition but
his eyes were sort of squinty and grinny
so that you took a liking to him right
off even if you were a bit chary of
strangers


air stories

good at that but in passenger carry-
ing it isnt nerve so much as good com-
mon-sense that counts in the long run-
always provided that the flyer can fly
i cant because of bum eyes but  m
bugs about ships-and about crime de-
tection queer mixture of hobbies i
admit but they do mix right f requently
according to my way of thinking

  i pushed the fellow out of the door
and led him to the edge of the field
where one of our most dilapidated crates
was being gone over to see if it were
possible to get her off the ground with-
out dynamite this plane might easily
have been called the eye-sore of dutch
flats it was a wreck  but i give my-
self credit for warning lewis before he
climbed into the cockpit

  i dont know you i explained and
good dehavilands cost money if you
smash this one up nobody will cry about
it

  lewis grinned and his fingers played
lovingly over the various instruments
before him you know how some men
are with horses how they talk horse
language and the brutes whinny softly
as though they understood darned if
i didnt think for a moment this fellow
lewis was like that with airplanes
when he eased the old gun into half
speed ahead i thought of a horse
whinnying softly-honest she had a
new sound to her somehow that made
me wonder the aged dehaviland
tugged at the blocks like a two-year-old
at the barrier then lewis cut the gun
and yelled to the mechanic to kick the
blocks no sooner was the mechanic
free than lewis was leaning forward in
the cockpit his face almost out of sight
in a helmet that was too big for him
and the old wreck was sky-hootin down
the field into the teeth of the wind like
a young whirlwind her tail was up in
no time and a long trail of dust was
hurtling backward to scurry across the
avenue behind the hangars into the
faces of passing motorists then lewis
lifted her i looked for him to circle
for altitude but not this guy he knew

he was satisfied in his own mind that
thered be no crash he whirled that
crazy crate in a wing turn that would
have done credit to a little jenny and i
swear the wing-tip didnt clear the
ground more than a foot my hair stood
on end and before he had finished and
set her down again the whole blamed
avenue behind the airport was lined
with automobiles through whose win-
dows necks were craned as curious
passersby stared open-mouthed at the
craziest flying ever seen in san diego
in ten minutes there were more cars on
barnett avenue than there are on
saturday noon on third and broadway

  the old crate behaved nobly back
and forth across the field always too
close to the ground to my mind now on
one wing now on the other with lewis
glued in his cockpit like a leech seeing
nothing knowing nothing except that it
was his job to keep her off the ground
down at the far end of the field he
pointed her blunt old nose at the sky and
lifted her in a zoom that was terrific and
leveled her just as she would have
stalled he turned a wing-tip up there
gave her full speed back toward the air-
port and just before he would have
passed over the avenue yanked his
stick back bringing her nose up again
clear up-up-up-and then back-and
at the peak of his loop with his under-
sized head pointed at the concrete pave-
ment he righted her in a flawless im-
melman turn hot dog id give a
years spending money to be able to do
that bum eyes though-no use whin-
ing but lewis wasnt through yet he
banked sharply turned when right over
the road and plunged straight as a die
toward the office door before which i
was standing he coulqvt miss me 
thought and i jumped one side with a
lot more speed and alacrity than my two
hundred and twelve pounds usually war-
rant just when i thought he would
smack into the little office it occurred to
me that i hadnt thought to warn the girl
inside who takes the money of pas-
sengers too bad wed have to ad-
jerry the hawk



vertise for another girl the old planes
nose lifted just a trifle and it looked to
me as though he had just about ripped
off the office roof

   waited for the sound of his crash
but it didnt come the old dehaviland
came back instead and her trucks were
spinning like mad hed touched them
to the office roof hes about through
now i thought but he flipped over on
his back for all of a hundred yards
righted himself over the road again
banked-and then dove under the tele-
phone wires for a perfect landing

  he cut the gun and was rolling a
cigarette as i reached him

  honest to god lewis i said
youre the looniest flyer ive ever seen 
and youve ruined our passenger busi-
ness too if folks think we have such
fool flyers theyll never ride with us

  no it was a question punctuated
by slightly elevated eyebrows he was
looking back in the direction i had come
and honest injun there were more peo-
ple crowding onto the field than id ever
seen on it before since we started it i
guess i dont know folks after all

  but anyway id given this nut a
name and he was loony lewis from
then on-or just plain loony and
we dated the beginning of our magic
growth as an airport from the moment
he had first stepped into that old wreck
and turned her wrong side out

  lewis grinning all over his homely
face was watching the visitors flock
out upon the field cars were parking
all along the north side of the avenue
and men women and children were run-
ning toward our dehavilands was it
curiosity i wondered or were they
going to ask lewis to do his stuff again 

  i soon found out for in three shakes
the girl in the office who takes in the
coin for our wonder flights over san
diego and environs had used up all of
her five-dollar receipts and every de-
hriland which carried four passengers
was warming up swiftly each with one
of our experienced pilots at the stick
mechanics their greasy faces wreathed

in grins seeing no doubt a possible in-
crease in pay were running hither and
yon like mad bringing out new mov-
able steps upon which passengers were
to mount to the cubbies other mechan-
ics were waiting at the wings to help
the flyers away one after the other
our planes of which there were five in
excellent condition shot down the field
for perfect take-offs rising into the
face of the wind circling for altitude
crossing over to coronado and curving
inland over san diego-and enough
tickets had been sold besides to assure
us that every plane would be busy for
two hours to come for almost the
first time since we had existed as an air-
port we were making more money than
we were paying out

  see said lewis gleefully ive
put some new life into your old air-
port

  your modesty i retorted is over-
whelming

  but i didnt mean it-then i was
overjoyed airplanes are like elephants
when they are idle they eat their heads
off if this new egg could pull stunts
that would make visitors stop look and
listen i was all for him he could brag
about himself to his hearts content

  ryan the airport manager came
striding across to where lewis and i
still stood beside the crazy old crate he
had caused to stand up and beg for
mercy

  fugossakes georgie he cried
what in tarnation has got into folks
all of a sudden  were taking in money
in great gobs

  meet loony lewis i replied
who modestly asserts he can fly player
pianos if you put wings on em

  they shook hands

  i am causing all this flurry in your
little airport says lewis and your
friend smutts has sense enough to
know it if you are as wise as he is
youll see it too-and put me on the
pay-roll at a nice salary

  i saw that ryan didnt like this much
lewis was going too fast for us it


air stories

was almost as though he had suddenly
dropped in and without so much as by-
your-leave taken charge of the place 
ryans voice was a bit cool as he replied
to this last outburst of loony i-ewis

  -youre hired he said but you are
not taking charge of the airport your
salary is the same as that of our ex-
perienced flyers with a ten per cent cut
of all business you bring in

  hot towser retorted lwis
thats the way to talk by the time i
have been here a month this airport
will be famous from san diego to port-
land maine

  its queer replied ryan curiously
that weve never heard of you before
where are you from

  i looked at lewis there was a
peculiar glint in his eyes as he gazed
steadfastly at ryan

  i can fly anything with wings he
replied slowly i take it that is what
you want if you are interested in the
family history of your flyers you might
as weil pay me off now whatever i may
have been before i reported to georgie
smutts is my own damn business i
started new today understand

  ryan nodded stiffly faced about
smartly and returned to the office the
first of the dehavilands dropped back
to the field kicked around toward the
office where the movable steps were
was caught by one wing by a waiting
mechanic and the four passengers their
faces flushed with excitement climbed
out-and they had to force their way
through the crowd that was waiting to
climb in for another hop the other
four dehavilands were scurrying back
two of them high above the field two of
them side-slipping swiftly down the
field was in an uproar dust from
propeller backblasts was whirling across
the avenue behind and more cars were
lining up as cars previously parked drew
away the crowd we had already at-
tracted was attracting other crowds and
the girl who takes the money her hands
full of fivers and her eyes ail nutty with
excitement didnt know exactly which

end she was standing on only the
flyers upon whom so much depended
were at ease they had to be an ac-
cident with such a turn-out as this
would have been ruinous

  listen smutts said loony why
cant  take up a passenger or two in
this old crate shell hold together

  i gave him a fishy stare took him by
the arm and led him toward the office
just as the four other dehavilands
circled about and began to discharge
their passengers

  listen loony i told him stunt
flying is all right when you dont risk
anybodys neck but your own we want
to look you over for a few days before
we let you carry passengers we are
in business you know and we cant take
chances

  you know georgie he said i
have an idea that ryan doesnt especially
like me

  ryan i replied is not a fellow
who shoots off his mouth and he can
fly rings around any flyer i have ever
seen-not excepting myself he has his
doubts about folks who say i too
much

  this stopped loony for a moment-
during which i took the opportunity to
tell him what we expected of him he
nodded and darted to the hangars for
dungarees those he found were too
large for him  but no one seemed to
notice and lewis who appeared to
know everything about airplanes was
soon doing the work of two mechanics
making himself generally useful and
doing it all as though he enjoyed it
thoroughly

  we counted cash after it had got too
dark to fly and for the first time in our
experience had to use an adding ma-
chine wed certainly knocked em for
a loop-and tomorrow would be satur-
day when everybody goes out for a
good time

  in our excitement we had practically
forgotten loony lewis

  came saturday morning-but loony
lewis did not appear eight oclock
jerry the hawk



nine ten eleven noon but no lewis

  at about one-thirty the first of the
saturday afternoon crowd was en-
tering the field but the crowd was
small compared to the crowd which had
still been on the field yesterday when it
had become so dark we had been com-
pelled to knock off flying then break-
ing all speed limits there dashed along
the avenue an orange taxicab with two
passengers one of them was loony
lewis the other was a stranger-and
i didnt like his looks lewis remained
in the cab talking to this fellow while
the wreck he had flown yesterday was
being warmed up cars were drawing
in and parking with greater frequency
now so that i didnt pay too much at-
tention to lewis and his doubtful
friend

  i heard a dehaviland break into song
far down the line i looked up the
orange taxicab still stood at the curb
with lewis friend in the rear seat alone
his eyes fixed intently on our string of
waiting ships i looked down the line
craning my neck lewis was in the
cockpit of the old wreck and a mechanic
was on the wing-and even that far
away i saw that the mechanic looked
worried lewis cut the gun and shouted
to the mechanic who kicked out the
blocks under the trucks this was too
much for me lewis was taking off
without orders and without permission
i ran down the line calling to him but
he was half way down the field the old
wrecks tail already in the air when i
reached the mechanic who had waited
on him

  what the hell jones i said to the
mechanic

  hes drunk as a lord mr smutts
said the mechanic but he wouldnt
listen to me

  what to do there was nothing we
ceuld do it would never do to let the
crowd know that a drunken flyer had
just taken to the air from our joint and
that he would be up there doing his
stuff when the five dehavilands which
already were being loaded took off later

there was nothing to do but sit tight
and pray that nothing would happen

  loony lewis was certainly doing his
stuff he was all of four thousand feet
in the air doing wing-turns barrel rolls
nose dives falling leaves immelman
turns-everything in the way of stunt-
ing that aviation has evolved straight
ahead with the speed of a hurricane
then he would bring her nose up and
over and fly straight back up side down
stunt that drunken flyer certainly
could do his stuff-and did it any
minute i looked for a wing to fall off
the old crate but minute succeeded
minute with monotonous regularity and
the old bus remained in the air from
where i watched it looked as though
lewis were doing his stuff right above
san diego and i knew that wed get
called good for permitting it i might
be mistaken of course on account of
my bum eyes but even above the har-
bor it wasnt entirely wise to stunt for
the fleet was in and somebody besides
the crazy flyer might get killed

  ten minutes passed with loony turn-
ing the old buggy inside out as usual
but the crowd was coming in even big-
ger than yesterday and i decided that
lewis wouldnt crash any more gently
if i worried about him so i turned away
and got busy with our customers at
intervals though i looked over my
shoulder at the stunting plane-which
even when new was never made for the
treatment it was receiving

  the five dehavilands were in the air
now and as though we had given the
navy and marine corps flyers an idea
seven hydroplanes took off from north
island while four shiny de hs bear-
ing the devices of the marine corps
aviation group lifted into the air like
so many birds there were entirely too
many planes in the air for a boozy flyer
as crazy as lewis to be doing his stuff
but i didnt tell ryan yet ryans
heart was wrapped up in the airport
and all this excitement was doing him
a world of good i couldnt rob him
of his sudden triumph after all the
i

air stories

years of failure through which  knew
he had gone for myself it was dif-
ferent ive got money even though a
dead man gave it to me and if the
whole airport went up in smoke tomor-
row i could build another one in its
place but ryan was sensitive about
taking money even from his friends so
i held my peace and said nothing about
lewis though i kept my eye peeled on
that part of the sky which he was tear-
ing into pieces

  eighteen planes in the air at once
and what an uproar hot dog if we
hadnt been so busy taking in money id
have had my own pet pilot busy and
been up there among them myself

  i heard a gasp behind me i turned
and looked at the spot where i had last
seen lewis the old wreck he was fly-
ing was right above the airport perhaps
three thousand feet in altitude and her
nose was pointed straight toward the
center of the landing field and she was
plummeting downward at the rate of two
hundred miles an hour that sounds
like an exaggeration maybe but it
wouldnt sound like it if you had been
there and even from tliat distance heard
the whizzing of the wind through the
struts and braces of that old sky-buggy
wliich appeared to be plunging to earth
out of control i looked about for the
orange taxicab and its mysterious occu-
pant but it had departed i looked back
at the falling plane the people on the
field were running back toward the
avenue back from the spot where it
looked as though lewis were going to
crash he must have been angling more
than i had thought for his nose was
pointed at a spot some hundred yards in
advance of the blocks which lay on the
field in readiness for chocking the
truck of die passenger planes as they
came back lewis brought up her nose
when he was about a hundred and fifty
feet from the ground and twisted her
around so that she pointed into the
west into the wind from ocean beach
i groaned and winced-and watched for
the wings to drop off god knows how

the old wreck ever hung together for

such treatment but lewis set her down
as nice as ryan could have done gave
her the gun for the turn slowed down
for the mechanic who darted onto the
field to catch the wing and swung
grandly into place in the act of run-
ning her out lewis head sagged against
the cowling and the mechanic stepped
into the footrests in time to hide lewis
from the crowd i ran to the plane

  iewis his crazy flight successfully
completed had passed out he even
snored when i caught him by the hair
and shook him savagely ryan was run-
ning toward us i waved him back but
he came on keeping my eye on ryan
i shook lewis again pulling out a bit
of his hair i knew however that not
one of our visitors had noticed what had
happened

  a flyer drunk dead drunk had
passed out at the joy-stick after twenty
minutes of savage stunting

  ryan was quite close to us i felt
lewis stir under my hand i shook him
again he sat up stiffly as ryan came
alongside and i swear that his voice
was perfectly normal as he addressed
the airport manager

  that straight goods about the ten
per cent cut on business i bring in mr
ryan he demanded if it is i have
an idea i got it while i was doing my
stuff up there the navy is going to
do some formation flying next week
with parachute jumps and all the rest
of it lets mimic every formation
with our six planes only lets do it bet-
ter than the navy does ill lead the
formation-and later ill do a parachute
jump from ten thousand feet

  for a moment not one of us had a
word to say

        chapter ii
        scraping the sky

  it didnt take a very wise guy to see
that ryan wras a bit doubtful of this
fellow lewis lewis talked too much
jerry die hawk



for one tiling and didnt seem to care a
tinkers dam whether he crashed with a
plane or not hed been up twice in
our worst wreck had done everything
to her except take the wings off in the
air and hadnt carried a parachute
either time looked like he wanted to
commit suicide and was just waiting for
the proper moment ryan was worried
about our new employee though he
liated to let him go when every man
jack of us at the airport knew blamed
well that the aerial antics of lewis had
given us two days of the richest busi-
ness we had ever had but ryan
watched lewis continually i knew too
that he was cogitating on that matter
of formation flying with our civilian
planes and that he rather cottoned to
the idea it wouldnt be difficult for our
flyers most of them had been service
flyers during and after the great war
and a single test flight in formation
would fix them up all right while
ryan was mulling it over in his mind
i since i knew that ryan would
finally approve the plan was promising
myself that id somehow find a place in
the formation for georgie smutts i
have to take a back seat when it comes
to flying but i have no intention of
taking a seat too far back-no farther
back than the after cockpit if i can help
it unofficial observer thats me
georgie smutts

  ryan i knew had been an instruc-
tor at mather field during the war and
knew his stuff he had been a flying
major one of the youngest in the army
and serving on what i have alyvays be-
lieved to be the most trying and dis-
heartening of jobs-pilot instructor
passing on the eligibility of young men
who had the idea they could fly or could
learn personally i have no desire to
take the first hop with any flyer im
nervous enough with a flyer who has
hundreds of hours in the air to his
credit ryan had won his spurs in more
ways than one two days after loony
lewis had made his proposal ryan
called all the flyers into my office which

is just as much his as mine and bluntly
informed them that lewis plan would
be put into effect-and that lewis would
make that parachute jump about which
he had spoken there was something
of a challenge in ryans eyes as he
looked at loony after making this state-
ment as though he half expected loony
to back out but lewis grinned he
didnt even nod his head ryan watch-
ing him carefully paled suddenly and
leaned forward staring into the myste-
rious pilots face

  look here lewis he said sud-
denly havent you and i met some-
place before

  maybe replied lewis ive been
there-several times

  there was an insult not particularly
veiled in the reply-much more of an
insult than the words would indicate
ryan goaded in some way that i could
not understand continued

  and if memory serves me right your
name wasnt lewis then

  lewis grinned the other flyers
shifted uneasily for in the space of four
days the loony flyer had become a fa-
vorite with all of us he was a man
after our own hearts because he could
fly rings around the best of us

  still wondering about my family
history ryan said lewis at length
cheese it im making this blasted
field of yours im earning all you pay
me ten times over even with that ten
percent cut youre giving me

  ryan breathed loudly through his
nose as he leaned back it appeared a
real effort for ryan to draw his eyes
away from the homely face of loony
lewis but he managed it after a time
though at intervals his eyes came back
to the tanned face of the stunt flyer
and each time tliis happened thoughtful
lines appeared about his eyes ryan
with success in his grasp was existing
under a terrific strain and showed it
the mystery of lewis bothered him
and even the general run of flyers are
enigmas to other folks as hard to han-
dle as a bunch of high salaried actresses


air stories

-temperamental superstitious and all
that i wasnt worried everything
seemed to be going swimmingly as far
as i could see

  ryan with his forehead still wrinkled
plunged into the details of the flight over
san diego we intended to make the
flyers listened attentively they knew
that ryan knew his onions and that
what he said was flyers gospel as far
as the airport was concerned

  therell be six planes of us boys
he said counting that wreck lewis has
been flying the last four days-if it is
still together then haley will lead the
squadron ill be farther back with an
observer watching progress well fly
over san diego twice over coronado
over the three pleasure beaches with
two shifts in our formation the shifts
will occur when we are over the open
country north of the biological gardens
where if there should be an accident
we wont kill anyone except ourselves
the shifts will be dangerous as you all
know but men remember one thing
-if anything goes wrong dive
dont nose up when you know there is a
plane somewhere on your blind side and
hold onto your places in the formation
as though your life depended on it-
which it very well may well break
formation at my signal ill be well
back after we have finished our stuff
and when i drop out of the formation
you will separate and fly back to the air-
port singly is that understood

  the flyers nodded

  there was a lot more of it the dope
on where each man belonged in the
formation and all that stuff im no
aerial strategist i just like to fly most
of what ryan told the flyers was greek
to me but they all got it even to the
army air service terms ryan used

  now-lewis and none of us liked
the way ryan paused over the name
for your part of the show you say
youll drop from ten thousand feet
have you got nerve enough to jump
right over the airport and try to land
somewhere near the line where the

planes stand when we are waiting for

passengers 

i hope said lewis slowly that
you liave no doubt about my nerve-or

my ability 

 but ryan shrugging made no
answer something deep here some-
thing hidden it made us all feel un-
easy it was the girl who takes the
money of the passengers who snapped us
all out of it

  are we open for business today or
aint we  she asked cockily the field
is full of tourists and a self-appointed
spellbinder is telling em all that weve
got a flyer here who is a world-beater as
a stunt flyer i sold a bunch of tickets
shall i tell the crowd to get its money
at the box-office or will you flyin
gentlemen come on out and do your
stuff

  that broke up the party and relieved
the tension the flyers donning helmets
and goggles swarmed from the office
led by ryan himself with lewis tailing
them all did i fancy it or was there
a new somehow appalling expression in
the face of loony lewis as he gazed
after ryan im a peacemaker myself
and then and there determined that be-
fore that formation business was under-
taken id find out what was wrong be-
tween ryan and lewis

  the roaring of the dehavilands in-
terrupted my peacemaking thoughts i
went to the door and watched the girl
take in money with one eye while with
the other i watched our sweet-singing
babies take the air as though they were
natural birds instead of made-to-order
ones ryan didnt go up his head was
full of plans for publicity the airport
could stand a lot of it for airports cost
money when the whole five planes
were in the air and the sixth with
lewis in the cockpit was tearing quee
shaped hunks out of the sky ryan
walked thoughtfully to where i was
nonchalantly standing

  weve got to have a talk with
lewis he said without preamble hes
got me worried ive seen him some-
jerry the hawk



where before but liis name wasnt
lewis then-unless my memory is hor-
ribly at fault and the mechanic we
assigned to his crate that jones fellow
just told me that lewis was drunk the
other day when he did all those stunts
just before diving nospforemost into the
field you saw him smutts why
didnt you tell me

  wait a minute big boy i retorted
i hate to remind you of any tiling like
this but remember that you need my
money to rim this airport and that i
own more of it than you do legally dont
use that tone to me i like you ryan and
would give you every darned one of my
shirts with the cuff buttons thrown in 
but i wont take a bawling out from you
or anything that even remotely sounds
like a bawling out now dont get heavy
boy before you have a chance to cool
down go on away without saying the
nasty things you are opening your
mouth to say and well forget that i
have for once exercised my prerogative
and done something on my own hook
ill answer for lewis for the time
being

  ryan closed his lips tightly finally
after staring at me red-eyed for a
moment he managed a stiff grin

  anyway georgie he managed i
want another talk with lewis lets
have him in just you and me after
quitting time tonight and well see
whats what

  and id like to wager right now
don i said gently diat when we are
through talking you and lewis will have
shaken hands and called each other a
couple of fools for trying to start a
mares nest of some kind

 but ryan was gone on the run
toward the big douglas which the me-
chanics were just wheeling out since
the night when i had made a spectacular
ride in her toward tecate a lot of things
had been done to her so that even ryan
was satisfied that she was all right to
risk as a passenger carrier ryan in-
tended flying her himself with the
youngest of our pilots beside him the

douglas carries two pilots and twelve
passengers i wondered what the crowd
would think of taking a maiden hop in
her-sixty dollars worth for each hop
but i neednt have worried at the
stick ryan is truly himself and his in-
fectious grin won the crowd over so
that the cubby was full before the en-
gines had been entirely warmed up for
the hop i breathed a sigh of relief
when the passengers securely fastened
in the douglas went trundling down the
field for a perfect take-off and fifteen
minutes later an even more perfect
landing

  in the meantime lewis had done his
stuff landed run her out and joined me
in the office door while the big douglas
was dropping into the field to complete
her maiden voyage with capacity load
lewis watched her with varying emo-
tions visible in his face i saw hunger
there among othe things and i knew
that his fingers fairly itched to grasp the
joy stick of the big crate at the same
time by some sixth sense i didnt know
i had before i knew that hed never go
up in it with ryan as his side-kick but
it was too deep for me

  id make em shake hands though
peacemaker georgie smutts

  if i could only have looked ahead to
that meeting after quitting time

  it was a big day the three days
preceding had been big days chock-full
of business but with the big douglas in
operation this fourth day of lewis join-
ing on was bigger than the other three
put together and ryan looked almost
happy as he strode into the office for the
chinfest with loony lewis and me

  a sort of tableau with a bit of
dynamite in it i knew that as soon as
we were seated for the seance but only
the lord himself realized how soon the
explosion was to occur

  i started it myself

  i waxed facetious

  don ryan manager of the dutch
flats airport i began shake hands
with loony lewis the craziest ftyer that
ever flew


air stories

  ryan automatically put forth his

hand

   and the fun started

  lewis leaned forward and the most
savage expression i have ever seen on a
mans face blazed from his as he gazed
into the eyes of ryan

  shake hands with ryan he ex-
ploded not if he was the last man on
earth besides me id rather smash him
between the eyes i might as well give
you the works now ryan since you
have already committed yourself in such
a way that you cant back out gracefully
when you know the story i can tell you
said you had seen me somewhere before
-you have you said my name wasnt
lewis then-it wasnt does the name
of jess bogart mean anything to you
have you ever heard it before

  ryan seemed to crumple in upon him-
self for the first time since i had
known him he seemed shaken his face
looked as though he had seen a ghost-
and he stared at lewis as though lewis
himself were that ghost

  jess bogart he muttered jess
bogart let me see-i foimd you un-
qualified didnt i

  you did damn you and i could
fly rings around you the best day you
ever saw you ruined me ryan thats
what you did you were a power on
that instructor job of yours and a word
from you sent me away from mather
field in disgrace you told our superiors
that id never be a flyer-and made me
go through the whole damned war as an
infantryman i stunk and was lousy
with the men in the trenches while every
day i had to look up and watch poorer
flyers than myself get theirs over the
lines there was gale irvine for
example i could outfly him any day
but you told the colonel differently and
irvine came back from france a major
with three decorations two of them
from his own country i came out as a
sergeant when i might have ranked
above irvine you didnt have the guts
yourself ryan you took the stick
away from me because you thought i

was diving too steep-and told the
colonel i had lost my nerve and froze
onto the damned thing  had a three-
point landing all mapped out in my mind
-and ive made a thousand of them
since you broke me ive made em right
on this field of yours-one of them when
i was so drunk i couldnt hit the ground
with my hat to say nothing of hitting it
with that old wreck smutts gave me to
kill myself in

  youre wrong lewis said ryan
quietly and he was himself again i
had you sent down because i knew you
drank too much

  i breathed a sigh of relief i liked
ryan too well to harbor the belief that
he would be capable of doing a brother
flyer an injustice

  but lewis whose hate whose desire
for revenge had been smoldering
through the war and the monotonous
years that had followed was not to be
pacified so easily

  ryan he said softly-too softly i

knew at once you are a - liarl

i told you at mather field that i would
get you some day and im going to do
it the best thing you can do is fire
me-and ill tell the papers why you
did it that fellow in the taxicab with
me the other day was a snoopy reporter
and while i was drunk i let out a little
of the story just enough to whet his
interest and hell write our story all
over the front pages if i give him the
word im going to make this airport
the greatest in the country-and then
im going to bust it flatter than a pan-
cake and you along with it ill let you
taste success such as you never dreamed
of and then im going to take the cup
away

  here were two challenges and i held
my breath as i wondered how ryan
would react to them lewis had called
ryan a blankety-blank liar-and
dared him to either fire or keep him at
the airport threatening to break him
whatever he did i dont believe ryan
really heard all that lewis said or that
lewis himself really knew what hi
jerry the hawk



mouth was saying-for both men were
peeling off their flying coats and their
helmets with maddening inevitable de-
liberation i remonstrated with them
all to no avail neither heard me i
ran to the office and looked out the
whole airport was deserted i closed
and locked the door i grasped a chair
by the back and held it before me like a
shield i dont like fights and intended
to hit whichever one of em mistook me
for the other one when they got going

  i dont remember which one struck
first i only know that before i could
say jack robinson lewis had caught
the desk by the edge and upset it with
its top against the office wall then
lewis and ryan were at it-in brutal
bitter silence

  neither spoke a word after the first
blow was struck the two damned fools
stood toe to toe where the desk had been
and smashed each other in the face with
both fists and neither pulled his blows
nor gave ground i stood my ground
nobly with my back to the door and the
legs of the chair sticking straight out in
front of me-for all of five minutes
lewis went crashing into the opposite
wall from a blow to the button delivered
with all the power in ryans right arm
he came back staggering ryan stepped
aside and lewis came on butting his
thin tummy against the chair legs i
guess he thought i was ryan for he
swung like a pile driver i dont know
just what happened to the chair when
i woke up with my head against the end
of the desk the chair was across the
room from me with two of the legs
broken off-and those two fools were
flailing the tar out of each other in the
center of the office they were both
breathing like porpoises now-or what-
ever animal or fish it is that breathes like
that-and their faces looked like
pounded beefsteaks their knees were
trembling too and their blows lacked
steam so t must have been out for some
time i felt of my mouth to see how
many teeth lewis had knocked down
my throat i gulped with dismay then

i remembered that i didnt have any
teeth to get knocked out-id lost em
all in a crash some months before

  ryan went down from a savage blow
in the mouth he came up swearing
fiercely and lewis went down with a
blow on the chin sweet papa  a pair of
sweet sockers and nobody to see the fight
but me and i had missed perliaps the
best part of it because of a lazy desire
to go to sleep under the overturned desk

  meat and bone couldnt stand the gaff
every time a blow landed somebody
groaned five more minutes passed
while the pair clinched blocked and
slugged at the end of that time when
a blow struck there were two groans in
unison-it was hurting the fellow who
slugged as badly as the fellow who got
slugged or even worse

  cheese it you guys i croaked
the cops are coming

  but it didnt work they never even
heard me and there werent an cops
that wasnt much of a bluff of mine
apparently for the saps kept on fighting
though i fat as i am could have taken
the hardest blow either could have landed
and cried like a spoiled baby for more

  lewis stepped back and let drive all
his power it wouldnt have killed a
fly but ryan dropped like a poled beef
and lewis swaying on his feet drunk-
enly stood over him waiting for him
to get up ryan staggered erect after
i could have counted twenty nice and
slow and pasted lewis again lewis
went down there was to be no count-
ing in this fight theyd keep at it until
one of em went down and stayed down
or until one of em said nut but i
knew as i saw the hate which gleamed
in their eyes that neither would give up
lewis came up again and swung ryan
dropped i looked at him curiously he
rolled to his back and lay still lewis
looked down at him through puffed lids
he opened his mouth to speak but
changed his mind and spat blood and
three teeth all over the place

  bravely then i stepped forward
heading for the water faucet lewis


air stories

hand went up weakly to bar my way i

shoved him back roughly forgetting
that he staggered so tiredly he fell
and rolled over

  that i said loudly just in case
someone happened to look in the win-
dow at the moment is what you two
guys get for fooling with me serves
you right lewis for hitting me with a
chair when my back was turned

  i almost drowned ryan with cold
water he came up sputtering spitting
blood and two teeth and thought i was
lewis i ducked under his feeble swing
seized him under the arms and placed
him in a chair from which place he
stared stupidly at lewis still on the
floor

  knocked him out hey he mut-
tered knew i could whip the dashed
fool

  i didnt say anything i got some
water and threw it in lewis face he
came out of it but didnt take me for
ryan i put him in another chair i had
brought from the girls office and
righted the desk between them then i
got what was left of the chair i had
used as a shield and raised it over my
shoulder threateningly

   therell be no more fighting tonight
gents i said savagely bravely unless
i do the fighting

  they didnt even look at me

  they looked at each other like a
couple of wildcats though neither could
have moved on his own power

  break me and be damned to you
said ryan at last to lewis ill show
you what i think of you and your
threats you fly the douglas tomorrow
with passengers and with haley as a
seat-mate and your pay is raised ten
dollars a day-provided youve got
brass enough to do that jump you
bragged you would do you havent got
the guts to break me

  lewis was grinning bloodily but hate
was just as evident in his eyes as before
as he replied

  i said you were a liar a while ago-
and youre still a liar

   get it

  things were going to be strained

around this airport from now on even
i could see that and neither of these
guys would yell nuf

chapter iii
cloud battle

that was a strained week what i
mean loony flew the douglas
with haley as his seat-mate and he
played the game no stunting this
week but the crowds turned out just
the same as though they thought there
might be some stunting ryan and
lewis avoided each other and their
eyes carried veiled insults whenever they
happened to clash-and lewis didnt
help matters any when he insisted on
drawing his pay at the end of each day
as though he didnt trust ryan to come
through if he left it too long dark lines
were already appearing under the eyes
of either and even our oldest flyers were
beginning to get a bit stiained-snarled
at one another without the slightest
excuse not at all the feeling there
should have been among us with the
formation flying but a few days off but
what to do these two birds would
never yell nuf either of them

  during the week casually in such a
way that not even the snoopiest report-
ers caught on we managed to get all six
planes in the air at once and practised
the formations for a few minutes at a
time breaking when even one automo-
bile on the camp kearney road came
to halt to watch

  silence and bitterness two words
that describe the atmosphere of the air-
port on dutch flats it was hard to
figure out seemed to me that ryan
could have rid himself of lewis had he
so desired without hanging him about
his ryans own neck like an old man of
the sea hard to figure flyers are and
ryan was just about as nutty as the
next one a queer sort of pride had
dictated his action in the lewis matter
jerry the hawk



and everyone of us knew that hell nor
high tide would change his mind

  the time for the publicity stunts wa
drawing close enough to suit everybody
-except me i didnt sleep well i
dreamed of airplanes falling in flames
of collisions in midair and airplanes
plummeting downward with locked
horns of men quitting after cockpits
head first fingers in the ring of the rip-
cord-and the chutes failing to open
once and ill never forget it i dreamed
of taking a jump myself in the dream
my chute failed to open until i was fifty
feet from the ground and the blow i
struck old terra firma drove my fat
legs clean up into my fat stomach all
of which didnt help my peace of mind
to any great extent

  then the day came they always do
and they come a darned sight faster
when you dread them

  i have always believed that the public
must have had a womans intuition all
along for all san diego seemed to be
sleepwalking with eyes distended as
though everybody waited for the explo-
sion of some vast powder magazine
planted directly under fourth and
broadway imagination i guess most
of it but deucedly unpleasant

  the navy planes took off first-big
seaplanes that looked like flying
elephants and made so much noise you
couldnt hear yourself think about nine
of em there were at first circling over
coronado until they all got together
then in formation giving san diego a
treat and an eyeful a reporter on one
of the papers must have had a lot of
drag somewhere for a morning paper
carried a full page spread of the sea-
planes in flight and every plane was
right in place as though their location
in the formation had been decided by
micrometer a remarkable picture
oddly like that of a flock of thorough-
breds coming down the stretch in a dead
heat theyve still got that picture in
the morgue for i saw it again the other
day

  and racket the automobiles which

scurried along barnett avenue didnt
make a sound and some of those big
cars had engines in em that would have
pulled the marine base off its base you
couldnt hear anything but those amphi-
bians flying just above the limit pre-
scribed by law

  then the flyers from the marine
aviation group took oft with the sun
glinting gloriously from the sheeny
polished wings i was watching from
dutch flats and my heart bounded
even that far away i fancied i could
see the ace of spades on their wrings
the symbol of the group hot towser
what a show dehavilands running
wide open in perfect formation i
looked at our six planes waiting at the
blocks like racehorses at the barrier and
my heart flopped again nothing showy
about us peeling fabric though ser-
viceable-planes that were really too old
for service but that were serviceable
because of the love and solicitude of
the man who had to succeed don ryan
manager of the airport

  the service planes held the stage so
to speak for an hour or more-perfect
flying then over coronado after the
seaplanes had dropped to the bay and
the marine flyers had broken formation
four black specks dropped from four
planes at about the same altitude and
started earthward somersaulting over
and over from the back of one of
them darted a white spurt of smoke
which spread out to become a rigid
umbrella with the jumper oscillating
back and forth beneath twro other
chutes opened with swinging parachute
jumpers safely anchored among the
shrouds one still shot earthward
gaining speed somersaulting still i held
my breath that would be atherton i
told myself with his finger hooked in
the ring staying his hand to give the
watching crowds their moneys worth
he had almost reached the tops of the
houses in coronado it looked to me
when his chute opened and held him
my muscles twitched in sympathy he
must have fallen all of a thousand feet


air stories

i had never done it but i knew some-
thing of what that drop had meant to
atherton when the chute opened-im a
good listener wherever flyers foregather

  then that first jumper brought a gasp
of horror to my lips hed slipped out
of his chute somehow and the thing
like a white shroud was settling slowly
earthward empty how had it hap-
pened  i knew though when a second
chute opened over his head that he had
had two of em that guy must have
been atherton heres hoping he al-
ways has an extra chute in reserve

  came an excited shout from ryan
our six flyers were already in their
cockpits except for ryan and all
propellers were whirling-though i
hadnt heard them until now i was to
fly with haley i was all ready i
fastened the flaps of my helmet as i
raced for my plane and pulled my
goggles over my eyes inside my cock-
pit with haley grinning back at me i
adjusted the straps of my parachute to
my corpulent self with the mental note

  i wont need this-but ill adjust it
anyway

  it was a kind of prayer i guess

  the flyers had been well rehearsed
ryan raised his hand blocks were
kicked out and regular as one two
three the six planes darted down the
field into the wind and pointed their
blunt noses at the sky each climbing
swiftly to be free of those yet to follow
almost before i knew it haley and i
were in the air and circling the field
at three thousand feet i didnt know
the signals wasnt even watching for
them but i did see our planes converge
at four thousand altitude and my ear-
drums seemed ready to burst with the
concerted roar from right and left
the planes darted in and as each took
its place i closed my eyes and held my
breath and kept my finger in the ring
of the ripcord-though i told myself
that nothing less than a fire in the air
would make me jump but there were
no collisions our flyers knew their
stuff they grinned at one another

across chasms that made me sick and
faint and we proceeded to do our stuff
over san diego and coronado i could
imagine how the watchers must have
laughed at us and our antiquated planes
-but i knew that they were watching
us nevertheless which was the main
thing

  loony lewis was somewhere in the
middle of the formation and his head
was bent low over the cowling he was
all business i wondered what he was
thinking ryan was right across to the
left of me and every once in so often i
saw him look at lewis plane intently
as though wondering just what his
sworn enemy would do but i told my-
self much as these two guys hated each
other neither would do anything that
would put the rest of us in danger out
of nowhere as this thought came came
another one-a memory of that tense
moment in the office when with all the
flyers assembled ryan had practically
dared lewis to do his stuff but it was
not the dare i remembered it was the
words ryan had used when he was giv-
ing instructions to his flyers and the
peculiar emphasis he had put upon the
words

  if anything goes ivrong dive

  was it a sort of premonition  maybe
i dont know flyers are queer folks
if i havent mentioned it before and
even i am a flyer after a fashion that
single sentence with much mental
repetition and mulling over began to
take on a queer significance i was be-
ginning to wish i hadnt taken off and
praying to be back in my own cubby on
dutch flats-and couldnt have ex-
plained my hunch to save me

  we made the first shift north of the
botanical gardens over the mesa
stretching between san diego and camp
kearney without mishap and came back
over the town which at this time ws a
regular anthill of activity and i guess
a bunch of other folks must have had a
hunch for the escondido road was
lined with parked cars when we circled
back for the next shift-after which we
jerry the hawk



were to break and lewis was to climb
to ten thousand turn over control to the
man in his after cockpit and do a nose
dive of his own

  ryan or somebody must have been
doping off when we had all but finished
our stuff somehow he got out of the
formation saw that he had muffed one
of his own signal or something and
banking came back like a whirlwind
but the formation had shifted according
to schedule and he had to cross right
over lewis to get to his own place-a
combination of fatal errors as we all
knew in about two shakes nobody
later could explain exactly how it had
happened but everybody agreed that
ryan had missed his cue somehow-and
lewis proceeded to gum the works com-
pletely i saw him look around wildly
for ryan saw him stare for a second at
the hole in the formation where ryan
should have been-and then nose his
plane up sharply for a better view
ryan coming across like a hurricane
was on his blind side for a split second
-just that split second too long i
shouted and my words choked me the
other flyers grasping what had hap-
pened slipped away to right and left
as though at a signal as the nose of
ryans plane struck lewis bus just for-
ward of the forward cockpit-and even
above the roaring of the motors i could
hear the crash as the planes seemed to
melt together they hung like that for
what seemed an hour then shot earth-
ward still glued together three of the
planes were winging back toward dutch
flats and i knew that an ambulance
would be on the mesa to pick up the
pieces almost as soon as they had struck
the two planes were falling toward the
escondido road and the sagebrush was
suddenly black with darting figures as
the parked cars along the right of way
vomited forth their fleeing occupants
the planes turned sidewise and in the
cockpits of lewis plane i saw two
figures seize their opportunity and som-
ersault over the side lewis and his
mechanic were safe apparently for one

   a-s-aug-

parachute opened almost at once with
the jumper miraculously free of the
falling planes-which now proceeded to
separate with sickening slowness falling
apart on the downward plunge discard-
ing bits of metal and fabric neither of
the men in ryans plane had apparently
been able to jump

  then it suddenly occurred to me that
my own plane was getting to earth with
terrifying speed i hadnt noticed it
before call me a liar if you feel like
it but i wasnt in any airplane some-
thing must have made me do it i guess
i know if i had stopped to think id
have glued myself to my plane so that i
couldnt have been pried loose with a
crowbar but here i was plunging
headfirst toward the place where those
two planes would crash and hadnt even
pulled the ripcord i swear i was
fairly cool though i have no explana-
tion of the phenomenon but i was a lot
cooler when that parachute went slatting
out over my head and my downward
plunge slackened with gratifying sure-
ness as i say i cant explain it i
dont even remember jumping-but its
a good thing for georgie smutts that i
came to before i hit terra firma maybe
i thought more of ryan than i have
let on

  but i had time to think a little now
for the crash had happened at five thou
sand feet ryan was still alive for i
could see him fighting the useless con-
trols his mechanic jumped after a bit
but he must have been dazed for he
never pulled the ripcord and i closed
my eyes and strove to keep from retch-
ing as he beat his own plane to the con
crete pavement which is the escondido
road theyd need a blotter for him
poor chap a fellow who was crazy
about planes and ftying and who was
slated to do his first solo within the
next few days oh well-

  it takes time to tell but it happened
in a dozen bats of an eyelash

  i looked around for lewis i didnt
have to look far he was below me
and i could tell by the movements of


air stories

his white parasol that he was pulling

down on his shrouds to spill the wind
out of her so that hed reach the ground
with all speed he was taking desperate
chances and even i knew that he was
striving to get down to be right on hand
at the wreck as soon as possible i tried
the same stunt but my nerve isnt so
good i couldnt stand the way every-
thing dropped out from under me when
i pulled down on the shrouds and
spilled the wind from my chute i sat-
isfied myself by holding on and letting
nature take her course at that i soon
saw i wouldnt be so darn far from the
wreck when she finally hit-if she was
ever going to she seemed to sing with
maddening slowness which after all
may have been in ryans favor it was
plain that he had no intention of jump-
ing some flyers are that way ive
heard some of em say that before theyd
take to the chute theyd ride down on
the propeller

  lewis empty plane hit first and
scattered all over the place lewis him-
self wasnt far behind then ryans
plane hovered for an instant slipped to
the right and crashed alongside the road
on its right wing-

  and instantly took fire

  i swear that lewis dropped that last
hundred feet and that he was free of
his chute when he hit the ground thats
absurd of course as i look back at the
whole affair but im giving you my
impressions at the moment thats the
way it looked to me the spectators
who had fled when the planes started
down were coming back but they were
keeping well back from that inferno
about ryans dehaviland theres sel-
dom any guts in a crowd or maybe
youve noticed it

  lewis when i spotted him again was
racing toward ryans wrecked plane i
gave a lonely cheer for him but no one
looked up at me though i was getting
closer as the moments sped then i
gulped and gasped-for lewis reach-
ing the plane never hesitated once the
fire couldnt have been as bad as i had

thought for lewis went right into wnai

looked like the worst of it vanishing
instantly from sight then i struck the
pavement-and didnt know until a half
hour later that the impact had thrice
flattened my already flat feet i dont
remember getting free of my chute i
do remember that the sky seemed all at
once to be darkened with airplanes
which had dashed to the scene from no-
where and were circling the scene
madly its a wonder there werent a
couple more crashes

  i ran toward ryans plane just as
lewis looking like the devil himself
black of face as the ace of spades which
is the emblem of the marine aviation
group came out of the smoke dragging
ryan limply after him i ran forward
to help lewis and the damned fool his
wrhite teeth showing in a snarl between
blackened lips smashed me right in my
already badly maltreated mouth knock-
ing me on my posterior in the dirt can
you beat it and all i wanted to do
was help him right then and there i
promised myself that some day id get
even with loony lewis he was crazy
as a bedbug but i guess there was some
excuse for his madness at that

  he kept on dragging ryan away the
crowd which had come close now that
there was no need suddenly gave back
with a concerted yell of terror just as
the whole darned plane vanished in a
roar of flame lewis hadnt been a
moment too soon

  lewis didnt look back at the plane
ryan had been dragged free lewis
dropped him limply in the dirt and
knelt beside him i jumped to my feet
groggily and ran toward them i hadnt
any idea what i intended to do but i
did know that i didnt like what lewis
was doing for he had raised ryan to
a sitting position had hurled his enemys
helmet aside and was slapping ryan on
either cheek with savage stinging blows
one man in all that crowd did display a
bit of sense he must have been a
farmer from the distant mountains be-
yond escondido out warner hot

springs way for he had a water bag on
his car and he ran to get it he brought
it to lewis pulling the cork as he ran--
and lewis spilled about half of the
water on ryans face and then forced
the rim between ryans tight-clenched
teeth

  i began to understand then i al-
ways do after everybody else has
grasped the grand idea ryan opened
his eyes-and struck feebly at lewis
blackened face

  damn you lewis he managed
weakly i told you to dive

 youre a - liar retorted

lewis

  of course i picked this moment to put
in my own oar i wasnt attracting
enough attention anyway in a few
well chosen words i told ryan how
lewis had gone through what was liter-
ally hell-fire to bring him ryan out of
the wreck and ryan replied

  yes and damn him if he had obeyed
orders there wouldnt have been any
wreck

  the same farmer who had produced
the waterbag put in a second appearance
he had gone back to his car-which
didnt look anything like a farmers car
ought to look-and drove it around be-
side ryan and lewis

  might be a good idea boys he said
quietly to get to a hospital or some-
thing this buggy will do sixty on a
bet and even better if everybody keeps
his mouth shut-and for all we know
everyone of you three guys may be all
smashed inside

  lewis knelt and lifted ryan in his
arms-and ryan passed out

  it was a miraculous escape for ryan
all around and we discovered at the
hospital that he was in fair shape ex-
cept for a few broken ribs a smashed
leg a broken arm or two and a gap in
his head of just the right size to hold
a nice silver plate-and a few burns here
and there on the rest of his body lewis
was badly burned too-and later on
they decided that theyd need some-
bodys skin to graft onto him and

picked on me because i had so much
of it and after lewis had twice
smashed me in the mouth with his
clenched fist can you beat it and
then they kept me in the hospital too
while the places where they had used a
razor on me were getting well to make
matters worse they fairly smothered me
in adhesive tape miles more of it than
was actually needed and when the cuts
and slashes from which they had taken
skin to graft on lewis were healed they
told me id have to pull off the adhesive
tape myself-and im as hairy as an
ape

  it took me three weeks to get the tape
off a hair at a time pulled out by the
roots

  but i managed it finally and the chow
was so good at the hospital i decided to
stick around until ryan was entirely on
the road to recovery but i had to groan
every time a nurse came around to keep
them from kicking me out as a fraud
you see i wanted to see how this thing
was going to come out i was still the
peacemaker and wanted to see ryan
and lewis shake hands

  lewis got out first and we didnt see
him for a week though my heart ham-
mered every time a door opened a
dozen times a day i fancied those two
coming together again and lewis grin-
ning widely grasping ryans bandaged
hand in a clasp of eternal friendship
across a sea of coverlets very touch-
ing as i saw it sentimental enough to
please even an old maid

  then lewis walking on tip-toe look-
ing sheepish finally came in-in flying
clothes his nerve then apparently
was still good he came to me first

  slip in and tell ryan i want to see
him the nurse told me to come on in

i owe ryan an apology i do remember
something now about him telling us to
dive if anything happened

  fine the scene was now set for
m sentimental fade-out and i actually
wiped away a tear as i hurried to ryans
ward he was awake and propped up
on his pillows like a mummy he waved


air stories

a bandaged hand at me as i entered i
guess he grinned but all  could see of

 him was his eyes

lewis is out here ryan i said
and he wants to see you said some-
thing about owing you an apology

georgie mumbled ryan through
three layers of gauze lewis doesnt
owe me anything damn it man
dont you realize that he saved my life

i waited for no more everything
was hotsy-totsy even i could see that
i ran back to lewis and gave him the
news

 the way he took it took all the wind
 out of my sails

why the-liar he said

 he faced about and left the hospital
 and didnt come back as long as ryan
 was there now what do you make of

that ive never been able to make it

out myself but i do know this ryan
has been back at dutch flats for six
months he and lewis still cuss each
other all over the place and seem to le
bitter enemies lewis still insultingly
collects his pay at the end of each day
and ryan docks him for every hour he
doesnt fly but lewis makes no move
to quit and ryan seems to have no in-
tention of firing him and the ryan air-
port is becoming more widely known
as the days pass

  out of the whole peculiar mix-up this
thing strikes me as the most peculiar
of the whole crowd who heard ryan
that fateful day tell us all to dive in
case of trouble i was the only one wh
carried out orders-and i darned near
forgot to pull the ripcord

    in the days when the horse-thief thrived throughout the southwest ranchers
and cowmen banded together to form a protective association they had their
hands full in running down the criminals and their loot in the hey-day of the horse-
thief in the early fifties in missouri the practice of rustling other peoples horses
became so widespread and was operated on such a successful scale that criminals
flocked to the state and the anti-horsethief association resulted

    methods of protection found effective in the western mining camps were used
by the founders of the organization major mckee and h a stewart who were
ers in the gold days of california for years after the civil war when horse
thievery flourished the a h t a made it hot for members of the rustling clan
tom king was one of the most notorious and most successful raiders of the period
the society and federal government tried for some time in vain to curb the activi-
ties of this wary criminal in three years he stole-more animals than any other
man a complete puzzle to his pursuers he evaded every trap with a marvelous
intuition that left them dumfounded

    the society often protected banks and gradually drifted into a general law
enforcement body spreading through the southwest and extending east into illi-
nois iowa and ohio in  the kansas branch of the association spread its field
to running down motor thieves

    but now just as the motor thief supplanted the horse rustler so the purloiner
of airplanes is pushing out the rustler of motor cars several air machine robberies
have been reported in the southwest recently and the old but nevertheless effective
a h t a will soon be taking up the problem of curtailing the efforts of the new-
est brand of thieving criminal	jerry scanlon

air stories

about a hundred campfires that shower
red glows into the skies and far off
in the arctic night the eerie howl of
famished wolves mingles with the snarls
and wails of malemutes baying at a
frigid moon

  here and there along the tortuous
trail that twists over icy glaciers and
through snow-bound mountain passes
were gathered men from the four cor-
ners of the world the strong and the
weak the good and the bad those who
had followed it across the face of the
earth for a lifetime among them all
there was but one woman

  it was no place for a woman jim
sanderson had pleaded he had cursed
and raged he had sworn that his daugh-
ter should not accompany him north
but astra sanderson possessed in addi-
tion to startling beauty a will of her
own her weapon was irresistible not
to be gainsaid a wistful appealing ex-
pression of deep-hurt that came into
her violet eyes at will so it was that
when jim sanderson guided his male-
mutes over the snow-trail a slender
boyish figure raced with lithe ease be-
side him

  the first few days sanderson had
traveled at a killing pace hed show this
strong-willed daughter of his that stam-
peding was a mans game but upon
the third night when they stopped to
make camp this grizzled veteran of a
hundred stampede trails looked at the
boyishly-slender young girl with un-
concealed pride and admiration

  honey youre a lot more trail-
hardened than some old-timers you
oughtve been a man

  a mans woman thats me dad
she laughed i wouldnt have missed
this for a fortune and this time were
going to make the big strike

  cant miss it astra jim replied
with the same fervid conviction in his
voice that he had uttered the same
words upon a hundred other occasions
when he had missed it he ate silently
for a while his eyes studying the girl
fovertly but it aint just the hard-

ships of the trail that makes it bad for

a girl he said presently therell be
all kinds of men in the camp and
therell be whiskey whiskey and men
dont go to make things pleasant in a
country like this and if this turns out
to be a big thing therell be gambling-
dens dance-halls and hell-raising in
general id feel some better if you
was back in frisco with your aunt

   asira laughed and threw a stick of
wood into the fire showering ruby
sparks into the night pshaw dad i
its just as safe up here for a woman
as it is back in frisco-safer besides
ive always been pretty much able to
take care of myself she completed
a little defiantly

  a long silence fell between them
the girl was staring into the crackling
embers with far-away dreamy eyes jim
was lying back against the sled looking
up into the starlit night

   purty aint they he asked sud-
denly

  what dad  she turned about

   the stars he said softly lots of
times ive laid on my back and looked
up there wondering what was behind
them dancin lights- he sat upright
suddenly and looked at her it was
the stars that give me your name years
ago back in kansas i member seein
a motter that read ad astro i found
out it means to the stars thats how
i happened to call you astra-i figgered
it meant stars your ma- he broke
off suddenly and reached for an ember
to light his pipe in order that the girl
could not see the expression that came
into his eyes

  a-and mother dad one small
soft hand crept about his calloused fin-
gers her eyes looked at him tenderly
while a misty wistfulness filmed their
violet depths i  ive always liked
to think that mother was up there be-
hind those star-gleams smiling and
looking down upon you and me
wouldnt you like to believe it that
way dad she whispered softly

   w-why sure honey he said husk-
north of the stars



ily and something caught in his throat
he got awkwardly to his feet and astra
looked at him a little startled reckon
i-i better get some wood he
mumbled he had mentioned the girls
mother before he thought it was not
likely that a woman who had run away
with another man leaving her two-year-
old baby was with the stars but astra
had always been told that her mother
was dead

  it was some minutes after her father
had gone after wood that astra heard a
low chuckle behind her she whirled
and faced a swarthy pock-marked man
leering at her

  hello dream-girl sometimes fate
is kind beauty lost in the wilderness
alone and forsaken

  astra sprang to her feet with an angry
flash in her eyes

  you may run back to your own fire
this one is private she said icily

  what he chuckled you wont
allow a weary trail-worn knight of the-
gold trail to warm the life-blood with-
out which he must perish but ah
his face sobered in mock-sadness it
has ever been thus with fair maidens-
not one small glowing ember will they
give from the warmth of their smile to
warm a-

  i told you to move on a small
hand darted toward a hip-pocket of her
corduroy breeches but before she
could draw the small automatic which
she carried there he was upon her
his arms were about her and she caught
the foul odor of whiskey upon his
breath

  now she saw his leering face above
her hideous in the shadowy fire-glow
ill just take one little kiss and-damn
you

  astra had managed to wrench one
hand free and with all her force she
crashed a small fist into his face
caught by momentary surprise he re-
leased his grasp in that moment her
hand darted once more toward her
pocket this time she succeeded in draw-
ing the gun

  i dont waste words with skunks
she said in a cold calm voice get out
or theyll have to carry you out

  a moment he stared at the gun and
then leered into her face wrell be
meeting again snow-dove and dont
forget i have first claim by right of dis-
covery he turned upon his heel and
staggered back down the trail

  when her father returned with an
armful of wood she said nothing about
the encounter she knew that if he
learned that someone had insulted his
girl he would take the kind of action
that had earned for him the sobriquet of
hell-fire sanderson

  reckon one more load wall be
enough he said ill get it in a
jiffy

  think ill go with you dad she
said casually so that he might not sus-
pect her of having any fear of remain-
ing alone

  better stick here and keep an eye
open you cant tell about some of this
bunch they might steal your eye-
teeth with half a chance

  rather than arouse any suspicion
astra nodded acquiescence and sat
down again facing the fire after what
seemed a long time to her she got to
her feet and walked a short distance
in the direction taken by her father
he seemed a long time about returning
looking back along the trail she could
see myriad sparks showered heaven-
ward and shadowy forms hovering or
moving about campfires she decided
that it would be safe for her to walk
a little way from her own fire

  when she had gone a hundred yards
without seeing anything of her father
some indefinable fear took possession
of her and she hurried her steps five
hundred yards from the campfire she
came to an abrupt halt a shivering chill
coursing over her from the murky
shadows of the evergreens came a low
groan she uttered a terrified cry and
sprang forward

  beneath an evergreen a form lay
motionless astra fell upon her knees


air stories

beside the prone figure of her father

dad dad she cried with a sob

what has happened

  the head moved slowly and jim
looked at her from pain-filled eyes

  wait girl he commanded weakly
they aint nothin to go into hysterics
about i reckon  done busted my
laig its painin to beat hell

  w-why didnt you call dad she
sobbed

   smatter of fact a sheepish grin
overspread his pain-drawn lips i
fainted just cornin around uow go
back down th trail aways and find bill
travis anti his pardner theyll help
me back to the sled you cant pack
me and i cant walk

  ill get them right away she cried
she sprang to her feet and raced away
through the shadows like a pursued
fawn

  astra had no more than disappeared
than a form flitted from the shadows
of a nearby evergreen and crept toward
sanderson

  looks like were meeting again
hellfire a low voice spoke from
above the prostrate man quite a
pleasure

  at the sound of that voice an icy
chill crept up the spine of the injured
man

  stronk he groaned

  good guess jim stronk sneered
ive been looking for you a long time
i didnt follow this stampede for the
particular purpose of finding you but
i had an idea you wouldnt be far be-
hind the leaders i saw your girl a
little earlier tonight at the campfire
didnt know she was yours then i
just happened to stumble along here a
little after she found you in fact he
laughed evilly i was following her
when she found you i believe that
you and i can reach a settlement of our
differences without bloodshed jim
and with a dry laugh stronk slipped
away into the shadows

for the time being jim forgot his
paining leg a broken leg was an in-

significant trifle beside this sudden ap-
jjearance f stronk stronk had seen
astra his remarks about her jim
understood the meaning of only too
well and against this gambler cut-
throat ex-convict hellfire was helpless
stronk knew the real story ol astras
mother he had been present that
night when hellfire met the man who
stole her and stronk alone knew that
it had been sanderson who had killed
that man there was only one thing
to be done stronk must be killed
grim hues came into the old prospec-
tors pain-racked face stronk would lie
killed

chapter ii
north of the stars

he sat alone at a table in a far
comer of a waterfront saloon
at other tables about the room bois-
terous groups of men poured rot-gut
whiskey down their gullets and mingled
their ribald songs and raucous guffaws
with the inharmonious din of a mechan-
ical piano the lone man was oblivious
to the others and to the foul-odored
fumes of man-sweat and whiskey that
permeated the blue haze of tobacco
smoke that filled the room his eyes
were fixed in a far-away expression
upon a faded fly-specked lithograph
tacked upon the opposite wall but it
was not the picture upon the wall that
he was seeing from the shadows of
long-gpne years there crept another
picture

  a long line of khaki-clad men four
abreast thousands of shouting cheer-
ing people who flanked the street yet
more vivid than it all in his minds eye
was a low hedge-fence and a little cot-
tage beyond a vine-trellised pathway
with the moonbeams showering upon a
girl the girl came slowly toward him
she was pale and her lips quivered

  kay- she quavered and then his
arms were about her crushing her tn
north of the stars



him his lips seeking hers she strug-
gled free from his embrace her eyes
stared at him affrighted kay   
kay    you mustnt i  i am
married

  the blood drained from his face and
he staggered back as though a poniard
had pierced his heart she was speak-
ing to him her words came haltingly
jerkily their meaning sank into his
consciousness and he tried to smile
tried to take her hand and wish her
all the happiness in the world he
failed miserably his smile was ghastly
terrible pain was written upon his
face pain and something more some-
thing too awful for her to understand
he staggered a little as he turned away
from her his voice was too choked to
utter the lie that was framed upon his
lips its all right lois

  kay kay she cried taking a step
toward him and lifting her hands in
appeal you understand kay i-i
thought you would never return

  yes he understood she had sold
herself to the highest bidder his wealth
had been swept away while he was in
france she wanted luxury position
the things that only wealth could give
her and she had married a man that
could give it to her yes he under-
stood  but how hard it seemed to be-
lieve it true	
blindly he groped his way toward
the gate

  kay something she read in his
eyes caused her voice to tremble in fear
kay where are you going

  a moment he lifted his head and
their eyes met hers flinched and has-
tily fell a bitter twisted smile came
onto his lips

  to hell he laughed harshly

  and he had

  it had been hard those first years
hard to tear out memories of moonlit
nights and low-whispered vows of
eternal love hard to trample into the
ashes of forgetfulness a vision that
had been a guiding-star through the
horror and suffering of shell-shattered

france hard-but whiskey had helped

  he was broken now the mocking
shadow of a man who was a lurking
creature who haunted the street of
down-and-outers human wreckage
washed by the tides of destiny onto the
shores of broken and forgotten men

  i am going to hell the words
screamed into his ears re-echoing
through the corridors of buried mem-
ories he laughed harshly and clutched
the bottle that set before him his
dirt-grimed hand shook and the whis-
key over-ran the glass as he poured a
drink he looked into the glass and
brushed a ragged coat-sleeve across his
eyes as though he would blot out a
vision he gulped the fiery liquid and
struggled to his feet

  clutching the edge of the table he
swayed unsteadily his dirty cap was
pushed askew over his uncombed hair
that half covered his ears his face was
unshaven his clothes ragged

  well kay i see youre still drunk
-and drinking

  kays bloodshot eyes stared at the
man who had pulled out a chair and
sat down at the table opposite him

  still drunk abbott he slumped
back into the chair and fastened bleared
eyes upon the other always drunk
he rested his unshaven chin in the
palm of his hands and leered at abbott
with owlish solemnity got nuzzer
job abbott

  abbott was studying him with an ex-
pression of unconcealed contempt in his
glittering aloe-like eyes abbott prided
himself upon his knowledge of men
and he was debating now as to whether
or not this sodden human could be
framed to substitute in the electric chair
for one who was more valuable to the
plans of juan abbott and as he
studied kay his slender well-mani-
cured fingers drummed a tattoo upon
the table in those fingers of juan
abbott were held the threads of destiny
of more than one lurking creature who
slunk through the warrens of the under-
world


air stories

  a job he sneered hell kay
youve never been sober enough to
handle a real job

  kay raised his chin from his palms
and nodded in slow wobbly agreement
thas right always drunk once-
he waggled a grimy finger toward the
other was big man plenty money
frens was all big men went to war
   was avator ace    govment
gimme medals for bein ace woman
   damn woman he glared at
abbott as though expecting defiance
abbott was staring at him with a new
startled interest in his glittering eyes
yes damn woman i tol her go to
hell    no- he shook his head in
grave contradiction tol her i was
goin to hell buy nuzzer drink ol man
-damn woman

  you were an aviator during the
war there was a suppressed excite-
ment in the voice i suppose you came

with someone else and you went to

there are in the world

  yes lots woman in worl all no
damn good gonna buy nuzzer lil
drink ol man im thirsty as hell

  with a contemptuous sneer at the
sodden figure abbott motioned for the
bartender to bring a bottle as kays
shaking hand readied toward the bottle
with trembling eagerness abbott who
had been immersed in a deep study
suddenly reached forth and grasped
it

  before you get too sodden to talk
i want to ask you some questions
questions kays bleared eyes
stared at him hazily want ash me
questions sure ash me anyshing
you could still fly-if you were
sober

  shober a startled expression
came into the bleared eyes shober
he laughed harshly never gonna get

  you drink no more tonight kay
abbott jerked the bottle away from the

clutching fingers youre going to
sober up and stay that way until you
finish a job for me and by god
youll handle it right or ill- he
broke off leaving the threat unfinished

  nuzzer job kays head lolled in
a half-stupor

yes a job and youll handle it

drink this side of hell-and there isnt
any there youre going north to fly

with a short laugh

        chapter iii
        millions in gold

in the cabin of the falcon captain
lorngen a squat bull-necked man
with a brutal face was giving an atten-
tive ear to the low-spoken words of
juan abbott from outside there came
the searching of capstans and the roar-
ing of a voice shouting orders to per-
spiring men who were loading the boat

  see that you dont have a slip-up on
this thing lorngen were playing for
high stakes in this game tonight be-
fore you weigh anchor there will be a
passenger come aboard he will be
the only one besides you and i who
know of his coming aboard for a mo-
ment a malevolent glitter came into the
aloe eyes remember lorngen hes
to be landed in hell not alaska

  hell it will be lorngen chuckled
ill see that hes chucked overboard
in the deepest part of the bering with
enough lead tied to his heels to take
him to the bottom and keep him there
and the man i brought aboard last
night has he sobered up but i sup-
pose not lies been drunk too long to
sober in a night abbott studied the
captains face for a moment with shrewd
eyes i have an idea captain that
youre getting curious about this game
lorngen shrugged im paid to fol-
low orders not to be curious
north of the stars



  abbott thumped the table for a mo-
ment and then looked up with a thin
smile quirking at his lips

  thats a sensible attitude captain
but i believe that you should know
something about this game this is a
game where the stakes are high you
know of course about the big strike
that has been made in the north-coun-
try and no doubt youve heard that it
is far back

  the captain nodded a puzzled ex-
pression in his beady eyes youre
figgern on us goin to alaska then
he asked doubtfully

  not at all captain  abbott smiled
you will touch no port until you re-
turn to frisco the cargo that is being
loaded into your hatches consists of
gasolene hydrogen gas under com-
pression and a hydro-plane he
chuckled at the expression of blank
amazement upon the captains face i
see you dont catch on ill explain in
more detail

  this strike up north has turned out
to be a big thing but it is a long way
from civilization which is our good for-
tune the gold from each clean-up will
be stored and kept until such time as
snow falls then it will be hauled out by
dog-team there is no fear of thieves
where could a thief drag a ton of gold
to over glacier trails and through moun-
tain passes he wouldnt get any-
where and if there were more than one
and they reached a port what would
happen  hed be grabbed at once so
you see the miners arent losing any
sleep over their gold

  damn lorngens ham-like fist
crashed upon the table and an unfeigned
light of admiration shone in his piggish
eyes abbott youre a genius 

  not at all captain abbott smiled
im an opportunist the passenger
who will come aboard tonight was the
originator of the scheme hes an
aviator with ideas his only trouble
was that he doesnt understand fairness
in a division of spoils my agreement
with him was that id furnish all trans-

portation costs including the plane and
in return i would receive twenty-five
per cent of all the booty he wouldnt
accept any other arrangement so cap-
tain its up to you to see that he is safely
landed where he cant talk later the
man i brought aboard last night is also
an aviator he was an ace in france
came back and found his woman mar-
ried-and went to the dogs he
sneered

  hell lorngen snorted disgustedly

  but hes the man we need keep him
off the booze and get him into shape be-
fore you get to your anchorage if he
cant be gotten in shape or he refuses-
again an evil glitter came into the black
eyes youll have two passengers for
hell

  many as you say abbott cant let
little things like that stand between us
and a fortune

  ive already got one man in the gold-
camp-stronk hell take care of things
up there ill give you maps charts
and full directions as to what to do
then after you get in touch with stronk
hell handle the rest of the program
itll be three months yet before any gold
is taken out and by that time kay will
have met stronk at a point indicated on
the chart stronk will see that the gold
is brought to a point where kay can
reach it stronk will be one of the
party who accompanies the gold-sled
out at the right time he will place
knock-out drops in the others water-sup-
ply and while theyre sleeping hell hook
the gold onto the balloons

  balloons i thought you said-

  oh i forgot abbott smiled
were taking the hydrogen gas to fill
the balloons kay will only have to
grab-hook the gold-carrying balloons
tow them a safe distance cut the bal-
loons loose and load the gold in the
plane there will be no trail in the
snow going away from the sled no dues
no tracks nothing whatever to show
where the gold went or how itll just
go up in thin air

  the stupendous master-stroke of this

plan took the captains breath away and

left him speechless he sat gaping at
abbott open-mouthed

  now about kay its up to you to
keep him off the booze dont cut him
off suddenly but dont let him get
drunk everything depends upon him
being in condition to fly once you are
at your anchorage in the bering we
are depending upon him to handle the
plane and carry the gold aboard the ship
you might see if hes in shape to talk
to drag him in here and ill see how
he stands with us

  the captain climbed to his feet and
rolled through the door it was twenty
minutes later that he returned with kay
abbott looked up with an expression of
undisguised disgust as kay paused in
the doorway his hands gripping the
door-jambs to support himself upright

  he was not a pleasant looking sight
for a human his eyes were bloodshot
his lips twitched spasmodically he was
grotesque scarecrow like in the loose
greasy clothes that were smeared with
dirt he lurched into the cabin and
sprawled into a chair facing abbott

  give me a drink for gods sake
he croaked im damn close to the
jimmies

  abbott nodded in disgust and the cap-
tain brought forth a bottle

  when the bottle wras set before him
kay did not pause to use the glass but
raised the pint-flask to his lips his
hand shook so that the glass bottle-neck
chattered against his teeth when he
had gulped half the bottles contents he
set it down the liquor quieted his
nerves and brought him to that half-
way state where he was neither drunk
nor sober but a few more drinks and
he would have been drunk

  kay abbotts eyes narrowed into
mere slits im going to give you a
chance to brace up make a stake and be
a man-do you want that chance

  a slow ironic smile quirked at the
corners of kays mouth he laughed
harshly brace up hell it took me
six years to put me where i am-six

years to make a drunkard and now
you ask me if i want to brace up be a
man why should i  he asked bit-
terly ive about reached the end of
the rope there was a time when i had
nerve-but it was a long time ago i
lack enough now to add a drop of
prussic acid to my liquor and forget
the whole damn rotten mess i started
out to go to hell ive gotten there-i
dont want to brace up he reached
for the bottle and lifted it toward his
lips then he lowered it and looked at
abbott curiously be a man why
havent you any ambition  dont you
want to be somebody do you like the
filth youve wallowed in

  abbott a fleeting glint came into
the bleared eyes i dont know what
youre driving at-i dont give a damn
i dont want to be anybody i have no
ambition except to stay drunk stay
drunk and forget things that a sober
man couldnt

  forget abbott sneered forget
some damned woman that sent you to
the dogs because you didnt have guts
enough to be a game loser a hell of a
jack-pot youd have won if you had got-
ten her the world is full of that kind of
women-the kind that give weak-spined
men who lack guts to buck life an
alibi for going to the dogs lacking guts
they go to hell with scorned love as an
alibi he paused and leaned forward
his glittering eyes fastened upon kay
scornfully

  whatever juan abbott might have
lacked it was not a knowledge of men
he needed this man he was a vital ele-
ment to his plans but before he could
use him he must save him from him-
self there was no philanthropy or
altruism in the make-up of the under-
world king he worked always for his
own ends and knowing men he taunted
the shadow of the man before him

  kay youre a damn yellow quitter
you havent the guts to live nor the
nerve to die

  an angry flame flared into the blood-
shot gray eyes the sallow face set in
north of the stars



grim lines abbott watching narrowly
exulted for a moment it seemed as
though abbotts words had found one
ember in the ashes of manhood and
had stirred it into flame then kay
suddenly slumped down in his chair
with a harsh laugh

  why this sudden paternal solicitude
for my soul abbott you talk like a re-
former not like a crooked politician and
master of underworld denizens

  i dont give a damn for your soul
kay the aloe-like eyes flared im
looking out for my own interests i
need an aviator a man that can fly
and leave the booze alone for six
months if you can qualify ill pay you
enough money to buy yourself a dis-
tillery and you can go to hell on better
whiskey than youve been guzzling six
months wont change the scenery and
therell be more there to greet you
then

  suppose kay nodded toward the
bottle which abbott had taken that
you and me have another drink before
we talk about this ticket to hell 

  abbott sprafrg to his feet and with
a contemptuous oath crashed the bottle
into fragments against the wall he
turned upon kay his black eyes afire
with a light of utter scorn

  by god kay they say there is al-
ways one last spark of manhood left
always one last drop of red-blood in a
man youve never been a man youve
crawled so low and deep into the slime
and mud of depravity that there isnt
anything left of you but a bestial de-
praved creature of the sewer youve
forgotten the woman that gave you
birth  youve-

  damn you abbott with one leap
kay sent the table crashing to the floor
another leap and he was upon his
taunter with all of his power he sent
his fist crashing into the sardonically
leering face he fought like a wildcat
unleashed and from between his lips
came gasping oaths but whiskey had
long since burned out his stamina he
sagged back weakly and would have

fallen had not abbott caught him he
looked up into the face of the man who
held him damn you abbott id
kill you if i had the power his eys
were ablaze and beneath his unkempt
beard his face was deathly pale

  abbott picked up the over-ttirned
table and righted it then he dropped
kay into a chair and sat down opposite
there was a light of approval in the
glittering eyes

  well kay he smiled into the en-
raged eyes i done my damndest to
strike a spark and i guess i did but
you know that i have only spoken the
truth

  the light died out of the gray eyes
his shoulders sagged and he nodded his
head

  yes youre right abbott forget
it he said wearily and for gods
sake give me a drink

  abbott got up and returned with a
bottle he set it upon the table

  there it is kay if youve got any
manhood leave it alone and listen to
my proposition

 but kays fingers were already
clutched about the bottle his hand shak-
ing his eyes burning with a greedy fire
of craving he halted the bottle half-
way toward his lips and looked at b-
bott a moment he hesitated and then
placed the bottle to his lips he took a
long drink and set the bottle down

  i am ready to listen to your proposi-
tion abbott

  i have no proposition for a whiskey
sewer abbott sneered i need a man
not a drunkard 

  ill not get drunk again for six
months if i take your proposition i
cant cut it all off at once

  for a long minute the glittering eyes
bored into the gray ones then he shoved
out a slender hand its a bargain
kay you stay sober for six months
and follow instructions and ill give you
fifty thousand dollars-in gold

  kay stared and then a thin smile
curled at the corners of his lips he
shook his head slowly


air stories

  im no fool abbott you wouldnt

pay that much money for the treasure-

map of the incas

  treasure of the incas abbott
laughed the treasure of the incas is
chicken-feed im playing for the trea-
sure-house of the world millions in
goldr

  and my part in this deal kay was
smiling in disbelief what do i do
for this fifty thousand in gold

  as youre told abbott snapped
have you any scruples about going
beyond the law 

  the law kay laughed harshly
id willingly stay sober for a year if i
could even scores with the law ive
been thrown in their hell-holes of ver-
min and had their brute fists slash my
face theyve framed me kicked me
pounded me-hell whats the use
abbott shrugged dont blame them
a man that acts like a beast and wants
to remain that way has no kick coming
when hes treated like a beast

  but the proposition abbott you
can rest assured i have no belief in
god no faith in man ill take your
proposition sight unseen but he
added with a dry laugh i think i am
a damn fool for doing it

  youll need equipment and you
would look better with a shave and hair-
cut ill stake you to that now but re-
member cut out the booze if you get
drunk and blab ill kill you you know
too much little as it is

chapter iv
honor among thieves

day after day the falcon had
plowed her way northward
through choppy seas kay had not been
drunk since leaving port neither had
he quit drinking in compliance with
abbotts orders lomgen had supplied
him with enough whiskey to quiet nerves
that cried for it but not enough to
render him drunk

  kay gave little thought to the part
that he was to play in abbotts game
now and then something would stir
within him a desire vague yet real to
fight back once again into the ranks of
men but always there remained that
picture of a vine-trellised arbor and a
girl in the moonlight no after all
those vague desires were only added
agony-a fools payment for having be-
lieved in a woman perhaps abbott had
been right he lacked guts he had said
after all what did it matter what
was there to fight back to  she had been
all tliat he had in the world his whole
life had been centered about her and-
but why think about it forget with
fifty thousand dollars he could go to
some far-oft corner of the world and-
well kav lorngens voice broke
into his thoughts were getting close to
our anchorage where well lay-to

  kay nodded shortly and turned his
gaze once more back to the deserted
horizon of the sea the captain was
studying him closely

  you know lomgen said slowly
ive been doing a lot of thinking the
last week maybe youd like to step
below and listen to what ive been think-
ing about over a drink

  kay laughed drvly i dont give a
damn what youve been thinking about
captain but ill accept the drink part
of your offer

  seated in the cabin lomgen looked
across the table at kay with shrewd
eyes he was a vastly different kay
than that night he had come aboard he
was clean-shaven his eyes had lost their
reddish-blear his clothing was neat and
his face though still hollow in the
cheeks possessed color

  you know kay me and you are the
real wheels in this machinery that ab-
bott is running

  kay nodded briefly and poured him-
self a drink

  now ive been thinking-

  you need not speak captain im a
mind-reader a slow smile crept onto
kays lips i bring the gold aboard
north of the stars



we up anchor and sail away to a port
far removed from frisco abbott is
left holding-whatever there is left to
hold

  lorngen chuckled approvingly thats
the ticket we sail southward where
theres waving palms brown-hued beau-
ties and drinks galore where they dont
ask how you got your gold but have
you got it v 

  kay nodded his head a sardonic
quirk pulling down the corners of his
lips yes i heartily approve the plan
captain abbott came across in that
way we may as well go a step farther
in this thieves robbing thieves there is
no honor among thieves captain nor
he added vindictively women 

  heres the key to the rum locker
lorngen threw it upon the table go
the limit but be sober for business

  and kay went the limit two hours
later he was still seated at the table his
eyes bleary his mouth agape his mouth
twisted into a foolish leering smile he
lolled his head about as the door opened
and lorngen entered a contemptuous
light came into the captains eyes but
he nodded pleasantly

  thats the ticket one good celebra-
tion before we get down to business and
then with millions in gold well cele-
brate for the rest of our lives eh

  thas right kays head wobbled in
an affirmative he pushed out a chair
and motioned toward it sit down
hav drink capn im drunks hell
good joke on abbott eh his bleared
eyes surveyed the captain with a cun-
ning leer

  the captain sat down he poured
himself a drink and smiled to himself
as he drank it abbott might think that
he was a fool but lorngen was well
pleased with himself he had just re-
turned from the cabin aft where ab-
bott s aviator had been kept prisoner
during the trip the captains interview
had been entirely satisfactory he now
possessed an ace up his sleeve in short
the captain had explained to the pris-
oner that abbott had ordered him to be

thrown overboard that the crew was
all for abbott and if they thought the
aviator was still alive they would per-
sonally attend to his demise therefore
explained the captain it would be better
for the prisoner to remain secluded in
his cabin later on he would have his
chance to even scores with abbott un-
doubtedly stronk had been told that
kay would be the man he would work
with therefore kay would be per-
mitted to make all arrangements ashore
with stronk at the proper time kay
would be relieved of his duties-and the
captain winked-and then lorngen and
the originator of the plan would spiit
the spoil - with the captain taking
the short end in this w-ise the captain
secured an ace-in-the-hole aces were
easily discarded in the bering the
real picture in the captains mind was
of himself with an undivided fortune in
gold

  better be turning in now kay we
lay-to tomorrow and youll have to be
in shape to make your first flight and
meet stronk next monday

  kay entered a voluble protest at thus
being deprived of further drink but the
captain caught him under the arm-pits
and half carried half dragged him to
his own cabin the captain locked the
door and put the key in his pocket he
was taking no chances on losing kay
overboard later on he would see that
kay went over properly equipped with
lead weights to keep him over with
millions in gold the captain of the fal-
con need fear no one

chapter v
buccaneers of the air

es ish nice place stronk kay
x nodded at his companion across
the table in the gold lure saloon and
dance hall shink ill stay while eh 
stronk chuckled and poured another
drink for the already drunken kay
it had been four weeks now since he


air stories

had first met kay at the appointed ren-
dezvous and after three weeks of con-
tinuous trips between the falcon and
the mainland kay had transported all
of the gas tanks and balloons which had
been cached

  there was an ironic glitter in
stronks deep-set eyes as he studied
kay covertly even as abbott as
lorngen and kay had plans so had
stronk nor did his plans contemplate
a division of the spoils with anyone

  you know kay abbott will reap a
fortune from this venture

  shink sho kays eyelids drooped
in owlish solemnity as he looked up
and then he chuckled abbott wont
get nushing men capn has scheme
goin sail way an take gol

  huh stronk sat upright with a
start of surprise he studied kay a
moment and then laughed dryly 
never thought i might have competi-
tion

  abbott didnt shink so either
kay chuckled maybe youd like join
men capn goin sail with gol
wheres lots of rum palms women-
damn women he interjected sud-
denly glaring at stronk belligerently as
though expecting an exception to the
curse woman ish no damn good
shtronk

  stronk shrugged with a smile and
got to his feet grasping kay by the
arm

  i wont contradict you old-timer
what say we take a walk ive been
thinking and i want to talk something
over with you

  a ludicrous smile came onto kays
lips and he chuckled he drew one eye-
lid down in a knowing wink

  im min reader shtronk dont
need walk need nuzzer drink

  despite kays remonstrances stronk
led him through the throng of milling
men and walked toward his cabin
kays revelation that lorngen and he
were also intending to double-cross
abbott had come as a surprise but
now that he knew it it was up to him

to declare himself in later he could
attend to kay and the captain right
now he was going to put kay to bed
to insure that he didnt babble in the
presence of someone else

  he had less difficulty than he ex-
pected kay slumped down on the
edge of the bunk weaved to and fro
for a moment and then crumpled up
and began to snore stronk left him
after first locking the cabin from the
outside and headed back toward the
camp

  some thirty minutes later stronk
knocked at the door of a cabin some
distance removed from the others
sandersons voice called for him to
enter

  jims face went slightly pale as he
saw who his visitor was one hand
crept cautiously beneath his pillow
where he kept a revolver stronk saw
the movement and sneered

  no fire-works jim ive come to
make you a proposition a proposition
that will settle our score without blood-
shed

  jims first thought was of astra
rendered helpless by his broken leg
which under the crude surgery of the
camp was healing very slowly he must
depend upon a gun as the only effective
means of protecting astra against the
gambler but already stronk was sus-
picious and he would have to be cau-
tious a sarcastic smile parted his lips

  a proposition he asked

 stronk nodded yes you have
been appointed caretaker of the camps
gold you arrange for me to accompany
the party that takes it out and all old
scores are wiped out

  sanderson stared at the swarthy-
faced man in startled amazement

  you aint figgern that you could
steal th shipment are you  he asked
wonderingly

  that has nothing to do with the
proposition stronk said coldly
your part is to see that i am a mem-
ber of the party that takes it out

  the old man looked at his visitor
north of the stars



from puzzled eyes there was some-
thing strange about this surely
stronk was not fool enough to try mak-
ing away with the gold

  you mean that stronk youll
forget about that affair in frisco

  ill forget that i ever knew you
ill also forget that you have a very
beautiful daughter

  a moment jim studied him closely
and then he nodded slowly

   all right ill see that youre one of
the party but you cant get away with
the shipment stronk not with-

  i have said nothing about stealing
or getting away jim stronk inter-
posed curtly its a bargain ive for-
gotten that i ever knew you

  for a long time after the gambler
left sanderson tried to conjecture some
reason for stronks request that
there was a very strong-and crooked
-reason jim had no doubt but he
did not think that he was betraying the
confidence of those who had appointed
him official treasurer of the camps
gold there was no place a man could
get to except a port and to do that
would be impossible without being
caught jim felt somewhat relieved
when stronk said that he would forget
astra and he was somewhat inclined
to believe him he had shown no
curiosity as to her whereabouts nor
had htf looked toward the door that led
to the other room and yet the old
stampeder was troubled he wished he
knew what stronk had up his sleeve

	 

  stronk had been gone from his cabin
only a short time when kay aroused
and staggered to his feet stronk had
left the oil lamp burning upon the
table and for a moment kay blinked
in bewilderment at his strange sur-
roundings then he climbed to his feet
and weaved toward the door he tried
to open it and found it locked he
stood swaying upon his feet consider-
ing this grave obstacle his gaze wan-
dered toward the back of the cabin and
a foxy grin came onto his lips he

   a s-aug-

staggered his way to the window and
after many attempts managed to get it
open another long struggle and he
raised himself to the sill and pitched
head-foremost to the ground

  he climbed to his feet and stood
blinking in uncertainty a sudden
thought possessed him that stronk had
put him to bed because he was drunk
he determined to return to the dance
hall and confront the gambler with
proof of his sobriety he lurched for-
ward in what he thought was the direc-
tion of the camp now and then his
foot would catch upon a root or stone
and he would sprawl upon the ground
after a long while he halted and leaned
against a tree for support

  ish funny shing dance hall has
moved he announced gravely sway-
ing to and fro need nuzzer lil drink
nice shoke on shtronk he chuckled
and once more lurched forward

  the moon crept above the green
canopy of the evergreens and swung
low in the heavens here and there
small creatures flitted through the shad-
ows of the night as kay lurched blindly
on unconsciously he was following a
well-worn trail time and again he
would stagger and fall and with ludi-
crous gravity crawl back to his feet
brush his clothes free of clinging
needles and continue his aimless jour-
ney

  he came to a small stream and for a
long while swayed upon his feet con-
templating it from bleared eyes he
extended one foot experimentally to see
if he could bridge it he lost his bal-
ance and pitched head foremost his
head struck the sharp corner of a boul-
der and he lay motionless

  when he opened his eyes again it
was to find someone standing over him
in the moonlight he could make out the
form but vaguely corduroy breeches
flannel shirt and pulled-down cap he
chuckled and attempted to climb back
upon his feet but he was unable to do
more than sit upright against the bole
of the tree behind him


air stories

   lo son he looked up his head
wobbling from side to side sheems
like m losh must a fell eh need
nuzzer lil drink an be all right

  astra looked down upon him with an
expression of revulsion in her eyes
she had found him less than ten min-
utes ago lying unconscious and had
dragged him from the water

   think she said in disgust that
you had better leave the drink alone
leave drink lone shober up
kays eyes blinked at her dim form in
the moonlight what for goin
have lots drinks soons sail way with
gol big joke on abbott eh he
chuckled

  youd better pull yourself together
and get back to camp

  shay- a sudden thought occurred
to him you know where dance hall

take me there wanna liav nuzzer lil
drink men shtronk gonna shail way
with gol take me to dance hall an ill
make you partners damn woman
capn wansh woman i don wansh
woman no damn good what you
shink woman no good he tried to
fasten his gaze upon her but his head
persisted in wobbling and his vision dis-
covered only blurred outlines he
brushed his hand across his eyes while
a ludicrous expression of incredulity
came into his bleared eyes

  watching him a slow grin crept onto
astras lips and then she broke into an
amused laugh

  you know she grinned youre
about the most amusing-and disgust-
ing sight ive ever seen

 shink so he asked gravely
shink im musing an sgusting
shay son his face assumed an owlish
gravity and he tried to see her but she
was only a blur in the moonlight to his
bleared vision you take me to dance
hall an men shtronk will make you
partner lotsa gol goin shail way
with gol in airship

  do what astra came closer a
startled expression coining into her

eyes what do you mean take gold

in an airship

  good shoke eh kay chuckled in-
anely steal gol from miners   
fly way where nobody knows yesh
ish nice shoke on abbott

  oh she took a startled pace
backyard comprehension was dawn-
ing upon her kays drunken gibberish
had at first merely disgusted her she
had given no attention to what he was
trying to say thinking it the meaning-
less jumble of a drunken mans mutter-
ings the mention of stronk and
reference to an airship sailing away
with gold caused her mind to conceive
of a possibility that had never occurred
to any of the miners an airship was
the one and only way in which thieves
could get the gold from the country
without being caught

  y-you mean you and stronk are
going to take the miners gold away in
an airship she came closer a tense
eagerness in her eyes as she waited the
answer

  kay raised his head and very slowly
closed first one eye and then the other
then he strained them both open trying
to see her he shook his head wonder-
ingly and blinked there remained only
the outline of a blurred figure in cordu-
roy very slim and boyish

  ish funny thing he shook his head
puzzledly cant shee nushing what
say men jrou go dance hall an get a
drink im gettin shober mus never
get shober tol woman i was goin
hell    got to go woman is no
damn good son what you think
eh

  the moonlight came from over
astras shoulders and while kay could
not see her plainly she had a good view
of him she stared at him curiously
he apparently had forgotten her pres-
ence he closed his eyes and rested his
head against the tree-bole of a sudden
he began to mutter in an almost inco-
herent ramble it was a mixture of
maudlin self-pity and profane denun-
ciation of women astra looking at
north of the stars



him felt a mingling of emotions revul-
sion disgust pity after a while he
dropped sidewise to the ground and lay
there snoring

  but this gold she shook his
shoulder tell me about it

  allow me

  she whirled to confront the swarthy-
faced gambler standing in the trail be-
hind her a moment she stood poised
and then with a sudden leap she darted
away in four bounds he had over-
taken her and held her wrist captive in
a steel-like grasp

  sorry little reindeer he smiled
ironically we cant part with your
company so soon you know too much
that damn drunken fool-

   lo shtronk kay half-raised and
waved a wobbly hand nice shoke
lockin cabin so i cant get drink meet
m frien nice boy goin make im
partner

  you damn fool kay youve raised
hell mightve known that a few drinks
of booze and youd need to be tied
raish hell kay struggledjo his
feet and succeeded in acquiring a half-
stooped position swaying to and fro
whas matter

  for reply stronk took a step for-
ward dragging astra with him a
half-pace away from the weaving kay
he halted and drew back his fist he
sent the blow crashing into the drunken
mans face with an angry oath astra
suppressed a little cry of horror and
kay slumped upon the ground and lay
motionless

  now damn you lay there until i
come back for you

  a gasp escaped from the girls lips and
stronk whirled upon her with a snarl

  as for you ill make damn sure
that you dont have the chance of get-
ting back to camp before its too late
to hurt my plans and maybe he
laughed harshly youll never get back 
an angry flame came into her eyes
only to give way to an expression of
fear this was the first time she had
met stronk since that night upon the

trail months ago but she had heard
his name mentioned many times by the
miners there had been some talk of
running him out of the camp he
owned the gold lure gambling hall and
saloon his whiskey was rot-gut and his
games were crooked more than one
drunken miner had awakened after a
night of carousal at the gold lure to
discover the hard-earned gold-dust of
a months clean-up gone because
stronk had never molested nor come
near her in the camp astra had grown
to believe that he had forgotten the epi-
sode on the trail she thought that he
had been too drunk at the time to re-
member it afterward

  where are you going to take me
she asked trying to keep the fear she
felt from her voice

  stronk whirled her in front of him
and his dark eyes glittered with a fire
that frightened her she cringed back

  do with you  he leered at her
little reindeer youre going to have
a sea voyage im going to take you
with me

  astras face went pale she made no
tetort her mind was racing to grasp
some means of extricating herself from
the power of stronk ordinarily she
might have had some hope of help com-
ing from the camp but she would not
be expected back that night because she
had left to visit a sick squaw her
father would not expect her to return
before the following day when she
reached the squaws cabin she had
found her up and about so astra had
started for home it was then that she
had stumbled upon the drunken kay
at the thought of kay a small flame
of hope sprang up within her if only
someone would come along and find
him and he would talk were he to
talk about the airship and stronk who-
ever found him would bear the news
to camp post-haste and stronk would
be sought it was a slim chance but
it seemed the only one even then
could they find her was he going to
take her away tonight suddenly her


air stories

blood chillcd she understood every-
thing now there was a ship anchored
in the bering and the airplane was to be
used to transport the gold between the
mainland and the ship

  well snow-dove stronks voice
broke into her thoughts im going to
get many of those kisses you refused
me that night wont it be romantic
a tinge of irony came into the words
just you and i on a moon-lit deck
sailing southward into the land of sun-
shine and love

- you dirty cur astras eyes blazed
youll be strung up before you get
fifty miles away when the camp hears
about this-

  they wont his sardonic laugh in-
terposed theyll never hear of it be-
cause therell be no one left to tell
them m

  please she looked at him from
frightened eves let me go ill never
mention a word of what i heard
youre much too precious my dear
he said mockingly why i love you
too much to ever allow you to leave me
again-until the end of the voyage
he completed with an evil chuckle

  she made no further retort she real-
ized that it was useless to hope for
him to free her not once along the
trail to his cabin did stronk relax his
vigilance reaching the cabin he pushed
astra inside closed the door and placed
his back against it his eyes glittering
evilly then very slowly he advanced
toward her

  her face bloodless her body trem-
bling she watched him glide toward her
like a hawk upon its wounded prey

  i am not like kay little snow-dove
he allowed one woman to send him to
the dogs he hates em while i an
evil smile parted his lips i love them
all especially when they are beautiful
he reached out and grasped her in his
arms she struggled against his em-
brace and kicked at him but he only
laughed and drew her closer his sen-
sual lips drew closer just one little
kiss song-bird

  shay was dickens of a way-
kay had staggered against the door and
it had burst open sprawling him upon

the floor he climbed slowly to his feet
an expression of startled wonderment
in his eyes at the scene before him

  stronk whirled upon him with an
angry oath thought i left you back
there on the trail

  nope kay staggered to the table
and slumped down in a chair wearily
say you an nuzzer feller goin way
something fell on me knocked me coo-
coo but here i am right shide up
want li l drink m thirsty as the deuce
all right stronk glared at him
angrily were liitting the trail youll
sober up by the time weve walked
twenty miles youre going to take a
passenger back to the ship and when
you get her aboard youre coming back 
her kay blinked from one to the
other in surprise in the small corduroy-
clad figure cringing in a comer he did
not recognize a woman which her
no woman shtronk dont want no
woman wont have no woman wont
take no woman on ship-women can go
to grass

  as for you stronk whirled upon
astra make just one break and ill
make you regret it remember that jim

gold is all aboard ill see that youre
brought back and safely landed ten miles
from camp you can tell them then
well be too far away for them to stop
us its up to you do i have to bind
and gag you or will you go quietly

  i-ill go quietly she whispered in
a small voice

chapter vi
battle

the anchorage of the hydro-plane
was in a cove at an extreme point
of a small lakfe twenty miles from the
north of the stars



camp travel in this direction was a
remote possibility

  with a drunken man who could walk
only in a weaving stagger and a girl
that must be watched every moment
stronk had his hands full now and
then he would curse kay with fluent
wrath for insisting upon sitting down
to rest astra was hawk-like in her
vigilance at the first opportunity she
was determined that she would make a
break and try to reach the camp once
there she had no fear of stronk he
had tied a stout cord about one of her
wrists and tied the other end to his
own if only she could get loose from
that cord she would take a chance upon
out-running him for this reason she
offered no resistance husbanding her
energy for the moment when it might
mean freedom

  five miles from the planes anchorage
kay slumped down on the ground and
refused to go any farther he was not
altogether sober nor was he as drunk
as he had been the long walk had done
much to kill the strength of the liquors
effect but he had reached that stage
where he was surly and defiant he
demanded a drink and stronk refused
it stronk intended that kay should
have the pint later on as a bracer he
would need it before he would be able
to make the trip now it would but
serve to throw him back into drunken-
ness where he would be useless

  while stronk debated between using
his fists upon kay or leaving him
lay kay settled the question by falling
asleep there was little likelihood that
he would awaken before stronk could
return for him stronk cursed the snor-
ing kay and moved on with astra
astra took hope something might yet
turn up stronk told her his plan he
would take her to the plane bind her
and leave her in the rear cock-pit while
he returned for kay

  but all hope fled after they reached
the plane and stronk had trussed her
up he bound her arms close to her
sides and fastened her ankles together

he placed her in the rear cock-pit and
covered it over with a tarpaulin that was
secured and held down on all sides by
snaps in her trussed and cramped
condition she was far from comfortable
and all hope of escaping unaided fled
for the first time her thoughts centered
upon kay

  kay had repulsed her by his drunken-
ness yet remembering the girl he had
talked about in his maudlin maunderings
she felt a certain degree of pity for him
garbled though it was astra had been
able to piece kays story together
enough to understand that he had taken
to drink because a woman had proved
unfaithful to him she had heard
stories of men who had taken to drink
for that reason but astra knew little
of men his diatribe against women
she considered the effect of the liquor
that he hated all women seemed incon-
ceivable but under any circumstances
it was toward kay that she must look
for aid now if he carried her aboard
the ship her last hope would be gone
but she vowed to herself that the pic-
ture stronk had painted of a moon-lit
deck would never be a reality then a
chagrined flush overspread her face
there was something in her back-pocket
that was causing her discomfort she
had not thought of it once at a time
when it might have been of service nor
had stronk discovered it it was her
automatic

  despite her intention to remain awake
and the uncomfortable quarters astra
fell into a fretful slumber that day
she had worked hard upon the claim
which her fathers leg prevented him
from doing and then she was worn out
completely by the long hike she was
awakened by hearing voices not three
feet distant from her

  one of the things that booze does to
a man stronk she recognized kays
voice but you say the girl is the only
one i told and since we have her there
hasnt been any harm done she cant
get away from the ship

  theres only one bad feature about


air stories

the whole thing kay it isnt exactly
common-sense to take that girl aboard
among that crew of hyenas it might
cause trouble and we cant afford any
trouble youd better remain aboard
the ship for a week anyway the woods
will be full of search-parties as soon
as shes missed come back a week
from today

  the best thing to do with the wo-
man astra shuddered at the hard
voice is to dump her into the sea

  youre dead set against women
kay but ill gamble that even you
wouldnt throw this one into the sea
take a look at her shes sleeping

  theyre all alike kay said harshly
i wouldnt particularly care about
dumping her overboard but it would
be small loss for gods sake let me
have another pull at that flask i must
have had an awful cargo aboard last
night

  fear anger horror gripped astra
it did not seem possible for anyone to
speak of murder in the cold-blooded
manner kay had and there had been
something in his voice when he said it
that convinced astra that he was speak-
ing his convictions what a terrible
canker there must be upon a mans soul
who could speak of taking human life
so cold-bloodedly how far down in
depravity must he have descended since
he had become sodden with alcohol in
order that he might forget a woman

  stronk and kay had walked beyond
ear-shot and it was a long time before
they moved toward her again with a
sinking sensation in the pit of her
stomach she realized that kay was
climbing into the cock-pit ahead of her
she heard stronks voice call out and
kays reply then came kays cry of
contact and the motors roared into
her ears she was jerked forward as
the plane skimmed across the lake and
then she felt herself going up    up
and she fainted

  to have reached a point on land
opposite the falcon would have required
climbing high snow-bound mountains

and crossing dangerous glacier crevas-
ses  at the least it would have required
a months travel from the gold-camp
the hydro-plane traveling as the crow
would fly required less than two hours
for astra it was two hours filled with
chilling horror any minute she ex-
pected kay to turn-turtle and upset her
into the sea when at last she was
lifted from the cock-pit by two of the
falcons crew she was hysterical kay
had paid no attention to her beyond or-
dering the two sailors to bring her
aboard the boat with the plane safely
anchored a short distance from the ship
kay went below to see lorngen

   he found him sprawled out in a chair
in his cabin a sly grin on his coarse
features

  see you brought a little playmate
along kay he nodded toward the
berth with a chuckle i never could
figure how a man could hate women like
you said you did we all fall sooner
or later eh

  kay sat down with his back to the
bunk facing the captain she belongs
to stronk he said curtly

   how does stronk figure that hes go-
ing to be able to join his light of love-
but then he doesnt know does he of
our little plan well ignorance is
bliss

  kay laughed shortly stronk has
been doing some thinking upon his own
part his mind runs in the same groove
as ours

  an ugly light sprang into lorngens
swinish eyes for a moment

   there isnt any room for him aboard
the falcon a two-way split is enough

  well cap kay shrugged it
doesnt matter to me but for some
reason or other i have a hunch that ab-
bott himself hasnt played all of his
cards yet it doesnt seem plausible
that hed send us up here on a mission
like this without holding one card up
his sleeve i have an idea that he has
considered the possibility of the fal-
cons heading elsewhere than toward
frisco
north of the stars



  the captain shook his head sagely
abbott would have come with us if
he could have but he couldnt get away
from frisco he never figgers that we
might try to double-cross him he thinks
hes second in command to the devil
when it comes to putting the fear into a
man no abbott isnt going to lose any
sleep thinking wed double-cross him
not until we fail to show up and then
its too late

  then hell send his men scouring the
ports of the world for us kay replied
dryly we can expect a knife or a
bullet in the back sooner or later

  all wrong the captain smiled
abbott isnt going to know we ever
reached a port were going to hit south
keep out of sight and in time the falcon
will be reported lost by the survivor
who carries the story

  clever kay agreed but for my
part i believe that abbott is a shrewder
man than youre giving him credit for
being

  the captain got to his feet and looked
toward the bunk

  ive got to attend to a few things
about the ship he said moving toward
the door the crew is getting restless
from this long lay-to and ive thought
some of moving in closer and giving
them a chance to gambol ashore they
cant go nowhere but itll be a change
and therell be no desertion in these
waters

  kay nodded and reached for the flask
that set upon the table the captain
looked at him with an evil smirk

  take care of your playmate he
leered shes pretty much worn out
over the rough treatment youve handed
her and she needs consolation

  astras bonds had been removed when
she was brought aboard and she had
been placed in the captains berth she
had heard every word spoken by lom-
gen and kay but she thought it better
to feign unconsciousness she realized
now that her only hope lay in kay
if she failed to make him return her
to the camp she was determined that

she would grasp the opportunity and
make a break overland the captain
had said that he was going to move in
so the men could go ashore that would
be her chance she shuddered as she
thought of the thick-lipped captain who
had leered down at her when she lay
so he thought unconscious that it
would be possible for kay to ignore her
entreaties to take her back seemed quite
likely considering his attitude hereto-
fore most men she had known had
shown too much attention toward her
kay had not as much as looked toward
her

  with noiseless caution she raised her
head from the pillow and looked to-
ward kay he was seated with his
back to her but she could see that one
hand was grasping the bottle the other
a glass but he sat as though lost in
reverie or deep study then suddenly he
laughed harshly and poured himself a
drink gulping it down a long while
he remained seated and then with
a quick movement he sprang to his
feet astra lay back and closed her
eyes

  she sensed that he was standing be-
side the berth she could feel that his
eyes were fastened upon her after a
few moments he sat down on the edge
of the berth very slowly astra
opened her eyes and stared at him with
well-feigned dazedness that gradually
grew into startled fear

  kays lips quirked into a bitter harsh
smile he got to his feet

  do you want a drink he asked
coldly

  her lips curled scornfully

  a drink she spat the word con-
temptuously save your pig-swill to
keep your own filthy soul wallowing in
the slime

  i didnt mean whiskey he sneered
its much too precious to waste on a
woman

  something suddenly snapped within
her her violet eyes blazed into mad
flame with a leap she sprang from
the berth and confronted him her cap


air stories

was gone her gold-bronze hair fell about

her shoulders in wild disarray her face
had grown suddenly bloodless

  you brute  she screamed all of
her control swept away ive heard
your drunken curses against women
ive listened to your maudlin self-pity-
ing excuses-now youll fight fight
do you hear she screamed crouching
before him like a snarling tigress and
ill batter your whiskey-sodden face into
a resemblance of the beast that you are
ill hammer the fear of god into your
depraved soul

  kay stared at her in speechless amaze-
ment not unmingled with awe she
was like some beautiful goddess of
wrath or a jungle she-cat whose young
have been taken from her her lips
were quivering her eyes aflame he
took a backward step and she was upon
him

  small fists crashed into his face all
of the power of her supple body behind
them he attempted to grab her arms
but she was away and back again like
a wind-washed wave breaking against a
rock her fists battered into his face
crashed his lips against his teeth her
voice screamed at him in fury he man-
aged to grasp her by the collar but she
sprang away the shirt ripping down one
shoulder with a sudden leap he man-
aged to grasp her in his arms pinioning
her own against her sides she writhed
in his embrace her eyes burning
into his like pools of wind-swept
flame his arms tightened about her
while his breath came in labored
gasps

  now he gasped ill pour that
drink down your throat

  you coward she hissed you
miserable depraved coward i could
kill you  she struggled against his arms
and kicked at him with all her might
then suddenly she sank her teeth into
his arm with a cry of pain his hold
relaxed and she sprang away

  she crouched a pace away from him
an unholy light in her eyes the wild
fighting blood of long-forgotten sander-

sons coursed madly through her veins
she was a wild creature of the jungle
all vestige of civilization swept from
her she taunted him laughed at him
and sent those small lists crashing again
and again into his face two small
streams of blood trickled from the cor-
ners of his mouth he felt weak dizzy
she was but a blurred figure weaving
and rushing before him he had not
struck back at her-he wondered why-
he was not angry and he did not under-
stand that

  as she rushed toward him again her
foot caught in the corner of a rug and
she tripped he sprang forward to cap-
ture her but even as she hit the floor
on hands and knees she was struggling
to her feet he bent over to grasp her
arms and she whirled upon her back and
lay flat drawing her legs up like the
half-closed blade of a jack-knife he
made a dart to catch her and two small
moccasin-clad feet rammed into the pit
of his stomach the unexpectedness
of the blow caught him off balance and
sent him reeling backward a groping
hand caught at the table and grasped its
edge he stumbled and sprawled to the
floor the table crashing down with him
he lay motionless

  astra sprang to her feet and advanced
toward him warily expecting some
trick but he did not move as she bent
over him her face went deathly white
from his temple a thin trickle of blood
coursed into a pool upon the floor a
moment she bent over him and then
she fell down beside him and took his
head into her lap she looked into the
pale blood-smeared face at the torn
lips and suddenly she broke into hys-
terical sobs

  she looked up after a long time to
find lorngen standing in the doorway
confronting her with an evil leer but
there was an expression of amazement
in his eyes as he surveyed the disheveled
girl and the man upon the floor a sar-
donic smile of comprehension parted his
thick lips

  so he didnt hate you so much after
north of the stars



all eh probably tried to play too
rough

  he bent over kay and then looked at
the girl with a low whistle of amaze-
ment

  i-is he    dead  her voice qua-
vered in a strained whisper

  dead  lorngen bent down no
but ill bet hell wish he was when he
learns what a whale of a trimmin you
give him an me not here to see it
looks like you chewed him up and spit
him out

  please her voice was husky with
tremors of fear help me get him onto
the bed

  lorngen stooped down picked up
kay and waddled to the bunk with him
he turned back to astra with an ex-
pression in his beady eyes that caused
her to cringe back

  youre the kind i like his thick
lips parted in what he intended for a
smile of approval but vhich reminded
astra of the leering smirk of a gorilla
you and me would hook up fine

  please get me some water and some-
thing to bandage his head with d-do
you think whiskey 

  sure the captain chuckled whis-
key will be the first thing he asks for
its the only thing he ever thinks of

  after lorngen went for water and
bandage astra sat down upon the edge
of the bunk and looked down upon the
wan blood-streaked face of kay he
began to mutter and astra leaned closer

 it was not the maundering of a
drunken man now it was the delirium-
dream of a man carried back into other
years astra felt hot tears course dowm
her cheeks as kay lived over and gave
utterance to that parting of long ago

  he opened his eyes slowly and blinked
dazedly at the vision leaning above him
a single shaft of sunlight streamed
through the open port-hole and show-
ered through gold-bronzed hair like a
mist of flame-struck opal dust tender
tear-wet eyes were looking into his and
one small hand was caressing his fore-
head it was many moments before

comprehension came to him and then
he smiled wanlv

  i    didnt pour it down your
throat    did i  he said wanly
please get me a drink

  she brought a bottle and glass from
the locker and poured him a drink he
gulped it down and handed the glass
back to her she poured another drink
and as he reached for it she lifted it to
her own lips and gulped it as the fiery
liquid ran down her throat she gagged
and went into paroxysms of strangling
coughs her eyes met his and there was
a thin veil of moisture over them

  i-ive drank it v she whispered
will you take me back surely you
wouldnt keep me here for    for-
her voice broke and she looked at him
appealingly

  a long moment he looked at her and
then he got slowly from the bunk and
stood swaying unsteadily before her he
nodded his head in a slow affirmative
yes he said ill take you to the
mainland

chapter vii
ship ahoy

a large cold-gleaming moon crept
from beyond the horizon and laid
a carpet of rippling light across the blue
waters of the bering in the shadows
on the lee side of the falcon kay
leaned upon the rail looking off to
where the moon-stream wras lost amid
the murk that hovered over the coast-
line

  many thoughts were passing through
his mind none of them pleasant for
six years he had been but an atom of
flotsam drifting with the current he
had told abbott that he had no scruples
against crime he had readily agreed
with lorngen and stronk to double-
cross abbott he would have double-
crossed lorngen and stronk with the
same lack of compunction he had no
definite object in mind for which he


air stories

would use his share of the gold in fact
he had given little thought to the pos-
sibility of wealth ht possessed no am-
bition no goal no desire to exert an
effort toward climbing back to respect-
ability or manhood he accepted himself
for what he was a drunkard a faint
flush overspread his face as he raised
a hand and touched the bandage about
his head he wanted to feel angry
retributive toward the girl for taking
advantage of him but had she taken
advantage of him she had not ex-
pected him to remain passive she had
thought that he would fight back why
hadnt he fought back he held women
in contempt hated them perhaps a
man would not strike a woman-but he
had no manhood and as all of these
thoughts passed through his mind there
was a vague indefinite undercurrent in
his thought-stream that he refused to
bring to the surface there had been
something in the pathetic wistfulness
of the girls eyes something in the way
that she had looked at him that had
stirred memories and he had thought
those memories buried too deep to ever
be resurrected he realized that he had
been a fool a damnable fool but the
realization angered him-angered him
that he should admit them he made
no resolve to forget the past and start
anew there was nothing for him to
go back to nothing to be gained in
fighting back to the man that he had
once been he was thinking of the
futility of the life that he was living
the utter uselessness of living longer
he was thinking many thoughts that
were strange to him and he was consid-
ering seriously and unemotionally the
eternal rest from it all that lay beneath
those blue waters that lapped at the
vessels side he was startled by a soft
foot-fall behind him and a small hand
touching him upon the shoulder

   kay astra whispered her eyes
looking at him in a frightened appeal
i-im afraid down there the cap-
tain and most of the crew are drunk
and-

  and what has that to do with me
he asked coldly i havent agreed to
act as your bodyguard i  take you
ashore tomorrow as i agreed thats
all i have promised

  she cringed away from him an ex-
pression of horror and disbelief in her
eyes

  you wouldnt protect me from-
  why should i he asked gruffly
  because youre a man

  a man he laughed harshly
there is nothing subtle about your
irony

  you mean- her lips grew taut
and she looked at him from fear-filled
eyes that you would leave me to pro-
tect myself against those   swine
filthy beasts that are wallowing in rot-
ten whiskey

  you forget he said curtly that i
belong to the same drove swine who
wallow in whiskey

  but at least you    you wouldnt
harm me her voice fell to a husky
whisper

  harm you he studied her closer
in the moonlight a hard glint coming
into his narrowed eyes id break
your heart if i could he said with a
tense hardness

  why kay    why    what
have i done to you she whispered
with a catch in her voice ive never
harmed you

  you believe he said in a harsh
voice that i started drinking to forget
a woman i thought so myself once
but it wasnt because a woman pre-
ferred money to love that i wanted to
forget her it wasnt a woman that i
lost it was an ideal a dream when
i saw the world turned into a slaughter
house saw men torn into atoms and
their blood spattering over shell-torn
fields when i saw all this horror and
hatred and thought of all the horror and
misery that must come to the loved ones
of those slain men-when i saw all that
there still remained a vision thaf in-
spired me to believe that not all the
world was filled with hatred murder
north of the stars



and broken faith

  he paused and astra looking into his
eyes saw a kindling flame a passionate
hopeless appeal in mitigation of what
he was an appeal in his own defence
a moment his eyes burned into hers
and then he turned away with a bitter
laugh

  and that ideal that vision  what was
it after all he turned to face her
fiercely a woman that sold herself
for a pot of gold but it wasnt that
woman that i wanted to forget i had
built an idol to the goddess of all that
was good and pure and faith he
laughed harshly i believed in her
worshipped her and she-sold herself
for a pot of gold

  b-but kay one small hand crept
up his arm and rested upon his shoul-
der not all women are that way not
every woman would sell herself for a
pot of gold

  theyd sell their immortal souls for
an ermine coat and a line in the society
columns he said bitterly all of
them and then with a sudden change
in his voice he reached into his pocket
and handed her a key go to my cabin 
lock the door upon the inside no harm
will come to you there then as she
started away ill take you ashore to-
morrow

  oh she uttered in a joyous cry
y-you would trust me not to tell
about the gold you would trust me
kay

  i would trust no woman he said
grimly i said id take you ashore
ill take you far enough away from the
camp to insure your not reaching there
before we are away from here with the
gold

  you mean- she asked in a horror-
strained voice that you would leave me
out there alone to find my way back
ill see that you have everything you
need provisions and directions or
would you rather remain here he
asked grimly

  no no she cried take me any-
where away from these 

  swine he completed with a dry
laugh

  look she cried suddenly pointing
off toward the south i see a light
its a ship there was a great relief
in that last sentence

  kay whirled about and stared off in
the direction she pointed he laughed
shortly so abbott isnt a fool hes
coming to play his own cards in this
little game of ours

  astras eyes were fastened upon the
distant beam of light that was bobbing
like a firefly upon the waters

  abbott she said with sinking
heart but perhaps hope sprang into
her words it is someone else some-
one that wouldnt leave a woman to
find her way over miles of deathtraps
alone

  it might be he agreed calmly i
doubt it ive always felt that abbott
was too shrewd a man to trust a thing
like this to hirelings he couldnt come
at the start but hes going to be in at the
finish-which will disappoint lomgen
and stronk he completed with a grim
chuckle

  oh but if its only someone else
she breathed hopefully someone that
isnt contaminated by rotten whiskey
and the lust for gold i pray god that
it isnt abbott

  and i dont give a damn one way
or the other said kay as he turned
upon his heel and made his way toward
the companionway

        chapter viii
        now you die

kay had been correct it was ab-
bott  and kay chuckled sardoni-
cally at the baffled expression of rage
that overspread lomgens face when
he went on deck and discovered that it
was abbott hailing the falcon but all
was not lost yet much could happen
even to abbott before the gold was
delivered in frisco the one thing that


air stories

bothered the captain was the fact that
he had disobeyed abbotts orders about
the aviator if abbott was to discover
that he had not followed orders there
would be trouble

  hes not such a fool eh cap kay
chuckled

  no lorngens brutal face con-
torted into a malevolent grimace we
arent going to let abbott snatch a for-
tune away from us are we hell more
than likely be alone

  kay did not reply but walked off to
his own cabin he turned the knob and
then remembered that he had sent astra
there

  its only me he called abbott
has arrived to look out for his own

  he thought he heard a sob from be-
yond the door but she made no reply
to him he went back to the captains
cabin and sat down at the table

  well abbott he looked up with a
sarcastic smile as abbott followed lorn-
gen into the cabin i see that you arent
trusting your honorable colleagues any
too far

  hello kay abbott dropped into
the seat opposite and smiled in an
amused way his glittering eyes apprais-
ing kay with unfeigned approval
youre looking more like a man kay
no it wasnt that i distrusted any of
you i thought perhaps i might be of
some help its a big thing we have
ahead of us-too big to risk a failure

  kay looking beyond abbott saw the
brutal face of lorngen smirking sarcas-
tically the captain nodded to kay in
a meaning way and slowly closed one
eyelid

  although abbott said dryly its
a great temptation so much gold ships
have been known to lose their course
go upon the rocks sink-most anything
might happen to a vessel that carries
such precious cargo he turned to
look toward the captain but lorngen
had left the cabin this voyage seems
to have benefited you you look more
like a human

  yes kay nodded with a satiric

  smile i have been greatly benefited
the benefit would have been greater
though had you postponed your visit i
had visions of waving palms rum-
just another shattered dream  he said
with mock regret

  what do you mean abbott
straightened in his chair his eyes nar-
rowing

  just what i said kays eyes met
the others piercing stare i told you
at the beginning of this proposition that

i	had no morals no scruples i was seri-
ously considering encountering one of
the catastrophes you mentioned a mo-
ment ago-shipwreck

  abbott stared at him in dumfoimded
perplexity

  you mean he said finally you
were going to double-cross me

  exactly

  and why are you telling me ab-
bott asked curiously

  why not you knew i would given
the chance thats why you came up
here your claim is no better than mine
you double-crossed someone else to-

  ill be damned abbott sprang to
his feet an angry color mounting into
his cheeks his eyes glowered at kay
menacingly that bull-necked ape
lorngen told you about the other
aviator eh you two wrere going to
double-cross me after what ive done
for you

  youve done nothing for me abbott
except in so far as it furthered your
own plans under the same circum-
stances were you and i in reversed posi-
tions you would do the same thing it
could hardly be called double-crossing
just taking advantage of an opportu-
nity

  for a moment abbott stood speech-
less his aloe-like eves fastened upon
kay searchingly abbott knew men
and he suspected some unspoken reason
behind kays confession that there
was some motive behind this challenge
-for challenge it was-abbott was
sure

  why he said finally keeping the
north of the stars



rage from his voice are you telling
me

  because i am through with your
plan abbott i have a better one of
my own i have become possessed of
the strange and improbable hallucina-
tion that i am a man i admit that it
sounds ridiculous it probably is but it
stands ill have nothing to do with
your deal any longer

  a sardonic leer twisted at abbotts
lips and he laughed

  you need the plane to get the gold
kay i have a man aboard the ship
that brought me that can sail the plane
i also have men that-

  the ship that brought you is sailing
southward abbott your bluff is no
good there isnt anything that you
can do to stop me

  abbotts face turned a fiery hue his
eyes narrowed to pinpoints of flame
his voice came low hard tense

 you are wrong kay there is
something i can do and i am going to
do it-i can kill you right now

       chapter ix
       its your battle

when kay had knocked upon the
door and announced that the ves-
sel had brought abbott astra threw
herself across the bunk and sobbed for
a moment she had dared hope that res-
cue was at hand but now she faced a
fate little better than throwing herself
in the bering would offer to make
her way alone over two hundred miles
of glaciers and through a strange coun-
try seemed impossible

  after a long while she raised her
head there was a light of desperation
in her eyes she was determiined to
make some effort toward getting kay
to take her ashore there was some-
thing about kay that frightened her
repulsed her and yet strangely caused
her to pity him something in his eyes
deep down had seemed to deny the

harshness of his words his inhuman
callousness it was something wistful
poignant-the struggle of a soul trying
to fight free from intangible bonds

  she opened the cabin door softly and
looked up and down the passageway it
was deserted from the focsle came
the raucous guffaws and loud voices of
the crew clutching her small auto-
matic astra made her way stealthily up
the companionway

  keeping in the shadows she reached
a point beneath an open porthole of the
captains cabin and peered in she saw
abbott and kay and heard kay tell ab-
bott that he was through incredulity
and amazement overspread her face a
joyous hope sprang up in her breast
perhaps after all he would take her
back to the camp

  when abbotts hand jerked up with
a revolver and he uttered the threat to
kill kay astras small automatic was on
a line with abbotts heart her finger
pressing against the trigger but ab-
bott made no effort to fire the hand
holding the revolver dropped to his side
he sat down at the table a sardonic
twist at the corners of his lips

  and what has brought about this
sudden redemption  he sneered this
idea that you are going to be a man

  astra did not hear kays reply be-
cause at that moment a step sounded
behind her before she could whirl to
confront the prowler strong arms were
about her she fought and struggled
to free herself but lorngens laugh
mocked her efforts

  take it easy little one ill take
you in where you can hear things bet-
ter he dragged her to the cabin door
and thrust her inside

  what the- abbott had whirled
at the sudden commotion and now stared
at astra in blank amazement and then
an understanding light came into his
eyes so thats the answer he
snarled at kay how in hell did she
get here he roared at lorngen

  kay brought her today stronk sent
her 


air stories

  stronk eh  black rage came into
abbotts face why did you bring
her he whirled upon kay

  had to kay replied she knew
our plans

  stronk told her a dangerous
gleam came into the dark eyes

  no i did

  you damn you kay if i didnt
intend to kill you before i do now so
you dont hate them so damn much after
all do you he sneered

  astras eyes were fastened upon kay
with an expression of intermingling
hope and desperation lorngen had
taken her gun away from her and re-
tained a vise-like grip upon her wrist

  kay looked at abbott and there was
a hard glint in his eyes

  more abbott as much as you are
going to hate me when you see this gold
torn from your grasp you couldnt
help but hate any man that took gold
from you

  you talk like a damn fool abbott
sneered but a startled expression flitted
through his eyes in his rage he had
forgotten that the gold could not be
brought aboard without kays help he
did not know that lorngen had not
killed the other aviator

  lorngen threw a meaning glance at
kay he wanted kay to start things
and then he would watch his chance
and finish abbott that would leave
the field clear for the captain to send
kay back to the mainland and make
final arrangements with stronk once
those arrangements were made
kay would have served his only
useful function in the plans of the
captain

  a thin smile quirked at abbotts lips
as he turned to face the girl a mo-
ment he stared at her while her eyes
blazed into his then he turned to face
kay whose gaze was fastened upon the
night beyond the porthole

  so kay abbott laughed softly
this is the mornings-after eye-opener
one woman sends you on a six years
drunk and the other sobers you up to a

point where you begin to think you can
be a man

  well forget about women abbott
kays gaze came to rest upon the smirk-
ing features you were speaking of
killing me a moment ago its an in-
triguing subject one that i have given
considerable thought to lately

  you abbott laughed scornfully
i told you once that you lacked the
guts to live and the nerve to die i
hoped i was wrong then i know i am
right now kay you havent even got
the makings of a man

  you lie astra cried her eyes pools
of blazing fire the cords standing out
against her white throat as she strained
toward abbott

  abbott laughed w ith a sneer but kay
straightened up in his chair and through
his eyes flitted an expression that was
hard to define but astra did not look
toward kay her eyes were still fastened
upon abbott abbott turned away
from her and spoke to kay

  were going ashore kay i want
to see stronk

  you can walk abbott kay got
to his feet and started toward the door

  for a moment abbotts eyes flamed in
mad rage and then with a leap he was in
front of kay the revolver pressed
against his stomach

  youll do as i say or ill-

  shoot kay sneered contemptu-
ously why in hell dont you do it
then youve been talking about it all
night kay thrust his hands deep into
his pockets and sneered into abbotts
eyes ill tell you why-youre think-
ing of gold but a sudden flame
came into kays eyes im going to do
just one thing before you have a chance
to shoot abbott-im going to hammer
that sneer off your face

  before abbott realized what kay in-
tended a fist caught him against the
jaw staggering him another blow and
kay had knocked the gun from his
hand for a moment abbott stared in
stupefied amazement unable to compre-
hend this sudden transformation in a
north of the stars



man who a short few weeks ago had
been a drunken sot cringing and begging
for small coins with which to buy liquor
but looking into kays eyes he saw that
the lack-lustre the wonted shiftiness
was gone and in its stead there was a
light that blazed bitter and deadly then
the broiling rage within abbott surged
to the surface he made a lunge his
fist shot out and struck kay across the
mouth reeling him backward

  you can do it kay whip hirra

  it was astra that called out to him
lorngen had released her and now she
stood body half-crouched small fists
clenched close to her waist her eyes
shining her face flushed in tense
interest

  lorngen folded his arms across his
chest an ironic smile quirking at the cor-
ners of his lips if kay saved him the
trouble of attending to abbott sc much
the better

  a fleeting moment the eyes of kay
and astra met and then abbott was
upon him but in that brief instant kay
had read an unvoiced plea in the eyes
of the girl he met abbotts rush with
a blow that sent the gambler reeling
backward there was venom mad-
hating rage in those aloe-like eyes now
and there was a cruel animal-like snarl
upon the thin lips again and again
kays fists crashed into the swarthy
face abbotts blows fell upon him
jarred him sent piercing pain into his
brain but still he kept weaving in and
out with a sudden spring abbott
clenched with him for a moment they
struggled and then crashed to the floor
with abbott on top quick as a flash
abbotts hand darted into his pocket
and came forth with a knife jerked from
a leather sheath within the pocket a
womans scream of horror sounded as
the yellow rays of the ceiling-lamp fell
upon the bare blade descending

  as though that cry were new energy
revitalizing him kays knee came up
and ramtaed into abbotts stomach with
terrific force the knife slipped from
his fingers and before he could regain

his breath kay rolled him oft and sprang
up and then with all the power he pos-
sessed kay sent a blow crashing to ab-
botts jaw abbott crawled to his hands
and knees and wobbled unsteadily kay
stood over him waiting abbott looked
toward the sardonic captain

  lorngen he gasped stop the
damn fool hold him

  lorngen laughed its your battle
abbott fight it

  yes damn you kay snarled
fight there isnt any makings of a
man in me eh damn you abbot
im going to kill you with my hands

  abbott came up with a spring but as
he rushed toward kay kay swung his
fist pivoting upon one heel the blow
caught abbott upon the point of the
jaw and this time he crashed to the
floor and lay motionless kay staggered
back and brushed a hand across his eyes
to clear away the blood that trickled
from an open cut above his eye he
reeled through the door without a back-
ward glance toward astra or the cap-
tain

  kay astra sprang forward
where are you going

  to get a drink he laughed harshly

  kay kay she was beside him
her small hand clutching his arm
dont go back to wallowing in the mire
youve taken the first step up dont go
down again

  he brushed her off roughly and
lurched down the passageway to his
cabin

  lorngen laughed sardonically as astra
turned away with a sob catching in her
throat

  its the one thing that he cant whip
the booze god imagine that drunken
bum putting up such a battle after he
let you hammer hell out of him he
sneered

  kay slumped down upon his bunk
and removed a pint flask from beneatli
his mattress he raised the bottle to his
lips and then paused a long while he
sat thus and then with a dry laugh he
replaced the cork and slipped the bottle

into his pocket he heard hurried foot-
steps and looked up to see the excited
face of lorngen standing in the door-
way

  its come kay he cried snow 
shes coming down fast too well be
having that gold aboard this week
youd better go back and see stronk
no use taking chances that they will
start with that gold before were ready
kay nodded what about abbott
he asked

  lorngen laughed sardonically ab-
bott is safely locked up well give
him a ticket later on-a lead ticket about
his feet

ill go back tonight kay started
remove his flying-clothes from their
peg and then turned to face lorngen
tell the girl to be ready in half an
hour put a parachute on her and-
youre a fool kay lorngen blazed
angrily shell tell the whole camp
yes when she gets there that will
be after we have the gold aboard

  you mean lorngen cast a startled
glance at him that you are going to
maroon her out there

  no kay laughed grimly i am
going to give her a compass food and
directions as to how to reach the camp
she can get there in a five-days walk
itll do her good

  lorngen stared at himj curiously
you mean that you would let a girl
like her go wandering off through the
wilds

  like her kays lips curled why
like her is she any different than
others 

  why shes got the looks of a beauty
prize winner youd be a fool to take
her back an evil gleam crept into
the captains eyes and he leered at kay
if you dont want her i-

   i said i was going to take her back
kay snapped back she goes with me
tonight

  lorngen started to make an angry
retort and then thought better of it
why risk the gold for one woman
there were plenty just as beautiful

where the palms waved over southern

seas

  howll you get your bearings to-
night 

  theres a moon kay replied i
wont need much light to make a land-
ing on the lake theres a level stretch
of country between here and there where
i can drop the girl its about a hun-
dred miles from the camp and she wont
miake it in less than five days maybe
longer tell her to get ready

  lorngen shrugged and turned upon
his heel youre a fool kay but
youre the doctor-right now anyway
he muttered the last under his breath
my turn comes later

       chapter x
       winged flame

when kay came on deck ready
for the air he found astra stand-
ing by the rail her face pale in the
moonlight that bathed the night in an
eerie twilight she raised fear-filled
eyes to him and her lips quivered

  k-kay her voice quavered you
arent going to-to-

  do you want to stay here he asked
bruskly you can do as you wish
b-but i-im afraid

  ignoring her cry kay made his way
toward the ladder that led to the hydro-
plane which had been drawn close along-
side the falcon ready to descend he
looked toward her

  im ready to leave he called un-
emotionally youd better let me give
you directions about pulling that release
cord on the parachute

  while the girl cringed against the rail
in abject fear and horror kay ex-
plained the manipulation of the para-
chute as matter-of-factly as though he
were explaining it to a class in aviation

  oh kay- a sob caught in her
throat and for a moment she struggled
to speak you couldnt leave me out
there alone please ill say nothing
north of the stars



to anyone about what you are going to
do take me back to camp please

kay j

  she clutched his arm and looked up
at him through tear-wet eyes kays
face turned a trifle pale and he clenched
his hands until his fingers bit into the
palms he averted his face and spoke
gruffly

  no harm will come to you

  b-but its snowing    i-i-
kay laughed harshly snowing
ive flown when the air was full of fly-
ing steel a little snow doesnt matter
how you must hate me she cried
with a sob and ive never done any-
thing to deserve it

  hate you he turned upon her
fiercely and grasped her shoulders in a
clutch that caused her to wince in pain
hate you  i-i dont hate you i-
come on he broke off abruptly and
started down the ladder

  a startled expression came into as-
tras eyes a moment she remained too
surprised to move and then she followed
him down the ladder kay climbed into
the cockpit and said nothing as astra
took her seat beside him instead of
climbing into the rear cockpit kay
looked up toward the deck of the fal-
con the captains cabin-door opened
and lorngen stepped out

  all right cap kay called give
her a whirl

  youre a damn fool kay lorngen
snapped as he took hold of the propeller
blade and gave it a wind

  youre wrong captain kay
laughed harshly i have been

  the motors took hold with a sudden
roar and the hydroplane skimmed along
upon the surface of the water for a
hundred yards before her nose lifted
into the air and she gradually climbed
upward far off hanging low in the
northern sky one lone star stood senti-
nel over a snow-capped peak of distant
mountains

  astras face was bloodless her eyes
were fastened upon the man beside her
kays eyes were straight ahead he

   a- s-aug-

seemed oblivious to the terror-stricken
little figure that cowered beside him
once astra tried to raise her voice
above the roar of the motors but it was
drowned out before it passed her lips
there was no wind yet the terrific speed
of the plane drove the snow against
them as though it were blizzard-driven

  how long they roared on through the
night astra never knew to her it
seemed eternity an eternity wherein an
ever-impending doom cast a nameless
terror upon her suddenly kay seemed
to stiffen he stooped low and studied
the instrument board and then he darted
a swift glance at the girl then he
leaned toward her and placed his mouth
against her ear

  quick he cried climb over
dont forget about the cord be sure
youre clear before you pull it

  it seemed that in that moment her
heart stopped her muscles seemed
grown paralyzed she stared at him in
wide-eyed horror she cried out in
mortal dread but her voice never
reached his ears she saw his face
tense with a quick miovement he re-
leased the controls and grasped her
another instant he was forcing her over
the side the plane wobbled dizzily
and he grabbed the control stick with
one hand and steadied it

  quick he screamed into her ear
im almost out of gas well be drop-
ping soon    cant land    youre
safe with the parachute drop and
then as her terror-stricken eyes stared
into his he lifted her over the side

  a scream of horror w-as stifled in her
throat she felt as though she were
rushing downward into a bottomless
void it was like some nightmarish
dream she saw the snow-covered
ground rushing up to meet her then
with a desperate effort she yanked upon
the metal ring about the cord there
came a mighty wrench as though her
shoulders were being jerked and torn
asunder the speed of her descent
slackened  the parachute had opened and
she was floating down now slowly and


air stories

safely then almost beside her came
a roar and from the skies a streaming
oriflamme of fire streaked earthward
even in that moment of horror and
terror she knew that kay was crashing
to death in the plane merciful uncon-
sciousness came over her

  the parachute fluttered and then
slowly settled over the motionless form
upon the ground a hundred yards
away a twisted heap of metal lay glow-
ing as the last tongues of flame died
out

  it was a long time before astra
stirred and slowly opened her eyes she
felt the silken heap lying on top of
her and for a moment lay in dazed in-
comprehension  and then the full reali-
zation of the last few minutes of horror
in the air came to her she struggled
to her feet and crept from beneath the
parachute she saw the smouldering
heap upon which the snowflakes fell
with a hiss of steam as they touched the
hot metal

chapter xi

wrecked t

a moment astra stood staring at
that mangled heap of steel her
face was a ghastly white her heart filled
with an unspeakable dread it was all
like a delirium-hallucination the weird
moonlight filtering through the silent
feathery snowfall the distant peaks of
phantom-like mountains and about her
the eerie whiteness of the motionless
world a half-cry of hysteria came
from between her bloodless lips as her
eyes searched in fascinated dread be-
yond that tangled network of what had
been the plane a figure a black blot
against the snow lay far away from the
wrecked plane astra took a step for-
ward and then paused she feared to
look down into the face of that motion-
less form a paralysis of fright pos-
sessed her and then a force greater
than the fear of looking into the face

of death caused her to advance slowly

step by step as though she were stalk-
ing a phantom she halted a few paces
away from kay who lay face down-
ward

  kay the cry was tom from her
heart a cry of anguish fear she threw
herself forward beside him and sobbed

kay kay her cry was hysterical
laughter and sobs mingling in uncon-
trollable paroxysms a groan had come
from kay

  to fall three thousand feet in a crash-
ing plane and not be killed would be a
miracle but in kays case the miracle
was that he had been able to glide to
earth in a plane that was in flames the
hydroplane had not been equipped for
landing on anything except water and
the moment the pontoons touched the
ground they were snapped loose while
kay was catapulted through the air to
strike the ground far beyond the blaz-
ing plane he owed his life to his well-
padded helmet and his heavy clothing

  she took his head in her lap he
began to mutter in broken incoherent
sentences wild maunderings from which
astra glimpsed scenes from other days
and listening to him the tears coursed
unabashed down her cheeks she be-
lieved kay to be dying any other result
from the crash seemed impossible

  she raised her head and stared wildly
off through the snowing night if she
could only get him where he might be
taken care of properly there might be
a chance of saving him for the first
time she realized that kay meant some-
thing to her back there on the ship
he had been a means of her own salva-
tion  now her own plight seemed insig-
nificant compared to saving kays life
how  she had no conception of where
they were nor how far away the camp
might be

  through abbott   kay began
once more to talk going to take her
back to camp    dont want a drink 
he struck out violently with one hand
no no he half struggled up and
reached out a restraining hand dont
north of the stars



leave me astra f i dont hate you   
i was  again he fell back weakly
and lay quiet

  the girl fell into sobbing and pressed
her cheek against his im not going
to leave you kay

  as though her voice had aroused him
he brushed a hand across his eyes and
blinked up at her dazedly after a long
while his lips moved and she bent close
to catch his words

  we  we crashed he said weak-
ly almost got there    ten miles
   safe on lake tired    want
sleep    lake ten miles north   
stronk waiting    wait long time

  a sudden wild surge of hope sprang
up within her it was only ten miles
to the lake or-and for a moment she
lost hope-was kay only speaking at
random in his delirium but anything
was better than waiting out here she
must bring help if kay was to be saved
he was probably injured internally per-
haps there were bones broken he
would not be able to walk she could not
carry him she must get help stronk 
stronk would be waiting at the lake
she was thinking fast now she would
go to the lake and find stronk tell
him that kay had fallen but that the
plane was uninjured if for no other
reason stronk would help her to get
kay in in order that the gold could be
stolen were he to learn that the plane
was destroyed he would not help her
but once she had brought him back to
where kay was she still had the small
automatic and stronk would carry kay
in or he would never leave him alive

  astra laid kay back upon the snow
and got to her feet looking about her
off in the north the same star still stood
sentinel over the snow-capped peak all
else was an eerie whiteness ten miles 
to her it seemed as though the world
stretched away into endless miles but
she must act she must try to reach the
lake and bring stronk

  she remembered the parachute and
went to fetch it from among the tan-
gled wreckage of the plane she removed

a steel rod she forced the rod into the
ground and draped the parachute over
it forming a shelter that would protect
kay from the snow then she removed
her heavy mackinaw and used it to cover
the ground with a great effort she
lifted kay and laid him upon the coat
he commenced muttering and astra
paused breathless hoping that he might
revive but he fell silent again and a
little sob escaped her lips

  and then with kay protected from
the weather as much as it was possible
for her to do she strode off through the
night not for a moment did she dis-
count the herculean task that lay before
her but it was the only chance and
though wearied and heartsick she
clenched her small fists and struggled
on

chapter xii
hang him

due to his inability to work his
claim incapacitated as he was by
a broken leg the camp had appointed
jim sanderson official caretaker of the
camps gold adjoining the cabin and
entered into by a door within the cabin
they had constructed a small shed jim
kept a record book and scales and as
each mans gold was put into the store-
house its weight and owner was entered
but both jim and astra had staked
claims adjoining those of bill travis
and astra had performed a mans work
in getting down to bed-rock on both
claims now and then she was given
a helping hand by travis or an adjoin-
ing neighbor one of those who had
rendered her much assistance was the
husband of the squaw from whose cabin
she was returning when she found kay
it so happened that upon that particular
night he decided to return to his own
cabin instead of remaining in camp as
was his custom the following morn-
ing when he returned he went to the
sanderson cabin to ask astra about
some medicine


air stories

  you say astra started home last
night jim demanded when the half-
breed had stated his mission my
god i the truth struck him all at
once send bill travis here he
roared in a voice that frightened the
indian

  but it was two hours later that travis
came he burst into the cabin like a
madman his face flushed his eyes
flaming

  by god jim weve struck it i he
cried not noticing the drawn face of
the older man millions man and
its as good on your an astras side
as-

  hell jim gave utterance to a re-
lieved sigh then thats what kept
astra out all night digging gold i
shes worse than her old dad

  travis stared at him blankly

  what you talking about jim  aint
astra been here

  t-then she aint been out on the
claim clammy fear clutched at jims
heart then stronk lias her go
and find stronk he roared find
him and bring him here i want to kill
him

  she might be at my cabin travis
replied

  she wouldnt be there all night
stronk lias her i might have known
thats what he came here for last night
bring him here god if it wasnt for
this leg all busted up

  while jim was forced to remain idle
in the search for astra the miners were
busy travis had passed the word
along that stronk had kidnapped the
sanderson girl it was an angry mob
that gathered in a cabin and listened to
their elected leader give his instructions

  and dont forget were the parting
words were going to divide up and
scour the woods the first party to get
him will string him up weve had
enough of his rot-gut whiskey and the
trouble its been causing

  at last there was a definite and justi-
fiable cause for stringing stronk up
men who had been cheated and robbed

at the gold lure were exulting that they
could even scores and remain within the
law of the camp to hang a man for
cheating at cards was one tiling to
hang a man for injuring a woman was
another thing altogether

  but even as the mob formed a hire-
ling of the gambler had raced away to
stronks cabin stronk cursed as he was
told about the mob he went into a mad
rage but not for long did he tarry
only too well did he know that the mob
would carry out their intention of hang-
ing him not only on account of the
girl but because there were many in that
mob who held private grudges against
him and as he cursed the mob he
cursed kay it had been his drunken
maundering that had made it neces-
sary to kidnap the girl in the first place
not that stronk had not intended to
kidnap her anyway but he would
have waited until die gold was safely
aboard

  but even as he prepared for flight
he chuckled it had begun to snow
last night and undoubtedly kay would
return immediately instead of waiting
the week as was intended stronk had
prepared for a contingency that might
prevent him from leing with the gold
train he had given full instructions
to a lieutenant about administering the
knockout drops and there was no chance
of die plan going awry as for kay-
stronks eyes narrowred-he would be
taken care of later

  it was still snowing heavily when
stronk reached the edge of the lake he
paused and looked back over the trail
h had traveled suddenly he gave a
surprised start and stared wide-eyed at
an apparition that staggered into view
it was kay

  kay lurched on until he came within
a few feet of stronk he halted and
tottered to the ground stronk sprang
forward and caught him about the
shoulders

 good god kay what has hap-
pened 

  crashed kay replied weakly i
north of the stars



walked    looking for astra   
she-

  astra stronk cried where is
she 

  found her way-to camp-guess
couldnt find-

  shes gone to camp an overpow-
ering rage took possession of the gam-
bler youve let her get away to warn
them damn you kay i should
have killed you a long time ago i didnt
because you were valuable if the plane
is wrecked you arent worth a damn to
me im going to have that gold ill
cache it until im able to get it out
damn you kay im going to kill you
as i should have done long ago

  but kay had not heard he lay un-
conscious upon the snow stronks
hand darted to his pocket and came
forth with a revolver then a sudden
thought came to him and a sardonic
smile came onto his lips the girl
would not be in camp before the mob
left it was up to him to drag kay in
and turn him over as the man who had
kidnapped the girl the girl would go
direct to her cabin and stronk believed
that he could force jim sanderson to
keep her quiet about stronks part in
the affair stronk knew the story of
astras mother and that was a powerful
weapon to use against the old man the
mob would hang kay in the hysteria
of the moment and stronk would be
free to plan a successful coup of the
gold

  stronk bent over the motionless form
and shook kay roughly

  when did it happen and no re-
sponse coming stronk kicked the help-
less man

  stronk straightened up possibly the
girl had not readied camp as yet if
they had crashed on the way back-but
then stronk reasoned the girl would
rot be with kay had kay been on his
way back they had never reached the
boat that meant that they had crashed
yesterday and the girl had had many
hours to reach the camp probably she
was there now

  as stronk stood debating his next
move he heard voices and whirled to
see the mob coming down the trail
they raised a shout at sight of him and
came forward at a run in that moment
stronk reached a decision to stop
and accuse kay would prove foolhardy
it was not kay they were after it was
him stronk darted away through the
underbrush at a lope and after him came
the mob no one stopped to investigate
the motionless form upon the ground

  it had been two hours after astra
had left that kay recovered conscious-
ness he stared at the canopy of silk
over him with uncomprehending eyes
and then as past events came back to
him he struggled slowly to his feet and
crawled from beneath the parachute in
vain he looked for the girl deciding
at last that she had started off for the
camp kay laughed a little bitterly she
had left him to his own fate then
realizing that it had been she who had
erected the canopy over him he knew
that she had not abandoned him she
had gone for help he told himself he
found the mackinaw her mackinaw
upon which he had been lying and a
queer catch came into his throat she
had sacrificed her coat for him and
in the pockets of the mackinaw there
were bullion cubes he had instructed
the captain to give them to her along
with other supplies kay wished now
that he had told her back there on the
boat that he intended to land her at the
lake from where they had taken off
she believing that he had intended ma-
rooning her had nevertheless sacrificed
her comfort to his welfare

   he ate the bullion cubes as they were 
they were not pleasant to the taste but
they were nourishing when he had
discovered last night that he was out of
gas he estimated that he was but a short
distance from the lake-less than ten
miles as the crow flies if astra had
followed a straight course she would
even now be at the lake or beyond he
searched for her tracks in the snow but


air stories

they had been covered up he struck
off toward the lake swinging to the left
of the low peak that stood in the center
of the mountain pass astra had taken
the right-hand pass but kay did not
know this

    

  kay got slowly to his feet and stared
about him there was a bewildered
expression in his eyes as he searched
for a sign of stronk and then there
came to his ears the sound of shouting
and coming around the cove were a
dozen men who held the struggling
stronk iu their midst

  there is the man who stole the girl
stronk cried and waved toward kay
i was following him

  string em both up someone
shouted and two of the mob broke in
the direction of kay the others fol-
lowed dragging stronk with them

  yes both of them the others took
up the cry theyre both of the same
ilk

  although kay did not fully compre-
hend the situation he did sense the hos-
tility of the mob and he realized that
tfae noosed rope which one ran toward
him with was intended for his neck he
stopped quickly and picked up a club
from the ground with the first im-
pact of that club striking against yield-
ing flesh kay went berserk the light
of a wild fever blazed in his eyes and
his lips drew back in an animal snarl

  two of the mob remained to hold
stronk the rest rushed to the aid of
their companions it was a wild battle
in which the bestial instincts of the men
were unleashed already keyed to a
high pitch by the mob spirit their rea-
son snapped and they became a melee
of kicking slashing humans whose
blows were driven in without regard to
the target in attempting to hit kay
they were slashing at each other but
in the center of the whirlwind kay still
lashed out with his club there was an
angry gash above his eyes and blood
blinded him but still he fought and
cursed

   at last he succumbed to the inevitable
it was beyond human prowess for one
man to successfully battle his way
through such odds a crashing blow
caught him upon the chin and he
dropped to the ground in a thrice he
was caught beneath the shoulders and
his hands were bound behind him

  well take care of him first damn
him one cried come on boys bring
him over here under this limb

  they dragged him beneath the limb
and fastened the noose about his neck
as they threw the rope over the limb
there came a cry from the two guarding
stronk he had broken away and was
racing toward the lake in the mad fear
of his flight stronk did not follow the
shoreline of the lake but plunged into
the icy waters and struck out for the
shore a mile away his pursuers paused
at the bank and as they watched they
saw him suddenly double up and cry
out

  saves us the trouble of hangin
him one of the watchers said hes
took with cramps

  without a backward glance they
strode back to the tree under which kay
now sat

  come on the leader snarled lets
get this over with wheres the girl 
he demanded bending over kay

  but kay did not comprehend the
question his head was wavering dizzily
and he was blinded from the blood that
came from the cut above his eyes

  put a rope around his shoulders to
draw him up with the leader com-
manded

  in addition to the rope about his neck
they tied a second one beneath his arm-
pits the second rope would be used
to draw him up with once drawn high
enough the noosed rope would be made
fast and then the second rope would be
released kay would drop eight feet
before the noosed rope broke his descent
-and his neck

  they hoisted him up and made fast
the noosed rope so that it would break
the fall three feet above the ground
north of the stars



then the two holding the hoisting rope
waited looking toward their leader

   all right let it go he cried

  oh my god stop stop from
the underbrush a small figure ran in a
staggering dash she reached the spot
beneath kay and tottered before she
could right herself kays feet crashed
into her the blow sent her reeling
to the ground where she lay in a
heap but she had broken the fall that
would have snapped kays neck

  the mob stood paralyzed the sud-
den appearance of the girl and her sav-
ing of their victim stunned them at
last one of them sprang toward the
struggling kay and lifted him up while
the noose was slipped from his neck

old jimi sanderson sat beside the
bunk in which astra had lain
sleeping the sleep of complete exhaus-
tion for more than twenty hours when
she was brought to camp it was discov-
ered that in breaking kays death-fall
she had suffered four broken ribs she
opened her eyes slowly and stared at her
father dazedly and then she smiled
wanly

  feelin better honey old jim
asked anxiously

  w-wheres kay she whispered
weakly i-is he-

  kay old jim snorted say  you
aint been sayin nothin else in your
sleep dont you never think to ask
about your old dad but there was a
smile in old jims eyes wait jest a

an he wont be able to see for a few
days looks like him an you must of

  a footfall sounded from outside and
the door opened to admit the doctor
he looked toward astra and smiled as
he saw that she had awakened

  jim he spoke with a sly wink to
the old prospector take that new
crutch i brung you an come with me
no argument he raised his hand
admonitorily

  astra stared after them puzzledly as
her father a crude homemade crutch
supporting him hobbled out after the
doctor and then her eyes widened
through the doorway came another
there was a bandage across his eyes and
he was groping his way cautiously by
placing one hand against the wall

  kay she called to him kay
where are you going

  he paused a moment and jerked his
head about to face the direction of her
voice his lips parted in a smile as he
moved haltingly toward her

is flying dangerous

    the sensational notices given by newspapers to fatalities in naval aviation pro-
duce the impression that flying is still very unsafe

    just how unsafe is it

    the naval bureau of aeronautics has just published figures showing that in
the last ten months there were twenty-six fatalities in naval aviation

    however in those ten months naval aviators flew  hours in the air this
means a fatality every  flying hours

    since the average rate of speed is  miles an hour there is one fatality every
 miles flown this is seventeen and one-half times the distance around the
earth

    is there any means of travel by which you could go round the world seventeen
and a half times without expecting to run into a serious or fatal accident under the
law of averages

by frank richardson pierce

it started as an irish feud a joyous practical joke-but in the end the
decks of a giant dreadnaught ran red

the feud between the moriartys
and the osheas dated from the
battle of manila bay apprentice
seaman moriarty enjoying his first
liberty ashore after many long cramped
months aboard ship had taken on a
quantity of beno and hong kong
scotch due to improper stowage of
cargo moriarty listed heavily to star-
board presently he sighted another
craft steaming toward him alcoholic
fog blurred his vision somewhat but
he hazily recalled the rules of the road
in such an emergency

  when both side lights you see ahead

  port your helm and show your red

  pie executed this maneuver and mut-
tered as he checkcd up on the situation

     green to green or red to red
     perfect safety-go ahead

  lets see the craft bearing down is
ensign michael oshea rah for the


irish under the emboldening influence
of his cargo he hurled the barriers of
regulations and hailed the ensign in the
most chummy manner its a fine
night for a murder sir he observed
and saluted carelessly

  dewey would have returned the salute
and passed on without comment but an
ensign fresh from the academy is
steeped in tradition ensign oshea
frowned besides he knew nothing of
the potency of beno also the weather
was very oppressive in setting the
genial seaman in his proper place he
loosened a flow of language that fairly
withered him

  seaman moriartys alcoholic gesture
was intended as a salute no doubt

  its all right with me brother only
the american navy sticks to its guns
and its the bes dam navy afloat or
ashore it is a fine night for a murder
moriarty wandered away until at
length he beached himself in an aban-

a
flaming wings



dotted hut he awakened the follow-
ing morning in his right mind harried
by an unquenchable thirst thanks to
the lingering powers of beno quanti-
ties of water served merely to create a
beautiful hangover it was during the
reflective period of the hangover that
he recalled an oshea had insulted a
moriarty

  ill square accounts with that fresh
young boot if it takes a lifetime he
vowed

in the years that followed ensign
oshea became captain oshea
and lost none of his youthful ideas of
the fitness of things traditions of the
academy became unbreakable laws
his two-fisted tactics and a voice any
second mate wrould have envied gave
him the justly deserved title roar-
ing mike

  seaman moriarty became gunner
moriarty one of the best gunnery tech-
nicians in the navy many years de-
votion to the work he loved had given
him a practical knowledge of guns tor-
pedoes shells bombs and their intricate
mechanisms that many a commissioned
officer envied the native ingenuity of
many moriartys has made the navy
what it is today

  on a balmy spring afternoon gunner
moriarty viewed the torpedo handling
room in the depths of the dreadnaught
with pardonable pride his critical
gaze wandered from racks holding slim
steel torpedoes to the compressors that
filled the air flasks supplying the torpe-
does with motive power everything
was in perfect order

  business before pleasure he com-
mented aloud and the business is over
with now for pleasure

  the dreadnaught was slumbering in a
quiet harbor a goodly number of her
crew ashore enjoying liberty moriarty
was alone with little prospect of intru-
sion by either officer or man even so
he would be amply warned to reach
the compartment one must descend a
long ladder his immediate superior

lieutenant gridley was aboard but he
was doubtless deep in some problem of
gunnery or aeronautics besides grid-
ley was a mustang officer he had come
up from the ranks his sympathetic
viewpoint as regards enlisted men was
something no academy man could hope
to acquire

  moriarty opened a steel locker and
removed a quart bottle containing fluid
of pinkish hue the same ingenuity
that had served his country so well for
nearly three decades was now to be ap-
plied to a strictly personal problem
the bottle contained grain alcohol re-
quired on shipboard for mechanical
purposes to insure its application to
mechanical rather than social use a
thoughtful government had diluted it
with potassium permanganate a most
effective deterrent shock-proof stom-
achs that accepted white mule moon-
shine or weird concoctions of the home
distiller in suffering silence broke forth
in red revolution when introduced to
pink lady

  moriarty connected an electric per-
colator to a convenient socket and
poured a portion of the pink lady into
a receptacle intended originally for or-
thodox coffee a small glass was wired
into position just above the liquid and
above the glass he suspended a smooth
glass bowl filled with ice the vapor
from the boiling fluid encountered the
cold bowl condensed and trickled into
the glass-good grain alcohol fit for any
man with an iron constitution mo-
riartys constitution ran heavily to
iron

  the process was somewhat slow and
moriarty filled in the time humming
an appealing little ditty of the puget
sound country

       four and twenty yankees
       feeling mighty dry

       motored to vancouver
       for a shot of rye

       when the rye was open
       the yanks began to sing
       to the devil with volstead
       god save the king

  he cooled the glass with ice then


air stories

downed the contents with an apprecia-
tive exclamation presently the atmos-
phere in the handling room became
warm and genial life for the sole occu-
pant took on a rosy hue usually re-
served and thoughtful he became loqua-
cious the immediate outlook was
viewed charitably

  got to give credit where credit is
due he announced thickly this is
the best dam navy in the world this
was followed by a period of grave re-
flection yes sir im here to tell yuh
my ship is the best dam ship in the
best dam navy in the world he
brought the palms of his hands together
with a resounding crack of conviction
my division is the best dam division
of the best dam ship of the best
dam   

  he stopped suddenly as a pair of feet
descended the ladder he blinked a
moment and recognized the shoes his
voiced lifted musically

  lieutenant gridley came up through
the hawse pipe and theres tar in
his hair hes the best dam gunry
officer of the best dam ship in
the  

  the descending feet paused at this
point and rapidly ascended that was
one of the many fine qualities about
gridley he made due allowance for
the weakness and falls from grace
of efficient men if not too frequent
he managed to miss seeing a lot he
was in duty bound to report if he
saw

  moriarty again glanced approvingly
about the handling room his gaze
stopped at the loud speaker by speak-
ing in a normal tone his voice would
boom forth in every compartment in the
ship his expression changed slowly
from geniality to firm resolution he
stepped to the instrument squared off
and announced

  its a fine afternoon for a murder
sir

  like a voice from the mysterious be-
yond the words beat against lieutenant
gridleys ear drums he left the com-

partment hurriedly and peered down
upon the culprit

  pipe down moriarty he ordered
sharply the captain might have
heard you

  that was my intention sir this
being a private affair between the mo-
riartys and the osheas datin back to
the shindy at manila bay

  moriarty stood stiffly at attention
when gridley stepped from the ladder
though it was apparent a warm friend-
ship existed many an experiment in
gunnery improvement devices had been
worked out with gridleys inventiveness
and moriartys practical experience

  i hope    gridley began the
skippers voice on the loud speaker in-
terrupted authoritatively

  gunner moriarty report to the cap-
tain immediately

  hot coffee cold water and fright
combined could not have sobered mo-
riarty as quickly he hopped to obey
the wardroom country seemed depress-
ingly gloomy as he entered the sacred
precincts he progressed by a series of
mental thrusts and a prayer on his lips
the prayer wras answered respite
came unconsciously he muttered
pink lady

  but a different sort of a lady was
kathleen oshea she went in for deli-
cate shades and tints of pink as exqui-
site as herself in addition to her
mothers vivid beauty she had more than
a dash of old roaring mikes fire and
spirit in her makeup the wills of
father and daughter clashed on occa-
sion ultra-feminine she might be in
appearance yet she could do a hundred
yards in a swimming tank close to the
record and had once swum golden gate
in navy circles she proved to be a dis-
turbing element ensigns hovered in
the distance lieutenants made romantic
love and captains regretted the passing
of time

  it might be guessed miss kathleen
was difficult to manage unless she
wished to be managed she was
roaring michael oshea could manage
flaming wings



a dreadnaught and a thousand men or
a battleship division but he had tough
sledding with either his wife or daugh-
ter

  gunner moriarty steamed by the skip-
pers door at full speed and permitted
miss kathleen to enter there was no
ceremony she merely thrust her head
through the opening and said hello
old dear

  old dear grunted

  be seated kathleen he rumbled
i wish to have a serious talk with
you

   fire when ready gridley  she
lightly invited

  its concerning that damned mus-
tang kathleen that i sent for you

  into the word mustang the skipper
put all the aversion an academy man of
the old school has for the officer who
comes from the ranks or the hawse
pipe there was a fine blending of
contempt indignation and rage in his
tone except for a fleeting flash of
fire in her eyes the daughter seemed
un ruffled

  thems harsli words dad she said
sweetly

  roarin mike hasnt got the range at
all mused moriarty but shes putting
him in a frame of mind thatll make it
tough for me or kill his spirit for the
time being

  very harsh words dad the girl
repeated

  gridlevs worse than a mustang he
had his chance in the academy but was
kicked out

  i believe the academic diagnosis of
the malady was ineptitude she replied
but i am told the real reason was be-
cause the fires of inventive genius con-
sumed hcr-irs intended for study how-
ever he came into the wardroom
through the hawse pipe thanks to the
war i believe he did a number of
thrilling things with a seaplane and an-
nexed a medal or two to wear along
with his cocked hat on formal occa-
sions

  the skipper made a brave effort to

be calm and succeeded temporarily

  kathleen be serious this is a se-
rious matter yet you seem utterly
shameless dont you realize this ser-
vice has traditions  why do you flaunt
yourself brazenly in public with the
damned cuss when any number of
academy men are standing by await-
ing the word to come alongside
really dad much as i dislike to
ruffle your feelings the traditions of
service are nothing in my young life
where that big boy is concerned

  hells delight groaned the skip-
per are you engaged

  no such luck he hasnt asked
me she managed to say it without
blushing thanks to pent-up rage

  dam his impudence hes the only
officer footloose and in his right mind
that hasnt why hasnt he he had
always known gridley was a dreaming
ass this proved it

  why hasnt he she repeated
how should i know ive done my
best with the few charms nature has
given me plus a moonlight night waving
palms and soft music but he wont give
me a tumble i think perhaps i shall
have to throw myself at him

  kathleen roaring mike stood up
and paced the room dont make
light of this affair

  im not far be it from such it
is a tragedy when a girl throws her
heart at a mans feet and he cant even
see it

  ive tried to approach this affair
with my usual diplomacy at this
point kathleen repressed a giggle
now i shall assert my authority you
can go to the dance with him tonight
as you planned but that ends it hes
through for all time make it plain to
him emphatic if he still persists
then who knows but hell be ordered to
guam or some jungle post for extended
duty 

  she caught the threat and the femi-
nine counterpart of old roaring mikes
jaw hardened then relaxed in a soft
smile something told the skipper this


air stories

last salvo was a misfire following regu-
lations he elevated his guns and waited
the prescribed time before pulling the

charge

  if you werent such a lovable old
bluff she said softly i should be
angry at the bare suggestion of such un-
fair tactics as a transfer but  

she again smiled as she fired a salvo of
her own every projectile of which found
its mark lieutenant gridley has re-
signed from the navy

  resigned eh boys made it too hot
for him the skipper rubbed his
hands in satisfaction

  quite the contrary i rather think
the feeling toward mustang officers has
died down since the war lawrence
gridley resigned because rules and regu-
lations cramp his style he cant argue
with superior officers very well so he
is returning to the attack as a civilian
when he has proved to certain stubborn
staff and line officers that it is possible
to bomb a battleship out of the water
with his new type of plane and gear and
his rather interesting system of range
finding i think he will then return to
the service

  he mentioned certain stubborn offi-
cers did he hah im one of em i
told him hed better make good as a
lieutenant before tackling problems a
staff of veterans is working on

  he has spent a considerable part of
his private fortune in this work there
are two people who have faith in him
and the most important one is lieuten-
ant gridley recognition is due him
and he is clever enough to force it

  hmmm just let him tread on my
toes with his recognition forcing and see
what happens ive never been beaten
yet and i dont propose to spoil a life-
time record by yielding to a damned
mustang with this defi the skipper
looked for a loophole of escape and
found it come here and kiss your old
dad and stop arguing with me there
thats better now shove off cant
you see im busy

  because she knew this dad of hers

kathleen oshea obeyed she knew
there would be no relenting where grid-
ley and his ideas were concerned each
belonged to a school of clashing military
thought the one believing the battleship
was doomed the other regarding planes
as merely valuable aids

  roaring mike oshea was silent for
several moments after his daughters
departure then becoming conscious
of an alien presence he glanced up

  what the devil do you want
moriarty 

  you passed the word for me sir
moriarty awaited the deluge

  huh the devil that girl knocked
it out of my head get out

  moriarty did not wait for a second
order he silently faded away

  he found lieutenant gridley in
dungarees working on a range-finding
device that would permit a man two
miles in the air to direct the fire
of a battleship at a target below the
horizon

  what happened queried the lieu-
tenant with keen interest youve
been gone long enough

  miss oshea slipped in ahead of
me she was the target for the old
mans guns but he didnt have the
range she left him a shattered smoul-
dering bulk he treated me almost de-
cently and forgot what he wanted me
for into moriartys eyes crept an
expression of reproach youve re-
signed 

  yes it takes effect tomorrow i
thought i told you dont look so glum
about it ive got it figured out you
are due to retire a month hence very
well retire and come work for me
even after i have proved a number of
things there will beplenty of work for
you but youve got to lay off the
hooch moriarty

  thats fine sir i swore off
  when 

  about five minutes ago when
roarin mike was trying to recall what
he wanted me for terrible sensa-
tion 
flaming wings



  swearing off

  no wondering if the old boy was a
mind reader im through for good
ive said it a couple of hundred times
in my life but this time goes no more
pink lady unless    well i might
want to celebrate some big day but itll
have to be a bigger day than the fourth
of july or new years

  moriarty as usual was very serious
all men are serious about swearing off
it is a serious thing at the time

the osheas had leased a comfort-
able home during the period of the
ships overhaul at the navy yard
lieutenant gridley in formal dress
medals and all stepped from his car
and was duly announced he won-
dered if the old skipper would be at
home but he did not care much

  the skipper was

  come in he ordered and sit
down kathleen will be ready in fif-
teen minutes

  he regarded gridley critically and
grudgingly admitted he was handsome
and looked like an academy man roar-
ing mike tapped an article he had been
reading in a navy publication

  youre the author of this damned
libel he shouted

   aircraft vs seacraft  read grid-
ley my honest opinion sir

  how the devil can the navy de-
partment get a decent appropriation
from congress for the improvement of
yards the elevation of guns to a par
with those of foreign fleets when stuff
like this comes out one would think
the battleship was ready for the junk
heap its piffle and bunk and you
know itl

  i  gridley began

  you can do nothing interrupted
roaring mike tapping his contentions
into the younger mans knee granted
bombers destroyed the battleship vir-
ginia and new jersey neither was
manned nor attempted a defense the
allies bombed the zeebrugge flood gate
for four years and never hit it while

the germans bombed the flood gate at
dunkirk with no better success a ger-
man battle-cruiser was bombed a thou-
sand times when she was aground hit
sixteen times then shoved off for the
black sea

  which gets us down to the matter
of efficient devices in range-finding
replied gridley calmly enough it is
no idle boast when i say i can take my
light bomber out any time and give your
ship a fine old pelting i can even give
you advance warning and do it ill go
further you can send your airplafies
up and if they can outmaneuver me ill
call it a day and not drop a bomb
huh is that a challenge there
was plenty of fight in old roaring
mikes attitude now he was leaning
forward his gray mustache seemed to
bristle his teeth set is it a chal-
lenge 

  most assuredly if you wish to take
it as such

 hah then i accept do your
damnedest and let me tell you ill have
several newspaper men aboard when we
sail to join the fleet i propose to settle
this once and for all

  and if you lose

  i wont lose youll have to step
like hell to convince me nothing in
the way of a perfunctory demonstration
goes youve got to drive your facts
home and make em stick if you do all
that ill back water yes by the eter-
nal ill 

  he glanced toward kathleen oshea
who stood in the doorway waiting then
back to gridley a flash of understand-
ing seemed to pass between them

  yes said the skipper if you do
all you claim youre entitled to anything
in the world

  long after the sound of gridleys
motor had died roaring mike puffed
angrily at his pipe presently he
chuckled

  ill get two of the best newspaper
men i know let em see what happens
with their own eyes and theyll set that
chump in his place one thing kath-

leen cant stand is a person who makes
himself ridiculous

red tape upset plans as it fre-
quently does and moriarty did not
quit the dreadnaught until a day pre-
vious to sailing two tight-lipped
keenly observing individuals had taken
quarters aboard moriarty recognized
them as newspaper writers who would
have made fine umpires in all they did
they called the play as they saw it re-
gardless of who might be hit by chips
they scattered

  moriarty found the hangar deserted
but gridleys seaplane was in readiness
for the test the gunner was moved
to boundless admiration as he inspected
the laboratory everything had the
stamp of the navy about it

  in the plane itself he found dual con-
trols and the most compact range finder
he had ever seen the service had
nothing to equal it as yet mirrors and
lenses combined to reflect what lay be-
low the scene appeared on a square
of ground glass there were cranks to
turn and indicators that changed num-
bers with every movement altitude
drift speed of plane speed of target
were all taken care of gridley had
gone straight to the heart of things and
devised instruments comprehensive to
even an untrained mind the delicate
combination of trained operators and
complicated instruments had been elimi-
nated

  hes got to win moriarty mut-
tered those newspaper boys have
got to be impressed with whats taking
place over their heads now    if i
hadnt taken the pledge id give my
mind a bit of stimulant and thered be
things doing tomorrow a mind sure
sparks when encouraged a bit then
theres the grudge of the moriartys
against the osheas if i was a bit
clever id tie the two together

  he indulged in a period of reflection
five minutes later it dawned upon him
this was one of the greatest days of
his life retirement from the service

with an honorable record of duties well
performed the thought was so pleas-
ant he unconsciously hummed a tune

       four and twenty yankees

        feeling mighty dry

        motored to vancouver   

  this gave him an idea navy habits
are difficult to shake hence gridley must
liave a bit of grain alcohol for mechani-
cal purposes the search was lengthy
and thorough gridley did have grain
alcohol for mechanical purposes inci-
dentally it had been diluted as a matter
of course

  moriarty hesitated briefly very
briefly then searched the gridley
apartment close at hand he returned
with a percolator glass bowl and
cracked ice some minutes later he
turned on the switch and awaited re-
sults the result was held up for in-
spection

  well as the governor of north
carolina said to the governor of south
carolina    ahh heres another
to the conclusion of long and honorable
service in the best dam navy in the
world ahh

  a period of reflection then

  and still another to all officers that
come up through the hawse pipe may
they never get the tar out of their hair
ahh boy youre going strong to-
night

  he glanced about the hangar until he
caught sight of the telephone directory
this gave him a brilliant idea failing
to find the number he called informa-
tion and was rewarded in due time with
a gruff hello

  gunner moriarty u s n re-
tired sends his compliments to capn
michael oshea u s n unretired
an reminds him ts a fine night for a
murder

  the click of the receiver on the other
end of the line nearly took moriartys
head off

  true to his prediction the moriarty
mind commenced to spark under encour-
agement with dignity born of the
flaming wings

i

occasion lie inspected the practice bombs
in the planes magazine they were
designed to hit but not harm moriarty
shook his head

  no good itll take moren that to
dent roarin mikes hide its toughern
the skin of a conning tower no sense
in a man like gridley awaiting to be re-
warded in heaven im in favor of
making the decks run red yep red ill
incorp    incorp    ill corporate
ideas of my own

  in the gray of dawn he refilled the
planes magazine with bombs of his own
choosing then blissfully fell asleep
where gridley found him a half-hour
later gridley read the signs correctly
and dismissed the incident with a crisp
might have known hed celebrate
hell be all right in the morning

stirred into wakefulness mori-
arty licked dry- lips with a tongue
suggestive of a wad of cotton and looked
about

  howd i get here he queried
climbed there i suppose replied
gridley found you asleep in the
plane last night figured the way you
felt youd sleep as well there as any-
where were ready to shove oft as
soon as we eat a bite

  ill be ready as soon as i drink a
gallon of water and spill another gallon
over my head

  swearing cheerfully moriarty loos-
ened cramped joints and adjusted his
clothing the percolator reminded him
in part of the nights doingsk but only in
part the highest lights did not intrude
just then

  the hangar was located on a quiet
lake one of thousands along the sea-
coast from which a seaplane might be
launched in smooth water and return to
in safety after a raid moriarty was
cold even when garbed for the flight
somewhat hazily he recalled tucking a
bottle into his overcoat pocket the pre-
vious night he investigated and pres-
ently drained a half-filled pint flask
hidden fires in his being kindled he

felt warmer and cracked the palms of
his hands together

  lets go he shouted the enemy
awaits

  gridley eyed him with a grin

  might have known you had an eye
opener cached away oh well climb
in but dont fool with the controls until
i pass the word

  the plane taxied down the mirroring
waters of the lake cleared circled
skimmed the tree tops and shot straight
seaward within a few minutes a
range of mountains came over the hori-
zon and vanished beneath their wings
as if they remained moveless in midair
while the world turned with velvet
smoothness below

  it was dark in the valley when the
sun caught their wings by the time
the light line had crept from crested
peak to valley floor the sea was dead
ahead from their elevation it seemed
placid except where land and water
met-a line of seething surf smother-
ing irregular like a swans-down boa
carelessly flung aside

  the section directly below moved in
natural colors across the ground glass
field of the range finder as if fed in at
one edge and spilled out the other here
and there surf-fringed rocks stood
bleakly alone once a flock of startled
ducks dangerously close to the plane
yet indicated on the field by tiny black
dots in v-formation came and van-
ished

  the battleship had evidently entered
fully into the spirit of the game no
tell-tale wisp of smoke drifted above the
horizon to betray her position when
at last gridley located her she was
steaming full speed southward

  a reckless smile flashed across his
face a thrill akin to that he had
known in the north sea swept through
him

  the world below- turned rapidly and
brought the great ship nearer and
nearer like the bleak rocks she was
ringed with white foam spreading
fanlike from her clipper bow seethed


air stories

along her beams and spread astern

  gridley was too high for them to spot
him except by sheer accident he in-
tended to remain so until the moment
of attack forward neatly toggled
swung two bombs filled with chemicals
similar to those used in life buoy
markers

  contact with water started both a
flare and smoke cloud the plane
swooped down a moment later two
white smudges marked the spot where
the bombs had struck he checked up
on his range in a series of swift move-
ments the battleship blurred then
focused sharply on the ground glass
field

  let em go gridley shouted mo-
riarty over the telephone in his tone
was repressed excitement and utter
elation

my string has gone well check
up and cut yours loose gridley replied

the dreadnaughts quarterdeck had
once been a joy to captain osheas
eyes it was spotless and roomy then
the madness of planes came and yard
workmen built a catapult down the cen-
ter a device that profaned the gaze of
one who loved quarterdeck traditions
it was an outrage a crime and an abom-
ination but an order and that settled
it like birds poised for flight two
planes rested on either side

  the drone of gridleys plane as it
dropped from the blue sent a tingle of
excitement through the battleship aft
the skipper peered through binoculars
with skeptical eyes he mistook the
chemical bombs for misses and an
exclamation of satisfaction escaped
him

  no one was prepared for what took
place when the plane swept back to the
attack officers and men alike were
dumfounded then training told and a
number of things took place swiftly
two men rushed forward and picked
up a seaman knocked to the deck by a
descending missile his head and
shoulders were a gory mass

  the officer of the deck swore fu-
riously from the ships funnel came
the dense black plumes of the smoke
screen the dreadnaught veered from
its course in an effort to get out of
range

  forward a bosuns mate lay groaning
his head and white hat stained deeply
at the skippers elbow his messenger
suddenly crumpled the skipper him-
self was stricken by the same blast from
the blue

  a newspaper man with rare presence
of mind dove headlong for a turret in
one second he had seen enough to spread
through eight columns but as dead men
tell no tales he wanted to live to relate
his smashing story

  high above the plane banked and re-
turned for the final attack the radio-
phone brought a frantic message to
gridleys ears

  for gods sake gridley cease
firing

  they came into range at that moment
and moriarty released the contents of
the second magazine a brief interval
and they had cleared the smoke screen
again the voice

  gridley are you mad

  an aa gun suddenly let go and a
shell burst near enough to rock them
this was the real thing gridley
tensed with excitement and utter joy
of course they wouldnt hit him but
they intended to give him some real
action perhaps frighten him into de-
scending alongside to be laughed at
then hauled aboard

  a shift in the breeze cleared the bat-
tleships stern one plane had been shot
from the catapult the second was pre-
paring to follow gridley banked and
watched the result the plane left the
ship perfectly and winged its way
swiftly aloft 

  that puts a crust on the whole
thing said moriarty we can show
em the getaway now

  gridley fled the other plane in hot
pursuit twenty miles down the coast
he alighted in a protected cove and
flaming wings

taxied to the beach within two min-
utes the pursuing plane came alongside
when the pilot stepped ashore he car-
ried a service pistol in his hand on his
face was written lingering amazement
and present determination here was a
young man who meant business

  he covered the pair without hesita-
tion

  are you crazy gridley he cried
watching them narrowly youve con-
vinced the world of your ability to hit a
ship but man oh man our decks ran
red with brave american blood  from
bow to stem they died like flies they
were carrying the captain below when
i left

  what do you mean stuart grid-
ley realized the other was in deadly ear-
nest in some way his experiment had
resulted in horrible tragedy

  what do i mean  man alive you
bombed us with those infernal bombs
of yours and scored hit after hit the
ship is a shambles he came closer
you are under arrest of course



  gridley ignored the pilot and his pis-
tol he recalled the empty bottles of
pink lady the damning percolator and
  moriarty he whirled on his as-
sistant furiously

  moriarty did you tamper with my
bombs 

  moriarty seemed suddenly to realize
that he had and inwardly he thanked
god for the american sense of
humor

  aye-aye sir now that you mention
it i did i wanted you to score hits
theyd remember hits the higher ups
couldnt pigeonhole when reported and
i loaded the magazines with the biggest
bombs i could get of their kind

 go on man what were the
both officers looked at moriarty with
drawn faces

  mr stuart will you present the
moriarty compliments to the osheas
on your return to the ship and just
mention this was a fine day for a mur-
der the bombs were very red over-
ripe tomatoes

college flyers on the job

   the harvard flying club has got its ship in the air and the travel air
is now flying daily the story of the club is an interesting one

   on march   rodney jackson organized a group of students in
harvard under the title of the harvard flying club at that time
twenty-five men were members of the club and all but nine have been gradu-
ated up to the present time much amusement was derived by some in-
dividuals at that time because of the fact that the flying club had no means
of flying last fall billings came to the rescue and offered the boys a travel
air that had been used considerably at a reduced price fred ames loaned
the money to purchase the plane the ship was taken down and housed in
gordon mckay laboratory through the courtesy of prof lionel s marks and
the engineering school in february it was transferred to a garage and
murray n fairbanks began to overhaul it crocker snow gave the ship
ten coats of duco and w n bump re-upholstered the cockpits frank
sproul did his part by grinding the valves on march th sproul and marks
towed the plane to the airport and eddie otoole rigged her billings
flight-tested the ship and pronounced it o k

   ten hours of solo time are necessary in order to be elected to the flight
committee

  - a heavy hand fell on peter

  crisps shoulder a feeling of
panic surged through his slender body
his muscles cringed he poised on his
toes as if for flight

  then he steadied his hands clamped
themselves into fists his shoulders stif-
fened his teeth came together with a
snap as he whirled on his heels to face
the man behind him

  cold grey steel eyes stabbed into his
he got an impression of a thin-lipped
mouth and an iron jaw

  youve got nothing on me he mut-
tered through dry lips

  the tnan dropped his hand from
peters shoulder and he smiled no

peter crisp disgraced birdman
calls on his faltering manhood for
a last grim clash with winged
mystery

ve got nothing on you but i may
have something for you

you know-who i am peter stam-
mered gazing with puzzled frown into
the cold eyes still probing into his

dont i though the man snapped
youre peter crisp one-time flying ace
of the a e f after the war you came
here to los angeles as an instructor at
a civilian flying school then you did
stunts for the world famous people
and then-one afternoon you took the
beautiful gilda moon up in your plane
-and crashed

a look of pain flashed over peters
face fear and hunger were written
there not the hunger of the belly kind
-although that too was troubling peter
the sky horse



right now-but the spiritual hunger of
the grounded airman and bitter disap-
pointment he recalled that terrible
afternoon when his ship had come spin-
ning down out of control to crash in a
roar of splintered wings before the very
eyes of the motion-picture directors
peter had aged ten years that single
afternoon something of his old boyish
eagerness had gone from him then his
brown eyes had taken on a look of hard-
ness his mouth had frozen in a cynical
smile the old laughing reckless dare-
devil birdman of the war and of civilian
flying days had given place to a sober
reflective disappointed man

  they said i was drunk he stated
soberly that i had endangered their
most famous movie star but she froze
to the controls shed been begging me
to let her fly the ship-i was a fool i
guess to let her try

  exactly and now youre done as
far as flying here on the coast is con-
cerned

  i-i suppose so

  peters shoulders slumped and he
turned to stare into the brightly lighted
window of the restaurant before which
they were standing the mans eyes
followed peters longing gaze which
was directed at the fragrant food dis-
plays he smiled grimly to himself

  broke blacklisted down and out
he whispered softly

  i may be broke peter turned
quickly but im a damned long way
from being down and out

  thats all right soothed the
stranger ive got a proposition to
offer that may interest you you like
flying dont you 

  an expression of longing appeared
for a second on peters face i live
for it

  all right said the stranger youre
the man i want ive got a little fly-
ing job down over the border that will
pay a top salary if youll come with
me well go somewhere and talk it
over

  just a minute peters eyes hard-

ened ive had offers like that before
what is it dope-or booze i might as
well save you trouble by telling you
right now that i dont go in for that
kind of stuff as you mentioned a mo-
ment ago i was an ace during the war
ive served uncle sam fought for him
would have died for him and im not
interested in any of your cheap smug-
gling schemes now i went overseas
with the flag carried it into foreign ter-
ritory and i know what it means if
youre looking for someone to pilot your
damned outlaw planes across the border
you can just drift on down the street
im not interested

  the strangers smile spread into a
grin he thrust one hand into his pocket
and exhibited something that flashed
golden in the light from the restaurant
window holding it cupped in his palm
he extended it for peter to see

  dont get excited boy he said in a
friendly voice im working for uncle
sam too but ive got to be mighty
quiet about it theres folks right here
in california thatd be interested to
know that jim donovan had come all the
way out from washington and that hes
planning on making a little flying trip
down over the border

  peter crisp extended his hand mr
donovan im glad to know you now
we can talk business what do you want
me to do

  come inside and lets eat donovan
suggested i can tell by the looks of
you that a good steak under your belt
wouldnt do you any harm

  this is a ticklish kind of job the
federal man went on when they were
seated in the restaurant and the waitress
had gone to fill their order i cant tell
you very much about it because i dont
know myself but something mighty
queer is going on along the border it
aint dope and it aint booze as far as
we can figure out we dont know what
it is planes have been seen there big
planes painted black and there are
smaller fighting planes too american
army flyers have reported being fired on


air stories

several times lately it seems like there
was a kind of battle going on down there
-for the supremacy of the air

  peter took a deep breath his young
face glowed with eagerness

  fighting planes convoying a bomber
he mused must be something big
ive heard of smuggling before but
never of anything on such a large scale
the older man shook his head it
beats me he admitted yve dont get
this at all we know about where they
cross the border but we dont know
where their landing fields on either side
are located thats our mission-as
youd call it in the army we dont want
to go looking for a fight we want to
locate those flying fields after that we
can use the army and the marines to mop
up with if we want to of course he
added quickly seeing the look of disap-
pointment on peters face if we run
into anybody that acts rough weve got
to be ready to scrap with them well
be armed all right you make arrange-
ments to buy a plane ill see that it is
equipped with machine guns and all that
i can get just about what i want from
the army air stations we wont be
exactly defenseless when we go over the
bad lands son

  sounds good to me peter grinned
eyeing the great platter of steak which
the girl put down before him i havent
had such a chance since we went up to
battle the old boche in the meuse-
argonne scrap

  fall to on that steak grunted dono-
van well talk about this some more
after a while

four days later in the mists of early
morning a two-seater army jenny
stood before the hangar doors of the air-
line aircraft corporation ready to take
off her prop hummed slowly as the
mechanics warmed up the engine from
her forward cockpit protruded the blunt
nose of a machine gun another cov-
ered with canvas nestled on its mount-
ings before the pilots seat

  two men in flying coveralls their

heads grotesque in leather helmets stood
nearby idly smoking cigarettes

  head straight for the flying field at
san diego first donovan instructed
well fuel there take on supplies and
ammunition then make for the border

  right agreed peter god it feels
good to be around ships again

  his eyes were sparkling with a new
light his shoulders were thrown back
with a new confidence he seemed alert
eager youthful-no longer the cringing
individual jim donovan had picked up
in front of the restaurant a few short
days before the sight of a ship and
the feel of the controls always did that
for peter and this was his chance to
come back to establish himself in the
eyes of the world again

  as a boy peter had made toy models
of airplanes-and flown them success-
fully the war had given him his chance
to become a flyer it was in his blood
now no other profession or occupation
would ever interest him and that one
fatal slip had almost brought about his
ruin

  he grinned ruefully as he remem-
bered the biting words of the motion-
picture director well all that was
ancient history he was going over the
border with jim donovan to find-
what he didnt know and he didnt
care to be in the air again-with the
stick in his hands and feel the lurch and
roll of the plane under him that was
enough

  ready to go sir announced one of
the mechanics

  peter crisp and jim donovan climbed
into their seats and strapped down the
safety belts peter jazzed the motor and
felt it smooth and sweet under his
throttle he nodded and the mechanics
pulled the chocks from the front wheels
peter taxied the plane out into the field
headed her into the wind and gave her
the gun she sailed evenly over the
smooth grass

  he felt her tail lift and pulled back
on the joy-stick the jenny bounded
into the air like a bird released from a
the sky horse



cage and went roaring away into the
air-headed south

  los angeles fell away behind them as
they climbed in a long straight slope
into the clouds the sea appeared on
their right and a great steamer plowing
out to hawaii looked like a childs toy
boat below them

  look at that peter pointed over-
head

  far up in the heavens hovered a tiny
plane it flew in circles searching the
air below then as if it had sighted
them it straightened out and went into
a dive peter heard the engine roar as
it came charging down with throttle
open

  donovan motioned frantically a sig-
nal that peter could not understand

  the fabric on the right wing of the
jenny ruffled as if it were being ripped
with tiny knives something tugged at
the control bar under peters feet he
felt the ship lurch and slide off to one
side

  he knew what was happening he
had experienced things like this before
-over the argonne a machine gun
was being fired through the propeller of
that advancing ship they were using
no tracer bullets the roar of the engine
drowned all sound

  peter jerked back on his stick and
gave the plane the gun she zoomed
beautifully coming over on her back and
sliding off into a spin as he turned
peter caught a flashing glimpse of a
black menacing plane two hooded
hawk-like heads peering up at him from
the fuselage

  wires screaming wings complaining
engine roaring peters ship rushed for
earth in a headlong spin that looked like
certain death he was playing an old
trick learned during the war the plane
fell it spun dizzily down to earth the
enemy went sailing away thinking that
it had been shot down

  a thousand feet from the brown earth
below peter dragged back on the stick
damped down on the rudder-bar and
brought ship shuddering and howling

from every strut and wire out of the
spin and flattened her out looking back
over his shoulder he saw the white
strained face of jim donovan he
nodded and grinned reassuringly to his
companion all that was possible because
of the roar of the motor then banked
away in a long glide toward san diego

  when the ship settled like a bird on
the flying field it was a stiff and frown-
ing federal agent who climbed out of
his seat he mopped his face with a
red bandanna and scowled across at his
pilot

  the dirty sneakin bums he rum-
bled grimly can you beat that  we
thought we were putting one over on
them and they knew about us all the
time from now on we fly with both
guns oiled and loaded let them try
that stunt again if they want to well
be ready for em

  looks like a fight all right peter
agreed examining the damaged fabric
of his wing a little to the left and
wed have ended our trip almost before
we got going

  we start in the morning said don-
ovan grimly these people here will
fix you up with whatever you need to-
morrow we go over the line and see
what we can find they must be mighty
anxious down there about us ill tell
you theres something big going on or
they wouldnt go to all that trouble to
get us before we even cross the border

next morning they began the last
lap of the journey both machine
guns were loaded and peter and dono-
van each carried a heavy automatic
pistol there were supplies for two
weeks stored in the fuselage of the ship
and the tanks carried enough gasoline
and oil for ten hours in the air

  no use trying for any particular
spot said donovan just before they
took off we dont know where to
head for just go over the border and
cruise around and well see what we
can see

  it was a fine clear morning with a


air stories

light mist still clinging close to earth

   an ideal flying day peter told him-
self visibility very high good air
and a whole lonesome sky to move in

  as he listened to the sweet roar of
the motor the hum of the wires the
steady reliable surge of the ship as she
rode the air he felt for the first time in
months that he was really living again

  he looked down and realized that
they were flying over lower california
the brown earth the blue haze of the
mountains in the distance the gray
stretches of desert spread out below
him like a map of some desolate sun-
scorched wasteland somewhere down
below them was a landing field
hangars mechanics flyers and several
planes at least the big bomber and the
convoy ships that the army flyers had
reported perhaps more

  he scanned the country with search-
ing eyes but only brown plain and
rugged mountain stretched away into
the distance

  peter glanced at his passenger for
some sign that would tell him where to
go donovan was peering ahead along
the fringe of white puff ball clouds
which hung like an awning from the
sky overhead following his direction
peter saw a great black bird of the air
winging her solitary way south it
was a plane of enormous size broad of
wing and heavy of body as he
watched she dipped and slid into a long
dive

  donovan motioned excitedly follow
that plane that was the idea go after
that big soaring bird and bring it to
earth

  peter opened wide the throttle and
shot his bus through the air at full
speed he reached for his gun and
fired a clip to warn her then he
settled down to the chase

  the big black ship still a speck in
the distance hovered lower and lower
over the parched desert peter could
see her steady descent and wondered
where she could be headed for at the

speed he was traveling he would soon
overtake her perhaps there would be
another fight this time with his gun in

action

  the big black ship settled slowly over
a rise in the ground and disappeared

  landed i peter hissed through his
teeth now weve got her

  it was only a matter of seconds until
the jenny roared over the low hill
where the leading ship had disappeared
below stretched a broad brown desert
-empty

  peter rubbed his eyes and stared
again there was nothing there the
black ship had disappeared as com-
pletely as if the earth had opened and
swallowed it

  jim donovan turned and pointed
down indicating that they were to de-
scend at once peter put the plane
into a slow glide and slid toward the
plain he flattened out felt the tail
skid touch and cut the motor the
ship bounced along for a hundred yards
and stopped

  look at those tracks he pointed
excitedly to the dust of the field two
broad marks showed where the other
ship had taxied theres something
damn strange about this business i
donovan leaped to the ground and
peered at the plane tracks he pulled
his gun from its holster and examined
it carefully

  come on son heres where we
find out about this well follow the
tracks until we get to the plane

  right agreed peter swinging
himself to the ground cant hide a
big ship like that in a bush must be
around here somewhere

  the two men trudged side by side
across the dusty field the ground rose
just ahead in a low hill then dipped
away to the blue horizon peter felt as
if he were walking in a nightmare
that big black ship had to be some-
where it had not gone up again he
was sure of that and yet there on the
ground before him were the twin tracks
the sky horse



with the ragged mark where the tail
skid had cut into the hard alkali which
showed that it had landed here

  a rifle cracked and a bullet seared a
red hot furrow across peters shoulder
under his leather coat again the gun
barked in the still desert air he saw
jim donovan drop to the ground reach-
ing for his heavy automatic as he fell

  down peter down donovan
hissed

  from the ground the flyer gazed
anxiously about him for the source of
the shot the plain lay deserted and
barren before his eyes

  where the hell are they growled
donovan gun in hand if there wasnt
two of us here id say id gone plumb
crazy i

  again the rifle barked and the bullet
threw dust not five feet from donovans
head

 i see em yelled peter over by
that rock a kind of a door opened in
the ground and the rifle barrel came
through it

  door grunted donovan shifting
his position until his gun trained on the
rock where the hell is any door out
here now i know one of us is nuts

  i get it now peter cried its an
old german trick underground
hangars theyve dug under that hill
and keep the planes there weve
stumbled on the base of the gang sure
as hell they have doors painted like
rocks and covered with earth

  by god i believe youre right
donovan peered cautiously ahead at the
hill at first it appeared to be like any
other rolling hummock of dirt and
stone then as his eyes adjusted them-
selves to the dancing heat waves he saw
that half the hill was not solid at all but
composed of two wide canvas doors
painted in exact copy of the surround-
ing desert he could see tracks going
up to these doors and ending suddenly
against their base

  lets get out of here he called to
peter can you run weve got
what we want now no use staying and

letting that gang come out after us
and our plane wed better get to it
and get into the air before they start
after us

  ill try peter gritted his teeth
but id like a crack at the bird who
plugged me through the shoulder first

  no time for that warned donovan
lets get goin while weve got the
chance come on run for it

  peter swayed dizzily on his feet his
wound was not serious but it was pain-
ful and blood matted his shirt under the
flying coat he set out at a lumbering
gait for the plane followed by donovan
gun in hand who covered the retreat

  can you fly her the federal man
asked anxiously as they came up to the
plane

  try to peter agreed reaching for
the switch

  donovan blocked the wheels with
stones then swung his weight on the
propeller the engine coughed spat
are and stopped again he reached for
the varnished wooden blades and jerked
them over the engine roared the
plane bucked and leaped lightly over the
improvised chocks

  hang on yelled peter throttling
down the motor

  got it grunted donovan dragging
and ducking under a wing and swing-
ing himself over the side of the fuse-
lage

  they roared across the plain with the
engine wide open the tail skid lifted
and peter gave her the gun as they
sailed up over the underground hangars
a door opened and a volley of shots
came thundering after them more
doors in die hillside opened the place
sprang into feverish activity

  peter looking down as they gained
altitude saw the great black plane being
wheeled out into the field presently
two smaller planes joined it and all
three stood coughing and roaring ready
for flight

  we ought to stay and fight he
grumbled to himself thats what we
came over here for why the hell are


air stories

we running those birds will all get
away now and god only knows where
theyll head after this

  donovan in the front seat had evi-
dently been thinking the same thing for
he turned and motioned for peter to go
back he reached for his machine gun
and tired a clip to warm it then grinned
wickedly over his shoulder

  peter swung his own gun around and
ran his hand lovingly over its heavy
grip he fired a burst in answer to
donovans and swung the ship around
in a sharp turn far below them the
three black ships were just taking the
air the big bomber winging its slow
awkward way south with the two
smaller planes buzzing and circling
about it like protecting hornets

  donovan motioned with his thumb
that he wanted the planes ahead brought
down peter nodded that he under-
stood and reached for the throttle the
jenny leaped through the air her wires
humming joyously her motor roaring
steadily her sleek bulk rising and fall-
ing like a ship at sea

  peter maneuvered until he had the
sun behind him far below he could
see the big ship with her two convoys
then throttle wide open engine roar-
ing the plane humming he dived

  as he swooped like a hawk on its
prey he felt again that joyous surge of
battle that had come to him during the
war there below him was the enemy

  he reached for the gun and swung it
over with a grin he could see dono-
van both hands grasping the machine
gun peering eagerly ahead at the three
black shapes which seemed to come
rushing up to meet them

  peter jerked the trigger and could
feel the gun jump under his hand one
of the small planes went over into a dive
and slid out of sight the other rolled
over on its side then came roaring up
in a beautiful climb that brought it high
over peters back bullets whined and
rattled through the wire as it opened
fire from its position of advantage

  peter pulled the nose of the ship up

and roared over in a wide loop the
belly of the fighting ship flashed before
his sight and he jerked the triggers
again wisps of smoke trailed away
from the outlaws engine and she fal-
tered in her stride

  got it  peter grunted as he
watched the single-seater crumple into
a whirling cloud of smoke and flame
she fell turning slowly like a leaf slip-
ping off into a spin only to come
tumbling out into a glide as the controls
threshed about unchecked in her cock-
pit

  something roared in peters ears and
a black shape was upon him he caught
one flashing glimpse of a whirling pro-
peller heard the spitting thunder of a
motor and saw a black-hooded figure
leaning out of the cockpit sighting
along the top of an ugly gun

  deadly fingers tugged at the fabric of
the jennys wings and trailed along the
body of the plane the engine coughed
once stuttered and then took up its
steady drone again

  peter reaching for his gun saw that
donovan was in action the machine
gun stood on its base and barked
frenzily at the swooping black shape
roaring down from above

  something smashed against the gun
under his hands and peter felt his
weapon go suddenly dead he clamped
down on the rudder-bar with his feet
pulled back on the stick and felt his
ship rise suddenly on its tail

  there was a blinding crash a rending
of wood and canvas and a flash of
flame a shock went trembling from
propeller to rudder of the jenny and
she stood still in the air quivering like a
stricken bird her landing gear twisted
and entwined about the stump of the
propeller and the rushed fuselage o
the black outlaw

  for an instant the two planes locked
together hung motionless in midair
then the black ship fell away twisted
over on her back and plunged scream-
ing and fluttering toward the ground

  the joy-stick crashed in peters
the sky horse



hands as his plane rocked from side
to side like a wounded animal then
tilted forward with the weight of the
engine and went into a deadly headlong
rush for the brown whirling earth
below

  as he fought the controls battling
desperately to right the ship peter saw
the white strained face of donovan
peering back at him from the forward
cockpit donovan knew what was hap-
pening he knew their chances for life
or death hung in the balance now

  with arms that seemed helpless and
numb peter grasped the stick and
hauled back with all his strength the
rudder-bar jerked under his feet and
the brown earth rushed up to meet him

  the engine burst into sound again
roaring mightily and the plane leveled
out with a shrieking of canvas and
wires-bumped over invisible rough
spots in the air and settled down to an
even flight with one wing hanging
slightly lower than the other and rib-
bons of fabric trailing after her like a
bullet-torn battle flag

  from somewhere in the distance
peter heard the pound of another gun
and wondered vaguely where it could
be then he saw that donovan was
firing at something that moved below
them glancing over the side peter
found himself staring directly down at
the broad body and great wings of the
black ship she had turned north dur-
ing the flight and was now winging her
way steadily into california toward
some mysterious destination known only
to those hooded men who crouched in
her wide cockpit between the roaring
twin motors

  donovan his face a question mark
glanced back at the pilot his jaw was
set his mouth grim and the joy of
battle blazed in his gray eyes peter
knew what donovan was asking him
he knew the question written on the
white face ahead could he go on and
fight the big ship did he have the
strength and the courage to pilot his
crippled plane into another attack

  peter set his teeth and nodded he
could with his own gun jammed his
landing gear smashed to splinters one
wing wobbling flabbily he was ready to
go in and finish the job

  donovan nodded his approval and
turned again to his gun peter nosed
the plane down and dived

  the men in the big ship below had
located their enemy and were making
desperate effort to get away the twin
motors roared furiously from the
rear cockpit came the steady pounding
of a gun

  peter grinned as he heard the familiar
sound of bullets ripping through the
wings rotten shots those men in the
big plane he reflected but he must
stick to his job pilot the jenny to the
last they must bring that black ship
down hang on its tail and fight it until
it was either driven to earth or the
pilots were killed that ship had the
precious cargo they were after in it
lay the hope of solving the mystery of
the border smugglers

  donovan poured a stream of fire into
the body of the big ship as they flashed
by peter turned banked and came
roaring back to the attack again

  he noticed the big plane was losing
altitude steadily the ground below
getting greener now appeared much
nearer

  again and again he dived and heard
donovans gun thunder banked and
came over to gain altitude and dive
again

  the tops of trees flashed by under-
neath now and he could see fields and
wooded parks and on the right a high-
way with a long line of motor cars
moving peacefully along the roar from
tijuana to san diego he guessed
numbly turning the nose of the plane
again to the attack

  he saw the big ship falter tilt rak-
ishly over on its side and go plunging
toward the ground men tumbled fran-
tically about the cockpit trying to right
her but evidently the shots from dono-
vans gun had severed some of her con-


air stories

irol wires she fell awkwardly her

tail making wide circles in the air

  donovan was motioning over his
shoulder peter saw signaling for him
to follow the big ship down to land he
nodded and set himself for the ordeaj
ahead

  peter saw a puff of smoke and heard
the faint crash as the black outlaw
plowed into the ground he saw small
black figures climbing from her fusel-
age

  the ground rushed up to meet him
he gripped the stick grimly and held on
he knew that he must keep the jennys
nose up land with the tail first to break
the force of the fall if he wanted to
avoid a fatal crash that thought kept
whirling through his mind-hold the
nose up-hold the nose up bank and let
her down easy

  he felt the tail touch and lurched
forward as the skid bit into the soft
grass the body struck with a crash
the plane bounded into the air and flut-
tered like a cirppled hawk then it
nosed forward the propeller struck
and flew into splinters and the body
tilted slowly over

  the jenny stood on her nose like a
trained seal in a circus the injured
wing gave way at last and ripped off to
act as a breaker the plane fell for-
ward on her back leaving donovan and
peter suspended upside down like bats
under her bullet-riddled body

  donovan was the first to hit the
ground he loosened his safety belt
and tumbled out gun in hand to fall in
a heap on the grass below peter saw
him running toward the wreck of the
black outlaw the automobiles along
the highway had stopped and a crowd
of men were running from the road to-
ward the two planes

  peter unsnapped his belt and fell to
the ground he sat up felt of his
shoulder and gazed vaguely across at
the other plane three men had climbed
out of the cockpit a fourth slumped
like a sodden bundle of leather against
the seat inside

  donovan was talking his heavy auto-
matic pressed against the stomach of the

nearest flyer

  now come through he barked
what were you up to what kind of
cargo are you carrying in this bus any-
way 

  one of the pilots waved his hand to-
ward the fuselage of the black plane
he had his other hand tucked into his
flying coat as a sling and blood oozed
from a puncture in his right shoulder

  donovan readied over and jerked
open the trap door in the body of the
plane a frightened yellow face ap-
peared in the opening and a thin voice
chattered in chinese

  well ill le damned roared dono-
van so this is the game runnin
chinks across the border well ill
be damned 

  seven cringing trembling frightened
chinese came crawling out the body
of the plane to huddle in a pathetic
group under the commanding eye of
jim donovan

  the motorists whose morning ride
had been so suddenly interrupted by the
air battle overhead arrived on the scene
now and swarmed about the captured
plane and its passengers

  jim donovan after turning them all
over to a motorcycle policeman who ar-
rived breathless and excited turned back
to peter crisp he dropped a friendly
hand on peters shoulder

  boy youre some flyer he said
slowly after i get through talking
with the world famous picture people
theyre going to take you back as their
crack stunt pilot you can count on
that i knew you had guts from the
first youve proved yourself today
from now on you can count old jim
donovan as your friend

  thanks jim said peter weakly
damn fine of you to speak to the world
famous people for me but jim what
i want right now more than anything
else is-a cigarette

  and peter crisp slid slowly forward
to the grass unconscious
crashing to glory

by richard a martinsen

two daredevil young pilots-a glorious girl-and bitter rivalry in the blue

depths of the skies i

the blind spot of the old
gussie death-traps you may re-
member was about nine-tenths of
the entire horizon so when cadet
burns wiggled his joy-stick and shot
her up under the ark cadet manning
was trying to wrestle in a straight line
between the pilons fifteen instructors
and about ninety other cadets got a keen
hunch as to what was going to happen
next

  the blithering ass snapped cap-
tain crocker-only he didnt exactly say
blithering dont he know its man-
nings first trip alone

  hells bells pollock the senior in-
structor retorted impolitely without re-
moving his eyes from the azure heavens
burns is in the same boat his first
hop too-and it sure looks as though it
were going to be his last

  there was reasonable grounds for this
pessimistic statement manning had

been coasting along serenely unaware
that anyone was within a dozen miles of
him a fraction of a second after pol-
locks last word he hit a bump and a
big one his ship dropped like a plum-
met about forty feet burns prop
chewed into its tail like an auger sheer-
ing away great chunks of it-including
rudder elevator and skid then hav-
ing inflicted enough damage for one
afternoon the prop itself splintered to
matchwood and there were two nice
young cadets strung out on a wide wide
limb fortunately the limb was as high
up as it was wide a good twenty-five
hundred fortunately also when man-
ning did come to life he reacted with
gratifying dispatch his rudderless
ship turned a couple of flip-flops and a
somersault then whizzed into a final
plunge before it had gathered much
momentum however a dark object shot
over its side well below it suddenly




air stories

blossomed into a white carnation
manning had jumped in the nick of
time and pulled his chute

  glory be sighed crocker who had
just been appointed co of the field
and was anxious to hold down casual-
ties as much as possible

  pollock had seen the chute open out
of the comer of an eye he was now
absorbed in the fate of cadet burns
rocking about up there without prop and
still less control burns had craved a
real tryout and he was getting it if
his fingers froze to the stick-the usual
failing of half-baked pilots in an
emergency - his sorrowing comrades
would say the next verse with flowers

  after a few spasms of informal sky
writing the gussie paused to catch its
breath shivered in diabolic anticipation
and whanged into a blistering nose-dive

  good night grunted lieutenant
pollock

  ambulance rapped captain crocker
over his shoulder to an orderly

  but whether by a stroke of genius
or blind luck burns fooled them both
two hundred feet from the ground he
pulled her out of it as neatly as though
the whole thing had been innocent fun
coasted came up in a stall and pan-
caked settling on one wheel with all the
stunning impact of a feather

  god protects children pollock
vouchsafed with a short dry laugh

  yeh but i wont averred the
co grimly and set out at a double for
the crippled ship

  the other argosy had crashed in a
thicket outside the field blazing merrily
as was the habit of gussies on the
slightest provocation mannings chute
however had dumped him roughly
about the same time bums landed and
not more than fifty yards away

  the co saw his stocky figure dis-
entangle itself from the maze of cor-
dage and gallop madly forward a
tall slender figure hopped out of the
cockpit of the propless plane the two
men met halfway they stood upon no
ceremony a flurry of erratic punches

then each  settled back upon his heels
and cut loose in a vicious slugging-bee
right left-right left-right left-
the slender figure collided with an
especially accurate pile-driver and stag-
gered back the stocky man closed in
on him with a rush they clinched
hammering at back and kidneys with a
wild abandon

  it was at this point captain crocker
injected himself into the action picture
he landed upon both combatants like a
ton of bricks all three bit dust in a
confused and writhing heap

  the captain was a big man and a
husky one he heaved up dragging a
spluttering cadet by the collar in either
hand

  attention you blankety-blankety
fools he roared and when they had
in some measure obeyed him dont
you think youve done enough damage
without attempting murder 

  my first hop spat manning apo-
plectically and he had to go and
ruin it

  ruin hell yowled burns with ap-
propriate gestures there was plenty
of room you came down ninety miles
to get me you lantern-jawed sap
shut up key down the captain
adjured them in no uncertain tones
ill do the talking now every dash-
blank word of it youre both under
arrest hike back to barracks and stay
there until i send for you and if
theres any more scrapping or even a
sign of it ill clamp you in the guard-
house for fifty years

vreh theyve got spirit all right
jl captain crocker conceded to lieu-
tenant pollock at headquarters after
supper that night too doggone much
id say it was a crime to stop that
battle but there was more than just
an accident behind it jim it looked
to me more like the climax of a private
feud have you got any low-down on
those two 

  the lieutenant nodded and grinned
uh-huh im summat older but we
crashing to glory-



all three hail from the same village in
dear old maine neil burns-hes the
stocky hatchet-faced one-is the son of
our respected postmaster dave man-
ning acknowledges our leading grocer
as his pa you know how small towns
are generally split up into cliques
well manning senior is a stanch re-
publican burns senior is an equally
stanch democrat the kids are both
good boys but theyve been rivals of
one sort or another ever since they
kicked off diapers its in the blood
i guess whatever one tackles tother
dives in too and tries to go him better
but howd they both land here at
love joy 

  search me  shrugged pollock
manning passed his tests and reported
here in april burns wasnt two weeks
behind manning was scheduled to
take the first test for his commission
this afternoon burns asked to go up
too he lit a cigaret and puffed it
thoughtfully they both have the
makings of good flyers-if it wasnt for
their childish everlasting competition
it wont be everlasting its going
to stop right now the co promised
he pressed a buzzer sergeant send
for cadets manning and burns

  the pair came to him at headquarters
in physical company but with spirits a
few dozen stars apart burns rather
solemn heavy features were set and
stern a slight flush tinted mannings
more comely alert face the eyes of
both cadets were focused resolutely
straight ahead of them

  i understand you birds have brought
your private differences to lovejoy
field the captain bruskly began i
dont know how much they played a
part in what transpired this afternoon
but i do know therell be no more of
it youre in the army now also
youre both skating on darned thin ice
do i make myself quite plain

  yes sir answered manning
gravely burns merely nodded

  all right so much for that said
captain crocker as for the sinash-

up-well burns i dont think you
crowded manning with malicious intent
if i did i wouldnt stop to argue but
just the same it was a damn fool stunt
dyou want a formal court

  burns gulped not-not if its all
the same to you sir

  then ill pass judgment myself
youre on the ground for thirty days-
an dash-blank lucky at that in the
meantime manning youre to take the
final tests lieutenant pollock please
see to it that by the time burns ground
term expires manning is either in the
infantry or a gentleman and pilot by
act of congress-and three full flying
days away from here

  emerging from headquarters bums
turned on manning with an irate sparkle
in his chill black eyes

  youve got your wish you lucky
stiff

  what wish is that neil manning
asked with a deceptive suavity

  to put me on the ground so you can
get your bars and pass the good word
to the folks at home

  youre goofy fella i wouldnt
bother to stave-up even a gussie crate
for that id of beat you to it anyway
-just like i always have

  maiming spoke lightly and bis lips
were parted in an impulsive amiable
grin which burns ignored

  always always he rumbled
angrily youre a gosh-darn liar
dave he doubled his fists but as the
other made no move went on i beat
you out in swimming football an
track i can beat the spots out of you
in anything yeh flying too

  mannings grin had faded but he still
persisted in his effort at conciliation

  looky neil were not children any
longer also were heading for over
yonder and only god knows what then
we might as well call off the fireworks
and part as friends what say

  burns chin thrust up and out he
looked away

  you go to grass he rumbled sul-
lenly at last youve got me where


air stories

you want me but my turn will come
some day yeh some day dave man-
ning ill show you what real flying is
ill take your ornery carcass apart an
scatter it from hell to breakfast all over
the deep blue sky i

  okay retorted manning shortly
since thats the way you feel about
h-

  he bit off the hot words welling up
in him turned and strode away

its an offense against the legisla-
ture for it to rain in hawaii ex-
cept during january but then jupe
pluvius certainly does spread himself
the water pours with all the pep and
vinegar of the fine spray in the family
shower-bath and the globules are about
the size of marbles

  lieutenant dave manning stood in
the doorway of the army flyers club
on ford island and peered through the
sizzling curtain of the torrential deluge
in the general direction of pearl har-
bor all things considered his clean-
clipped face was pretty cheerful dave
had won the reputation of being a
pretty cheerful lad in every way which
made his brother shavetails cotton to
him like molasses

  what-ho he shot over his shoul-
der in the direction of a desultory five-
handed poker game darned if it dont
look like the chateau thierry stickin
her old nose into port

  the transport snap to attention
then you long-legged gi can re-
torted a flippant voice colonel ma-
thias oliver the new co will be
aboard

  gosh glad i aint a member of
the reception committee dave gin-
gerly extended a hand from under the
roof of the veranda and the rain slapped
down on it like a faucet i guess i
know when im well off the old boy
means nothing whatever in my young
life

  but he was dead wrong as he was
subsequently to discover the field gave
colonel oliver and the commissioned

replacements who had arrived with him
a welcome dinner that night young
manning assigned a distant table with
the other juniors didnt get a good look
at the guest of honor until the meal was
well under way then he froze goggle-
eyed and almost choked on a spoonful
of hot soup

  it wasnt on the slender colonel with
the iron-gray mustaches that daves orbs
clamped so frenziedly however but the
golden-haired damsel demurely seated
at his side if ever a radiant fragment
had tumbled out of heaven she sure
was it her lips were priceless rubies
her teeth were pearls her eyes were
glowing-

  hey  hey cried stuffy luchens
jabbing dave with a sharp elbow
come to life you bloomin idol

  who-how- muttered the idol
vaguely

  molly-o the darlin daughter of out
new co

  oh

  yeh molly-o now snap out of
it dyou crave to get in bad right off
the bat

  er-no said dave staring all the
harder and it so happened that
molly-os glance roving aimlessly
chanced on the shavetails gaping map
which drew an amused smile from her
-and ruined dave completely for the
rest of the evening he didnt notice
what he ate even when stuffy dumped
most of the salt-cellar on his ice-cream
and the various speeches drummed like
dim gibberish in his ears even for
an army sub he was decidedly well
smitten

  shock number two and a somewhat
less pleasant one came no later than the
following morning  jupe pluvius had
called it off for a few hours dave
sauntering leisurely along officers row
caught the distant flutter of a pink silk
skirt and threw his gears in high half-
way to the girl he pulled up with a sud-
den grunt the square-cut jib of the
officer with miss oliver was painfully
familiar neil burns and hanged if
crashing to glory	

the pair of them werent thick as axle-
grease

  burns and the divine enchantment
drifted m laughing intimacy out to the
flying field where a few planes were
doing their daily dozen dave trailed
them thoughtfully all at once he
chuckled and increased his pace
abreast of burns he saluted snappily

  well well lieutenant how do you
do he warbled with a cheerful grin
fancy our meeting here

  burns face remained stonily cold as
he returned the salute

  how-do mr manning

  he swung elaborately back to the
girl dave flushed but there was noth-
ing for it he had to amble on

   other officials began to materialize in
the close neighborhood of miss olivers
dainty form soon she was the center
of a chattering group among them cap-
tain carter the dapper adjutant dave
circled and found an opportunity to
twick the captains sleeve

  introduce me like a good guy
hum dye think id better
molly-o is dynamite quoth captain
carver but presently the deed was
done and dainty miss oliver wiped
away all daves irritation and his re-
maining brains with another of her
flashing smiles-an extra-special

  captain carver talked and chick mee-
han talked and stuffy luchens talked
and the stony-faced bums talked but
what they were saying didnt percolate
it was a quarter of an hour before
dave abruptly snapped to life molly-o
herself had the floor then and her dis-
course seemed directed straight at him
although her perky nose was turned
toward carver

  oh im a flying fool i guess its
in the blood if theres anything that
gets under my skin its a top-hole pilot
hitting the roof and knocking holes in
it i just worship stunting her
hand fluttered to her heart and her
eyes sparkled bewitchingly im just
a silly romantic flapper i suppose-
but if any lochinvar sneaks me away

hell come a-swooping through the air
dave found himself staring intently
at neil bums who returned his gaze
with interest sparks seemed to fly
two souls with but a single thought
they were too self-engrossed to see the
shadow of the wings of fate fluttering
darkly in the background

   that night at the club dave braced a
shavetail who had accompanied the col-
onel on the transport

  burns oh neil bums yes he
came on with us replied the new-
comer  before then we were together
at mitchell field dyou know him
well

   so-so

   the new arrival regarded dave curi-
ously strikes me that hes a sorta sul-
len cuss but boy he surely packs a
drag with fair miss oliver shes plain
nutty over circus flyin y know burns
landed at mitchell too late to show what
he can do but when the colonel was or-
dered to hawaii burns broke a leg to
get a transfer out here with him-and
molly-o if he can fly as well as he
can talk he must be good

  dave nodded without answering to
himself he muttered grimly neil beat
me out at tennis track and football
looks like were going to have another
game-an this onell sure be tougher

ieutenant manning de-
voted every faculty to rushing
molly oliver off her feet since lieu-
tenant burns had a fairish edge on him
and clung to it doggedly the competi-
tion became fast and furious ford
island chuckled broadly gave the
youngsters leeway and sat back to watch
the fun both shavetails had joined the
army to make war on germany the
powers that be at washington had jug-
gled the strings and chevvied them
about ten thousand miles from that par-
ticular country but they were making
war all right with everything they had

  nobody got more of a kick out of
the proceedings than the officers who
had been stationed with colonel oliver


air stories

back in the states they knew the po-
tentialities of mixing the pet obsession
of incurably romantic molly-o with the
wild ardor of two love-smitten bird-
men the way to mollys heart was
through supremacy in the air she
made that plain to both of her young
gallants from the very first

  to complicate matters still further
colonel oliver had most emphatic no-
tions about army pilots who took un-
necessary risks this was brought
home to the rivals quite promptly the
morning dave tried to steal a march on
burns by a little informal hippodrom-
ing neil had escorted molly to the
flying field dave grasped the oppor-
tunity to hop off in his greased light-
ning single-seater sx scout he started at
five thousand and knocked off twenty -
seven loops the last one was well
below the dead-line of on-rfusand
in fact it all but scraped the engine
off the gleaming racers nose

  molly clapped her hands in beatific
ecstasy her father reacted too but
somewhat differently five minutes
later dave was facing the flushed and
fuming colonel across his h q desk

  olivers first few hundred words were
oratorical-spoken for effect and re-
quiring no answer whatsoever

  how in the name of beelzebub dye
get that way he ended presently
mainly to catch his breath

 i-i-

  this aint the navy keep your aye-
ayes for the blinkin marines the col-
onel thundered on his toes again and
anyway thats enough out of you young
man now listen closely i dont care
a tinkers damn about you if you
want to cash in on your war risk insur-
ance thats your private funeral hop
to it in your own blistering assinine
way but dont you dare do it in gov-
ernment property you hear me those
s x scouts cost money-more than
youll ever earn good god and you
set out deliberately to crack one   

  with which the colonel again lapsed
into a semi-coherency but all in all

he made himself quite plain not only
to manning but to everyone within a
radius of a good half-mile dave left
headquarters a sadder if not altogether
a wiser man

  thereafter for several weeks compe-
tition for miss oliver was conducted on
prosaic ground much to that alluring
maids discomfiture what little flying
burns and manning did was strictly in
line of duty and-under the colonels
frowning eagle eye - their practise
stunting was safe sane orthodox and
high above the fleecy clouds

  stuffy luchens in the club one night
delivered a summary of the situation to
his grinning cronies

 round six breaks are even
molly-o thinks more of either fair
charmer when tother is away-and that
aint often what i mean duke and
luke the mucilage kids therell be
a sure-nough explosion some day
though sort of an aerial climax wot
you cant keep good men down he
guffawed at his own witticism then
added reflectively dave manning is a
right good scout i hope he makes the
grade

  me too announced chick meehan
but i have my doubts

 yeh why a dozen voices
queried

  well- chick hesitated then went
on reluctantly i think that as a flyer
burns has the edge on him not much
-but- he waggled a dubious head
those fish-eyed lads are hard to lick
when they make up their minds to any-
thing alas how well i know

 humph looks like a perpetual
stale-mate to me grunted lieutenant
bob badham from a far corner long
as colonel oliver sticks around therell
be no cloud clownishness whatever and
from present indications hes sitting on
the lid for life

  bobs conclusion was logical enough
save that fate had again chosen to flut-
ter its portentous wings even at that
moment a starry-eyed damsel snuggled
beside neil bums on a sofa in colonel
crashing to glory



olivers living-room was whispering
excitedly

  can you keep a secret neil well
then-daddy lias been invited by ad-
miral pierce to take a cruise around
maui an inspection or something
anyway he leaves day after tomorrow
and may be gone a wreek isnt that
glorious  ill have some nice long rides
with you and dave and see what each
of you can really do

  aw neil protested uneasily i
wouldnt want to take a chance with
you along molly i-

  is that so she stamped a foot
imperiously well then ill talk to
dave im sure he wont refuse
if thats the way you feel about it
the broad sky is the limit kid the
square-jawed youth assured her hastily
i can fly rings around that fella any
day

  the news of colonel olivers im-
pending journey was publicly pro-
claimed the following afternoon where-
at ford island which knew that molly
could twist the adjutant about her little
finger perked up and gurgled with a
world of meaning

  ah

gold and blue combined in one
of those glorious sunlit mornings
the islanders swear by the pink-toed
prophet can be witnessed nowhere else
in this sad world nevertheless not so
much as one solitary wing-tip flecked
the inviting sky all of which consid-
ering the fact that every blessed air
hawk and mechanic in the outfit had
found business near the hangars was
passing strange-unless you happen to
know army flyers theyll breeze through
a howling hell of archie in a state of
bored indifference then sit down
a-wriggle with the wildest excitement
before a punch-and-judy show 

  the show ford island was anticipat-
ing this morning however was not en-
tirely slapstick comedy it was in fact
a show-down between two very resolute
and reckless young men ford island

    a-s-aotr-

fully sensed the underlying current of
gravity so despite their untroubled
faces did lieutenants manning and
burns so too despite a steady stream
of animated chatter did molly-o

  the only officer not in the immediate
distance when molly led her two vic-
tims into the arena was captain carver
the dapper adjutant after escorting
colonel oliver to admiral pierces flag-
ship carver had adjourned to the deep-
est storm-cellar in the flyers club there
to propitiate his official conscience with
a few shots of three star hennessy
it was on his shoulders that responsi-
bility would rest if any trouble devel-
oped while the colonel was away

  good hunting exclaimed molly-o
sniffing the dulcet breeze gee ive
waited a thousand years for such a
gorgeous opportunity whos going to
take me up first 

  they matched for it and manning
won two minutes later the girl had
clambered gracefully into the fore cock-
pit of a gleaming powerful rv

  oh im just thrilled to death she
cooed ecstatically as manning fastened
her belt

  shes liable to be no foolin before
its over stuffy luchens remarked
somberly to bob badham by the hangar
doors he spat and added unexpect-
edly  aw the little sap and
even gallant kentucky robert failed to
disagree

  the rv taxied smoothly manning
lifted her circled once to gather power
then zoomed in a steep crawl to the
upper atmosphere his face was still
inscrutable but there was a hint of bit-
ter inward turmoil in his eyes

  presently molly-o flung up a hand
and turned toward him she was
flushed with a gay excitement dave
nosed down and cut the motor so he
could catch her words

  hi whats the big idea sir launce-
lot we going to loaf around up here
all day get busy and strut your
stuff

  he nodded his perplexity had sud-


air stories

denly been succeeded by definite deci-
sion he bored the rv down until the
wind whined like a devils chorus
through her quivering struts then
pulled her up again and over until she
seemed to be standing on the extreme tip
of her right wing

  around down and up again the v
banked dizzily in a great figure eight
this looks astounding and hazardous
from the ground but in reality its no
such thing

  for five full minutes dave kept her
twirling first on one wing then the
other-but he wasnt fooling molly-o
her eyebrow-s puckered in an ominous
frown emphatically she waved her
hand again

  back to the kindergarten old dear
what dyou think youre doing kidding
me i came up here to fly any
darned cadet could pull this baby stuff
and go to sleep at that im getting
awfly disappointed dave do snap
me out of it

  lines of regret bit deep in mannings
forehead as he bent over the stick he
redoubled his exertions the plane
wove intricate figures all over the place
giving every symptom of an abandoned
sky-mania but doing nothing really
dangerous dave was not going to cast
the life of the girl he loved on the un-
certain altar of the air gods it hurt
to see the storm clouds of disfavor
gathering so swiftly on her childish face
but he had made his bet and he stuck
to it doggedly

  a third and last time molly-o flung
up her arm trembling with the violence
of her emotions

  ive had enough of this she cried
as a stunt flyer dave manning youre
a false alarm take me down no
argument theres a real pilot waiting
for me down below

  dave leveled the plane swung lazily
back across the harbor and glided in a
long whistling incline to the landing
field his heart was heavy his brain
however seethed with helpless anger
wrhat was the use of being so darned

virtuous when it just made you a first-

class goat 

  the rvs wheels hit dirt and the tail
settled lightly dave cut off the motor
a few feet from the hangar doors neil
burns rushed up in the van of half a
dozen officers they helped molly from
the cockpit and escorted her across to
neils waiting ship another power-
ful rv

  still manning didnt move he was
too busy fighting dowrn that helpless
blinding rage a false alarm shed
called him-just because he wouldnt
risk her neck oh hell    

  the spitting roar of burns motor cut
the air neil might le sullen upon oc-
casion but he was no ones fool he
had witnessed daves performance with
a shrewd and calculating relish now
he was going to show the poor boob up
neil wanted molly-o with every fiber
of his being if the only wav to get
her was to tear holes in the deep blue
sky-well that was that

  neil ran a couple of hundred yards
and lifted her as gently as a cradle rock-
ing in a summer breeze back in the
other rv dave manning stiffened and
beckoned some loitering mechanics

  contact he roared

  the big prop whirled and caught
dave opened the gun and raced the rv
madly across the field in the wake of
the other plane it didnt take him any
two hundred yards to make the air he
jerked his stick and fairly flung her off
the ground

  a fraction of a second before she
lifted the rv hit a bump-the edge of
a deep-buried boulder the impact was
scarcely perceptible yet enough to snap
a loosened angle-cleat on the landing
gear the startled watchers saw the
rv take the air her left wheel crumpled
and dragging like the foot of a wounded
bird

  great gosh cried stuffy luchens
anguishedly hes gone and done it
and-say bob he doesnt know

then its kinda up to us to advertise
the happy fact bob badham muttered
crashing to glory



and set off for the nearest hangar at
a run

  absorbed in fiery emotions manning
hadnt even felt that tell-tale jar so
molly-o believed he was a false alarm
eh  this thrust had stung dave harder
than all the rest impetuously he set
out to disprove it he drove the plane
past bums ship like a belated tornado
noting with grim satisfaction the sur-
prised look on mollys face up up he
climbed until the rv was no bigger
than a speck against the brilliant sun
then dave cut loose with every circus
stunt in his extensive repertoire loops
immelmans fluttering leafs-on his
back-wing-tips-nose-tail he mixed
old stunts with an amazing variety of
new ones coined for the occasion and
all hair-raising to the wth degree

  a false alarm eh  dave put on still
more speed it seemed at any moment
that the overtaxed plane would splat-
ter in a thousand pieces still dave
drove on in a mad orgy of sky rioting

the army flying field had sud-
denly become a hotbed of activity
soldiers darted about waving their arms
like madmen luchens and badham
hindered rather than helped by a flock
of crowding mechanics began to tear
a wheel from a shop dolly chick mee-
han and a half-dozen other officers
shouted conflicting instructions at a
squad spreading a square of canvas in
the center of the landing field this
was intended to attract the attention of
the crippled plane

  dave manning was far too busy with
his thundering acrobatics to spare atten-
tion for any other thing molly-o
watched him with a fascinated swiftly
mounting wonder in her shining eyes

  it was a startled shout from neil
burns audible above the engines roar
that recalled her to more immediate sur-
roundings burns was leaning rigidly
over the side of the ship glance riveted
on the landing field molly looked
down too uneasily she grasped the
unusual bustle and stir in addition to

the erratic swarming of two hundred
men cars were now dashing back and
forth at express speed

  look cried molly excitedly ex-
tending her arm and as burns cut the
engine an ambulance whats
wrong down there

  it aint down there groaned neil
abysmally its right up here with us
see those fellers on the canvas waving
something we must have smacked a
rock or timber in the take-off theyre
signaling weve lost a wheel

  the gravity of the situation dawned
slowly on the wide-eyed girl then she
swung anxiously back to burns she
wanted him to laugh to soothe away her
fears one glance at his set face how-
ever told her neil had no sympathy to
was he wore the expression of a
haunted man

  well-whats to be done about it
she shouted at last

  bums wriggled from his life belt and
hung far over the side of the cockpit
craning his neck in an effort to gauge the
damage but the w-heel trucks were be-
yond his range of vision

  the plane lurched drunkenly he al-
most fell back into his seat and re-
adjusted the life belt hastily

  cant do anything he told her with
a glum shake of his head were sunk
thats all

  you mean-were going to crash
mollys voice was shrill with apprehen-
sion how dreadful neil if youre
any good at all youll get us out of this 
he glared at her disgustedly the
ignorant little fool then his glance
again fixed darkly on the ground below

  gawd whyn hell dont they stop
waving that cursed wheel  he snarled
to himself they trying to mb it in
we know it we know it you gosh-
damed idiots

  as if his sentiments had carried the
wild excitement on the field abruptly
ceased men hastily rolled up the can-
vas and removed every obstacle that
might block an easy landing then all
and sundry withdrew to the sidelines
air stories

 

to await the voice of fate with true
flyers stoicism only the white ambu-
lance drawn up conveniently at one side
remained a mute reminder of what was
expected to ensue

  dave manning- had managed to wear
out his fury flirting with the topmost
fleecy clouds he actually felt serene
again after an instant of leisurely
idling he jammed down the rvs nose
and slid from the ceiling at a wild and
giddy clip passing neils ship he
waved half-derisively and his white
teeth flashed a flippant grin

  damn you shrieked neil in a blaze
of uncontrollable fury shaking his fist
at his rivals rapidly dwindling back
you lucky stiff i had you stopped
six ways from sunday but now youve
got me where you want me havent you
-you yellow-bellied farmer go ahead
and laugh

  molly did not hear the words but she
caught his furious gestures

  i bet dave would get me down all
right she cried

   neil read her lips enough to catch her
meaning

  you go to grass he shouted sav-
agely and with that he proceeded to
forget her devoting himself entirely to
his own emergency

  dave manning crackled down toward
the landing field mildly wondering why
the other rv was cruising so sedately
instead of flipping handsprings across
the sky

  i guess neils just prolonging things
at my expense the old sonuvagun he
concluded hell begin to show me up
to molly pretty soon

  the thought induced a frown which
was suddenly supplanted by a reflective
grin

 well anyway molly-os discovered
im not a false alarm he told himself
outside of that who cares

  dave didnt and proceeded to dem-
onstrate he gave his plane the gun
and shot within ten feet of the ground
like a hurtling catapult one last stunt
dave had decided wouldnt do him any

harm he leveled off pulled back the

stick as far as it would go and cut 
out the motor

  it was an awe-inspiring stall the
rv stood on her tail like an intoxicated
sardine for a brief instant she hung
there shivering-then trembled on the
verge of a back-slip

  per-r-r-r-rf the engine roared again i
as dave hauled the big plare out of it
apparently by sheer main force down
came the rvs nose in an erratic arc
almost scraping the ground and up t
again as the young dare-devil pancaked j

  the ship seemed almost to freeze in
space settle and float to the ground- 
as pretty a landing as one could ask to
see both wheels bit dirt together it j
was the merest split-second before the j
left one gave bending at a sharp angle 
from the vertical but that split-second 
was enough the pancake had practi- f
cally killed all forward momentum -
the rvs tail settled as lightly as a
whispering breeze and the ship stood j
motionless

  dave opened the gun again to taxi 
to the hangars and felt the rv pull in 
a series of rough jerks like a ship tug- 
ging at its anchor chains the left
wing began to swing in a wide circle

  what the hell thought dave he v
cut the engine unhooked his belt and
scrambled blithely from the cockpit to
investigate well wouldnt that plaster
you  ive gone and broke a wheel

molly-os face was pale but the
girl after all was of a valiant
fighting breed she waved at neil until
she managed to break his dour abstrac-
tion and he coasted

  lets go on down and get it over
with she cried

  burns eyes minted with an unpleas-
ant light

  all right he bit out curtly but
remember you asked for it

  he tilted the planes nose downward
in a wavering uncertain arc those
on the ground were too engrossed dis-
cussing daves impossible feat to spare
a glance for the uninjured ship other-
crashing to glory



wise they might have wondered what
had struck its cocky pilot

  neil wasnt a quitter he would have
faced wars perils-even dark uncer-
tainty-without a qualm but here was
no uncertainty at all the ship was
doomed the only question was how
badly they would crash

  the last two minutes were a night-
mare neil wallowed in the throes of
a black numbing apathy which height-
ened as he neared the ground a fren-
zied gesture by molly passed unnoticed
she turned drumming the fuselage
madly with her clenched fists

  neil neil wake up 

  he raised lack-lustre eyes the girls
drawn face beat into his morbid con-
sciousness huh manning wasnt
such a lucky stiff after all the grim
thought flashed neil wouldnt take a
radiant molly to the altar certainly-
but neither would dave

  the ground swept dizzily up to meet
them at the instant when it seemed
that they must crash nose on some
measure of his faculties returned to
neil there was one chance in a mil-
lion and he took it leveling the ship
he pulled up her nose and stalled her
in a desperate effort to pancake and kill
his fatal speed

  it was the stunt dave manning had
pulled as his finale ordinarily neil
would have had a fighting chance to
make it too but that stark apathy-
the knowledge that the plane was crip-
pled and doomed-had blunted the fine
edge of hi skill the plane back-
slipped with a convulsive effort neil
strove to pull her out of it-and the
engine failed to catch

  death staring them in the face neil
bums fought furiously with the
weight of his straining body he suc-
ceeded partially in righting the ship
but there was a point beyond which
mortal resources proved futile the
back-slip changed into a fluttering side-

slip the rvs left wing struck the
ground heavily and crumpled

  struts snapped with a sinister whang
there was the rip of tearing fabric as
though writhing in a final dying shud-
der the rv flopped slowly over on her
back   

stuffy luchens bob badham
chick meehan and a score of
others racing up at a dead run found
the girl unconscious though uninjured
and neil struggling with savage curses
at his tangled safety belt

  what the blazes was the big idea
coming down thataway bawled stuf-
fy as a dozen hands lifted molly gently
to the ground

  hown blazes did you expect me to
come down- neil shot furiously back
at him-with a crippled landing gear
crippled landing gear repeated
stuffy amazedly what the dickens
did you have one too

  too neil tried his weight on a
swelling right ankle and dropped with
a wry grimace too luchens what
the devil are you driving at 

  by this time stuffy had seen a ray of
light he was hard put to it to repress
a caustic grin

  why you poor fish you must
have seen the signals we intended for
dave manning he cracked his left
wheel in the take-off but yours is
perfectly all right was i mean he
added hastily viewing the sad remnants
of the big rv what a gorgeous mess
youve made of her old top

  ill tell the world  it was molly-os
voice weak but vibrant with a note of
passionate intensity and there was
nothing wrong with our plane at all
good night she sighed and looked
eagerly in the direction of a slender ad-
vancing form dave oh david man-
ning    wont somebody tell the
best darn pilot west of boston that im
calling him

of the

g louds

by
thomson burtis

along the border from the gulf
of mexico to the gulf of cali-
fornia stretches a land which has
been the setting for uncounted songs
and stories and the scene of numberless
life-and-death dramas more romantic
more deadly more human than words
on paper can convey in the days of the
old west the rio grande the pecos the
big bend the deserts-all were names
fraught with meaning because they
brought with them associations of a
pioneer country where men of the out-
doors fought their way against nature
and each other by the rudimentary law
of the individual

  and only the hardiest among men
and animals could survive for long
whether in the primitive warfare


against heat and storm and desert waste
or in the flashing battle of six-gun and
knife

  today in the twentieth century that
same land still stubbornly resists the
march of cities and factories and blos-
soming farms there are hundreds of
miles of mesquite wilderness where a
man can wander for days without food
or water the big bend vast and for-
bidding still harbors men whom a none
too particular country has outlawed the
flaming deserts of the far southwest
are deadly as of yore and the struggle
of the border is going  as it was fifty
years ago-not so open a struggle per-
haps but still raw and elemental

  there are still men along the border
who prize their ability to draw and shoot
and ride as priceless because those

beginning a smashing novel of
grinning gringo air hawks mile-
high battle and reckless romance
on the lawless rio grande
riders of the clouds



tilings mean life to them the smuggler
the bandit the gunman the outlaw-
they are still there and a handful of men
who represent the law of a great country
fight them ofttimes hand to hand or gun
to gun

  and yet that same land last outpost
of the old pioneer days is spanned by a
thread that represents the peak of civil-
izations accomplishment for hundreds
of miles there are stretches of desert and
wilderness and mountains that are now
as they were a hundred years ago but
above them twice a day from gulf to
gulf the airplanes of the army air
service border patrol keep watchful eyes
on the tempestuous land below

  civilization has sent the fruits of its
most recent conquest to span the border
and the armys youngest branch of the
service has sent its best to man them
whether the airdromes of the patrol lie
in the heart of the big bend like marfa
and sanderson or whether they be near
douglas or el paso the airplanes and
the men who fly them have but one duty
-to watch unceasingly the seething
border country

  the mcmullen flight of the patrol
counted themselves unusually fortunate
mcmullen was a live progressive town
which was proud that the flight was lo-
cated there and showed it and in re-
cent months their pride had been justi-
fied to an unusual extent if notoriety
counted for anything the mcmullen
flight had become very prominent
largely through the instrumentality of
one lieutenant lee macdowell better
known as tex who was a young man
possessed of a boundless facility for
getting into scraps that was only ex-
ceeded by his ability to get out of them
with much credit

  this particular afternoon he was en-
gaged in one of his favorite devices
for passing leisure moments pleasur-
ably namely arousing the ire of pop
cravath adjutant of the flight

  cravath was older than the other
officers of the group by several years
and his years had not taught him to dis-

  semble wrath at the slightest provoca-
tion he would burst forth into a series
of crackling remarks and blistering ex-
pressions of a distinctly blasphemous
trend that caused his comrades to sit
back in open-mouthed admiration
withal he was much the most con-
scientious and precise member of the
group the c o included

  recently he had taken a notion to
learn something about meteorology
mcmullen was equipped with instru-
ments and a few trained enlisted men
wherewith to gain information in ad-
vance about the weather one of the
meteorological sections daily duties was
to send up large hot-air balloons which
they studied through a theodolite as they
sailed aloft thereby figuring the direc-
tion and velocity of the wind at different
altitudes by these data the flyers were
able to know the exact altitude at which
the wind would help them most or
hinder them least cravath had been
diligently studying the intricacies of
meteorology of late and today he was
going to make the balloon observations
himself

  the shack used by the weather ex-
perts faced the rear of the recreation
building tex macdowell armed with
an ordinary slingshot and some bb shot
watched the door of the shack closely
from the recreation hall the window
curtains screened him a half-dozen
airmen were with him waiting with
much anticipation

  cravath appeared at the door of the
shack tenderly holding a large red bal-
loon completely inflated tex quickly
stooped and sighted his slingshot
through a convenient knot-hole tak-
ing careful aim he let go and a satisfy-
ing smack from without was the result

  damn it yelled cravath surveying
the tattered remains in his hands with
much disgust

  he disappeared into the shack once
more for another balloon

  he reappeared shortly his new bal-
loon bobbing about as he held it with
meticulous care once again tex fired


air stories

  and was rewarded with another loud
report of bursting rubber and a truly
remarkable series of expletives from the
adjutant

  the men inside strangled their
laughter with their hands until pop had
disappeared once more into the weather
sanctum

  the next time he comes out hes
going to have a stroke chuckled
binder til bet he swears for half an
hour and never says the same tiling
twice 

  pop sure hasnt learned to guard
what his tongue saith remarked tex
keeping a wary eye on the door oppo-
site

  little pete miller suddenly exploded
without warning into a loud laugh ex-
pelling clouds of cigaret smoke which
caused him to cough and laugh at the
same time

  i was just thinking of how pop
bawled out sergeant roper the other
day when three defective balloons burst
in succession he explained

  captain kennard c o of the flight
strolled into the room

  whats the excitement he en-
quired as he surveyed the group

  sh-h-h cautioned big george hick-
man with uplifted hand

  cravath was once more emerging into
the sunlight walking as if on eggs and
holding the balloon as if it were the most
precious of possessions tex allowed
him to take three or four steps toward
the observation tower before he shot
once more

  this time the bursting balloon stung
cravaths fingers his comrades weak
with suppressed mirth listened delight-
edly while the fiery adjutant launched
into a comprehensive survey of balloons
meteorology and anything or anybody
connected with the same he soared to
truly awe-inspiring heights of verbiage

  captain kennard finally composed
himself sufficiently to ask-

 who conceived this idea-you
tex

  tex looked down from his six-foot-

  two into the twinkling eyes of the stocky

captain

  i admit it with pride he grinned
boy did you see him hop when the last
one hit him

  i heard it anyway laughed the
c o well its time for officers meet-
ing

  the little company filed out of the
room and across into the captains office
the remainder of the dozen officers who
composed the flight were awaiting them
there-all except cravath

  go to the meteorological shack and
get lieutenant cravath ordered the

c	o and the orderly departed

  w hile he was gone tex explained the
reason for the mirth of the recent ar-
rivals cravath entered in a moment
his face still red with -wrath and seated
himself behind his desk

  captain he began unceremoniously
i want to make a kick about those
damn balloons three of them-

  pie did not get any farther when
the officers recovered and cravath com-
prehended what had happened the digni-
fied adjutant decided to laugh with them
he gazed at tex lounging easily against
the wall with twinkling es belying his
contemptuous expression

  if you found time hanging heavy on
your hands tex youd play with a
rattle he observed

  macdowell was a continual puzzle to
cravath-even captain kennard some-
times wondered whether he understood
tex and the captain knew human na-
ture the tall young flyer was such a
curious combination of boyishness and
ability to take care of himself under any
circumstances or in any company that
he sometimes seemed like two separate
individuals in one

  well lets get to business and get
this thing over said the c o cravath
are there any orders to read 

  the adjutant read a couple of war
department circulars which had been
received that day and then indicated
that he was through the captain settled
back in the swivel chair behind his desk
riders of the clouds



and lit a cigaret his mouth stretched
in a broad grin that made the big scar
on his cheek wrinkle deeply as he sur-
veyed his staff of flyers and observers
he ran his hand through the short
bristly pompadour that stuck up on his
head and then shook his head sadly

  tve got bad news for you he be-
gan not so bad for you maybe as
for the boys at donovan field its
about booze

  he quickly shuffled through the
papers on his desk finally drawing out a
letter which he glanced over as if to
refresh his memory

  it seems that a few days ago a repre-
sentative of the law in san antonio act-
ing presumably at the instigation of
some san antonio reformers came out
to donovan field and raised hell with
colonel mills about the liquor being
carried from the border to donovan
field the last dance they had was
pretty well oiled with tequila aguadiente
and whisky i guess this minion of
the state likewise made some cracks
about there being some suspicion that
maybe some of the boys were carrying
opium up to make a little kale

  of course thats ridiculous perhaps
a border flyer now and then packs a
bottle in his suitcase and offers a drink
to some of his friends who are parching
up at donovan field but thats all

  a chuckle ran around the circle of
flyers

  well anyhow the captain resumed
cocking a contemplative eye at the last
smoke-ring theyre squawking about it
up around effete san antonio and
orders from headquarters are that every
ship coming in from-or back to dono-
van field from-the border will be
thoroughly searched and severe dis-
ciplinary action taken on the pilot of any
ship carrying any of the demon rum i
imagine the civilian authorities may
swoop down at any moment likewise
for a little private search

  he grinned as a thought struck him
the boys at donovan are out of
luck he remarked

  and were not going to be near as
popular as we were drawled tex the
last time i landed at donovan it looked
as if they were having an officers re-
view in my honor

  well when you and george fly up
there tomorrow youll have a chance to
see it at first hand replied the c o
his face became serious again

   all kidding aside fellows orders are
orders and well live up to them the
rest of the border had better do it too
because its a damned cinch that hell is
going to pop when they catch somebody
especially if any civilian official pokes
his nose in dont any of you get mixed
up thats all

        chapter ii
        under arrest

next morning the sun rose in a
cloudless sky giving promise of a
terrifically hot day so tex and george
hickman his observer decided to get
an early start for donovan field before
the mounting sun made the flying
bumpy consequently it was only seven-
thirty when sergeant cary chief me-
chanic of the flight started to warm up
the big four hundred and fifty horse-
power liberty motor in macdowells
dehavilnd plane

  tex who was engineer officer and
test pilot of the flight was to test a new
dehaviland at donovan field and fly
it back to mcmullen leaving the old ship
there for overhaul and repair it having
had its allotted number of hours in the
air big blondly handsome hickman
was going along just to take a look at
san antonio and see a show early as
it was pete mills and wallace had
started on the eastern morning patrol
and binder and cravath were fifty miles
on their way westward along the rio
grande

  macdowell and hickman swinging
their helmets and goggles in their hands
strolled from the mess-hall toward the


air stories

ship which had been started and was
idling gently the air was quiet for it
was too early for the gulf breeze to be
stirring the airdrome four hundred
yards square was bounded on three
sides by hangars frame barracks mess-
halls and storehouses their ship was
on the line in front of the hangars

  the roar of the motor increased as
cary slid the throttle forward a trifle
the wheels began to press against the
blocks that held them and the two me-
chanics who were holding each wing set
themselves to hold the ship little by
little the throttle crept forward under
the sergeants careful hand until the
man sitting on the tail to keep the ship
from nosing up was compelled to turn
his back and lean against the propeller
blast for a few seconds the noise of
twelve mighty cylinders firing in rotation
was almost deafening and then as
slowly as the motor had been turned on
it was cut down to idling

 tex and hickman fastened their
helmet straps and adjusted their goggles
as cary climbed out of the cockpit the
pilot adjusted his belt tried both
switches and studied air oil and tem-
perature gages briefly he turned around
and hickman nodded that he was ready
tex signalled the mechanics who
pulled the wheel blocks there being
no wind he slowly pushed the throttle
and spark ahead until both were wide
open a little pressure on the stick and
the tail came up for a hundred yards
they roared across the ground and then
the hard-packed sand dropped away be-
neath them

  tex hunched down further behind the
windshield as they circled the field to
escape the terrific pressure of air which
was the result of their whirring pro-
peller and a hundred miles an hour of
airspeed two circles of the field
brought them up to two thousand feet
and assured him that the motor was run-
ning well he banked around and
headed north for the two hundred and
fifty mile grind to donovan field

  there being no particular hurry he

followed the railroad it was thirty
miles shorter to fly an airline straight
across the mesquite but along the rail-
road there were a few fields which
might be possible landing places if the
motor cut out to the border patrol
flyer accustomed to gamble his life
against his motor as he flew for hours
over trackless mesquite it seemed very
comfortable to have any cleared places
at all below him

  it was thoroughly characteristic of
tex to take the railroad course instead
of the airline although the average per-
son who knew him would expect him to
take a chance on the shorter but more
dangerous route he had won his
reputation as the premier pilot of the
border by a succession of brilliant often
reckless flying achievements a dozen
times his fellow pilots had watched him
stall down in a dehaviland than which
there is no more ticklish or expert bit of
flying and gasped at the chance he was
taking but in doing that he was de-
pending on his ability to handle the ship

  should he take the airline to san
antonio no skill of his could save a
crackup perhaps death to both passen-
gers in the event of a forced landing
in the thick mesquite consequently
inasmuch as there was no need for
haste he did the safest thing

  tex possessed unconsciously per-
haps a great confidence in himself that
was the result of experience and self-
knowledge minus conceit nine out
of ten people who knew him only by
reputation would have rubbed their eyes
with wonder that he should take the
safest course when tex became
reckless it was a calculating reck-
lessness that depended little on the in-
fallibility of an airplane motor and
much on the flying ability of tex
macdowell

  a half-hour and the ship had climbed
gradually to five thousand feet the
edge of the mesquite wilderness a hun-
dred and fifty miles long slipped be-
hind them to the left as far as the
eye could see the scrubby forest of
riders of the clouds



grayish-green billowed away to the sky-
line the ship was slightly right-wing
heavy but nevertheless the sturdy
motor drew it through the air at a hun-
dred miles an hour even though it was
throttled down to fifteen hundred revo-
lutions a minute once in a while tex
was compelled to pump the air which
failed to hold up to three pounds but
otherwise the old ship seemed to have
escaped the effects of age

  the last fifty miles of the trip which
were over more open country were
rather bumpy as the rapidly heating
atmosphere started currents of warm
and cold air that reached even to five
thousand feet both airmen were glad
to see the level expanse of donovan
field come into view the mile-long rows
of hangars barracks and machine shops
standing out vividly white against the
green tex started to dive when he
was still ten miles from the field throt-
tling his motor to twelve hundred by
taking a long gradual dive with motor
partly on overfast cooling was pre-
vented and the sparkplugs would not
foul right to the last the great lib-
erty did its duty-every gage read cor-
rectly as the big ship shot over the
southern edge of donovan field and
the motor went full on again

  tex circled the field at five hundred
feet to look at the landing t it was
pointing southeast he sideslipped over
the hangars and with instinctive judg-
ment leveled out less than two feet above
the ground the speed dropped to sev-
enty-five then to seventy miles an hour
for just an instant the ship seemed to
hover and the pilot jerked back on the
stick the tail came down and they
landed smoothly

as they taxied to the line opposite
hangar  where visiting ships
were always taken care of the two
border pilots looked around them appre-
ciatively after the small difficult air-
drome at mcmullen it was almost im-
posing even to them to watch a dozen
ships at a time landing and taking off

all around the mile-square field about
them

  they found a niche on the line be-
tween a little s e  and a low-hung
wicked-looking le pere as they
climbed out lieutenant harrow one of
the assistant adjutants and two civilians
approached quickly they were stand-
ing beside the border ship before me-
chanics had a chance to get blocks under
the wheels tex nodded to harrow
and then shut off his gas flow after
a half-minute the motor gurgled and
spit and then the propeller gradually
stopped he snapped off the switches-
he had run the gas out to prevent back-
firing-and crawled out

  hello harrow he greeted the
donovan field man who had already
shaken hands with hickman

   lo tex just got captain ken-
nards wire that you were on the way a
few minutes ago good trip

  came by the railroad- re-
turned tex expertly rolling a cigaret
with one hand while he replaced the
makings in his pocket with the other

  meet mr snow and mr crillon-
lieutenant macdowell and lieutenant
hickman

  both the civilians who were middle-
aged men of commonplace appearance
looked at the airmen with considerable
interest

  heard a lot about you two-in fact
saw you in the movies stated the
stouter of the two who had a red face
and a jovial smile

  yes when george hung out on the
wing so we could land without a wheel
he sure made us matinee idols grinned
tex referring to an incident that had
been caught by the camera man of a
news-weekly

  well did you bring in any booze
tex inquired harrow his blue eyes
twinkling i hope you didnt because
these two chaps are from the depart-
ment of justice in san antonio

  what  liquor  asked tex in hor-
rified tones

  the stout man-crillon-looked up


air stories

at the broad-shouldered tanned pilot
apologetically mac dowells mouth
which ordinarily had a whimsically hu-
morous quirk at the comers stretched
into a grin and the crinkles around the
keen gray eyes deepened

  george are you a bootlegger he
asked

  hickman shook his head

  not enough money in it he replied
confidentially

  i dont know what got the chief
started but orders is orders and well
have to pry around a little lieutenant
said crillon

  help yourself replied tex with a
wave at the ship

  their suitcases were wired on the
wings one on each side of the fuselage

  snow who had a pair of cold blue
eyes and a cigar clamped in his mouth
immediately climbed up on the wing
for a look at the cockpits he had not
said a word thus far except to acknowl-
edge the introductions

  what are you an army sleuth
now hickman asked harrow

  representing headquarters re-
turned harrow genially get those
suitcases unwired will you sergeant

  two of the mechanics at a word
from the sergeant in charge of the han-
gar unwired the bags tex and hick-
man smoked contentedly watching the
busy field idly scouts bombers and
training-planes were all discernible land-
ing and taking off and down the line
the noise of many motors warming up
filled the air with a low drone

  the two operatives with harrow
watching them took a brief look at the
suitcases and then closed them

  guess you get a clean bill of health
lieutenant said crillon

  why the sudden access of virtue
around these parts asked tex

  harrow shrugged his shoulders

  search me

  and me added crillon this is
my first shot at it and the chief told
me nothing

  we might take this off said snow

suddenly his hands on the turtleback
which forms the top of the fuselage

  all right replied harrow

  at a word from him the mechanics
started knocking out the pins that held
the turtleback to the fuselage itself in
a moment with hickman helping them
they lifted the wood-and-linen cover
off

  well for the love of mike said
hickman in surprised tones whats
this bag doing here

  crillon and harrow suddenly seri-
ous untied a small canvas bag that was
hung from one of the top cross-braces
of the fuselage tex as surprised as
his observer watched snow untie the
string around the mouth of the bag and
turned it upside down a dozen tins
rolled out on the ground

  opium

it was a chorus-almost ludicrous in
the different gradations of surprise
and in the cases of harrow and hick-
man horror a curious swarm of me-
chanics encircled the group and a few
passing officers stopped to find out what
was the matter

  snow and crillon quickly weighted
the cans they were all heavy the
top was pried off one and the dark
sticky substance inside told its own
story with one accord everyone looked
at the two men from mcmullen tex
and george glanced at each other quick-
ly in the eyes of each was an unspoken
question-and the swiftly flashed an-
swer was satisfactory

  well ill be damned

  macdowells w-ords were slow al-
most gentle but there was a curious
cliange in his appearance he lounged
against the fuselage as easily as ever
cigaret in hand the half-mocking
twist at the comers of his mouth was
still there but the wideset gray eyes
slightly narrowed were blazing with
what seemed like the reflection of some
inner fire there was a lot of reck-
lessness-a kind of fierce joy of battle
there hickmans face was merely a
riders of the clouds



still-life illustration of horrified sur-
prise

  harrow touched the two flyers lightly
on the shoulder

  im sorry but you will consider
yourselves under arrest he said his
lined face very serious

  tex grinned although his eyes were
still shining with that savage delight in
pitting himself against he knew not
what

  dont cry about it pardner he
said slowly of course those damn
cans are news to us as well as to you
but you cant do anything else where
do we go from here

  to the old man i guess replied
harrow do you gentlemen wish to
accompany us

  crillon and snow shook their heads

  weve got no jurisdiction here
were just nosing around to help out
of course you understand that a full
report will be made and that if the civ-
ilian authorities wish to press the mat-
ter providing they are not satisfied with
the action taken by the military it will
be taken up later replied crillon

  the curious crowd of officers and
men watched harrow and the two bor-
der men start for the c os office
harrow carried the opium repacked in
the bag in some way the news had
spread ahead of them and as they trav-
ersed the wide concrete highway which
ran between the row of hangars and the
barracks and officers quarters excited
knots of officers and men met them
every few yards

  good god tex im afraid you boys
are in a mess harrow told them as
they approached headquarters

  looks that way replied george
moodily of course there is only one
explanation tex

  tex nodded harrow looked at them
questioningly

  you mean

  fitzpatrick it would have been easy
for one of his men to get in the hangar
last night and plant the stuff

  harrow nodded

  i thought as much of course we
dont know much about what is happen-
ing down there but a few seepings of
gossip about the little tiffs youve been
having with that old bird have filtered
up this way i hope you can convince
the old man tex

  im trying tex returned gently
george we sure are the prominent boys
around donovan look at that recep-
tion committee

  twenty-five or thirty officers were
grouped around headquarters building
that tex macdowell who in a few
months had become the most talked-of
pilot in the south should be caught
smuggling opium was an event not
lightly to be overlooked hickman the
texans chief aid in his most widely
known flying achievement was likewise
a famous character around donovan
although few of the donovan airmen ex-
cept the older group knew either one of
the border men

  major schaffer operations officer of
the field hurried down the walk to meet
harrow and his charges

  for the love of heaven tex what
the hell have you been doing

  carrying opium they tell me but ill
be damned if they didnt have to tell me
before i knew it grinned tex

  going in to the colonel

  yes sir replied harrow

  the tall lanky young major who had
a distinguished overseas record put his
mouth close to macdowells ears

  tex tell me straight as man to man
do you know anything about this

  tex his blazing gray eyes belying
the easy carelessness of his manner
met the majors eyes squarely

  not a damn thing major

  then you think that dave fitzpat-
rick is behind it

  i know it interjected hickman as
they mounted the steps

  the group of officers parted silently
a few who knew these two flyers spoke
to them in half-embarrassed tones all
of them saluted the major

  harrow when you see the old man


air stories

tefl him that i would like to see him on
this matter-that i have something of
importance to say concerning it said
the major in suddenly crisp phrases

  yes sir

  harrow disappeared into the adju-
tants office and in a few seconds came
to the door of his own office where he
had left the three

  the colonel wants to see you right
away he said major schaffer lie
wishes you to come in at the same time

  the four officers major schaffer in
the lead filed silently into the office of
colonel mills he was sitting at his
desk signing papers he was a stocky
gray-headed man with a strong square-
jawed countenance and keen blue eyes
that years in the philippines and the
southwest had surrounded with a mul-
titude of wrinkles

  the four came to salute which the
colonel returned negligently

  sit down gentlemen he said and
went on signing papers

  he stole frequent glimpses at mac-
dowell from under lowered lids as he
automatically spread his signature on
document after document for months
gossip from the border had indirectly
reached his ears about the man who was
now lounging easily before him shirt
open around his tanned throat and thick
brown hair tousled from the wind both
tex and hickman were oil-grimed and
dirty just as they had climbed out of
their ship they carried helmets and
goggles in their hands

  finally the colonel finished and leaned
back in his chair his eyes meeting mac-
dowells squarely for the first time
the c o lit a cigaret the while he ap-
praised the texan with puckered eyes

  all right harrow he said at length
his eyes shifting to the assistant adju-
tants face

  harrow told the story briefly and pre-
sented the bag of opium cans as evi-
dence a hum of conversation from the
veranda of the small building reached
the ears of the men in the colonels office
and two or three times the c o glanced

up irritably as soon as harrow had
finished he rung a bell and captain
peele his adjutant entered

  tell that bunch of damn gossips on
the porch to get to hell away from
here he ordered headquarters is no
officers club on this field

  the captain departed and the colonel
looked speculatively at tex and hick-
man

  you flew with the english during
the war didnt you he inquired sud-
denly

  from  on sir replied the flyer

  got three boche somebody told me
am i right 

  yes sir

  hum well what have you and your
movie partner got to say about this
opium deal it would have been bad
enough if it had been only whisky did
you people at mcmullen get the orders
from colonel feldmore about carrying
liquor 

  yes sir stated hickman and
neither macdowell nor i know any more
about how that opium got in our ship
than you do

  there was no mistaking the sincerity
of the big observers vigorous state-
ment major schaffer got the colonels
eye

  will the colonel give me permission
to say a word he asked

  go ahead i was wondering what
in hell you were horning in on this deal
for anyway commented the colonel
dryly

  the major smiled

  here is what i wanted to say sir in
a nutshell you may or may not know
that lieutenant macdowell here has
twice come up against dave fitzpatrick
anyhow you know fitzpatrick for the
most powerful unscrupulous man in the
southwest am i right

  the colonel nodded

  well for reasons dating from years
back this uncrowned king of the border
is out to get macdowell captain ken-
nard a very close friend of mine has
told me the whole story what i was
riders of the clouds



going to suggest sir was that captain
kennard be brought to donovan field
to present the case-i am sure it would
carry more weight than if tex-i should
say lieutenant macdowell-told it him-
self personally i have known these
men some time and through their c o
i know them very well i believe they
are innocent with captain kennard
to give all the dope about how fitzpat-
rick has tried to frame macdowell be-
fore i believe that we can convince you
or a court martial of their innocence

  the colonel smoked contemplatively
for a moment and then made his de-
cision

  this case is open and shut if for
no other reason than the complaints
which have come to us from san an-
tonio-rather mysterious the way they
suddenly started too-we must take
every step to apprehend and severely
punish any lawbreaker in the service
nevertheless i know fitzpatrick and i
know good men-

 he broke off for a moment his
thoughts evidently far away he threw
away his cigaret impatiently

  my mind is open on the subject ill
have captain kennard wired to fly up
here this afternoon unless the matter
is satisfactorily cleared up of course a
general court martial is inevitable as
matters stand now you must be tried
you men will consider jourselves under
arrest you will report to me at ten
oclock tomorrow morning in this office
harrow fix up quarters for them and
notify the provost marshal thats all

chapter iii
that skunk fitzpatrick

that evening obeying an order
from colonel mills through one of
his orderlies tex and hickman reported
to headquarters they found there the
colonel himself and captain kennard
who had flown in from mcmullen dur-
ing the afternoon with them was col-

onel feldmore department air service
officer he was a tall spare man of
middle age with a rough-hewn face and
a wide reputation throughout the army
he was known as one of the fairest
men in the army-but a bad hotnbre if
somebody ran foul of him and he
never set out to accomplish the complete
and lasting subjugation of a man unless
he had good reason for so doing he
knew his own mind and changed it for
neither man nor devil

  the two flyers saluted their three su-
periors and waited silently both were
now in full uniform from stock to
boots underlining the double-wing on
macdowdls blouse was a row of rib-
bons-the croix de guerre with three
palms the ribbon with a rosette repre-
senting the legion of honor and the
british d s o

  sit down gentlemen we have called
you here for a complete discussion of
the incident of this morning

  colonel mills stopped a moment as
the noise of an automobile motor stop-
ping in front of headquarters reached
his ears

  it is rapidly growing in importance
the newspapers tonight are full of it
it is something which for the good of
the service-and i hope for your own
good as well-must be plumbed to the
bottom quickly you realize of course
what a blot on the service it has become
already

  heavy steps sounded in the hall

  no never mind son ill just mosey
right in somebody said to the orderly
outside and then the door was thrown
open unceremoniously

  tex leaped to his feet as if he had
been shot

  dad how in the world-

  the gray-bearded giant in the door-
way grasped his sons hand and pumped
it enthusiastically

  just dropped in for a social call he
replied with a rumbling laugh

  his twinkling blue eyes set in a face
the color of mahogany looked the flyer
up and down alfectionately the other


air stories

four men were on their feet for some
reason none of them except hickman
appeared greatly surprised

  now what in hell have you been
up to you limb of the devil asked
mr macdowell still holding his stal-
warts sons hand

  tex was big but his father dwarfed
him he was six four as he stood and
must have weighed two hundred and
fifty pounds without being fat his
huge black sombrero was pushed back
on his head his gray suit soft white
shirt and black tie were all of conven-
tional cut although a discerning eye
might have noted that the shirt was silk
and that the suit could not have been
purchased for a cent less than a hun-
dred dollars

  limb of the devil inquired tex
with a grin ive heard other people
call you-

  dont get disrespectful warned the
old ranchman with his rumbling laugh
what these here generals could do to
you wouldnt be a patch on what your
old daddy would accomplish when he
got started

  excuse me colonel feldmore col-
onel mills captain kennard and
george hickman-my father

  mr macdowell shook hands with
them all when he got to hickman he
stopped for a moment twisting his plen-
tiful gray mustache while he took a good
look at the observer

  boy ill swear i get weak-like every
time i remember seein those movies o
you climbing around one of these damn
airplanes i dont know what this mess
o lees is that the captain wired about
but are yon in it

  george grinned

  up to the neck sir he admitted
ruefully

  tex glanced at the captain quickly
so he had got in touch with macdowell
senior had he

  well lets hear the lay demanded
the old man finally easing himself into
the biggest chair in the office

  in concise sentences olonel mills told

of what happened that morning while
he was speaking macdowell senior drew
a package of brown cigaret papers from
a capacious pocket filled one of them
with tobacco and rolled it in the twinkle
of an eye he lit it deliberately it was
almost ludicrous to see so huge a man
with so diminutive a smoke tucked un-
derneath the flawing gray mustache

   sent for you for a reason that i
will explain in a moment said cap-
tain keunard when the colonel had fin-
ished i didnt tell tex because i was
afraid hed object i did it on my own
responsibility because ive heard a lot
about roaring bill macdowell and i
knew you could help us clear your son
mr macdowell removed the som- 
brero thoughtfully and placed it on the
floor his thick iron gray hair stood
up in terrifying disorder after he had
run his fingers through it a few times
holding the stub of his cigaret between
his fingers he turned and looked at tex j
who was sitting beside him

  howabout itson he asked quietly
tex his expression thoroughly seri-
ous for once met his fathers eyes
squarely

  i saw that stuff for the first time out 
here on the field dad he replied

  of course just asked you to have
it on record

  he lifted himself to his feet the other
men watching him closely

  gentlemen the idea of lees doing
that is ridiculous on the face of it i
am not in the habit o bragging about 
how much im worth but i rise to re-
mark that i can sign a check for a lot
of money and every nickel of it is this
boys whenever he wants it he has
always had all the money he wanted and
could have had a damn sight more if he
hadnt been to independent to take it
taking all personal considerations out
of it why in hell would he bother around
with a couple of hundred dollars worth
of opium 

  the old man looked around the circle
belligerently colonel feldmore smok-
ing quietly with his chair tipped back
riders of the clouds



against the wall smiled to himself he
had heard much of roaring bill mac-
dowell

  now george hickman-

  the same thing goes for him stated
tex quickly weve turned down movie
contracts as high as a thousand dollars
a week and george of course would
have got most of it

  captain kennard nodded he had
seen the letters

  it being settled in our own minds
that these boys not being complete and
total idiots wouldnt mess around and
smuggle opium for what few dollars
they could get-

  roaring bill interrupted himself sud-
denly and looked at the two colonels
questioningly

  or maybe you dont agree speak
up colonel what do you think

  tex was on his feet the old half-
humorous half-mocking twist at the cor-
ners of his mouth

  dad youre a helluva good rancher
and cattleman but you dont know the
army if we have the colonels permis-
sion hickman and i will go

  very well assented colonel mills
stay in your quarters for a while so
that we can get you by telephone if we
need you

the two flyers saluted and went out
mr macdowell watched them his
eyes twinkling colonel feldmore nodded
slightly as if in approval at the tact dis-
played by tex in withdrawing

  now gentlemen what is your open
opinion about this deal

  the ranchman was not to be dis-
suaded from the point at issue for even
a moment for the first time colonel
feldmore joined the conversation

  it is the opinion of both mills and
myself that the boys are innocent in
fact we have stronger reasons for be-
lieving so than you will have until you
hear what captain kennard has got to
say unless your son has written you
regarding his dealings with dave fitz-
patrick

   a s-aug-

  mammy hannah has that son-of-a-
gun of a boy o mine been mixed up
with dave fitzpatrick roared the old
man in a surprised bellow

  he sure has stated the captain
and-

  excuse me captain before we tell
you mr macdowell the very peculiar
status of affairs i want to have you
thoroughly understand this no matter
how firmly we as men or army officers
believe in the innocence of those two
fellows we can not fail to press the
charges unless they are quashed by in-
controvertible evidence we can not
simply say they are innocent-that they
have been framed by a powerful enemy
the army men may have been lax about
liquor civilians in san antonio-a
few of them-have raised a howl a
couple of ministers have mentioned it
vaguely from the pulpit the evening
post in its report of our last dance
grossly exaggerated the illumination of
the participants for humorous purposes
to make things worse a complaint to
the commanding general of the depart-
ment was made and strict orders issued
finally through some pressure the de-
partment of justice horned in to help
us out they were on hand this morn-
ing when the ship from mcmullen came
in

  if that skunk dave fitzpatrick is
after lee hes got the power to start
wheels turning in san antone declared
the ranchman the wrinkles between his
eyes deepening until the bushy white
eyebrows almost met over his prominent
nose probably that bird snow was in
the plot hed bear investigating

  i dont doubt that but you see
where wre stand weve got to put up
or shut up said colonel mills taking
up the thread of his chiefs remarks
unless we can prove the innocence of
the two lieutenants its bound to be a
nasty mess

  youre right colonel now lets get
the lay on this fitzpatrick stuff twenty
years ago gentlemen when that cold
brainy crook was a cattleman i caught


air stories

him cheating in a stud-poker game at
palestine texas and drove him out of
the country since then hes become
rich i know by every means known to
man or devil ive kind of lost track
of his operations but i know for a fact
that he pulls wires down in that little
mexican joint he hangs out at that make
at least one weak-backed jelly-hearted
water-blooded nincompoop in washing-
ton jump now what about him and
the boy

  well mr macdowell began the
captain its really a case of the deeds
of the father being visited on the chil-
dren according to the dope old-timers
like sheriff bill trowbridge down at
mcmullen and ayres of the texas
rangers gave me one time when tex
was bound for el paso on a flying trip
ayres met him and gave him the news
that fitzpatrick was out to get him
just what channels the news got to
ayres through i dont know when
ayres found out that tex was the son
of roaring bill macdowell he figured
right away that fitzpatrick wanted to
get back at the man who had been-the
means of his own disgrace by trying to
run his son out of the country under a
cloud

  his actions have borne this out he
could have had tex killed a hundred
times of course by one of his gunmen
but there is nothing he has against tex
himself-there can be nothing he
tried one of his usual methods on him
in el paso-what he has done before to
men whom lip wanted to ruin three
of his men-a mexican and two others
named searles and beers-

  searles eh interrupted mac-
dowell a damn good man gone
wrong let me tell you

  well they got tex into a poker
game tex through ayres warning
suspected the lay but that infernal dis-
position of his to pit himself deliber-
ately against heavy odds for the pure
joy of taking a chance made him consent
to play he was watching closely for
crooked work and caught a switch in

the decks he got four aces pat and
figured that one of the others would have

a straight flush to beat him every-
body dropped out but him and beers
beers urged him to put in a couple of
thousand dollars worth of ious so
that he could demand payment at once
and prosecute when they werent paid

i suppose well tex took a chance tliat
beers straight flush would not lie pat-
he figured that would be too raw-
stayed in the pot and finally threw away
one of his four aces and drew two cards
thus spoiling beers draw if he had an
open end straight-flush which the two
top cards on the deck would fill-either
one of them i mean you see no one
would figure tex to do anything but
draw one or stand pat

  a roar of laughter burst from the old
ranchman

  did lee do that how much did
he win

  around twenty-five hundred i
think grinned captain kennard
ransom one of my observers was
there and helped tex gather up the
money at the point of a gun before the
three crooks could squeal you see
what fitzpatrick was probably figuring
-to get tex into debt demand full pay-
ment and perhaps through holding a
club over his head drive him into doing
something through which fitzpatrick
could drive him out of the border coun-
try and out of the army in disgrace
sort of crooked justice for what you did
to him mr macdowell

  dave sure got it plenty up around
palestine agreed macdowell great
jemimah but ill bet that two thousand
hurt the old snake worse than talcing
his right eye longs he knew who the
boy was

  the old man was still smiling delight-
edly as he digested the full perfection
of his sons achievement he looked
at colonel feldmore with twinkling
eyes

  i taught that young sprig to play the
great game of draw poker when he was
eight years old colonel but damned if i
riders of the clouds



dont believe the child is father to the
man 

  apparently hes no sucker at the
game laughed the colonel

  not by a long shot-never was de-
clared the ranchman he raised a lot of
hel when he was around the ranch but
i couldnt very well object havin been
somewhat of a poor church-member my-
self when young i reckon it taught
him something-nothing like expe-
rience

  he rolled another brown paper smoke
and his seamed and lined face gradually
became serious

  what youve told me captain is
news to me he resumed at length
speaking slowly as if carefully consider-
ing his words and in spite of the boy
havin come out on the big end of the
horn once or twice its a damn serious
thing for any man to have dave fitz-
patrick out to get him

  the three army men nodded agree-
ment

  it was easy for fitzpatrick to work
this deal too said captain kennard
by getting acquainted with some en-
listed man his own employee could easily
find out stuff and slip in the hangar at
night to plant the opium

  mr macdowell nodded

  just what has happened probably
of course everybody thats been around
texas much knows that hes in cahoots
with every bandit from villa to renta-
ria and that hes got a gang of outlaws
of every breed workin for him up and
down the border on his smuggling deals
but id give a pretty penny to know how
many prominent judges bankers and
government men are under his thumb
the old texans eyes were on the
glowing tip of his cigaret and there was
a reminiscent gleam in them as he
continued

  it worries me about the boy because
if theres any man in the world fitz-
patrick has reason to hate its me gen-
tlemen and if hes planning to get
back at me through lee its time for
the old man to get busy pronto theres

nothing too low and sneaking for fitz-
patrick and likewise nothing too bold
or bloody

  i personally knew three men-two
army officers and a customs man-who
got something on fitzpatrick and bucked
him they didnt get anywhere and
furthermore they all left the country in
disgrace

  colonel feldmore nodded agreement
with mills words

  mr macdowell got to his feet as if
he had come to a decision

  im getting to work tomorrow to try
and clear this opium deal up not only
that but to clean fitzpatrick up hes
been allowed to get away too long as it
is funny thing how those tilingsll
happen-a city will sit back and let a
gang of crooks run it for years and
never get up gumption enough to throw
em out makes me laugh to have new
york and those towns laugh at texas
difference in circumstances thats all
ive got a little influence around this
part of the country and im starting to
use it a hundred of fitzpatricks men
have been caught but never a time has
the old rattlesnake himself been burnt
now gentlemen how long are you go-
ing to give me to work on this before
the boy is court-martialed  hell i
wish hed a told me about this before 
thats the trouble with him opined
captain kennard why mr mac-
dowell that young fool actually enjoys
being in a mess if theres anything in
the world hell go miles to live through
its a scrap of any kind hes-

  chip off the old block laughed his
father never got out o hot water my-
self till i got married theres nothing
better than a good scrap but when the
boy goes up against dave fitzpatrick
its a cold deck right from the go

  i know it and ive got something to
suggest said the captain tex is our
engineer officer down at mcmullen and
it would be a good thing for him to take
the course at the mechanics school
anyway inasmuch as this happening
today shows clearly that fitzpatrick is


air stories

in deadly earnest about framing tex
why wouldnt it be a good thing to order
him up here colonel for that course
while he is awaiting trial  it would ap-
pear better in san antonio too to have
him right on the ground up here inas-
much as i think we all believe that it
was fitzpatrick who planted the whole
deal its a dead cinch that hell find
ways to stimulate a continuous and loud
bunch of protests if it appears that the
case isnt being pressed tex will be
away from the border where fitz-
patricks power is most absolute and
where he would have every opportunity
to plunge him still further into trouble
and his father here can start the wheels
turning with a free mind the idea
wont appeal to tex but damn it colo-
nel i think the world of that fellow
and i know damned well that fitz-
patrickll get him just as sure as hell un-
less we forget were army officers and
look at it like men 

  the captains plea was vehement and
sincere and both the other officers knew
the truth of his words before they
left the office that night it had been de-
cided that tex and george hickman
were to remain at donovan field under
orders and that the time of their trial
would be delayed as long as possible to
give mr macdowell a chance to use his
wide power and influence to start things
in motion to clear them from the
charges

  understand mr macdowell were
colonel mills parting words to the
texan as men we are behind you in
what you believe as army officers un-
less proof can be obtained to present to
the court-martial we must press those
charges and there isnt a chance in the
world of the two boys escaping im
afraid unless we can find something
that will convince others of what we
are already convinced of if they got
by the army court-martial you know
that a civilian jury will be waiting for
them

  i understand perfectly colonel
stated macdowell senior leave things

to me ill trim fitzpatrick again like

i did twenty years ago or my name isnt
macdowell now lets forget it

listen

  with exaggerated care he tiptoed
from one to the other whispering a few
words in each mans ear broad smiles
spread over the faces of the three as

they listened

  twenty-year-old stuff gentlemen m
he said aloud so shall we take colo-
nel mills suggestion here and adjourn
to his quarters ive still got that car
out here-its in a bag i crave to
moisten up i

        chapter iv
        trouble ahead

it was two weeks later when tex
working busily in grimy overalls
was told that major stratton com-
manding officer of the mechanics
school wanted to see him immediately
carruthers officer in charge of the
course for engineer officers brought
tex the message macdowell was hard
at work putting together the internal
workings of a tom-down liberty motor
the mechanics school believed that for
every lecture on the theory of motors
there should be many hours devoted to
getting the hands dirty and learning by
actual experiertce

  good lord carruthers have i got
to mosey down and clean up right now 
inquired tex disgustedly

  unless you want to interview the
major in that spiffy suit of coveralls
replied carruthers who was a slight
good-looking fdlow with a pair of
sparkling brown eyes and a flashing
smile that helped to make him one of
the most popular men on the field

  he had been a senior in a prominent
engineering school at the start of the
war and incidentally held one or two
new england intercollegiate records on
the track

  they may not be the glass of fash
riders of the clouds



ion agreed tex carefully wiping and
then wrapping up his tools but theyre
cool

  i dont see why theyre so stiff
with dirt you might as well be wearing
a tin suit retorted carruthers ive
got to report along with you by the
way

  its no hardship for you fashion
plates in boots and breeches now we
who labor with our hands-

  shut up and lets get started ill
take you down to the quarters on the
motorcycle so you can change

  tex locked up his tools in a chest and
then with carruthers at his side walked
down the long hangar where dozens of
students-commissioned and enlisted-
were working busily under the guidance
of instructors two lecture rooms at
the far end were filled to overflowing
with classes which were getting lecture
periods the mechanics school was the
mechanic-factory of the air service and
major stratton saw to it that produc-
tion was fast and thorough

  carruthers started the motorcycle
and tex folded up his long legs and
eased himself into the sidecar he
showed no effects in his manner or face
of the difficult two weeks that had passed
since the discovery of opium in his ship

  in the mechanics school itself after
the first day or two tex had effortlessly
established himself as a real guy his
whimsical humor lack of conceit and
above all his refusal to allow the fact
that he was in confinement for an im-
portant crime to affect either his sense
of humor or his attitude toward his
work speedily convinced the busy young
officers of the school that regardless of
the fact that he might be guilty he was
an addition to the gang he won their
money at poker flew their scout ships
as they had seldom been flown before
and refused absolutely to discuss the
charges against him in any way fur-
thermore no amount of pumping could
persuade him to launch forth into tales
of his achievements overseas or on the
border as a result the attitude of the

schools young men was expressed by
slim evans a few days after they had
all come to know the man of whom they
had heard so much

  he may be guilty or he may not
stated slim around the mess-table one
night when tex was absent and per-
sonally i dont give a damn whether he
is or not

  which attitude tex must have no-
ticed but if he did he gave no indica-
tion that he realized his peculiar position
among his brother officers right now
he was wondering whether the wheels
were beginning to move had mac-
dowell senior accomplished anything

  carruthers sat and smoked while tex
quickly bathed and dressed the young
engineer only a fair pilot himself
through lack of opportunity to make fly-
ing his chief business in the army was
secretly a profound admirer of the sea-
soned veteran wrho was one of his motor
students being of a sensitive disposi-
tion he realized better than most of the
others just how much poise and cold
nerve it took for the texan to con-
duct himself naturally and carve a
niche for himself in the mechanics
school under the circumstances jack
carruthers was for tex hook line and
sinker and as they sped toward head-
quarters for the interview with the
major he was almost hoping that it
would be of such a nature as would
give him an opportunity to demonstrate
his loyalty

  both men waited with interest for the
major to bring up the subject of the
interview for a moment however he
insisted on discussing with tex the ad-
vantages of a sideslip landing he had
seen him make a beauty that morning
and unlike most high-ranking officers
the major was a real flyer himself
which meant that he was ready to dis-
cuss flying at all times when a kindred
soul was around to discuss it with him

  finally he came to the reason for ask
ing the two men to report

  captain barrett from washington
took a ship from here to fly to the cor-


air stories

bett ranch two days ago he said we
sent old sergeant correll along with
him well the captain got lost in a
fog and landed near a town called aus-
man texas down on the gulf of mex-
ico it was muddy and he turned over
on his back broke the prop a wheel
jimmed up the rudder and various other
minor injuries the captain had to get
back to washington so he left correll
with the plane

  weve got to send down a ship with
the needed supplies and two pilots one
to fly each ship back our ofticers are
pretty busy so i figured it would help
us out if we could pull you out of
school for a week-you would just drop
down a class you see-and send you
as one of the pilots macdowell

  id sure like to go major but being
a criminal- drawled tex with a rising
inflection at the end

  the young major grinned

  i know colonel mills was a little
afraid of doing it but colonel feld-
more said he was getting fed up on all
the lambasting san antonio was giving
the air service in general and you in
particular and that i could send you
and be damned to what anybody thought
however we are going to make a con-
cession to public opinion and appoint
the other pilot-carruthers if he wants
to go-technically your guard while
youre away

  tex shook his head doubtfully

  hes so little major my god
think what a temptation id be under to
escape

  get tough with me and ill show
you threatened carruthers id sure
like to go sir he added to the major

  i thought you would-your job
doesnt give you much chance for cross-
country work and in addition your
knowledge of motors may help correll
in fixing up the ship its been out there
in the mud too long to be in good shape
he reached over his desk and handed
tex a slip of paper

  here are all the directions for find-
ing the field which correll has picked

out as suitable for you to land on its
practically next to the place where the

captain cracked up and about a mile
out of town ausman isnt on most
maps-its just a little place i guess
but a branch line of the railroad that
goes through barnes city has just re-
cently been put through according to
correll you can follow that railroad
to acacia and from there the branch
line to ausman which isnt on our maps
its right on the gulf

  when do you wish us to start sir
asked tex folding up the paper and
putting it in his pocket

  tomorrow morning johnson will
give you a ship better take a jenny
with an h motor-no use of taking
chances with one of these overbalanced
dhs on a short trip you can land at
the government field at barnes city
for gas

  the young major watched the two
flyers go out with a satisfied smile he
wondered whether tex suspected that
his co had deliberately pulled wires
to give him the trip mrs stratton was
a texas girl and familiar with what the
name macdowell had meant in texas
since old roaring bill had first become a
cattleman back in the eighties not
that mrs stratton could remember the
eighties but her father had many a tale
to tell of the old days when he and mac-
dowell senior and a few other hardy
souls had fought their way by main
strength to a commanding position in
the lone star state

  the major himself was not in charge
of the most important single activity of
the air service for nothing-he knew
men and he agreed thoroughly with his
wife that in all probability tex was a
most unfortunate victim of circum-
stances the co turned back to his
work in a righteous glow-that assign-
ment would mean something to mac-
dowell in more ways than one

 it did and in more ways than
even the major could possibly have in
mind

if youd been on the coast that year
anywhere between shanghai and the
malay states youd have heard
lurid unsavory tales anent two sol-
diers of fortune-gales and mcgill
one-time lieutenants in the american air
service it began when these two bird-
men flying a battered hydroairplane
aided in manipulating the escape of a
native prince from a vile dungeon in
the neighborhood of canton they did
it for a price of course and it was most
unfortunate that during the rescue cer-
tain well-laid plans went to pot calling
for the immediate use of automatic pis-
tols and resulting in a number of casual-
ties for the other side

  thereafter they were suspected of
various outrages ranging from theft to
kidnapping and on up to rank raw mur-

gales and mcgill free lances of
the air stamp merrily on a chinese
dragons tail-and backfire to the
siam coast

der on the yangtse two attempts were
made to blow up the plane and one
night in a black back-alley of chinkiang
mcgill carrying more liquor under his
belt than was good for any man-espe-
cially in chinkiang-got a flung knife
in the ribs and almost passed out of the
picture

  then on a hot sultry day brassy with
the glare of the equatorial sun the pop-
ulace of bangkok that maudlin wicked
colorful city looked up to see a silver-
winged monster droning down out of
the blue a vellow-robed monk in a
dug-out canoe bent on collecting alms
from the river craft looked once and
then headed for shore where he took
up a watchful position under a sacred
bo-tree sampans house-boats and
canoes scattered from the face of the




air stories

menam river and drove to hug the
protection of the wharves and the
wooded banks

  the plane circled the city its wings
flashing in the sunlight its motor roar-
ing even above the din and clamor of the
most turbulent of eastern cities then
it was over the river again and sud-
denly it slanted the motor died like
a graceful bird the plane descended
its pontoons kissed the water skimmed
along free for an instant then touched
again and threw aside ribbons of milky
foam it missed hitting a sampan by
no more than a foot passed perilously
between two anchored schooners and
glided to a stop in the lee of a dumpy
river packet

  bill gales pulled off his goggles and
turned to gjjn his youthful dare-devil
grin at his older partner

  well mike pretty nifty that land-
ing eh

  couldnt have done better myself
bill got a butt 

  sure gales passed back a packet
of cigarettes and chuckled that guy in
the sampan we almost hit has made the
shore and is still running well here
we are in bangkok just about out of
gas

  and not enough dough to get drunk
on supplemented mcgill what a
tough break 

  never mind mike well get some
somehow weve been recognized by
this time and if it comes to the worst
these officials here will supply us with
gas just to get rid of us

  ten to one theyll pitch us in jail
and stick the old boat in a museum
bill this country is getting too damned
hot for us and i dont mean the climate
either

  cheer up mike gales chuckled
i know you miss your liquor but cheer
up well anchor here and ill get a na-
tive to row me ashore

  as a matter of fact it was some lit-
tle time before gales managed to con-
vince bangkoks port dignitaries that he
had no intentions of robbing the crown

jewels murdering the king of siam
or plundering wat phra keo the tem-
ple of the emerald buddha

  but he did land a long rangy
bronzed young man with twinkling
blue eyes a slow engaging smile and
a devil-may-care tilt to his lean hard
jaw word that he had landed traveled
rapidly from mouth to mouth from
shop to shop all the way from the euro-
pean section downtown through the
reeking brothels and opium joints of the
sampaeng on northward to the boule-
vards of the nobility the houseboat-
cluttered canals buzzed writh wonder-
ment at the arrival of the winged
monster and many white men along
new road shook their heads dourly and
suspected the worst for the flyers of
fortune-gales and mcgill-had a past
crimsoned by the broad brush of gos-
sip and ill-founded rumor

   gales roving the city aimlessly wan-
dered presently into a gaming house in
the raw maw of the sampaeng he
was not there five minutes when a fat
heavy-lidded chinese approached him
and in a very direct manner asked him
how much he would charge to drop a
bomb on a certain gaming house at the
other end of the district

  gales laughed his eyes twinkled
merrily he said

  youve been misinformed my friend
we dont go in for that sort of stuff
sorry

  he wandered out of the dive wreaved
his way through the crooked evil streets
and before dusk settled he had turned
down three similar offers when he
returned to the wraterfront he found
mcgill pacing up and down a rickety
wharf in sight of the plane

  no luck mike he greeted it
seems all these birds go in for nothing
short of murder

  mcgill who was short and spare
and nervously alert with keen little eyes
stopped his pacing and jammed his
hands to his hips

  bill he said you should have
hung around dammit about an hour
flyers of fortune



after you left a stranger came down to
the wharf here and motioned me to
come ashore maybe weve got a job
gales snapped a match to a cigarette
and clipped

  shoot my boy

  sure a white man bill tall and
skinny and not so healthy-looking what
i mean but he must have dough all
right looks and speaks that way
mike get to the point

  gimme time heres the idea
were to take him in our bus and head
for the gulf of siam and look for a
ship called the bangkok belle which is
bound for saigon all right were to
land on the water near the ship and
make signs that we want her to pick up
our passenger we can say hes sick
or something

  what else

  thats all so far as details are con-
cerned he wont tell any more well
what the hell who cares theres a
thousand dollars in it with that money
we can stock up on provisions and fuel
later on and run arms from singapore
to the insurgent tribes in the celebes
where is this angel asked gales
interested

  be here at five oclock told him
to i said everything would be o k
with me but id have to speak to you
too

  o k by me chuckled gales blow-
ing smoke through his nostrils well
shove off at dawn he pays in ad-
vance and we load our tanks this eve-
ning

  at precisely five oclock the slim well-
dressed stranger arrived at the wharf
he was in his forties perhaps a sallow
bony man with large pale eyes and a
bad set of nerves

  so you are mr gales he smiled
wanly at the younger of the two part-
ners

  yes im gales well be very glad
to fly you

  call me-well smith what does
it matter

good as any chuckled gales lightly

all right mr smith tomorrow at
daybreak of course the payment in
advance you know

  to be sure agreed smith and
turned away to cough brokenly if
youll come to my hotel i shall be glad
to settle the matter he sighed and
we must get away as soon as possible
it is very very urgent i assure you
someone    well to my hotel
then he ended

gales and mcgill worked most of
the night on their plane they
loaded the gasoline tanks to capacity
put in fresh motor oil and time and
again drew a wondering crowd when
they roared and tested their engine
when they both agreed that the motor
was in perfect shape mcgill perched
on the edge of the forward cockpit and
rubbed his grimy face with a grimy
hand

  bill he said i think ill just
drop ashore for a little while and tuck
a few drinks away

  go to it partner but dont get lost
was the hearty rejoinder

  so mcgill set out to tuck away a few
drinks how many drinks he did tuck
away remains matter for conjecture
but he returned to the wharf well after
midnight singing a bawdy song and
steering a wobbly course he refused
the offer of a sampan fell overboard
and decided to swim out to the plane
gales hauled him out of the river piled
him into the rear cockpit and left him
to sleep it off at daybreak mcgill
was perfectly sober and primed for
action

  i feel like a new man he explained
chafing his hands gingerly i needed
that honest bill you can get some
good liquor in this here burg

  ready for anything eh mike
grinned gales

  ready for anything bill

  both partners were in fine spirits
when the man called smith joined
them gales was enthusiastic eager to
be off and his boyish reckless grin was


air stories

contagious mcgill was alert crawling
around the plane giving a final and
thorough inspection then smith was
helped into one of gales spare flying
outfits arid stowed in the front cock-
pit which he was to share with mcgill

  it is pretty safe to say that no one
in bangkok expected them to leave so
suddenly hence there was not much
of a crowd to witness their departure
the roar of the engine did draw a few
however and more came running down
to the wharves

  hooded and goggled gales sat in the
after cockpit at the controls a duplicate
set of which was likewise in the front
cockpit he smiled to himself as his
eyes roamed over the instrument board
and the engine thundered he saw mc-
gill turn and arch inquisitive eyebrows
then pull on his goggles gales grinned
back and nodded

  he was happy eager tingling all
over the thrill of the game never de-
serted him he was a natural flyer
and fear in the air was something he
did not know as his plane began to
slide over the surface of the water gath-
ering speed he turned his head to watch
the ctiy of bangkok sweep by he
waved joyously to the watchers on the
shore

  then he was in the air driving for
altitude soon the city of domes and
spires and dank canals was below and
behind ahead of him stretched the
jungle and the menam river winding
toward the gulf of siam the wind
hummed by his ears twanged and rat-
tled in the struts smith had said that
they should sight the bangkok belle in
the vicinity of cambodia point that
would be four hundred-odd miles from
bangkok and about five hours of flying

  when gales altimeter registered
three-thousand feet he rattled the con-
trols and saw mcgill lean forward to
take over the flying then he removed
his hands from the joy-stick and his
feet from the rudder bar and doubled
in the cockpit to light a cigarette

  mcgill took the boat up another thou-

sand feet and for the sake of variety
volplaned banked sharply and then

zoomed up to six thousand feet when
he shoved the control stick forward al-
most to the instrument board and
leveled the planes flight he looked
around at gales and grinned gales blew
smoke through his nostrils and grinned
back smith was white-faced and silent

  neither of the birdmeu had pressed
smith for other details than he had
freely given in fact they had not
even speculated between themselves as
to the object of the strangers mission
they were well used to mysteries they
were being paid to fly smith over the
gulf of siam locate the bangkok belle
and get him on board right there their
services were to end

  it looked easy nothing to it smith
certainly wanted to get aboard the ship
pretty badly to pay their price well
that was his business and it was theirs
to fly him there after that-singa-
pore and a fling at gun-smuggling

  mcgill shook the controls and gales
took over the flying dropping to three
thousand feet and passing over a
freighter that was plowing sluggishly
through the waters of the broad gulf
directly ahead of him was the newly
risen sun he dropped lower way
down to five hundred feet on down to
three hundred and still lower until he
was fairly skimming along the wave
crests

  mcgill turned and shook his head
and pointed his finger upward gales
grinned his reckless grin banked and
zoomed he drove up toward the
clouds-up-up-and still up to ten and
then twelve thousand feet and beyond
then he volplaned to five thousand feet
and drove on at an even keel chuckling
to himself

  it was a few minutes later that he
noticed smith rising in the forward
cockpit he saw mcgill yank him back
into the seat and then he saw smith
writhing in what appeared to be noth-
ing less than agony mcgill had
flyers of fortune



twisted and after throwing a puzzled
glance at gales put an arm about smith
and shouted something near his ear
then suddenly smith was quiet

  a moment later mcgill his face
twisted in a grimace turned and tried
to say something to gales gales
throttled down and leaned forward
cocking an ear

  cripes bill mcgill was yelling
hes dead

  gales was abruptly serious he was
losing altitude and soared up to eight
thousand feet before he throttled down
and again leaned forward

  yeah shouted mcgill guess his
heart was bum bill just before he
passed out    shoved this in my
hand

  gales reached out and received a
small square of cardboard about the
size of a poker card one look revealed
that it was the photograph of a young
woman-a dark-haired dark-eyed beau-
tiful young woman

  what the hell he exclaimed under
his breath

  he bent a puzzled quizzical glance
on mcgill and mcgill shrugged his own
puzzlement and spat disconsolately over-
side gales shook the controls and
mcgill handled the flying feeling not
so almighty comfortable with a dead
man beside him

  gales looked at the photograph again
wondering what smiths motive had
been in thrusting the picture into
mcgills hand this was something
they had not bargained for yet gales
was well used to meeting the unex-
pected you get that way after youve
flown for ten years he leaned for-
ward and tapped his partner on the
head mcgill twisted around and
throttled down to listen

  keep heading for cambodia point
gales shouted see if we can pick up
the bangkok belle ive got an idea

  mcgill who had become used to re-
lying on gales ideas nodded and
climbed another thousand feet they
were heading southeast down the coast

of cambodia point samit was on their
left and koh rong lay ahead below
them creamed the wraters of the gulf
and a barkentine was beating down the
wind

  clouds were gathering in the east and
trooping across the face of the sun and
huge rollers were breaking on the jungle
shore far below off phu quog island
gales who was at the controls sighting
a steamer bore down and shot close by
with his binoculars pressed to his eyes
he could see an officer on the bridge
wave it was not the bangkok belle
however and gales zoomed and soon
was tearing along at eight thousand
feet

  mcgill turned and swung a sugges-
tive arm toward the dull clouds that
were rolling out of the east gales
nodded the sun was obscured and the
waters below were being piled high
the plane was driving into strong head-
winds high over rach gia bay twice
more gales flew low to peer at outward-
bound ships but neither of them was
the bangkok belle

  it was off obi island that he sighted
a small vessel belching forth black
clouds of smoke from a single funnel
and heading northward on a heaving
foam-mottled sea he indicated it to
his partner who was at the controls and
mcgill swooped down and roared by in
the lee of the rakish yacht while gales
peered hard through his binoculars
then mcgill zoomed for altitude and
throttled down at five thousand feet to
shoot gales an inquiring glance

   its it shouted gales

   but hell bill roared back mcgill
we cant land in a sea like that

  know we cant say mike search
smiths pockets and see what you can
find

  mcgill nodded and gales took over
the flying circling high above the
bangkok belle in a few minutes
mcgill thrust a handful of odds and
ends back to gales and indicated that
he would handle the plane gales re-
leased the controls and examined smiths


air stories

belongings for one thing he discov-
ered that smiths real name was john
t warren a member of a singapore
club also there was a packet of blank
checks bearing the crest of a singapore
bank there were a few personal let-
ters from friends in yokohama and
some baggage stubs but nothing that
might reveal the mans business or
mission

  gales leaned forward and mcgill
looking around quieted the engine

  mike yelled gales im going to
jump with the parachute and have that
yacht pick me up meet me in saigon

  whats the idea bill

  cant explain all now trumpeted
gales

  that was all the explanation neces-
sary between these two birdmen

  gales began stuffing warrens papers
into an oiled waterproof pouch along
with an automatic pistol some money
and the photograph his parachute of
course was already strapped on but he
removed it temporarily so that he might
wriggle out of his flying suit also he
removed his leather boots then he re-
placed the parachute fastened the water-
proof pouch to his belt and touched
mcgill on the head motioning that he
was ready to make the drop

  mcgill nodded took a look at the
yacht and then shot off to the eastward
so that gales when he jumped would
get the wind drift and be carried toward
the lee of the yacht

  gales climbed out of the cockpit and
crawled out over the left wing mcgill
was watching him out of the corner of
his eye gales turned the wind drum-
ming in his ears and clattering his
clothes he waved a hand and grinned
recklessly mcgill waved back and
grinned too these men had long ago
learned to cover their inner emotions
with a brazen hard-boiled grin

  then - suddenly - gales was off
dropping plummet-like a small bit of
white ballooned out and an instant later
the big parachute sprang open with a
boom

  mcgill was circling the yacht again
and watching the descent of his partner
he grinned and spat sharply and
climbed high up into the cloudy windy

sky

  gales swung pendulum-like as he
drifted down toward the creaming
water he kept up this motion swing-
ing his body back and forth so that when
lie landed the spread of the parachute
would not envelop him he struck well
off the lee bow of the yacht and fought
clear of the parachute unfastening the
straps with one hand while he swam
with the other

  free he began swimming in a world
of flying sea-spray and vaguely was
aware that the yacht had altered her
course and was bearing down to pick
him up two seaman were standing in
the lee bow-malays they were scantily
clad the yacht drew closer and one of
the malays braced himself to heave a
line then the line snaked out and
gales grabbed at it caught it in one
hand and hung on grimly

  the first thing he did when he was
hauled on deck was to look up and wave
toward mcgill who was still circling
the craft then the plane spiraled
downward well astern of the yacht
straightened out and roared by mcgill
flung up an arm as he passed and then
zoomed away heading north

  a moment later gales was confronted
by a short stocky blowzy-faced man
who wore the braid of rank

  well droned the captain whats
the bloomin idea of leavin a perfectly
good plane an makin us pick you up

  just got tired of the air captain
grinned gales wringing out his wet
shirt sorry if ive taken you out of
your way but ill pay my passage to
wherever youre going

  this mister replied the captain is
not a passenger ship its a private
yacht

  at this point a tall beady-eyed man
dressed in spotless whites and smoking
a long mellow cigar strolled down the
deck and joined the skipper
flyers of fortune



  hello he said without smiling
you fellows will try stunts in the most
unseemly places what do you want
just passage to wherever youre go-
ing replied gales ill pay you
ive been intending to drop in at
saigon

  suits me nodded gales id like
to go into the engine room if you dont
mind and dry up

  the owner of the bangkok belle eyed
him stonily he said

  you puzzle me really now why
did you drop from that plane and have
us pick you up

  gales chuckled

  i just couldnt get along with the
pilot he insisted on heading for the
philippines and i wanted to hit the
coast i took a chance and dropped
thinking you might be able to laud me
whats your name

  gales

  the mans lips tightened

  ive heard of you and your partner
mcgill well gales i dont like your
story my name is halsey and this is
my yacht as you know you will have
to undergo a search captain please
he said to the blowzy-faced man you
know there are two gunboats hunting
this man

 gales stepped back his hands
knotting the captain advanced toward
him and two seamen closed in behind
him recklessness was ingrained in
gales no conservative man would
have dropped from a plane in order to
be picked up by a yacht  the supposi-
tion that he might find thereon some clue
concerning the photograph of a strange
girl

  even now he made a reckless move
he dodged sidewise leaped across the
deck and sped aft on the weather side
tearing open the waterproof pouch as he
ran from it he yanked his pistol spun
sharply hard by the saloon wall and
faced the two malay seamen who had
chased him from forward the captain
came lumbering after them and halsey
was close behind the captain all of them

brought up short when they saw the

pistol in gales hand

  you put away that damned gun
snapped halsey dark with rage

  you come forward flung back
gales snappy mister

  halsey advanced biting his lips

  now clipped gales move fast
lead to your room my gun will be
in your back the first man makes a
move ill riddle you more with your
hands up

  halsey muttered an oath behind
clenched teeth and entered the saloon
with gales close beside him quickly
gales turned the lock in the saloon door
he prodded halsey and the latter led
the way through a carpeted corridor and
paused before a door at the end here
he half-turned black anger in his eyes

  youll regret this he choked

  open that door-fast clipped gales
and jabbed the muzzle of his gun so
sharply into halseys ribs that the man
grunted

  but he drew some keys from his
pocket inserted one in the lock turned
it and pushed open the door gales
shoved him in not too gently pulled the
keys from the lock entered quickly and
kicking shut the door snapped the lock
from the inside

  then he saw a girl crouching in one
corner of the elaborately appointed
room and he was instantly aware that
she was the original of the one on the
photograph to her he said

  draw the curtains on the ports-
quick

  for a moment she stood petrified
surprise and anguish storming in her
eyes then with a catch in her breath
she hurried to draw the curtains on the
ports of the three rooms that constituted
the quarters

  now went on gales run through
his pockets and see if theres a gun

  she did this nervously but found no
weapon

  all right nodded gales then to
halsey you sit down and see if we
can get this straight
	air stories

  halsey dropped into a wicker easy
chair the girl sat down on a plush settee
built in against the starboard bulkhead
and gales his clothes still dripping
stood in the center of the room he
bent his gaze on the girl and asked
what relation are you to john t
warren

   she started forward her eyes dilating
i- am his daughter she whis-
pered hoarsely

  gales bit his lip what he had to say
would hurt hut this was no time to beat
about the bush

  miss warren he went on your
father hired my plane in bangkok my
partner and i were to fly him over the
gulf and put him aboard this yacht
that is all the information he gave us
he paused steeling himself when we
were two hours in the air your father
died-possibly of heart failure

  a low moan escaped her lips and she
wilted covering her face with her hands

  brace up gales told her its
hard but youve got to brace up be-
fore he died your father pressed a photo-
graph of you in my partners hand it
was the only clue i had a hunch that
he and the yacht and you were some-
how related i carried on where he left
off now what can i do

  she uncovered her face and sat erect
with a brave effort

  i-i dont see how you can do any-
thing ive been literally a prisoner
aboard this yacht since it left saigon
just before sailing time i know my
father was on board and in his state-
room that night he was drugged and
put off on the menam river in a
sampan both of us had considered
this man-she nodded toward halsey-
a friend and had accepted his offer of
a passage to saigon but- she broke
off in a sob

   i see nodded gales a little bitterly
he turned to halsey so thats your
game eh

  halsey scowled

  what about it what can you do
  gales heard feet tramping about the

deck and excited voices and hands
knocking at the ports true what
could he do the outlook was indeed
anything but cheerful here he was
playing a lone hand against overwhelm-
ing odds his first move had been suc-
cessful but luck had been with him
still there was a chance 

  he rememlered that halsey had said
two gunboats were scouring the coast
for him probably french gunboats
indeed as mcgill had said in bangkok
the country was getting hot for them-
too hot if the french got their hands
on him gales realized that they would
frame up something and no doubt give
him a taste of a colonial prison

  he was in a tight predicament here
was a girl in danger she meant noth-
ing to him in a personal way he had
no amorous designs on her nor intended
to have any yet she was a woman in
jeopardy and the old protective in-
stinct was strong within the reckless
devil-may-care heart of gales he would
try his best to save her as for himself
hed take a long chance and face a prison
sentence

  halsey he said im in a pinch and
it isnt going to take much for me
to blow your brains out if you dont
move the way i tell you to get that
and listen you write out a message
to your wireless operator and explain
that you wrote it by degrees while i
wasnt looking all right now tell
him to get in communication with one
or the other of these gunboats and tell
him to make it plain in the communica-
tion that youve got on board bill gales
the well-known cut-throat of the china
coast watch how fast theyll get here

  halsey frowned and shook his head

  get started warned gales and
there was an edge on his voice now
write that message or as sure im
headed for jail ill kill you

  the girl shrank back in awe possibly
she too had heard of gales and mcgill
and was a little frightened

  slowly halsey rose and crossed to
the bamboo table he sat down picked
flyers of fortune



up a pen reluctantly wrote on a wireless
blank as gales directed

  and add pursued gales that your
men aboard should quiet down and stop
breaking up the doors

  when the entire message was written
gales picked it up scanned it quickly
and slid it under the door leading into
the corridor then he helped himself
to a cigarette from a humidor on the
table and blew smoke streams through
his nostrils

  a few minutes later there was a rush
outside the door but it suddenly
calmed down and a moment later gales
heard receding footsteps they had no
doubt found the message

  you are doing this for me came
the girls voice tenderly

  the old sparkle came back to gales
eyes his weather-bronzed face crinkled
in a broad boyish grin

  its the only way he said lightly
rocking on his feet

  the girl fell to sobbing again and
half-reclined on the settee her own
predicament the death of her father
was certainly enough to wilt anybody

  gales sat down facing halsey

  well both wait now till the french
navy arrives he chuckled your men
on deck are probably having a great
laugh over the fact that my doom is
impending

  you damned meddler ground out
halsey ill try my best to see you
stuffed in the lousiest prison imagin-
able

  pretty sore arent you we both
lose halsey weve both played games
though youll have to admit that my
game calls for guts while yours   
ho he ended derisively

  thus they sat facing each other while
the hours dragged by the sea grew
calm in late afternoon as they could
determine by the even motion of the
yacht and needles of sunlight pierced
the curtains over the ports it was hot
and stuffy in the rooms but gales re-
fused to open a single port

  presently the girl rose from the set-

lee brushing a hand across her fore-
head and started for the water-cooler
which stood in the opposite comer she
reeled however before she reached it
and gales instinctively started to catch
her

  halsey every nerve tense saw his
opportunity and catapulted from his
chair the girl caught her balance but
her position prevented gales from
bringing his gun into action halsey
was upon him with the agility of a
cat catching his gun-hand and swing-
ing it aloft and bearing gales back
across the room in a mad rush

  gales stopped short against the for-
ward bulkhead gritted his teeth and
swung away in close grips they spun
across the room fell over a chair and
crashed down to the floor gales gun
flew from his hand and slid across
the floor  the girl still seeming on
the verge of a collapse tottered toward
it and picked it up

  the two men scrambled to their feet
and began lambasting each other at
close quarters gales was the quicker at
this game and in short time he had
halsey staggering blindly the owner
of the yacht fell away breathing thick-
ly running perspiration his hand
closed over a whisky bottle on the
table and in desperation he hurled it
gales ducked but it caught him a
glancing blow over the left ear and
staggered him halsey cackled gloat-
ingly and started for him but the girl
flashed 

  dont ill shoot

  he sagged to a standstill his face
twisted in chagrin

  gales swung toward the girl and
hastily relieved her of the gun

  if theres any killing he said let
me then to halsey now sit down
you swine

  halsey dropped limply into a chair
and gales sat down on the settee the
girl brought him a drink and said

  it was all my fault i shouldnt
have staggered like that but i was a
little faint-from the-strain
  

air stories



  i understand gales smiled

  night wore on gales snapped on
a single electric light and then returned
to the settee

  it must have been about eight oclock
when the three in the room heard a
low drone from somewhere in the dark-
ness then there was a roar increasing
with the seconds passing close at hand
and then diminishing a few minutes
later it grew again then ceased sud-
denly the engines of the yacht re-
duced speed

  five minutes later there were foot-
steps in the corridor then the
captains voice

  theres a french naval flyer here
a capn de armand with orders from
the saigon base t take off william
gales they shot down his partner
mcgill off cape st jacques

  poor old mike muttered gales
grimly then he stiffened and his
hand tightened on his automatic miss
warren he said youll walk out and
go aboard the french plane no argu-
ment please get ready he turned
to halsey ill keep my gun on you
for three minutes and then walk out
to give myself up

  he gave the keys to the girl and
with a catch in her throat she went
to the door and opened it halsey
was standing now and gales was direct-
ly behind him with his gun against the
mans back the captain of the yacht
started to enter but gales said

  not yet stay where you arc

  the girl passed out unmolested

  three minutes later gales lowered his
gun

  all right halsey perhaps youd
care to see me go aboard the french-
man

  with that he strode out on deck
and halsey followed

  in the lee of the yacht a big french
seaplane was rising and falling with
the gentle motion of the calm sea a
machine gun bristled under the white
moonlight

  ah v called a voice you have
heem ouit be sure he have no gun
so and ze mamzelle i am as-
toneesh

  gales strode to the rail and with a
hard little chuckle dropped his gun
overside

  well halsey the games up with-
out my partner no use

  he went down the companion ladder
stepped to the wing of the big sea-
plane and crossed to the front cockpit
he dropped in it beside the girl

  then the plane was off into the
night skimming along the moonlit
water and finally lifting its nose and
rising into the air the big motor
roared and the plane zoomed and
climbed up toward the pale clouds
then it was suddenly throttled
down

  say bill sounded a voice in gales
ear didnt i act like a frenchman all
right

  gales spun around and looked into
the grinning face of mcgill

  mike he exclaimed what the
devil are you doing in this official
plane 

  i was shot down off cape st
jacques by this same plane  started
swimming and the frenchman-de
armand-picked me up say they
were after us strong well i got in
a tussle with him it was him or me
and i did him in he had orders to
get us started from saigon on a
wireless tip that you were aboard the
bangkok belle had the wire on him
he was fairly roaring the information
smith went down with our poor old
boat im heading for british north
borneo all right

  good as any shouted back gales
well see the lady aboard a ship at
saudakan

  and then what bellowed mcgill

  who knows shouted gales grin-
ning

  and mcgill boomed

  what the hell
as he sat on the steps of the recre-
ation house lieutenant farry
fareton gripped the imaginary
stick of an imaginary dehaviland
and rushed to the climax of his narra-
tive

  then i saw it wasnt a bird either
it was a kite more than a thousand
feet up but down where the san angela
patrol would miss it on the end of the
tail was swinging a little box i sus-
pected right away the box was full of
cocaine but i was thinking then about
the old air hack i was driving

  straight ahead and close i saw a
long thin flash reflection of the sun
and i knew the kite was being flown on
a steel wire gosh if i buzzed into
that wire-sing-it would maybe split

   a s-aug-

swiftly in the wake of a joke with
a startling climax on the brink of

the propeller or at least upset the con-
trol connections quick as lightning i
zoomed over it with the propeller miss-
ing the wire by inches and when i
stalled into the field here that funny
kite was hanging onto the under-
carriage where itd got tangled like id
wanted id thought i ought to bring it
along you see after that it wasnt
anything for the cap to figure out
where and how the smugglers had been
getting their cocaine across the rio
grande-

  a snore interrupted other flyers on
the rec building steps likewise mem-
bers of the camilla flight of the united
states army air service were catching
after-lunch naps faretons recital was
on for the twentieth time and they

knew it by heart the event itself in

fact was not yet months old from the
mouth of one porky stevens issued a
yawn

  and to prove it fareton hurried
on ill go get-

  throttle her stevens bark halted
faretons stride away stay where
you are farry i swear i never knew
another man like you with a past com-
posed one hundred per cent of narrow
escapes who takes along with him
everywhere he goes a boxful of souve-
nirs from each and every one of said
narrow escapes just to prove he had
em youre a museum all in yourself
and its just my luck that i cant sleep
through your chatter like the other boys
do on account of my damn insomnia

  ive got to get the old stories off my
chest fareton excused himself calmly
sitting again because ive got new
ones coming along all the time hello
he exclaimed hope nothings wrong
with the morning patrol

  across the way the radio sergeant
had burst out of the shack and run
quickly toward headquarters building
at the door he met captain horder and
rattled out his message for a moment
the two men talked fast then the cap-
tain hurried out

  on the field a reassembled d h had
been warmed up for a test by the me-
chanics and several flying shavetails
were about the captain spoke briskly
to them they began to move ex-
citedly

  thats no check ride fareton de-
clared to stevens come along
porky

  the pair hastened toward the ship
its propeller was already spinning the
four-hundred-horsepower engine roar-
ing the plane taxied off inclined over
the fence and deadheaded east the
sting of flying grit still on his face
fareton turned to captain horder

  trouble sir

  somethings gone wrong with mc-
keever and thompson on the silver
lode patrol the captain answered

reports have been coming in regularly
until the last one a moment ago the
last report said that a strange plane had
come out of a cloudbank mexico-ward
the plane ojened fire on them-

  opened fire

  -opened fire with a machine gun-

  machine gunf

  -and the message stopped there
the rest well know when clark and
johnson get back captain horder
went on his face pasty theyve gone
to hunt for mckeever and thompson
in the mesquite

  as the captain strode away fareton
and stevens exchanged dazed glances

  porky this is  not  any
more and this is the rio grande terri-
tory not the argonne-

  i dont get it i stevens cut in i
havent even thought of a machine gun
for moren five years lord i hope
theres a mistake and the boys get back
safe

  statistics with which flying service
men are familiar say that every eighth
man in the service is killed every year
the government insurance bureau is not
instituted for no purpose the border
patrol understand that to the dangers
of the sky their nerves are immune
until the eighth man leaves his crate and
keeps on arching straight into the stars
forever then emotional and alcoholic
orgies come

  fareton and stevens tramped back
toward the rec house silently until
fareton spoke

  it reminds me porky did i ever
tell you about the time i glided down in
no mans land forced down and saw
a boche coming straight at me with his
hog-sticker all honed and stropped  all
i had was one hand grenade id picked
off a buddy who didnt have any fur-
ther use for it and in the excitement i
forgot to bite the plug off there it
went sailing straight at that boche just
the same

  all he had to do was catch it and
toss it back right and id have blown
away on the breeze my subconscious
patrols of peril



mind must have been working however
because that grenade happened to hit
the boche right between the eyes and
down he went-to stay i saw to it
that was a close shave it happens
ive got that grenade yet i saved it
ill go get it and show-

  dont do it stevens roared just
try to show it to me and ill use it
proper-at you

  whats the matter with you lately
porky fareton came back you act
as though youd been looping on a full
stomach

  the question touched stevens depths
the change which blended through him
was profound the eyes he turned up
at fareton were sad

  you and me we understand each
other he admitted we both have
felt the same ever since pretty lieu-
tenant twombly was assigned to the
flight two months ago-except that i
feel worse than you do at least julie
had you up to tea once

  just once fareton nodded and
twombly has tea with her every day in
the week

  i havent never been at all porky
repeated and ive got no prospects
either ive got sense enough to know
i havent any chance with her and
anyway i promised minnie back in
tulsa that id marry her i guess i
just naturally hate to see a ladys man
like twombly get away with all his
smooth stuff

  my hopes are dying fast fareton
observed but fighting for life speak
of the devil and also of angels-

  the sleek official touring-car eased to
a stop before headquarters building
under the guidance of miss juliet i-ior-
der the captains daughter at once a
uniformed man sped across the space
from the rec building and received a
cordial greeting from the girl fareton
and stevens looked away their eyes
smarting with the sight but they heard
the girl say

  im sorry we cant have tea together
today lieutenant twombly-

  fareton grinned in spite of himself

and stevens audibly giggled

  -but if youll come up at six for
dinner we can spend the evening to-
gether instead

  fareton and stevens cursed softly
oh good afternoon lieutenant
fareton

  fareton whirled his face aglow
afternoon miss juliet well well
ive been wondering where youve been
keeping yourself i used to see you
come down to bring the captain home
around four or five in the afternoon
but i notice lately the captains been
going home alone and-

  fareton realized that he had stumbled
into a conversational bog and hastily
strove to extricate himself

  i-i was just telling my friend
porky stevens about the time back in
 when a boche-

  oh yes said the girl sweetly im
sure he was interested ill see you at
six then lieutenant twombly

  fareton came away dazedly as
stevens pulled his arm stevens ex-
ploded

  you big fool thats what queered
you with her-your chatter do you
think a girl invites a man to tea to hear
terrible stories of how he rounded up a
bandit gang with a nigger-shooter-and
have him show her the very pea he did
it with  nix 

  i guess i cant help it porky fare-
ton sighed

  and tonight its dinner for that
slick twombly curse the day that
brought him to the flight i wish i
could-i wish i could- stevens
paused meditating sometimes i think
id-

  abruptly he turned and walked away
leaving fareton puzzled

the exhaust of a powerful lincoln
motor had been beating through the
air more loudly with each passing sec-
ond now the plane stalled into the
field from due east it taxied to a stop
while the mechanics mobbed around it


air stories

captain horder hurried out of head-
quarters and close behind followed
warren the flight surgeon

  the two men in the dh who had
been searching the mesquite for mc-
keever and thompson did not at once
jump out they had burdens to lower
others reached up to assist stretchers
were brought and sheet-covered two
bodies carried away fareton sidled
close while clark and johnson reported
to the captain

  the dh they took out on jatrol
this morning is a wreck sir we found
it in the mesquite in pieces we looked
at the motor the cylinders are cracked
by steel-jacketed bullets we found one
inside there are twenty-odd bullet
holes through the fuselage sir mc-
keever and thompson-by some mira-
cle captain there was something of
them to bring back riddled sir-
riddled

  the captain strode away his face
beet-red fareton whirled and with the
others pushed questions at the two
scouts porky stevens and the immacu-
late twombly joined the circle together
theories grew

  theres only one explanation for it
fareton asserted its been only a few
weeks since the cocaine smugglers were
rounded up and we know we didnt get
them all it looked like a family affair
that smuggling and family affairs in
mexico get damn serious the velen-
zos are hot-blooded anyway now that
the old man is in the pen one of his
sons might be gunning for us out of
sheer revenge ever hear of a ven-
detta-

  against the whole border patrol
twombly asked skeptically

  certainly when mexicans hate i
tell you they hate whats left of that
little crowd hates us for breaking up
the dope ring why shouldnt the
smugglers be addicts themselves hate
dope tequila-somebody crazy enough
to unlimber a machine gun at us-and
there you are

  it sounds im-

  fareton sliced into twomblys com-
ment does it well how do you
explain it with help from all the tea
youve drunk recently you ought to get
up a nice lavender-scented theory about
it

  fists would have flown at that mo-
ment had not timely interruption taken
away the possibility

  the buzzing of a motor was again
disturbing the air all eyes turned up-
ward in the direction of the approach-
ing craft it was smaller than a de-
haviland it was not preparing to stall
into the field but coming down with
motor roaring in a full power drive its
nose was pointed straight at the group
on the field

  thats not a service plane it hasnt
the markings

  it looks like-my god above
faretons voice shouted the warning
run

  the plane was close now and fare-
tons startled eyes had seen a mechani-
cal device mounted in the rear cock-pit
then a helmeted and goggled head had
risen and swung around straight at
them was the bore of a machine-gun

  like frightened chickens below a
swooping hawk the men on the ground
scattered in comparison with the
dynamic sweep of the plane their move-
ments were far too slow

  pr-r-r-r-r pr-r-r-r-r

  the machine-gun spat fiery death out
at them

  window-panes shattered bullets
planked through the corrugated tin
roofs of the hangars little spurts of
dust jumped up from the ground in
even rows

  and men fell

   pr-r-r-r- r-r-r-r-r 

  instantly the unknown plane zoomed
up climbing again into the blue at a
steep angle for a moment more it
sprayed the ground with deadly slugs
then the sputter stopped with in-
credible rapidity the plane receded

  on the ground three men lay still
two others were writhing in agony a
patrols of peril



few muffled curses were audible in the
tense silence one of those only
wounded waved wildly as those unhurt
rushed instinctively toward them and
shouted

  get that crate

  then came the squeak and rumble of
hangar doors mechanics fluttered
around two dehavilands rolled out
men climbed into the cockpits two into
each plane in an instant the propellers
were humming in a grim rhythm

  one and then the other taxied off
banked south in pursuit of the death-
dealing craft and crabbed after that
mere speck in the sky

  lieutenant fareton stood backed
against the door of headquarters as
the hostile plane had darted down his
move had been to block the instinctive
rush outward of the persons inside-
particularly miss juliet as he stepped
aside the rush came and he hastened
to aid the men who had fallen

  he threw his arm around porky
stevens shoulder

  thank heaven porky they didnt
get you

  damn it farry they didnt get
twombly either

  the field was in a hubbub the flight
surgeon moved frantically those un-
injured carried into the little board-
floored tents the injured and the dead

  under stern direction of her father
joliet horder drove the official car off
the field

  after the first hysterical outburst an
enforced calm came into the air

  these names and others came from
the lips of captain horder like so many
shots

  lieutenants twombly - fareton -
stevens--jackson-rich- 

  alertly the men ducked from the
tents and responded to them the
captain stated in crackling syllables
three more men are dead five in
all today the two dits which have
chased the armed ship stand very little
chance the most they can hope to do
is locate the field from which the armed
ship came they may not succeed at

that ill be glad if they come back at
all

  we will stand as prepared as pos-
sible under the circumstances the
captain went on sharply if another
attack should come in the meanwhile
the routine of patrol confronts us
orders are to fly the patrols if flying is
possible it is not impossible yet by
any means the afternoon patrol be-
tween bitter creek and san angelo will
fly as usual

  but- twombly cut in sharp eyes
turned at him

  it happens the captain went on
more slowly that both hennings and
fulton who were to take the eastward
this afternoon are dead king who
was going west with harper is injured
harper will take the west alone i will
send only one man up for the east i
ask for a volunteer for the east
patrol-

  a chorus answered

  one man only and understand
that the machine-gun craft may still be
up

  twombly stepped out a moment
ago i was about to state that i knew
hennings and fulton cant take their
patrol sir some men- his eyes
shifted toward fareton who grew red
of face-some men might think i was
objecting to the usual flight in the face
f such danger in order to offset all
such suspicions i ask to be allowed to
take the east to bitter creek

  wait a second this time the
treble of porky stevens interrupted
lieutenant twombly is a newer man
with the flight than i am he doesnt
know the patrol as well as i do sir i
ask to be allowed to take the east-
twombly will go captain horder
interrupted

  i-i ask again-

  thatll do stevens

  captain horder i-i demand-
at a murderous glare from the captain
porky stevens stepped back his face
wet with sweat i beg pardon sir
dapper twombly turned briskly on
his heel toward the tents a dh had


air stories

been tugged from the hangars by the

feverish mechanics and already warmed
up twombly ran into his tent and
loped back jacketed and helmeted ad-
justing his goggles

  an instant after he was in the cock-
pit the propeller was singing then the
plane taxied lifted stalled into the wind
crabbed off south and deadheaded east
until it became a dark star on a white
sky all eyes kept to it

 then relaxation came and men
dragged themselves wearily to their
tents

  in faretons tent stevens lay on the
cot and fareton sighed

  this man twombly is a dude but he
knows the stick also he lias guts he
knows how to fly and-how to make
love fareton slumped down in his
chair if he was a rotter id feel that
i had some last chance with miss juliet
but hes a pretty good guy and my
chance with the girl isnt worth a
plugged nickle

  stevens moaned

  whats wrong porky

  god farry-you know-ah god i
couldnt have done a more damn fool
stunt than-what i did-

  whatre you talking about not
your insisting on going up

  no stevens opened eyes heavy
with misery farry just before they
brought mckeever and thompson back
i took twombly into my tent friendly
like and gave him a glass of my ginger-
ale well i guess i was just naturally
sore at his lording it over us so much
that he stands in so good with julie-
anyway i thought it would be a good
joke-just a good joke understand-
fareton frowned whatre you
driving at porky

  wait a minute wait till i get the
nerve to tell you what a rotten fool ive
been-thats all

  take your time fareton bade him
laconically	v

  the purring of a ships exhaust came
faintly on the air fareton craned out
of the tent in the southwest two dh

planes were approaching almost side by
side they stepped down to the landing
space and stalled in the pilots hopped
out of the cock-pits captain horder

had come out of headquarters again
and now received their report

  crowding close fareton and stevens
heard

  we lost it sir there are heavy
cloudbanks down over the mountains
and the ship sneaked into them we
couldnt follow too close on account of
the gun-fire also a little short of gas
sir sorry

  be glad youre still breadiing hor-
der grunted and turned on his heel

  when they were together again in
their tent fareton observed to stevens
whoever it is in that mexican plane
lies a flying wild man 

  stevens again turned worried eyes oil
fareton you think theres a chance
they might try to fire on twombly ou
patrol 

  sure theres a chance twombly
knew it when he went up we all did
stevens flung his feet off the cot
farry weve got to do something
fast i told you i wanted to play a joke
on the dude i didnt know all this was
coming up  thought it would be sweet
revenge if i could make him miss that
dinner-date well you know about
how i cant sleep at night always and
have to take powders farry by
heaven i put two powders in twom-
blys drink itll put him to sleep in
the ship farry as sure as youre curs-
ing me now

fareton stared good god
porky that stuffs powerful
you mean to tell me he couldnt stay
awake if he tried

  nothing woukj keep him awake with
those two shots in him its almost
sure death for him farry i-i tried
to keep him from going up-you heard
me

  farry jumped up come along
they hastened to the radio shack and
put their heads in
patrols of peril



  sarge fareton demanded of the
operator twomblys reports are com-
ing in regular 

  one is overdue it ought to be in
any minute-if that machine gun luna-
tic isnt chasing him

  fareton and stevens both paler
turned away swiftly

  porky is it too soon for that stuff
to be working on him now 

  it is not  stevens answered tightly
right this minute twombly may be-
and he finished with a shudder

  fareton ran toward one of the dhs
which was still in the field and signaled
to the mechanic to warm it they has-
tened out for themselves in caps and
goggles fareton gestured stevens into
the fore cock-pit into the rear one
he climbed himself before the mo-
tor caught stevens turned to de-
mand 

  farry whats on your mind 
were going after twombly the
fastest way possible 

  but what can we do now

  if theres anything special to be
done little man ill do it you keep
your hand on the stick and do as i say
then came a word like an explosion
wait

  he poised thoughtfully then leaped
to the ground running straightly for
his tent he ducked under the flap in
the plane stevens fidgeted anxiously
no matter what could or could not be
done every second was precious now
in a moment fareton dodged out of the
tent again ran back to the plane and
legged into the rear cock-pit

  stevens froze his eyes to the controls
  k-k-rrrrrr

  combined with the staccato notes of
the motor came the ground rumble of
the ship as it taxied around and nosed
into the wind then with a gentle tilt
the dh was skimming over the fence
and fast leaving the patchwork of tents
and hangar roofs below

  stevens paralleled into the usual trail
of the afternoon patrol to bitter creek
at two thousand feet faretons eyes

scanned the ground below spotted
clumped with mesquite the band of the
rio grand curling across it scudding
southward and northward at intervals
the ship went up to five thousand feet
as the search went on then stevens
waved toward the northeast where a
plane was spinning evenly along toward
them

  for minutes fareton eyed the plane
half believing it an illusion it was
however real as it came closer fare-
ton saw that it was navigating uncer-
tainly it swerved and veered and was
not maneuvering in a usual manner it
seemed out of control

  stevens glanced back and through the
glass of the goggles fareton saw the
horror in his eyes

  the plane they knew was running
itself no hand was on the controls
they knew that a ship which is accu-
rately aligned and balanced will if it is
driven at the correct speed fly on by it-
self so long as the air is smooth and the
gas holds out both men realized that
twombly feeling the drowsiness com-
ing upon him had set the controls to
this nice adjustment as they arched
up they could see twombly in the pit of
the other ship head hanging forward
but even in sleep braced back to keep
himself from unconsciously pushing
against the stick and so driving himself
to death on the earth below the credit
for his still being in the sky was due to
mechanical perfection and the grace of
god

  the self-flying plane passed them
and stevens banked to the left to chase
it when he leveled off fareton bent
forward tapped stevens shoulder and
signaled that he had something to say
stevens throttled back and let the plane
mush out into a glide

 porky how long will twombly
sleep

  hours 

  thought so theres only one thing
can be done ive got to get onto his
plane

  what youre crazy youre no


air stories

wing-walker you couldnt do it

youve got too much imagination
youd slip off-and were up six thou-
sand

  under the circumstances youre do-
ing what i say listen to me ive got
to land on twomblys tail give her
the gun

  the motor roared again stevens
banked right and carefully crowded his
plane closer to that of the free-flying

dh as the two planes straightened
out fareton divested himself of his
jacket and climbed out of the rear cock-
pit

  more than a mile down the crust of
the earth was rocking giddily floating
 the sea of eternity hanging onto
the struts and wires as he went fareton
toed outward on the wing until he was
hanging at the verge of space at the
tip of the wing

  stevens his face a pasty white be-
neath the leather of his goggles com-
plied he caught faretons signal to
dose in

  the checkboard of the earth was
careening the fragile bodies of the
planes and their death-flashing propel-
lers were appallingly close together a
wind racing at more than a hundred
miles an hour tore at fareton

  still fareton kept his eyes on the
tail of the loose plane as it swung
closer sometimes many feet some-
times only a few separated the wing of
the one plane from the tail of the other
while faretons leg stretched out wait-
ing for his chance

  in the cockpit stevens gazed on it
all as in a dream a shaky move a
sloppy adjustment a turn-out at the
wrong instant and fareton would go
hurtling a mile down to death soon
after twomblys plane would also crash
delicately stevens moved the controls
and the planes weaved closer-while
fareton waited leg outstretched

  then a moment came when the tail
of twomblys ship levelled with the
wing which was carrying fareton and
fareton swung out both his feet left

the wing his hands still clung to the

strut stevens grew frigid the under
plane bumped fareton all but dangled
stevens gently swung over and fare-
ton whirled off falling astride the tail
and punching his fingers through the
linen for a hold

  stevens frantically banked his plane
away

  fareton crawled rapidly up the tail
of twomblys crate and fell inside the
cockpit sitting on twomblys lap
grotesquely high he shot on the gas
and the plane bored ahead steadily

  as stevens arched to the other
planes level fareton waved broadly to
him

  get out of the wray this gesture
plainly said go back home

  stevens was too shaken to question
gladly he complied he banked right
and bee-lined

  as twomblys plane eased down
again fareton strove to get himself in a
position whereby he could work the
stick more easily having done this he
tried to arouse twombly but twom-
bly was not to be aroused the man
was as though dead

  fareton leveled off again and headed
into the wind

  faretons compass straightened him
by the time he had found the bearings
for the plane stevens own dh was
almost out of sight taking it easy
fareton throttled back

  now an avalanche of emotion in con-
trast with his coldness of a few mo-
ments back came upon him he shud-
dered air-sick for the first time he
had never done a plane-change stunt
before in his life and he had no desire
to repeat it his one wish now that he
was steadied agin was to get back to
his tent and take a rest

  the ironic thought struck him that
perhaps if the man could be revived
twombly could keep that dinner date
with miss juliet after all

  he heard close behind him suddenly
the drone of another motor merging
into the whirr of his own ship he
patrols of peril



glanced back-and the blood in his veins
became as ice

  in the rear cockpit of the ship which
was streaming straight toward him a
leather-encased head was rising and
the bore of the machine-gun was level-
ing straight at him

  p-p- pr-rmnrr 

ith insane suddenness even be-
fore the rattle broke out fareton
dove the earth tilted straight up be-
fore the nose of his plane through the
haze he saw the rio grande full ahead
faretoii braced himself madly upon
every possible support he was loose in
the cock-pit without a strap without a
parachute downward he went like a
shot until he skimmed off to the south
banked east steeply and climbed directly
below the other plane

  some of the bullets had penetrated
the fuselage in the rear luckily the
propeller was unhit one bullet would
have splintered it twombly was un-
touched  faretons fast drop had saved
them both

  pr-r-r-rrr 

  again a parade of steel-jacketed bul-
lets raced across space at fareton he
heard the slugs rip through the linen
madly he stomped on the gas and drove
the dh upward at a steeper angle

  fareton knew that if he kept close
under the other plane the machine gun
operator could not reach him the bar-
rel could not drop many degrees below
the cowling of the pit the other plane
swerved and veered to get at fareton
but fareton keeping his eyes always on
it duplicated its every move his life
depended on keeping the bottom of the
other plane close above him

  this was a strange game of hide-and-
seek with death in the sky

  the gun-bearing plane swooped and
fareton swooped likewise then the
mexican plane leveled off and fareton
like a pilot fish on a shark fol-
lowed

  i see youre trying to make me
ease up-think youll catch me napping

eh you babies have got something
coming youre not expecting

  his hand dove into his pocket and
brought out something black and pear-
shaped it was his precious souvenir
hand-grenade the one which he had
forgotten that memorable time in no
mans land to bite off which had
knocked the boche out cold on a wild
notion fareton had run back to fish it
out of his box of mementoes just be-
fore taking off the field on a wild
chance that he might need it now he
gripped it tightly

   he inclined his plane straight up at
the other directly under it and very
close he put the hand-grenade to his
mouth bit it off and tossed it upward
at the same instant he dove and the
earth swung again before his eyes

   the shock of the explosion shook his
own plane dimly fareton saw flash-
ing fragments streaking across his field
of vision the sudden push in the air
made one of the wings of his ship
crackle and the linen rip slightly

  in answer to faretons prayer the
linen held as he put the sky back where
it belonged the ground was very close
again now then-

   ka-weeeeeeee 

   another short crash and the lincoln
motor screamed out like a dying thing
propellers gone

  a weighty fragment from the other
plane had struck it and splintered it

  desperately fareton tried to glide
down the remaining distance he gave
one glance at twombly-still asleep he
shot a look toward the one right wing
which was crumbling and then all at
once fareton passed from daylight into
a darkness which seemed to reach into
the depths of his soul

  he was glad for he was tired he
thought as he fell that he would like to
have a cup of tea

fareton heard porky stevens
talking and feminine voices an-
swered he blinked but could see noth-
ing and at that instant something


air stories

warm trickled between his lips he

almost choked it was tea

  he opened his eyes again determined
to see on the other lied lay twombly
patched with plaster and at his side
miss juliet horder was giving him tea
in a spoon faretons eyes turned
puzzledly to the girl sitting on the edge
of his own bed

  the girls blue eyes were straight into
his she was almost the double of miss
juliet except that she was prettier
yes bewitching as julie was this girl
possessed an even more exquisite charm
as fareton stared he gulped down an-
other spoonful of the tea which she was
giving him

also porky stevens was saying
irrelevently minnie is coming all the
way from tulsa to see me right away
fareton said bluntly whore you
mariet-julies sister i just came

in on the train today for a visit-in-
definitely

  fareton swallowed more tea do
you ever serve tea-at home you do
well may i come up please-if i
promise not to tell you about the time
when i forgot to bite off a hand-grenade
and saved it and took it along up there
just on the chance i might need it and
-go-osh im telling you already
well if  promise not to-

  you may come to tea mariet said
if you promise to tell me every detail
of it her smile was dazzling you
see she added im a newspaper fea-
ture writer and thats copy

  fareton sank back contentedly then
he blinked worriedly he looked at
stevens

  porky he exclaimed did you
remember to bring back a piece of that
machine gun for me-as a souvenir

planes unite alaska

   everyone recalls the epic drive of the staunch gunnar kasson and his
great lead dog balto in their soul-wrenching fight to carry the serum to
disease-infested nome it was a wonderful battle with a man and a fighting
lead dog pitting their indomitable hearts against the fiercest blizzards of the
northern tundra they well earned the red badge of courage but such a
man-killing tearing battle will never be necessary again the airplane has
firmly established itself in the snowlands

   the human-driven hawks of the air have not supplanted the dog teams
altogether for ordinary purposes but where speed is expedient the planes
are in a class alone never again will the menace of a fast-spreading epi-
demic claim a staggering death toll because medical aid is not at hand
never again will whole communities be besieged by a scourge of disease
that runs rampant for weeks before proper preventatives can be had

   much of the interior of alaska has been opened up to air flight by the
establishment of landing fields which stretch from fort yukon to nome
within another six months twenty-five air bases will be constructed with
appropriations made by the last territorial legislation

   fairbanks the operating base of many planes that fly to the outlying
districts is but nine days travel from seattle by rail and water most of the
interior mining camps are inaccessible by mean of ordinary travel in the
summer in the winter they are reached by comparatively slow-moving dog
teams but the plane has cut the distance in half and brought every section
of americas great northland closer together

an air job

by jacfc byrne

if you have the nerve and ambition to become a cloudman this will tell

you where to go to bat-and how

back in the days when the clipper
ships spread their great white
sails from hudsons bay clear
down around the horn the youth of
america heard the call of the sea-the
whistle of a hurricane through the
shrouds the boom boom boom of the
surf pounding a coral shore they
heard the call and they answered it and
with their youth and their strength and
their undying courage they toiled till
their new flag ruled the seas

  then came the call of the west the
pioneer spirit that was kit carsons that
was boones reached out through the
land clerks put down their pens and
joined the wagon trains farmers gave
up the plows to strap on their muskets
from every walk in life they came to
battle with their wilderness and they
stretched their homes from coast to
coast to rule the land

  the sea first then the land and
now they have come to that last great
frontier-the air

  the advance man has made toward
his conquest of the air is common
knowledge the development of heavier-

than-air craft from a purely experimen-
tal stage to its present place in the com-
mercial world has been a part of our
lives in a sense we have all grown up
with it we have come naturally to
recognize aviation as one of the prime
factors of the future-and the same pio-
neer spirit that conquered the land and
the sea is impelling- our young men to
ask questions about it

  does aviation offer me an opportu-
nity they want to know and then
they ask how can i take advantage of
this opportunity how can i learn avi-
ation and get a job in the air

  the answer to the first question is
emphatically yes american aviation
today lias reached a good sound begin-
ning the countries of europe may
boast more widespread routes may
point to their greater number of planes
and a greater volume of business but
experts now declare unanimously that
this condition is only temporary the
united states has solved its air problem
in typical yankee style-and our un-
subsidized privately-owned companies
form a solid basis upon which to build




air storie

you if yeu have certain definite quali-

fications can help in the building

  the qualifications are simple and

concise they are

   	good health and a strong
       body

    	a cofnno-n-school education
        or better

    	an interest in mechanics ami
        a flair for adventure

  if you have these things and with
them an impelling desire to pioneer in a
virgin field aviation offers you an op-
portunity to get in on the ground floor
of course everyone cannot be a pilot
or a flyer any more than every man on
the baseball team can be the pitcher
for every person in the air there must
be at least ten men doing work on the
ground and many of you will find your
opportunity there

  aircraft companies will need aero-
nautical engineers mechanics motor
experts airplane builders and design-
ers assemblers salesmen-and as the
industry develops the need for men
trained in this field will increase just
as it did in the automotive industry and
aviation is growing by leaps and bounds

  the second question-how to learn
aviation and get a job in the flying game
-is more complex and more difficult to
answer it would be best to divide the
answer in two parts  for the fellow
who can afford to take a course in avia-
tion instruction and  for the fellow
who has to make his way while he learns

  if you have between  and
 dollars to spend you can take
a complete training in the theory and
practice of aviation  and with this train-
ing you should be able to get a job that
will repay your investment-and with
interest there are hundreds of schools
and private operators who can teach you
the business of flying several of our
leading colleges offer technical courses
for more advanced students there are
even organizations that offer courses
in aeronautics by correspondence the

prospective student has a wide choice

  air stories will be glad to help you
in the selection of a school to meet
your own requirements if you say the
word

  if you have to make your way while
you learn you might well consider the
chance that is offered young men inter-
ested in aviation by the united states
army air corps

  the soldiers of the army air corps
are offered intensive courses which not
only qualify them for specialists ratings
and higher non-commissioned officer
grades but also give them a training
that should enable them to make their
way in commercial aviation after their
enlistment is expired there is also the
opportunity for soldiers to gain appoint-
ment as flying cadets the flying
cadets course qualifies the student as
an expert pilot at the conclusion of
this course the student is honorably dis-
charged from the army and becomes
eligible to take examination for an
officers commission in the reserve
corps

  a typical example of the aeronautical
training the air corps offers are the
courses given by the air service tech-
nical school at chanute field illinois
these courses are given to specially
selected enlisted men and to recruits who
are sent to the school before they are
assigned to units there are no hard
and fast rules governing the entrance
requirements except perhaps the three
primary qualifications we mentioned
before the school is divided in three
departments one of photography one
of communication and one of me-
chanics

  the department of photography has
been in operation for five years and is
conducted under the most advanced
methods opportunities in aerial photog-
raphy are unlimited both in the military
and commercial sense the work is in-
teresting varying as it does from the
operation of motion picture cameras to
photographing large sections of the
united states and assembling the hun-
how to get an air job



dreds of pictures thus taken into maps
men trained in this work are needed in
war times to map enemy territory in the
same manner in times of peace the
aerial photographer is offered many
chances for employment by the fact that
these aerial maps are displacing blue-
prints in a great number of engineering
projects an aerial survey was recently
taken of chicagos lake front stretches
of land that are heavily covered with
undergrowth are practically all being
surveyed from the air

  the course in the communications de-
partment consists of training for radio
mechanics and operators the use of
radio in connection with aviation is
gradually assuming greater importance
in the commercial field since machines
capable of making long ocean flights
have been developed it has always been
of prime importance in warfare can-
didates for this course should be inter-
ested in radio work have at least three
years in high school or its equivalent
and though not necessary training or
experience in any of the following lines
is desirable-radio operator commer-
cial telegrapher or electrician

  the department of mechanics offers
training in a number of subjects such
as airplane and auto mechanics aircraft
armorers and in the construction repair
and inspection of airplanes this is con-
sidered the most important course since
airplanes depend on theirmechanical
well-being requirements are a com-
mon school education or its equivalent
and some experience in a line similar to
the course taken

  these three courses all last about
twenty-four weeks in the first two
courses new classes begin every month 
in the mechanics course every second
month chanute field is located at
rantoul illinois  miles south of
chicago the training offered at this
field is just an example of the training
offered at the many other air corps
schools air stories will furnish further
information in regard to these schools
at your request

   if you cant afford the aviation school
and the army air corps doesnt appeal
to you then the only thing left to do is
to hunt a job with an air-transport com-
pany or with some organization engaged
in the manufacture of airplane parts and
accessories this way might be called
the back-door to aviation

  the back-door isnt the pleasantest
way in the world to get in but the fact
that some of the biggest names in pres-
ent-day aviation made their start this
way proves that it can be done they
learned the game from the ground up
started at the very bottom of the
ladder-and what one man has done
can be done again if youve got the
stuff

  when you consider the number of
organizations operating commercial air
routes the increasing number of com-
panies engaged in the manufacture of
airplane parts the widespread number
of smaller companies engaged in avia-
tion it is easy to understand that there
is a chance at the bottom of the ladder
now and the industry is growing so
rapidly that every day sees that chance
assuming larger proportions

  you want to appreciate right now
though that getting a job in the air is a
mighty tough proposition for the inex-
perienced man-the same tough proposi-
tion that the inexperienced man faces in
any line of work the only solution is
to keep on trying and keep on fighting
until you do get a job

  go to some airplane manufacturing
company or to some company engaged
in commercial flying and try to break
in with them take anything start
as a janitor or a painter or an office
boy-start at anything as long as you
start if you have the qualifications
we noted before and you have the de-
sire to get in the air you can ttuike
your job take you wherever you want
to go

  men arent bom into bank presidents
jobs they fight their way up to them
its the same in aviation as it is in any
other game
jump and he did

dear editor

  the closest call ive had thats
pretty hard to say flyings like any
other business after a year or so it
all seems like part of a days work and
the first half dozen smashes are the
worst still there was one episode in
my army training in which it seemed as
though yours truly had shouted his
last contact

  was up in a martin bomber prac-
ticing bombing formations i was fly-
ing no  in the unit two of the other
planes dropped out of position and i
pulled up to no  our altitude was
about  feet well over the clouds
the leader signaled for a right-hand
turn i banked her and started over
toward the ship next in line all set to
follow the leader on the turn

  everything seemed fine when the
plane in front banked up suddenly his
controls were all set for the turn when
he struck that air bump the controls
simply didnt take and he came up with
a jerk to prevent a jam i gave her
the throttle and started for elevation
just as we began to climb i felt a big
jolt and knew wed been socked in the
rear looked around and saw the
aileron on the lower right wing was
gone in case you dont know an
aileron is a smaller wing or plane for


lateral balance use them for banking on
a turn

  i shoved the aileron controls to the
left and jammed on my second motor
to try and lift the right wing into posi-
tion no luck the bomber went into
a nasty spin and though i worked like
the devil i couldnt bring her out
when we were losing altitude like a
plummet i tapped my buddy on the
shoulder and signaled him to jump

  as i climbed out of the cockpit my-
self i stole a last glance at my altitude
meter but couldnt read it working
back on the fuselage i let go with my
hands waited until id turned over once
in the air and jerked the ring

  landed o k in a patch of mesquite
with a sprained ankle about five miles
from the flying field thats about the
nastiest one i ever was in and i dont
want to try it again just doing nice
safe stunt flying now

dear editor 

  as an ex-army officer i was appointed
to test a big twin-motored fokker for a
commercial air line when i got to the
airdrome and saw that big cantilever-
winged bird being towed out of the
hangar i felt mighty proud with a

i
air hawks



confident roar i answered the me-
chanics contact those two 
horsepower motors sounded pretty
we got off nicely into the wind and i
taxied her easily across the field of
course theres always some slight bump-
ing before she takes the air but i be-
gan to notice a regular thump from one
of the wheels thought nothing of it
and began to give her the gun to get up
when she listed to the left and tore
across a hummock on the edge of the
grounds

  got her up and was seeing how fast
shed climb when i noticed one of the
single-seaters climbing on our tail he
veered off reached our level and be-
gan to signal frantically my assistant
officer spoke to me through the tele-
phone and said it was probably the run-
ning gear i held an even course while
he snaked out on the wing and checked
up when he spoke through that phone
again i began to feel damn shaky here
i was with several thousand dollars
worth of air-machine in the air and a
dangling running gear

  we had to come down some time so
i worked her around to the other end
of the field circling until i was into the
wind just before i dropped i saw the
ambulance draw up outside the en-
closure cheerful sight flying low
banking heavily on alternate wings i
brought her running straight across the
lot almost on a level plane and losing
altitude slowly i heard a shouted
great stuff through the ear phones
then i brought her down banking
heavily on the left there was a lurch
a sharp scrape a couple of bumps and
the big baby was limping ahead across
the turf absolutely all right except for
a crippled landing gear and i fear it
was mostly luck

a duel in the air

dear editor

  was performing with an air circus
over san diego when i thought my

time had come we were going through
a game of exhibition squadron maneu-
vers for the benefit of several thousand
people below we had fallen into the
regulation v scout formation when the
boss who was piloting the lead plane
signaled for a complete turn i was in
a curtiss two-seater an ancient hack
that had seen its best days the man at
the throttle was an irresponsible cuss a
newcomer to the company with a bitter
grudge against one of our regular
fliers they were both crack stunt per-
formers and their rivalry had become
more than friendly competition they
were out to get each other

  as i watched the squadron wheel i
discovered that my pilots opponent was
on our direct left and crowding us
closely my pilot refused to give an
inch i could see his eyes glint behind
the goggles as he watched that other
plane as they swung into the turn
the wing tips were almost overlapping
maybe it looked great from below but
thats bad business three thousand feet
up minus parachutes

  too late they both pulled out of it
my pilot swept into a dive with the
curtiss the other chap climbed there
was a scraping crunch guy wires
snapped and there we were half way to
heaven with a crippled left wing ive
always had a good deal of admiration
for that lad when he got her down with
nothing more than a pile-up in a ditch
but never again with these fight-to-a-
finish boys who like to do their dueling
in the air

dear editor 

  ive had a few close calls around a
flying field but its always been some-
thing like tripping over a monkey-
wrench or missing out on the mess call
but we had one good story down in
texas there was a new york man
down there trying to learn flying at the


air stories

governments expense during the war
wejl call him smith

  in the air smith was all kinds of an
aviator loop the loops immelmans
nose dives tail spins all were soup for
this baby but when it came to bring-
ing a plane back to earth it was another
matter in the air smith looked like an
ace few mechanics or observers
wanted to go up with him he just
seemed to go crazy when he got up
among the clouds with a joy stick in his
hands and he got away with that

  but when it came to bringing a bus
down smith took all-comers trophy for
two-point landings on the wing and
nose he showed those air officers more
ways of bringing a plane to the landing
field than theyd ever imagined

  hed a weakness for turning her up
on her nose and cracking a fresh pro-
peller and he just couldnt seem to
help laying her down on either wing
it wasnt because he didnt try either

  finally the day he brought a new
pursuit plane down and tore off the tail
on a hangar smith was christened the
great german ace hed wrecked
more planes than their crack airmen
combined-two-point smith

        a storm stunter

dear editor

  tightest pinch i was ever in was at a
time when there were about two thou-
sand other lives in danger besides my
own had picked up an old army de
haviland and was doing exhibition fly-
ing about the country signed a con-
tract to do a three-day run for a county
fair out in ohio first two days every-
thing went off o k the old de havi-
land limped across the fair grounds
staggered up into the sky and i pro-
ceeded to do my stuff to the tune of
groaning struts and shrieking guy wires
but the fun came the third day

  just before i warmed up the bus a

slight drizzle began to fall i called one
of the fair officiajs over and asked him
about postponing the flight until the
drizele stopped the visibility was poor
and i knew just what my old taxi was
capable of doing but the fair commit-
tee wouldnt hear of such a thing they
couldnt see how rain wrould hurt and
they wanted the stuff pulled off-or
forfeit the contract

  i made up my mind i w-ouldnt die
alone so i told them id go up if one
of them went with me after a lot of
argument one fellow climbed into the
cockpit we got off all right and i
eased her up gently circling across the
fair grounds after the meter showed
 feet i went into my first loop
looked around as we came out of it
and that passenger was green- any-
thing was worth it after that banked
and turned a couple of times and went
into a double loop

  came out of that and i looked down
at the crowd they were gone a
heavy blanket of mist had blown in and
i could feel the motor laboring in the
wind just as i decided to climb above
it the old de haviland coughed choked
sputtered a few times and quit i
caught it once and she began missing
again

  climbing was out of the question and
i eased her along unable to see the tip
of my own wing not alone the field
it was impossible to measure the wind
drift when she missed again and
wed gone into a nasty spin i didnt
even know whether we were flying right
side up

  was peering over the side w-atching
for that field suddenly a blob of red
swam by a concessit tent almost under
the running gear right behind it was
a mass of heads the crowd zooming
open that throttle i brought her around
swung into the wind and made a perfect
three-point landing not fifty yards from
the line of onlookers never again
