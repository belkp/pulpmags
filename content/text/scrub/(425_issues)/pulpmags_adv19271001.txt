celebrated crimes

this mysterious prisoner on the ramparts of an
     island prison has always excited the most in-
     tense interest what was the life which he

exchanged for one silent as the grave  what had
he done who was he what was his past
the dissolute life of a courtier or the devious

ways of an intriguing diplomat had some fair
one in the hallowed circle of royalty loved not
wisely but too well  why during all these years
has he remained the greatest of all mysteries

 none dared tell secret
some believe that he was a twin or even
elder brother of louis xiv a true heir to
the crown hidden from the time of his birth
others think that he was the eldest illegiti-
mate son of charles ii or that heand not
louis xiii was the actual father of louis
xiv some have thought that he was the
son of buckingham and the queen of france
others that he was the son of louis xiv and
de la valliere to have revealed it would
have cost anyone his life the regent admit-
ted when drunk that the prisoner was a son
of anne of austria and mazarin louis xv
refused to tell madame de pompadour
madame campan stated that louis xvi did
not know the secret de chamillart on his
deathbed declined to reveal the secret

masked-his face his secret
in  there was hurried across france a
masked man whose identity was shrouded in
mystery never has a prisoner been guarded
with such vigilance and with such fear of his
story becoming known he was taken to an
island prison where the governor carried his
food to him a confessor saw him once a year
but no other visitor ever laid eyes on him
he zvas always masked-his face alone
would tell his secret

  he was well treated supplied with fine
clothing books and served from silver dishes
the governor stood before him uncovered
and addressed him as mon prince when
the prisoner wrote messages on his white
linen he was supplied only with black

   he is not a myth as is proven by letters be-
tween louvois the minister and saint-mars
the governor of the prison these are all
written in veiled language never once is he
given a name no letter mentions his crime
or whether he had committed one

secret even after death

this horrible punishment ended when in
 the most mysterious of all prisoners
died and was buried in the dead of night
under a false name and given a false age

his cell was carefully painted so that any
message he might have written would be
covered up and everything he used was de-
stroyed lest any clew might be left thus
vanished a man whose name and identity
was unknown even to his gaoler -some think
even to the prisoner himself

why was his life preserved

what was the reason for all this secrecy
what crime if any did this man evidently
of exalted rank commit that he should be

buried alive for life why did the king
preserve the life of this prisoner why did he
not have him put to death the subject
becomes more mysterious as we investigate

long buried records found
the mystery has always terrified the im-
agination and excited speculation with the
nineteenth century came an opportunity to
search long-buried records dumas did so
and told the whole story in one of the
volumes of the strangest and most curious
set of books ever published which he called

   a collection never before completely translated into english of stories of the most sensational crimes
crimes prompted by illicit love envy ambition religion-stories of poison plots abductions treachery intrigue and
conspiracies gleaned from hidden archives we pass through secret passages see lurking figures and the gleam of the
assassins blade we hear the muffled moan the splash hurried footsteps it is the first and absolutely the only com-
plete and unabridged translation of this series printed from the same plates as the edition de luxe sold at  a
set the edition offered is illustrated by jacques wagrez of paris and beautifully bound with emblematic designin gold

   none of the editions of dumas contain these stories and no set of dumas is complete without them

   intrigues of a licentious court

    in one volume dumas tells us of the vices
 and crimes of that extraordinary family the
 borgias that furnished one pope and some
 of the blackest pages in history we see the
 murderous poisonous crew with their greedy
 craving for debauchery titles and gold we
 watch the career of the beautiful but depraved
 lucrezia we see the intrigues of the medi-
 aeval papal court-the murders abductions
 poisonings-drawn from the chronicles of eye-
 witnesses which frankly call a spade a spade

 nothing in the world like them

    let dumas tell you about the beautiful but
  indiscreet mary stuart as queen of france
  and scotland her amours her barbarous im-
  prisonment and murderous execution one of
  the greatest crimes of history you learn to
  know intimately the men and women whose
  crimes have contributed the tragedy to the
  history of the old world

the

dark

regiment

 across the mesa
f- a line of white
-l targets bobbed
up and down dust
spurted in small foun-
tains about them

great disks black red
andoccasionally white
rose solemnly up from
the earth and lightly
touched the faces of
the serene squares of
white now and again
derisive little red flags
would wave ironically
mockingly across the

  back on the firing line where a lone
row of dust-colored serious-eyed men lay
prone major davies sighed as the red
flag was waved for the fourth time over
number ten target

  you see swanson he said gently to
the somber-eyed soldier who had just
fired you missed again because you
flinched lets try it once more this
time hold your breath and squeeze the
trigger as gently as you can here let
me load for you and he reached for the
rifle inserted the shell and handed back
the gun ready to fire

 the man slipped his arm through the
leather sling settled the butt of the gun
firmly to his shoulder lined up his front
and rear sights and carefully drew his

breath holding it as
he squeezed the trig-
ger suddenly he gave
a convulsive jerk the
trigger snapped-but
there was no explosion
swanson stared at the
gun looking bewil-
dered some one
laughed near-by

  you see how you
jumped then  i
played a little trick on
you by putting in an
empty shell now try
it again here ill load your rifle
the soldier took the gun this time a
skeptical look on his face he wasnt
going to be caught by that trick a second
time he carefully aimed and squeezed
the trigger much to his surprize the
firing pin exploded a loaded shell he
stared stupidly as the target on his front
dropped down into the earth and a fresh
one came up he waited while the men in
the pits found and pasted the bullet-hole
and put up a great disk marking a point
a little below and to the right of the bulls-
eye a pleased grin on his face he
turned to davies

  whad dyou know about that he
marveled a four an exultant
gleam came into his eyes

  now a slight turn to the elevation
by malcolm wheeler-nicholson

screw and a half-point on the windage will
bring you into the bulls-eye this time
encouraged davies

  the sights were adjusted the man
sighed happily and snuggled down with
the stock of his rifle against his cheek
this time he did not flinch a great
white disk rode up from the pit and cov-
ered the face of the black bulls-eye
his eyes fairly shone as he watched it

  davies rose brushing the white alkali
dust from his knees and wiping the per-
spiration from his face

  get the major a chair sergeant
henderson ordered one of the men
better take it easy awhile sir he cau-
i ioned the old man youve been a-layin
in that sun all morning teachin these
dumbbells how to get on a target and this
texas sun aint no joke

  davies sat back gratefully and rolled
a cigaret captain montgomery the
lean-faced adjutant nodded in approval

  seems to me he added judiciously
that if i were a field-officer and were
supposed to sit around and look wise id
take it easier

  davies looked up at him reflectively
maybe you would and maybe you
wouldnt next to picking up a pat
straight flush i dont know any greater
thrill than taking a perspiring and per-
severing soldier who cant hit a flock of
barns and exhorting him into making

a string of fives its the getting of
such definite results that puts the kick
into it

  well they certainly are perspiring
and persevering enough these birds
dont do a thing but eat sleep and talk
shooting all through target season
montgomery glanced over to where a
near-by group of soldiers were heatedly
comparing scores

  sure agreed davies nodding the
average soldat americain likes shooting
target season offers him the only oppor-
tunity throughout a boresome year to
aim at something definite the rest of
the year he has nothing to aim at and he
generally succeeds in hitting it

  soldiers arent very much interested
in their daily work admitted mont-
gomery blamed if i see why theyre so
keen on shooting

  well they get better pay if they shoot
well for one thing but the biggest thing
is that they are competing with other
men and beating out the other fellow
always tickles an american pink its
his heritage of sporting instinct and be-
cause of that heritage the american army
is the finest shooting army in the world
bar none

  is that so major

  yes if the rest of our military work
only came up to our shooting wed have
some army and it would be so blame


malcolm wheeler-nicholson

easy davies said half to himself staring
thoughtfully over to where the men
waited their turns at firing

  montgomery took the bolt out of his
rifle and wiped it carefully sergeant
henderson came up and said something
to him

  swanson rolled up a score of forty-
two at this range major he informed
davies says its the highest score he
ever made

  davies nodded unimpressed

  certainly he had it in him he stated
calmly and hes got a lot more stuff in
him swanson is an average american
soldier and the american soldier is like
an eight-cylinder car under our slightly
antediluvian army methods we only
manage to get him working on two cyl-
inders if wed use the same sense in our
other work that we show in our rifle prac-
tice hed be hitting up on all eight and
running smoothly and powerfully
z montgomery was adjusting his field
glasses and examining the range before
him

  how are you going to tune him up
he asked casually

  davies stared across the mesa the
young captain glanced sidewise at his tall
lean frame at his serious mouth and chin
and at the kindliness of the eyes above
them but there was something in the
look of those eyes now that reminded him
of beelzebub the golden sorrel mare that
davies had changed from a regimental
hoodoo into a regimental mascot both
the mare and the man were built on
rangy powerful thoroughbred lines and
both the man and the mare had that same
trick of staring off into infinite distance
as if visualizing far horizons

  how are you going to tune up the
army

  davies came back to earth again

  ill tell you about the time i served
under colonel timmy phelan maybe
you can gather how not to tune up an
army at least ever hear of timmy
phelan

  have i montgomery threw up his
hands i didnt know youd ever

served under him ive heard some weird

stories

  you havent heard the half of it
grunted the major listen-

  and he sat up in his canvas chair and
began to talk stopping at intervalsto
watch the men on the firing line telling
his tale to the accompaniment of the
steady crackle of rifle-fire as the targets
rose curtsied and disappeared very
much in the manner of a line of old ladies
rehearsing a minuet

  and this is the tale as he told it

in those days davies was a lieuten-
ant his tour of foreign service falling
due he was ordered to join the nth cav-
alry on the mexican border that regi-
ment being under orders to go to the
philippines the nth was a colored
regiment

  being a lieutenant and not being a very
high ranking lieutenant the regimental
commander assigned him to what was
then known as the machine-gun platoon
it was an orphan outfit wedged in some-
where in the regiment and sniffed at
generally by most of the older cavalry
officers

  being an orphan outfit it was made up
of men detailed from the regularly or-
ganized troops in the regiment as the
commanders of these other troops were
allowed to recommend whom they pleased
for this detail naturally they saw a heav-
en-sent opportunity to get rid of their
worst goldbricks-the army term for a
soldier who divides his time between going
absent without leave and repining in the
guardhouse

  as a consequence when davies ex-
amined his morning report he read it
with a steadily deepening frown

  is this right sergeant he turned to
the coal-black non-commissioned officer
weve got twenty-four men in this pla-
toon and eighteen of them are either
a w o l or in confinement

  yes sah lieutenant the acting
first sergeant rolled his eyes solemnly
dis here outfits done been pretty bad
utilized 
the dark regiment

  pretty bad what davies had still
to learn not to look puzzled when the
colored trooper sounded off with a high-
falutin word the peculiarity of the negro
troopers use of words being that one can
generally get his meaning in spite of how
he says it

  dey done been pretty bad utilized
sah lieutenant aint nobody paid much
attention to dis here platoon and de men
gets kind o fractious the old sergeant
wrinkled his brow painfully in an en-
deavor to make himself clear

  i see nodded davies with a per-
fectly straight face theyve been de-
moralized by the inscrutable indifference
of a higher command which has unac-
countably denied them their due need of
cooperation

  yes sah lieutenant yes sah the
sergeant replied heartily a great awe in
his eyes dats just what ah was tryin to
tell the lieutenant and davies could see
his lips moving silently in the attempt to
memorize the luscious great long words

  suddenly it came over davies that he
was home again among a race that he
knew and liked and he thought back to
his boyhood days and the great trees be-
fore his grandfathers house in tennessee
and the kindly cheerful black folk among
whom he had spent his boyhood days

  listen here- he turned on the negro
suddenly so that the worthy sergeant
blinked and stepped back a pace-you
get word around to those worthless black
boys who are absent that theyd better
get back here quicker than scat if they
know whats good for them

  unknown to himself davies speech
had slipped back into a softer more liquid
note a note that the colored man recog-
nized instantly

  now sergeant im going to try to
hornswoggle the commanding officer into
lettin me have these other worthless
no-account triflin niggers out of the
guardhouse and were going to have a
real outfit lined up here tomorrow
yes sah lieutenant

  the sergeant was emphatic he sa-
luted and bustled out immensely im-

portant his face shining with satisfaction

  hes real white folks was the word
that went out concerning davies

  the sergeant worked to good purpose
the lieutenant retrieved his men from
confinement next morning saw some
twenty-two earnest black faces staring
rigidly to the front as davies inspected
them

  the young officer was none too happy
over the prospect he had been exam-
ining the descriptive lists of each of the
men before him scarcely a one but had
several summary courts martial ora special
court or two some of them even had
records of general courts chalked against
them they were veritably the worst
men in the regiment all thankfully de-
tailed to the machine-gun platoon by
troop commanders anxious to get rid of
them at any cost evidently courts
martial had no terrors for them some-
thing else would have to be invoked
could he stir up their pride he won-
dered it was worth a chance

  you men belong to the machine-gun
platoon davies gave them at case
and talked seriously do you realize
the weight of responsibility that hangs
on each man of a machine-gun platoon
no ill tell you if you handle your
machine-guns carefully each man of you
is worth twenty ordinary men armed with
rifles get that and think it over

  the negroes looked impressed

  every time one of you goes to the
guardhouse or goes absent without leave
twenty men go to pot

  black foreheads wrinkled in thought
white eyeballs rolled solemnly

  now we are engaged in serious busi-
ness some day our country is going to
need us when uncle sam calls on us
are we going to fall down on him

  black heads shook in violent negation
ive been looking over your records
men looked sidewise at one another
some of them are not so good but all
thats over with as far as im concerned
you all start with a clean sheet

  a look of vast relief spread over the
faces of the assembled negroes


malcolm wheeler-nicholson

  trouble is with you you never knew
before what an honor it is to handle ma-
chine-guns nowadays machine-guns
are so important that only the best men
are picked for them they are the corps
delite of the army

  it was very plain to be seen that none
knew the meaning of the term but they
were all vastly impressed

 remember that word now you are
the corps delite of the regiment and of the
army and if any man of you forgets and
misbehaves the rest of us will throw him
right out and send him back with the
ordinary cavalry soldiers where he be-
longs

  they all nodded violently then and
there each soldier decided emphatically
that he would not be the luckless man
who made the first break	m

  davies dismissed them they all went
chattering to their barracks from the
hubbub of excited comment he knew that
they had taken his words to heart

  if theyll only believe half of that it
may perk them up he mused maybe
something can be done with this outfit
after all now id better go and see what
a machine-gun looks like

sergeant turnbull waiting
until the officer was out of sight had
gathered his black cohorts around him in
the machine-gun barracks

  ah wants you young soldiahs to listen
to what ah says you all done seen our
new officah now lemme tell you some-
pen ahs served undeh moah officahs
than what you has ever seen some is
good officahs and some is bettah dis
here lootenant is one o the better hes
been bawn and raised with cullud folks
he aims to get along with cullud folks but
he aint gonna stand for no foolishness
howsomever he says to me no longer
than yesterday- the sergeant swelled
out his chest grandly- he says ser-
geant he says to me dis here outfit
aint goin to no longer be inscrutabilized
in a no accountable fashion by a cooper-
cooperashun o de higher command 
the sergeant paused dramatically t

allow these words to sink in white
eyeballs rolled black faces look awed
the sergeant went on

  and foh you-all men what aint had
the advantages of eddication ahll state
that de lootenant means by them words
that if any loose-livin splay-footed
slack-jawed shifty-eyed nigger in dis
here outfit tries any foolishness de loo-
tenant will cloud up and rain on dat said
individual until dat said individual afore-
said will wish hisself travelin from else-
where to whence yas sah and when dat
lootenant of ourn clouds up somebody
am a-goin to git powerful wet

  the dusky troopers were visibly im-
pressed

the day finally arrived when the
regiment entrained for san fran-
cisco the machine-gun platoon having
been neglected had no troop fund and
davies himself had to pay off their debts
before they left the regiment left camp
marching on foot led by the band
davies liked the spick-and-span trimness
of these colored soldiers their khaki uni-
forms clean and pressed at all times their
hats carefully blocked their leather leg-
gins shined to the last word

  what he liked most of all was their
marching it was his first view of negro
troops marching to music and he mar-
veled at that indescribably cadenced
crackle and snap that distinguishes the
marching of the negro soldier from that of
all other troops

  it set him to wondering what sort of
fighting men the colored men were he
knew that the american negroes as a
whole were not descended from the war-
rior tribes of africa that their ancestors
came from the slave coast the gold
coast and from what is now liberia and
that they were unwarlike tribes sold into
slavery by old king maccoco among
them he saw finer more distinguished
looking specimens men with the eagle
glance the proud bearing and the reddish
skins of the bambarra that warrior
tribe of africa these men were gen-
erally non-commissioned officers
the dark regiment



  the regimental sergeant major a tall
dignified gray-haired negro had all the
poise and bearing of a king and the dis-
tinguished courtesy of a trained ambassa-
dor he might easily have been the leader
of a zulu impi most certainly the finer
types of american negroes could be
found in the army their records as
soldiers had been good when they were
well led

  of course there was that affair at
carrizal but their white officers had been
killed first as a rule they would follow a
good officer anywhere there was that
unpleasant affair in the early days in the
philippines when one of the negro organi-
zations had risen en masse and killed its
white officers

 this incident puzzled davies it
seemed hard to believe somehow the
natural instincts of these people were
kindly the young officer finally came
to the conclusion that the white officers
killed by their own colored men must
have been at fault must have driven
their men to such action by brutally un-
tactful handling

  and there were officers in the army as
every one knew who should never be al-
lowed to have command of men such
officers seemed unable to rouse anything
but vindictiveness in their subordinates
he had often heard of one officer a certain
colonel phelan known throughout the
army as timmy phelan whose disposi-
tion was such that his entire regiment had
walked out from under him down on the
border it was common gossip in the
arm but the thing was hushed up offi-
cially and of course never got in the
papers

  with these thoughts in mind davies
took advantage of the long train trip to
san francisco to study his men carefully
and to work out a system that would
assist in getting the best results with them

  they arrived at san francisco at last
the nth cavalry joyously took possession
of the transport pay-day just before
embarking had left them all in funds
naturally crap games large and small
went on everywhere the commanding

officer of troops the senior officer on
board an infantry colonel sought zeal-
ously to break these up and he complained
bitterly to major wentworth who was
temporarily in command of the regiment

  guards were increased until nearly half
the nth cavalry was engaged in guarding
the other half finally when the colonel
made a flying inspection and found the
guards shooting craps with the guarded
he gave in and let nature take its course
thereafter for a few days below decks
resounded happily with objurgations to
little jo and eighter from decatur
then the bothersome loose money hav-
ing drifted by easy stages into the hands
of the more skilled the fever of excite-
ment died down

  it was then that the regimental chap-
plain organized the minstrel shows
these were unique with due regard to
the amenities governing minstrel shows
the black performers never failed to apply
large quantities of burnt cork to their
faces the after deck was rigged up
with a stage on this as the transport
plowed its way through the tropic seas
the nth cavalry minstrels frolicked gaily
their quips and jokes sending vast roars
of homeric laughter out to startle the
lone seagulls following the ship through
the wastes

  at night the tinkle of many banjos and
guitars and the rich voices of the men
blended into harmony such as only the
negro can produce the ship moved
across the great spaces of the pacific
with music and song pouring out under
the tropic moon

  davies occupied his spare time in
studying the machine-guns and learning
their every part after two weeks of this
he was convinced that the benet-mercier
was an excellent gun providing one had a
troop of swiss watchmakers to operate it

  honolulu provided the first break in
the long voyage major wentworth
called the officers together and informed
them that there would be a days shore-
leave for the men

 talk to your men before they go
ashore you know as always happens


malcolm wheeler-nicholson

some whit-e soldier on police guard calls a
group of our men black or nigger and the
war is on see if we cant avoid it this
time

  but in spite of warnings there was a
miniature riot the officers were called
out in the small hours of the morning to
patrol honolulu and return all men to the
ship this was the first time that davies
realized the potentialities of the colored
man for swift anger he came up to a
group of them on a side street they
were organizing a rescue for three of their
comrades picked up by the white
provost guards the negroes seemed to
be in a daze their eyes staring they
acted in unison silently but very much
as men who were undfer the influence of
drugs davies straightened them out and
got them back on the ship but the
experience made him study his men
anew

  major wentworth was a quiet-voiced
unobtrusive commanding officer who
saw everything said little but corrected
anything wrong very swiftly and cer-
tainly he was immensely relieved
when the anchor was raised again to
the tune of hawaii nei played by the
band on the dock and with every one
wearing the ceremonial lei wreaths the
transport set sail

  not until ten more days had passed did
they sight guam that far-flung outpost
of the united states-a tiny speck in the
pacific-which served as a coaling station
for the navy

a few days more saw them entering
manila bay the nth marvelled ex-
ceedingly at the great gray vastness of
corregeidor that american gibraltar of
the far east rising sheer from the floor
of the harbor passing it they studied
the innocent-looking cliffs that towered
up above them knowing full well that
the huge fortress of living rock was
honeycombed with passages and chamb-
ers that great guns crouched in hidden
emplacements below its crests and that
the silent mass could almost at the touch
of a button erupt into flaming roaring

anger heaving a destructive hail of riven
steel on an enemy fleet

  manila unfolded before them with its
great sea wall its medieval spanish
quarter its modern buildings its crowds
of gaily garbed natives its streets filled
with carrometas and calesas pulled by
somnolent ponies its lumbering two-
wheeled carts drawn by sullen looking
carabao its air redolent with the heavy
scent of ylatig-ylang blossoms a teeming
thriving metropolis of which america
may well be proud

  the men were hugely delighted as they
piled aboard the cars which were to carry
them to camp stotsenburg in pam-
panga province the little narrow-gage
trains hauled by vociferating green-and-
gold locomotives sped through tangled
stretches of jungle through great mead-
ows of tangled kogan grass hurrying
through native barrios full of naked brown
children discouraged looking chickens
prowling bluish-colored dogs and fierce
razorbacked pigs

  the stations were crowded with swel-
tering humanity-white-clad loose-
shirted barefoot men each with his
fighting cock under his arm and volumin-
ously skirted soft-eyed women gracefully
balancing great baskets on their heads
carrying smooth-skinned yellow mangoes
or green papayas or red-and-yellow and
purple bananas or bottles of dark rice
beer or finely chopped ice splotched with
scarlet fruit juice

 camp stotsenburg was a sprawling
army post with the usual long line of bar-
racks on one side of the large parade
ground facing the officers club and houses
on the other the houses were low
wooden frame buildings with nipa
thatched roofs

  the men settled into quarters and
quickly made themselves comfortable
the horses of the former regiment were
turned over to them and the routine of
garrison life commenced

  the heat was intense so intense that in
the philippines officers were forbidden to
drill men in the afternoon therefore the
morning was taken up with the drill
the dark regiment



and stables and the afternoon saw a vast
silence descend upon the great canton-
ment as every one took the siesta so
necessary in the heat of the tropics

  as the heat of the day lessened toward
sunset the post gradually came to life
officers were out with their tennis and
polo while the men busied themselves
with baseball practise later in the day
the officers changed into the white-and-
gold of the tropical evening dress the
band played from the parade ground
there was the sudden blare of trumpets
and the regiment lined up a great si-
lence fell over the place as the silvery
notes of retreat rang out the strains of
the star spangled banner floated out
over the jungles and the flag came slowly
down from its staff

  from the officers club the cheerful
notes of dance music filled the moonlit
nights from the mens quarters came the
sound of song and happy laughter the
tinkle of banjos and guitars and the
shuffle of many feet keeping time to the
dancing harmony

  davies came in the first day after
getting his platoon settled so intense
was the moist heat that taking off his
khaki uniform he dropped it on the
floor where it slumped like a wet bathing
suit

  at the bachelors mess they found a
heritage of white-clad barefoot native
boys who waited on the officers looked
after their laundry pressed their clothes
and served at table they were from all
parts of the philippines-visayans taga-
logs illocanoes matabeles and others of
the diverse tribes that inhabit the islands
so dissimilar were the languages of all
these natives that they had perforce
to converse with one another in english

the machine-gun platoon was
assigned a small barracks away
down behind the other line of mens
quarters most troops have a troop fund
belonging to the men and built up from
contributions and various assessments
from this fund baseball and football sup-
plies magazines phonographs pool tables

and other things are purchased for the
soldiers the poor old machine-gun pla-
toon had nothing of this their barracks
was bare and naked davies resenting
this bought from his own pocket a pool
table and a phonograph two essentials to
any soldier barracks this cheered up the
outfit considerably

  davies wasted no time in getting the
men started on the machine-guns he
had four of them around the benet-
merciers he built up four squads of men
now the orthodox method of getting
men trained in the army is to keep them
at drill-a daily repetition of the same
movements until some degree of per-
formance is reached but davies wanted
to do more than that he wanted his men
to breathe live and eat machine-guns to
the exclusion of almost every other in-
terest to do that men have to be in-
terested

  the machine-gun platoon unlike the
other organizations in the regiment had
no guidon the scarlet-and-white silken
flag carried at the head of each troop

  sergeant turnbull this outfit has to
have a guidon he announced to the
dusky first sergeant

  yas sah yas sah lieutenant dis ere
platoon would be powerful pleased with a
guidon the old man nodded his head
enthusiastically from the sergeants
joy davies figured that the possession of
a guidon would have a good effect on the
morale of the outfit but he had even
deeper plans in mind

  the purchase of some scarlet and white
silk and the sewing of a chino tailor in-
sured the guidon proudly sporting the
neat letters m g t a brass-tipped staff
was salvaged from somewhere

  the platoon was lined up ready for
drill one morning davies carried the
guidon out and showed it to the highly
delighted men they wanted to take it
out to drill immediately but davies
shook his head

  this wont be used today he in-
formed them one week from today
im going to have a competitive drill be-
tween the four squads the one that


malcolm wheeler-nicholson

comes out best will be allowed to carry
the guidon for one week thereafter

  the men nodded seriously each squad
eyeing the members of the other
squads studying them and their possi-
bilities they were undoubtedly inter-
ested in the proposition it was a sport-
ing thing it gave them something definite
for which to work the guidon auto-
matically became a symbol of excellence
much as that little bit of white-starred
blue ribbon and metal called the medal of
honor is a symbol of bravery

  but that isnt all went on davies
the squad that wins wont have any
kitchen police or stable police to do for
a whole week

  grins of delight appeared on the faces
of the men as this news sank in this
was something like no washing dishes
or peeling potatoes or cleaning picket lines
or wrestling with bales of hay and sacks
of grain for a whole week

  of course somebody will have to do
that extra work continued their officer
and well let the squad that makes the
poorest record for the week carry the
burden now anybody that does any
foolishness like going absent without
leave or raising cain in any other way will
have his sins checked up against his
squad when he gets back and finds that
hes put his friends in wrong and made
them do most of the dirty work for the
platoon for a week hes not going to be
very happy

  it was several minutes before the dia-
bolical potentialities of the new plan
dawned on the men when it did they
were startled into feflective silence but
when their minds finally grasped it they
grew jubilant it certainly was going to
make things hum around that platoon

  davies himself was surprized at the
swift change in his organization things
tightened up immediately and auto-
matically his men were throwing them-
selves breathlessly into their work in
one week they were handling the machine-
guns with assured familiarity in two
weeks they had mastered all the drills and
firing commands in the third week they

were beginning to fire the guns accu-
rately

  davies had to make some readjust-
ments before the new system went
smoothly some squads had a surplus
of slower men these had to be distrib-
uted fairly in one case a non-com-
missioned officer slowed up his squad
he was reduced and a keen private
appointed in his stead

  the work had developed into a game
with all the keen competition of a game
money began to change hands on the
outcome of the weekly scores davies
had to correct and iron out attempts at
cheating but his work had grown enorm-
ously more interesting from being the
slave driver of an uninterested group
of plodding soldiers going dispiritedly
through a daily grind he had suddenly
become an umpire judging between four
high-spirited intensely interested teams
of sportsmen

  an order came through from the war
department making the cavalry ma-
chine-gun platoons into full troops and
raising their strength to forty-eight men
but in detailing the new men the order
specified that they were to come from the
regular troops all the scalawags and
goldbricks that the troop commanders
had overlooked before were now thank-
fully detailed to the machine-gun troop

  davies after collecting his new men
from the guardhouse and from absent
without leave looked them over without
much enthusiasm they were not any-
thing to grow happy over

  but they were swiftly caught up in the
new spirit of the new organization in a
week or two they had become so enthusi-
astic that many of them were crowding
the old men for honors

  a little thrill of pride went through
davies as he at last led his new organiza-
tion out mounted its guidon flaunting
proudly at its head it looked like a real
troop at last there was only one fly in
the ointment the new tables of organi-
zation prescribed six machine-guns and the
troop had only four his troop being too
poor to be able to afford a typewriter
the dark regiment



davies had loaned them his own battered
machine

  it happened that this machine was
equipped with a faded purple ribbon
the requisition for the two extra guns and
pack equipment was laboriously made out
on this old wreck of a machine and duly
forwarded davies waited one week
hopefully then two weeks impatiently
but there was no response finally he
hired an automobile and rode to
manila here he found a friend at the
ordnance depot and wheedled the guns
out of him carrying them back with him
in the car

  one month later the requisition came
back it had grown exceedingly in bulk
with some forty added endorsements
the last endorsement was a portentous
and heavy warning to the commanding
officer of the machine-gun troop to refrain
in future from using a purple typewriter
ribbon in making out official documents
there was nothing said about the ma-
chine-guns higher authority had com-
pletely forgotten the benet-merciers in
its horror at the heretical purple-inked
requisition

  but as the two guns in question were
at that very moment being carried out to
drill davies devoted a minimum of time
to remorse over the purple ribbon he
had now six guns and six keen squads of
men to run them the machine-gun
troop barracks hummed like a beehive

  there was no need to discipline the
men the men took care of that them-
selves

  out on the drill and parade grounds the
rest of the regiment went through its
daily routine as it had always done the
soldiers of the nth being men of long
service were not in need of more drill
than was needed to keep men and horses
fit and in shape to take the field and to
keep the regiment up to standard

  life was very pleasant at stotsenburg
regimental baseball got under way the
officers began to develop some excellent
polo the golf and tennis enthusiasts
organized tournaments a great minstrel
show embracing all of the exceptional

talent of the nth cavalry was rehearsing
nightly

one day a sudden rumor began to
coil and eddy around the regiment
men were looking worried officers
shook their heads down at the bache-
lors mess there was gloom and some
trepidation

  for word had come that colonel
timmy phelan had been ordered to take
command of the nth cavalry he was
arriving on the incoming transport due
almost any time now

  timson who on the border had been in
the famous regiment that had suddenly
walked out from under the colonel looked
especially downcast

  whats his specialty he was asked

  his specialty being meaner than a
lone wolf with a sore foot youll learn
things about the regulations that you
never knew existed when that old boy
hits here

  this was depressing

  at last the word came that he had ar-
rived all officers were ordered to head-
quarters to meet the new colonel davies
saw a lean man of middle height and mid-
dle age gray-haired and red-faced with
exceedingly sharp keen blue eyes in
which there rested something like a gleam
of sardonic humor the colonel was ex-
ceedingly energetic pacing back and forth
nervously before the officers as he ad-
dressed them

  officers and soldiers are the laziest
people in gods green earth he opened
his speech and no one pays any atten-
tion to regulations i am in command
here and im going to see that every one
works and that every one follows the regu-
lations thats all gentlemen-good day

  a group of silent and rather stunned
officers filed out davies grinned to him-
self there was something noteworthy
about this terse hard-boiled old bird at
that he certainly didnt waste any
words

  that afternoon davies remembered
some reports that he had to get in and in-
stead of taking his siesta went down to


malcolm wheeler-nicholson

the troop orderly room glancing into
the cool interior of the barracks he saw
his men in shirt-sleeves working at the
guns there seemed to be some sort of a
race going on and there were many
shouts of encouragement

  old sergeant turnbull his first ser-
geant now proudly sporting the diamond
chevrons of his grade saw him enter
the orderly room soon davies heard a
sh-sh go through the squad rooms
the shouting stopped instantly but he
could still hear tense breathing through
the thin reed walls and hear the snip and
click of machine-gun parts being assem-
bled

  there was a step outside on the porch
the door opened without a knock
davies looking up saw the sardonic
blue eyes of colonel timmy phelan re-
garding him

  davies rose swiftly

  how are you colonel he placed a
chair for the newcomer

  whats this outfit barked his guest

  machine-gun troop sir

  hrumph eviden tly colonel timmy
phelan thought little of machine-guns
seems to be the only troop in the regi-
ment doing anything this afternoon he
grunted peevishly every one asleep at
the switch as i expected he glared out
of the window up towards the deserted
parade ground they wont get away
with that very long he growled

  well colonel its pretty hot-
davies started to speak

  hot hot the old mans eyes
flashed angrily what is this-a bunch
of sunday-school teachers or a regiment
ill show them what hot really means be-
fore long

  it was on the tip of davies tongue to
tell the colonel that orders of the philip-
pine department forbade afternoon work
in the tropical sun but he reflected that
it wasnt exactly tactful for a lieutenant
to instruct a colonel on department gen-
eral orders and he kept silent

  the colonel rose

  youve got the neatest looking bar-
racks and stables ive seen in the regi-

ment he growled as if it hurt him to
give any one a compliment and went on
his way

  that night at the bachelor officers
mess there was an innovation finding
that most of the native boys played some
sort of an instrument the mess officer or-
ganized five of them into an orchestra
as the twelve or fourteen bachelors dined
in state the orchestra played away
thrumming out the gay lilt of sera-
phina and the haunting notes of la
paloma and las golandrinas davies
looked around the large table with its
great candles casting a soft light on the
white and gold of the uniforms and con-
sidered that this was much better than
the hot and dusty border with its alkali
and mesquite and its gritty sand

the next day things went on much
as usual but when the trumpet
sounded officers call at one oclock
each officer found a sheaf of papers in his
box dusty and wet with sweat after the
mornings drill the bachelors swarmed to
their mess and took off their grimy khaki
had their shower-baths and gathered
around the table for lunch all of them
clad in the white sleeping kimonos ready
to take their siestas after the meal
sing the chino cook brought in great
platters of ice-cold mangoes with which
they assuaged their thirsts before tack-
ling the lunch

  it was not until then that they started
to read the new orders received at head-
quarters

  good lord exploded timmons the
tall fair-haired lieutenant of g troop
what in the name of all thats holy is
this he read on frowning

  why growled another the colonel
is starting the whole regiment in at re-
cruit drill commencing with paragraph
one and taking to paragraph fifteen for
this week what is the matter with him
these men in the nth have been in the
service for years they dont need re-
cruit drill

  one week learning how to mount and
dismount from a horse how to hold the
the dark regiment



reins how to salute-what the blazes does
he mean

  listen to this read timmons

   at seven-fifteen am all troops in the regi-
   ment will hold instruction in paragraphs one
   to four at eight am all troops will hold in-
   struction in paragraphs five to ten inclusive

  at eight forty-five am-

  but did you see this some one else
shouted at two p m all troops will
hold instruction in the school of the
trooper mounted on the parade ground
-starting with today and it lasts until
four oclock why thats against
orders

  drilling the whole afternoon in the hot
sun

  they looked out of the broad doors of
the bachelor building on to the parade
ground where waves of heat were shim-
mering across its silent expanse a lone
lizard made the furnace-like heat seem
even more desolate by repeating his mon-
otonous cry-gecko gecko gecko but
orders were orders they bolted their
meals hurriedly and silently got back
into khaki again there was no time to
lose

  that afternoon saw the parade ground
filled with dispirited groups of officers and
men listlessly going through the motions
of the school of the trooper the in-
struction designed for recruits a bur-
nished sun poured down its searing rays
from a copper sky every troop was do-
ing the same thing at the same time all
rigidly following the schedule as laid
down in the orders the colonel walked
around watching with eagle eye

  davies could find nothing in the orders
referring to the machine-gun troop this
surprized him somewhat but because
every one else was out working he went
to his own troop and called them out
leading them down to a shady spot close
to the edge of the trees he started a com-
petition between the squads in quick dis-
mounting and going into action it was
so like a game that all the men were
hugely interested and the hours passed
quickly as a matter of fact working

them against a stop-watch he cut down
by three minutes the time it took the
troop to commence firing a very import-
ant matter when three minutes might
mean the loss of many lives

  after this workout stables followed
naturally the second time within the
same day and the horses and mules had
to be groomed again no easy task in the
heat

  a group of thoroughly tired officers as-
sembled again that evening at the mess
the music from the native orchestra
started up

  oh cut out that infernal racket
timmson shouted irritably and the native
boys filed out without a sound

  the meal was eaten in silence most of
the officers already showed lines of strain
under their eyes

  davies taking a stroll after dinner
missed the cheerful music and laughter
from the barracks all was a quiet and
brooding there

  a singing nigger is a happy nigger
he quoted to himself and a silent nigger
is none too safe

  he studied the long line of soldiers bar-
racks with thei hundreds of dusky
troopers-over a thousand men-and
contrasted it with the homes of the forty
or fifty white officers and their families
negro troops had mutinied before in the
philippines and shot their officers and
this lonely camp stotsenburg set here in
the wilds of pampanga was a long way
from civilization

dull and wearisome days succeeded
each other by taking all initiative
from the officers and minutely prescribing
every movement they would make
throughout the days drills the colonel
succeeded in removing all interest from
their work naturally they had- little
spirit to pass on to the men the men
began to assume that pathetic worried
look which appears on the face of the col-
ored man when hes under a powerful
strain

  davies managed to keep his own men
cheerful under the gruelling sun principally


malcolm wheeler-nicholson

by staying out of it also he had them fired
to a keen pitch of enthusiasm for the ma-
chine-guns and their service interested
men learn quickly and perform well
there had not been a single one of his
men in the guardhouse or absent without
leave fpr as long as ten minutes since he
assumed command

  one afternoon he was putting them
through a tent pitching competition the
colonel rode by and stopped to watch
lie saw forty men drop from their sad-
dles as though shot saw them hit the
ground and rapidly link up their horses
and mules the saddles were off in a
few seconds and lined up against the
guidon suddenly a line of shelter tents
appeared and men were arranging mess
kits and blankets ready for inspection
as each squad was finished its leader
reported the colonel gazed on them
amazed

  thats the hvest troop in the regi-
ment he growled the rest of them
arc all dead from their feet up he rode
away

  but it suddenly came over davies why
the colonel let the machine-gun troop
alone the old man didnt know any-
thing about machine guns and didnt
want to show his ignorance

  saturday afternoon was free it was
then that the baseball practise took place
davies went down to watch his troop
team among the guardhouse birds to
which he had fallen heir he detected symp-
toms of a real pitcher or two and a first
class catcher the men of his troop were
playing in undershirts and breeches and
running shoes

  when do we play the first game of the
regimental series he asked sergeant
turnbull

  next saturday sah lieutenant
turnbull turned a worried eye on the
rough practise

  all right tell the team im going to
bet a whole sockful of cash on them if
they lose i lose if they win i buy them
a complete set of baseball uniforms and
equipment

  sergeant turnbull carried the word to

the players there was a long colloquy

  we sure caint let the lieutenant lose
his money they agreed

  impressed by this several of the older
non-commissioned officers who had been
good baseball men in their day bestirred
themselves and came out to coach there-
after at the close of stables each day
the entire troop turned out the next
saturday they won the first game of the
series davies took one of the non-coms
to manila and together they bought a
bang-up baseball outfit

  the following games found the ma-
chine-gun troop attired in proud uniforms
flaming in purple and yellow so that the
members of all other troop teams in the
regiment sighed mightily and enviously
and the machine-gun troop won con-
sistently and steadily-every game they
played

  the grueling heat of the afternoon drills
began to tell first on the white officers
three dropped out of the bachelors mess
and went to the hospital the doctors
began to shake their heads when the ne-
groes started to go under the major-
doctor in charge of the hospital told
davies one day that over one-eighth of the
enlisted strength of the regiment was on
sick report it is not safe for a man to
be physically depleted in the tropics
there are too many dangerous diseases
lurking in wait ready to fasten them-
selves on his weakened body

  certainly the bachelors mess was no
cheerful place those days dispirited and
weary officers growled dismally at one an-
other when they spoke at all few had
energy left for polo or tennis and dancing
was out altogether even the women of
the regiment began to show the strain of
living with querulous and fault-finding
husbands

  a gloom had settled on the bright spirits
of the nth cavalry among the regular
troops of the regiment quarrels and knif-
ings between the men became more fre-
quent the trouble with negro fights is
that they generally end in casualties of a
serious nature one duel with knives in
b troop ended fatally there was a quick
the dark regiment



court martial of the survivor he was
sentenced to death

  well have that fellows sentence read
before the entire regiment growled the
colonel maybe it will teach these nig-
gers to think twice before drawing a
knife

  now it happens that there are certain
sympathetic folk who can use the word
nigger and get a smile from the colored
man and there are many who had better
eschew the use of the term in referring to
that somewhat sensitive race the colo-
nel belonged to the latter category the
word spread like wildfire through the regi-
ment and into the eyes of the soldiers
came an inscrutable look the inscrutable
look of the black man when he thinks his
own thoughts and shares them with no
one but his own race

  as ordered the regiment was lined up
the three squadrons forming three sides
of a hollow square into the square
heavily manacled a wild-eyed negro sol-
dier was led the adjutant in a loud and
piercing voice read the mans crime the
regiment listened stolidly a thousand
black faces gazing straight to the front

  and therefore the voice of the adju-
tant rose he is condemned to be hanged
by the neck until dead

  by accident or design the voice of the
adjutant rose to a shout on the last words
through the straight ranks of the thou-
sand black men before him went a quiver
and a strange sound a low moan that
rose gathering volume until it filled the
air like the humming of thousands of an-
gry bees it was an indescribably primi-
tive sound a sound that made the listen-
ers hair rise on the back of his neck the
moaning hum died down the men stood
straight and quiet again gazing stolidly
to the front

  again davies thought of these good-
hearted but exceedingly temperamental
black men subject as they were to sudden
fits of mob passion and he thought of how
simple a thing it wouldbe for them to
rise and overpower their white officers
strangely enough he was not worried
about the damage to the white officers

including himself so much asat the sure
and swift punishment which would over-
take the negro he did not want to see
this fine regiment blotted out when it was
so easy a matter to control these people
and gain their loyal cooperation

davies turn as officer of the day
came around at regular intervals
part of the duties of that office is to take
over the responsibility for the guard the
guardhouse and the inmates of this last
sojourning place every time he went on
duty he checked up the prisoners every
time he went on guard he found the list
steadily mounting

  the average colored soldier unlike
many of his white brothers-in-arms docs
not take the guardhouse as a joke the
roll call ordinarily showed some ten or
twelve men under arrest in the whole regi-
ment but now the total mounted stead-
ily from day to day

  in the third month of colonel timmy
phelans command there were over a hun-
dred men in confinement-an entire
troop of cavalry at war strength nearly
one-twelfth of the combatant strength of
the regiment davies shook his head over
this but could not resist a little thrill of
pride at the knowledge that there was not
a single one of his own men there

  the medical officers were frankly wor-
ried they were responsible for the
health of the command and their personal
efficiency records were being hurt in their
own corps by an exceedingly high sickness
rate nearly one-fourth of the regiment
officers and mien were now on sick report

  davies began to dislike dining at the
bachelor officers mess so lined and
weary-looking were the faces of the young
officers so irritable were their occasional
remarks that it always seemed as if they
were on the verge of an explosion

  from the colonels headquarters poured
a steady stream of orders new recruits
came instead of including their training
in the regular drill hours the colonel de-
cided that they must be handled out of
hours so as not to interfere with the regu-
lar training of the regiment


malcolm wheeler-nicholson

  after a few more days of this extra
strain captain poinsett keeled over on the
drill ground and was sent to the hospital
to begin a long series of travels in search
of lost health travels which were to cul-
minate six months later in his retirement
from the army for physical disability
young lieutenant alexander began to act
queerly one day suddenly rushing to his
quarters he came back with his pistol
his face wore a cunning look

  theres a man in this regiment trying
to kill me he whispered and im going
to get him

  he strode away over the parade ground
his pistol cocked and ready he was sub-
dued luckily before he did any harm on
the surgeons recommendation he was
sent away and a few months later was
retired as physically and mentally dis-
abled

  poor hurd as fine a physical specimen
as one could find among the officers of the
whole army tried doggedly to carry out
every order given to him with the result
that he went the way of the rest and
when last heard of was a regular inmate
of military hospitals in which he under-
went an operation twice or thrice a year
for intestinal trouble brought on by over-
work in the tropics

  the colonel spent most of his time these
days ragging the recruits much in the
manner that a yearling rags a plebe at
west point he followed them about
keeping up a steady fire of comment and
criticism at their awkwardness davies
passing by unseen one day heard one of
the bewildered darkies ask another-
who dat white man wid de chickens
on his shoulders

  why boy was the answer dat dere
is the colonel o dish here regiment
zat so the first one shook his head
mournfully then with a sigh well he
sure is powerful cruel and the two re-
turned resignedly to their tasks

  the one bright spot in the week was
the negro church on sunday davies
used to attend regularly in the first place
because he liked to hear the oratory of the
negro chaplain an earnest and eloquent

exhorter for the lord with a gift for
colorful imagery and in the second place
because the negro spirituals were beauti-
fully sung by the rich musical voices of the
nth cavalry troopers he noticed a
vague change in the spirit of these songs

  where formerly their voices had risen
exultantly in such triumphant chants as
all gods chillen got shoes and
lordy im glad i got my religion in
time they now seemed to be partial to
more plaintive lays and crooned out
oh lordy wont you hear me
prayin and oh mary dont you
weep dont you moan with all the
tuneful pathos of which their race is
capable

in davies troop things went along
smoothly enough the colonel still
neglected to lay his blighting hand on the
activities of this organization davies
was enjoying his work hugely and natu-
rally enough communicating his keen
pleasure to his men his system of com-
petitive try-outs was slowly but surely
showing up the strong and weak members
of his non-commissioned personnel very
quietly he moved for the reduction of a
few hopelessly inept ones and for the pro-
motion of capable juniors the men all
realized the justice of his moves for the
record of each corporal and sergeant was
there for all men to see in the records of
the performance of his squad

  he learned one lesson however when
it came to old sergeant scotter here
was one sergeant that had all the ear-
marks of a splendid non-commissioned
officer sergeant scotter had the reddish-
tinged skin and the sharper features of
the warrior bambara he had the ability
to handle men but would not or could not
make his squad win

  sergeant scotter was undoubtedly fall-
ing down on the job his men were not
up to scratch he was losing steadily in
the competitions before breaking the
old man davies cclled sergeant turnbull
into conference

  yas sah lieutenant- sergeant
turnbulls dusky face grew grave-dat
the dark regiment



dere sam scotter is havin domestic try-
try-biliations yes sah he shore is afflis-
cated wid infelicity and unharmony in his
matrimonial relations

  in other words his wife is giving him
hell

  yas sah yas sah his wife done fill
his life wid mournful cogitations dat dere
woman am sure a powerful disturbance to
tranquility

  calling in sergeant scotter davies
asked him frankly about his troubles
the old man would give nothing but eva-
sive answers and the interview revealed
nothing

  but that evening as davies was resting
on his bed under his mosquito bar trying
to read in spite of the heat his boy an-
nounced a soldier to see him putting on
kimono and grass slippers davies went
out to his sitting room sergeant scotter
was ushered in turning his hat awk-
wardly in his hands

  yas sah lieutenant the lieutenant
knows maybe ahs been havin difficulties
wid my wife its all on account o that
there woman that ahs powerful low in my
mind sah lieutenant and there was
something pathetic and wistful in the old
fellows eyes

  is she much younger than you ser-
geant asked the white man gently

  yas sah lieutenant shes mighty
young and mighty flossy all de time
trapesin around wid dese here young
buck niggers and showin no respect for
mah rank and position in de regiment
ah done married dat girl when i was home
on furlough she want nothin but a
cotton-pickin nigger-yas sah lieu-
tenant she didnt have nothin why
sah a dollar in dat girls pocket would a
rattled like a mule in a tin barn yas sah
lieutenant

  the old man wagged his head sadly
davies looked the other way suddenly
the old man went on-

  sah lieutenant ah done raised dat
girl from a lowly estate and it appears lak
its done gone to her haid he shook his
head again and then relapsed into a
silence

    

  now for a cotton-pickin nigger to
marry a sergeant was a big lift in the
colored social scale for a colored sergeant
in the army ranks even higher than
a pullman porter while as every one
knows a pullman porter is perched on a
serene social height

  it appeared on investigation that the
lady in question was waiting at the back
door she was called in a little proud at
this solemn conclave assembled in her
honor davies talked to her gently tell-
ing her how she was hurting her husbands
chances and he ended up with a promise
to aid the husband in getting a divorce
and having her returned to her cotton-
picking if she didnt mend her ways

  strangely enough this rough form of
tribal justice worked like a charm there-
after sergeant scotter took heart of
grace and fell into his work with enthu-
siasm but the word went forth-and
this family conference was the forerunner
of many thereafter men from other
troops coming with their troubles until
davies knew all the strange undercurrents
of colored family life in the regiment and
unraveled many entanglements which
these black folk brought to him

  the same rough sort of justice worked
well enough in the troop the black man
is given to strange fits of gusty and cause-
less passion passion aroused seemingly
over a mere trifle

  it was a lamentable fact that most of
these storms were decided in the machine-
gun troop with the aid of the sharp ma-
chete issued to machine-gunners learn-
ing this early in the game davies had the
keen edges of these weapons ground down
so that at the worst they could do no
more than leave a lively bruise

  one of these sudden flare-ups occurred
on the picket-line one sultry afternoon
the two culprits were brought before him
ranged on either side by a portentous
first sergeant and a solemn stable ser-
geant

  what started the riot davies asked

  sah lieutenant dis here fellow done
called me a lazy black nigger

  davies looked him over quizzically


malcolm wheeler-nicholsox

  well arent you lazy he drawled
the soldiers strained and angry face
relaxed

  if de lieutenant says ah is ah reckons
ah is he agreed mildly enough

  well arent you black

  yas sah ah reckons ahs kinda dark
at that he grinned

  well arent you a nigger

  yas sah if de lieutenant says ah is
ah reckons ah is

  by this time both the soldiers were
grinning broadly their rancor forgotten

  well get out of here and dont bother
me if you do any more fighting ill have
you skinned alive and boiled in oil

  both men left hugely delighted davies
worked on the principle right or wrong
that it never does any good to take the
colored mans frequent minor falls from
grace with too much seriousness

rihe finals of the regimental base-
s- ball league were played off the
machine-gun troop won the regimental
silver cup and the great banner davies
was pleased as punch knowing full well
that a decided victory in anything is one
of the most important steps in making a
mob of men into an organization

  shortly thereafter a regimental inspec-
tion in full pack was ordered by the colo-
nel the order came to pitch tents
almost before the rest of the regiment had
started the machine-gun troop had fin-
ished standing by its completed camp
ready and waiting for the inspection which
followed the colonel stared at this

  turning to the adjutant in plain hearing
of the troop he announced authoritively-
this machine-gun troop is the best
organization in the regiment

  a quiver of pride went through the
waiting troop white eyeballs rolled
ecstatically

its too bad the colonel went on as
lie dismounted to inspect that a ma-
chine-gun troop is of no tactical value
how do you mean colonel davies
looked up astonished

  its no good for cavalry why i
could take a squadron of cavalry and

charge you off your feet before you could
get your guns into action

  id like to take you up on that colo-
nel davies said respectfully

  the colonel bored into him with his
harsh blue eyes but said nothing

  id like your permission to arrange a
firing test that will prove how quickly
we can get into action and what we can
do after wre get in davies went on
steadily

  all right the colonel waved his hand
carelessly make your plans and well
see and he walked through inspecting
the mens equipment

  davies watched the men narrowly as
the colonel stopped by each pup-tent and
examined the two soldiers stiffly at at-
tention before it again he noticed that
brooding mysterious look that comes into
the colored mans eyes when he is con-
fronted by the white man who is out of
sympathy with him

  and davies knew that there was an en-
tire regiment of colored men who pos-
sessed a mass dislike for this colonel
a mass dislike that could easily be fanned
into a sudden overpowering flame of
hatred that might do great damage be-
fore it was put out for the regiment was
steadily deteriorating the score of sick
had grown until now there was almost a
third of the strength of the nth cavalry
on sick report this would not have
aroused the hatred of the negroes it
was the colonels reasons for this state of
affairs that set them stubbornly against
him

  these lazy black boys would rather
go to the hospital than work commented
timmy phelan unfortunately within
hearing of one of the black men aforesaid

  and of course it was all over the regi-
ment in half an hour and a strange
anger all the more dangerous for being
repressed seethed in the breasts of the
black soldiers

hat in blazes makes those men of
yours sing all the time tim-
monsasked irritablyat dinnerthatevening
they are going around like a dizzy bunch
the dark regiment



of canaries i heard them singing at
stables this morning who ever heard of
a nigger singing at stables

  his question was posed insultingly and
his voice was harsh davies started to
resent the tone then remembered the
strain under which every one was laboring
and replied mildly

  oh its just a fad of mine i like to
hear darkies sing lord knows if they
can get any joy out of life these days
theyre welcome to it

  other heads nodded at the table

  i havent heard a song from my out-
fit in so long that i think theyve forgotten
how they go round mumbling to them-
selves i dont like that much confessed
stanwick who had a troop down in the
first squadron

  but what are you doing over there in
your machine-gun troop anyway my
man curtin whos one of the best pitch-
ers in the regiment is trying to transfer
to your outfit

  search me shrugged davies i
didnt seduce him

  well it doesnt make much difference
anyway my men havent got enough
heart left to play baseball any more all
they do is go around mumbling to them-
selves and shaking their heads theyre
absolutely depressing

  if the old man keeps me out on that
parade ground many more of these hot
afternoons ill do worse than mumble
growled hastings who commanded a
platoon in troop m of the third squadron
ill go around picking things out of
the air and singing-tweet-tweet-im
cuckoo 

  speaking of being cuckoo have any
of you seen bunny featherstone lately
bunny featherstone was the regimental-
ordnance - quartermaster - police - every-
thing - else officer

  no whats his trouble

  hes got a queer look in his eyes
came up to me at drill today said he
was thinking of nothing but bumping
himself off dreamed of it every night
and thought of it all day said he was
afraid of himself

  the hell you say hes got an awfully
sweet little wife and a brace of kids
that would be a shame

  i tried to soothe him down but he
went away with his hands crossed behind
him and his fingers curling and uncurling
like a plateful of snakes theyd better
watch that baby or hell up and shoot
himself

  there was a long silence broken finally
by hastings voice-

heres to the dead already-

hurrah for the next who dies

  he quoted the song most brutally

  good old army where they have crazy
colonels running around commanding
thousands of men did you ever notice
the back of the old boys head there
isnt any he wears cap size about
five and half never saw a man with-
out any back to his head that was
normal

  but why in the name of sin doesnt
some one tell them about him down at
department headquarters asked young
webly newly arrived and a very short
time in the service

  there was a long and pregnant silence
finally some one spoke up

  yeah nice business junior officers
complaining of a senior department
headquarters would reward you by throw-
ing you out on your left ear and turning
you over to the colonel for disciplinary
action no thanks ill stick to the
troubles i know rather than fly to those
i wot not of-which shakespeare or
somebody got off a few thousand years
ago

  well hastings grumbled reflectively
if i have to put those men of mine
through recruit drill many weeks longer
theyre just naturally going to blow up
and there will be an explosion that will
shake up department headquarters

  do you really think the men would
mut-would raise cain young webly
avoided the dread word but his eyes
were round and serious

  there was a silence for a space no
one looked at him finally hastings rose


malcolm wheeler-nicholson

and yawned and went out singing softly
to himself

        aint been long in this here army

        mighty short time since i arrived

        guess i like it better than a-farming-
        aint no cows for to milk or drive

davies went to his quarters to work
out a very interesting problem if
a squadron of cavalry at a gallop can
cover so many yards in so many seconds
in how many seconds is it necessary for a
machine-gun troop to unlimber and com-
mence firing in time to stop the charge
as he worked it out he figured that a
machine-gun outfit that could come into
action in twenty seconds from the time
the cavalry was started could break up a
cavalry charge

  the next morning he timed his men
with a stop-watch they dropped from
the horses unlimbered their guns and
commenced firing in twenty-five seconds
he shook his head theyd have to do
better than that he told them why

  the next day they cut the time down to
eighteen seconds that was better
they seemed to have no difficulty in
keeping around this figure which was a
safe enough margin

  he stopped in to see the colonel

  with your permission sir ill have
disappearing targets placed on the b
range in three successive lines the targets
to appear at intervals representing the
approach of a squadron of cavalry at
charging speed i think i can prove to
you that ill stop them with my guns

  the colonel laughed skeptically

  all right ill be there with all the
officers of the regiment to show them how
wrong it is to place dependence in those
toys of yours tomorrow afternoon on
the range at four and ill have the tar-
gets put up myself so that you wont
know from which direction the attack is
coming the colonels harsh blue eyes
glared suspiciously

  fair enough agreed davies

  luckily his men were skilled at firing
the guns he had insisted in firing them
on the range at least once a week both

with single shots and with bursts of fire
they had become very proud of their
ability to hit with these complicated little
air-cooled benet-merciers

rtvhat afternoon there was the sound
a of pistol shots coming from down on
the officers line davies crossing the
parade ground saw people running to-
ward bunny featherstones house he
followed a crowd of officers and soldiers
suddenly ran back towards him

  look out hes shooting

  he heard a shot and saw a leaf flicked
off from the tree overhead

  bunny is barricaded in his house we
dont know whether hes killed his wife
and children yet but hes gone staring
crazy hastings panted beside him

  maybe i can talk to him davies
said easily

  youll get riddled full of holes
hastings called after

  but davies walked very calmly down
the deserted sidewalk and up the steps
of bunnys house all was silent he
tried the door it gave to his hand
entering he saw bunny waving a pistol
around in his hand leaning dizzily
against the dining-room door

  what the hell is the matter with you
bunny he called his voice very matter
of fact

  the man with the pistol turned around
and peered at him craftily

 put that gun down bunny com-
manded davies firmly he walked up with
outstretched hand at the same time

  bunny continued to stare at him with-
out a word then very wearily he
handed the gun over

  my head feels funny he whimpered
and slumping down began to cry like
a child

  davies left him there and made a quick
survey of the house to see whether he had
shot wife and children he found mrs
featherstone in the kitchen with her chil-
dren crying hysterically bunny had
threatened them but had gone out first
to drive away the invaders

  oh that horrible colonel moaned
the dark regiment



mrs featherstone a pretty little blond
woman whose normally rosy cheeks were
pale and streaming with tears it is all his
fault now bunny has gone crazy
what shall i do what shall i do

  and he had gone crazy from that day
on he recognized no one and spoke no
word of sense he was sent back to the
states under guard on the next transport
to spend the rest of his short life in st
elizabeth the army insane asylum at
washington

the next afternoon davies led his
troop out on the b range north of
the post the b range is the target range
for unknown distances as opposed to the
a range where distances are known
the adjutant met him at the edge of the
range

  the colonel directs that you march
along this road until you sight the enemy
cavalry and thereafter take such action
as seems fitting a pistol-shot will warn
you of the start of the cavalry charge
against your troop

  telling his men to keep eyes and ears
open davies gave the signal-

  forward-march

  behind him the silken guidon snapped
in the breeze the first squad with its
two mules one carrying the machine-gun
and the other the extra ammunition
was at his heels followed at regular in-
tervals by the other five squads

  up on a slight hill to the right he could
see a group of officers with field glasses
among them the colonel somewhere
along this stretch of road the machine-
guns would be jumped by a hypothetical
squadron of cavalry represented by lines
of cardboard silhouettes of men and
horses he hoped his men would keep
their wits about them

  the plain rolled up away from him to
the left of the road there was naught
discernible in the kogan grass suddenly
he heard a shot

  it was to the left without looking he
signaled fight on foot and leaped from
his horse

  there on the plain at a few hundred

yards distance had suddenly appeared
a long line of targets

  his men were boiling on the road be-
fore he had time to give a signal he heard
a burst of shots from the nearest gun it
was followed by the staccato rattle of the
other five guns

  fountains of dust were raised before
and behind the line of targets suddenly
that set of silhouettes dropped into the
kogan grass one hundred and fifty yards
nearer appeared another long line the
time was so regulated as to simulate the
rapid approach of a squadron of cavalry
at the gallop  without command the
fire of the guns was trained on the new
objective clouds of dust rose about the
pasteboard figures

  suddenly one end of the line of targets
began to droop and the entire row fell
over so intense was the fire that the
targets had been shot through and
through and the guy ropes cut by the hail
of bullets

  but another row this time close at
hand rose up suddenly a terrific fire
was directed on these they began to
drop and they fell in the same manner
a whistle blew cease firing davies
signaled

  the colonel rode up a stop-watch in his
hand he was engaged in low-voiced
conversation with major ladrew the
two gazed curiously at davies and his
waiting troop the colonel seemed dis-
pleased without a word he rode over to
examine the targets major ladrew
lagged behind he leaned down swiftly
from the saddle

  son his eyes twinkled youve
broken a worlds record you went into
action in twelve and two-fifth seconds
i have been watching your work with that
gang of jail-birds you had wished on you
in the machine-gun troop congratula-
tions 

  and he rode on leaving davies in a fine
glow

  fine work he called to the anxious-
eyed men you have done wonders you
went into action in twelve and two-fifths
seconds his voice rang exultantly


malcolm wheeler-nicholson

why damn your worthless hides youve
broken a worlds record

  it was cruel to keep men at attention in
the face of such news

  rest davies called to them

  an excited babble of voices and happy
laughter broke out but it was hushed as
the colonel and major ladrew came riding
back the colonel looked if anything
more displeased than ever

  well he grunted unamiably you
seem to have hit a few targets and he
rode back to the waiting group of officers
on the hillside

 major ladrew gazed after him a curious
look in his eyes then he turned to
davies

  you cleaned up son he said the
targets are all torn to pieces your fire
was accurate and your distribution almost
perfect had that been a real squadron
of cavalry they woidd have been massa-
cred more power to your elbow young
fellow and ladrew leaned down and
grasped davies hand in a hearty grip
then rejoined the colonel

hphe colonel thereafter made no
- reference to the feat he preserved
a deep silence on the whole affair as is
usual in the regular army no official
mention whatsoever was made of the
breaking of this record although the
facts found their way into the papers and
into the military journals of other armies
weeks later major ladrew came to
davies with a cablegram in his hand

  it was signed by a very famous ex-
president now dead it asked major
ladrew for recommendations for three
army officers to act as majors in a regi-
ment which the then ex-president con-
templated raising for service in mexico

  i have cabled your name said major
ladrew quietly as one of the three livest
junior officers i have ever met anybody
who can take a gang made up of guard-
house cast-offs from other troops and
break a worlds record in three months is a
real leader

  the word of the machine-gun troops
prowess spread all over the regiment

incredulous troopers went out on foot to
look over the torn and mangled targets
a lively and wholesome respect for ma-
chine-gun fire entered into the souls of
those men and as for the men in the
machine-gun troop-they had long since
assumed an air of galling superiority but
now they became totally oblivious of
the very existence of the rest of the
regiment

  applications for transfer to this outfit
began to pour in on regimental head-
quarters from men in the other troops of
the regiment the greatest threat that
could be made to a member of the ma-
chine-gun troop was a warning that he
would be transferred back to the line

  the orphan outfit despised and re-
jected had really become the corps delite
of the regiment shortly after an order
came through from the war department
increasing the strength of the machine-
gun troop of a regiment of cavalry from
forty-eight to seventy-eight men in
other words it had been brought up to
the peace strength of a regular troop of
cavalry

  davies sighed when he saw the order
it meant the beginning of the end it
was no longer a lieutenants command
he would soon lose command and a cap-
tain would be appointed to reap where he
had sown

  some daring soul must have made a
complaint of the extremely demoralized
state of the regiment for an inspector
dropped in one day from manila this
inspector-general was a dry bespectacled
wisp of a man who was immediately im-
pressed by colonel timmy phelans
evident anxiety to follow every single one
of the regulations issued by a war de-
partment unusually given to voluminous
legislating the inspecting officer sedu-
lously avoided questioning any officers or
men

  he left after twenty-four hours and
evidently turned in a very favorable re-
port on colonel phelan thereafter it
was observed that one of the majors in
the regiment began to wear a harassed
and hunted look it was not long before
the dark regiment



he was ordered to manila to appear be-
fore a court martial on some charges that
had nothing absolutely nothing to do
with his having told the truth about the
incapacity of a colonel who was command-
ing a regiment of cavalry at camp
stotsenburg

  the men began to show signs of the
strain that they were under their eyes
were sunk far back in their heads giving
them a look of absolute dejection there
were no more dances in the mens quarters
the nights at stotsenburg were still and
silent with no sound of happy laughter
rising nor any note of music

  another incident occurred to deepen
the growing sullenness of the men out
on the great drill ground the regiment
worked by troops and squadrons the
colonel coming out one day upbraided
several officers for the lack of life in their
drilling riding along at the side of one
troop he scolded and growled until the
troop commander was nearly desperate

  now get your men in line and let me
see you charge down that strip through
the woods and for gods sake get some
life into it

  but colonel the natives have the
ground down there dug up with grass-
hopper pits- the officer started to
expostulate

  grasshopper pits are trenches dug
across trails and open spaces long and
narrow pits not over eight inches wide
and several feet deep made for the purpose
of trapping the great swarms of locusts
which the natives use for food these
pits are concealed in the tall grass and
constitute an ever-present danger for
horse and rider

  what do you mean by disputing my
order shouted the colonel move out
immediately-grasshopper pits what
next he snorted angrily

  the officer obeyed grimly riding at the
head of that swiftly galloping troop
straight into the treacherous ground
four horses went down two had to be
shot immediately one rider had his arm
broken one was bruised badly two of
the black soldiers lay still and silent

their necks broken the colonel looked
them over calmly

 you cant make omelets without
breaking eggs he commented there
are plenty of these- he pointed con-
temptuously at the two silent figures-
there are plenty of these left

  as the colonel rode away a low growl
rose up from the troop a growl almost
animal-like in its throbbing intensity
the white-faced officer mounted wearily
to his saddle and followed the ambulance
in his troop riding silent ominously
silent behind him

  orders came for the regiment to take
the field on maneuvers a little life in-
stilled itself into the dejected officers and
men it was a relief anyway from the
unvarying daily grind of following page
and paragraph of drill regulations

  they went north to capas where the
colonel started what ho called maneuvers
the officers soon found that these move-
ments were afflicted with the same species
of dry rot that deadened the daily drills
every movement was done by rote and
line there was no initiative left to
officers and men troops were ordered to
march to certain points

  once there their orders were laid down
strictly covering every step at the end
of each day the colonel held what he
called a critique he always managed to
find the hottest and most steaming spot
in the landscape in which to hold these

  his favorite gathering place was a small
clearing in the dank kogan grass the
height of which effectually kept out any
wandering breath of air so that officers
were steaming moist and bathed in sweat
through a weary hour of harangue and
scolding

finally some staff officers came up
from manila and set the colonel a
problem to do to illustrate how he could
handle the regiment on campaign
throughout one hot afternoon officers
and men were sent hither and yon up hill
and down mounted and dismounted
there was some dim idea that they were
engaged in holding a river-crossing in the
malcolm wheeler-nicholson

rear of a retreating army but no one know
what it was all about

  at the end of the exercises the umpires
held a critique one of them an ex-
tremely austere gray-haired colonel
waited until the last

  colonel he began easily the method
you used today was exactly the same
means used by colonel distchenko com-
manding a regiment of dragoons in the
russo-japanese war i might say that
you duplicated his every move with re-
markable fidelity

  colonel timmy phelan looked around
the group of officers with something like
pride in his eyes he nodded trying to
look modest and motioned for the um-
pire to go on

  the gray-haired critic cleared his voice

  i will have to add however that the
worthy colonel distchenko lost his entire
regiment to a man and was himself
killed

  the colonel glared in astonishment
then as the full import of the words
struck him his face burned a deep angry
red but the umpire went on pitilessly
telling him how his whole conception of
the problem was faulty from the begin-
ning by the time he was finished there
was not an officer in the regiment who
had not seen that the colonel was as mad
as a turkey-cock

  and naturally enough he took it out
on the poor old nth the regimental
maneuver finished the campaign boots
and saddles rang out from the trumpet-
ers the colonel fell in at the head of the
regiment mounted on a powerful long-
legged gray horse without looking be-
hind him he ordered thfe forward march

  davies riding in the rear of the regi-
ment with his troop suddenly lost touch
with the squadron in front of him he
gazed ahead worried the regiment had
disappeared from view he was going
along at a smooth and even gait the regu-
lation trot for cavalry and the fastest pace
at which cavalry can cover many miles
and still come in unscathed and fit for the
next days march or for battle

  he made what time he could by short-

ening his rest periods and by increasing
his trotting time over his walking time
but he had some twenty kilometers still
to cover and he had to bring his animals
in free from saddle galls 

  as it was he dismounted before his
troop stables late that night the others
of the regiment were already finished with
their grooming after seeing to his men
and animals he repaired to the bachelors
mess for something to eat all the officers
were there a scowling indignant bunch

  what happened davies inquired

  what happened growled haskins
why the crazy old fool trotted about
ten miles an hour the entire distance
most of my horses galloped the twenty
kilometers i lost five horses ive got
something like twenty horses with saddle
sores so big that you couldnt cover them
with a shelter half

  the toll of the other troops was the
same now if there is one thing that is a
tradition and an excellent one in the
american cavalry it is the heritage of
good marching-a heritage from old
indian-fighting days when six-hundred
mile hikes were the usual thing an
american cavalry officer would feel dis-
graced and apologetic if one saddle sore
appeared among seventy horses after a
weeks steady marching

  colonel timmy phelan as a cavalry-
man had sunk so low in the estimation of
his regiment that there was no hope of his
ever retrieving his reputation

  and the worst of it is haskins went
onthat the war department rates him as
a very fine officer no one in the war
department will ever know how hes
butchered a fine regiment of cavalry
way out here in the philippine islands
they are not interested in such details

  even the colonel must have noticed
the hostility of men and officers the day
following for he began to look a little
apprehensive but not for long he was
of the type that glories in enmity did
an entire regiment hate him whole-
heartedly he began really to feel that he
had been a great success as a commanding
officer
the dark regiment



the rainy season was about due
the low muttering sullenness that
precedes it filled the air and depressed
mens spirits they faced weeks of
steady downpour alternated by fierce
heat which filled the air with steam
leather boots or belts covered themselves
overnight with mildew the dank humid-
ity covered ones skin with prickly heat
and filled ones soul with irritation it
is a time to try mens souls

  a boxing bout was arranged by the
athletic officer owing to the lowering
skies it was held in the great post gym-
nasium davies went in company with
the other officers the regimental ath-
letic officer was a tall frowning new
englander arkwright did not like ne-
groes he made no bones of his distaste
for the men and their race

  now there is no one keener to sense dis-
like for his race than is a negro

  arkwright was especially irritable that
night the great gymnasium was filled
with solemn black faces staring at him
several of the most promising fighters
had failed to show up the boxing match
was delayed for half an hour the colonel
sitting up in the balcony had called to
him several times

  finally the first two fighters came on
they were two long lanky yellow ne-
groes a steady pattering of rain on the
roof deepened to the roar of the first
tropical downpour men were uneasy
the air was charged with electricity and
with the rumble and roar of cataclysmic
thunderings

  it was obvious from the first blow ex-
changed by the two negroes that their
hearts were not in the fighting they
leaned into each others arms through the
first round and softly tapped away as if
in mortal terror of bruising each other
with an unkind smack

  arkwright was refereeing at the con-
clusion of the first round he went up to
each corner and remonstrated with the
men his face was flushed they looked
sullen the bell rang

  up they got and gingerly approached
each other hoots and calls echoed from

the soldiers the two clinched the
officer broke them apart roughly-a little
too roughly for a silence fell upon the
watching negroes

  again they approached each other
one reached out and gently tapped the
other on his chin the man who had
been touched threw up his arms theatri-
cally and sank to the floor hoots of
derision and cat-calls filled the air

  arkwright counted ten the man still
lay supine the referees eyes blazed
with anger walking over to the prone
negro the white officer deliberately kicked
him

  davies watching tensely heard a sigh
go up from the thousand negroes who
filled the hall then all was silence
outside the noise of the storm continued
inside every one sat as if carved in stone

 suddenly as if the same thought
flashed through every negros head there
was the rumble of a thousand chairs being
moved the men had risen a low angry
muttering filled the air-a hum as of
an immense angry hive of bees dis-
turbed and vengeful it was an ominous
sound a sound that once heard could
never be forgotten a sound to send cold
shivers up the spine

  the colonel rose from his seat in the
balcony davies looked at him worried
it only needed a spark to start something

  get back to your seats you men
bellowed timmy phelan angrily

  the soldiers passing underneath the
balcony raised their eyes to his what he
saw there made the colonels face turn
pale

  an angry roar suddenly filled the hall
davies heard the word-

  kill

  in the rear of the mass pouring out of
the building davies suddenly saw old
sergeant turnbull and fifteen or twenty
men of the machine-gun troop rushing
down the narrow steps he jumped among
them just as they were about to leave

  men he called sharply sergeant
turnbull

  his men paused uncertainly in their
eyes was a queer drugged look as if


malcolm wheeler-nic holson

they were walking in their sleep again
he called this time dawning recognition
came into their eyes he seemed to have
awakened them at last

  listen you men of the corps d elite the
rest of the regiment is likely to do some-
thing foolish its up to us to stop it we
cant have all these black boys getting
mixed up in any foolishness we are the
brains of the regiment weve got to stop
it

  they were beginning to nod in con-
firmation of his words now was the
time-or never

  listen each one of you is worth
twenty men the rest of the regiment is
afraid of the machine-guns well run a
bluff on them for their own good you
sergeant scotter take ten men double-
quick to the barracks and bring up the
guns sergeant turnbull and i will
follow the crowd and try to talk some
sense into them

  still they were a little uncertain

  come on its our lieutenant talkin
the lieutenant of the finest troop in the
army bellowed sergeant scotter sud-
denly

 their wavering was over swiftly
they followed the sergeant

davies went out into the storm with
sergeant turnbull and the few men
remaining with him far ahead he could
hear the angry hum of a thousand voices
if only scotter would be on time

  hurrying through the night he came
up to the outer edges of the crowd
they were grouped in a black mass
swaying back and forth and muttering
the rain had stopped a fitful ray
of moonlight made things partially
visible

  from the direction of the barracks he
could see a group of men hurrying to-
ward his white uniform they were
carrying something as they came
nearer he recognized his machine-guns

  near-by was a stout wooden hurdle
used for schooling the horses over the
jumps davies leaped upon this he
filled his lungs

  attention he shouted with every
ounce of energy he could command

  black heads were raised swiftly at the
familiar word a silence fell over the
assembly all eyes were fixed on the
white uniform of the officer seen dimly
through the gloom a low growl went
up again davies heard that word-
kill

  turning davies shouted out the com-
mands for machine-gun fire

 action front- load he com-
manded

  there was the harsh rattle of magazines
being inserted in the guns a whisper
went up and traveled swiftly through the
crowd machine-guns

  some memory of those torn and riddled
targets must have come to them

  silence shouted davies his voice
clear and steady and vibrating with au-
thority come to attention

  the men before him sensed the ring of
command they waited silent

  there will be no more foolishness
went on davies in the silence whats
the matter with you men anyway he
scolded in that resolute but kindly voice
that so many of the negroes knew the
machine-gun troop is right here to stop
any silly moves made by a lot of recruits
among you i want you old soldiers to
get a grip on yourselves you are acting
like children if one white man acts
foolishly is that any reason for you to act
still more foolishly dont be children
davies laughed suddenly

  do you men think that all the foolish
men are in your race cant you let us
have one or two foolish white men of our
own without getting so uppity about it
a silence followed this for a second
then a chuckle went up from near-by
it was followed by a general chuckle and
then a laugh went through the black mass
of men before him davies wiped his
forehead he found his hand trembling
strangely but the crisis was over he
had won them

  now you run along back to your
barracks and forget your sore heads he
concluded
the dark regiment



  there was a great shuffling and stamp-
ing of feet

  yas yas dats lieutenant davies-
he sure is right plumb lot of foolishness
sure enough dese here young soldiers is
gettin too uppity yas yas

  davies heard the voices disappearing
off in the darkness and the shuffle of
many feet on the barracks porches

 and that was how a mutiny was
averted in the nth cavalry a mutiny
that had it gone through would have
resulted in untold deaths and misery and
the eventual blotting out of an entire
regiment of splendid colored soldiers
for had they killed their officers in their
blind craze of slaughter they would most
certainly have been hunted and harried
and shot down like dogs by the other
troops in the islands and would have been
a blot on the name of their race for all
time

  a few days later orders came for davies
to make a trip to the united states he
packed his trunks and bade farewell to his
friends on his way to the railroad sta-
tion he drove down for a last look at the
machine-gun troop the barracks was
strangely deserted disappointed he
went on to the station 

  there lined up guidon and all was
the entire machine-gun troop under com-
mand of sergeant turnbull

  going down the line of men he shook
each by the hand the train was whis-
tling in that annoying persistent way
philippino trains have he swung on to
the lower step of the nearest car the
troop broke ranks and pressed around
him silently

  sergeant turnbull grasped his hand
there were tears in the old mans eyes

  dont forget sah lieutenant- the
old mans voice broke-that this heah
is yoh troop wheahever yoh isand how-
somever dis here troop is your troop
the train started to move davies
found tears in his own eyes the black
faces before him were full of that troubled

pathetic look that a negro has when he is
deserted and forlorn slowly they passed
out of sight davies blew his nose loudly
before going into the car

there was a long silence as major
davies finished speaking the range
details were taking down the red flags
and the men were picking up the empty
cartridges from the firing points

well montgomery asked the major
does that make anything clear to you
yes sir replied the young captain
emphatically but what finally happened
to timmy phelan

  davies grinned

  when i got to manila he announced
i was called into the inspector-generals
office there i was put under oath and
made to tell all i knew of timmy phe-
lans mishandling of the regiment every-
thing i said was put down by a stenog-
rapher i took the transport knowing
from all the signs that timmy phelan
was having a bang-up court martial
prepared for him by the philippine de-
partment davies stopped and gazed
over the mesa

  well did they get him pressed
montgomery

  not exactly davies shook his head
when everything was set and the colo-
nel had been notified that he was to ap-
pear for trial a cablegram came through
from the war department making him a
brigadier general and ordering him to
washington of course that squashed
the charges davies finished lightly
there was a long silence

  major asked montgomery whats
that expression about the letter and the
spirit seems to me it sort of applies to
what youve just been telling me

  you mean the letter killeth and the
spirit maketh to live

  davies rose and stretched himself
you said it they should put that
as a warning at the end of every general
order issued in the army
justice and the spirit of the mob

by bruce johns

f they lynch him said potato
wauggie firmly settling his pince-
nez on his fine nose i shant do a
thing a brute that could waylay a kindly
old fellow like benton and murder him on
his own doorstep for a little sack of gold-
dust deserves all he gets and to try a
jail-break afterwards- no sir shant
do a cndemned thing so long as it isnt in
the township thats what ive told the
boys-

  he broke off and flushed the color
ran up his long bald and sun-burned head
he eyed the indian standing before him
with a certain defiance then he hooked
his heels over the rungs of his rawhided
chair as it leaned against the log office of
the justice of peace of plateau requa and
indicated that he wished to return to the
reading of his horace

  klamath joe the turnkey at the jail
shifted his feet and spat over his proud
beak of a nose his beady intelligent eyes
swept the broad river where the steelhead
lurked in rocky caverns he reluctantly
turned back to the town which slept on
the river-bank it was hot and the wind
smeltof sun-steeped growth therewasthe
yeasty uneasiness of early spring in the air

  you justice of peace he accused in
his deep voice you gotta do somethin

  potato wauggie put his book down
with an annoyed gesture his blue gaze
bit into the indian coldly

  im sworn to maintain the peace in
plateau requa he informed him i
have done so for twenty years i hope to
continue what occurs outside the town-
ship is the business of the sheriff now
he continued tapping his worn old classic

with one bony hand on which a seal ring
shone dully if they take that scoundrel
out from the jail and kill him provided it
occurs outside the township i shant do a
cndemned thing not one cndemned
thing right

  klamath joe sneered

  you mighty careful all of a sudden
  potato wauggie glared

  are you inferring im taking a cow-
ardly advantage of your being left alone
at the jail he asked in pure oxfordese

  the indian shrugged and a dull brick
color mounted into the old mans face
without a word the indian turned on his
heel and began placing his bare feet in the
hot dust that lay between him and the
little log jail that stood on a knoll at the
end of the town

  thomas linforth augustus trowbridge-
penell otherwise known as potato waug-
gie once of woodstock-on-eppington
spring law



sussex turned his pages nervously in the
sun the color had not yet left his long
face and under his gnawed white mus-
tache his lips closed angrily

  looks bad he muttered and looked
down the towns one street to the requa
house where on the veranda groups of
men kept meeting talking and dispersing
with something hurried and secret in their
manner damn that indian trying to
make me feel that he and i are the only
constituted authority in the town agh

  his indignant snort echoed in the clear
california air potato wauggie was suf-
fering from his reputation his indian
name meant incorruptible man who
grows good potatoes

  fine deputy sheriff monahan is-the
fat lazy beggar clearing out for the
county-seat just because of a toothache
just when he knew how unruly the men
are getting about the pole down there in
the jail cant see how joe stomachs the
man

  he worried at his mustache and wrig-
gled in the stout chair he subsided at
last into a watchful fuming silence his
mind running on old man benton his
friend for two decades and the victim of
the stolid polish mucker down in the jail

  everybody in the county had known
old man benton he was a twinkling-
eyed lean old scout whom the children
followed when he came driving his little
white burro hortense into town he
made his little ranch up on the slope of
thunder mountain a sanctuary for birds
and game during the seasons they
flocked in upon him like frightened
youngsters

  all summer the young does brought
their fawns to munch the sweet peaches
and apples that grew around his cabin
and nightly the old man fed coveys of
quail that were plump and saucy as young
chickens everybody knew him and how
he eked out his living from the mine-shaft
on his place once a man had come up
from san francisco to write him up and
his picture had been in the city papers-
robert benton and his wild pets

  plateau requa regarded him not only

as a personal friend but also as a civic
asset his brutal murder shocked not
only their affections it struck at the roots
of their municipal pride there had been
ugly talk afoot ever since the man had
been brought in from three star mine
two days ago

  back at the jail klamath joe squatted
on his heels and thought the poles at-
tempt at jail-breaking the night before
had been an affront to the whole town
the plateau requa calaboose had been a
labor of love a community affair it had
been built in two days of hilarious labor
the men cutting the logs from the pine
ridges about the town the blacksmith
had welded the bars and the women of
the town had held a community supper
the night it was finished there had been
dancing on the hard-packed earth in the
open space in front of the new building
it had all been very gay and pleasant

  klamath joe scratched his head it
brought his fingers into contact with a
tender place-a great welt that ran across
one temple the pole had given it to
him with one of the iron bars wrenched
loose from the window the turnkey
had brought his midday meal into the cell
and had bent over to set down the tray
when the giant brought the iron down
crushingly on his skull it would have
been a fatal blow had the indian not spun
around on his bare heel and taken it
glancingly he had just been able to sog
home the butt of his gun on the big fel-
lows temple and the two had sunk simul-
taneously into unconsciousness deputy
monahan had found them both lying
there

  he had dragged the indian out and re-
vived him eyeing with terrified respect
the inert figure of the prisoner it had
been all he could do to haul the great hulk
into the other cell and get him securely
chained before intelligence began to
flicker back to the small eyes the pole
began to cursc he writhed in his chains
like a titan deputy monahan felt his
blood chill there was a demoniac fury
in the mans threats when gil poggi
took the night stage down to the


bruce johns

county-seat deputy monahan was
aboard he said he was about crazy
with an ulcerated tooth gil poggi said
he certainly didnt look like himself

  klamath joe had gotten up quietly
but with the savage anger of his people
no one had ever struck the indian with
impunity during the war there had been
stories abroad among the grizzlies about
this lithe swarthy man with the touch on
the trigger like velvet and a row of
sharpshooters medals on his khaki blouse

  once a brash lieutenant had in a mo-
ment of strung-up anger flicked him with
a swagger stick and called him a digger
to the high-nosed people of the klamath
that is as if one had questioned the color
of the half-moons at the base of a southern
gentlemans finger-nails

  it had happened one night that this
young fellow with joe and two others
had been detailed to a listening-post ex-
pedition the poor young officer had
weakened at the last moment he got his
men up to the indicated spot through
shell-holes filled with unspeakable things
and had lain down with them in a muck of
mud to listen to the voices of a regiment
of saxons less than ten feet away then
a star-shell had shown them up the
young lieutenant was a man of imagina-
tion it had been too much for him he
had turned and left the men there

  the official report had said that he had
been shot by a sniper as he made his way
back alone to the lines of the two that
came back from that party-joe was one
-nothing was ever said but it was
thought odd that a sniper should find any
cover in that desolate sweep of mud

the stage from the county-seat
came rumbling over the river bridge
it bounced up the slope and chugged to a
stop at the jail door gil poggi leaned
down and beckoned klamath joe floated
out to meet him

  deputy monahan had sent word that
it would take him all week to get his teeth
fixed up-he was suffering something ter-
rible joe had better get some one to
stay at the jail with him on account of the

desperation of the prisoner somebody
big gabe bettincourt would do

  klamath joe drew a small design in the
dust with one great toe and murmured-

  yeh

  gil poggi asked

  whats up joe somethin funny
goin on what all them men doin
hangin around the requa house this
time of day they dont ack natural

  the indian shrugged

  talkin he muttered disgustedly
got nothin else to do

  then his black head and sateen shirt
black too melted into the deep shadow
by the jail door two legs in faded blue
jeans extended into the sun klamath
joe settled into what was apparently a
dozing immobility

  jed abernathy came up the slope a
sack of flour resting on one shoulder his
blue shirt was soaked with sweat and his
skinny old legs trembled a little in the
early heat he stopped in the shadow of
the jail and leaned his flour sack against
the logs he wiped off his nut-brown face
with a worn sleeve

  hot aint it he piped

  yeh

  mind my settin on the step a little
on my way home been down listenin
to the fellers youd ought hear em joe

  yeh

  yeh talkin big ed ellisons drunk
awful mouthy do know you mights
well keep an eye out joe you member
the time he worked em all to horse-
whippin willoughby and they found out
afterward he never stole the hoss at all

  yeh

  the ancient mumbled off a bite of plug-
cut he masticated restfully for a little
and got his wind then he turned his
anxious pale gaze on the somnolent
indian

  you got the feller safe aint you
joe aint no chance him gittin out
agin

  naw

  well worried the old man benton
and i was friends no better feller ever
lived mighty few like him but jest
spring law



the same it dont seem right not to give
the pole a chance

  klamath joe broke into unwonted lo-
quacity

  dont you worry jed nothins gonna
 happen

  he managed to put into it contempt
assurance comfort

  mighty glad joe

  after a little old abernathy paddled
 off to his mountain cabin but the turn-
 key still idled by the jail door

the afternoon lengthened
about four potato wauggie came
ambling along the river-bank over his
shoulder he had a specimen can

  klamath joe rose and went out to meet
 him as he came abreast of-the jail

  want you to keep the jail he re-
marked

  potato wauggie shook his head

  no willie bluejay just brought me
word that hed found a patch of new scar-
let fungus down on beaver creek

  the old oxonian had a passion for
fungi the wet northern california
woods abounded with them and he was
an authority on them his monographs
appeared in obscure and scientific publi-
cations that plateau requa wotted not of
all the indian children in the vicinity
were subsidized into finding new speci-
mens for him

  you stay urged klamath joe my
mama she sick i gotta go down tchi-
panichan ranch see her

  potato wauggie looked at him impa-
tiently

  no no

  i bring you back what you want when
 i come bribed joe

  potato wauggie seemed to come out of
 a scientific daze for the first time he
 looked at the indian sharply

  what is it you want he demanded

  the indians eyes were as impenetrable
 as agate he raised one great flipper in a
 gesture that conveyed his complete inno-
 cence of guile

  youre trying to trap me accused
the old man you-youre tfying to

 abandon me with the responsibility ill
 not do it

  the other stood carved of dark wood
the old man turned on one sockless
heel

  i wont he said flatly cndemned
if i do

  joe said mildly

  i can git gabe bettincourt to stay
with you hes good an big but id
want you to be boss officer the law
potato wauggie seemed to swell his
face crimsoned his blue eyes got steely

  thatll do he told the turnkey
crisply you force my hand very well
get on your way wherever youre going
potato wauggie followed him into the
jail he strode stiff-legged with wrath
and his adams apple leapt spasmodically
the indian handed him a string with
some keys on it

  i be back before supper he mur-
mured this one cell door this one
outside

  he looked levelly into the old mans
eyes the englishman stared back

  so you think he observed icily that
theyll be here before night

  klamath joes face never altered
mebbe so mebbe not lotta them
boys cornin in from the ranches gittin
drunk git crazy cant tell

  he floated out of the door on his brown
feet and was crossing the open space
then he dipped into the river trail and
was gone the old englishman stood
in the door looking at the green spot
where he had disappeared

  never thought he was yellow before
he muttered slowly queer

  then he began to look carefully about
the little pine room potato wauggie
was the survivor of fifteen years of fron-
tier warfare in afghanistan and the upper
provinces of india that survival was by
reason of a good many qualities of mental
alertness

  the room had but one window so he
moved the heavy rawhided chair in which
fat deputy monahan habitually dozed
midway between it and the two doors
he gave one impersonal glance into the


bruce johns

cell where the big body of the murderer
loomed by the light from the high win-
dow he could see the bullet head bent to
the massive chest then he sat down and
tucked his heels over the chair rungs he
looked like a mild old gentleman eying
the sunny afternoon in serene dreaminess
but a close observer would have seen
small bunches of muscles taut along his
jaws and a certain springiness in the way
his lean old shanks rested against the
chair

klamath joe was plunging along
the river trail which he had known
since boyhood he was thinking deeply
and his bare feet avoided the sharp cor-
ners of the stones unconsciously he
was startled back to his surroundings by
hearing some one coming toward him
crashing heavily through the brush on the
hillside he stepped into the shadow of a
granite boulder and waited

  gabe bettincourt came panting through
the waist-high chaparral his bare curly
black head and wide shoulders powdered
over with the fine flowers of the wild
lilac he stopped before the indian and
drew a long breath

  saw yuh leave took a short cut over
the hill to ketch yuh wanted yuh to
know joe theys trouble cornin them
boys is in from sligos ranch they aint
seen town since christmas and theyre
out to raise hell an ed ellisons talky
drunk

  he paused his kind little black eyes
rested anxiously on the indians impassive
face

  yeh said klamath joe

  gabe scratched his ear where a spray
of lilac flowers tickled him

  i was goin over to the mariposa
mine he offered to see my gal but i
can stay monahans a skunk to leave
you alone like this i hear too theys a
passel of fellers driftin in from frisco fer
the spring lumberin lord knows which
way theyll jump if theys trouble they
aint likely to keep outa it not with ed
ellison and bootleg

  klamath joe broke off a succulent

spray of herbage that had found root
on the mossy surface of the granite and
chewed it

  aint gonna be no trouble go along
and see yer gal and leave monahan
outa this

  the big fellow stared at him doubtfully

  well awright only i hate to-

  gwan snapped joe

  he moved out of the shade and with no
further adieu moved off on the trail
gabe bettincourt looked after him he
shook his head and after a moment
started back to town

  the indian had come to an opening on
the river-bank where sprawled a group of
pine huts together with some rows of corn
and a patch of pumpkins a flock of in-
dian children played there their bright
cotton dresses and black heads shining in
the sun a dozen dogs dozed in the
shadows

  klamath joe stepped along to a house
under a great cottonwood tree a tall
woman sat on the doorstep combing
out her long dark hair joe sank down
beside her they roasted in the sun for a
time then the man began to talk after
a little they went into the small house

  the woman lighted a blue-flame oil-
stove and took down a clean kettle from
the wall from a row of cans on a shelf
she began to take pinches of dried leaves
bits of roots and some dark powders
the mess in the kettle boiled and sang
then the woman cooled it and poured a
little of the dark liquor into a bottle
klamath joe slipped the vial into hisshirt

he began to track back to the jail in
the late afternoon the shadow had
already fallen on the river as he went
but he paused by a deep pool bottle-
green under the dark rocks he shucked
off his shirt and jeans and dived in
cleanly the green water closed over him
for a little while he moved soundlessly
as an otter then he slipped out and
drew on the same drab husk a few mo-
ments later he was nearing the jail

  potato wauggie rose from the raw-
hided chair between the two doors one
spring law



of his eyes was completely closed his
shirt was in ribbons and the knuckles of
his fists were bloody his one eye
gleamed coldly

  i trust your esteemed mother is quite
herself he enunciated from his puffed lips

  the indian merely asked-

 who

  potato wauggies face twisted into
what was intended for a grin

  the boys from sligos theyve been
in all day listening to whispering ed
ellison didnt know he was such a
friend of bentons seems to me ive
heard benton say he was pretty much of a
stinker but to hear him talk now youd
think theyd been lifelong friends doubt-
less its the bootleg hes been guzzling
he has been urging the boys to take the
law in their own hands they thought
theyd try a little it was concluded the
old man dryly mostly bad liquor and
the spring weather maybe

  klamath joe asked-

  they hurt you

  the old man shook his head happily
there was in his eye the light that thirty
years before had been present when he
had dived head first and alone into a
milling crowd of fighting coolies in a low
quarter in cawnpore it had won him
another nickname that day one that in
the vernacular meant englishman with
gunpowder in his fists

  the englishman shook himself and
went back to his earlier manner

  i trust i may be allowed to leave

  sure

  potato wauggie stepped for the door
his bare brown leg flickering through the
slit linen of his trousers

  he stopped in the door

  perhaps he sneered you have
other female relatives youd care to visit
if so i might suggest that you put it off
for a little while i think youll have
trouble a little later

  klamath joe let him get outside the
door before he spoke but his voice
reached the old man clearly

  bout eight nine oclock i figure
better bring a gun

   

  potato wauggies lip lifted he didnt
answer but limped on down the slope
toward the office of the justice of peace
and his shipshape little dwelling behind it
with its orderly patch of garden

the requa house dinner bell
clanged and the talking men began
to drift inside klamath joe could hear
their uninterrupted conversation through
the open windows of the hotel then an
indian boy came shuffling over with a
tin tray it had on it joes dinner and
the evening meal for the prisoner joe
set it down on the pine table in the front
room he looked the food over and con-
tented himself with a quart or so of scald-
ing coffee and a piece of cornbread his
big hands passed swiftly over the clutter
of porcelain bird-baths that held the
greasy food then he set the tray on top
of the round-bellied stove and began to
move the furniture about the room

  across the doorway he tilted the heavy
table he backed it by a tool chest
over the one window he spiked the
wooden door which had closed between
the two rooms of the jail he extin-
tinguished the lamp and went back into
the empty cell where he busied himself

  from the next cubicle the pole heard
him at work

  hey he complained dont i
eat

  shut up said the indian

  it was eight oclock before he was back
in the front room then he saw that a
mass of men had detached themselves
from the milling groups around the requa
house steps they moved forward up
the knoll a many-headed figure the
piny hills had shut the town into a rich
blue-black twilight lighted with the -
many stars of the northern california
coast country

  it was a sweet evening with that hint
of something impending which spring
always brings-a hidden electric current
that sets men to doing mad things add
corn liquor to early spring and the result
is a dangerous explosive

  klamath joe sank the black top of his


bruce johns

head on a level with his table barricade
and peered out he hunched forward the
weight that sagged under his shirt by his
left armpit

  the men stopped as they topped the
slope they drew together and stared at
the dark box of the jail then one man
made a move forward and they all fol-
lowed like sheep they reached the
packed space fifteen feet from the jail door

  hey yelled a voice weve come
fer yertin better come on out joe

  the indian recognized the tones of
whispering ed ellison the loud-mouthed
rancher from over the hills his voice
was thick and uncertain behind him
the turnkey heard the pole give a whine
of horror

  damn they after me

  hi you joe answer er well shoot
yer door in

  the indian spoke from the gloom

  git along you gonna get in trouble
you try that

  a snarl as from a pack of hungry dogs
went out into the stillness of the summer
night far above the impartial stars
shone with a million silver points the
pine trees moved in a fragrant wind this
sudden flare of blood-raging men stood
like a dark excrescence upon the placid
face of the evening

  whispering ed made one more try
we aint gonna stand no nonsense
were gonna string up that dirty pole
killin a nice old fella like benton if
yuh dont want yer neck broke yuh bet-
ter listen to reason

  klamath joe didnt answer he closed
the door

  then they were on the jail steps fight-
ing and growling like a pack of wolves
the indian heard the glass shower in the
window and the surprized grunt of the
men as their fists struck hard planking
he felt his way to the stove and then
stepped into the back room

  theyre after yuh he told the quiv-
ering hulk of flesh in the cell heres
yer supper eat it yuhll need it

  he lighted a match the man stared
at him a froth-flecked animal

 eat commanded the indian harshly

 yertin mouthed-

 theyll git me-

 klamath joe drew his gun from under
 his arm-pit in the wavering light the
 pole saw the ugly barrel

 eat yer food er ill kill yuh

 the man made a stupid pass at the cold
 victuals on the tray the match went
 out the indian heard him breathe sob-
 bingly as he gulped some of the stuff

 outside the men were beginning to
 shout some one had already thought of
 a tree-trunk battering-ram and the little
 building was quivering with the regular
 strokes of the manned wooden piston
 feet pounded on the roof in one comer
 the starlight was coming in where men
 were ripping the shingles off

 through the din-

 eat shouted the indian in the ear
 of the terrified murderer then still in
 darkness joe bent down and unlocked the
 leg chains that held the man to the bunk

 git up

 the man rose stupified

 git ahead of me into the other cell
 and dont fergit i got the drop on yuh

 the man began to shuffle his feet out
 of the little cubicle and to feel his way
 along the wall

 pandemonium was on without there
 came through the interstices of the high-
 barred windows dancing flares of blood-
 red light

 got brush fire muttered joe burn
 us out hey

 the man moving before him whim-
 pered the turnkey gave him a directing
 poke in the small of the back with the gun

 git in stand against that window
 with yer arms up and dont fergit i can
 see yuh fine against that window

 the big man moved over and hung
 himself against the wall

 arms up snapped joe

 he swung up the heavy muscles against
 the high bars they gave under the
 weight swung wholly free of their embed-
 ding mortar yertin gave a strangled cry
 then he moaned-

 god im too sick
spring law

s

  klamath joe spoke in his great hairy
ear

  yuh cant git outa there hills over
yon you make it to that pine tree men
wont see yuh up to you to git to the
brush wait till they git around in
front

  the heavy door was already giving but
the village blacksmith had put his heart
into his work when he had made the great
hasp and hinges they yelled for more
men the stragglers who were wander-
ing noisily about the jail began to go to
the front for a concerted shove a last
rush that should break down the strain-
ing door

  now said joe

  yertins cable-like muscles heaved him
up to the window ledge he swung out
and dropped to the sandy earth the
ground was lighted with a crimson glare
and atop the jail men stood and made
frantic gestures yertin began to run
but his feet moved with nightmarish
slowness he staggered his ankles
seemed leaden

  once he flung up his hand and seemed
to dash something from his gaze kla-
math joe hanging out of the window
could hear his breath labor

  the runner was yet twenty feet away
from the pine tree a low-spreading brushy
shelter the sand sucked at his feet

  then klamath joe opened his mouth
and from it issued a sound that was like a
locomotive gone mad a terrible piercing
yell that rose above the general bedlam as
if it were a steam siren

  in an instant men came pouring around
the corners of the jail and in that in-
stant clear in the fire-light joes arm
came out of the window a long spurt of
flame leapt from it yertin his fingers al-
ready touching the green boughs of the
pine went down his giant body
sprawled out like a great black bird
ah-h

  the sound went up from the men in a
released gasp then they began to run
forward but klamath joe had dropped
from the window and was before them at
the fallen figure he turned it over with

his bare foot and leaned over it they
saw the bloody smears on the head
then he stood up his gun still in his great
brown hands

  dead he announced and his opaque
eyes ran over the men who had stopped in
a semicircle a few feet back he took
them in one by one they shifted un-
certainly under his gaze

  anj you wanta do anythin more

  his metallic syllables rattled around
the circle like shot

  whispering ed ellison pushed forward
his little red eyes were still burning with
alcoholic light

  he aint either dead i seenm
twitch i wanta make sure the devils
dead

  the indian made the slightest of move-
ments with his gun

  you got any doubt i hitm he
queried in an even tone

 the fuddled rancher stopped he
looked uneasily at the indian standing
over the prostrate man

  naw he mumbled at last

  then a tall figure was fighting its way
through the packed circle potato waug-
gie burst into the open space an old
cavalry pistol in either hand tears run-
ning down his face he was crying with
rage

  joe he gritted i went to sleep
oh hell went to sleep like an old
granny im too late

  his bruised face was ludicrous in his
self-despising rage

  the thin lips of the indian spread into
a grin

  sawright he soothed the old man
you gotta take charge here now-place
of the sheriff

  potato wauggie turned and looked
about the staring men then major
trowbridge-penell barked in the old voice
of cawnpore

  get you lousy beggars youve done
enough for one night get

  there was an angry snarl from the
group but the white figure suddenly
loomed taller there was a snap to the
shoulders and the polished bores of two


bruce johns

guns winked in the firelight some one
made a movement it converted itself
into a general restless stir

  then a voice said

  hell fellers its all over mights
well go the devil got what was cornin
to him

  yeah hes dead

  cmon

  one by one they began to melt away
into the darkness

ptato wauggie faced the indian
joe said-

  help me carrym

  they staggered with the giants weight
to the shattered front door they
heaved the pole through and laid him on
the floor

  potato wauggie hunted for a lamp
found at last a piece of candle stuck in a
bottle the wavering light filled the
wrecked room

  the old man turned to see the indian
bending over the body a coil of heavy
hemp in his hand he was knotting the
two thick ankles together and binding
the flaccid hands over the broad chest
w-what- gasped potato wauggie

 joe raised his black shock head and
 looked at the justice he said nothing
 but between the two men there passed
 a whole conversation

 potato wauggie stepped over and
 pulled down the mans lower lid he
 raised his head and stared at joe

 doped

 yeah admitted klamath joe
 somethin my mama makes

 didnt you hit him at all

 sure creasedm on the head didnt
 hurtm much-stunnedm

 the indian was fumbling in the rub-
 bish he found an old coat and began
 to draw it on distastefully

 say he asked the englishman in a
 quiet drawl you knew deputy mona-
 hans had false teeth twenty thirty
 year

 eh

 they looked at each other and a grin
 spread between them

 where you going demanded potato
 wauggie

 klamath joe answered him seriously

 county-seat gonna git sheriff beas-
 ley this townneeds a lesson aint

when the war came to the new hebrides

      victory

       by j d newsom

when the dogs began to bark
james dilke poured himself an-
other drink and blew out the
light the dogs barked louder than ever
and the angry voice of monsieur gaston
pro vain came out of the darkness

  what is it then must one be set
upon by mad hounds when one attempts
to enter dilke dilke i demand to
speak with you dilke most imperatively
must i have words with you

  m provain was outside the fence sur-
rounding dilkes property the dogs were
on the inside but the gate opened outward
and the angry underfed setters were
aware of the fact he was forced to put
all his weight against the gate at the
risk of having his weight bitten to keep
the wild animals from getting out and
devouring him

  im not at home answered dilke
shouting at the top of his lungs im in
bed-sleepin its two oclock in the
mornin and im sleepin i tell you
arouse then awake dilke nomde
dieu must i be eaten in the raw state by
these hounds of perdition arouse for i

have news of the most cataclysmic
the setters were pawing at the gate and
snapping at his legs through the bars at
any moment as he well knew they might
break through and leap at his throat not
to mention more exposed portions of his
corpulent anatomy

  gway ordered dilke  streper-
ous frenchman been out on the tiles
sprized at you go t bed go t sleep-
sht up im soun sleep no power on
earth can gemme up

  he drank the tumblerful of raw whisky
at a gulp then closed his eyes to convince
himself that he was really sound asleep
but the room spun around at such an
alarming rate and at such unexpected
angles that he had to open them again

  dash it all he grumbled bally
nuisance this i must be getting old
heats too much for poor old dilke heat
and loneliness poor old bean

  he patted himself on the knee and
nodded his head as the dogs bayed more
savagely than ever

  tear him t pieces he chuckled
two oclock in the mornin never


j d newsom

heard of such goings on ts not right
ts not genteel- frog he shouted
frog gway

  i will shoot pro vain cried i will
shoot them dead the gun is in my
hand i aim at the dogs i give you ten
seconds and not a second more i de-
mand to speak to you dilke

  if thaz case decided dilke id
better wake up quick eh wha one
two three four- he drew a deep breath
and yelled call off the dogs tommy
visitor wants see me j

  a kanaka houseboy who had been
squatting on the veranda chewing betel-
nut and waiting to put his master to bed
whistled to the dogs and shambled down
the path to chase them away they re-
treated snarling

  m provain trotted up to the house
and jerked open the screen door with so
much violence that it nearly came off its
hinges

  if you gotta match dilke said
pleasantly you can ligh the ligh i
cant get up juz yet wakin up so
sudden makes me dizzy

  a light flared in the darkness cupping
his hands about the flame provain
crossed the room with a firm heavy tread
until he collided with the table some-
thing fell off and rumbled about on the
floor

  thas shwisky bot groaned dilke
if the corks come out its calamity
nothing less only got two dozen bots
left have to ration mself sawful

  what cried provain is a little
whisky

  he groped about for the lamp up-
setting in quick succession a water jug
a can of tobacco an alarm clock and two
glasses

  it is as nothing compared to the-to
the-

  his lingers closed on the lamp stand and
he became absorbed in the complicated
task of removing the hot chimney

  s no sense in smashing all i pssess
protested dilke snot my fault f im
dizzy two oclock in the morning he
became indignant ts not genteel

im sprized at you mister gastong
provain if thats your name you been
drinking he sniffed so hard that he
choked i can smell it sdisgusting
thats what it is-disgusting still im
a goo fellow i can put up with a lot
thats me-dilke good old bean

  provain was doing intricate things
which required his whole attention
abruptly another match crackled and a
yellow flame crept around the lamp wick
he clamped the glass chimney in place
the shadows retreated revealing dilkes
terrible living room it appeared to have
been struck by a high wind which had
knocked the furniture askew papers
were scattered about on the floor the
table was heaped with dirty plates every
rickety chair in the room was piled high
with newspapers magazines books and a
st range assortment of clothing

  even the pictures on the walls were
tilted at uncomfortable angles and a
stuffed albatross clumsily nailed to the
wall was being removed fragment by
fragment by a swarm of ants which
crawled in a black line between the bird
and a hole in the woodwork just above a
framed picture of edward vii in four
colors

  from the depths of a dilapidated arm-
chair dilke blinked his eyes and smiled
hospitably he was a thin little man with
a weak mouth and not overmuch chin
his cheeks were covered with a ten-day
stubble which gave him a somewhat
ferocious appearance he wore a singlet
and a pair of trousers of black broad-
cloth held up with a pair of sky-blue
suspenders one foot was bare the other
was covered with a black sock

  compared with this wreck m provain
looked respectable beyond belief his
suit of black alpaca enlivened by a red
necktie attached to his shirt with a gold
clip gave him a dignified appearance
his panama hat was spotless there was
a look of funereal gravity on his face
which made dilke remark

  you looks if youd swallowed a pin
ha ve another drink

  dilke my friend provain said in a
victory



stern voice compose yourself it is not
for pleasure that i call upon you at this
hour of the morning

he made a sweeping gesture with both
arms- you can have all i got every

deavor whats tall about anyhow

sied provain it is the end of all things
the forts at liege are being cannonaded
belgium is attacked but we shall be in
berlin in six weeks the dirty boche
ah

  he clenched his fists and glowered at
dilke who made himself as small as
possible in the depths of the arm chair

  be sensible he urged war at two
oclock in the morning shame on you
youll be seeing snakes next like i did
last christmas why youre drunk
thas what think of callin this island
berlin snonsense its called kale-
wara and i can say it dizzy or-or not

   mon dieu wailed provain thump-
ing the table with his fists and thrusting
his face within inches of dilkes nose
have you no intelligence at all has
your whisky rotted your mind dilke
for the love of god listen to me there is
a formidable war raging in europe our
europe where we both come from not
in the new hebrides is this war but in
europe belgium has been attacked
england has declared war on germany
and she is-

  no breathed dilke staring pop-
eyed at the speaker im sprized
first ive heard of it suddenly a
thought stirred in his whirling brain and
his eyes filled with intense suspicion
who dyou say i was fighting he de-
manded harshly  m i fighting you or
somebody else if im at war with you
frog you better watch out sno
quarter allowed i like you personally
but-

  we are allies cried provain flinging
out his arms in a gesture of welcome
we are fighting shoulder to shoulder
against the barbarians side by side the
gallant soldiers of france and britain are
stemming the avalanche although one
must say that you have but one hundred
thousand men in the field still-
mustnt forget the navy added
dilke

  no no the grand british navy
and my friend we who are exiled in the
pacific must also do our duty that is
why i hastened to arouse you as soon as
the news reached me we must act in
the words of camille desmoulins
audacity more audacity and yet more
audacity 

  not to me he didnt say that re-
torted dilke all he said to me was
the freight rates going up next trip
thas all he knows how to say if you
ask me

  camille desmoulins was a hero of the
french revolution thundered the in-
censed frenchman he died-

  oh thas all right must have been
thinking of somebody else dilke said
with a tolerant shrug doesnt matter


j d newsom

a bit so were at war i believe you
buts funny tommy didnt tell me

  it is of no interest to him alas to
us it is all-all i shall go to my regi-
ment as soon as the astrolabe calls on her
way back to noumea as a vulgar cor-
poral i shall fight the germans in the
meantime here we are representatives of
two great sister nations-the only white
men on kalewara the entente cordiale
binds us with ineradicable ties my
friend-ties of the most sacred to-
gether we face the foe we must prepare
to defend this sacred soil should the
germans attempt to force a landing we
must be ready for them

  with a last tremendous effort dilke
levered himself out of his chair and stood
swaying unsteadily on his legs he
waggled one finger at provain and said
very slowly and distinctly

  we must observe the decencies i
shall show you how an englishman rises
to the-hie-occasion

  what are you going to do anxiously
inquired provain we must decide
quickly upon a plan of action

  ssh wait i was a gennelman once
ill show you

  he made a tour of the room picking
up stray garments as he lurched from
chair to chair and staggered off to his
bedroom carefully closing the door be-
hind him

  tommy came his hoarse voice
tommy a gennelman wants you

  the kanaka crossed the living-room
like a black shadow in a bright red loin
cloth and joined his master

  m provain paced nervously up and
down he wrung his hands mopped his
streaming forehead pulled at his beard
and displayed all the customary symp-
toms of violent excitement to him the
news was of immense importance he
would have to leave his island where he
was somebody and go back to a line
regiment where he was nobody back
there he might die but the thought did
not disturb him much france was at
war therefore he too was at war

  kalewara was a small island at the

  northern end of the new hebrides
archipelago cut off from all intercourse
with the outer world save for the mail-
boat which called every three weeks yet
he was already thinking of mustering the
natives and drilling them so that they
might resist all possible attacks their
world was limited by the watery horizon
but he was composing in his mind fiery
speeches in pidjin-french with which to
stir their imaginations

  he was the only employer of labor on
the island his plantation was well man-
aged and prosperous dilke did not
count he was supposed to run a small
store but in reality he was chiefly en-
gaged in the merry business of drinking
himself into his grave

  the frenchman lived at one end of the
island facing the only navigable inlet
the britons shack was built some miles
inland on the outskirts of a native village
he rarely went down to meet the mail-
boat his boys collected his letters and his
trade-goods he had made what he
called a gaudy mess of life and he kept
very much to himself his one link with
the past consisted in ordering as much
printed matter as he could afford the
poorer he became the more he ordered
hibberts journal lay in a dusty corner
unread beneath a stack of illustrated
french periodicals

  the minutes dragged by provain be-
came more and mor restless he picked
up the whisky bottle and poured himself
a drink he needed a stimulant coffee
would have been better but dilke never
had anything on hand except strong
waters the fiery stuff seemed to make
provains blood boil in his veins he
resumed his pacing

  the heat was oppressive the breeze
had died down and the song of the
mosquitoes outside the screened windows
fitted the air with a prolonged nerve-
racking drone

  one of dilkes dogs scratched at the
door nosed it open and ambled in
sniffing it caught sight of provain and
wagged its tail which was moth-eaten and
sad no doubt that the animal wished
victory



  to be friendly but provain was taking no
risks he knew exactly how ferocious
that same beast could be if aroused he
did not like strange dogs nor did they
like him as a general rule

  dilke he announced trying to pitch
his voice at just the right key so as not to
annoy the dog dilke it is your hound
which has entered i pray you come at
once

   snice dog came the muffled an-
swer pat it ill be out in a second

   i will kill it if it approaches retorted
provain speaking between his teeth

  here i come dilke called out
hold your fire

  the door swung open dilke minced
out as if he were walking on eggs dressed
in a threadbare tuxedo complete with
patent-leather pumps and hard-boiled
shirt his face wore a look of twitching
patriotic fervor

  but mon dieu did you not compre-
hend cried the flabbergasted provain
it is not for a wedding that i have sum-
moned you-it is war that has been
declared

  thas just it agreed dilke and
im ready he squared his shoulders
clenched his fists stuck out his chin and
almost fell down  n englishman al-
ways hides his emotions phlegmatic
race as representative of my nation i
offer you a drink

  why blankly inquired the french-
man who was not acquainted with the
procedure

   s proper thing a toast-victory
as nelson said at trafalgar-

  a shadow crossed mr provains face
but we are allies now my dear
friend he said quickly let us forget
those regrettable incidents

  regretble snorted dilke i like
that nothing of the sort sir most
glorious page in all history sir nelson
and his one eye and his one arm he could
whip- well never mind i wouldnt
hurt your feelings not much here we
go

  he leaned against the table and poured
out the drinks

  sir he said with intense seriousness
i offer you victory 

  vive la france brayed provain car-
ried away by his emotions  vive les
allies a berlin

  to arms cried dilke slopping whisky
over a bound volume of medical journals
to the good old british pluck

  they drank standing with their arms
around each others neck tommy the
kanaka poked a black bewildered face
around the corner and tried to figure out
what all the noise was about having
made up his mind that it would be an all-
night session he uncorked another bottle
placed it just inside the doorway and went
to sleep

e must act at once declared
provain napoleon said in
war victory goes to he who most resolutely
attacks 

  to he who-to he who dilke re-
peated vaguely he mumbled the words
several times and explained with drunken
gravity im n owl to he who to he
who im hoot owl look at my shut-
front f you dont believe me -s bulging
im n owl all right

  a sudden access of remorse and rage
shook provain he hurled his glass to the
floor and stamped about the room cursing
his ally

  man of the most contemptible he
shouted at dilke fiend you have led
me astray your vile whisky it is the
drink of barbarians i execrate it it
inflames the meninges it destroys the
control of self one drink and i vacillate
like a ship without a gouvernail i be-
come incoherent even to myself mon
dieu mon dieu but it is monstrous
stuff

  he paused and a look of exaltation
kindled in his eye

  ah but the wine of france that is fit
for a civilized mans palate for his brain
for his stomach for his-

  dilke was so shocked by this outburst
of temper that he ceased being a hoot owl
and tried to be offended

  pardon me he broke in d i hear


j d newsom

you say i was a barbarian by any chance
dl hear you correctly

  uh remarked provain held up in
mid-stride

  dyou say i was a barbarian re-
peated dilke jamming his bulging shirt-
front into his vest and preparing for
action

  i said-

  i heard you and lemme say between
allies thas no way to speak to me not
if you want to remain allies dyou ever
hear of darwin huxley harvey new-
ton wellington faraday congreve
wilde johnson smith jones smith-
he paused to replenish his imagination and
his lungs- and you come to me and
talk about barbarians bgone n how
about cotton-goods and steel and coal-
ah but my friend it is from scotland
that whisky comes

  sssame family my grandmothers a
mactavish n you can leave her alone
buried in peebles she is whas matter
with you anyway insulting gennelman
in his own home outrage pologize or
ill put the dogs on to you

  it was a slip of the tongue provain
admitted alarmed at the prospect of being
attacked by the dogs my dear friend
believe me we must not most stupidly
quarrel at the outset of our great task
i wont f you wont promised
dilke but dont forget waterloo n
cressy and smothers i forget juz now
i forget nothing said provain si-
lently asking heaven to give him pa-
tience but let us set such matters to one
side for now we have a common foe-the
germans

eat em alive lets have a drink
dilke dilke pleaded the french-
man i appeal to your patriotism let
us face the situation with inexorable
calm

  why im calm as a dead fish look
i can stand on one foot and close m
eyes

  he tried and sat down upon a mound
of newspapers

  still a bit dizzy he smiled but im
seaworthy all right

  provain took off his sun-helmet and
ran his hands through his bushy black
hair

  oh but i lose my sanity he cried in
despair the dawn is in the sky and we
have done nothing decided nothing
but wha dyou want me to do
tearfully protested dilke i don know
wha you expect thats the whole
trouble weve done our share seems to
me-toasted the allies sung the mar-
seillaise sung god save the king and
wished em all luck thats enough isnt
it

  it is but a prelude snapped provain
do you know who fives on the island of
eromatti do you knowl

  old man schlager thas who dilke
answered brightly good old schlager
havent seen him since christmas when
he gave that dinner

  schlager is a german a boche he
must be arrested before he has time to do
any harm

  whas the idea of arresting a fellow
like that dilke protested schlagers
fine fellow one of the best asked me
over to his place last christmas gave me
dts with his schnapps and put me to
bed right in his own house f you
wanted to arrest dumoulin id be with
you but schlager-

  he is a boche we are at war with
him and he must not be allowed to go
free on the soil of france

  there you go again this aint
france-its the new hebrides s big
difference

  it belongs to france

   n it also belongs to england re-
torted dilke craning his thin neck out of
his wilted collar dual ownership if
its yours its mine s foolish arrange-
ment s if you knew anything about
colonies

  anyhow provain went on desper-
ately this german is a menace we
must seize him and send him to vila to be
interned if we do not he will come here
and burn your store shoot you dead per-
haps devastatemy plantation oh i know
these boche in eighteen-seventy-
victory



  that doesnt sound like old schlager
mused dilke but if hes going to burn
my store thas another matter thas
going too far youre sure hes going to
burn my store

  but of course in war it is kill or be
killed they are worse than the kanakas
those germans i know them in
eighteen-seventy my grandfather-
well that settles it dilke declared
old schlagers going too far cant have
him burning my store can i we must
lock him up quick

  and we shall have helped our cause by
eliminating at least one dangerous
enemy cried provain

before the sun was up they were out
at sea in provains launch heading for
the island of eromatti the frenchman
who did not trust his allys singleness of
purpose had refused to wait until dilke
changed his clothes the latter sat on the
roof of the cabin reading a sydney paper
an automatic was thrust between his
vest and his hard-boiled shirt-front

  provain stood at the wheel leaning
forward as if trying to drive the launch
faster through the water in the bows
three kanakas lay snoring on the narrow
deck on the cabin cushions lay pro-
vains arsenal-a double-barreled shot-
gun a single-barreled shotgun a revolver
and a tricolor flag which was to be hoisted
over schlagers plantation as soon as the
place had been captured

  when we disembark provain ex-
plained we march straight up to the
house and i shall say to this boche-
listen to this one chuckled dilke
slapping the paper there was n irish-
man who landed at freemantle-

  and i shall say to this boche sur-
render or die 

  -without a penny in his pocket and
he went into a restaurant and ordered a
big dinner and when-

  if he refuses to surrender you hear i
shall fire upon him

  wha for inquired dilke

  oh groaned provain read read
your imbecile paper and be still but

remember i am in command when we
step ashore and if i order fire you must
fire is that clear

  as mud beamed dilke why do
you say fire

  to kill schlager name of heaven
roared provain dilke i implore you
become sober become alert become com-
prehensive it is schlager who would
burn your store

  lets burn his house down sug-
gested dilke juz to teach him

  if he will not surrender he dies and
his property will be sequestrated pro-
vain retorted coldly even in wartime
we do not burn valuable property

  dilke winked knowingly

  might run over mself and see if i
couldnt run the place he mused

  ah yes snapped provain who had
other ideas as to the ultimate disposal of
schlagers property

  and so this irishman- went on
dilke picking up the thread of his joke

  i do not wish to hear about your
irishman provain retorted i am
thinking of more serious matters my
friend we are at war

  eromatti shoved its twin peaks above
the horizon and soon the launch slid
through the pass into smooth green
waters ahead lay a deep bay fringed
by thick forest growth at the far end
by the muddy mouth of a river there
was a stoutly built landing stage and a
shed roofed with corrugated iron

  you see observed provain as the
kanakas made the launch fast to the
pillars of the wharf these boche they
settle down as if they were the masters
imagine it mein herr builds great sheds
and a landing stage as if ordinary methods
were not good enough for him

  well why not s quicker n costa
less in the long run

  but where does the money come
from inquired provain answering his
question with the same breath he is
subsidized i feel sure but let us not
argue come

  i wish somebodyd subsidize me
commented dilke


j d newsom

  a gun ordered provain handing him
one take it-and remember

  is it loaded

  oui oui oui but naturally it is
to war that we go

  ah we we we agreed dilke
but naturally

  he began to laugh and hastily apolo-
gized when he saw the look of intense
suspicion on provains face

  im almost sober he pointed out
could we have one nip before we start
a bracer eh what steady our gallant
nerves mine are jumpy as the very deuce
this morning

  one glance at dilkes shaking hands
convinced provain that the best thing to
do was to humor him the man was in
no fit condition to play his part he fished
a bottle of cognac out of a locker and
shuddered when dilke put it to his lips
and drank a third of it as if it were water

  gaudy stuff smiled the englishman
putting the bottle into his pocket full
of steam he shook himself like a dog
shaking water off its coat and smacked
his lips forward he cried onward
ker-ristian sohoholdiers-

  silence roared provain du calme
wc must surprize the enemy

  a kanaka laborer came out of the
godown to see who was causing the dis-
turbance he saluted smartly as the two
white men marched by side by side

  he has taught them the military
salute provain ejaculated no doubt
but they are all armed and trained
perhaps who knows it is to our death
that we go be brave dilke courage
they followed a broad path bordered
with tall trees running back to a two-
story house painted white with green
shutters standing in the shade of a clump
of mango trees in a field close to the
road lean cows were trying to become
acclimatized

   s nice place murmured dilke
and if he will not surrender said
provain shoot

  they reached the house their in-
tended victim sat on the veranda making
entries in a ledger which he held on his

knees he looked up at them over gold-
rimmed spectacles and a slight frown
appeared between his eyes

  schlager- began provain in a voice
which shook with emotion

 one moment the german said
curtly i am balancing my accounts
please

  he was a large fleshy man with a large
fleshy red face his manners were dis-
tinctly abrupt apparently he resented
this intrusion

  your accounts can wait declared
provain schlager you are a prisoner
at the first hostile gesticulation i shall
shoot

  schlager carefully placed a sheet of
blotting paper between the pages of the
ledger and closed the book with a snap
which jarred dilkes sensitive nerves

  i do not wish to skylark he declared
today i am busy provain put down
that gun please it might be loaded
it is loaded i will inform you the
frenchman retorted and it is to shoot
at you that i aim it

  thas righ agreed dilke favoring
schlager with a ghastly smile youre a
goo fellow but you cant come and burn
my store down thas going too far
youre a prisoner

  ha-ha remarked schlager trying to
appease these two madmen it is very
funny i laugh now you must go away
and let me work today i am busy
despite his good resolution his voice be-
came sharp if you do not go away he
added i will have my boys tarke you
away

  i am not here to amuse myself do not
believe it snapped provain it is duty
of the sternest-

  put down that gun

  never duty compels-

  once more put down that gun

  and i ordep you to surr-

  schlagers red face became purple
the veins on his neck stood out in knotted
ropes

  loafing ruffians he brayed i do
not keep open house no i am not a
wayside hotel no i am not a drunken
victory

 

sailor nor a beachcomber no do you
think you can walk in here whenever you
wish for a cheap drink you are mis-
taken no more do i wish for your
society i order you to go away at once
during this speech he banged the
ledger with the palm of his hand and
glared at the two offenders

   snot our fault protested dilke with
tears in his eyes mustnt get mad old
bean not at us here- he dragged
the bottle from his pocket and held it out
- have a lil drink juz to show theres
no ill feeling

  dirty beast retorted the german
vile beast drink-besodden english-
man i do not drink with you-nor with
you either provain you i thought you
a sober man but it is not so it is the
tropics which demoralize such decadent
races as yours only germans are true
colonists i work while you drink yes
that is so

  you accuse me of drunkenness when i
am in the performance of my duty cried
provain oh but it is difficult to re-
strain my finger upon this trigger
schlager you-

  whas that you said about colo-
nists inquired dilke trying to appear
angry lemme tell you about the
british empire-

  dilke nom de dieu be still begged
provain whose arms were growing weary
of holding up the shotgun how can i
tell this boche-

  boche roared schlager now it is
insults because i will not give you free
drinks it is threats to my life that you
make i will have you up before the court
at vila my boys will throw you out
but he did not call his houseboys be-
cause he was not sure whether or not that
gun was going to go off the french were
an excitable race it would be wise he
decided to get that gun out of the way
before he summoned help

  the only court you will see de-
clared provain is a court martial
schlager fool listen war has been de-
clared-war between your country and
mine we are going to avenge eighteen-

seventy we shall not rest till again alsace
and lorraine are french

  im n ally added dilke preening
himself when the british lion starts
to roar-watch out

  schlagers body stiffened his eyes
opened wide his hands closed convul-
sively on the ledger

  what is this he inquired sharply
war has france declared war on
germany

  france is a peaceful country sneered
provain a civilized country no it
is not france which has sought this war-
it is germany the jealous the saber-
rattling germany

  but this talk of revenge of alsace
and lorraine-

  not revenge-punishment thun-
dered provain whoever attacks
france pavs the rose has thorns of
steel

  an unpleasant smile appeared on the
germans face he looked up at dilke
and asked-

  and you-what are you

  im n ally repeated dilke

  this seemed all sufficient he leaned
against the veranda railing and renewed
his courage with the dregs of the cognac
bottle he was careful to put the empty
bottle down beneath the table standing
it in an upright position

  shot day isnt it he remarked try-
ing to relieve the nervous tension which
filled the air stuffy you might say
provain and schlager favored him with
a glance of contempt which made him
blush provain said quietly as if to mark
the contrast between his dignity and
dilkes lack of self-respect

  i hope you will surrender without
making the grand commotion i do not
wish to shoot but i will do my entire
duty

  schlager said nothing he bit his lips
and stared past provain as if he were see-
ing ghosts

  wha d you look at me like that
for protested dilke its a hot day
and you know it im n ally n i can
say what i like n you cant stop me


j d newsom

did i wanna come on this fool trip not
i he appealed to the german i
was soun sleep at two in the morning
and provain comes in and he says
wars been declared were allies
and then he throws napoleon at me
s disgusting

  provain turned toward him angrily

  imbecile he snapped i order you
to be still it is i who am in command

  while his head was averted schlager
suddenly came into action he raised
the ledger above his head and hurled it
at provain it coincided with the pit of
the frenchmans stomach he staggered
back into dilkes arms but he did not
loose his presence of mind he fired in
the general direction of his enemy just
too late however for the latter had
leaped through an open window into the
house he could be heard bellowing at his
staff the sound of his voice had an un-
pleasant ring about it it seemed quite
evident that he did not intend to sur-
render

  im going announced dilke hes
mad

  all your fault wailed provain he
stepped up to the window and emptied
the second barrel of his shot-gun into the
room to keep them quiet he ex-
plained they-

  a scowling black face appeared around
the corner and a black arm heaved a
machete at the frenchman it missed by
inches

  im going repeated dilke

  it seemed to be the wisest thing to do
they ran down the veranda steps and
crashed through a hedge of crotons
from the first-floor balcony a shot rang
out a bullet tore through the leaves and
kicked up a spurt of dust at dilkes feet
they ran on zigzagging across a field
where two cows stood gazing at them
with luminous eyes fearing no doubt
to hurt his cattle schlager held his fire

  a confused noise of shouting came from
the house glancing over his shoulder
provain saw schlagers tall white form
leading a dozen or more kanakas pro-
vain swore bitterly instead of scoring a

decisive victory he was being chased
across the landscape like a rabbit dilke
had thrown away his shotgun and was
running in great bounds his mouth was
wide open his eyes fixed and glassy

  a rifle cracked the bullet whined by
close overhead dilkes speed increased
provain lumbered along close behind him

  they reached the fringe of the planta-
tion and fell into uncut jungle they tore
at it forcing their way in among the rank
undergrowth soon they were flounder-
ing knee-deep in brown ooze clinging to
creepers and roots that were greasy with
mud

  when at last they stopped there was
neither sign nor sound of their pursuers

  mon dieu mon dieu raged provain
but it is running away that we are
running away mon dieu what shame-
fulness

  you-youre quite right panted
dilke and i cant get away fast enough
to suit me

  but we shall go back provain
asserted we shall not let this snake
strike at us when we are off our guard
you see now how perfidious these ger-
mans are he waits until my head is
turned and then assails me o dilke
my friend let us be calm let us think
let us cease this running away

  if i thought i could swim all the way
to kalewara gurgled dilke pressing
one hand to his heart and the other to his
forehead id be on my way and nothing
could stop me-nothing im a peace-
loving drunk he added and the
trouble is im sobering up fast

  provain laid an encouraging hand on
dilkes shoulder

  my good friend he adjured do
not lose faith with sobriety will come
strength not yourself alone do you
represent but england we fight for a
grand civilization if we fail-

   you can keep your grand civilization
dilke said feelingly you can have it
so fars im concerned the wars over
im going to surrender and see if old man
schlager wont bring out some of that
schnapps to celebrate his victory pro-
victory



vain old bean im feeling low
pig of an englishman swore pro-
vain pushing the tum-coat away from
him stay here then and rot i shall
deal alone with this boche

  the turn-coat staggered back against
a tree-trunk tripped against a projecting
root and went over backward he sat
down with a soft plop

   now listen he appealed as soon as he
recovered his breath now old top
listen be fair you cant leave me out
here all alone its growing late and itll
soon be dark and im not feeling at all
well im terribly weak- he gulped
back tears of self-pity-you dont know
how weak i am its the liquor im
all shot to pieces thats what i am
come with me then snapped pro-
vain the strong man i will not
abandon you no but i make one con-
dition you must be courageous re-
member dilke this is war

  uhuh agreed dilke wars right
but land fightings not my style you
get me back on board that launch and i
swear ill join the navy and never touch
another drop in my life

   you will join the navy cried pro-
vain enheartened by this show of patriot-
ism dilke my friend you rise in my
regards this is very fine

it was growing dusk the shadows
thickened beneath the trees and the
mosquitoes came out in full force by the
time they reached firm land darkness
had closed in

  the house of the boche is in dark-
ness whispered provain let us be
 wary no doubt but he lies in wait for
us let us creep up upon him with care
dilke who had been grumbling to him-
self for some time suddenly stopped and
inquired testily-

   do you see it too

   do i see what snapped provain
oh hell moaned dilke ive got
em again

  got what again

dts im seeing things its a sort
of purplish land crab this time you see

what happens when im cut off from my
daily ration darn it i know its not
there but its so confoundedly real

  a purplish land crab repeated
provain who was not used to the ways of
inebriates in the utter darkness but
you are mad

  so-so dilkes voice was shaky
one land crab-two land crabs he
leaped sidewise violently and came down
on provains toes im awfully sorry
he stammered excitedly but-but theres
a large animal a large yellow brute try-
ing to get at me i saw it distinctly
but no declared provain there is
nothing

  but yes there is dilke cried wildly
its trying to get at me i tell you

  the hallucination charged at him again
he yelled and went galloping away
through the darkness plunging straight
ahead of him

  provain shook his head sadly it was
terrible to think that one had such
allies-a drink-crazed people who saw
purplish land crabs in the night

  alone he told himself alone i shall
finish this or die

  and he meant it he slid along
through the rank grass with the stealth
of a rather heavy-footed elephant

  meanwhile dilke terrorized by his
yellow brute charged across field and
ditch yelling for help he fled past
schlagers house and the kanakas mis-
taking him for a spirit of evil went
away without waiting to investigate

  the melanesian is too well acquainted
with the many gods and ghosts who walk
abroad on moonless nights to take any
risks with apparitions which scream like
souls in torment and rush about in search
of human victims those kanakas gave
dilke a wide wide berth

  terror-stricken he shot down the lane
leading toward the landing-stage when-
ever he looked back there was the slaver-
ing yellow brute close at his heels

  dimly he heard a voice shouting at him
but he was past caring about mere
human voices a lick of red flame
bloomed in the darkness there was a


j d newsom

thunderous explosion a hot breath of air
blew past his face all this was part of
his nightmare he raced on-and cata-
pulted into a shadowy figure which barred
his way he went into it head-foremost
and the force of the impact almost broke
his neck

  then he was down sprawling on top
of a man who squirmed and cursed and
tried to shake him off he struck back
blindly immensely relieved because be-
neath him there was a creature of flesh
and blood and the shadowy yellow brute
had vanished

  for a while blows rained against his
face and a pair of bony hands groped for
a hold on his throat but his energy was
tremendous he knelt on his antagonists
chest and pounded him into submission
gradually the mans efforts relaxed he
squirmed a little groaned and lay still

  a great surge of joy swept dilke one
of his eyes was closed his mouth was torn
open two of his teeth were missing but
these were minor accidents he had laid
his ghost and what was still better he
had captured schlager single-handed

  provain he yelled when his breath
returned provain ive got him

  after a time the frenchman appeared
treading cautiously for he feared a trap

  come on urged dilke nothing to
be afraid of old top im sitting on his
chest yo-ho-ho and a bottle of schnappsl
strike a light and see whos here jolly
old schlager brought down in open com-
bat alone i did it

  mon dieul gasped provain groping
about in the darkness is it possible
im sitting on him i tell you not a
peep out of him for the last two minutes
it takes a briton to finish a job old top
be it said withoutoffense- hes squirm-
ing take a look quick

  while provain was fumbling through

his pockets a voice came from beneath
dilke it said shakily

  dilke you drunken swine get up
ill teach you to interfere with an officer
in the execution of his duty im
ormrod

  dilke staggered to his feet and provain
cried-

  mon dieul

  he struck a match and together with
horrified eyes they peered at the victim
despite the blood on his face there was no
mistaking him it wasnt schlager at all
but ormrod the police commissioner

  he sat up cleared his throat and
barked

  whats the meaning of this outrage
i landed an hour ago and arrested
schlager hes on board the cutter this
minute were at war with germany-
we know that broke in provain
sir we were here to arrest him our-
selves

  you leave all the arresting to me
snarled ormrod youre not fit to be
loose either of you what were you up
to anyway

  they tried to explain and he grunted
disgustedly

  ill let you off with a caution because
youre not worth arresting but dont
forget i could have you both up for tres-
pass and assault yunderstand tres-
pass and assault now get out of my
sight both of you-you make me sick
they stood side by side listening to the
retreating footsteps and at last provain
exclaimed

  and that is all the thanks one gets for
ones devotion one is a trespasser and
an assaulter it is odious odious
yes agreed dilke just you come
again at two in the morning and tell me
theres a war on and youll never know
what hit you my word im thirsty
the night-nurse

by

leonard h nason

the night-nurse was one of the best
she was past the years of youth and
no one looking at her would think she
was such a good sport i didnt like her
for a nickel when i first knew her be-
cause she was always waking me up in the
night to give me a shot of dakin solution
the dakin treatment for gunshot
wounds consists of shooting a mysterious
solution into the wound every two hours
this is done with a syringe inserted into
a rubber hose which remains in the wound
all the time a man with a large wound
will have several of these tubes dangling
like an ornamental fringe

  i had a hole in my abdomen seven
inches long with three tubes in it the
solution can not be warmed as heat de-
stroys its efficiency so it was used at
room temperature which in the no-
vember nights was around freezing it
will be seen that my feelings toward any
one who dragged me from sleep every
two hours all winter and filled my stomach
full of that icy stuff would be anything
but loving boy every time i got a shot
of that stuff i thought some one had run
a bayonet through me

  there was a man in the ward with
sixteen tubes in his leg the propeller of
a plane had hit him i pitied that lad

  well after a time they took the hose

out of me and i didnt swear at the night-
nurse any more they put her on day
duty then anyway she used to come in
the ward after supper to swipe a little hot
water off the stove-we had a tiny stove
that furnished heat for a sixty-bed ward
and hot water for the dish-washing and
dressings-and shed stop and chew the
rag with me for a minute

  ive come in to give my man a drink
she used to say displaying a metal hot-
water bag

  one night i was full of gloom and she
sneaked back to her quarters and got me
some port wine i kept the whole ward
awake that night after that she used to
bring me in a toothful of nose-paint every
time she came if theyd ever caught her
shed have got the works one of the
other nurses asked her how come her
partiality for me

  ah replied the night-nurse when
he was sick he used to swear at me just as
f he were my husband i never had a
man swear at me all my life you cant
imagine the thrill it gives

  i wish i could meet that nurse again
theres several nurses id like to meet i
wish they were men one of us would be
a corpse but i would like to see the
night-nurse chances are small i guess
i dont even know her name
the return of a prodigal brother

theti

to go

me

the successive terminal towns
of the atchison topeka and santa
fe were so many lurid explosions
each marked a pause in the crawling
progress of the road across kansas in
each sprang up saloons gambling-places
and dance-halls and the last mushroom
civic growth making the head of the road
for a brief time took over from its prede-
cessor the honor of being the bloodiest
town on the map

  some of these railroad settlements were
dilatory in living up to the required repu-
tation so that there was room for argu-
ment as to which was the liveliest and
worst but in all truth newton harvey
county in  fulfilled all expectations
not only was it the head of the railroad
but also the new terminus of the texas
cattle trail one texan quaintly ex-
pressed it-

  this burg can give hell a two minute
handicap an win in a walk

  perhaps this was an exaggeration yet
the speaker was not kansas-born and was
impartial in his judgment regardless of
individual merits of the various termini
it was unanimously conceded that no rail-
way extension ever was characterized by
more lawlessness than in that of the atchi-
son topeka and santa fe

  among those who had kept up with the
road were joe laws and his pretty wife-
and their portable eating-house almost
from the start his wife mary abhorred
the life when she urged him to go into

some business back east he would point to
the days profits and would insist they
would be foolish to abandon a small
fortune

  at newton however joe found himself
feeling uneasy the town was overrun by
gamblers and sure thing men nearly
all the men were proud of their shooting
ability he began to wonder if his wife
were not far too pretty to take into such
a hodgepodge of recklessness until he
opened his restaurant in newton joe be-
lieved himself capable of defending his
own then came the wild cattlemen with
the first of the forty thousand head that
they were to drive up from texas during
the short seasom they quickly wove a
new viciousness into the red warp and
by hugh pendexter

woof of the town as gunmen they
quickly collided with kansas desperadoes
and the shootings occurred in the street
as well as in the resorts famous gun-
toters were being killed almost daily
joe realized that the six-shooter was the
only law he suggested to his wife that
she go back east

  i wont go unless you go she stub-
bornly told him she was a banner
and all the banners usually meant what
they said

  he thought of the fat receipts for the
day and temporized

  probably weve seen the worst of it
as soon as the rails get a little closer to the
next town this place will quiet down
theyve already named it larned

  and when the rush is made for larned
-youll be keen to go there she asked

  i dont think so mebbe ill call this
our last move but were a lot rougher
here than in any of the other places a
woman was killed in the street by a wild
bullet from tim sheas dance-hall she
was a dance-hall girl but it might have
been youmary i do wish youdgoback
no she quietly told him its no
worse for you to worry about me than for
me to worry about you

  well well wait a few days and see if
it dont quiet down but you mustnt
go out unless im with you

  i never go out except to run into
stillwells store next door

  darned hard on you being cooped up
here and keeping house in that back room
mebbe we wont wait till the rush to
larned comes but ill never get an-
other chance to get big money quick
the girls life was virtual imprison-
ment the eating-house did a lively
business late into the evening she sel-
dom entered the dining-room except in
the early morning hours their living-
room was at the back of the house and all
the partitions were thin she grew to
hate the room but the outside world was
worse the loud talk of drunken des-

peradoes caused her face to bum and
often she lay on the bed with a pillow
muffling her ears she kept that part of
her misery from joe fearing lest he act
the censor did he do that she was
convinced he would be sentencing him-
self to a bloody death

 one night a tall rangy herder
 with butternut pants tucked into
 long boots with two guns in his belt and
 with his mexican hat pushed back from
 his forehead grossly insulted joe the
 mans companions some of whom had
 ridden with quantrell laughed uproar-
 iously joe ate crow to save his self-
 respect he could have made a defiant
 gesture and died at the muzzle of a smok-
 ing gun but there was his wife

   after the reckless group departed he
 went to the back room and broke down
 and wept his wife comforted him or
 attempted to and insisted that words
 ould not hurt him

   but they do they did they hurt
 like- he groaned oh if you only was
 back in burlingame if i could only
 handle guns like hanse

   she grew deadly pale and her eyes
 widened with the old misery instantly
 he was contrite and almost forgetful of
 his wounded pride

    there there dear never went to hurt
 the girl but your brother would be a
 humdinger in a place like this that
 tall devil never would a called him that
 and what has hanses wildness
 fetched him she whispered where is
 he tonight what will be the end of his
 wickedness oh joe if hed only died
 when a little boy to think hes scarcely
 more than a boy this night

joe attempted a defense of the brother-
v in-law whom he had never seen but
whose lawless acts comprised two years of
wild history on a wild border all joe
could say was

    hanse banner can take care of himself
 he could protect a wife if he had one


hugh pendexter

  take care of himself she bitterly
cried scarcely out of his teens and in
hiding most of the time

  hed never stand for what i had to
stand for tonight bitterly insisted joe

 she almost told him what she had
stood for when compelled to overhear
the rough talk on the other side of the
thin partition instead in a flare of
passionate protest she shrilly insisted
take me away take me back east
now leave everything

  believing she was concerned on his ac-
count he quieted his own rage and more
philosophically reasoned

  still im alive i stood for the abuse
i wont care what the rotten scum say
i wear no guns the texan knew it and
he had two so hes the coward that
particular bunch will be pulling out soon
some will remain here planted this
towns going to quiet down we wont
follow the road any farther ill get a
good offer and sell and go back east

  the next few days brought no trouble
to the eating-house the texans had
been running the town for several days
and now the kansas gunmen were plan-
ning to assert their supremacy each
faction was sniffing the impending battle
each was planning to take the other at a
disadvantage

  as joe listened to the gossip at his
tables his hopes were high the ideal
consummation would be for both fac-
tions to be exterminated he hoped the
tall rangy man would not patronize him
again he often pictured himself picking
up the gun behind the counter and
shooting him only the picture persisted
in his going down before a volley from the
mans companions

  as he stood behind the counter dishing
up for the mexican waiter he was always
seeing the man with the low-crowned hat
of enormous brim pushed back and reveal-
ing the lighter complexion of the fore-
head the mans weathered face re-
minded him of a dark red mask but
what was hurting his pride tremendously
was his hesitancy to go out on the street
it was shameful-but there was mary

when it was predicted that the
showdown between kansans and
texans was imminent the latter ceased
their night revels and returned to their
camp hearing this joe ventured forth
late in the afternoon or early evening
and endeavored to make himself believe
he was free to come and go then came
a day when he entered his restaurant
and was horribly shocked to behold his
wife standing on the threshold of their
living room her gaze that of a mad per-
son in her hand held gingerly as if
there were blood on the handle was one
of the revolvers

  with a low cry he ran to her and for a
moment she stared at him as if she did
not recognize him then she pointed to
the floor his eyes were almost as wild as
hers as he beheld-a dark stain

  my god he gasped

  he came to this door she shrilly
said he tried to enter i shot him
youve killed some one he whis-
pered

  she slowly shook her head and backed
into the living-room he followed her and
closed the door she cautiously placed
the revolver on a stand and held her hand
before her face the fingers stiffly spread
apart

  he seized her by the shoulders shook
her roughly and hoarsely demanded
who who who

  she went to the wash-stand and poured
water over her hands although they were
unstained and scrubbed them desper-
ately he stared and waited she told
him-

  the tall texan

  he leaned against the thin partition
and stared at the opposite wall he no-
ticed several old builet-holes he ob-
served that the boards were beginning to
warp and all the while he was telling
himself that he must get a horse and ride
out to the texans camp and do his best to
kill the man of course he never would
come back but it was one of those times
when a man must go when the quest ion
of returning was of little matter with a
little shiver which he tried to disguise by
the time to go



shrugging his shoulders he took the towel
from her and gently dried the slim hands
his voice was quiet almost casual as

ha q olfpn

  where did you hit him

  his left hand he stayed-to wrap
it up he said he would come back

he was frightened by her voice by her
set expression he fiercely commanded
mary you kick out of this spell you
stop it he wont bother you again he
wont come back

  he said hed come she monoto-
nously repeated said hed pay me off by
getting you then hed take me away
she was clapping her hands over her
mouth to stifle a scream she would have
fallen had he not caught her in his arms
he placed her on the bed and said

  ill hunt up a doctor theres one
who hangs out in sheas place

  no no dont leave

  mary i must get a doctor unless you
stop this youve been frightened
youve scared a cheap rascal away you
havent been hurt-just frightened
promise me youll start back east to-
night she whispered

  that means i must give my business
away

  you can sell stillwell would like to
buy you out but give it away-any-
thing only get me out of this

  all right you win get your nerve
back ill make a trade with stillwell if i
can if i cant ill leave it weve
made quite a bit of money well call
it quits theres no chance of that man
coming here again today if youll say
youre all right ill go and fix it

  she eagerly assured him

  im myself im all right the
happiest moment of my life since we
started with the railroad will be when
were traveling back home see my hand
is steady the fears left me go now
give or sell then hurry back

  itll take a bit of time he gently
warned her i must act as if i wasnt
over-keen you know we have plenty of
time no one will bother you while im
gone

  dear ive been weak and foolish
now im all right you stop worrying
now go ill be calm

  he held her at arms length and she
believed he was doubting her ability to
keep up he stared long and earnestly
then kissed her good-by and wheeled
about stepping behind the counter he
watched the closed door picked up his
colt revolver and thrust it under his
coat

  gaining the rough street he walked
rapidly by stillwells store and made for a
small corral back of the hotel where he
knew he could secure a horse and all the
time the thought was parading through
his mind

  you must go even if you cant come
back you cant come back but its time
for you to go

  like one in a trance he heard himself
calmly dickering for the hire of a horse
and insisting on leaving the worth of the
animal like a voice coming from a
great distance he heard the man expostu-
lating

  but doggone you aint goin to
steal this nag laws well well if thats
your notion ill hold the money till you
come back

aws found himself in the saddle rid-
ing from town and keeping wide of
the construction crew he had no plan
he felt no fear he was embarked on the
inevitable he felt cold he felt calm
his thoughts were projected ahead to the
camp of the cowboys he had lost all
sense of self and was impersonal and
ever the refrain-

   you cant return but you must go
his perceptive faculties were dulled
for he was hardly conscious of the grad-
ers shouting profanely to their work-
animals then he beheld a man clinging
to his horses bridle and heard an incisive
voice crying-

  are you deef n dumb

  he blinked at the man standing at the
head of his horse and quietly asked

  see here what do you mean by
stopping me like this
i

hugh pendexter

  im buying your nag stranger hop
down and be smart

  he stared at the man-about his own
age slim of build and wearing two ivory-
handled guns it came into his mind that
he had met the fellow somewhere but
there was the business ahead and he was
not curious

  you mean youre going to take my
horse

  i need the critter moren you do
stranger name your price ill fork
over im no hoss-thief and a hand
dropped on an ivory handle while the
other fished among gold pieces im
mighty hard pressed

  laws felt no resentment against the
fellow all his hatred was concentrated
on the tall texan he said

  i refuse to sell you cant take my
horse by force

  sures youre a foot high im goin
to take your hoss

  theres a time to go even if you cant
come back muttered laws and he lifted
his gaze to stare toward the smoke which
marked the texans camp

  hi whats that time to go you
hit it square on the nail thats why im
goin on your hoss stranger the fellow
laughed recklessly but with a glint of
humor in his dark eyes

  laws puckered his brows there was
no need of mad haste in reaching the
camp the lean brown hand on the big
revolver could draw and shoot him from
the saddle before he could reach for his
own gun he had no desire to shoot
the young man there was only one
crime in the world-the affront to his
wife he patiently said-

  if youll follow me a quarter of a mile
-and ill ride slow-ill give you this
horse

  er-huh just as easy as that
whats the rest of your game dryly
asked the man

  im on my way to the camp of some
texan herders im going to find and
kill one of them he insulted mary
marys my wife

  the hold-up man stared blanklyforabit

  going alone and carrying a fight to a
parcel of bad texans he curiously asked
yes

  then you must be some rare hellion
i must know you by the speech of people
whats your handle

  laws joe laws

  oh laws so its laws eh mum-
bled the man how long you been out
here mr laws

  came along with the road run an
eating-house tall herder talked bad to
me tother evening because of my wife i
stood for it he came this afternoon
while i was out and insulted my wife she
shot him through the left hand i found
her nearly crazy

  the man gaped for a moment and mur-
mured-

  your wife mary-mary laws potted
the bad man

  yes dont repeat things after me
please i promised my wife id go back
east with her this very day she thinks
im out now selling my place of course
she couldnt understand it was a time
when a man has to do a certain thing i
didnt try to explain it but you see how
it is thats what i meant by saying its
time i must go even if there aint any ar-
rangements made for my coming back
im bothering to make this plain to you
so you will understand that i cant give up
my horse i must ride into that camp
hell-for-leather and get my man before
im riddled by his friends

  i see i see fighting joe laws
no no disclaimed laws seriously
ive never claimed to be a fighter run
an eating-house im doing something
now i simply have to do even if it isnt
in my fine

  the man nodded gravely and still
holding the bridle turned and glanced
toward the west

  yeah i can see the smoke from their
cooking-fires facing about he said
im proud to meet such a conscientious
cuss as you be fighting joe laws but
drag your eyes to the south a trifle
those hossmen are texans

  laws shifted his gaze and beheld a
the time to go



compact group of riders heading for
newton they had left the camp while
he was talking with he stranger he
shaded his eyes and studied the man in
the lead there was no mistaking the
tall gaunt figure

  damn youve held me here and
theyve started back to the town theyre
making for my place the man ahead is
the one im after stand clear or-

  he did not finish the threat with
incredible quickness the man yanked
him from the saddle and darted a hand in-
side his coat and plucked forth the revol-
ver and hurled it far to one side then he
was on the horse and galloping on a long
diagonal to reach the town ahead of the
texans he rode well as if part of his
mount and as he rode he recklessly
shotted

  a time to go well lets hope the
goins good with lots of company

  the texans were in no haste and gave
no heed to the horseman passing by on
their left who in turn gave them no at-
tention he entered the town and
hitched his mount in front of the nearest
store of the storekeeper he inquired
the location of laws place securing
the information he took to the middle of
the road and sauntered leisurely toward
the restaurant coming to stillwells
store he surveyed the interior through a
window and then stepped inside when
the proprietor came forward he curtly
explained

  sent by joe laws some texans are
coming to bedevil his wife mary he
wants you to hide her in rour store till
they can be coaxed away theyll be
here soon fetch her in the back way

  with a startled exclamation stillwell
ran through the store and out of the back
door the young man lounged to the
comer of the building and cautiously
peered between it and the eating-house
soon he saw the storekeeper and a young
woman crossing his narrow range of
vision he glanced down the street
none of the texans were in sight

  probly stoppin for a snort of strong
water he mumbled

  he bent low ran between the buildings
and entered the back door of the eating-
house the mexican waiter was just
leaving and jabbered something excitedly
before starting to place the greatest dis-
tance between himself and the restaurant
in the shortest space of time

  whistling softly the young man en-
tered the dining-room and secured an
apron from the counter and tied it over
his guns then he ventured to open the
door of the living-room and for a few mo-
ments surveyed it returning to the
main room he stepped behind the counter
and thrust his hands under his apron and
drew two guns and with the weapons
thus concealed he leaned carelcssly
against the counter and waited

  five of the texans had left their horses
and were coming up the street the
leader had a bandage around his left
hand some distance behind them and
walking with a staggering drunken gait
came joe laws he was nearly exhaust ed
by his long run overhauling laws was a
gaunt sunburned man who was finishing
his third horse and a sixty-mile ride from
the kansas and pacific line

heres a time to go no matter if
you dont come back murmured
the man behind the counter his hands
were under the apron whod thought
of him havin guts enough to believe
that

  he was in a negligent pose when the
door flew violently open and the tall
texan stepped in with four men at his
heels he gave a single glance at the
man behind the counter undoubtedly
taking him to be a waiter

  ill fetch her out hold the young
fellow if he shows up he told his com-
rades

  he was striding the lengt h of the room
to gain the living-room at the back of the
house

  just where jtou low youre headin
for stranger drawled the man behind
the counter

  the tall man gave no heed to the ques-
tion but a bow-legged herder ambled


hugh pendexter

forward there came a metallic click-
click the tall man twisted about and
was infuriated at the waiters show of
resistance one hand had come from
under the apron and was holding a forty-
five with a roar of rage the texan
reached for his gun and barely touched
the handle before the booming crash of
the forty-five was echoed by the crash of
the tall figure strildng the floor

  another echo was the bow-legged mans
gun the waiter jerked about as if struck
a heavy blow and shot the bow-legged
man through the heart the man was
dead before he collapsed to his knees his
hands scraping the edge of the counter
the second gun came into view and the
two guns began answering and silencing
the spurts of flame at the sides and the
front of the room as the waiter leaning
against the counter fired rapidly and
with deadly precision

  the horseman and young laws came
through the smoky doorway as the sur-
vivor of the terrible tragedy sagged half
across the counter he made a futile
effort to cock the left hand gun then he
grinned faintly and greeted-

  howdy sheriff

  laws stared wildly at the slaughter-
house the sheriff ran behind the coun-
ter and wrenched the two guns from the
feebly resisting hands

  hanse banner youve cheated me
youre dying he cried

  the sheriff caught him and eased him
to the floor

  hanse banner jviarys brother
gasped laws as he ran behind the counter
uncertain what to do

  no-good brother mumbled banner

  he robbed the kansas-pacific single-
handed said the sheriff

  oh my god here eomes mary-my
wife his sister groaned laws

  banner made a supreme effort

  im dying he told the sheriff
youve got the loot i dropped have
pity for my sister

  mary laws came through the doorway
and opened her mouth to shriek then she
discovered her husband

  your brother hanse took the fight
away from me he told her and he led her
around the counter

  she gave a little cry as she beheld
hanse then she was on her knees and
lifting his head to her lap-

  my little brother my little brother
she moaned as she bent over him

  his mouth twisted in a little smile as
he recognized his sister

  just dropped in behind some skunks
reckoned id help you folks out after
hearing what they come for glad to
help a bit but you was always right
mary- larn em to suit my sister-
theres a time to go- and he was gone
with the whimsical twisted smile deceiv-
ing them for a few moments

  leaving the girl with her dead laws
took the sheriff aside and whispered
rapidly the officer listened with no ex-
pression on his craggy face he could
have informed laws that his brother-in-
law dead or alive was worth five thou-
sand dollars to the kansas-pacific when
laws had finished the sheriff returned to
the girl and awkwardly twiddling his big
hat in his fingers he told her

  your brother maam had fighting-
guts he was a brave man trifle care-
lessn reckless but nothing to hurt a
straight-shootin brave man we thought
a heap of him up on the kansas an
pacific maam the boys will be sorry he
pegged out this way

  he was a good brother she sobbed
he sent the storekeeper to hide me
then he came in here waited and fought
them all alone

  nerviest damn play i ever see
maam mumbled the sheriff he was
a dead-game wholesome lad the boys
up on the kansas an pacific line will sure
miss him

  he motioned for laws to follow him
as he backed to the front door and he
whispered

  ive got to rustle round right smart
an tear down the reward-notices i put
up if you take her back east at once
shell never know how that young hellion
has pestered me

a wastrel at the wheel

by roy snider

two score great lakes mariners
mostly masters and mates were
congregated in durkees barroom
at oswego new york

  the trade of the place was brisk and
noisy the mariners were jubilant

  a prolonged strike of american coal
miners had ended trainloads of anthra-
cite were on the way to oswego before
noon of the next day the first of the
trains would be switched on the elevated
tracks of the terminal trestles and shortly
thereafter coal would be pouring into the
holds of waiting schooners

  thirty vessels had lain in the harbor
for days-some of them for weeks-wait-
ing for cargoes a coal famine prevailed
throughout the neighboring province of
ontario a canadian fuel-distributing
corporation had offered a reward of five
hundred dollars for the first shipload of
coal to be brought into toronto harbor
and the toronto city council had dupli-
cated the offer

  at that time the port of toronto was
the center of canadas lakewise shipping
interests

  the dual bonus was to be awarded to
the officers and crew of the first vessel
coming into port with a coal cargo of
three hundred tons or more every lake
ontario skipper not otherwise bound by
non-evadable charter purposed to carry
coal to toronto and the prospective
westward racing of the coalfleet promised
to be spectacular and epochal

  the big schooner speedwell a three-
an after-in lake parlance-gill mcgill
master was first at the o  w trestle and
scarcely could be prevented from being
first to load conscienceless masters and
mates had arranged in their own way to
prevent the speedwells being first to enter
toronto harbor

  gill mcgills mate athol owen was
helplessly drunk and effectively stowed

   cockney

 away in a cellar whence he could not es-
 cape until certain paid and instructed per-
 sons allowed him to do so the speed-
 toelvs forward crew had been enticed from
 their ship and copiously plied with the
 beverages which they loved gill mcgill
 and his cook were the only survivors of
 the raid on the schooners complement

 into durkees place came cockney
 joe reputed remittance man and
 wastrel he convoyed a whisky-wrecked
 derelict

   according to prevailing and erroneous
 great lakes custom joe had been nick-
 named cockney simply because he
 was an englishman although the place
 of his birth was leagues beyond the sound
 of bow bells and his early environment
 had been vastly different from that of the
 cockney proper

   joe piloted his dilapidated consort to
 durkees bar the consorts bloodshot
of a great lakes schooner

i

joe r n

 eyes were set in an unseeing stare his
 lower jaw hung slack and saliva drooled
 from his mouth his face bore a ghastly
 bluish hue his body was a-quiver with
 jerky tremors

 joe laid a twenty-five cent piece on the
 bar the bartender glanced at it then
 took appraisive survey of the derelict

 two he asked joe shortly

 joe nodded

both of em for my friend here
he said he looks to me a bit off his
game

 i certainly believe youre right the
 barman retorted with mock -gravity
 in fact im sure you are

 he set out a bottle and glasses joe
 poured a two-ounce glass full of whisky
 and with a bestial sort of eagerness the
 consort derelict essayed to take it his
 outstretched hand jerked and trembled
 violently

 steady on joe adjured him youll

 spill the grizzly stuff and theres precious
 little of it for you hold hard now and
 ill fix you up

  he removed his scarf and passed it half
around his companions neck so that the
ends hung down over the derelicts chest
then he guided the wrecks shaky hands
to grips on the ends of the scarf and placed
the glass of whisky in his right hand

  steady does it he said cheerfully
pull on the kercher with your left and
itll brace your right till you get it to your
mouth

  he bore gently on the others lefthand
the derelict pulled shakily at the scarf
and his right hand clutching the glass
of whisky rose unsteadily to his mouth
the glass rattled hideously against the
teeth as he gulped its contents

  hits right spot the derelict mumbled
thickly feelin tough

  aint you dry joe the bartender
asked mockingly after he had rung up
joes quarter-dollar in the cash register

  dry joe repeated tragically i
know youre joking old chap but isnt
that just a little thick

  the bartender grinned and pushed
bottle and glass toward joe

  help yourself he chuckled it
beats me how a man that likes booze as
well as you do can shoot his last two bits
on somebody else i dont guess you
ever bummed a drink in your life nor run
your face on the strenth of that money
you get every three months

  for twenty seconds cockney joe
looked steadily into the barmans eyes

  i dont believe i ever shall he said
quietly heres health

  he swallowed two ounces of far from
mellow whisky without blinking

eter connors entered durkees
barroom-grouty wealthy bony old
peter connors whose individual ship-
holdings were said to be more extensive
than those of any other owner on the
great lakes


roy snider

  peters shipping and forwarding in-
terests were of huge extent responsible
agents represented him in every worth-
while port from the head of the lakes to
prince edward island his headquarters
office was at toronto business had
called him to oswego

  the speedwell was the only connors
ship in the harbor

  old peter halted inside the doors of
durkees place and looked about every
one of the assembled mariners met his
gaze without hesitation and apparently
without emotion

  they were tough-bitted graceless ruf-
fians all fighting men and all superbly
self-reliant and capable

  peter connors knew that his status as
ship-owner and capitalist weighed but
lightly with them that they gaged his
worth by their own standards and classed
him a good man because he had proven
himself as capable in his own sphere as
the best of them had in theirs

  he would have trusted any one of them
with the charge of his most valuable ship
and a ten-thousand dollar cargo knowing
that only through an act of providence
would the man fail to serve him faithfully
and well he appreciated the mariners at
their full and proper worth

  to business associates who had de-
cried the lakesmens characteristic row-
dyisms he had said

  no better breed of men ever hap-
pened such as they have made great
lakes commerce possible it couldnt
exist without them what would old
pete connors amount to without a pack
of hellions to sail his schooners for
him

  as old peter stood surveying the lakes-
men in durkees place his mouth twisted
into a grim tight-lipped smile

  youve put one trick across he ad-
dressed the assemblage dryly the first
drinks on me liquor up

  chuckling jesting slapping one an-
others brawny backs the mariners
crowded to the bar cockney joe moved
away to give them room and urged his
trembly consort away also

  skippers and mates drank to mr con-
nors wishing him good luck fur-on-
the-chest happy days and sundry
other turns of fortune old peter smiled
and drank with them

  come and bend your elbow he called
to cockney joe after he had paid for the
round of drinks

  joe lounged to a place at the bar beside
the ship-owner thanks awfully mr
connors he drawled im a bit off my
game and i thought id lay off the stuff
for awhile thanks just the same

  busted are you peter connors
asked bluntly well how about a small
loan for thirty days and your i o u for
it im fairly flush myself

  very decent of you and no end handy
for me joe replied fact is im a bit
short of tin

  he accepted two of the five silver dol-
lars which peter connors offered him

  thisll see me over nicely he stated
then he hastily scribbled an i o u and
handed it to the ship-owner

  financed to buy his turn he ordered
a drink

  the whisky-vanquished derelict had
slumped to the floor when cockney joe
left him and now lay inert

  friend of mine joe informed peter
connors nodding toward the sprawled
figure been hitting the stuff too long
and too strong im going to take him to
the ghastly police and have them look
after him hes about to have the
willies

  peter connors glanced at the recum-
bent one

   ill attend to it he said shortly

  hey durkee he called to the pro-
prietor of the saloon call the police
ambulance for that chap on the floor
hell be snakey when he wakes up again

  right mr connors durkee an-
swered promptly i been so busy i
didnt notice him

  old peter connors turned to cockney
joe

  im looking for a crew for the speed-
well he said in a voice loud enough for
any one in the place to hear how about
cockney joe r n



throwing your bag aboard for the run to
toronto

  suits me nicely joe replied fact
is im about due at toronto ill have a
bit of business to attend to there a let-
ter from across the way is coming
he inclined his head toward the east to
indicate the direction of across the way

  as to a bag im traveling a bit light
maynt need more than im standin in
its only a day and a night to toronto in
a decently good fair wind

  listening mariners nudged one an-
other some of them chuckled peter
connors gave them no heed

  you might try and get some more men
for the speedwell he told joe shes
lost her mate and all her forward crowd
theres only the old man and the cook
left aboard then he added with de-
liberate emphasis shes going to take the
first coal into toronto and collect that
thousand-dollar bonus thats offered
the mariners laughed outright as
peter had known full well they would
the confines of the barroom roared with
the volume of their jeers and guffaws

the final ten-ton draught of a
seven - hundred - ton cargo rattled
down the loading chute and into the
speedwells hold a tug lay alongside the
schooner ready to move her away from
the dock

 cockney joe and four nondescript
vagabonds stood about the speedwells
deck joe had recruited the vagabonds
by way of a crew or rather one of them
had accosted him on the dock expressed
a willingness to go sailin  and volun-
teered to induce the other three to ac-
company him which joe considered a
stroke of good fortune

  a little scow-built schooner warped
alongside the speedwell forward of the tug
her master came on board the larger vessel

  say capn he addressed gill mc-
gill would it be all right for me to tow
out with yuh its kind of hard gittin
out of here in a noreast breeze an billy
ferris here on the tug he says hell put
me clear of the piers for a dollar if i tow

alongside of you hell charge me five if
he tows me out alone do yuh mind if
i go out with yuh

  gill mcgills mind was occupied with
other matters he only partly compre-
hended the mans request

  all right he answered shortly
then he called to cockney joe start the
mizzen

  the covers of the sails already had been
removed and the gaskets had been cast
off cockney joe led the vagabonds aft
half a dozen sailors leaped on board the
speedtvell from the dock

  all right capn one of them sang
out well help you make canvas as you
tow out and come back on the tug

  thats the ticket boys one of the
schooner masters standing on the dock
called out approvingly get under way
gill and give the rest of us a chance to
load

  men were already casting off the
speedwells mooring lines the six volun-
teer sailors went strenuously to work
making canvas a bell clanged in the
tugs engine-room the speedwell moved
away from the dock

  clear of the harbor pier-ends with all
her lower cloth set and the gaff topsails
out of stops the big schooner heeling to
a fresh northeast wind commenced to
pick up her way

  the tugs engine slowed one ofthe
six sailors cast off her stern line and
jumped aboard with his companions
cockney joe let go the tugs bow line
gill mcgill was at the schooners wheel
the four vagabonds rushed forward cast
off the lines of the scow-schooner and
with derisive yells leaped to the smaller
vessels deck the six sailors on board
the tug roared jeering laughter

  cockney joe walked aft along the lee
alleyway

  it looks as though the blighters in-
tended to desert when they joined us
sir he remarked in a slightly nettled
tone to gill mcgill no doubt those
moldy chaps ashore put them up to it
itll be a bit stiff for the two of us to sail
her to toronto what


roy snider

  gill mcgill stared at him wide-eyed
sail her to toronto he repeated
my awful gosh man youre crazy as a
hellgramite

  a-quite likely joe retorted in
fact i must be and as i was about to
say those worms who put up the putrid
game on you would be no end bashed if
you should sail her up the lake in spite of
them

  with her engine turning at half speed
the tug held her forward way close to the
schooners weather quarter the grinning
tug-master ready to come alongside again
to tow the speedwell back to harbor as
soon as he should receive the hail of dis-
tress which he felt assured gill mcgill
must utter the treacherous little scow-
schooner was already bearing away for
the harbor-mouth

  for a moment gill mcgill stared non-
plussed at cockney joe then with his
right hand he smote his chest mightily

  by the pawls of satans patent
winch he yelled well do it blast
their stinkin souls well show them
here take the wheel a minute while i
tell them yellow hound-hatched scum
what i think of them

  he relinquished the wheel to joe and
stepped to the quarter rail to deliver an
oration that stung even the superlatively
callous sensibilities of the tugs crew and
the six sailors

  while yet he reviled and denounced the
speedwells cook came on deck he was a
plump middle-aged negro with a peg
leg he stumped to the lee rail and peered
overboard

  hey he shouted turning his face
toward the quarter deck  yous a dam-
fool captain an a drinkin english bum
im swimmin back to oswego while the
swimmins good an safe

  forthwith he vaulted over the rail and
plunged into the lake

  captain excuse my interrupting you
cockney joe addressed gill mcgill
the lurid cook has deserted i fancy the
perishin tugll pick him up

  gill mcgills profane oration ended at
once

setting the schooners gaff topsails
was a slow but not particularly labori-
ous undertaking for one man passed
under thumb-cleats the halyards tacks
and sheets of the fore and maintopsails
were long enough to be carried to the
nigger-heads of the donkey-engine which
performed a creditable job of hoisting and
sheeting home while cockney joe held
slack and the expedient of preliminary
stopping of the gear with selvagee strops
facilitated the work of belaying

  a messenger was employed to sup-
plement the lengths of the various units
of the mizzentopsail gear

  when the vessel was finally under full
sail gill mcgill held council with cock-
ney joe while he steered

  youre an awful damn fool for gettin
me into the notion of goin up the lake
so short-handed he asserted im a
considerably damder one for listenin to
yuh but thats neither here nor there
now that we got started

  joe nodded

  quite likely he agreed and-a-
that bonus of two hundred quidll come
handy dont you think

  thats just the point said gill mc-
gill but not in the way you might
think i mean

  i dont rightly belong here on fresh
water i started my goin to sea in the
united states navy i was bosun when
i left

  indeed joe breathed politely

  these lake fellows dont hardly con-
sider me one of themselves mcgill con-
tinued i dont mean that theyve
got it in for me or anything like that
theyd of put this lousy trick over on any-
body else thatd happened to be first at
the trestle if they could and thought
nothin of it theyre a rough crowd but
good-natured as hell when yuh know how
to take them nothin small or mean
about em if we get this hooker into
toronto ahead of them theyll honor us
for it an be ready to lick anybody that
says a word against us

  so will we said cockney joe in
fact wed have every right to
cockney joe r n



  we certainly would and would gill
mcgill agreed but itd go wider an
amount to more if it was to come out that
it was a navy-trained man that done the
trick an not just gill mcgill do you
get what i mean

  i certainly do cockney joe asserted
warmly i say now thats real cricket
mcgill eyed him queerly

  i havent heard that word for a long
time he said not since i was in the
united states sloop-of-war essex

  the essex joe exclaimed i say
were you at ber- he stopped abruptly
a flush mounted his cheeks a-i-yes
i believe i heard somewhere that youd
served in the essex a very smart ship
ive been told

  the steering of the schooner demanded
all of mcgills attention for the ensuing
two or three minutes when he had the
vessel steadied on her course he looked
astern

  theres three vessels leavin harbor
together he observed thatll be the
ella merton the dolphin and the arctic
theyre loaded for kingston and wont
bother us any the next twoll be bound
for montreal and the emerald  load at
the same time they do shes bound for
toronto and shes the one that we got
to look out for well ony have an hours
start of her

  this one has the heels of her hasnt
she cockney joe asked

  she has in a way mcgill explained
with the wind abeam or full-an-by this
old girlll run away from any of em the
emeralds got square canvas forard you
know foresl foretopsl an bat-wings
in a followin wind that stuff pulls better
than any fore an aft sails do emerald 
beat this lady runnin free

the speedwell was eight miles out of
oswego when the emerald cleared
emerald was of about the same tonnage as
speedwell besides her fore-and-aft fore-
sail and fore gaff topsail she carried a
supplementary square foresail and a big
single topsail with triangular bat-wings
set above it in great lakes idiom she

was known as a square three-and-after
and was of a type fairly common in the
lake marine

  the brisk northeast breeze went down
w ith the sun after carrying the speedirell
westward to a point abreast of charlotte
new york and about ten miles offshore
for half an hour after sunset the vessel
barely held steerage wray then the airs
petered out entirely and she lay be-
calmed

  little more than a mile astern of her
the emerald drifted under lazily flapping
cloth while farther to the eastward
there were four schooners in a group and
two more in sight hull down on the hori-
zon

  theyre strung out all the way from
here to oswego by now gill mcgill
averred theres five more that i know
of waitin for coal at charlotte lucky
for us that they didnt get the railroads
haulin to charlotte first its half a day
closer to toronto than oswego is

  he was walking uneasily back and
forth on the quarter

  winds goin to the westward he
predicted if it holds off till midnight
itll blow hard i hope to heck it dont
how could us two reef her if it was
breezin anyways stiff

  it would be a bit awkward cockney
joe admitted but i fancy wred wangle it
somehow he looked appraisively aloft
mightnt it be just as wrell to snug her
down for it in case w e do get a blow he
suggested

  maybe it would mcgill agreed
lets go to it

  while they were aloft stowring the ga ff
topsails they observed that the emeralds
canvas was also in process of being short-
ened

  we aint makin no mistake gill
mcgill declared old sam malcolm
that sails the emerald is a wreather-wise
hound hes got considerable advantage
in havin a crew to get the rags on her
again when he needs them though
after somewhat more than two hours
hard work the speedwells spread of sail
was reduced to forestaysail and reefed

fore and mizzensails her mainsail had
been taken in and stowed

  gill mcgill and cockney joe rested
sitting on the cover of the after hatch

  we was talkin about that word
cricket joe gill mcgill commenced
speaking when i was in the essex we
was at bermuda one time and there was a
british man-o-war on station there
called the thunderer we figured we had
the crack cutter crew of the world in
the essex and the thunderers crowd had
the same idea about a boat crew of theirs
we never had a chance to prove which
was wrong until one day the essex first
lootenant was goin ashore and so was the
thunderers-they call it lefftenant in the
british navy

  anyway the essex cutter with its
crack crew got away a little ahead of the
lime-juicers and rowed kind of slow for
them to catch up when they was
abreast they went to it boys-o-boys
how them two crews did yank their oars
the two coxns was urgin them our
lootenant was kind of leanin forward ex-
cited and encouragin the boys thebrit-
ish lefftenant just sat there in his boat
as if he didnt know there was anything
special goin on and wasnt no ways inter-
ested anyhow them two big boats was
fairly leapin out of the water at every
stroke of the oars they rowed exactly
even for half a mile and then our number
two mans oar broke-snapped clean off

  now ordinarily youd say that the
race was lost right there because seven
ears hadnt a ghost of a show against
eight but no sir that english lefftenant
must of had eyes like a hawk and a mind
like a steel trap because just the second
that that oar broke he snaps out at his
number two man-

  toss oar number two

  that number two musta beenamind-
reader or somethin he had his oar tossed
the minute the officer spoke

  the essex lootenant didnt hardly
know what to make of it for a second or
two but he was a quick-witted feller and
he salutes that english chap the lime-
juicer returns the salute and keeps on

lookin as if he wasnt interested the
coxn of the thunderers boat grins at ours
and says cricket what 

  cockney joe cleared his throat

  that was a grand go with the oars
he said enthusiastically i never saw-
we went alongside the landing stage
exactly even gill mcgill finished his
tale neither one of them boat crews
was the best

  joe arose from his sitting posture went
to the side and drew a bucket of water
from which he drank copiously when he
returned to the hatch mcgill stretched
out for a nap with a muttered suggestion
that joe do likewise

the calm prevailed for half the
night shortly after midnight the
wind came strong and growling from the
westward close-hauled on her port tack
the speedwell lay over to it and forged
ahead pointing northwest by west

  the breeze rose quickly beyond half a
gale and kicked up a heavy lump of sea

  in less than an hour a full gale blew and
the schooner went thrashing to windward
carrying all the cloth she could comfort-
ably drag

  she held her port tack until some tfme
after daylight when the north shore of the
lake was in plain sight then she went
about and stood away on her starboard
tack her lee bulwarks buried and her for-
ward deck deluged with the water of
boarding seas

  hull down astern and to leeward an-
other vessel labored in the gale

  thats the emerald gill mcgill de-
clared she cant begin to go to wind-
ward with this one nor stand the sea that
this one can sam malcolmu nose her
into shelter somewhere we got a little
edge on him now

  mcgill and cockney joe spelled each
other at the wheel and on deck watches
and managed to produce indifferently pal-
atable food in the galley both were
weary and in need of sleep

  joe spoke feelingly of the potent prop-
erties of the whisky of which he was de-
prived
cockney joe r n



  during the forenoon the wind abated
somewhat hauled to the southwest and
headed the schooner off then it swung
back to the west and breezed up again in
greater volume than before

  when they picked up the south shore in
the afternoon the speedwell was making
rather bad weather of it and had com-
menced to leak

  looks like we gotta run in somewhere
an ride it out gill mcgill admitted
morosely maybe shell fetch oak
orchard

no other vessel was in sight on the lake
theyve all got a bellyful of it he
averred theyd run back to charlotte

them that was to windard of it and others
has all ducked in somewhere emeralds
most likely headin for charlotte right
now

  cockney joe rubbed his chin and
frowned

  itd be a bit awkward for us to run in
for shelter anywhere wouldnt it he
said port authorities would never let
us out again without a crew which ill
wager we couldnt get before the slitherin
emerald or some of the rest of them were
so far on their way to toronto that wed
be bally harmless

  mcgill scowled and shrugged his shoul-
ders

  it seems to me i heard that you got a

new forestaysail when you were at os-
wego joe said and i believe you have
a mainstaysail that you tried a while back
and found was too unhandy ive a no-
tion we might bend them on an-
bend em on for trysls and ride it out
hove to mcgill interrupted jubilantly
gosh i never thought of that-an me
a deepwater man well rig the main-
stays instead of the foresl and bend the
new forestaysl on the mizzen

it was gruelling work for two men
cockney joe performed the greater por-
tion of the work mcgill perforce devo-
ting no small portion of his time to steering
and hoisting with the donkey-engine

  the forestaysail was temporarily taken
in while the mizzen was lowered and the
new forestaysail improvised as a storm
trysail set in its place the vessel fell off
under the urge of the forward trysail and
wallowed sickeningly in the trough of the
sea she responded sluggishly to the pull
of the inadequate after trysail and took a
distressingly long time to come up the
forestaysail was hoisted again reefed to
balance the reduced after cloth the
wheel was lashed hard over-and the
miracle was accomplished

  the speedwell rode comfortably and
passably easily four and a half points off
the wind and with her canvas boarded
from the port side

  by the holy rudder gudgeon gill
mcgill swore admiringly shell ratch
across the lake and fetch away to wind-
ward of where we went around on the
other tack

  cockney joe shook his head

  sorry he said but im afraid she
wont s a fact that very few people
really understand the drift of a vessel
hove to she doesnt make headway as
youd think she doesnt actually make
any sternway either but she does go edg-
in off sidewise and as she doesnt lie dead
in the wind she goes quarterin a little
too specially one of these shallow-draft
lake craft i believe theyre the only ves-
sels of their size in the world that have
center-boards

  mcgill regarded him thoughtfully
maybe they are he said and prob-
ably youre right about the matter of
drift but im darn sure of one thing you
never learnt that on the lakes-nor in a
focsle either

  joe laughed shortly

  no i-a-didnt learn it on the
lakes he said i-a-a fellow doesnt
always remember just where he does pick
up these things

  gill mcgill smiled shrewdly

  in the british navy fr instance he
hinted say he exclaimed on sudden
impulse i aint the kind to butt in on
any mans private affairs but ill put it
this way the first lefftenant of the
thunderer was a man named travers
the captains name was otterby they
didnt get along at all otterby was mean
an dirty

  they was up at the admiralty house
in bermuda at one of the official feeds
both drinkin quite a lot ive been told
captain otterby said somethin rotten
about travers sister done it purposely
to rile travers figurin that as he was
ranking officer the lefftenant darent do
anything about it but he was wrong
travers waded into him and give him the
beatin of his life right there in admiral-
ty house before all the officers and high
mucky-mucks

  he done right otterby had it cornin

to him the lefftenant lost his commis-
sion over it-cashiered they call it he
refused to apologize or explain or any-
thing else of course i dont know what
become of him afterwards anyway that
captain otterby was a skunk

  cockney joe nodded

  he was all of that he said quietly
he was the only british officer i ever
knew that was moldy

  he turned away abruptly walked for-
ward and busied himself with the coil of
the fore throat halyards mcgill watched
him thoughtfully

  ive been pretty dumb the speed-
wells skipper muttered to himself been
tryin all along to think where id seen
him before i guess i know who he is
now all right englishmen is mighty hard
to understand

  after a spell at the pump the two
a weary mariners rested sitting once
more on the cover of the after hatch

  well shake up some grub and then
take a snooze while the chance is good
gill mcgill proposed lord knows we
need some sleep

  and a nip cockney joe added
naively fancy a man askin me yester-
day if i were dry

  mcgill stepped to the forward doorway
of the cabin and paused with one foot on
the coaming he commenced to speak
with his head half-turned toward joe

  youd better-

  the schooner lurched suddenly mc-
gill swung sidewise tripped over the
coaming and fell down the two companion
steps into the cabin

  joe sprang up and hurried to the door-
way

  hurt he asked

  mcgill groaned attempted to rise and
slumped back on the deck of the cabin

  my leg he gasped feels like i
busted it

  his left leg was broken the fracture
was below the knee

  cockney joe exhibited a good working
knowledge of the proper manner of set-
ting splinting and bandaging a fractured
cockney joe r n



limb which appeared in no way to sur-
prize gill mcgill

  navy way he muttered when the
waning of the agony permitted coherent
utterance officer has to learn how to
do everything

  too bad it happened just now joe
commented briefly rather awkward
annoying in fact we could do with a
little brandy now set both of us right
throughout the evening the gale blew
fiercely night came and the god of the
west wind relaxed not

  joe kept fitful all-around watch taking
occasional spells at the pump firing the
donkeys boiler when necessary observing
and calculating the vessels drift as best
he could between spells he slept

  at shortly after three oclock in the
morning he awakened from one of his cat-
naps noted that the force of the gale was
unabated tried the pump shoveled coal
into the fire-box of the donkey and lay
down to sleep again

  the hiss of steam escaping from the
donkey boilers safety-valve awakened
him the sun of a new day was half
above the horizon less than five miles
away over the port bow joesaw the loom
of the ontario shore line

  winds shifted he exclaimed corn-
in out of the nothard

  the wind had swung to the north and
had abated to the proportions of half a
gale a sea already making from the
northward was chopping across the great-
er run from the west

  joe closed the drafts of the donkey
boiler saw that there was no lack of
water then went aft and released the
wheel from its beckets he slacked away
the mizzensheet the schooner promptly
payed off and gathered forging way

  joe put the helm hard down and brought
her around on the starboard tack then
he let the mizzensheet run off and after
making it fast went forward and eased
off the sheets of the forward trysail and
the forestaysail next he climbed out on
the horn and cast off the stops of the jibs

  the speedwell wallowed sluggishly into
the westerly sea steering herself erratically

  cockney joe returned inboard from the
jib-boom went aft again and found a pair
of marine glasses

  i dont know much about this blessed
shore he muttered to himself but may-
be ill have the luck to pick up something
in the way of a landmark thatll put me
right

  studying the shore line through the
glasses he discovered six or seven miles
to the northeast a squat wooden light-
house and the piers of a harbor entrance

  thatll be port hope he soliloquized
hm-m the old gal has done better
than i expected her to i figured wed
fetch ten miles farther down the frigid
lake not bad at all

  he awakened gill mcgill in his little
stateroom

  its after daylight captain he re-
ported were about five miles off the
north shore and six or seven miles to the
westard of port hope winds died to
half a gale and shifted to the nothard
itll be well abaft the beam for the run to
toronto dye suppose if i carry you on
deck an make you snug in a chair you
could manage a go at the wheel while i
get the perishin canvas on her

  mcgill regarded him with unfeigned
surprize 

  off the north shore above port hope
he pondered why say shed fetch
port hope harbor on her port tack from
here wouldnt she

  i hardly think it joe answered be-
lieve shed look moren half a mile to
looard of the piers from here

  mcgill emitted a grunt

  theres nothin to stop us goin around
off the pier-ends makin a short hitch in-
shore and reachin in on the next tack is
there he demanded testily

  a-certainly not joe admitted do
you think you can manage a go at the
wheel

  when mcgill was at the helm in as
comfortable a position as circumstances
permitted joe brought forth the glasses
for another survey of the shore line what
he beheld caused him to shout

  blast me theres a vessel coming out


roy snider

of port hope harbor under sail a square
three-an-after as i live its that dia-
bolical emeraldhe turned to gill
mcgill toronto what he queried
laconically

  mcgill nodded

  nothin else for it he said bruskly

  taking off the storm trysails and get-
ting up normal cloth while the schooner
rolled and wallowed in the cross sea was
an enormous job for cockney joe to un-
dertake aided though he was by the
sturdy donkey-engine when the final
unit of the lower canvas was set and draw-
ing properly he was dripping perspira-
tion breathing heavily and feeling rather
shaky in his legs gill mcgill was gasp-
ing at the helm

  the emerald under all her lower can-
vas was less than two miles astern

  kin yuh take er joe its killin
me the speedwells master groaned
gimme five minutes spell to catch my
wind

  joe took the wheel

  w-winds lightin a little he panted
well break out the topsls directly

manned by a full crew the emerald
had her upper cloth set and had re-
duced the distance between the two ves-
sels by half a mile before joe got the
speedwells kites spread thereafter the
emerald came no closer

  for hours the two vessels raced up the
lake holding their respective positions
without change cockney joe worked
heroically gill mcgill endured agonies
in striving to be of assistance

  the schooners were-abreast of the scar-
boro highlands ten miles or so northeast
of toronto when the breeze commenced
to fall the speedwell was less than two
miles off the eastern channel piers of
toronto harbor when the breeze left her
entirely

  light airs favored the emerald for some
time longer and she crept up to within
a quarter of a mile of the speedwell before
she was becalmed

  the schooners were flying their respec-
tive burgees signaling for tugs three

tugs were coming out of toronto harbor
under full steam

  gill mcgill watched the oncoming tow-
boats through the glasses

  first ones the dauntless he an-
nounced shes a mathews line tug
same line as the emerald shell run past
us and pick up the emerald of coursc
next ones the cascade shes one of
peter connors and shes damn sure to
come to us the last one thats cornin
is the frank jackman an independent
i dunno what her skipper expects to do
with two company tugs ahead of him

  the tugs came on speedily the
dauntless rushed past the speedioell a
hundred yards away tons of disturbed
water piling about her bows her wake a
foamy swirl less than a hundred feet
astern of her raced the cascade her
master signaled to gill mcgill pointed to
frank jackman and gesticulated toward
the dauntless

  i see what hes up to mcgill cried
hes goin to keep the dauntless away
from the emerald until the frank jack-
man picks us up theres old pete con-
nors on board the jackman and hes got a
crew along with him to help us take her
in trust old pete every time

  the dauntless came abreast of the
emerald and swung in a half-circle to
come alongside the cascades master al-
tered his helm to bring his tug between
the dauntless and her prospective convoy
then there ensued one of the jockey-
ing contests which were common to the
lake tugs of the period the cascades
master strove to keep the dauntless away
from the emerald the skipper of the
dauntless maneuvered to evade the cas-
cades interference	j

  the frank jackman swung in a semi-
compass and came up on the speedwells
weather quarter old peter connors
scrambled on board the schooner while
cockney joe was taking the tugs bow
line five sun-tanned stalwarts who were
grouped on the jackmans forward deck
made no move to assist in any way

  these boysll come aboard and help
get the canvas off her as soon as youre
cockney joe r n



 through the piers peter connors
 shouted to gill mcgill indicating the five
 stalwarts the bonus goes to the officers
 and crew you know might be a hitch if
 anybody helped to bring her in im
 payin these boys good an high theyre
 all satisfied

    he was walking aft as he talked

   gosh whats happened he cried
 when he caught sight of mcgills ban-
 daged leg

    busted it gill informed him briefly
 joe set it he brought the vessel up the
 lake alone hes a crackin good man
 is joe

   when the tugs fines were fast her
 skipper belled the engine full ahead and
 then whistled a signal to the cascades
 master who desisted from his interfering
 with the dauntless and came steaming to-
 ward the speedwell

the speedwell passed into toronto har-
 bor full twro hundred yards ahead of the
emerald as soon as she was through the
piers the five stalwarts came on board
and turned to taking in canvas

   immediately after the schooner was
 docked cockney joe approached peter
 connors

   if you wouldnt mind mr connors
 id like to have a little advance five dol-
 larsll do me nicely i want to go
 ashore for a drink an a mug-up an
 maybe a couple more drinks an a bit of
 food

   peter connors gave him five dollars
 without comment

   thanks awfully cockney joe said
 hastily look for me back inside an
 hour forthwith he hurried ashore

    old peter sighed and shook his head

    funny sort of duck he muttered

    in the seclusion of the speedwells cabin
  gill mcgill talked long and earnestly with
  peter connors and the subject of his
  discourse was joe

    peter connors listened attentively oc-
 casionally nodding or shaking his head or
 uttering a word of comment

    i read about the affair he said when
  gill had had his say i remember seeing
  the picture with the caption first lieu-

 tenant joseph beverly travers r n

i never guessed that it was cockney joe
although ive often wondered who he
really is that captain otterby of the
thunderer was an out and out no-gooder
he was all of that and worse gill
mcgill asserted

  anyway joe is a linging good sailor
and a whole man and well get him
squared away again to another start he
deserves it old peter connors declared

ockney joe returned to the
speedwell in exuberant mood bathed
barbered fed to repletion and plainly
stimulated by whisky

  weve just been talking about you
joe peter connors announced ab-
ruptly you can have the mates berth
in this vessel

  joe rubbed his chin and evinced embar-
rassment

  a-its kind of you mr connors i
appreciate it awfully he said

  but you know im a bit of a drifter-
rather lazy in fact i like to loaf about
and-a-do as i please dont care for
responsibility and all that i saved a bit
of money at one time you know and
came into a little when my uncle passed
out bought an annuity a hundred an
fifty pounds a year cut up in quarters to
make it handy with that an what little
work i do i get along quite cozy

  he paused noting the skeptically
tolerant looks with which his hearers re-
garded him

  i-a havent a mates license he
ended somewhat lamely

  do you think youd have much trouble
getting one peter connors inquired
with mild sarcasm

  possibly not said cockney joe
never thought much about it but i be-
lieve i might wangle it my discharge
from the navy might help i rated quar-
termaster when i left

  you rated what peter connors and
gill mcgill cried in chorus

  quartermaster joe repeated war-
spite was my last ship captain suther-
lawn retired now


roy snider

  he addressed an amiable remark to
gill mcgill

  i was no end intrested when you told
about the old essex and the thunderers
cutter crew the thunderers chaps
rowed a tie with the war spites crack crew
at the fleet regatta just a while before
that i coxd the war spites boat all i
could do to keep from cutting in and tell-
ing you about it almost did in fact
but of course it wouldnt have been
sportin to have spoilt your yarn like
that

  gill mcgill and old peter connors re-
garded him dumbly both knew that the
man they called cockney joe was telling
and acting a great lie and the heart of
each of them warmed to him strongly
because they understood why the man
was lying

  after a pause old peter connors asked
deferentially-

  would you mind telling us who you
are he knew that he would not be
answered truthfully

  why not at all cockney joe re-
joined with perfectly simulated mild sur-
prize at the form of the request names
blakely as you know i was born at
chichester in sussex went to school at
saint winnifreds my governor was a
solicitor i started to read law with him
but chucked it up and went to sea im
an only son my folks are all gone
now

  ostensibly enlightenment came to
him

  oh i say he exclaimed did you
gentlemen suppose that i was lieutenant
travers my word id have put you
right in a jiffy if id known never
imagined it on my word of honor though
i was a bit puzzled once over something
that captain mcgill said to me went
away an messed about with the perishin
throat halyards to try an get it clear in
my head what he meant

  captain mcgill indulged in a self-
deprecatory grimace

  what became of lefftenant travers
he asked uncomfortably

  hes plantin sugar at barbados

doin very well at it cockney joe in-
formed him readily

  gill mcgills mind failed to form a
thought for which he could find coherent
expression

  shrewd old peter connors retained the
services of a legion of men he knew all
sorts of all classes of men and he knew
as he looked- at cockney joe that this
man could never be squared away to a
new start

  joe he said slowly youre a linging
good sailor no matter what else you are
or have been and youre mate of the
speedwell as soon as you want to be and
for as long as you want the berth

  thanks said joe without great en-
thusiasm ill have a try at gettin a
lurid mates ticket and now he ab-
ruptly switched to another subject of
consideration if you dont mind id like
to go ashore again to see about the draft
for this last quarter  ill remember the
little account mr connors and a-
thanks awfully five dollars advance an
the chit for two dollars at oswego by
when cockney joe had gone gill mc-
gill said dull- to old peter connors-
he wont draw a sober breath now
till hes spent the last nickel of his remit-
tance money

  isnt it horrible when they broke
him in the navy he went down so bad that
he doesnt even want to get up again
they smashed everything there was in
him

  old peter connors shook his head
nearly everything but not quite
he amended theres nothing on earth
that could effect his regard for the honor
of his name if you crucified him for it
he wouldnt admit that hes lieutenant
travers gone wrong

  mcgill nodded

  youre right he said its the first
time in my life that i ever admired a man
for telling a bare-faced lie

  they were silent for a minute or two
then old peter connors spoke softly
first lieutenant joseph b travers
r n alias cockney joe a gentleman
under either name

expedition

by gordon maccreagh

a full days trek brought
us to the end of this lake

-by which i judge its
length to be twenty-five miles

here living on top of a steep
slate shale outcrop a natural
robber-baron fortress was that
other german pioneer the her-
mit who paid six dollars a year for his
labor

  this was the man who did not want to
sell out and no wonder-he has an es-
tate of some three square miles bordering
on the lake during twenty years of
unremitting labor he has built for himself
-or rather has transplanted and grown
for himself-a six-mile corral of candela-
bra cactus thick impermeable a de-
fense against hyenas-or elephants-
and here he keeps his three hundred head
of cattle and a herd of ostriches

  an astonishing sight is this green
mathematical square subdivided into
smaller squares seen from the top of the
robber roost he has a windmill to draw
him water from the lake he has coffee

notes
from the
field

or cotton or whatever he
chooses to plant and he plans
to build him a motor-truck
road to the railroad and so to
furnish butter to a starved me-
tropolis where three hundred
europeans yammer for it he
talks too of an ice-house and
fish from the lake for those hungry white
folks to whom a half-smoked and sun-
dried native catfish is a treat

  with an old schuetsen rifle he has
hunted the surrounding country just
about clean his talk is of kudu on the
near-by hills and of various african bok
and beeste on the plain but

  let me see he says in reminiscence
that was in sixteen or seventeen when
that war was going on in europe yes
i killed the last hartbeeste in july of
seventeen

  he reads kant and blavatsky and he
embarks upon no journey or venture with-
out first consulting a galla witch-doctor
on the omens he was waiting for us a
witch-woman had cast the stones for him

 


gordon maccreagh

and told him that white men were coming
and-unguessable even-a white woman
so he had a great bowl of curdled milk
ready as a thirst-quencher for the guests

  no quite distinctly he does not want
to sell but says he wistfully he might
consider a partner with a little capital for
that motor-truck

  here was exciting news about our
hippo a river runs from this first lake
into the one which we had been aiming
for a steep-sided stream ten miles long-
bull-ullu it is called by the gallas be-
cause it bubbles along which means also
that it must therefore be shallow well
our hippo had come up this waterway but
a few days ago to visit a lady acquaintance
of the upper lake who had been moaning
mournfully for company for the past two
weeks and he had only yesterday night
started back warned without doubt by
the anu the protective water spook that
looks after hippo interests yet if we
were to make an offering to the anu and
were to hurry we might possibly be
lucky enough to catch the beast in the
shallows of the river before he should get
to the deeper fastness of his own lake

  was it due to the cunning of the anu
or was it sheer native dumbness that de-
layed this information till it was too late
in the day to pull up stakes and start on
a long stalk down along the river bank
not till an hour before sundown did the
story come to us which meant that
nagadis even though we had driven them
with whips would not have been loaded
and ready to start till two hours after
dark so we were forced to lose that
chance and stay over night in camp

  and that night all the hyenas that had
been wishing for the past few years that
they could get into that cactus corral
came and howled round our camp
which meant again that it was with a
train of raggedy nervous mules and irri-
table nagadis that we made a late start
the next morning

  we drew blank on the river-the anu
had worked well-and it was afternoon
again when we camped on the outskirts
of a galla village at the point where the

bulbullu ran into the lake or rather a
mile and a half distant from the waters
edge for this was our hippos home
lake the lake we had come so far to visit
and a mile at least so the natives said
was the beasts feeding range and they
had learned to live well beyond that
limit

  that information didnt come until
late again and it took the rest of the
afternoon to establish friendly relations
with the suspicious natives it was nec-
essary first to send a boy with offers of
backshish and to buyasmoked-blackened
earthen potful of the dirtiest sour milk
in the world from the ugliest old woman in
the village and to consume all of it-to
prove our good-will before we could get
down to small-talk with the men folks and
what was important to us with the local
hunter

  oh yes he told us the big gumare had
come home yesterday afternoon splash-
ing through the shallow river like a herd
of cattle and was now sleeping not far
from the river mouth at dusk he would
come out to feed and he the hunter
would show us exactly where if we would
first give him a backshish of five car-
tridges

  jim knew all about cartridge currency
and had brought along a big belt full
these are cartridges made to fit the old
gras rifles of which there are so many
in the country-about  caliber they
look to be and they pass as small change
at the rate of five or six to the abyssinian
dollar in far-away places where money
will not be accepted under any circum-
stances it does not matter that there
may not be any sort of a rifle in a commu-
nity spread over a days march in any
direction these gras cartridges are good
for a goat or three or four fowls or fifty
eggs-including some good ones-or a
great five-gallon pot of native beer
apiece

  an astute greek gentleman in addis
abeba does a land-office business in
manufacturing this currency for cara-
vaneers he buys up empty shells and
reprimes them and fills them with a fairly
adventures abyssinian expedition



innocuous mixture of mud and saltpetre
and something that goes off with plenty
of noise-quite often-and he corks them
with a fat lead bullet and there you are

  the business is every bit as illegitimate
as liquor in the united states so every-
body knows where to get them and no-
body ever complains about the quality of
the product any more than a gentleman
would complain to his bootlegger more-
over these cartridges are not expected to
be used but to be carried about maybe
for years as money nor can cartridges
as the clever manufacturer explains be
expected to improve with age

  so there is never any comeback and
anyway they are quite as good as the
eggs that one buys with them

  the hunter of lake abiata then for
two cartridges agreed to take us out along
the lake shore where this big hippo would
feed and as soon as it began to get dark
take us out he did and he enjoined the
greatest caution upon us not to stumble
not to let metal clink upon metal above
all not to whisper for the hearing of
hippos was very acute and that of this
beast particularly so and his temper
in proportion one sound of us one sniff
down wind and he would charge with
great mouth agape as wide as a crocodiles

  with all this precaution it was quite
dark by the time we began to reach the
lake shore the moon would not be up
for an hour yet and the dark was the
clammy mist of wide water spaces we
stumbled along with a clatter that was
appalling in the stillness boots squeaked
like scurrying rats cord riding-breeches
rasped leg against leg rifle slings rattled
as if they were chains with each new
noise we held our breaths and tingled
expecting any moment to hear a roar and
to feel rather than see a huge bulk
hurtling toward us

  yet we survived till presently sure
enough directly in the path where the
cunning old hunter was leading us three
dim shapes loomed ahead by bending
low we could discern them against the
black gray of the skyline one of them
must be our big bull we halted to re-

gain our breaths and lips to ear arranged
how we would shoot we stalked by
inches now twenty feet close we must
get at the very least for rifle sights were
not to be thought about we would have
to shoot by the feel of the general di-
rection

  forty feet thirty feet twenty
the beasts remained amazingly unsuspi-
cious almost tame five more feet

  then one of them lifted his head and
whinnied the other two lifted theirs
tossed their manes and the three of them
trotted off with a clatter of hoofs on the
hard ground immediately whole flocks
of a pestiferous plover kind of bird that is
the bane of the african hunter rose and
screamed all round us till the night was
full of the jeering of imps of the nether
dark

  the effect upon the keen and crafty
old native hunter was something beyond
a white mans comprehension he stated
with the calmness of conviction that the
birds were a sign he could tell from the
way they screamed that the hippos were
out feeding on the reed flats which we
knew existed half a mile to our left where
the bulbullu ran into the lake

  we were not nearly so convinced
but since we had come so far we might
as well take the chance and hope for luck
for it was a likely enough spot so
thither we stumbled and schooled our-
selves to the patience of stalking the
last hundred yards and reached the river
unscathed there we crouched in painful
alertness with straining eyes and ears
while some diabolic night-bird piped a
piercing note of fretful inquietude

  till the souls of dead devils reincar-
nated in mosquito form drove us thence
in a frenzy of impotence we cursed
them and the place and the armor-
plated hunter and ran from there as fast
as the night and the dead stumps and
the thorn patches would allow

  and then we heard our hippo deep and
low out of the after dark laughing at us

  ho-ho-ho-ho ee-eeech ho-ho

  sathanas himself deriding us out of the
pit

 awaieopined the hunter wisely
it is the anu of this water who speaks
with gumares voice

the anu of that water seemed in all
truth to be a powerful spirit and
well disposed to hippos for during all our
stay at that lake never a hippo showed his
nose above water not even the far
floating speck of nostril and ears that of-
fers the most difficult shot in the world
over heat-shimmery water though we
scoured the lake surface with an eight-
power zeiss glass we saw nothing not
even once

  we fretted and cursed the unreliability
of native rumor we called ourselves
fools for having come so far on an unsub-
stantiated story crafty and suspicious
though an old bull hippo might be he
would have to come up to breathe
sometime somewhere and surely there
must be more than one hippo in the world
if water were favorable for the support
of one surely there must be others why
could we see nothing

  then came the excited yarn that our
hippo had eaten up a horse this was
intriguing even a carnivorous outbreak
might be expected of a hippopotamus
that lived under the special protection of
a strong water-spirit but that was only
the first telling of it the story showed
an immediate tendency to grow according
to all the rules of african tradition add-
ing several feet to the size of the animal
and a couple of native boys to the catas-
trophe but with time and more than
human patience careful inquiry and sift-
ing out of much shouting and chatter
elicited a fairly coherent story it
seemed that farther still to the south
another river flowed into this abiata
from yet another lake known as the hora-
uitu the brackish water that in the
hora-uitu where white men never went
hippos lived in vast herds and that our
private hippo the one we had come to
shoot had fled up this other river to join
the herds there

  how did they know because a pair
of frightened boys who had been watering

their horses in the river and swimming
with them had run screaming home to
their village and had reported that as the
horses stood belly-deep in the water a
huge bull hippo had come surging up the
river and had frightfully mauled an un-
fortunate horse that stood in its way and
the horse was surely going to die this
version remained fairly constant through
cross-questioning so that it seemed that
something more or less like the story had
really happened

  we having set forth from afar to slay
were beginning to be gripped by the
mighty hunter complex only blood
can appease that complex-blood with
its sequence of fiction about the length
of the chase and of the size and the cun-
ning and the ferocity of the ultimate
victim

  let me lay stress upon that word
beginning only the preliminary stages
of the complex dominated us blood we
demanded but we had not entered
even upon the common fisherman stage
of self-illusion splendid though it would
have been and soothing to our sense of
vanity we couldnt fool ourselves-the
most authentic-sounding native stories
notwithstanding-that this fabled mon-
ster was all one and the same hippo that
we were tracking down with relentless
determination

  my own conviction is that natives-
that is to say the more or less savage
dwellers of the bush and the jungle
whether they be african or asian or
south american-know infinitely less
about the beasts that surround them than
does the ordinarily observant white
man their knowledge about the ways
of animals is superstition and legend
rather than fact and their information
about the whereabouts of game is always
unreliable

  only here and there a professional
hunter can be met with who knows the
beasts he hunts and a good one knows
his beast personally by individual mark-
ing and name though at that i have
had an expert indian shikari tell me with
utmost conviction of the dealings of
adventures abyssinian expedition



 sundry tigers with the local pot-bellied
 godlings and jungle imps

    in this matter of our hippo we had a
 naively simple native hunter who knew
 very little more than the slightly more
 simple village folk who knew nothing at
 all these tall spearmen were in many
 ways like the zulus a cattle-raising folk
 more interested in their long-standing
 war with their neighbors of the hills the
 gouragis and in their intertribal cow-
 rustling than in big game that on account
 of their few old rifles and mud cartridges
 they could regard as meat only in the
 luckiest circumstances

   i believe that rather than the one
 hippo leaving its mark all across country
 by its ferocity all the older bulls in this
 region were savage on account of having
 been stung every now and then by a
 heavy slug from the rickety old rifle of
 some hopeful taker of long chances
 i believe too that my theory is borne out
 by the extraordinary shyness of all game
 throughout that galla country

   the general impression of hippos is
 that they are great stupid beasts so
 clumsy and helpless that it is hardly
  sportsmanlike to shoot them but that
 impression quite certainly did not fit
 the beasts in this district we had been
 out more than a week in their actual
 habitat and we had not even seen one
 though tracks left in the mud overnight
 showed that they had been out and well
 inland-to inspect our camp the
 hunter said to see what kind of men
 we were who came to hunt his opinion
 seemed to be too that they didnt think
 so very much of our potentialities for
 otherwise they would have charged and
 stamped us flat

   however single monster of ferocity
 or several the complex was upon us and
 blood must be shed so we decided to
 break camp and go on another days
 trek to this hora-uitu lake to-we wished
 we might delude ourselves-to run down
 our quarry

    but that was a hunt to be postponed
 hunting other than for sport or blood
 vengeance was more urgent-meat and

in large quantities the end of the abys-
sinian easter was upon us and it is a fact
difficult of credence that nagadis close
though they are to the beasts that perish
maintain a rigorous fast during the whole
of what corresponds to our lent they
will eat only bread anjera-a sort of un-
leavened sourdough-and shimbura horse
grain during that whole month and
they will travel on this fare

  but when the month of fast is over-
wow it is once again fact difficult of
credence that one nagadi or boy will settle
himself back and consume half a sheep in
that twenty-four hours of holiday and
feasting it is also immemorial custom
that on that day the master abyssinian
or foreigner must declare a holiday and
provide meat to make it a worthy one
and if humanly possible to provide
butter

  the latter was easy the gallas live
almost entirely upon curdled milk and
butter with that anjera stuff this would
sound like quite luxurious larder possi-
bilities but let it be considered how
finicky we are in america about our
dairy products gallas have their own
prejudices and are just as sot about
them

  to begin with a cow must be milked
into a gourd purified by smoke wood
smoke will do-if one happens to be burn-
ing wood but since wood to beburned
must first be chopped up and since cattle
chips are plentiful and require no labor
wood fires are not frequent and we all
know even in the most effetely sanitary
modern apartment what a fiendish
affinity milk has for absorbing each
separate delicate flavor out of a super-
clean porcelain ice-box

  it might be supposed that a really en-
ergetic camvaneer one who has not
yet passed the limit of human exasper-
ation and sunk into the hopless laissez
faire of african trekking might strike
upon the happy thought of sitting around
until some galla decided to milk his cow
and might then produce a nice aluminum
pot and some backshish and thus acquire
milk


gordon maccreagh

  there have been such caravaneers
foolish impatient americans who have
thought to change primitive custom with
common sense and the power of gold
they have lost their illusions and have
become embittered cynics

  under no circumstances will a galla
herdsman milk his cow into a frangi
pot nor into any pot other than a gourd
that has been properly purified other-
wise his cow will die it will cease to
give milk and will shrivel up and die

  they know it because their wise men
have told them that this is so and
when the impatient american has given
up trying to drink milk and has in the
course of time simmered down his exas-
peration he recognizes that the wise men
are very wise indeed for in just such
manner did moses lay down his hygienic
law to his people

  this acrid smoke cure then quite
probably has the effect of slaying the
lesser bacteria which would otherwise
infest a milk gourd that is just wiped out
rather than washed because water is
scarce but it doesnt prevent butter
made of this purified milk from turning
rancid when stored in a large earthen
pot with a leaf over the top for a hermetic
seal

  gallas however like rancid smoked-
cured butter they like it so well that
they rub their bodies over with it as well
as eat it in lumps one stalwart youth
appeared in our camp with the stuff
plastered over his hair in thick gobs and
beginning to melt and trickle down his
shoulders and limbs the explanation of
this formality was 

  oh he wants to get married so he
has just killed his man back in the hills
there and he has come to show off and to
get a present

  so he got two mud cartridges and felt
that it was well worth while to kill a
man i had it translated loudly that i
would pay a dollars worth of cartridges
to any brave youth who would kill me
one of our nagadis but they thought i
was only joking

  upon an easter holiday however past

offenses must be forgiven nagadis as
well as camp boys must be fed both like
butter whether they can purloin it from
masters table or scoop it out a galla pot
five more mud cartridges procured a
smoked-blackened pot containing about
two gallons of this sour mess but meat
was the question

  the local hunter assured us that harte-
beeste and grants gazelle roamed in vast
herds thick as cattle and just over
there-just beyond that belt of thorn
bush so we saddled up jim and i and
took two extra pack-mules for all the meat
and rode just beyond that belt- and
continued riding for four hours before
we saw the first sign of any beast other
than cattle or goat

  it was an hour more after that that we
suddenly flushed a pair of gazelles a fe-
male and a young one not fifty yards
from us in fairly thick bush but they
saw us first and were up and off in a
flash going with the speed of those beasts
that have only speed to rely upon for
their protection from leopards and hunt-
ing-dogs and with that extraordinary
stiff-legged bounding gait that distin-
guishes grants

  let some other mighty hunter who has
the complex badly tell how he can snap
up his rifle and shoot grants gazelle
appearing and disappearing in red-brown
streaks through patches of bush i
didnt even try but jim said wisely

  look theyre circling theyll lead
us to the herd

  so we followed on foot and sure
enough they did-in time there was a
herd of about twenty feeding quietly and
traveling nicely up wind grants are
notoriously shy and difficult to shoot
but we made a stalk for which i take un-
blushing credit up to a hundred and fifty
yards with a clear view we picked our
animals and fired i heard jims voice
say-

  mine fell

  and i was so certain that i had a clear
and steady bead that i didnt attempt
another rear-end shot i watched to see
my buck fall too-and watched and
adventures abyssinian expedition



watched and had not even the satisfac-
tion of seeing it lag behind the rest and
i had been talking to jim about putting
a dollar on the shot

  but jim was magnanimous all that
he said was

  one isnt nearly enough for that
hungry gang well probably get an-
other chance this is good country and
there must be more

  so i gave up looking for blood tracks
and we spread out a little and tramped
for another hour through thorn bush
a couple of hartebeeste saw us in good
time and in a patch of moisture some-
thing with long ears that might have been
a reed buck and then we saw grants
again i was closer and i did not have
the decency to let jim come up with me
for he was one buck ahead i started on
my stalk

  two hundred yards this time before
they began to be uneasy and move off
so i found a quick rest over a low limb
picked my beast and pressed evenly and
surely on the trigger my victim de-
parted as fast as any of them but an-
other buck a good six feet away from it
jumped high in the air as if something had
at least startled it jim far behind me
said no word but started running in a
diagonal direction toward the place
where the herd would probably circle and
i was still looking for blood spoor when
i heard his distant shot

  i hoped with all my heart that he had
missed but presently i heard his
oo-oo-eeh-jim is an ex-australian-
and then i hoped it would be a measly
female

  but it wasnt it was a fine buck with
a pair of horns a good match for the first
jim was still magnanimous he said
its that damn patent peep-sight of
yours i wouldnt have one of those damn
things on any gun for a present give
me a good old square open-sight

  it was in vain that i explained to him
the lore of the modern peep-sight-that
through a peep one did not have to look
for ones game over a black bar of iron
and then center it and at that have half

of it concealed by the bar that one saw
the whole of ones target through a thin
circle whose proximity to the eye made a
semi-transparent blur of it that the or-
thoptic properties of the peep eliminated
fifty per cent of sun glare that the
human eye naturally and without effort
sought the center of the blurred circle
and that all one then had to do was to
bring the front sight to bear on the de-
sired point-as easy as aiming a shot-
gun

  but jim would have none of it an
open sight for him and results were the
best arguments we wrangled over it
all the way back to camp but what
arguments could i produce against two
bucks

  it was not till evening when i was
cleaning my rifle and debating upon
whether to throw it into the lake or to
make a more useful implement out of it-
a kitchen poker-that i discovered one
more of the bright little ways of the
african boy

  this lyman  sight has in addition
to the elevation adjustment a wind-
gauge adjustment reading to minutes of
angle one full revolution of the wind-
gauge screw to one point as on the
standard military rifle and one quarter
revolution marked by a click against
a spring tension adjusts to one minute
of angle the system adopted by all
modern expert riflemen-and by some
mighty hunters one minute of angle
subtends one inch at a hundred yards
two inches at two hundred yards and so
on there are ten points on the scale
to either side of center that is to say
forty minutes or reduced down to point
of impact at two hundred yards eighty
inches

  well one of the gun boys at some time
between the careful sighting in of the
rifle and this first actual shooting with it
had noticed this nice little gadget on it
this pleasing screw that he could twiddle
as he walked along accordingly with
monkey perseverance he had twiddled un-
til it went no farther and then his mind
had wandered off to a contemplation of


gordon maccreagh

nuts or juicy grubs or something and so
he had left it

  so that when i fired over a steady rest
at my buck at two hundred yards
range my bullet went more than six feet
to the left of the heart of that buck

  i could never find out which bright
boy had done it so i have not his tanned
skin as a trophy but that instituted my
rule number one of trekking even as the
law of the medes and persians

  always carry your rifle yourself
no matter how hot it may be or how
heavy the rifle grows with each extra
hour always carry it yourself a gun-
boy anyway as has been witnessed by a
thousand african hunters is always some-
where else when you need him to the very
urgency of life

  and since then i have always carried
my rifle over my shoulder with a sling-
in spite of the fact that slings always rat-
tle when game is wariest and i have
grown a callous on my left shoulder
thereby but i have my gun when i
want it

  all thesame i still wonder why i
couldnt have been lucky enough to hit
that other buck that jumped so high at
two hundred yards

to the bitter-water hora-uitu the
chase went the long stern chase
after the beast that we would have liked
to believe was fleeing before our determi-
nation that we almost did believe in
fact for there was just enough plausi-
bility attached to the native assurances
to make it quite possible

  the trail presently struck the river
and followed it and right there as the
native guide pointed out were horses
bathing belly-deep in the stream to prove
the story probably the same group in
the same place we suggested to the
native and he assured us yes

  it was a good trail wide spaces of
good grazing land with the abyssinian
minimum of thorn bush-which means
scrub-trees not closer than thirty feet
logether and another kind of tree at
last a thing of green leaves and a green

fruit like an olive in shape and like hydro-
chloric acid in taste but the natives
eat them so do monkeys and birds

  what swarms of birds i had heard
that abyssinia was an ornithologists
paradise but i had never understood that
every bird was a new variety as well as a
little darting rainbow of its own steeped
in wonder and admiration of the abys-
sinian birds i have regretted that i am
not an ornithologist all the coloring
that one has been accustomed to associ-
ating with parrots and humming birds
one sees in these birds

  i wept that i was as stupid as all the
rest of us and could place only hawks and
eagles and things and orioles-at all
events birds that wove their nests and
hung them upside down there must
have been a dozen different kinds of
weavers each with its different shape of
nest some as straggly and untidy as
sparrows and some as neat as kinder-
gartens

  and it was irresistibly noticeable that
the neat ones belonged to correspondingly
decorous builders beautiful virtuous crea-
tures that hung upside down in their
doorways and chirruped to their innocu-
ous mates who sat above while the
untidy nests belong to others as painted
and fussy and loud and chattering as a
chorus of the folies bergeres

  but this pretty dicky-bird dissertation
is out of place we are mighty hunters
thirsting to shed blood the hora-uitu
turned out to be a magnificient piece of
water with shelving shores free for four
and five miles at a stretch of that terrible
papyrus swamp that is such a hopeless
bar against all approach

  and on the shelving shore close to the
outflow of the river which was our hippos
highway were great round three-toed
tracks-many of them some small enough
to be mistaken for overtrodden cattle
spoor some as big as dessert plates and
one fresh last night a monster trail
that would have done credit to a sizable
elephant

  here were hippos at last it seemed as
if this far lake was their sanctuary here
adventures abyssinian expedition



surely would be our chance we made
camp a good mile from that place so that
no unseemly noises might disturb the
wary beasts we fired no shots at ma-
rauding vultures or at the jackals that
began to slink around with sundown
and then with the dusk we took our rifles
and two camp chairs and crept down to
the beach it would be possibly a long
wait but some time during that night
the beasts would come out to feed and
then if we waited and did not lose our
heads and remained very still that mon-
ster bull would surely come too

   a stiff breeze sprung up with the dark
quartering across the lake toward us
that was good-we permitted ourselves
a whispered congratulation-for keen
as was their sense of smell they wouldnt
get our scent but the mosquitoes would
-and did

  gods of the chase what droves of
mosquitoes we sat on sandy lake shore
but from the wet grass fringe behind us
they rose in their waves-merciless emis-
saries of those jealous red gods to test
our fortitude and we set our teeth and
stuck it out took it sitting still we
dared not squirm or twist or slap for we
heard them moving out there in the
dark our hippos moving cautiously in-
shore

  one grunted somewhere with the ven-
triloquistic effect of sound close to the
waters surface another one answered
quiet splashes indicated that bulky
bodies were heaving themselves up into
the shallows

  and then one laughed the deep
bass satanic ho-ho-ho-ee-eecli-ho-ho that
we had heard once before we wondered
why then a long silence then splash-
ing away to our right the splashing
grew in volume and continued we let
ourselves out and swore

  for to the right where the splashing
was was the side from which the wind
blew off shore toward the water and was
moreover on the other side of the river
and there the splashing stayed

  i have never understood this maneuver
of hippos nor have i ever seen it men-

tioned by any writer on big game wo
could see nothing across there for the sky
was overcast and the moon was a late and
a thin one but we could hear plainly
enough that many beasts were in shallow
water about knee depth i should say
and that they apparently just stood and
shuffled about they were not walking
in the shallows for the noise remained in
one place nor were they feeding there
in a group for later investigation showed
that to be a clean sand bottom bare of
reeds or lily roots or anything edible

   there was plenty of fodder farther in-
shore-grass and equicetum reed-but
that was all well out of the water this
splashing in the one place continued for
about two hours and then gradually re-
ceded along the shore away from us

  then we went back to camp and be-
lieved everything we had heard about
anu spooks

   we soothed our mosquito lacerations-
they were more than bites-and told
each other grimly that there would be
another night tomorrow

   we had a boat a novel invention called
an airaft which in fact it was-a vast
automobile tire built oblong and with a
bottom sewn in one blew it up with a
pump and presto there was a shallow-
draft bone-dry boat easy to row or
paddle and capable of carrying two men
and a pile of baggage the whole thing
deflated in its canvas bag measured
about fourteen inches by ten by six and
weighed about eleven pounds-quite the
most efficient thing of its kind i have ever
seen

   we grinned as we inflated this boat the
next evening and quietly paddled across
the river if those an -protected hippos
preferred that shore for their dance we
would be waiting for them we were
prepared to find that the potent gauro-
dian spirits would see to it that the
night would be dark again and we took
along modern white mans inventions
that these anus would not know about

   jim had one of those justrite hunt-
ers lamps a carbide-burner that was
attached to the peak of a cap somet hing


gordon maccreagh

like a miners light and ignited by a
spark from a flint and little wheel like a
cigar-lighter no matches to fumble with
there silence and sudden would be the
shaft of bright white light i to be pre-
pared in the event of separation lashed
a flashlight to the forearm of my rifle
where i could press my thumb on the
button with rifle held to shoulder and
could see my front sight to perfection
we tested both our cunning devices and
grinned at each other again

  this night there was no wind good
again anything rather than an offshore
wind though that made no difference to
the mosquitoes once again we paid the
price that the red gods demanded and
we wondered as we thought of malaria
that the white mans craft had not yet
devised some bug-deterrent of less pun-
gent and all-pervading odor than oil of
pennyroyal or citronella

 our reward came-in the course of
time let it be remembered that we
had to take up our positions behind bush-
es before dark and remain there without
moving till the wily beasts should decide
to come ashore but they came along at
last gruntings and vast breathings and
low calls sounded from the lake ques-
tions to one another and doubtful as-
surances that everything seemed to be
all right then faint splashings it was
amazing how silent such great beasts
could be

  this night they didnt dance in the
shallows we had hoped they would
with that noise going on we might have
walked out and come who knows how
close this time they came out to feed
softly one by one they heaved out of
the deeps and came ashore by bending
low we could just distinguish dim bulks
against the faint sheen of the water and
then the blackness of the shore blotted
them out again

  presently we could hear squelchings in
the soft mud behind us and scrunchings
as of mowing-machines  they were all
around us somewhere in the dark i re-
membered all the stories i had read of the
potential savagery of these beasts when

trapped at a disadvantage on shore all
the authentic accounts of their attacks
upon boats and occasionally upon keepers
in zoos all the tales that the gallas had
told of the ferocity of these particular
brutes and their patent fear of them
born of experience and i felt a tingling
up and down my spine and then jim
helped to cheer the occasion by pressing
his lips to my ear and breathing-

  my gosh if one of them gets scared
and starts for the water hell run right
over us like a steamroller

  we decided mutually and without tell-
ing each other that it would be better to
move out nearer to the water where the
open sand strip would leave room to
dodge we crept out one foot feeling the
way for the next a splash directly ahead
arrested us we froze straining our
eyes we made out a shadow looming in
front a thickening of the blackness
against the less black water an immen-
sity doubled in size by the hanging night-
mist and not thirty feet away

  i heard the faint drip of water as jim
turned it on into the carbide in a sec-
ond i caught the odor of the gas scrape
went the spark wheel and scrape again
the black immensity snorted

  what the hell i heard jims in-
furiated mutter

  scrape once more

  scrape-scrape-scr-r-rape damn not
a light

  and here i hesitated to record the
blank truth for it is not reasonably
credible we had tested that light in the
afternoon it had worked perfectly
we had cleaned it and put in a new load
and now at this last critical moment it
refused to function the thing taken
alone is on the verge of excusable dis-
belief but rank impossibility must be
piled upon the incredible i raised my
rifle and pressed the button of my flash-
light blackness not a glimmer not
aglow darkness as dead as topheth

  and there the bulk snorted in front of
us

  hell i shouted shoot blind

  and we did both together by the feel
of our guns at our shoulders

  who knows whether we hit anything
probably we didnt and even if we did
we carried no elephant guns that might
hit heavy game almost anywhere and
stop it all i know is that the brute be-
fore us snorted once and then was gone
in a surge of splashing like a locomotive
through a washout

  in another second the soggy ground
quaked all about us as at the snorting
rush of steamrollers plunging down grade
to the deeps and we so far from dodg-
ing we stood frozen and quaked with the
ground

  the hurtling splashing was a roar of
waters it receded its waves came back
and lapped up and down the beach they
died away the black lake surface be-
came silent and then from out of the
black silence-

   iio-ho-ho-ee-eech ho-ho-ho-ho

  and further out again-
  ee-eech-hoh-hoh-hohl

  and that is the plain unbelievable
truth exactly as it happened

  no it was not just ill luck it was not
the cussedness of inanimate objects it
was not the dampness of night moisture
collecting upon batteries or upon metal
hot from the days sun

  it was the anu spirits of that galla
lake

  i am convinced that anu spooks are
live malignant existences if we had
stayed there any longer im sure i could
have surprized one some day and photo-
graphed it

  but we didnt stay the chance of
shooting a hippo there after that fiasco
was minus nil to the nth power and the
gallas who knew about all these things
came and told us that all those hippos
and particularly our savage bull would
forthwith make a long night trek twenty
miles overland back to the first lake to
zwai of the papyrus swamps where a
european hunter of addis abeba had
told us no hippo were

  so we broke laager and trekked too

disgusted enough and pig-headed enough
  

to hunt for a way over a mountain where
the gallas said there was no way

but that lake must go down in the
record as forgiven on account of its
birds i cant leave it without some small
comment on the birds waders and shore
runners there were by the battalion and
fleet anywhere else they would have
been interesting enough in their own little
comings and goings but here they were
small stuff here amateur attention was
arrested by black and white ibises pink
flamingos and great white pelicans and
particularly by a splendid fish-eagle that
perched all day with aimless patience on
a low dead tree and screamed an an-
guished wah-hiu-hiu to a mate that never
came

  but pelicans in their manifold ma-
neuvers were the daily wonder the im-
mediate most noticeable thing about
pelicans is that while so flat and splay-
footed and clumsy on land the moment
they take to the water they become grace-
ful white yachts maneuvering for a good
start should a human come too close and
on the wing they are smooth-gliding
planes of power and elegance close over
the surface of the water they will often
fly a long fine of them-each one in the
exact wake of the other and each with the
same machine-like regularity of wing-
beat three strong unhurried sweeps
and a long glide five and a longer glide
each wing-tip on the down stroke just
skimming the water and leaving a thin
ripple behind when that happens
against the evening sun as the birds go
home to roost one gasps with the delight
of it and weeps that cameras are after
all such inadequate monotonic machines

  here let somebody rise and tell me
about the newest f  lenses and erma-
nox cameras and iso-chromo extra-rapid
plates with color filters but let him try
to catch white birds and pearl gray water
and black-green reed reflections against a
pink sunset

  an apparent playtime of pelicans seems
to be late afternoon when they fly high
and circle like questing vultures and


gordox maccreagh

then they have a trick of disappearing
completely for minutes at a time and sud-
denly reappearing again-some queer
effect of the low-lying light and shadow
but ive given up trying to explain it to
myself strong glasses can pick them
out pale gray against a blue-gray sky
butto the naked eye they remain invisible
till they wheel and appear suddenly like
a squadron of white aeroplanes at five
thousand feet banking steeply to descend
in wide spirals then zooming up again
on a strong wind perhaps some scientifico
knows why

  a flock of pelicans fishing is an example
of cooperative labor that the natives
could do worse than copy let these wise
birds catch a school of small fry any-
where near the shore and they will collect
like a herring fleet and quickly organize
a drive in a half circle beating the
water with their wings they will bedevil
their prey and drive them systematically
into the shallows

  and then admiration of the pelican
is lost in amazement at his greed and
capacity with hoarse croakings and un-
dignified scufflings the birds literally fall
upon their meal and engulf it in huge
shovelfuls i hope i dont exaggerate
when i say that a big pelicans bill-
pouch working like a bucket-dredge will
scoop up four or five pounds of small fish
follows a craning of the bill an agonized
straining of the rubbery neck with eyes
squeezed tight over the effort and the
whole mass is gone and the bird is ready
to climb over the backs of its neighbors
who have gotten ahead of it during the
brief moment of stress and to fall over
their heads into the swirling mess for an-
other scoopful one should not watch
pelicans feed

  pink and white flamingos supply the
humor of the water front with their
long stiff legs and their necks stretched
with head immersed to snuffle for fresh-
water clams or algae or whatever it is that
they grub out of the mud shallows they
look like drunken tripods gone to sleep
i dont know whether anybody has ever
had the patience to watch and find out

for how long a flamingo can keep its head
upside down under water

  catching them in this position the
resurgent boy in a sober explorer is irre-
sistibly impelled to creep up behind and
throw stones at them and then to fall
back and scream with laughter at the
look of injured wonder with which they
withdraw their heads from the mud and
twist their boneless necks round over
their backs to see what this indecent
disturbance is about

  half a million pink flamingos flying low
against a late amber sky are also a
wonder and a delight to be remembered

  ibises what can one say about ibises
except that they are black as night and
white as daylight and are always grace-
ful and unhurried and dignified watch-
ing them one understands that egyptians
held them sacred

  it was regretfully that we left this good
lake and climbed the sides of a low moun-
tain so thickly strewn with volcanic
tufa and a sort of black razor-edged
obsidian that mules had to pick their way
and the boys with their naked feet were
in sore trouble it was as we mounted
slowly and the view spread out beneath
us that we began to form a conception
of what a splendid lake this hora-uitu
really was

  monotony of the long climb was avoid-
ed by keeping on expecting to find just
over the next ridge one of the impassable
clefts or ravines that the people of the
hidden village assured us prevented
further progress

  it was a curious frightened sort of vil-
lage surrounded by an unusually thick
and high thorn fence and nestling at the
base of a cliff completely screened by
thorn bush one did not know there was
a village there until one smelled it

  i suppose all african villages smell at
greater or lesser range galla villages are
not so bad when one has once adjusted
ones mind to accept them-or when one
has huddled under a thorn bush at close
quarters to a well greased galla hunter
it is a kind of faint floating garbagy-
smoky-rancid-butterv smell
adventure s abyssinian expedition



  the people of this hidden village jim
thought were either malefactors or runa-
way slaves and for some obscure reason
of their own they surely did not want us
to go over that mountain possibly for
nothing more definite than some vague
idea that where white men once passed
there would presently be a road and their
seclusion would thus be destroyed

  however ridge lifted beyond ridge and
valley led into glen and never a cleft did
we see that called for a detour of more
than a couple of hundred yards good
going it was rather magnificent going
in fact after thorn scrub here was fine
upland grass and shade trees in con-
siderable variety more grazing to the
half square mile than in a days trek over
the flat

  but-no water here in the hills were
no hollows where even rainwater could
collect how deep must tree tap-roots
go i wonder where the rain comes in
spells of six months apart and what do
kudu and the various mountain buck and
rock baboons drink when there are too
many of them to lick the moisture that
sometimes condenses on the shady under
side of a rock

  yet that afternoon as if in answer to
the question it rained for the first time in
six months sudden black clouds built
themselves out of the white cumulous
vapor that had been making such a suc-
cession of pictures against the ultra-
marine sky for the past weeks a cold
wind howled over the peaks from no-
where and then rain in a whirl of
fury heavy stinging rain as if to
drown in spitefulness all the herbage that
had waited for it so long

  nagadis with pack mules of course
were strung out anywhere over the last
mile or so raincoats of course were in
the packs-anywhere where the boys to
whom they had been handed with strict
orders to carry them had stuffed them
and as monkeys when startled lose what
little minds they have and chatter in
helpless fright so camp boys when faced
with the masters just wrath chatter and
are enveloped in simian forgetfulness

  i do not know how many of the packs
had to be unloaded before the raincoats
were found it doesnt matter suffice it
that everything including the contents
of the opened packs was very properly
wet first and yet the law of abyssinia
does not permit one to use boys skin as
impromptu rain-shelters

  that was the beginning of the little
rains from now on rain might be ex-
pected any day for the next few days and
every day for the next few weeks or so
then there would be a lull of another
two or three weeks and then-rain
the big rains four months of them
and from all accounts the word big is
miserably inadequate

  rain there were rivers to be crossed
before we should see the great metropolis
again and dry ravines which would
presently be thirty-foot-deep rapids it
behooved us to hurry

along long day over that mountain
and a short one on the level brought
us to the zwai lake again where all our
hippo had trekked overnight but this
time we were twenty miles across on the
opposite shore to where we had first seen
it two exquisite little steep-sided islands
thickly clustered with neat huts hugged
the shore

  there was more population crowded
on to these two little islands than over
two days trek on the open plain and the
reason was startlingly illustrative of the
actual precariousness of life among this
warlike folk islands were much more
secure against sudden attack than were
thorn fences

  lakis these people were so called
after their islands they paddled out on
frail cigar-shaped bundles of papyrus
reeds to inspect this white camp that sud-
denly sprung up on their mainlaad and
they brought untold delicacies roasted
wheat and fish and fowl and native beer
a nice friendly people

  gumare-hippos we asked them
doubtfully

  oh yes they astounded us by re-
plying away out there


gordon maccreagh

  we brought the glasses to bear on the
tiny half-submerged island that lay per-
haps a couple of miles offshore and-
our voices dropped to unconscious cau-
tion-it was true a whole herd of pinky-
browny hippos lying all over each other on
a sand shallow

  yes the gumare came and they went
the islanders told us sometimes they
were there and sometimes they were not
these had just come but they were very
fierce and they attacked boats that went
out at dusk and one old bull in par-
ticular-

  at that we shut them up we had
heard all these local legends about com-
ing and going and about ferocious old
bulls in particular we had been chasing
this particular fairy story over the whole
lake region the only point that in-
terested us was whether these islanders
would for a backshish take us out in their
reed floats close enough to these ferocious
monsters to get a shot at them

  there was all the demur we expected
those gumare were very fierce and it was
true by their fathers spirits that they
would rush at boats and crunch them like
eggshells and that old slate-gray bull-
etc etc ad nauseam

  any discussion with african natives
must be an affair of hours this one
tired out our patience to the point of
murder how long would hippo stand
in broad daylight view while we argued
but nothing would move those lakis
they would not under any circumstances
go out so far from shore to attack gumare
but if we would wait toward late after-
noon just before the dreaded dusk the
gumare would probably begin to move
closer in preparation for going out to feed
at a favored place of old which was now
rich with untrampled grass if we would
wait till that short remnant of daylight
for a backshish of one dollar apiece a
small fleet of them would take us out but
not farther than their own islands

  we - i in particular - fumed and
stamped up and down the beach hip-
pos cautiously swimming inshore would
offer no more than the difficult snapshot

at the thin wedge between nose and ears
as they came up to snort a breath before
sinking again and a snapshot from a
frail unstable reed float at that i tried
to hire a reed raft myself-i could use a
double paddle as well as they did-to buy
one even but an idea so new to the
african mind would require two days and
a consultation of the village elders to
consider

  wait we had to-and i spent all of the
time seeing that my rifle was clean and
oiled and that the sight adjustments were
exactly to the minutest fraction of an
inch where they should be

  a joshua delayed that afternoon but
it did begin to grow late at last and
anxious glasses showed that the pinky-
browny island was slowly disintegrating
bits broke off it and quietly disappeared
it dwindled and presently it was all
gone

  where now were all the brave men who
would man the fleet they were not so
many as had at first talked about it
but the usual epithets of scorn-women
little children-and silver dollars dis-
played aroused a certain response with
much hesitation and much more telling
to each other of the laki equivalent for
let george do it and after weighing
the dollars in their hands to make sure
that they were real and fat ones a small
fleet of six reed rafts prepared to go out

  and it was high time narrow wedges
of slate-gray began to show for seconds at
a time and to disappear with a pfoof under
a spray of vapor they were within the
outer edge of the islands in another
half-hour the dusk would begin to creep
over the water and then nothing would
drive the fleet to sea

  but delay even in africa must come
to an end we nearly exploded with im-
patience but we did get away the big-
gest of the reed boats was barely big
enough to float two men one did not
sit in such a thing of course there was no
concavity to sit in one sat on it rather
semi-submerged in the water and kept
ones balance by paddling with ones feet

  and then the village humorist from
adventures abyssinian expedition



safe ashore called that sometimes croco-
diles sneaked up under reed rafts and bit
peoples legs off i am prepared to take
oath that i did not spasmodically jerk
my legs out of the crawly wet-proof of
which is that the boat did not immediate-
ly roll over besides i was too intent up-
on watching a great gray wedge that was
intent upon watching us and which did
not seem to be half as nervous about the
boats as the boats were about it

  other smaller wedges showed from
time to time but it was this big dark
gray one that i wanted to come close to
this surely must be the fabled ferocious
bull or any other bull-i didnt care as
long as it was a big one i promised my-
self that i would believe every one of the
stories that the natives would tell about
how that individual gumare had eaten
reed boats whole with full cargoes of
lovely kings daughters

  but come close the fleet would not a
hundred yards away those stout boat-
men remained and would approach no
closer whether the tales about the
ferocity of this beast or of one like it
were true or no there was no doubt
about the islanders fear of it every
time it would snort and blow a spray they
would hurriedly back-paddle every
time it would submerge there would be a
scurry

  it will swim below water and heave
up under a boat they insisted and
then where would we all be

  in the soup remarked jim cheer-
fully

  but it did seem to be true the thing
came distinctly closer eah time it sub-
merged how close to where the boats
had been before they fled it was difficult
to judge but certainly closer

  take a chance mac jim began to
urge me i had the heavier gun take
a shot the next time it lifts its head
and looks its not getting any lighter
and these fellows wont stay out much
longer

  but i swore that id be damned if id
shoot at a smear of gray in the water a
hundred yards away out of a rolling

log that heaved with each dip of the
paddle particularly not since my boat-
man paddled all the time and since most
of the time he kept the boats nose slanted
for a quick turn and run and i had to
twist myself more than half around even
to see the beast what fire one shot and
then trek over the rest of africa to get
another chance

  no i wanted at least a reasonable hope
of getting a sight on that vanishing wedge
at the limit of exasperation i got my
boatman to understand that he was to
cease paddling when that slice of nose and
forehead appeared and that he was to sit
still and not wiggle his toes or blink his
eyes

  and when after a dozen more attempts
the man was beginning to be drilled into
it the beast executed a maneuver that
nearly ruined the whole hunt it had
been watching us and blowing angrily
through its nose for quite a long stretch of
seconds my shoulder and left arm ached
from holding my rifle at the aim and hop-
ing to catch a moment of steadiness
then suddenly the beast gave a snort and
heaved itself half out of the water like
a great gray whale-back it looked and
with a vast splash it dived

  then there was a panic those heavy
water-logged reed rafts might have com-
peted in a canoe race that was the last
sign the men yammered the big brute
was now infuriated and was after us in
earnest had those things been fight
canoes the men would never have stopped
before they beached them high ashore
it was only when muscle and wind gave
out that we were able to make them hear
that no submarine torpedo was on its way
to us there was the pursuing wedge in
sight again on the surface

  whatever might have been the empti-
ness at the pit of my stomach during that
frenzied minute of flight i cant believe
now that the brute had started on so
spectacular an attack i dont attempt to
explain why the great brute suddenly
jumped like that but i give it credit for
more wiliness than that i have heard of
and i can understand a hippos being


gordon maccreagh

infuriated  the point of rushing open-
jawed upon a boat but i feel sure that
if this brute had wanted to dive under
and engulf a boat from beneath it would
surely have quietly sunk and made its
attack from the security of under water

  anyway the thing had not chased us-
at all events not very far for there it
was again snorting and blowing spray
and looking directly towards us but it
was nearer much nearer than those
wary paddle-men had let it come before
perhaps up to seventy-five yards 

  and then suddenly came my chance as
chances do sometimes if one waits long
enough the boat was momentarily
steady the great gray head was slightly
lifted my sights swung into line

  dusk was upon us if i let this chance
go i would surely not get another that
day and would we ever persuade the
men out again after their panic

   i fired

  smack was the instant crack of the
bullet on hard bone the huge head

heaved up the shoulders rose sluggishly
high of the water then rolled over side-
wise and disappeared under

  by golly you got him shouted jim
i saw the splash where you hit fair in
the center of the forehead come on
home to supper hell be floating in
twenty-four hours

  so the long hunt was ended i dont
know how much i ought to believe about
the individuality of this ferocious man-
eating hippo probably nothing pos-
sibly a little native yarns are some-
times amazingly true i do however be-
lieve now in the unusual savageness of the
generality of the hippos of that lake
region

  but i promised myself i would believe
all the stories that the natives would tell
about this particular hippo i must for

i	have made myself another mental
promise-to bring back to each appreci-
ative editor of the adventure staff a cane
made of hippo hide with a hippo ivory
top

france mud a khaki-clad col-
umn of fours slogging along to the
rhythm of their own muttered but
heart-felt blasphemy-a common enough
sight in the winter of -

  but in one particular this procession of
sufferers was unique on the shoulders of
each performer shone bright silver bars
and their more or less manly chests were
spanned by sam browne belts a casual
observer would have taken them for
officers but no on each breast was a pair
of silver wings and their uniforms were of
well-fitting but variously designed whip-
cord the pot-bellied little person in the
indecently short yellow serge blouse who
led them was an officer his followers were
flying lieutenants

  they were a part of the personnel-in-
training of the great american aviation
field of issy-la-boue the advance guard
of the ten thousand american bombing
planes which publicity agents said were
going to blast the huns out of berlin

  the column passed between two long

barracks one of which filled to capacity
with double-decker bunks yawned thru
an unfinished open end

  squads right shrilled the pot-bellied
one with the captains bars in a startling
tremolo heh

  the men behind squads-righted in a
dispirited fashion and came to a halt in
straggling lines the squawky voice
continued

  i want to say that you are the most
undisciplined body of men i ever saw
that-er-melee you staged when you
were unwittingly marched into-er-
contact with a body of enlisted men was
the most disgraceful exhibition on the
part of officers so-called i ever saw in
my life i-er-want to say you are a
disgrace to the service thats all i want
to say oh i-er-believe lieutenant
crosby has something to say to you

perhaps he should hqve said officers
but that wouldnt have sounded right
either he rushed on i want to remind
you that hippys and sams funeral is
this afternoon all flying is called off as
usual there wasnt much of a crowd out
for poor old bill yesterday i know its
a long walk and all that but we want to
get a good crowd out this afternoon
the cadets are going to try to get a good
crowd out for their fellow who got
bumped and we want to get a good crowd
out too thats all i wanted to say

  he retired to the ranks the fat officer
shouted dismissed then he changed
his mind

  as you were the commanding officer
wanted me to announce that quarantine
to the post is on again until the perpetra-
tor of the outrage of stopping the paris
express has been discovered and pun-
ished dismissed

  the half-broken ranks scattered in the
direction of their barracks toward the
one with the unfinished end went three
oddly dissimilar figures they were al-
ways together and of course some one
had already thought of calling them
the three musketeers

  one was short dark and slim with
pathetic eyes and a dispirited mustache
another was tall and lathy with a long
lugubrious countenance the third was
blond and almost corpulent

  i knew it tommy i knew it said the
tall man how come you and fat to
pull such a stunt anyway aint such
a joke now is it whatre you going to
do about it

  the three entered their barrack and sat
down on a bunk near the open end well
away from the crowd huddled around the
stove in the tniddle the little man
gazed sadly before him

  his mustache drooped dolefully some
observant person had remarked that he
could read tommy by his mustache when
it was freshly waxed and pert he was
just going on a party when it was sorry
and unkempt he had just been on one

  you know we didnt mean any harm
he said all that stuff the frogs put out

about our trying to wreck the train was
a dish of prunes as if it wasnt bad
enough to miss the truck and walk out
here twelve miles from town without
having all this on top of it when the
quarantine for the itch was taken off and
fat and i got those thirty-six hours on
condition you dont go to paris passes
we got by the m ps at the gare in paris
all right

  we went out through the baggage-
room i wasnt in the ambulance for
nothing we came back into the station
the same way and once we got on the
train we went right to sleep they sure
do put up a good champagne cocktail at
henrys and then all those beers at the
follies

  well when i woke up we were at a
station i looked out and the sign on it
said chateauroux i knew where we were
all right because ive flown over the place
wed passed issy so i woke fat up and
pulled him off the train there was an-
other train standing in the station and i
asked a frog where it went to and he said
it was the paris express so i knew it
would take us back to issy again and we
hopped on

  we got into a third class compartment
with a lot of poilus and they had beaucoup
red wine and we drank to la belle france
and les-fitats-unis and when i woke up
again the train was just leaving a station
and the sign said issy-la-boue by tfye
time i realized what it all meant we were
going too fast to jump off so i pulled that
handle on the wall and the train stopped

  when we saw how wrought up the
frogs were we beat it no wonder we had
to come over and help them win the war
if theyre all as bum shots as those birds
were guess they thought we were ban-
dits or spies or something well we had
to walk home to keep from being a w o
loose from roll-call this morning and
never got home till four oclock suppose
after flying ill have to go over and fess
up to herman or you birds will never get
any more passes but i know ill never
get one if i stay here for the duration of
the war
the lucky little stiff



  no pass aint nothin to what youll
get boy said long john shot at
sunrise is my bet but i admire your
self-sacrificin spirit

  never mind well take our medicine
wont we fat and if i dont mention
you maybe he wont say anything about
it

  fat grunted dolefully outside a bugle
blew the three rose to go

  its me and tommy to fly the eighteen
meters said long john where do
you go fat

  machine-gun was the answer
hum too bad i heard the guy they
shot there last week croaked the bullet
went right thru his leg and the quack
dressed the place where it went in all
right but forgot to see if it came out
gangrene set in and his leg rotted off
and they had to shoot him now a feller
your build-say it wouldnt go through
at all just stay there and fester-

  but his victim was gone

tommy flew badly that morning
he was all in his head ached and
besides he was worrying about that inter-
view with major herman krause and
then he had to practise landings-nervous
work at best in an unfamiliar ship finally
he blew a tire and was bawled out un-
mercifully by the instructor

  luckily it was on his tenth and last
trip and he breathed a sigh of relief when
the lecture was over and he could go he
went to the barracks and policed up
shave shine but no shampoo there
was hardly enough water for drinking and
shaving and that was brought many
miles in tank wagons bathing was
something one went without at issy-
and felt not much the worse unless the
scabbies set in

  once militarily clean tommy dragged
himself to headquarters entirely ruining
the new shine so painfully acquired he
entered the presence of the adjutant feel-
ing like a whipped schoolboy he saluted
and stood at attention

  sir lieutenant lang to speak to the
commanding officer

  the adjutant kept on writing for about
five minutes at a desk stacked with piles
of reports then he looked up savagely
and spoke with a slight accent

  what oh yes what for

  about the paris express

  go right in hes waiting

  tommy went in and stood with trem-
bling knees before the c o he was a
large florid man with beetling brows and
his manner wras not encouraging

  you well what about it
tommy explained as well as he could
stressing his innocence he thought his
plea must have softened an executioner
but major krause was uncompromising
in attitude and words

  young man he said you are a dis-
grace sir a disgrace to the united
states army tommy thought he had
heard those words before we have
been having considerable trouble with
the guard those cadets are the worst
disciplined body of men i ever saw
again a familiar note

  as for you-you seem to have trouble
keeping awake a permanent assign-
ment as commander of the guard ought to
give you- beneficial practise at it of
course after keeping awake all night you
will need to sleep in the day-time you
are therefore relieved from flying duty
report at guard mount this evening and
every evening until further orders that
will do

  tommy saluted and went out his heart
sinking there were only three known
ways of getting out of issy-la-boue
the first was to break your neck the
second was to fly so well that you were
graduated the third was to fly so
poorly that you were sent to blooey for
reclassification probably as an arma-
ment officer which was generally con-
sidered the lowest form of fife so far dis-
covered in the air service

  all these methods were dependent on
flying once a man was taken off flying
duty it took an act of congress to get
him away from the place

  the little man wended his way back
to the barracks his comrades were


h p s greene

sitting on their bunks and he poured his
tale of woe into their receptive ears
being beyond words they accorded him
silent sympathy finally fat spoke

  well im lucky to be out of it say
did you hear the news brock was
washed out on the fifteens this morning

  that makes seven in a week said
tommy after a pause howd it hap-
pen

  same old thing wings came off

  a bugle called most of the flying lieu-
tenants went outside and joining others
from near-by barracks formed in line
a few commands and they were in one of
the rivers of mud which served as roads
at the field presently they were halted
behind three long two-wheeled pushcarts
cach cart bore a long box covered with an
american flag the mourners stood in
the mud for half an hour waiting and then
a dispirited looking band appeared
its bass drum echoed boom-boom-boom-
boom-boom and the procession started

  through the gate of the camp it went
and out on to the main road while the
drum kept up its sad hollow sound
yard after yard rod after rod until the
cortege had walked two miles then it
turned into a young but flourishing ceme-
tery with red raw mounds in orderly lines

 the men were formed around three
fresh graves a pale-faced y m c a
man stumbled through the burial service
a red-faced knight of columbus did like-
wise a frenchman flew over and
dropped some dessicated roses then
they all marched away again only the
boxes and a small burial party remained
behind

  the band struggled with its one tune a
lively quickstep according to regulations
two old peasants drew their cart to one
side of the road to let them pass

  comme ils sont trists les tits ameri-
cains said the woman

  quelle musique answered her spouse

the three chums went back to
their bunks

  do you birds know anything about
being the commander of the guard

asked tommy with some concern
 no replied fat

  sure answered long john i was
chucked out of the first training camp
first you have to have a gun

  a rifle asked tommy

  no you little sap officers dont
carry rifles or flying lieutenants either
a pistol

  but i aint got a pistol

  borrow one then do you know the
general orders

  i dont know any generals orders or
debility either

  never mind trying to be funny you
may find out it aint no joke about gen-
erals the old boy himself and the
silly civilian are going to inspect the
post tomorrow i saw the orders over
at the operations office for every machine
to be up that can get off the ground i
suppose that means a lot more long walks
but its most time for guard mount
youd better run along and find a gun
tommy disappeared and finally re-
turned with a regulation web belt and
holster in one hand and a  caliber auto-
matic in the other

  what are you going to do with that
popgun you idiot asked long john
disgustedly are you going hunting
canary birds or what

  i couldnt find a regular gun and a
cadet loaned me this he said officers
had taken it before and put a dirty sock
or something in the holster so the butt
would just show and got by all right
very well then take one of fats
socks the smell may keep you awake
is the blamed thing loaded look out
you dont shoot yourself theres the
call now put on your belt you fool
how many belts are you going to wear
what do you think you are a past grand
master of the holy jumpers take off
your sam browne there-get going
now

  well away he goes and he doesnt
know whether julius caesar was stabbed
or shot off horseback did you ever see
the like fat but i bet he comes out all
right some way the lucky little stiff i
the lucky little stiff



never knew it to fail well lets go up by
the stove

  but tommy wasnt such a complete fool
as he appeared he knew the old army
advice for shavetails find a good ser-
geant and stick to him the sergeant of
the guard was a grizzled old sufferer who
had been through it all many many
times he engineered the guard mount
and posted the guard then tommy
drew him to one side

 what do i do now sergeant he
asked

  well the lieutenant has to inspect the
guard three times once between midnight
and six oclock in the morning first
ask them for their special orders and then
for their general orders if they make a
mistake ill nudge you and you say
correct him sergeant and ill fix him
up its getting dark now would the
lieutenant like to make his first inspec-
tion before supper

  inspection was a hectic affair the
guard was composed of cadets who had
joined the army to fly and remained in it
to mount guard and it was their intention
to make it as interesting as possible for
all concerned especially their superiors
but the old sergeant was equal to the oc-
casion he steered tommy by the traps
planted for him and then showed him the
guardhouse

  there the commander of the guard ate
his slum and then returned to his bar-
rack long john grabbed him by the
arm as he entered

  that frog was around again today
and he brought a lot of stuff he whis-
pered youre in on it doc is goin to
make punch be around at nine oclock

tommy was there at the appointed
time at the far end a crowd was
gathered men were perched as closely
as possible on the double-deck bunks
in their midst bacchanalian rites were in
progress doc a stout man with a red
satyr-like countenance was beating a
huge bowl of eggs before him within
easy reach and frequently applied was
an assorted row of bottles tommy read

some of the labels-cherry brandy
martell d o m absinthe

  my god he muttered to himself
everything but nitroglycerine

  the party was undoubtedly a success
there were songs and dances and stories
finally it got to the speechmaking stage
an interruption in the form of a volley of
shots was welcome to every one except
the current performer a trampling of
feet and then more shots followed a
voice at the other end of the barrack
shouted attention as major krause
stumbled in he had evidently been run-
ning but he tried to stalk around in a
dignified manner somebody whispered-
those damn cadets have been shoot-
ing off their guns and raising hell again
and hes been trying to catch them

  the major approached the end of the
barrack where the party had been in
progress he sniffed suspiciously but the
punch-bowl had been shoved under a bunk
and the bottles into -boots and there was
no evidence in sight finally he asked-
are there any guns in this barrack
no tommy spoke up i know
because i was trying to borrow one this
afternoon to mount guard with

  a partially suppressed titter rose and
fell again the c o wheeled around
furiously

   so its you again is it he thundered
carousing in here while your superiors
attend to your duties get out to your
guard and put a stop to that indiscrim-
inate shooting i swear if i see you again
tonight ill prefer charges and have you
broke

  tommy stumbled out into the darkness
and headed in what he thought was the
direction of the guardhouse his head
was buzzing painfully a volley of
shots sounded somewhere in front of him
he felt vaguely that he ought to do some-
thing about it and ran in that direction
only to fall over the guy-rope of a hangar
and fall heavily more shots behind him
he got up and staggered on suddenly
there was a flash and a report right before
him then a voice veiled-

 halt


h p s greene

 commander of the guard bawled
tommy

  a dark figure loomed up vaguely in
the murk he struck a match and saw a
grinning cadet working the bolt of his
rifle and waving the muzzle around dan-
gerously suddenly it exploded and
tommy felt mud splatter over him

  i thought i saw something moving and
halted it and it wouldnt halt so i fired
but i dont understand this gun very well
sir said the cadet still working at the
bolt

  the commander of the guard turned
and fled he was getting dizzier every
minute finally he tripped over another
guy-rope and fell to rise no more

  when he woke it was with the con-
sciousness of having been annoyed for a
long time by a rasping noise which was
still going on he tried to pull himself
together and think he could vaguely
discern the bulk of a hangar there was
a queer unexplained rasping filed
wires- wings coming off- funerals-
the noise stopped and presently a dark
figure crept out through the hangar door
and started to steal away tommy drew
the little automatic from its holster and
fired the next thing he realized was
that there were flashlights and men
everywhere the sergeant of the guard
major krause calls for explanation
tommy tried to explain a voice said-
you fool youve shot the adjutant
strong hands seized him and hustled
him away

next morning when a detail came to
the guardhouse tommy was still in
a daze the leader told him to police up
as he was to go before the c o he was
still confused when he was led into the
office at headquarters

  the commanding officer was there and

captain la croix the french officcr who
advised as to instruction also a large
fierce man with stars on his shoulders
and a little civilian with glasses and a
trench coat several sizes too large for him
tommys legs seemed to be made of
butter

  major krause was speaking and
strange to say his voice was not unkind

  lieutenant lang he said i revoke
everything i said yesterday you have
done a great service for your country i
regret to say that a small file was found
on the body of the adjutant and that
some of the ships were found to have been
tampered with-so skillfully that detec-
tion was very unlikely inspection of the
adjutants papers brought out evidence
that he was an austrian citizen tell the
general and the secretary how you came
to discover what was going on

  well blurted tommy it was this
way i was dizzy and fell down two or
three times and finally i decided to go to
sleep then some guy kept making a
filing noise and waking me up so i shot
him

that evening three flying lieutenants
were finishing an illicit meal of
chicken and champagne at a little french
inn about three miles from the field and
the smallest of the trio was finishing a
story

  there was a long argument he said
and the general and the major were all
for preferring charges but captain la
croix stood up for me and said i was a
good pilot and finally they agreed to let
him get me transferred to a french ob-
servation squadron at the front

  the tall man and the fat one looked at
each other and at their little companion
then they ejaculated as one-

going on with

alan lemays novel of stirring
pre-civil war days on the mississippi

singed and burned captain arnold
huston stood amid the crowd that
packed the bluff and watched the last
pennons of flame and the billowing cotton
smoke that emanated from what had been
the mississippi steamboat peter swain
in that veteran sternwheeler the last
wealth of the hustons had taken to the
treacherous coffee-colored waters so
huston went back to natchez to the
old plantation house where he was born
it was now bleak and untenanted but as
he approached he heard a shot within
and investigating found his cousin will
huston prowling about will informed
arnold that he had foreclosed on the prop-
erty and it now belonged to him words
led to anger and arnold struck will who
demanded satisfaction with pistols

  for a second arnold chose a suave young
gentleman by name mark wallace who
first tried ineffectually to dissuade him
from going through with the duel and
then conducted him still suffering acute-
ly from burns to the home of a friend
to prepare himself for it here he first
glimpsed beautiful jaqueline dumoyne

  when arnold was well enough to dis-
cuss business wallace showed a knowl-
edge of the river trade that was amazing
to the steamboat captain it was wal-
laces plan to buy up some old river boat
refit it and offer part ownership and the
captaincy of it to his friend in the
midst of all this arnold was sent for by

caroline sheperd a young lady of means
and position with whom he had fancied
himself in love but she seemed unduly
concerned about will hustons welfare
and arnold came away with his heart
quite free but with a heightened interest
in jaqueline dumoyne from wallace he
learned the story of her past-of her un-
fortunate marriage to the reckless young
rake andrea dumoyne of his various es-
capades of his curious dagger duel in the
dark with jean fouchet and his flight and
mysterious disappearance into the bayou

  the cousins met for their affair of
honor arnold had decided secretly to
withhold his fire but will by nature ner-
vous was scared into firing by a jerk of
the others hand and arnold maddened
by wills shot blazed away blindly-a
shot that went wide of its mark but which
shocked will into a dead faint for this
the cousins hated each other more than ever

  it fell to arnold wallace to arrange
for a crew for the new steamboat project
without cash with but his word to offer
as security he sought out an old swamp-
rat walt gunn who lived by his bible
his rifle and by certain shady dealings
and this great bear of a man sensing
arnolds intense earnestness finally
agreed to deliver to him a crew of black
men arnold paid another visit to
jaqueline dumoyne and left strangely
out of sorts saying to himself-

  well ill never go there again
old father of waters

 arnold huston never felt better
in his life than the day that
- he first boarded the frontier city
a fresh breath of autumn was in the
air of the bayou country pleasantly
contrasting with the late hot spell in the
narrow new orleans streets from which

channel huston presumed that if the
frontier city had got up there once she
could get down again given an equal stage
of the river

 how long has the frontier city been
 up here he asked the pilot once

 only bout eighteen months

 river pretty high when she went up
 oh middlin high the man at the

he had come now hustons star was
conspicuously on the ascendent he was
eager to get his teeth into the labor ahead
his blood went through his arteries with
a zing making every muscle in his body
enthusiastically alive

  a stubby little sternwheeler had
brought him up the threading bayou be-
side which the frontier city lay six miles
from the main channel of the mississippi
the sluggish stream was so narrow that
the overhanging branches of cotton-
woods sometimes brushed both guards of
the little steamboat there had been an
encouraging amount of water there
however and as for the width of the

wheel considered for a time well-
heavy middlin i reckon shell float
next month i shd say

  huston craned for the first glimpse of
his prospective boat as the puffing stern-
wheeler at last opened the mouth of the
tributary bayou where the frontier city
lay his first glimpse of her was dis-
appointing she looked so definitely de-
cayed she was bigger than he remem-
bered her though measuring two hundred
forty feet from deadpost to transom and
now she looked larger than she really was
squatting broadly in the mud completely
bottling up the mouth of the inlet she
had chosen for her internment her three

decks towered imposingly ancient and
gray behind the leafy screen

  huston leaped to the bank without
need of the stageplank and the fussing
sternwheeler pompously shoved its way
on up the bayou in a trickle of water that
looked as if it would b rdly bear up a duck

  hi captain pumpernickel

  after an interval of alternate hailing
and chewing at bits of grass both without
result huston impatiently boarded and
ran up the leaf-drifted main stairway to
the boiler-deck a curious figure met him
at the cabins entrance

  captain pumpernickel im arnold
huston

  the captain of the frontier city was
struggling into a rusty old coat but he
now paused half-way in the process look-
ing more like a man taking off his coat to
fight than one dressing to receive guests

 who

  pumpernickel was aged it appeared
beyond all reckoning but he retained the
pinkness of skin of an over-washed child
his cheeks were drooping rounded folds
his nose a shorter and more bulbous fold
but equally drooping laid in the middle
beneath the apparently boneless nose his
mouth was an almost circular pucker
he was the only man huston had ever
seen that held a cigar straight out under
his nose as he smoked the shape of the
mans mouth seemed to explain that he
could have smoked no other way

  captain arnold huston the river-
man repeated

  well said the old man still poised
in the suspended struggle with his coat
you dont look it

  his voice was as dry as the windrowed
leaves with which the deck was cluttered
but his eyes were of a piercing blue
round and shiny as glass marbles he
inspected huston from the shoelaces up-
ward so that beneath the brim of his hat
only the flabby old face was visible until
as they traveled upward those round
blue eyes seemed to pop from under the
rim of the hat with an effect that was
startling

  no said arnold

  youre a boy the old man averred
dogmatically you got a face like a boy
anyways he added uncertainly you
have until ystart grinnin he slowly
drew his arms out of the coat sleeves again
and the garment collapsed to the deck
as if overwhelmingly relieved captain
pumpernickel let it lie what boat was
ycaptain on

  my own boat said huston the
peter swain she burned

  that so well im glad to see you
a captains a captain-even if he is ony
a boy ygimme a start at first i
thought ywas one o the capitalists i
been expectin em to come see about
buyin my boat

  he gave huston a hand like a skeleton
pasted over with parchment

  were they cornin today

 how

i say were the buyers cornin today
i dunno if they was cornin today
mebbe they aint cornin hope they
dont i jes said i was expectin em
how long have you been expectin
em huston inquired disinterestedly
peering past him into the cabin of the boat
how oh-about a year

  huston was surprized into shooting a
quick glance at him at this point there
appeared from the dark interior of the
cabin a lank high-hipped long-striding
cat of extraordinary size the animal
rubbed a small bony head with enor-
mously long ears against the cabin
timbers emitted two purrs so loudly that
huston looked down to see what had
broken loose and disappeared around the
corner of the cabin striding

  whos that huston demanded
how conversation with captain
pumpernickel required perpetual repe-
tition thats just a cat no par-
ticlar cat come with the boat al-
ways ben with the boat youre fidgety
askin who is a cat glad to see
ythough

 pumpernickel shook hands with
huston again in an undecided way as if
uncertain whether he had done so before
c not
old father of waters



  expectin to sell thats why i aint
keepin her up better dont want to go
throwin good money after bad dont
know whether them capitalists is cornin
or not leave em stay away want to
make a beggar out of a man wont pay
nothin hurtin no one but theirselfs
here captain pumpernickel mumbled off
into a procession of virulent blasphemies
that sometimes made his dry voice crack
like a whip and sometimes seemed to be
choking him with their invisible bulk
have a drink he concluded

  he had led the way inside to the
cabins best stateroom a compartment
equipped with a dresser and four-poster
bed instead of the usual bunks here a
stupendous confusion prevailed the
drawers of the dresser were half out dis-
gorging unlaundered linen old suits and
overalls were wrestling among themselves
on the floor on the bed and on the single
chair the doors of the wardrobe stood
open but only one or two things were
hung up inside a tray of dirty dishes
stood on the dresser and on the floor near
the door was a second over which captain
pumpernickel stumbled with a great
clatter and spluttering of oaths

  eat breakfast in bed he explained
in his dry voice cook it night before
wake up in mornin there she is by the
bed cold of course bettern gettin
up though man has to use his head-
pervide for himself

  rummaging he produced a squat
bottle and a pair of glasses that he
cleaned after some thought by wiping
with the disordered bed-spread

   well heres how

  luck responded huston tossing off
two fingers of brandy in a gulp

   place looks like a torpoon struck it
pumpernickel went on disconsolately
aint cleaned up lately man gets tired
cleanin up thats nigger work anyway
 i got better things tdo th my timen to
do work a nigger should be doin times
more valyblen that

  certainly huston agreed

  pumpernickel brooded his loosely
folded features drooping over his glass

  aim to live like a white man cant
no one do that by doin nigger work
wasnt always this way times has gone
to the dogs i used to be captain of this
boat im captain yet ill take her out
an run her pretty soon-if times get
better got to get capital first if i
dont ill have to get a ladder to get into
this room cant afford a nigger all i
got left is this boat little money not
enough to rent a nigger good boat
though damn her anyway god help
rivermen aint nothin but misery fer a
man runnin a boat

  look here said huston and captain
pumpernickel said how

  why dont you huston almost shout-
ed sell the old boat and get you a little
house and a nigger and live in comfort
cant get nothin for it pumper-
nickel said testily aint goin to sell
fer a price thatll keep me four or five
years then leave me without a roof over
my head they want to make a beggar
out of a man dont want to give
nothin jest as soon see the rightful
captain of the boat settin out in the rain
make em laugh say it serves the old
fool right no sir i wont do it de-
cided this aint a boat no more its a
house damn good house many a mil-
lionaire aint got the ekal this aint the
boiler-deck no more-this is the second
floor that out there aint the guards-
its the side gallery the texas-house is
the attic an the pilot-house is the look-
around cupolo the galley-

  the old man seemed game to follow out
the fancy indefinitely but huston grow-
ing impatient broke into the monologue

  captain i often meet men that might
be interested in buyin a boat-an
payin its full value too why dont you
let me look her over maybe i can find a
buyer for you

  how said pumpernickel cocking
his head to one side and huston went
over it all again when he understood
what huston was getting at the captain
of the frontier city remained unenthu-
siastic glad to show you the boat
though he decided


alan lemay

  with this he fell into a reverie his
glass-marble eyes goggling moodily at
hustons knees and he remained thus
for so long that huston almost lost hope
when loud throat-clearings failed to at-
tract the old mans attention he went
out to look over the boat for himself

  down the leaf-fouled stairs he went
feeling that the frontier city was a house
indeed squatting so flatly in the mud
and made his way back through the
rubbish of the deck-room to the hatch-
way of the hold there was water in it
of course the wonder to huston as he
peered down into the blackness by the
aid of a match was that there was not
more he could tell nothing by looking
in from above so he stripped off his
clothes and retaining only his long-
bladed knife lowered himself into three
feet of chill black water in the bottom

  the steamboat hold was of necessity
a shallow affair in the frontier city there
was hardly five feet of clearance between
the flooring and the timbers of the deck
above and this flatly cramped space was
such a forest of trunk-like uprights and
diagonal bracing timbers that a man
could hardly grope his way among them
the flooring went but a little way to
either side of the central passageway
where the timbers of the bottom itself
were exposed for some little time he
worked his way about feeling the wet
wood here and there with his knife
and he was both pleased and surprized
by the result finally he struck the
knife into the bottom timbers with a
great chunking splash and having broken
jhe blade in the hard wood was satisfied

  he turned back toward the dim light
of the hatchway through the black under-
water corridors a labyrinth like a
catacomb its flatness making the boat
seem from this viewpoint a vast levia-
than he was suddenly startled by the
vision of captain pumpernickels head
weirdly hanging skull downward through
the hatch the eyes were so glassy and
the flabby features drooping the other
way now were so motionless that huston
thought the man had fallen dead in the

act of leaning over the hatch a thin
strand of hair that huston had not
noticed before trailed downward from the
top of the old mans inverted head like
spanish moss

  the suspended head offered speech

  oh there you are down in the cellar
said the desiccated voice aint you
huh pumpernickel seemed anxious to
assure himself that nothing malignantly
mysterious was going on hey where
are you anyway

  im here in the hold huston shouted
suddenly fearful that the old man should
clamp down the hatch upon him in some
senile misconception here in the
hold

  cellar pumpernickel amended ab-
ruptly with an apparent loss of inter-
est the head disappeared only to de-
scend again a moment later your
cloes is up here said the head inanely

  i know it yelled huston

  captain pumpernickel withdrew hus-
ton could hear him mumbling to himself
above in the deck-room

  whats he doin clothes up here
arnh he put em here hisself-

  as huston had almost gained the hatch-
way again the flabby face was suddenly
thrust down again not six inches from
his own the cracked old voice shouted
mightily in hustons ear pumpernickel
evidently believing that his visitor was
still in the distant depths of the hold

  be you takin a bath he shouted

  no roared huston and the head was
snatched away

  the riverman pursued the remainder of
his examination swiftly and systemati-
cally captain pumpernickel pattered
after him relating long irrelevancies in
short sentences that alternately rose to an
ear-piercing rasp and sunk to unintel-
ligible mumbles before huston put on
his clothes he lowered himself from the
chocks and went diving and wallowing in
the muck under the boat as far as he could
reach in an examination of the outer
sheathing pumpernickel was still talk-
ing each time huston emerged from
the mud exactly as if he had never
old father of waters



noticed his guests submersion at all

  later as he bathed in a clear pool of
water a hundred yards aft the frontier
city huston studied the lines of the idle
boat with an increasing appreciation
at first sight she was homely enough but
her timbers were true as the day she was
made and he reflected with satisfaction
how trim she could look with her texas-
house reduced by half her boiler-deck
lengthened forward and fresh paint over
every inch of her dingy gray by the
time he had completed his inspection he
knew what he was going to do

  how would you like a job as mate on
a boat he asked tentatively

  how no sir pumpernickels ve-
hemence might have been surprizing had
not huston understood that the old mans
proposal to return to the river had no
grounding in actual intent never
said pumpernickel again i dont want
nothin to do with runnin no boat
misery not me i been through the
mill i got a good residence here i
know when im well off if i was offered
a thousand dollars a day id not-

  huston tried a new tack

  when i quit the river he said im
goin to live on somebody elses boat
ill take it easy and ill have everythin
a man could want cabin niggers to
clean out my room the best meals in the
country breakfast in bed-

  yes you will pumpernickel burst
out his drooping features quivered
with a suggestion of rage but his sharp 
blue eyes being perfectly round and
glassy could of course express nothing
when you get old youll be like me
youll turn your boat into a house be-
cause nobodyll give you nothin for it
takes money to be a cabin passenger
rivermen make money-ive made
plenty but what does it get you all
gets away leaves you where you
started from show me the riverman
that ever got anywhere every damn one
dies broke

  huston could have named an unlimited
number of rivermen who had gotten
somewhere but he did not trouble him-

self if you got enough money for your
boat to ride the river as a cabin passenger
the rest of your life would you sell

  dyou think im crazy

  how much do you ask huston de-
manded abruptly

  seventeen thousand said the dry
voice

  youre three times higher than youll
ever get huston told him

  captain pumpernickel stared at him
while he developed himself to a state of
complete enragement it took the great er
part of a minute for the old man to achieve
this but when it was accomplished he
fairly jiggled

  youre jest like the rest he shrilled
want to cheat me wont give nothin
dont care if-

  come down a little huston shouted
back at him come down within
reason

  not a damn ccnt not a damn cent
i wont hear-

  huston could hear the fussing stern-
wheeler poking her way back down the
bayou in not so many minutes her
stageplank would be out for him and he
would have the opportunity of leaving
his business unfinished or staying with
old pumpernickel until next day

  listen said huston so harshly that
the old mans tirade ceased ill give
you two hundred dollars a year for life
and-

  i wont hear it i wont- pumper-
nickel bounced up and down on the balls
of his feet

  listen huston checked him again
if you sell me the boat on those terms
ill put her on the river and ill give you
free cabin passage for as long as you live
ill sign a contract for that

  pumpernickel was given pause his
drooping features relaxed from their
temporary distortion

  how he said presently

  huston explained it again the prop-
osition soaked in slowly but when
it had penetrated it was plain that
most of the wind was out of the old
mans sails


alan lemay

  youll have to come higher he con-
tended querulously dont think you
can come it over me youre only a boy
i know what im about i-

  three hundred dollars a year said
huston and thats my last word

  the whistle of the sternwheeler was
shrieking for her landing with a volume
of sound suggesting that a mighty five-
decker was going to emerge from the
willows instead of a scant two decks with
a pill box of a pilot-house on top

im leaving on that boat said
huston are you interested or not
dont push me pumpernickel
warned him because i aint to be
pushed i-

  all right ill buy another boat
sorry we cant come to terms

  he thrust out his hand the old cap-
tain shook hands dazedly and huston
turned to the stairs

  where ygoin demanded pumper-
nickel coming to life lets talk this
over mebbe we can-

shall i bring the contract tomorrow
well-stay over captain we got to
talk this thing out i dont want to-
the bayou steamboat was sagging to a
stop at the mouth of the inlet a hail
came from her hurricane roof

  capn huston yuh cornin

  yes he roared back then to pum-
pernickel good-by captain

  he ran down the stair and sprang
across the grass-grown stageplank a
cry that was like a shout ofdespair hailed
him from the boiler deck of the frontier
city checking huston on the path
captain pumpernickel had come to the
rail he looked a pathetic figure stand-
ing there outworn and old by the bleared
woodwork of his boat he seemed to be
vainly pulling up against the droop of his
whole frame as if the tentacles of the
years were climbing up to gather him in
as the long stems of the wood-vines were
creeping up from the shore to cover the
frontier city and there were the marks
of a long despair in the loosely folded
face with the puckered lips as if the man
might be ghost-ridden by night

  bring the contract he shouted the
cracked voice was almost conciliating
bring it tomorrow wont do no harm
have a look an see what it is

  all right huston shouted back

  he grinned as he ran down the path

 xiv

huston and wallace had bought the
frontier city in early december
as christmas drew near arnolds plans
for his new boat were already taking
visible form

  these days were the happiest that
huston had known since he first had
taken possession of the ill-fated peter
swain the mississippi river at once
the background and the lifestream of
their project was at this season teeming
with a renewed life the cotton crop was
just beginning to bear down upon all
means of transportation with the full
weight of its mass and under their
towering loads the steamboats plied the
great waterway rejoicing parties of
planters and their families traveled the
river to st louis to memphis to vicks-
burg or to new orleans hastening to
brighten the holidays by expending some
part of the wealth promised by the crop
on the bigger boats bands played and
there was gayety and dancing every night

  down in new orleans the second port
of the nation the winter weather alter-
nated between periods of relenting sun-
shine when it seemed to be midsummer
once more and intervals of rawness in
which it rained every day at the same
time reports came down river that the
steamboat catty mandarin in attempting
a final run to st paul had become
locked in the ice and was indefinitely de-
layed waiting for a thaw

  the river was running high swelled by
the periodically thawing northern snows
but ultimate high water would come two
months later so that the fullest flood was
still well ahead similarly the high flood
of river trade was also ahead giving the
steamboat men reason to look forward
to prosperity still greater than that they
old father of waters



already enjoyed christmas was coming
high water was coming the boom days of
the crop were on their way and the
steamboats rushed at their work with
a song

  you could scarcely step out on to the
bank of the broad mississippi in those
days without sighting a steamboat at no
part of the river were their bellowing
whistles silent for long their good gray
smoke was almost always visible some
place to the people of the river-bottom
plantations encouraging them with their
implications of thriving trade and the
bright beckoning of prosperous towns

  through these days huston and mark
wallace worked in a frenzy of enthu-
siasm each in his own way the articles
of incorporation had been drawn up to
their satisfaction at last huston in-
sisting upon and obtaining a wide lati-
tude of control each of them had found
his work and his place

  mark wallace was proving himself a
business manager of no mean ability he
had grown haggard under the eyes before
those loans that he had arranged were
finally consummated but to hustons
cynical surprize he eventually delivered
all he had promised though it was doubt-
ful if he could have turned up a dollar
more had it been essential in the inter-
im between the floating of the loans and
the launching of the boat he was acting as
a purchasing agent in which role he was
proving himself equally efficient

   meantime the frontier city still squat-
ted in the mud for the high water that
was necessary for her extraction from the
bayou would hasten for no man nor
moderate itself for any when it came
until she could be floated out and taken
to drydock they could do little to repair
her hull they kept her pumped dry
within to discourage rot but the caulking
had to wait there was much however
that could be done where she lay
huston eager to have her ready in time to
get the benefit of the boom days of the
crop pressed the work forward with un-
ceasing energy

   since the frontier city could not go to

the yards for repairs men and materials
were brought to her remote retreat
cooks came first next two young men
appeared with drafting outfits for
some days they worked long hours under
hustons direction making measure-
ments and drawing plans here matters
seemed to pause for a bit but huston
labored with unflagging haste and the
final plans for the frontier citys alter-
ations appeared in his hands at last

  now the peace of the deep-hidden
bayou was disturbed in good earnest
great stacks of lumber were thrown
thundering on to her forecastle and the
next boat after its arrival brought a crew
of carpenters and their assisting slaves
thirty negroes each burdened with his
personal supply of sowbelly corn-meal
molasses and black-eyed peas now arrived
the first allotment of the slaves arranged
for by huston on his visit to that old
bear of the bayous walt gunn the
boat swarmed with life and the huge
galley-range was not again allowed to
grow cold

  all day long the clatter of hammers
sounded in the bayou in accompaniment
to the screech of drawn nails down
came the pilot-house and the whole
huge overbalancing structure of the
texas off came the whole front works
of the upper decks and cabin whose
stubbiness had always given the boat a
peculiar sawed-off repulsed appearance
stacks of rubbish beside the boat began
to grow the guards were piled with
nail-kegs tool-lockers rope coils tackle
rigging mill work straw-packed cases of
glass

  the framework of the extended cabin
and upper deck appeared giving in a
single day an entirely different swing to
the boats lines a new long low texas-
house took form on the hurricane roof
where the disproportionate one had once
caught the wind it was surmounted in
turn by a new pilot-house long and
commodious in place of the extraordinary
spindling tower that had served before

  the slaves from walt gunn were set to
work with scouring bricks holystone and


alan lemay

sandpaper dressing down the decks and
cleaning the scaling paint from the main
structure that was to remain they
sanded down the white and mahogany
woodwork of the cabin leveled the warp-
ing narrow boards of the decks made
every inch of her wood ready for new
paint

  through the reign of commotion cap-
tain pumpernickel survived in a daze
occasionally he offered an ineffectual
suggestion but for the most part he kept
out of the way nearly as well though with
less equanimity than that lank high-
hipped cat whose detached poise bore a
touch of genius

  but by far most important of all to
the destiny of the frontier city was the
advent of arthur macmaugh

  macmaugh was a steamboat engineer
an engine-room engineer in figure he was
singularly tall and bony in the extreme
he was not noticeably well proportioned
running to too great prominence of
wrists and knees but his hands from
which the engine-oil grime never quite
disappeared were at once powerfully and
delicately strong giving the impression
that they could with equal ease bend a
horseshoe out of shape or adjust the
mechanism of a watch

  he had a great rock of a head covered
with a shock of unkempt hair the color
of mud it was commonly in need of a cut
for macmaugh was accustomed to forget
about those things his big face was
irregularly lined into lumpy sections as if
he had carved it out himself from the
original rock with one of his own cold-
chisels and without the aid of a
mirror it was a strong face though
with prominent thin lips and eyes at once
kindly and very hard-bearing and he
was no more scotch in soul than the bag-
pipes of auchtermuchty

  macmaugh had not accepted the berth
on the frontier city unqualifiedly hus-
ton had been at pains toseek him im-
mediately upon his definite acquisition
of the boat he had tracked him down
at last in the engine-room of a sea-going
tug sitting with the engines after the

hours of his watch absently feeding him-
self a stick of cornbread with one hand and
making small figures in a notebook with
the other he had listened to hustons
story solemnly

  its my own private belief huston
told him that this boat has one of the
fastest hulls on the river shes not much
otherwise so i expect to make the most
of that ill do anythin within reason
to give her speed

  im no great hand on specifications
said macmaugh in his low rather thick-
tongued voice

  it isnt specifications i want huston
returned but an engineer

  and are there none idle macmaugh
asked

  there are idle men in every pro-
fession said huston ive had enough
of idle engineers

  macmaugh smiled and in the end he
agreed to come and have a look more
than that he would not say

  as they rode the river to the place
where the frontier city lay huston was
at pains to reveal to the engineer the
exact state of the finances of the boat
together with a somewhat modified ver-
sion of his own plans

  why do you tell me this macmaugh
asked

  because it is of interest to you

  it is not

  then you are not the man for the
job huston said

  of that we shall see said macmaugh

  when they at last arrived at the loca-
tion of the boat it was four oclock in the
afternoon but arthur macmaugh never-
theless slowly changed into overalls and
disappeared in the engine-room he was
submerged nine hours and seventeen
minutes by hustons watch during
which time they had to send him his
supper as he did not come out in answer
either to the bell or to personal hails
huston left him undisturbed during this
period judging as well as he could by the
occasional noises from the engine-room
what macmaugh was about

  at one time a loud prolonged battering
old father of waters



was heard as if the scotch engineer had
decided to wreck the entire equipment
with a sledge hammer again a call
came for firemen and for an hour and a
half thick twin columns of smoke poured
from the stacks just before the last of
captain pumpernickels wood supply was
exhausted the fires were drawn and
thereafter there was such a long silence
in the engine-room that huston was of the
opinion that the tall engineer had gone to
sleep

  a little after one oclock in the morning
however some time after huston had
sent midnight coffee down macmaugh
appeared on the boiler-deck and came to
slump into a chair beside huston there
was a silence

  what do you think of her huston
asked at last

  hopeless said macmaugh

  what seems to be thematter withher
  everything

  what are you goin to do

  go back to my tug when you have
decided what you are willing to put into
her you might let me know

  thats for you to decide said huston
disinterestedly

  what is

  what to put into her

  but you are the owner drawled
macmaugh

  you are the engineer i want to put
in an entirely different kind of hook-up
down there of course if you dont feel
equal-

  why didnt you say so in the first
place macmaugh demanded i have
spent the greater part of a night ex-
amining those engines

  huston grinned

  i thought you might be interested in
findin out what made her slow before
ugh said macmaugh

i want you to see to the purchase in-
stallation and management of the fron-
tier citys new power huston told him
if youre not the man for it say so
and if i wish to spend-

  i will affix my name to the checks
  but if i spend too much-

  you will break the company and the
boat will come back to her bayou you
know just what means we have for ive
told you i want a fast boat i think the
frontier city has the makings of one of the
fastest on the river

  aye said macmaugh sourly

  yes said huston

  macmaugh knocked out his pipe upon
the rail

  ill think it over in the morning he
growled and stumped off to his state-
room

  huston sleeplessly pacing the deck
with a headful of ambitious dreams
nevertheless perceived presently that
there was a light going in the engine-
room again and peering down the well of
the precipitous stairway he was enter-
tained by the sight of arthur macmaugh
sitting at the engineers station in a long
white nightgown smoking slowly it was
almost three oclock before the engine-
room was at last dark

  the ungainly engineer was at his re-
newed investigations early the next day
and for four days he appeared only at
meals sometimes he smoked for hours
his eyes apparently absorbed by some
inconsequential valve at other times he
made a great number of measurements
he was known to have spent a mysterious
hour and a half in the starboard paddle-
box again he prowled for an entire fore-
noon in the flat black galleries of the hold
one day he spent several hours with two
gangs of negroes who hauled a heavy rope
from stem to stem under the keel and
he used up all the stationery on the boat
by covering it with algebra it was ap-
parent to huston that macmaugh already
knew so much more about the frontier
city than he ever would that he was
made to feel he had bought a pig in a poke

  through it all macmaugh preserved an
attitude of the deepest gloom

  at eleven oclock at night following
the fourth day of his obscure investiga-
tions macmaugh sought out huston
for a time he sat facing the young cap-
tain his hands slowly rubbing his knees
he appeared to be engaged in the deepest


alan lemay

thought at last he addressed huston
with the air of one imparting a most singu-
lar discovery

  my friend he said with surprizing
conviction you have the makings of a
very fast boat

  the suggestion of a spark glowed deep
under the brows of the steel-gray eyes
for the first time since huston had known
macmaugh the man seemed brightened
by an actively living interest huston
was deeply gratified so much sothat he
did not even smile at the solemn restate-
ment of what he had told macmaugh in
the first place

  well said huston

  well said macmaugh

  will you undertake to power this
boat

  i will sir-under the arrangement
that you suggested

  send me the checks to be signed with
just a notation of what the main ex-
penditures were for

   ill start at once

  he left the mud-grounded frontier city
the next morning once thereafter in the
next six weeks he conferred with huston
as to the dry-docking of the boat other-
wise he did not appear either at the boat
or at the pigeonhole of an office that mark
wallace had set up in decatur street
from time to time word came from him
by messenger or by mail it invariably
consisted of a long list of expenditures
made out in macmaughs small neat
hand the account detailed down to the
last pennys worth of washers or bit of
waste

  arnold huston read these lists with
avidity partly because their very com-
pleteness assured him of the care mac-
maugh was taking that no time or means
should be lost once the frontier city was
afloat but chiefly because the lists told
him graphically of the progress made
toward powering his boat slowly he
read from week to week of the assembling
of the engines through the acquisition of
an extraordinary number of individual
parts found in diverse places it ap-
peared that macmaugh intended to

assemble his engines from the greatest
possible number of old wrecks hustons
faith in the scotchman however was un-
shaken and mark wallace was elated
at the smallness of the checks that were
clipped to each list for them to sign

  so time passed the carpentering and
interior work on the frontier city was done
she was ready to paint she was painted
all was ready for the water to come to
float her to her dry docks for hull work
and the installation of her engines they
waited it seemed interminably

  then at last in the last few days of
january the old yellow-brown river rose
and rose breaking a levee here ripping
cross-country to shorten a bend there all
concerned lived on the frontier city for
three days pacing restlessly drinking
much praying for that last necessary foot
of water it came and she floated
with macmaughs pumps singing the
brilliantly white boat took to the river
again floating high and proudly in spite
of the ignominy of being towed by that
stubby little sternwheeler

  well be at em soon huston said as
they stood on the moving hurricane roof
oh lord mark its damned near
time

xv

it was late in that long month during
which the frontier city lay in dock
that arnold was next sought out by his
cousin will huston found the riverman
in a cabin of the frontier city of course
arnold now heart and soul in the service
of his boat was seldom away from her
he never slept except in tbe captains
cabin in the texas and though his
thoughts sometimes turned against his
will to the house on the rue chartres
they for the most part followed the inter-
ests of the frontier city as hounds follow
a cottontail

  will huston came beautifully dressed
in the rather distinguished planters garb
that he affected he wore a long coat of
gunmetal gray and pleated shirt over
which hung a tie hardly wider than a
shoestring in long loops the carriage
old father of waters



of his head was proud though naturally
so so that the flared points of his very
high collar gave no appearance of dis-
commoding him but he was not so tall
that he needed to take off his soft hat to
go through doors and he did not remove
it as he entered hustons neat cabin

  mark wallace and arnold huston were
sitting at the latters narrow table
checking through certain lists of- supplies
mark rose and bowed slightly and very
coolly as arnolds erstwhile dueling antag-
onist came in arnolds nod was more
genial though suggestive of no respect
well say it suggested will huston
it seemed to arnold that the green-
gray eyes in the pale smooth face were a
little feverish above their dark circles

  i beg your pardon said the river-
man and there the cousins stuck staring
at each other like two waiting dogs

  i think your meaning eludes him
mark suggested to will

  i think not said will huston re-
garding the lean man at the table with a
sort of polite disgust

  i beg to differ said arnold i
havent the remotest notion what youre
standin there gogglin about

  it is my cousins gentlemanly cus-
tom said will huston to invariably
address me wherever we may meet by
saying well you ass 

  he mimicked arnolds voice more
odiously than realistically revealing the
evil state of his temper mark wallace
was forced to conceal sudden laughter by
choking in his handkerchief arnold
showed only a slight flush of irritation

  however will huston went on if
he is going to omit the usual formality
perhaps we may as well get on with the
discussion for which i came

  by all means said arnold lets
proceed at once with the quarrelia
whats the outrage this time

  that i think is a personal matter
between the two of us alone

  oh rubbish said arnold with annoy-
ance mark wallace is completely in
my confidence now out with-

  oh no protested mark his fine dark

eyes wandering sorrowfully from one to
the other youll most certainly excuse
me i am sure

  they did not object further as he went
out when the door had closed behind
mark will huston drew a light chair
near the table at which his cousin sat he
seated himself crossed his legs thrust his
hands deep into his pockets and for a time
stared moodily at his knees

  i hardly know how to make myself
clear to a person like you he said at last
he favored arnold with the briefest up-
ward flick of his green-gray eyes then fell
to contemplating his knees again

  regrettable said arnold cheerfully
you were born into a good enough
family will huston went on affecting
the air of the musing philosopher with a
success which his nervousness marred
i have heard that your father was a fel-
low without merit it seems fairly ap-
parent that this must be true

  the faintest suggestion of an ironical
smile tightened the rivermans thin lips
and disappeared again he watched will
huston with an expression of concealed
entertainment eyes half closed and mouth
partly open-an expression so unusual to
him that it came near giving will tho
fidgets when he glanced up at him again

  in any case it is an indisputable fact
that you have sacrificed your own social
position

  ah said arnold noncommittally
in what way

  you squandered your family fortune
you-

  i arnold interrupted which
one

  you and your father between you
then you threw away your opportunity
for an education you degraded yourself
to the level of a wharf rat its common
knowledge that you killed a man with a
chair in a natchez gambling dive-
you astonish me said huston
when was this

  do you mean to deny it

  no the incident may have slipped
my memory

  in any case youve got to be pretty


alan lemay

well known as a drunken brawler con-
sorting with the most disreputable asso-
ciates-

  it was impossible for will huston to
say these things to his cousin without a
high degree of perturbation he was at-
tempting arnold could see to give the
iron-and-velvet impression but his voice
was less cold and hard than he must have
wished it and an occasional tremor in the
muscles of his smooth face betrayed his
tension arnold became curious

  well what about it

  you persist in certain aspirations
will answered affecting the coldly pre-
cise which under the circumstances are
necessarily odious to all concerned he
looked at his cousin squarely and the
malevolence in his green eyes was
genuine

  arnold was mystified

  if i want to launch boats he said
im goin to launch boats and the rest
of the hustons can-

  i consider myself said will to be
speaking in the interests of the shepherd
family

so thats it arnold sat back
youre authorized to do so i suppose
you know as well as i do that earl
shepherd is the last man to delegate
any one else to speak for him

  oh youre self-elected then

  you can put it that way

  a very pretty display of cheek
arnold commented without heat

  will huston flushed

  you are very well aware he said
that caroline shepherds father is a
doddering old man living nowadays en-
tirely in the past its plain to anybody
that he hardly has sense enough left to
get himself fed and dressed and probably
wouldnt if it werent for his servants-
let alone being competent to guard the
interests of the young girl who happens
to be his daughter

  i certainly hope said arnold that
earl shepherd will appreciate your put-
tin in a word for him this way

  her mother will went on biting
down the resentment with which his

cousin always inspired him is a most
estimable woman but-

  now you be careful arnold advised
conversationally

  -but has led a sheltered life which
has certainly not fitted her for coping
with the schemings of unscrupulous
rivermen

  you make me sick said huston
you have seen fit will continued
forcing himself on through a situation
that though of his own making was yet
bitterly distasteful to him to take ad-
vantage of this circumstance to gain a
singularly objectionable hold upon the
mind of a virtually unprotected girl-
arnold suddenly exploded

  what do you mean sir

  exactly what i say-sir with a
terrific effort will huston maintained his
affectation of detached coldness even
forcing a tone of irony into the last word

  if i understand you said his cousin
i have every right to shoot you where
you sit

  it would be becoming to your char-
acter to shoot an unarmed man i have no
doubt on the other hand if you wish to
meet me again any time or place will
suit me last time you got off with a
slight wound i cant guarantee to be so
lenient another time

  were not gon through another long
rigmarole for the purpose of seein you
faint with fright at the sound of my
pistol arnold informed him your
last exhibition was sufficiently disgustin
will hustons face went scarlet with
rage his eyes blazed greenly for a
moment arnold thought will would fling
himself bodily across the table he par-
tially recovered himself however

  i came here to warn you will got
out at last trying hard to bring his
quivering voice back to a level of cold-
ness i persist in my intention

  he paused seeking to control himself
and arnold said judicially-

  come on with the next insult

  your insolence may be monstrous
said will huston but you nevertheless
find yourself in a singularly precarious
old father of waters



position his voice was more success-
fully menacing than huston had ever
heard it i happen to know better than
any one else perhaps just what your
ambitions are and how much they mean
to you i also know exactly what you
have been doing and how for one thing
you have gone into bankruptcy on the
strength of the burning of the peter
swain immediately on top of that you
have formed another company i know
exactly where you got the capital for that
and how

  very clever i must say

  how you persuaded mark wallace is
a mystery to me i can only think that he
is an idle-headed dreamer easily over-
borne anyway the mass of your re-
sources came from him more than that
i know just where he stands financially
i dont know whether you know it or not
but wallace has put himself into a re-
markably fragile financial position half
his funds rest on call notes and the other
half are unstable

  your interest is flatterin but-
you may not realize it but you are
walking a singularly unsteady financial
tight-rope

  well

  i dont think you are so badly in-
formed that you dont know that i am
now the controlling factor in very large
financial interests

  as nearly as i can judge arnold
agreed your fathers death slid you into
a very soft thing hardly so big though
as it seems to you when you have every-
thin all muddled up

  you are too poorly educated of
course will huston went on insolently
to know anything about the wheels
within wheels that control the financial
world youll have to take my word for
it that i can personally be a considerable
factor you happen to be wrong in
thinking the interests im handling are
small but even if you were right a small
cog in the situation can move the whole
machine

  will huston had found opportunity to
recover his mental balance before

arnolds relaxed air of interest he went
on coldly with his eyes keen and narrow

  you now have a chance for success i
hold nothing against you i shall be glad
to see you attain it at the same time i
consider that you are acting reprehen-
sibly and out of all proportion to your
station in aspiring to caroline shepherd
arnold hustons increase of interest was
sudden and unfeigned

  what did she say that threw you into
this panic will

  she has never mentioned your name
you think my absence has depressed
her or somethin like that

  she has been nothing at all but her-
self

  you said a funny thing awhile ago
arnold insisted somethin about some
hold you thought i had on the girl youll
have to explain that i think

  i am a student of character said
will according himself the most popular
bit of self-flattery known to man i
have an unusual faculty for reading
people

  is that all you base your silly assump-
tions on

  sufficient i think will answered
flushing

  in short arnold pursued you cant
make any headway yourself so naturally
you blame me

  wills gorge was visibly rising again
thats entirely outside the point he
declared

  well then

  will huston with a heroic effort
whipped himself into the attack

  i mean to say this you are entirely
unfitted by your own choices to-to
enter the shepherd family and i wish to
propose-forcibly propose that you with-
draw from the situation absolutely and
entirely

  will will youre outdoin your-
self

  dont be in a hurry to laugh my tight-
rope walker

  what

  will huston rushed on furiously in a
stumbling torrent of words


alan lemay

  if you pertinaciously continue your
intrusions-

  intrusions

  you dont deny that you are courting
caroline shepherd

  i deny that its any of your damned
business if i am or not

  if you go on with that you are going
to lose and lose heavily you were only
a wharf rat to begin with and youll be
just that and no more again if you persist
in thinking that your interests are sep-
arable from my assistance

  dyou mean youre offerin a bribe
your financial predicament is a very
perilous one im certainly not offering a
bribe im calling your attention to a
situation will was white-faced and
trembling

  a threat then

  call it that if you want to

  arnold sat back to study the spectacle
that his cousin presented and his chief
emotion was that of mystified amaze-
ment looking at the other calmly for
all his annoyance with the man huston
was at a loss at first to account for his
cousins extraordinary outbreak

  he cant be so stupid arnold was
thinking that he believes he can handle
me that way

  wills smooth rather round-cheeked
face was paler than usual in his self-
punishing wrath but there was a quiver
in the mans voice and a suppressed
flame in his eyes that might have been
madness for all arnold knew

  in the first place arnold thought
analytically he hates me he has always
hated me when i look him in the eye i
have the edge on him and he hates me all
the more for that now hes gone out
of his head over this girl he leads him-
self to believe that i stand in the way he
frets and fumes getting a little crazier
each time he is checked he persuades
himself that i am doing the girl a wrong
in addition to discommoding him fi-
nally he comes here wild-eyed and makes
a desperate silly play-

  but arnolds logic was unconvincing to
himself never having been out of his

head over a girl he could not compre-
hend wills state even when he had dia-
gramed it

  what the devils the matter with
you he demanded suddenly

  not nearly as much as you might
wish i find myself in a dominating
position i think

  i congratulate you

  by god will burst out ill take the
damned mockery out of you if its my last
act he got up so suddenly that his
chair upset with a futile small clatter
his nostrils were white and trembling

  arnold was angered by sheer contagion
a moment before he had pitied his cousin
almost to the point of telling him that he
had no further interest in caroline shep-
herd and that she certainly had never
had any interest in him but the tension
had become too much for him and his
temper broke

  you fool he cried dyou think you
can

  he was grinning the strong teeth and
the thin creases of the cheeks taking the
youth out of his face his smile could be
an ugly sort of thing

  well damned well find out

  will hustons anger was not explosive
and destroying as was arnolds like
most of his other violent emotions it
turned inward tightening his muscles
until he was racked with the tension
thus the door did not slam after him as he
went out but closed uncertainly with a
shaking latch

  when he was gone mark wallace re-
turned

  you missed something said huston
dryly your delicacy is too great for
your own advantage

  my delicacy did not prevent me from
listening on the other side of the par-
tition said mark with a faint smile
what the devil do you want to have
love affairs for this is a fine time for it
i must say

  i havent any love affair will and i
have nothin in common in that respect
nor in any other

  but will-
old father of waters



  he doesnt know what hes talkin
about-as usual as far as caroline
shepherd is concerned im out have
been for a long time

  then why in gods name didnt you
tell him so

  i wouldnt tell him anythin dyou
mean to think he can come here and-
oh your damned stiff-necked pride i
suppose said mark with some heat i
suppose you know that this silliness is apt
to put us all in a very ticklish position
ybu mean he can carry out his
threats

  mark considered he seemed to be
trying to give a fair answer

  i dont know he decided

  well its up to you to see that he
doesnt said huston testily finance
is your end steamboatin is mine

 thats all very well-if youd stick to
steamboating but if you go pulling three
or four banks down on our heads youre
liable to find yourself without any steam-
boat and putting the responsibility off
on me isnt going to get her back either
well what the devil do you think i can
do about it

   if worst comes to worst youll have to
eat crow thats what youll have to do
my friend you may have to apologize
to him and ask him to call off his dogs
can you imagine my doin that
mark

  i can imagine your breaking yourself
and me too if you get one of your damned
bull-headed streaks

   it isnt as if said huston soberly it
would do any good if i did you have
no idea of the bitterness of that man
oh rubbish a quarrel over a girl-
that has almost nothin to do with it
my father and my uncle were bitter
enemies before i was bom they-
oh another pack of rubbish

  not altogether the quarrel had its
beginnin in the existence of will huston
himself

  what has-

  will huston thinks hes my cousin
hes not

  hes not what

  hes not my cousin were closer than
that it happens hes my half-brother
what

  wills mother died at his birth my
uncle accepted will as his son knowing
that he was no such thing

  how do you know

  i have my fathers word for it
  but-

  no one knows it but myself now that
my father and dennison huston are dead
im tellin you now because you were
gettin ready to try to force a situation
you knew nothin about now if you
have the intelligence i credit you with
maybe you can imagine my uncles bitter-
ness toward my father and myself may-
be you can appreciate their family religion
-that anastasius hustons breed is to be
squelched at all costs

  they sat looking at each other

  now said arnold what do you
think of that

  i think said mark wallace dryly
that ive bet into a stacked deck
youll have to make the most of it

u never come to see me any
x more jacqueline dumoyne said
he had visited her perhaps half a dozen
times in the last two months it seemed
to him however as if he had haunted her
beyond all reason his days and a good
part of his nights had been filled with
the labor involved in the making ready
of the frontier city he certainly had
had enough to fill his mind and make
dreamless his short hours of sleep yet
each time he left her house he had im-
mediately begin thinking about when he
would see her again he would put it off
as long as he could avoiding the issue
from day to day until he could deceive
himself no more his self-deception had
been fairly successful and the intervals
between his visits correspondingly long
but she didnt know of course how
many times at late hours of the
night he had walked past that great
arched door


alan lemay

  i wonder that you let me come at all
  i shouldnt i know

  why he asked defiantly

  she ignored that

  tell me about the boat

  shell launch saturday

  captain you sound as if you didnt
care if she launched at all

  im tired i guess getting old i
cant remember that i used to get tired
at all

  old at twenty-seven she always
knew more about him than he had ex-
pected

  im older than you are anyway
does that have to be so terribly old
he felt the blackness of a bitter mood
closing on him as they sat down on the
settee it brought the bracketing lines
to the corners of his mouth and made his
eyes at once sultry and hard-edged he
sat rigidly his knees crossed staring out
across the night-dimmed roofs to the
river

 he was thinking of his fathers
words-

  if you are going to hunt turmoil all the
time turmoil is going to begin hunting
you-

  this was the place where they always
sat where they could look out at the
steamboats and the shipping he thought
it must be an interesting place to sit
resting by daylight when you could see
the river traffic come and go watching
perhaps the deep-sea vessels starting
for foreign ports and the busy steam-
boats beginning the daily race upriver
probably you could see the sailors in the
rigging the pilots throwing their weight
on the great wheels but he had never
been there except at night

  often on other nights as he leaned on
the rail of the frontier city and drew
deeply on a black cigar he had thought
of this settee and this window but not in
terms of the river he had remembered
rather the tones of jacqueline dumoynes
low voice the darkness of her eyes the
sensitively changing expressions of her
pale face as delicately molded as a
childs these fancies had been pleasur-

able at first when he tried to put them
down they became a torment for his
every idle moment

  he knew well enough what was the
matter with him two months before it
had been inconceivable to him that he
should ever love any one but caroline
shepherd he had loved her desper-
ately enough for a while even after he
had been wearied by her silly apprehen-
sions for will hustons welfare and her
blank-minded prejudice against the river
she still remained to him the embodiment
of an ideal he had judged all beauty by
hers

  jacqueline dumoyne was in no sense
a substitute for caroline but a person-
ality entirely new to hustons experience
her attraction for him was a thing he had
not sought nor desired rather some
mysterious intoxicant that he felt in her
presence had permeated him making him
see suchidepths of beauty in her as he
knew it was impossible for a wholly sane
man to perceive it gave him a gnawing
restlessness so that when he was not
grinding over paperwork at his desk he
was never still for long

  one of his attributes had been an
ability to rest completely when his work
was done that was gone now where
once he had sat smoking and looking at
the water late at night before turning
into his bunk he now paced the guards
quarreling with his own imaginings to all
hours of the night some nights he gave
up sleeping altogether only flinging him-
self down fully clothed for an hour or
two of restless dozing just before day-
light sometimes he woke to find that he
had rolled to his feet and gripped the
mist-damp sill of his stateroom window in
the moment of waking as he had done the
last night of the peter sioain but each
time as he came to his senses it was to
realize that it was not of fire that he had
dreamed nor of boats

  reason told him that jacqueline du-
moyne was not of his kind she seemed
subtly of a different race an exotic thing
that he could not hope fully to know or
understand she was almost as unreal to
old father of waters



him as his ill-formed notions of the island
from which she had come hustons
background was of practical things the
people the smells the boats of the
mississippi were the normal homely
things of his life familiarity had worn
away the picturesqueness and romance
that had lured him to the river as a child
his one creed was accomplishment his
one field of action the steamboat life of
the river

  in this direct scheme of things jacque-
line dumoyne had no previous counter-
part only the sight of the mississippi
gave him any assurance of reality in this
new phase of his experience new orleans
was becoming a strange place to him its
french-spanish buildings took on a
brooding and unfamiliar look so that as
he walked between them he felt a thou-
sand miles away from the familiar plan-
tations and the river towns of country-
like homes or brawling dives

  it did not seem to him logical or
reasonable that jacqueline dumoyne
should ever become his wife to imagine
her settled in a natchez home seemed
preposterous he certainly could not
tolerate her merely as a friend to think
of her as more than a friend and less than
a wife was incompatible with his view of
her however he did not reason into
that he was sufficiently absorbed in his
endeavor to suppress a passion which at
its flood-tide would be too deep-flowing
and strong of current for mastery and
he feared the growing hidden power of it
as the steamboats themselves feared shoal
water

  what is to be the name of your new
boat captain

  i wanted to ask you about that i
thought- i was thinkin maybe you
would give her a name

  oh id have no right to do that

  right her name is what i choose
and if i want her to be what you call
her-

  no no i wouldnt feel i could
dont you think mark should be con-
sulted perhaps he has something in
mind

  the black mood was closing in he
felt a slow anger well up seething and
fighting for expression that single pene-
trating thing his father had said returned
to him and for an instant he sent a flash
of dark hate after his fathers ghost
almost believing that his father had truly
foreseen the torment in which his son sat
tonight

  if you are going to hunt turmoil all the
time turmoil is going to begin hunting
you arnold muttered

 what-why did you say that
there was a breathless catch in her voice
so slight that he was not sure that he had
detected it at all

  im sorry i reckon i didnt aim to
speak aloud what did you think i said
he hardly ever spoke her name he
was too stiffly bound by convention to
call her jacqueline and he would not say
madame dumoyne

  why-nothing i thought for a mo-
ment that you had said something that
might have applied to me it was nothing
at all

  he wanted to probe that a little way
but the anger that had been aroused by
the reference to his friend had left a
lassitude upon him

  youre paler than usual he said when
he turned to her again

  im tired of this place her tone was
not one of weariness in it there was a
hint of something uneasiness perhaps
that made her words meaningless

  whats worryin you here he asked
suddenly

  she gave him a startled flicker of a
glance but her eyes were immediately
calm as she looked up at him again
what makes you ask that

  he shrugged he thought-

  so something is worrying her

  he was curiously indifferent absorbed
in his own mental disorders

  dont answer if youd rather not
he had sense enough to add whatever
it is i want you to know im sorry
theres nothing worrying me

  he looked at her searchingly and
found her eyes upon him with an odd


alan lemay

quiet intensity she looked sober almost
sorrowful in her pale face her eyes were
dark and deep and he possessed no lead-
line for their fathoming some somber
flame he thought was burning behind
them its meaning he did not know but
he thought it was neither love nor hate
and it was too quiet for fear

  it seemed to him that he could not en-
dure looking into her eyes yet he could
not look away he freed himself with an
almost physical wrench the tumult of
battle was in him a battle over which
hung the pall of coming defeat he felt
the desperate need of a drink of a smoke

  if you are going to hunt turmoil all the
time- the voice of his father mouth-
ing fatality

  no he couldnt deceive himself it was
the woman he wanted her dark gown
was close about her throat tonight yet
the white gleam of her shoulders tor-
mented him a memory clearer than
vision he wanted to press them with
his lips

  he could turn and take her in his arms
but he intuitively believed that it would
mean a defeat which he was by no means
ready to bear he suddenly got up
she looked surprized

  youre going

  ive work to do got to get back to
my boat

  i never knew of a man working as
you do

  were nearly done now

  just as he left she said-

  please tell mark i want to see him
her voice was quiet but there was in it
he thought something as pleading as a
cry his imagination perhaps but it was
enough to send him into another fit of
jealous rage what could mark do for
her that he could not

  he strode up and down for a long time
on the levee waiting for some boat to get
ready to take him to the frontier city
he smoked furiously champing at the
delay

  at last he flung down the cigar butt
and tried to grind it out with his heel it
took refuge between the cobbles and lay

staring up at him with its one foolish eye
huston sat down on a string-piece and
rested his forehead on his hands

if youre going to hunt turmoil-

xvii

it was about this time that huston
made his second visit to the swamp
retreat of walt gunn certain supplies of
molasses and cornmeal were three weeks
late and the riverman went to find out
why

  as before it was nine at night when he
landed from an upriver boat at the foot
of that scratch of a road marking gunns
landing the night was cold and raw for
that latitude with a whisk of rain in the
air a perpetual wind fled through the
cottonwoods with a faint whistling moan
that always sounded far away yet grew
neither nearer nor farther as he walked
inland miles overhead a mat of vast
scudding clouds was perceivable but so
dimly that it seemed they were felt
rather than seen on the earth lay an
inky blackness thickest near the ground
from which it seemed to rise like fur
twenty feet deep

  the night birds were silent this time
over the planted lands and there was not
even the voice of a frog in the swampy
bottoms where the river once had run
but from a mile away he heard the voices
of gunns dogs a continual wailing and
belling in twenty keys so that a man less
conversant with hound talk would have
thought a big hunt was in progress it
made him uneasy

  the back-water was high in the old
river bed that lay between the mississippi
and the cabins of walt gunn huston
was in some doubt as to whether he would
be able to reach the place at all cer-
tainly there was no hope of shouting
across the half-mile of muck jungle for a
boat he found the water lapping over
the edge of the road through the swamp
but it had been built high and well if
walt gunn had nothing else he at least
had plenty of labor at his command his
road stood against the sluggish water
old father of waters



  at the lowest point the filled road was
submerged the blackness was so thick
here that it seemed tangible but huston
felt his way ahead he waded through
knee-deep water knowing that at any
minute the edge of the road might cave
under him sending him into soupy mud
over his head in the dark he splashed
directly into the kingpost of the drowned
bridge hurting his knee after that the
road raised a little slogging in the mud
he reached the steep rise that had been the
rivers farther bank

  in the time that he had spent working
his way over the last half-mile of swamp
road the belling of the hounds had never
ceased it rose to a clamor as he climbed
the rise the poorer of the hounds breaking
out of their long tonguing into frantic
barkings and yelpings he could hear a
whole row of them on the crest of the rise
ahead of them and though he could not
see them he knew they watched his ap-
proach they gave back as he advanced

  the dark was impenetrable among
gunns invisible cabins not a pin-
point of light not a suggestion of the out-
line of a building was discernible

  hi he shouted any one home
no answer he advanced slowly feel-
ing for the path trying to remember ex-
actly where gunns own cabin had been
the hounds retreated maintaining a
timorous distance while their mad so-
prano bellowing killed even the sound of
the wind one deeper throat sounded
over all the rest its interminable varia-
tions seemed never in need of breath as if
the dog were desperately pouring out some
mournful explanation

  howp howoowhoop yipoohoop hooo-
wowp -

  hullo hey walt gunn

  still no response out of the inky black
he went forward shouting and presently
his groping hands found the lean-tos
door there he stood for a while calling
and kicking the boards the splash
through the swamp had been long and
disagreeable he was loath to turn back
without result he determined to enter
the cabin strike a light and make himself

at home pending the return of some one
who could at least give him information
as to gunns whereabouts

  nevertheless he did not step into
gunns lean-to without some hesitation
the gun-barrel that had jabbed into his
middle the last time he had done so was
clear in his memory he half expected
a recurrence of the incident and his
stomach muscles tightened as he crossed
the threshold

  as he disappeared within the cabin the
howling of the hounds diminished on
the outskirts of the cabin group they still
gave tongue in long wails as dogs howl at
the moon but they were quiet enough so
that he could have heard even a small
sound within

  the inner door was partly out of line
with the door of the lean-to and huston
crashed into the jamb an oath escaped
him before he could collect himself again

  walt gunn he called its huston
are you there

  groping with one hand he started to
step in instantly a crashing explosion
rocked him back upon his heels buck-
shot screamed past him splintering the
door jamb of the lean-to rattling away
into the foliage thirty yards beyond

  hustons spring aside was purely in-
stinctive as he recovered from the daze
of the shock he found himself flattened
against the wall of the cabin his pistol in
his hand yet his reason had had no
more part in putting him into that posi-
tion than as if he had been lifted there by
the heavy breath of the shotgun that had
so nearly accounted for him

  his first emotion when his hair had
settled to his scalp again was one of hot
anger he speculated for a moment or
two as to what he should do meantime
listening for some stir of sound within the
cabin that would tell him what his assail-
ant meant to do next then he jammed
his pistol back into the shoulder holster
under his arm and stepped squarely into
the opening of the door

  well you damned fool he said his
voice quivering with rage why dont you
let go with the other barrel


alan lemay

  no answer came out of the dark the
interior exhaled a faint breath of burned
gunpowder mingling with a remembered
smell of coffee-grounds old food and
sweat but huston could not hear so
much as the stirring of a rat

  i told you who i was he went on
loudly before i came to the door
youll kill somebody with your damned
foolishness one of these days no an-
swer no rustle of movement well he
shouted are you going to answer me or
not

  the eery silence within remained un-
broken he produced a match his fin-
gers were trembling nervously as he
ripped it along the wood the match was
wet and its spongy head scraped off like
damp bread leaving a green streak of
phosphorus glowing on the door jamb in
the dark

  his impatience keyed to the breaking
point as he failed with a second and a
third his bravado ebbed away and he
stiffly moved out of line with the door
as he stood with his back against the
square-hewn logs of the wall he considered
the advisability of carrying his investiga-
tion further reason counseled retreat

  ahead of him was a pitch-black hole of
a room from which he had already been
fired upon without cause it was not his
cabin conceivably he had no business in
it without invitation walt gunn or
whoever had fired upon him was more
than likely in a state of drunken insanity
yet as he considered withdrawing he
became aware that this in itself was a
dangerous course he decided he must
finish what he had begun

  one by one he tested the matches
there were a half-dozen left if they
failed he would be faced by the task of
walking into that black silent dark with-
out a light there were three left there
were two the next to the last match
flared hissed died-then sprang into
flame again and burned

  instantly huston stepped forward into
the doorway

  easy now he said easy

  immediately before him was the table

on it a dirty huddling shirt a pile of
clothes were mounded in one corner but
there was no one there

  that was all he saw before the match
burned his fingers he hastily lighted the
last match from the waning flame of the
other and held it high in cupped hands
on the rough plank that served as a
mantelpiece stood a candle hurriedly
cuddling the feeble flame of the match
stick in his hands he stepped across the
room and lighted the wax

  by its light he perceived that there was
a great ragged hole in the shirt upon the
table through it the muzzle of a shotgun
glinted dully he tossed the shirt aside
on the table lay that massive bible that
gunns hands had gripped and fondled
the night of their conference across it
the shotgun lay braced by heavy nails
and lashed down with leather cords
from the trigger ran a string cunningly
rigged and concealed as if by a trappers
hands his eye traced it to the doorway
where the end of it dangled broken

  huston cursed in utter exasperation
there was a slab door in the back wall
with a hole in it that might have been in-
tended for espionage he supposed that
he was being watched

  well come on out he ordered
dyou think i waded that damned
swamp to stand here and be stared at

  he persisted in regarding the gunplay
as childish unworthy of resjtful treat-
ment he gave the rear door a terrific
kick that would certainly have broken the
nose of the watcher had there been one
the door slatted open revealing a back
room that was smellier if anything than
the one in which he stood a cot a stove
a broken chair a cupboard a litter of mis-
cellaneous rubbish were all it contained
huston walked through it and stood in
the back door swearing

  outside the night seemed blacker than
ever after the temporary relief of the
light as his eyes became a little ac-
customed to the dark he could make out
the ragged line of the tree-tops beyond
blacker than the pit-like sky at the
foot of the trees he thought he could
old father of waters



detect a slight stirring of darkness where
the hound pack shuffled itself lurking on
the extreme outskirts of his vision
their weird yelling droned on without
haste without weariness those dogs were
professional at that sort of work

  a shapeless form came writhing swiftly
along the ground toward him no more
recognizable than some strange thing in a
sack then the mystery came into the
dim shaft of candlelight from the door
and materialized into a great floppy
hound-bitch she wallowed slathering to
his feet with whimpers that were sup-
pressed howls when he spoke kindly to
her she moved close against his legs never
ceasing her deep-throated whines

  he turned back into the cabin in search
of a lantern the great floppy bitch
crouched on the threshold trembling and
belling hollowly in her throat huston
found a certain comfort in her presence
useless as he knew she would be to him in
any conceivable circumstance she pro-
vided at least the companionship of a
living and comprehensible thing a
certain sympathy for her was compelled
by the fact that she had come seeking
him as a friend

  come in here he commanded

  the big loose-knit hound put one foot
forward reluctantly then drew back and
turned away her face low-headed with
shame that she disobeyed him but fear-
ing some other thing more

  he found the lantern he sought and
with the stick of a burned match trans-
ferred a flame to it from the candles tip
then he strode out the rear door toward
the slave quarters the dog slunk close
to his legs whimpering and nudging his
knee repeatedly with her nose so im-
portunate was she that huston thought
the dog wished to take him to some-
thing but when he stopped and asked her
to lead the way she sat down apparently
desirous of nothing from him but the
reassurance of his approval

  one advantage was brought to him by
the hound-bitch her dog-talk drew a
great hulking mongrel from the ranks of
the skulkers a silent brute with a cold

yellow eye and a perpetually bristling
roch on his shoulders this dog ac-
companied them at a little distance with
suspicious snufflings but at each of the
cabins at which huston paused the
mongrel took the lead walked through
the black open doorways ahead of him
and for a few moments was lost to the
lantern rays he reappeared still bris-
tling still at a walk but bearing the per-
fectly lucid information that the cabin
was empty of life

  huston made his way from one cabin to
another calling out pounding on doors
his nose found the odor of unwashed
negroes molasses old blankets and dogs
but human beings there were none
sometimes not trusting the word of the
mongrel who went ahead he explored the
interiors of the cabins on his own account
he found evidences that breakfast had
been cooked that morning but no meal
since

  by some subtle chain of observations
perhaps influenced by the uncanny
quality of the night he gathered an im-
pression of haste and disordered flight
in one negro cabin a rude chair lay over-
turned in another on a crumby table
lay a square of corn-pone with one bite
out of it still showing the indentations
of big teeth mice had been at it since
across a threshold lay a pickaninnys
doll crudely made of a stick of wood a
strange little thing like an african idol
it lay disheveled abandoned but grinning
toothily yet

  at the farthest edge of the clearing
huston stood for a bit staring moodily
off into the night beyond him was a
tangle of live-oak and cottonwood under-
growth the lantern light outlined a
great down-sweeping live-oak limb twist-
ing aged thick as a mans body it
drooped downward until it almost touched
the ground apparently overborne by its
own weight then curved upward high
into the night like some monstrous seeking
snake the bearding moss trailed down-
ward from its bark gray filmy like the
dust-dry residue of centuries of tears
it swung limply in the little wind that


alan lemay

came under the trees so that beyond in
the faint yellow light of the lantern
certain shadows swayed and shifted
stealthily the dimmest stirring of some-
thing half perceived

  the big-boned mongrel walked on his
shadow lengthening ahead of him dis-
torted on the bare sandy soil

  come back here huston ordered
he had already decided to go no farther

  the yellow dog choosing not to hear
went on with his stiff unhurried strides
the whorls of hair on his haunches made
them look ungainly like a baboons he
disappeared into the blackness and did
not return there had been a certain
detachment about that dog even while
he had been aiding huston as if he had
slowly developing purposes of his own
that were not to be suborned the great
hollow-throated bitch took a few steps
after him then sat down and howled once
she immediately returned to huston and
resumed her inconvenient proximity to
his legs

  huston felt ironically disgusted with
the whole situation even so as he
passed one after another of the silent
shanties he experienced a prickly sensa-
tion up and down his spine he could not
down the recurrent feeling that some-
where behind him a lurking enemy
watched once he felt this so strongly
that he turned and walked back to a
cabin that he had passed and entered its
gaping door a rat half the size of a cat
leaped off a rickety table plunked
heavily on the slab floor and scuttled
away he knew by its presence that
nothing else had been there and he went
on swearing at himself

  the candlelight was still wavering in
the cabin of walt gunn when he had
slammed the lantern on to the table with
a jolt that nearly put it out he lighted a
lean cigar and sat down beside the table
with crossed knees the big bitch once
more remained moaning at the rear door
with wide-braced forelegs ears nearly
touching the ground this time he put
her from his mind along with the in-
cessant eery clamor of the hounds

  he sat for a long time with his hands
thrust deep into his pockets scowling
out into the dark it did not occur to him
that the trap in which he had almost lost
his life was not as good a place in which
to sit and think as any other he
champed his lean cigar rolled it from
one corner of his mouth to the other with
his tongue

  he was lost in thought when something
stirred behind him in the comer of the
cabin it seemed a stealthy movement
over the floor warningly subtle yet so
magnified by the silence that had pre-
vailed in the room that huston thought
of no other possibility than that a man
had moved there he was instantly on
his feet pistol in hand facing the comer
from which the sound had come

  behind him the cabin was as empty as
ever in the comer that great lumpy
mound of dirty clothing lay as before it
was something of a shock to him to find
that no one faced him there the dis-
quieting idea came to him that some one
was concealed under that disproportion-
ately large pile of clothes he took a
quick step toward it but instantly
checked with a feeling of revulsion as he
saw disappearing under the clothing the
scaly limp tail of a rat

  he blew a puff of breath at the gut-
tering candle and when it persisted to
bum he swore and smashed it into a
puddle of wax with the palm of his hand
taking the lantern with him he strode
out toward the river road

xvih

huston caught a down-river boat a
little before one oclock

  the chill of the night had increased
with the lateness of the hour he got a
blanket from his stateroom and flung it
about his shoulders as he began his now
almost habitual pacing of the guards
astern to the hot oily breath of the
engine-room ladder forward to the bow
rail astern again

  the mississippi spread black under a
starless sky the inky line of the shores
old father of waters



a mile apart could hardly be seen by the
casual eye but there was no fog and no
precautions had been taken to dim the
boats lights or the gleam from the fire-
alley that reddened the ripples of the
black water

  here and there in the main hall of the
cabin a turned-down lamp glowed yel-
lowly below on the main deck the coals
of a few pine-knot braziers smoldered
waiting to be fanned into flame for the
next landing still glowing from the last
these gave the boat a dimly lighted ex-
istence in the blackness of the river of a
quality mournful beyond words

  there were few landings and for hours
the quiet of the boat was unbroken the
close-lipped poker players in the bar
could not he heard not even the labor
of the engines was audible up here on the
boiler-deck except the faint rattle of
some loose bit of wood a whisper that
told off every fourth beat of the stroke

  here in the silence of the lightless
mississippi arnold huston spent a long
night he dropped into a chair by the
forward rail after a while he had more
than enough to fill his thoughts

   still river

  he was soon to have his own boat it
had been a long time now since he had
stood on the hurricane deck hearing the
harsh carrying drawl of his own com-
mands

  histe up letergo come on with
your freight

  his debt to his dead father if there had
been one was gone with the peter swain
her engines rusted deep in the muck her
charred timbers had gone down with the
river to the all-obliterating salt green of
the sea her bones were scattered
denied the grave that took what was left
of a man purposelessly holding it in one
place yet she had had as much of a
personality as any man one that he was
not likely to forget

  if ever he had anything again it would
be by the labor of his own brain results
given for value received nothing yet
debts seventy-five hundred in paper to
mark wallace in return for a means with

which to pay it back that was the kind
of load he could shoulder though at
heart he had always felt a little defiant
had felt the need of being a little harder
because he had got his start in steam-
boating partly from an inheritance
presumably a dead man has no prefer-
ences but anastasius huston had de-
spised the river while he lived

  still river sweeping down the weary
miles to the sea

  uprooted trees clutched for the mucky
bottom with their limbs became sawyer
snags that fought the current some-
times for years then defeated whirled
on down to the sea with the rest

  meantime his quarrel with the other
branch of the family went on will
huston fruitlessly suing for the hand of
caroline shepherd conceived in his
bafflement that it was arnold who stood
in his way there was a smile in that
but with it there was a threat mark
wallace was none too happy in the
shadow of wills financial enmity

   wills immediate quarrel was based on a
misconception of course it was doubtful
whether his purpose would have changed
had the occasion been removed the
enmity was too deep in the blood always
a brooding spark like a covered brazier
waiting for a breath to bring it into flame

  now another mysterious threat rose a
threat no more clearly defined than the
emptiness of the shadows about walt
gunns cabins what situation lurked
there no one could know-for awhile it
would come out soon a scandal of some
sort that could not be hid perhaps his
very presence there on this night would
involve him inextricably meantime
what should he tell mark nothing
that gunn had not been home

   still river perpetual unhurried taking
its broad bends with a strong swing and
pull

  jacqueline dumoyne the thought of
her was a besieging thing forever seeking
the unguarded moments of his mind as
the vast river defeatable at any point yet
indomitable at all perpetually felt for the
weaknesses in the levees waiting its

chances until no more than a crawfish hole
let a little of the tawny water through
then surging through the widening cre-
vasse sweeping all before it drowning
scouring punishing carrying off on its
flood and when it was diminished in
strength by the very destruction it had
wrought permitting itself to be shut out
again for a little while leaving behind the
receding hungry waters a blank mud plain
of desolation and despair

  it seemed to him that he would be
satisfied never again to touch her hand
never to see her face if only this bitter-
hard work of his this perpetual ebb and
flow of battle for power on the river could
be diverted to her use if she could be
made happy by his labors it seemed to
him that labor for her would be joy
enough

  he was weary a vast labor of prep-
aration of circumvention of numberless
motions in the putting down of obstacles
gained only a minute advantage at the
end of it all-an inch on a road that
stretched ahead a thousand miles yet
it was a labor of emptiness having
no more to do with her than the
labors of a plough-horse in the indiana
fields

  she had made a shell out of him a
meaningless thing going through intri-
cate motions to achieve futile ends it
was as if his whole spirit had gone out of
him to her the empty shell provided the
frontier city with what it had needed it
satisfied the insatiable demands of mac-
maugh it was going to take to the river
in a new boat

  still river

  a man cant stay awake forever

  when he roused himself there was a
silver of frosty dew on the blanket over
his shoulders the twisting river was
running northward now on its right the
sky was mauve violet and white gold
nearer on the left bank of the sweeping
river lay new orleans a west wind took
the long dark pall of the steamboat smoke
to the other shore leaving the city
minutely clear across the mississippi
reaches the low lying buildings were

like flat cut-outs looking bright and
clean pale violet against the dark
western reflection of the dawn

xix

a little after dawn a drenching rain
began to fall in a heavy downpour
at first then slacking off into a steady pelt
that promised to last a week it was the
middle of the morning when huston
delayed by errands in the town at last
reached the frontier city where she lay
on the far side of the river opposite new
orleans she was in the water now and
her engines were in-great iron monsters
twice the size of those she had had before
two steam trials had been almost satis-
factory and macmaugh and his mates
were working on their last revisions

  huston went directly to the boats
office in the forward part of the cabin

  today as he set his hand to the knob
he was given pause by such a hideous
muffled outcry from within as he would
hardly have believed possible in a
haunted house at night let alone in
gray daylight on his busy boat in his
astonishment he took an involuntary
step backward then recovering himself
he thrust into the room

  in the middle of the carpeted floor lay
the lank high-hipped cat stunned evi-
dently for the fluttering vibration of its
ribs showed that it was not dead its
head was such a mass of blood as to have
been unrecognizable had it been seen
alone

  in the best chair sat mark wallace
lounging with that habitual grace of his
that made it seem impossible for him to
take an awkward position he was
smoking with slow relish and contemplat-
ing the ungainly lean body of the bloody
cat he glanced up as huston came in
but did not appear disturbed his sen-
sitive face was quiet composed in his
beautiful dark eyes some strange satis-
faction glowed mistily a keen hidden
pleasure too fine-drawn to be called
sensual too languidly smoldering to be
described in another way
old father of waters



  it was the expression huston had seen
fleetingly at the close of that fiasco of a
duel in the moment after will huston
had fallen it brought back the scene to
him sharply so that he could almost see
the awkwardly sprawling figure face
down in the dirt under those brooding
trees

  what the devil have you been doin
to that cat

  wallaces answer indifferently tossed
off

  amusing myself kick the thing out
into the hall

  huston opened his mouth to speak
but found that he had nothing to say
he took the animal up by the skin of its
back and handed it to a mulatto cabin-
boy in the hall

  wash that things head he ordered
thrusting the bleeding creature at the
man so savagely that the negro started
back

   sometimes huston said to mark as
he closed the door again i think i dont
know you any better than i know the
garfish under the boat

  cats are worthless said wallace in-
differently i have no liking for cats
is this the sort of thing you get out of
your books

  im in no mood for accepting criticism
of any kind whatsoever from you
wallaces voice was so incongruously
mild that huston glanced at him sharply
the delicate incomprehensible pleasure
had disappeared from wallaces face
leaving his eyes more coldly bleak than
huston had ever seen them a hint of
some sort of danger came into the cold-
drenched air of the cabin

  im here to tell you wallace went
on that you sail tomorrow not satur-
day as you had supposed

  impossible said huston flatly
tomorrows friday that shorts you
only twenty-four hours youll have to
arrange it

  i told you it was impossible huston
repeated

  im not interested in impossibilities
im only telling you what has to be done

if you dont know how to get things ac-
complished that is no fault of mine

  you havent any notion of what youre
talkin about

  i respond to that said wallace his
voice softening almost to a purr by
pointing out that you are rapidly prov-
ing yourself an ignorant fool

  huston was not angry yet only puz-
zled and somewhat condescending to his
friends petulant whim

  just where is the necessity for all this
mark

  quite of your own making since you
found it desirable to brawl with your
cousin over a towheaded girl in mande-
ville you thereby put us in a damned
precarious position i-

  what the devil-

  i mean to say ive spent a very pretty
two or three days preventing about ten
thousand dollars worth of our notes being
called

  but if you prevented it-
momentarily wallace qualified bit-
ing his mustache ive saved our hides
for the present by nothing in the world
but face if we get the boat into the
river and earning something we may still
be able to pull through

  still be able to pull through its as
bad as that is it

  exactly

  a wave of anger swept huston

  then youre a damned sight weaker
manager than you give yourself credit
for he growled the first breath of
opposition finds you s ha kin in your
shoes if that dough-faced cousin of
mine really comes out with somethin i
suppose youll curl up and quit like a
cold-blood

  i think not said mark incisively
im holding up my end against a net-
work of factors that you havent the
background to understand even if i were
interested in explaining it to you satisfy
yourself that you pulled it down around
our heads thats all

  rubbish huston retorted dyou
want me to come up and run your end of
it too

        r


alan lemay

  i think youd better learn your own
end first it seems to me my friend
that ive supplied nothing less than every-
thing this enterprise has had put into it
so far the first call on you for anything
but the most mediocre effort has come
now twenty-four hours time looks a
good deal like the line between success or
failure you sit there mouthing im-
possible 

  huston was furious but he held him-
self in check

  now you just make up your mind
to pull yourself together he told mark
harshly im not interested in your
yellow streaks the installation plans
are not goin to be changed they couldnt
be even if your silly notions were correct
meantime i have work to do the boat
leaves for vicksburg saturday

  whether she leaves before then or not
she certainly is not going to move
saturday

  what do you mean

  theres a bankruptcy petition in the
offing my friend

  were no more bankrupt than-
certainly not wallace interrupted
bitingly that has nothing to do with
the situation it is a mere excuse upon
which to base an injunction which will
prevent the frontier city from leaving
her slip

  if the petition is baseless youd better
concern yourself in whipping it and
not-

  you cant very well down the thing
before it comes up if i hadnt had un-
derground wires out i wouldnt know
about it at all their play is to delay
and delay whittling us down until theyre
ready then theyll break us like squeezing
an egg

  who the hell is they

  will hustons crowd their in-
junction will be timed to the hour theres
such a thing as owning judges you know
as well as boats at best it would take
perhaps a week to lift at worst itll
drag on and on until they get something
else to hold us with they know to the
rivet how far youve got with the re-

modeling of the frontier city evidently
they know you too they rest in confi-
dence he closed with cold sarcasm
that nothing is likely to induce you to
make a quick move

  hustons lean cheek bones were
scarlet

  why didnt you say so in the first
place he exploded youre goin to go
too far with me mark

  there was a silence in which they sat
looking at each other outside the
silver-gray rain pattered ceaselessly on
the deck it fell upon the river in a
steep unvarying slant with a steady wet
whispering that lay as an impalpable
background for all other sounds mark
relaxed into a smile his smile always
had a suggestion of the beautiful in it
the subtly sensitive muscles of his face
seeming capable of no other kind re-
gardless of the meaning behind the
expression

  theres no need for us to quarrel he
said gently enough if we are going to
fail were going to fail and we may as
well take it smiling

  were not goin to fail said huston
but there was such an absence of con-
viction in his voice that wallace glanced
at him sharply the gray weariness had
returned to hustons face with the passing
of his anger his eyes were heavy and
cold

  our success or failure mark wallace
said will depend on your activity or
rather upon us both equally

  thats a new idea to you i take it
huston commented dryly a minute
ago you said-

  i spoke in haste mark conceded
ive been under a very considerable
strain arnold its up to me to ac-
complish certain difficult things and its
up to you to get our boat into the water
weve got to pull together arn and pull
damned hard

  huston saw no need for an answer to
this he sat relaxed staring glumly out
into the gray rain

  you havent told me mark sug-
gested when the boat will move
old father of waters



  friday said arnold dully the
shadow of a smile widened his mouth
every nigger on the boat will jump over
the side

  oh i dont think so

  the extra work will cost more you
know

  i see that we cant avoid that

  they seemed to be on their old footing
again arnold harsh-tongued himself
was not inclined to remember the bitter-
ness that had risen between them a few
minutes before

  am said wallace itll be a relief
to us both and to you especially i
know when this boat leaves the levee
the worst of this will soon be over old
man-far as youre concerned i know
youve worked yourself plumb to hell and
back again but-

  im not tired

  yes you are youre as near under as
i ever saw you except that time after the
burning of the peter swain it shows in
every muscle youve got i know youve
worried a good deal about the steam-
boat but-

  hell mark do you think im so poor
at my job that a few details in gettin a
boat ready can put me under

  wallace said directly-

  whats worrying you am

  huston decided not to answer that
he stared off into the slanting shimmer of
the rain and half-smiled as he saw
through mark wallaces questionings
his friend seemed to him singularly
shallow that his apparent concern should
be so transparent he saw that mark
regarded him merely as a factor in certain
plans of his own if some hidden thing
were worrying huston it was to wal-
laces interest to find it out or at least to
ascertain its nature huston wondered
what underground machination mark
suspected him of it was stupid of
wallace he thought to try to draw con-
fidences on the heels of their quarrel

  his face sobered he sat contemplating
his own desolate plight as distantly as if
mark wallace had been ten miles away
and thus while it was still in his mind

that wallace was a stupid questioner
mark trapped him

  i saw jacqueline dumoyne today
mark said

  i wish to christ huston burst out
that youd never taken me there

  a swift chuckle light and amused
brought huston to earth

   so thats all it is

  what dyou mean

  i thought maybe you had got your-
self twisted into some underground ranny-
kazoo with walt gunn for instance
wallace was watching hustons face

  yes arnolds tone was cold and
level

   its really a relief to me mark went
on lightly to know that this spectacle is
only the result of your falling in love
huston passed over this spectacle as
he had passed over the reference to walt
gunn

  you dont seem surprized he said
evenly

  she told me mark said that she
thought you were falling in love with her
huston stirred wallace was going on
she wanted to know what to do i told
her to let you-it would do you good
in what way huston asked in a
muffled voice

  i told her i thought it would take
some of the damned stiffness out of your
neck to come a good sound cropper

  i thought- huston began in the
room before his eyes there was a shimmer
like that of the outer rain but he steadied
himself and let his lids droop i thought
-i had the idea that you had some in-
terest in that quarter yourself

  in your affairs an entertained
spectator my child

  in hers huston corrected him
  indeed

  i mean i thought you had plans of
your own with a flash of diplomacy he
added since you have not of course
that frees my hands

  it happens that i do have plans of my
own

   yet you suggested to her that she lead
me on 


alan lemay

  say rather i advised her that it was
hardly worth while to discourage you in
the early stages

  you give me a carte blanche then as
far as youre concerned

  huston believed that his anger was
now so under control that he could meet
wallaces eyes without revealing it
something akin to a cold shudder ran
over him as he did so he saw the same
quiet face the same sultry smolder of
amusement in the dark eyes with which
mark had gazed at that ghastly cat

  i dont see that it is my place to give
or withold carte blanche on anything
mark said

  i think huston told him that your
detachment is the best compliment you
could pay me he was feeling a keen
revulsion for this odd man with the fine
eyes and the beautiful smile

  dont deceive yourself said mark
youll never go farther with this than i
t hink useful to my interests

  if youre speaking of your priority
rights said huston angrily in spite of
himself i say theres no consideration
cornin to you

  i think youll not find me asking for
anything

  you think its impossible said hus-
ton his voice quivering with suppressed
fury that you should lose out

  not at all

  then you mean-

  i mean that if ever i find you in my
way ill break you with no more com-
punction than i would any one else
you think you could do you
recall my friend that you were a
pauper when i picked you up youll be
a pauper again when i say the word
everything that you have is by my
sufferance i had purpose in view when i
gave you your chance the fact that i
was a fool to pick you with your silly row
on with your bastard brother is beside
the point youre part owner of a steam-
boat-if you dont lose the steamboat-as
long as i say you are when i choose
otherwise youll be seventy-five hundred

in my debt by your note of hand and
owner of nothing

  the contract prevents that i think
read it again mark wallace rose
and began drawing on his gloves youd
better be getting at your work

  into huston had welled such a blind
tumult of fury that he scarcely knew
what he did or said he felt himself
slowly rise from his chair his muscles taut
springs

  mark took a step backward but the
wall was there then the fingers of
hustons left hand twisted themselves
into the pleated throat of his shirt and he
was jammed against the bulkhead wal-
laces face went white there was the
tinge of terror in the shock of his fury as
he found his voice

  this is preposterous what is the
meaning of this

  still the gleaming smile on hustons
face the slow twist of his fingers in
the neckband of the shirt wallaces
face began to darken with the tightening
check of the blood he became dizzy
and a wild panic swept into him

  he screamed-

  let go you fool

  his knuckles flailed in a sudden des-
perate struggle but hustons hand was
like steel even as his eyes darkened
and the terror of futility crushed him his
mind was at work he stopped strug-
gling and though he sagged as if he
would fall he looked directly into hus-
tons mad eyes he heard huston say-
you poor cowardly fool youll never
be master of any situation that i happen
to be in

  then he saw the madness in hustons
eyes give way to a gleam of triumph and
a certain ironic amusement the fingers
slackened at his throat so that he could
get his breath again

  youll fight me for this

  huston laughed in his face

  no im tired of fightin cowards
that irresistible hand flung wallace
staggering toward the door

  get out stay out ive work to do

to be continued

  before he had touched his forehead to

set a course due west and the worshipping

f r buckley tells of a hard-bitted
sheriff of the old west

jaachiavelli rg-leg

i dont know
how it can have
come to pass
but actually there
seems to have
sprung up a super-
stition to the effect
that i william gar-
field sheriff and sole
maintainer of the
peace in three pines
county am a per-
son of violent and
bellicose habits

 the average
stranger surveying
me at my height of
five feet six and at
my ageof seventy-eight may well saynot
really but i assure him that such is
the fact noticing my peg-leg my whisk-
ers my general store and my general ex-
pression of benevolence the said stranger
may be excused for adding it dont
seem possible or words to that effect
yet i beg to reiterate that it is not only
possible but true just because in the
course of my legal duties i have occasion-
ally needed to deal firmly with firm-
dealing jaspers younger and larger than
myself and because i have endeavored
to keep order among the cowpunchers who
come to eat fruit at my international
emporium and sheriffs office on satur-
day afternoons the local population has
got the idea that my only pleasure in life
lies in ramming peoples heads against
rocks shooting them through the maz-
zard or fracturing their wrists with my
octagonal-knobbed stove-poker

 whereas as a
matter of fact noth-
ing could be farther
from the truth
when rash young
lads start to be
rough with a poor
old man like me
naturally i have to
try to be rough in
return and its pos-
sible that i succeed
pretty good but
when left to myself
and not interfered
with in any way no-
body is milder nor
more addicted to
the ways of peace than i am it is no
exaggeration to say i would sooner sue a
guy than shoot him and if i dont like a
jasper i would much rather deal with him
by word of mouth than by bullet of
revolver the former hurts more

  but as a general instance of my pref-
erence for peaceful tactics i will now re-
count the story of eric wilson and his
friend joe scott

 these two boys as no doubt many
local readers will remember turned up in
company to take jobs at the lazy f
ranch which jobs they had secured by
writing from laredo when the triangle
bar- which had formerly employed them
was absorbed into the combine they
were bosom friends and they arrived so
late at night that it was no use their
trying to make the lazy f before morn-
ing so i told them that if they didnt
mind and had fifty cents between them
machiavelli peg-leg



they could share the bed i usually keep for
corpses and have breakfast with me for
another quarter each

  its very kind of you to invite us to
stay mr garfield says mr wilson
who was a handsome guy in a blue silk
neckcloth

  its refreshing to find an example of
the old texan hospitality still surviving
in these days of commercialism the
only thing that occurs to me is this-that

i	never sleep well when im not alone i
dont know why-its funny i suppose i
have a very sensitive nervous system-

  well he had a charming smile and
nice teeth also and nobody as you can
see for yourself could have been more
affable if as but nevertheless his jaw-
hinges had been too well oiled for my
liking and i was just going to remark
that he could sleep in the corral if he
insisted on so doing when joe scott
broke in

  sure ek says he this evidently
being erics pet name i can fix myself
up a shake-down on the floor

  its a hard floor says i

  joe scott didnt say anything silence
seemed to be rather his long suit-
silence and self-sacrifice

  there are nails in it i continued
and the allowance of blankets is
limited

  still he said nothing and so eventually
he had his way after an evening spent by
eric wilson in fascinating discourse and
by scott and me in a more or less de-
pressed silence i figure i was more de-
pressed than scott was because occasion-
ally i like to chat a little myself whereas
this young man seemed perfectly content
to sit and listen to the conversation of his
gifted side-kicker he sat in a dark
comer and smoked cigarets and drank
in eric wilsons flowing periods like he
was listening to the prophet isaiah

  of course says the golden-tongued
boy orator when he had dealt with the
free silver tariff negro voting pro-
hibition immigration and free range
questions and when at last the clock
marked  p m a man of your age mr

 garfield taking you as a relic left over
 from a past generation-

   -wants to go to bed says i rudely
 and went there

   i lay awake long enough to hear wil-
 son catch his spurs in scotts carefully-
 arranged shake-down and scatter it all
 over the floor to his curses about which
 scott replied

   sall right ek sorry dont mat-
ter ill make it up again

   and then i fell asleep

   thats all i have to say in introduction
 of these two young men except more to
 the same effect viz that when i came
 down next morning to earn my twenty-
 five cents by providing their breakfasts
 i found that joe scott had already cooked
 ek wilsons and mine and was just
 about to start cooking his own

   also that when the boys departure
for the lazy f put an end to wilsons
discourse on the best methods of bull-
breeding i went out to the kitchen only
to find that scott had employed the odd
quarter of an hour in washing the dishes

ii

  and as things had started so they
continued-which is a habit they
have unless there is somebody about
who knows how the course of events
should run and is capable of keeping cir-
cumstances in their proper channel by
brute force i am such a somebody but
when i say brute force i dont mean
anything to do with peg-legs or revolvers
or similar coarse tools you will see
what i do mean in a minute but in the
meantime let me state that both eric
wilson and joe scott fell heavily and im-
mediately in love with the daughter of old
colonel sanderson of the bar t outfit
and that wilson ere a week was out
appeared to be winning in a walk

  and why not i ask you wasnt he
designed by nature to be the idol not
 only of all the available ladies but also of
ninety-nine per cent of the males who
might have been expected to know
better v wasnt his hair curly and


f r buckley

couldnt he make his eyes flash and
didnt he always have scott along to
deputize on any work yea verily

  yes says poor joe scott when he
came over one day and i mentioned his
pal to him a muslin sack of the usual
please hes one of fortunes favorites all
right mr garfield suppose you and
me had been born like that eh

  lets dont i begged having just
had my lunch how is he gettin on
with mabel

  mr scott smiled bravely but there
was a wrinkle about half an inch above his
left eyebrow this gave me my first
idea that his heart was after all stronger
than his hallucinations

  fine says he of course mabel
herself aint in the matter so much yet
awhile

  no i asked with some surprize
no says joe scott sighing and star-
ing at a mineral-water calendar no
shes such a soft little wind-flower of the
prairie mr garfield that us rough men
that would make her our own must-
us i inquired

  him i mean stutters scott what
i mean-er-

  yeah says i what you mean is
that wilsons butterin the old man up
before he starts on the girl but what id
like to know is how hes workin the
hypnosis on a gruff-voiced parade-rasp-
ing old martinet like that

  oh says scott wilson gets on fine
you know ek was in the army during
the war

  what regiment

  i dont know says scott hes so
modest but i dont think he was in an
ordinary regiment at all i think he had
some very important detached duty-
something way up

  fifteenth floor of the remount depot
most like i suggested how about
yourself

  oh i was just a doughboy an not a
very good one at that

  how so

  oh well i was back in the base hos-
pital about half my time if there was a

machine-gun nest within a mile id go an
blunder into it an-

  how about the machine-gunners i
asked

  oh well- says scott regretfully

  so we had a moment of silence for the
heroic dead and would have had an-
other for scotts congressional medal of
honor if id known about it and then i
said-

  so you dont seem to cut much ice
with old sanderson eh

  the boy started up as if id stuck a pin
into him

  me oh no i never try to he
protested you seen for yourself what a
fascinating guy wilson is-

  meeting my gaze he swallowed some-
thing

  im-er-im thinkin of leaving these
parts pretty soon mr garfield says
he you know what i mean wilsons
the only guy thats ever taken much
notice of me-im kind of a dumb ox
an now hes gettin kind of occupied
with the colonel an ma-miss sander-
son-

  dont you boys go over to the bar t
together

  oh yeah but-

  but the conversation dont seem to
include you

 no not much you see i got
nothin to say

  sit alone by yourself all evenin
miss mabel generally brings her sew-
ing an sits near me says scott evinc-
ing a desire to bury his head in his hands
but i dunno what to say to her either
beyond that its a fine night which it
generally aint i kind of cant help
listenin to wilson-he talks like a book
you know mr garfield so interestin
the colonel thinks hes the most intel-
ligentest man that ever trod the soil of
texas and so he is

  son-in-law then says i

  poor scott failed to suppress a violent
shudder

  well i dont know says he his eyes
filming over and his voice appearing to
issue from a throat partly obstructed by a
machiavelli peg-leg



large green-gage thats a pretty big
order mr garfield when its the sweet-
est little woman in gods country the
fairest-

  yeah says i hastily getting him out
of his trance with a prod in the ribs
yeah-when all thats at stake what
next

  well its a big order says scott
lamely wilson aint said anythin yet
-even to me-but his eyes have spoken
for him

  my lord i demanded aint there
no part of that man that dont talk
but the colonel says joe miserably
aint goin to leggo his desert rose to the
first comer intelligence may be all
right but he wants more hes a-selectin
her mate with care with lovin-

  does wilson ever show any interest
in the colonels health i demanded
suddenly

  scott came out of another trance
n-no says he just goes up and
takes him by the hand an tells him he
looks not more than forty-five

  why dont you do similar i asked
its no use actin as if you werent in
love with mabel because you are and
take your forehead off my cash-register
youre perspiring with agony an youll
rust it

  how could i tell the old guy such
lies demanded scott without obeying
my last injunction he looks more like
ninety to me i aint got no social sense-
never had never will have

  but what if i was to promise you that
youd be mabels mate as you call it i
inquired an not wilson
wha-a-a-a-t gasps scott recovering
miraculously with eyes that shone like
newly-polished door-knobs he stood in
ecstasy for a moment and then he looked
at me and what do you think he said
even he had heard this slander about
my violence and he spoke of the same
i nearly chucked his case up on the spot

  look here says he i cant have
any injuries done to my pal mr gar-
field no framing him up with a felony
and knocking the daylights out of him

  why- i broke in indignantly

  i mean no dropping of hams on his
head out of the rafters or stunning him
with a chair or making him fall down
cellar stairs or fire a double-barreled ten-
gage duck-gun at himself says scott
alluding to several episodes which nobody
regrets more than i do

  get out of here says i resolving to
be patient and demonstrate to the boy his
error in estimating my character good
afternoon

ill

well of course he was careful to tell
me before leaving that i must be
out of my mind and then during the
whole of the next week he added insult
to injury by riding over every day to
recount the amazing progress wilson was
making in old colonel sandersons es-
teem

  the best mans winning like i told
you he would says mr scott on about
his fifth visit and in a triumphant man-
ner slightly marred by the audible break-
ing of his heart i told you you were
talking through your hat mr garfield
yeah says i biting off an end of
thread and continuing to patch my pants
but you didnt mention that you had
four certificates from the humane so-
ciety did you now

  dont try to change the subject says
mr scott blushing id like you to
apologize for saying that miss sanderson
could possibly be mixed up matrimonially
with a man of my caliber no doubt you
were under the influence of drink at the
time and i am not disposed to be
severe-

nor me i told him get out now
of course says the poor goof hope-
fully but going toward the door neverthe-
less if you had any real good reasons for
making such a statement-

  good afternoon says i and if
anybodys going to commit suicide on
me it had better be the girls almost-
fiance

  if i bring him over says scott i
dont know what will happen


f r buckley

  bring him and see says i good
afternoon

  so he brought him but not to demand
explanations-merely to ask if as i had
alleged i could supply diamond solitaire
engagement-rings cheaper than the great
new york jewelry firms of course i
cant but  had alleged it am i not
writing this narrative to show theres
more to me than mere muscular agility
and quickness on the draw

  i didnt think i told wilson while
exhibiting a catalog sent me in 
that matters had got quite to the ring
stage yet

  well to be quite truthful says the
handsome young man delicately licking
his finger and turning to the four-carat
section i have not yet thought it ad-
visable to put the question to the young
lady herself mr garfield possibly you
are not acquainted with the method in
vogue among families of aristocratic
european extraction in the arrangement
of these things-especially where as in
this case a large quantity of land and
similar real property at present entailed
upon the heirs-male-

  the method consists in soft-soaping
the male ancestor huh says i

  well certainly the favorable-
and sanderson isnt quite ready to
slip yet aint he

  i shouldnt exactly put it in that
manner but-

  thats what you mean aint it
well listen you understand that theres
a bit of profit on these diamond rings
my dear mr garfield- begins the
expansive young gentleman waving one
hand in the air

  well id like to sell you one as quick
as may be i informed him brutally
though seeing in his eye that hed decided
to go to laredo for the token where-
fore i tell you this your sidekicker says
that never in the whole course of your
going to the lazy f have you asked the
colonel how he felt in himself like or
gone into the question of his inflammatory
rheumatism

  rheumatism

  hes a martyr to it its a regular
hobby of his hes always gettin doc
brewer over an experimentin on him-
self with patent medicines he spends
hours and hours dosin himself an hed
like to spend hours and hours more
talkin about how it feels and what hes
doin for it but he dont dare any more
on account of everybody leavin the mo-
ment he starts on his symptoms havent
you noticed the way he drags his left
leg after him

  yes but i assumed-

  hes trawling for inquiries says i
winking an the man who would go
an ask him how it was an not be put off
by him sayin he never had such a thing
-of course hes gun-shy these days the
man whod go ahead and draw him out
on the subject would make a hit i say
no more

  youve said enough says wilson
grabbing hold of my hand and shaking it
i certainly will come to you for that
ring you know how it is mr garfield-
a man may be all thats desirable and
yet not have that key-that little human
passport to the heart of the person-
yeah says i well you try
that good day

  orryvwaw replies wilson in fluent
french come on scott god bless
you mr garfield

  so they went

  i should like just here to remark that
while before now i have had to shoot
horses and drown dogs and have seen
their eyes fixed upon me during the pro-
cesses-never have i seen such a gaze as
was handed forth by j scott as he fol-
lowed his friend through the door

iv

but how changed he was when next
i saw him-mr scott i mean

  if you will believe me he came vaulting
on to my verandah over the railing and
having entered the store he positively
swaggered up to the counter and
slapped me on the back

  well says he
machiavelli peg-leg



  well indeed i answered swallowing
my butt all the way down before it could
burn me well what

  shes going to marry me-e-e-e
chants mr scott doing a few steps of the
charleston on my floor we were sit-
ting together as usual neither of us saying
a word and she sewing-you know last
night after wed been over here to see
you tra-la-la-lai-tu and wilson was
talking to the old man thick as thieves
all of a sudden he said something wilson
did and the old colonel bobbed up out of
his chair and said-well never mind
what he said tra-la something about
wilsons impudence so wilson said
something else and the colonel got to be
quite a bright purple color and roared
out go and read the history of your
country you young puppy go and
read the history of your native land
tra-la-la so wilson said something
else and the colonel reached for a gun
tiddley-push ooooo merrily goes the
time when the hea-a-a-rt is young
tra-la-

  and then i asked merely exhibiting
the stove-poker

  so i was going to rush between them
says mr scott when of a sudden i felt
two soft sweet rounded arms about my
neck mr garfield and i heard rose-
petal lips whispering in my ear let him
drill a hole in the nasty tango-lizard if he
feels like it joey you stay right here
with me 

  mm says i marveling at the vocab-
ulary nice girls have these days and
so-

  and so i stayed says mr scott
tra-la-la-lai-tu

  yodeling is all very well i remarked
sternly but a few scattered thanks
would be better

  thanks demanded scott breaking
off amid a call to the summit of mont
blanc and regarding me strangely

  i wont insist on an apology for the
way you suspected me of violence

i said but gratitude i should and will
have

  gratitude gasps the affianced gent
when only the other day-yesterday
by gosh-you were tellin wilson how to
cold-cream the colonel-

  by asking him about his rheumatism
says i

  yeah

  the said colonel having been during
the late war-i mean the civil war
says i meaningly and slowly a colonel
in the recruiting commissariat or graves
registration departments i dunno
which but anyhow he spent a very
pleasant war in chicago illinois and
bought the lazy f with the proceeds
oh says mr scott less melodiously
it is indeed rheumatism not to say
gout which causes him to limp so pathet-
ically says i but it is quite a passion of
his to have the credit given to some
ghastly gash gained in the service of his
country and since he owns most of the
land and banks and things hereabouts
everybody but your friend wilson has
hitherto let it go at that

  oh says mr scott again and re-
garded me with considerable admiration
and they told me when i first came
here that you were a-

  they were wrong says i reaching
under the counter for a catalog that had
come in that mornings mail i am a
sheriff to be sure and can act as such
when required but i am also a station-
master postmaster commissioner of
deeds registrar of vital statistics and-
most especially-the proprietor of this
here international emporium

  i spread out the catalog to its best ad-
vantage and fixed scott with my glittering
eye

  now that you have ceased to identify
me exclusively with battle murder sud-
den death and similar necessary but un-
profitable things i suggested how
about letting me take your order for a
nice diamond solitaire ring
the mystery of the korin screen

the
thunder god

westgaard leaned back in his
office-chair his head against the
framed photograph of some enor-
mous states factory his eyes half closed
seemed interested only in watching the
gray smoke of his cigaret turn to blue
where it floated into sunlight

  he listened to the squeal of ill-adjusted
brakes on the wet street below the offices
of the asiatic-import and then said gently
that it was surprizing how slowly osakas
streets dried after a shower

  i cant accustom myself to machines
in japan he added but i suppose you
do a nice business in them bill it will be
a long time before they come to my own
province he stretched his legs ive
never driven one he went on slowly
i dont believe that i could its hard
enough- smiling-for me to sit in a
chair all i can do to keep from squattin
on the floor

  carstairs osaka manager of the a-i
listened carefully saw nothing to answer
and worse nothing to the point so he
repeated his original sentence only no
longer as an interrogation

  you couldnt go for us he said

  westgaards eyes hazy blue-gray like
the smoke did not flicker

  i havent said a word-yet-about
going or not going in only trying to
tell you to come clean bill he bal-
anced himself more precariously youre
gettin like your office bill youve got
a filin-case mind you tell me some-
thing just as youd write it on an order
blank

  the other man tried to find a way to
meet westgaards preoccupied eyes and
after a pause said swiftly

  ive told you all i know andy all
every word my orders came from the
old man himself he said send west-
gaard i know it sounds like a fool
business i suppose it is foolish and
yet the boss insisted-

  you might have told him that this is
silk-buyin season up my way bill and
you might have added that im no curio
hunter

  i didnt tell him-

  no you didnt tell him anything bill
thats why youre a manager here old
bill the dried-out westgaard did not
move but added solemnly after all i
know im a sort of special ambassador
for the a-i but i ought to be allowed a
little choice you just tell the boss im
not interested in fancy screens and let it
go at that or ill write him myself
tell him one of the kidsll get it for
him

  carstairs fumbled with his watch-fob
his placid face-westgaard had more
wrinkles about his eyes than the other
had in his entire countenance-showed
actual distress

  i dont believe i dare he admitted
finally the old man said you he
seemed to have some special reason for
sending you or he wouldnt have had you
come all the way from your district he
probably knows more than i do about
it

  westgaard shrugged
a complete novelette

by

sidney herschel small

  probly does he rocked the chair
to the floor and stood up if he wants
curios tell him to go get em hanged if
ill dry-nurse any screen from some dingy
temple to become the ornament in some
womans what-dye-callem thats that
bill shikata ga nai-cant be helped

  carstairs did not attempt to argue
westgaard was one of the a-i pioneers
never before had the north-province man
reftieed anything carstairs told the
other that he didnt blame him that it
would be arranged differently somehow

  i dont mind doing it westgaard
retorted but its a fools errand bill
if the old man thinks im gettin old-
maskee if i do this next week hell want
me to buy a pair of embroidered night-

gowns for some tourist he knows-and i
will not buy nightgowns

  he went to the window and opened it
smells good after a little rain he
continued soberly

  carstairs realized that this was the
end of the old mans orders he began to
wonder if he should send some one else
after the screen or wire the head of the
a-i for instructions his orderly mind
began to plan the letter

  the others calm voice came to him-
funny how osakas changed since
we came to the orient cant get used to
it hasnt chanced any when you get
away from the cities though when i
look down and see uniformed messenger-
boys and trams and machines and bikes


sidneyherschel small

when i know that in this building therere
desks and adding-machines and tele-
phones its hard to remember that the
nishi hongwanji is just around the cor-
ner with its dogs of fo and dragons and
lanterns and gods and  bronze bells-
all a sign im gettin old bill mere fact

i	talk so much proves it an old-timer
buyin silk underwear embroidered with
iris step-ins camisoles sent by the
boss after a corset-i know it was a
screen but it might just as well have
been the other-and-

   the word hung in the air

  westgaard stood stock-still at the
window his eyes suddenly wide and
bright before carstairs could cry out
even once he was back in his chair

  tell me more of this business of
screens he demanded sharply

   carstairs gasped pointing

  it hit the ceiling andy you can see
the hole you were standing right in the
light whoever shot knew who you were
whoever-

   the screen bill

  carstairs could not maintain even a
semblance of calm

  it came all the way from across the
street he shouted although he did not
go to the window from either the
third or fourth floor im going to call
the police shot at you andy no
question of it couldnt have missed by
more than an inch

  six good shot from that distance
worst thing i ever heard of osaka
isnt a frontier town ill-

  westgaard placed a lean hand over the
telephone

  dont he said rapidly you want
me to go after the-underwear i may
now all depends forget the shot
bill and give me a line on the screen
the osaka manager was unable to take
his eyes from the window the opposite
building

   if id been watching i could have seen
who shot at you he said at last it
came through the window at an angle
it must have been fired from that vacant
third floor it was just leased to a

british steamship crowd and they
havent taken possession yet the-the
police ought to be informed andy i
wouldnt wander if some one in the street
heard the shot and reported it why
should any one want to pot you any-
how

  westgaards hazy eyes brightened until
they were as shining as the clear sky

  nobody wanted to-until today he
admitted in a crisp voice no use
talkin about it but this screen whats
it worth who knows were after it
who elses after it

  carstairs pulled his eyes from window
to bullet-hole

  thiss a concrete building he said
shakily the bullets stuck in the ceil-
ing i-this things upset me

  get on with the screen

   the other shook his head almost bellig-
erently as he said

  youre used to excitement andy
youre all head and no nerves its just
come to me that perhaps the shot was
meant for me

  youre fair and im dark youre fat
and im thin besides- smiling-the
sun reflects off that bald dome of yours
like it would off brass no dont worry
whoever did the shootin knew who he
was aimin at now tell me about the
screen westgaards level voice sobered
calmed the other

 tts supposed to be akorin made
a about  a few years before the
artist died thats what they say at the
museum i had some one ask it is
made in six sections you cant miss it
he paused and then said give me a
cigaret andy im sweating all over
if you didnt follow orders so closely
bill you could take a drink out of a
bottle in your desk you need one its
a screen in six parts just like a hundred
thousand others is that all you know
carstairs smiled faintly

  i-im going out and have one direct-
ly we finish he told westgaard but
the screen-its painted with pictures of
the wind god and the thunder god there
the thunder god



are supposed to be two empty panels
the hair of the thunder gods done in
gold hes holding a round pole with
nine thunderbolts attached to it hes
almost naked except for some sort of
kilts the wind gods got a regular pig-
snout and then theres korins sig-
nature of course anyhow ive got a
sketch of the thing youd better take it
along

  westgaard studied the drawing of the
screen

  how muchs it worth

 nobody knows an inferior one
brought fifty thousand yen

  westgaards eyes narrowed

  where is it

  up above denshaiko-the hot spring
country been in the temple ever since
the artist korin died temples broke
the old man wrote thats why theyre
selling just buy it and bring it back
the priests are ready to sell nothing
new about that every temple parts with
its treasures when the priests are hungry
and this has been a hard season up den-
shaiko way

  never heard of this screen before
bill i was in the denshaiko temple
once too but-

  it was kept in the house of some rich
priest i understand and has only re-
cently been kept in the temple or i
might be mistaken it may still be in the
priests house not that it matters so
long as you get it ive got the money for
you in thousand-yen notes whoevers
selling knows what its worth

  i suppose you kept the old mans
letter in your desk

  it came marked confidential and i
didnt suppose he wanted every one in the
office to know about it

 just wanted to know westgaard
crossed the office and examined the lock
of the desk i could open it with a
buttonhook he said my boy-hes
along with me bill and hes a slick
kid picked him up in my district-my
boy could pick that lock with a tooth-
pick oh well theres probly no con-
nection between the screen and the pot-

shot just some enthusiast practisin
by the way is any one else after the
screen

  not that i know about i think the
old man was informed that it was to be
sold that information isnt general
well westgaard said it seems as if
some one knows somebody who doesnt
like the ketojin who do we buy the
thing for

 i dont know im to send it to
tokyo when you bring it

  you mean when i get it you mean-
whats the matter with you now
carstairs had slipped low in his chair
he waved a hand to indicate that he want-
ed to talk but when words issued they
were almost in a whisper

  the old man wrote that you were to
go armed andy armed his chin
trembled id forgotten all about that
you know how the boss is gives more
advice than you can remember just to
fill out the page but now that youve
been shot at-

  westgaard reached out a hand

  let me see the letter he asked

  various trusted employees of this company
  are forced to carry large sums of currency and
  it should be impressed upon them that it is
  necessary that they be in possession of a large
  caliber revolver of reputable make a blanket
  permit has been secured for them by this office
  you are to impress this upon all such employees
  in your territory

  for a moment he read silently he
grinned almost at once and then began to
laugh loudly

  and thats the old man he said
gleefully he copied that darned para-
graph from his dictation-to-field-men
notebook and you and i worried about
it hes probly got a new stenographer
and she didnt have sense enough to omit
it from a letter about me goin after
camisoles with a gun bill dont ever
tell the story on me

  youre talking carstairs told him
thoughtfully you fooled me once with
a lot of words i know what youre
about when youre silent but when you

   hairy foreigners


sidney herschel small

start to talk too much theres something
up this time its that shot

  didnt know i gave myself away
westgaard retorted anyhow youre
wrong im just glad to have a white man
to talk to none in my district except a
few missionairies forget the shot it
isnt important now i remember a man
up shimonoseki way who-

  carstairs smiled a little then since
westgaard did not continue he said very
quietly

  remember that youre big youre
easy to hit andy a fellow who only
misses by inches when hes shooting clear
across a street wont miss when hes any
closer he swallowed and looked at
the angular westgaard nervously be-
be careful andy he ended

  the north-province man found that
somehow his hand and carstairs were
joined in tight clasp curious emotion
touched him and he found it difficult to
avoid saying that it had been many years
since any one had thought of his welfare
what he did say was this-

  ill have a try for the screen and keep
my eyes open while im at it

  as he opened the door and the noise
of the outer office made it necessary to
raise his voice he added very loudly
im on my way ill take the night
train from umeda station

  carstairs frowned and indicated that
the door was open his eyes raising to
westgaards lighted with sudden under-
standing

  sooner you get started the better
he agreed vociferously the night train
by all means

  the meeting of the two mens eyes was
as warm as the handclasp had been

ii

westgaard had left his boy and
bags far from either the foreign
quarter or shinsai-bashi-suji osakas prin-
cipal street while he was in the descend-
ing lift from the a-i offices he decided
swiftly that he would not return to his
room but go to the hotel he made no

further admission that the shooting had
set him to thinking that it might have
some bearing on the business in hand

 the day had grown warm in the
streets off shinsai-bashi-suji shopkeepers
had drawn white cloth strips across the
ways to filter the suns rays inter-
mingled with japanese dressed occidental-
fashion were many in kimonos beggars
and minstrels trying to walk in stately
leisure between rickshaws and automo-
biles one in flowing black robes bare-
headed bleated once on a conch-shell
after a machine had brushed against him

  as westgaards rickshaw rattled over a
bridge he saw boys up to their hips in the
river-bed searching for eels the river
was shadowed by a six-story foreign-
style building

  i havent been inside the hotel for ten
years westgaard said when the japa-
nese clerk greeted him by name

  misessgd rmembr inn cross other
side yodogawa

  westgaard said

  thought i remembered your face
and a good inn too thats where my
bags are and my boy send after them
will you and id like a room topside
ill eat there too and- quietly-
im not in the hotel

  you are not here the immaculate
clerk smiled good if not here out of
lobby be good also boy

  from westgaards room high in the
hotel the white man could see the city
cut into many islands round which
swerved the black waters of the yodo-
gawa rafts craft like uncovered sam-
pans steamboats of light draft crowded
the river beyond it hung a fine mist like
heat haze

  he pulled a chair to the window think-
ing that it would take considerable marks-
manship to shoot at him now

  that he had avoided the inn began to
trouble him

  im gettin old-shouldnt have let
fussy old bill scare me he thought a
screen even worth fifty thousand yen
isnt worth murder it might be if some
eta were able to steal it from me but the
the thunder god



beggar couldnt sell it even if he had it
hed land in jail the moment he tried
besides i havent got the screen im
only after it that shooting was
accidental

  the more he considered it the more
accidental it seemed finally relaxed
soothed he decided that good might
come of his half-fright

  ill order me a real dinner ill give
the order to that clerk and hell see i get
good food havent eaten a steak i dont
know when ill tell em to put it in a
hot pan and cook it right if the old
man wants to send me on fools errands
its time i gave him something like an
expense account wonder if i could get
a dry martini thatd be mixed right

  he went to the room telephone

  better write it down he said a
third french vermouth a third italian
vermouth a third gordons dash of
bitters tell em to measure not to
guess and i want it cold got it all
written down well heres another
order im hungry and i know youll
have it cooked right- oh-oh you
think he was eh hes cornin up
what oh anything to eat anything
youve got two portions of everything
martini who said anything about a
martini

  as he hung up the phone westgaard
muttered-

  i should have gone myself

  he went over to his chair by the win-
dow sat down pulled the chair round so
as to face the door and waited the clerk
opened the door but westgaards eyes
went past him to the figure of his boy

   gainst rules ragpickr come up the
clerk said clos teared maketa ni
chigai wa nai there is no mistake about
his having been beaten

  westgaard looked at the ripped kimono
bought for choshimu only a week ago for
the great visit to osaka

  the boy whimpered

  danna-san i was not fighting with
city boys as you warned me danna-san
of the new kimono there is nothing left
but-

  kimonos may be bought anywhere
westgaard said in japanese he turned
to the hotel employee thank you if
any one should ask for me downstairs say
you do not know if i am here that you
just came to work and arrange for some
one to phone up to me keeping whoever
asks waiting

  the clerk nodded

  there was a great excitement when
your boy rushed in he said any one
who knew that he was your boy knows
you are here

  for that reason he goes back with
you westgaard ordered drive him
from the hotel have a porter do it
however explain to him where there is a
side or rear door and see to it that he is
watched as he goes to it and then have
him brought back to me can it be
done

  the clerk bowed

  the lady tourists will be glad to see
him driven out he said from their
words they must have believed that he
was a desperate criminal with his tatters
and bruises for all he is no bigger than a
large flea

flea am not choshimu squeaked
he is your boy and he seems to have
spirit the clerk grinned we can not
blame you for wanting to discover who
beat him it can be done

  alone again westgaard wondered what
had happened to choshimu and why
the boy could and would lie whenever
possible he might have picked a quarrel
with the first osaka boy he met but he
did obey orders and one of these was that
he was not to leave the room of the inn
whoever beat him did it in westgaards
room why

  had the lad been questioned and re-
fusing answer become impertinent to
some inn man-servant the shot the
screen the beating-coincidence that
was what it was no mere painted screen
could cause trouble and yet-

  he looked at his bags and saw that the
strap of one was unfastened had a
curious inn-servant been prying and had
choshimu caught him at it or had


sidney herschel small

thieves slipped in through the inns
windows to the room on the ground floor
and after having tied and gagged choshi-
mu robbed him they must have been
disappointed in their haul

  westgaard pulled the taut strap loose
from its buckle as he pressed the catch
down to open the bag he heard choshimu
call-

  harnasai-can i come in
westgaard bent away from the bag
although his fingers pressed the catch
open and he automatically pulled the top
of the bag apart it came slowly it was
difficult to open as choshimu pushed
against the door westgaard called

  put your hand on the brass round
thing which sticks out from the wood and
turn it then the door will open for you
wooden-head

  as fingers turned the knob and the
door swung westgaard his head away
from the bag pulled more forcibly on the
two sides of the top

  the thunder of a discharged gun drove
him back on his heels

  smoke filled his eyes for a moment his
fist drove out at the advancing figure of
choshimu

 danna-san it was-

  if it was not through the door if some
one had not been simulating choshimus
voice it was the window westgaard
whirled toward it

  before he could even look out choshi-
mu shouted

  the leather box for clothes danna-
san i saw san i saw it did it once
it will do it again i have never believed
in devils but i believe in them now
smoke westgaard saw hovered about
the mouth of the bag he said after he
had looked within-

  thats hat they beat you for 

  it was almost impossible to believe that
a gun could be so rigged up to permit its
discharge blocks of wood held the butt
to the bottom of the bag from the inner
pockets of the valise wires were attached
to the barrel these held the weapon
steady through the trigger-guard was
another piece of wood attached by wires

to two heavy springs opening the bag
exerted pressure upon the springs they
in turn pulled down with uncanny force
upon the trigger

  devils westgaard agreed you
see how it was done infant

  i see now choshimu told him
and i see more than that when-
man and boy faced the door

  when westgaard explained to the
hotel attache that he had been handling
a new revolver and it had discharged
suddenly accidentally and when he
explained further that he had a permit
for possession of a weapon and when the
employee had disappeared with indrawn
breaths of politeness then only did white
man and brown boy relax and become
natural

  an old priest told me that a wise man
knows when to be afraid the urchin
announced gravely

  in the same voice as if speaking to an
equal westgaard said-

  we will remember that

choshimu knelt down and looked under
the bed he went to the window and
peered out

  it makes my belly come to my neck
he stated but so long as that door is
closed we will have no more shootings
and beatings filled with what had
happened he hurried with i know my
kimono cost many sen danna-san and i
thought i was a brave man- he was
twelve- to keep thieves out of your
bags i thought the noise i would make
fighting would call some one in the inn
but some pig-face had his hand over my
mouth i-i tried to fight but i could
do no more than wriggle

  they came into the room through a
window i did not hear them oh there
were more than one i know even if they
had a rag over my eyes and over my
mouth the first one who grabbed me
took a kick in the leg i wished i wore
shoes like yours danna-san but they
were too many for me i think there
were three or-five yes there were
five when these eight men had been
tied they did something i thought they
the thunder god



were robbing you then six more men
had been tied they did something i
thought they were robbing you then
six more men came into the room and
all began beating and kicking me at
once and then- shamefacedly-i
went to sleep under their kicks and knew
nothing until you sent for me
westgaard said

  if you did not lie so much you would
make a good soldier baby and if you did
not fight so much you would make a
good priest we are going to eat as soon
as food can be brought i will buy a riew
kimono

  and it will be tom by no robbers i
will have this devil-shooter and-
guns are not for children

  westgaard took the automatic from
the boy pulled the clip from the metal
stock and saw that three bullets remained

  ill obey instructions for once he
thought and dropped the weapon into his
coat pocket

  when food was brought choshimu ad-
mitted the waiter westgaards hand
was in his pocket until the servant had
brought table and tray the white man
drank both cocktails and then watched
choshimu sample all of the dishes a bite
here another there the boy ate little
from any of the plates

  it has no taste he said finally
besides it is not seemly for me to eat
before you danna-san are you not
hungry

  westgaard shook his head

  not hungry-but you eat empty one
is this not better than rice and fish all
covered with daikkon

  it has no taste choshimu repeated
i like food which can be smelled any-
how besides the food of the white men
does not ride well in my belly

  westgaard had lighted a cigaret and
was looking out at the lights springing up
like rising fireflies along the river he
turned suddenly and caught choshimus
face distorted

  whats wrong he asked

  there is a very small pain in my
belly the boy told him it is nothing

i did not know you saw me aching it
will be better

  the white man poured a glass brimful
of tansan

  drink he said

  when the glass of mineral water was
emptied choshimu was ordered to drink
a second and a third then westgaard
thrust a long finger into the japaneses
scrawny throat it was minutes before
choshimu gasped-

do you want to kill me danna-san
if you had eaten like a pig you would
be dead already westgaard snapped
if i had eaten with you or alone you
would have a new master tonight

  i ate nothing the boy wailed i
only tasted

  be glad of that

  he stared at the scarcely touched dishes
choshimu divined his thought

let us have that bringer-of-food
here danna-san we will slice an inch or so
from his cheeks and learn something
westgaard was certain beyond any
doubting that the food was poisoned

  we will talk to him he agreed and
went to the house telephone

  before the waiter reached the room
westgaard placed a small amount from
each dish on a clean plate

  even before the servant began to eat
the white man knew that he was entirely
innocent no protest was uttered beyond
a formal statement that it was against
the rules and might cost him his job

  as the waiter removed the tray a
second japanese knocked and was admit-
ted he bowed very slightly to west-
gaard and then said

  i am the manager we have waited
for some one to ask to see you but we
did not think of food all i can say is that
a new kitchen-coolie went to work for us
this afternoon shortly after you came-
and that now he is gone

  westgaard observed the hotel man
soberly

  you know whats up he said at last
  the japanese shrugged

  we know that there is a something in
the wind he said a man-a white-


sidney herschel small

man-does not eat alone after being
away from other white men he comes
to the restaurant where he hears his own
language and sees white women be-
sides it is not every day that a shot is
heard in a hotel we said nothing to you
about it but i looked through that
door- indicating one to a connecting
room-is to make certain that you were
not injured there is also a man-
armed-in the next room with orders to
see that you are protected

  he looked squarely at the white man
before continuing

  if you are to stay with us long may
we inform the police we do not want
you to leave it is not that we merely
want protection for you while you are our
guest

  westgaard said

  im leaving before night dont say
anything to any one

  he had intended waiting until morn-
ing now he wanted suddenly to give
whoever was attempting his life an op-
portunity to act again to act more open-
ly shots in the dark and poison admit-
ted no counter-action

  he said-

  you dont know who the kitchen-
coolie was

  he came-he was hired now he is
gone we do not know

  choshimu wriggled uneasily

  he was one of the men the twenty-
six men who this afternoon-

  westgaard said-

  be still baby to the hotel man he
bowed i am grateful to you we want
to get to umeda station for the night
train north but-

  you will have my own car the other
said instantly and i myself will drive
you to the station

  that makes it very simple west-
gaard smiled will you have tickets to
shibata bought first class as far as
possible

  i will telephone some friend of mine
to buy them and he will meet us at the
station that is better than having the
order come through the hotel if you

have room will you take food with you
it will be carefully prepared

  westgaard thanked him

  you must be wondering what thiss
all about

  the manager spread out his hands

  i have been in hotels too many years
to be astonished at anything he held
out his hand good luck mr west-
gaard and be careful

  ive been told that twice today

   man speaks once repetition comes
from the gods  the other quoted in
japanese

  when he was gone choshimu a hand
still pressing his stomach said

  he can talk like a white man in our
village every one believes that i can also
because i can say gair hair out here and
wair hair my boy choshimu and
damfish got steenk but this man spoke
as well as you when i am a man i will
have a watch-chain like his and you will
be very proud of your boy you will
say he was not much when i bought
him but he is very fat now and some
day i will make a wrestler of him
westgaard smiled but did not answer
one by one he went over the events
he began to picture the sketch of the
screen of the two gods-gods of the
thunder and of the wind inaction always
troubled him if some one or more than
one were waiting for another try at him
let them have it swiftly the night train
had merely been a blind he believed now
that it was wiser to take it as he had told
the manager that open action might
really be the safer but at all events it
was action he said suddenly-

im going to leave you here baby
choshimus voice came instantly-
two men are better than one danna-
san unconsciously he mouthed what
had been said before him i am your
boy where you go i go

  westgaard did not agree when cho-
shimu finally squatted at his feet his torn
kimono revealing the thin brown body
beneath westgaard knew that be his
judgment what it might he would take
the urchin with him
the thunder god



iii

japanese were assembled at the
station to say good-by to friends or
relatives each carried a final gift
usually an imitation branch of cherry or
plum-blossom taxis dashed among
trams and rickshaws electric signs blazed
self-praise above the gray tile roofs

  a porter carried the two bags one
filled with clothes the second which had
been the messenger of death packed with
food and mineral water the tickets were
in westgaards pocket and the white
man walked rapidly along the crowded
platform knowing that the automobiles
arrival had been planned with the de-
parture of the north-bound train

  the noise and bustle the semi-occident-
al scene made westgaard feel for the
second time that the attempted murder
was meant against some one else-a white
man truly but not andrew westgaard
he had he knew no enemies he had
been shot at from across a street a
makeshift infernal machine had been
discharged in his room his food had been
poisoned but all by some one who had
never seen him closely

  robbery was plainly not intended
murder and not thievery was afield

  despite his half-hearted reasoning he
was alert watchful whoever wanted to
kill some one was well equipped for the
business being in a foreagn-style hotel
frequented by tourists had seemed per-
fectly safe if it were not neither was
any other place westgaard felt that the
whole business was impossible mane
foolish but he relaxed none

 boys hawked sandwiches of gray
bread fruit tobacco a seller of hot
macaroni howled his slippery ware men
said noisy farewells their women standing
a little back of them

  nearer the waiting train several drunk-
en japanese helped one more drunk than
themselves into the train with much
laughter and squealing from time to
time an observant little policeman wan-
dered over to them to quiet the yelping

  westgaards car was the same as that

into which the tipsy oriental was finally
pushed he hoped that the rioters would
get away from the steps he watched
them for a moment and was at last con-
vinced that they were what they seemed
-men who had celebrated to the best of
their ability he must be cautious care-
ful but not old-womanish

  when i am a man choshimu stated
gravely i will not be a safce-bladder on
legs i will drink like you danna-san
and none will know when i am filled

if you drink and i catch you at it-
you will beat me i know some
day- smiling up at the white man-
you will really beat me and perhaps it
will do me good

  there was no reason to wait longer
westgaards bags had already been taken
into the car the drunken japanese were
still at their riotous business their sober
countrymen on the platform gave them a
wide berth

  entrance was blocked out of a comer
of his eye westgaard observed that the
policeman was watching probably won-
dering how to get the carousers away with
the least confusion a japanese said-

  i am very ashamed of them
westgaard remarked that they prob-
ably thought they were having a fine
time as he spoke he started to push his
way gently through the men what hap-
pened next was too fast for westgaard to
comprehend

  a hand was fastened around his arm a
second grouped about his waist some one
snarled in his ear

  ketojin

  what westgaard did was instinctive
the result of what had already transpired
and his new caution instead of pushing
the men away or calling to the near
officer his free hand went to his coat
pocket

  he regretted the spat of his gun almost
before his finger had relaxed from the
trigger

  something burned him where he held
the gun he did not know whether it
pained before or after the shot he sup-
posed curiously in that instant that the


sidney herschel small

discharge had scared his own flesh be-
fore he had time to hope that he had hit
no one in his moment of fearful madness
the bodies swayed away from him moved
by the unexpected shot perhaps and then
returned in a mass overwhelmingly
he heard

  ketojin uchijcorosu kill him
with the grunted words he felt a new
hot pain in his side the gun was for-
gotten he tore his other hand from
whoevers fingers held it and smashed
down at the smaller men some one had
him about the legs choshimu was
screaming many people were yelling
excitedly the policemans whistle shrill
clear high pierced every other sound

  the japanese were pressed closely to
him both in anger and to escape the
heavy fists the very pack of bodies
protected the white man although one of
the japanese at the moment westgaard
crashed his fist into the upturned face
slashed upward at him westgaard
jerked his own head away and the
descending knife brought a wild cry of
pain from some other japanese

  teeth he believed were gnawing at
his knee he tried to kick out to remove
the voracious mouth even as he struggled
tried to shake himself free not knowing
that the crowding protected him the
idiocy of the whole proceeding struck him
forcibly

  a crowded station a policeman only
a few feet away and what was the fellow
doing other than blowing his whistle a
station in the heart of a great city-and
murder he shouted suddenly as if it
would explain everything

  im andrew westgaard what in-
  the answer chilled him

  we know it some one very close
screamed

  that it was he himself they meant to
kill lent a different meaning to the whole

  the japanese were pawing clutching
at him they were too close to use their
knives and so long as he kept his feet
actually impotent one of his attackers
westgaard saw kept away from the
others as if on guard this one cried

loudly something westgaard did not
hear clearly the result of it was almost
immediate the japanese tried to pull
away and a knife-arm in striking dis-
tance swung upward westgaard grasped
the wrist twisted the knife fell to the
platform

  the white man understood what they
were trying what he did not understand
was why the policeman kept tooting his
whistle why the hundreds of japanese at
the station did not come to his aid his
long arms grasped at the orientals he
tried to hold them tightly to him the
first to break away cut at his hand in-
stantly

  choshimu screamed again with an-
guish in his voice there was a second
shot and the roar of an approaching
machine dulling every other sound with
the wail of its siren

  westgaard stood alone the first
thing he saw was a bruise across choshi-
mus cheek the next that the station
policeman was attempting to follow what
appeared only as a bulge in the throng of
people a bulge like the gorge of a snake
where the attackers were fleeing

  choshimu edged up to him where he
stood alone none of the japanese was
nearer than ten feet although all were
now talking nervously excitedly

  i did my best danna-san he said
he dug a fist into one eye when i am a
man i will be able to fight one of these
pig-faces hit me but i will know him
when i see him again for i-

  westgaards side pained throbbed
he agreed with the returning station
policeman and a dozen of his summoned
mates who had arrived in the machine
that it would have been impossible to
shoot at the thieves when they attacked
him he answered their questions calm-
ly no he had never seen the assailants
before no he did not know why they
had assaulted him no he was not hurt
no he did not know what they looked
like no he did not care to come to
headquarters and explain since there was
no explanation yes he still intended
taking the train but who he was could be
the thunder god



ascertained at the office of the asiatic-
import

  the ranking policeman said

  we have never had such a thing hap-
pen before here in the crowded station
and they have all vanished but the
officer here how could he shoot he
would have hit you and he says and
i believe him that he thought he must be
dreaming an attack at umeda station
it is impossible

  westgaard said

  it is of no importance i am glad you
came impossible yes even while i was
keeping them from stabbing me it
seemed impossible

  and you can tell us nothing
  nothing

  when westgaard had climbed slowly
up the narrow steps into the car the
officer announced-

 iwanu to moshitara-i thought he
would not tell when he once said he would
not

  he is a missionary and disliked talk of
fighting another remarked

  he is probably a missionary because
he speaks our language no we are
wrong if he were a missionary he
would have rushed to his consul and we
would have a business on our hands
from the consulate he would have gone
to the newspapers it is bad enough to
report that a white man was attacked
and we did not catch the men who did it
it is bad but it could be much worse
that white man does not talk of fighting
he fights

  he did it very strangely he was
never angry i could see his eyes they
were blank he seemed to be asking
what does this mean while he used his
fists

 it was what does it mean that
westgaard in the train was actually
asking himself he felt dazed uncertain
anger had not been in his fighting nor
until the final moments fear had the
assailants done other than crowd about
him he would have been killed they
were he felt positive amateur murderers
they did not know their trade

  had whoever wanted his life planned
the final attack he had done it wisely
in the crowded station where surprize
kept interferers away-wisely but he
had picked the killers poorly what
chilled westgaard was that they knew
who he was and nevertheless wanted his
life

  choshimu had been very silent as he
sat beside his master he said now

  i will know the one who hit me he
can see from one eye into the other and
when i see him again-

  dont go after every cross-eyed man
you see im going to the wash-room
did you notice the man those devils put
on the train as he asked westgaard
began to observe the other passengers
all of whom were already looking at him
choshimu wriggled his nose

  he is not here he jumped off and hit
me while i was kicking the ankles of a
man trying to knife you he is the one
with the wrong eyes and i will know him
when i see him again danna-san

  westgaards wounds were no more than
deep scratches in the wash-room the
white man tied several tiny towels to-
gether and wound them as a bandage
about his middle next to his skin was
the belt with the thousand-yen notes it
and the notes were sticky with blood
the belt had been cut through twice and
westgaard wondered if it had saved him
from greater injury this was hardly
probable the belt was made of soft un-
tanned skin the bulge of the impro-
vised bandage would be visible once he
buttoned vest and coat he removed the
notes from it and slipped them into his
hip-pocket then he returned to choshimu

  the train shot past village after village
dark sleeping the serrated mountain
range running east and west swam in
glittering moonlight long-legged gray
herons flapped up sullenly as the engine
rumbled over bridges

  there had been no sleeper in the
first-class carriage the japanese the
strange happening at the station already
forgotten were sleeping on the long
side-seats a wriggling youngster was


sidney herschel small

handed about like a sack of oats while
several women tried to still his squal-
ling

  banana-skins orange-peel eggshells
and cigaret-ends began to litter the floor
westgaard closed his eyes to shut out
sight and sound choshimu was already
asleep beside him his head on the white
mans knee his shallow breaths coming
regularly softly

the rough sketch of the two gods
of the korin screen rose before west-
gaards eyes the wind god was replaced
entirely with the other more dread figure
kaminari god of the thunder giant
naked body with breasts like a womans
nine thunderbolts hair of streaming
gold muscular arms encircled with
bracelets at the corner of the carmine
mouth a gleaming pointed tusk curved
inward painted rays about the navel
ears like a pig-grasping toes-

  a train-guard came through and pas-
sengers were jerked awake to tender their
tickets westgaard gave up his own re-
ceived his transfer-point coupon when
the guard had finished and had seen that
every window was tightly closed and
fastened the trainman went to the
second-class car ahead noisily locking
and bolting the heavy door

  westgaard thought-

  im safe for awhile

  he leaned back in his seat his long
legs stretched into the aisle and he drew
them up under him japanese-fashion
he knew that the express would not stop
during the night or if it did no pas-
sengers would be admitted to the through
first-class carriage

  he did not close his eyes shut they
would vision again the thunder god of the
screen for no reason he could justify
the god had assumed new grotesquely
horrible meaning the pain in his side
had disappeared but he was positive that
sleep would not come the car true was
locked and bolted yet the safe thing to do
was to remain awake watchful choshi-
mu had said that the cross-eyed nip-
ponese-even granting that the excited

  boy had seen such a man-had jumped
from the train

  well it would be at least a day before
any one could overtake him once he
was in denshaiko he would buy the
screen immediately and wire carstairs to
meet him in tokyo rather than osaka
he would leave the same day he arrived
and then let the devils try and get him
it tickled him to think of their traveling
north when he would be on his return
journey he was half convinced that the
screen had something to do with the
attacks what else could it be into
the screen the menacing figure of the god
was woven

  westgaard moved his head slowly not
to disturb the gently breathing boy in
the northern sky the three councilors
had already opened their cold bright eyes
the vapors of night twisting round them
like silken dreams

  the train hurried north the wheels
clicked against the spaces between the
rails-clickety-clack they began to sing
a song

             clickety-clack

            youll never come back

over and over and over

  gradually the song of the rails dulled
to a murmur the stars seemed slowly to
go out and all things became viewless
blackness the blue-distant mountains
dissolved into the immense nothing

  slowly it seemed the mountains re-
appeared each chiseled pinnacle flinging
to the sky the decoration of reflected
moonlight rocks changed to flying
serpents and featureless monsters to
many-headed many handed gods to
painted foulnesses pictured obscenities
divinities of abomination at the gate
of a yawning cavern there hung a star
whose five shining points drew together
like the fingers of the clutching thunder
god

  westgaard stirred uneasily and the
dream vanished into the singing of the
rails clickety-clack clickety-clack click-
ety-clack the dream vanished and the
man slept heavily
the thunder god



iv

the central plains had been left
behind in the night when west-
gaard awoke the train was puffing its way
upward maples gave way to pine pine
to scrub oak volcanic mountains
rounded cones telling their origin and
history started trickles of water which
at the railway became brawling rushing
streams black in shadow through
tunnels the train roared while soft-coal
cinders worked their way in at every
crevice

  it is like the journey to the lowest
hell choshimu said to the white man
when a priest from a little village first
passes through one of these hill-holes he
must remember more prayers than he has
time to say

  westgaard was stiff chilled he drank
gratefully the hot tea that choshimu
brewed the boy gorged on the food
from the hotel but westgaard was not
hungry in the cold fight of day he
wanted to buy the screen return with it
and have the matter over with choshi-
mu was not so easily satisfied

  what does all this business of guns
and poison mean the boy asked

  no business for babies

  babies the urchin reminded him
can die just as well as men if i am to be
ghot poisoned and cut into small pieces
for picking i should like to know to what
purpose

  westgaard looked at the keen little
face

  you talk too much he said since he
had no desire to speak of the screen i
shall be forced to-

  beat me good tell me first and
beat me after i was unable to sleep all
the night thinking of it

  we go for a screen you are not-
to say anything of it i would not
danna-san ho what we go for is
something but never a screen wood
paper and paint do men kill one an-
other for such a thing danna-san you
have told me never to lie and now you
yourself- he paused examining the

  face of his master tell me about this
screen he concluded slowly

  merely a screen like other screens
look out of the window child

  next you will give me suck on a wet
cloth choshimu protested angrily
look out of the window eat an
orange hai i tell you men do not
kill for screens

  westgaard thoughtful said-

  i wonder if youre right he added
aloud if not the screen what then

  if you do not know how should i
automatically deep in thought the
white man said-

  if you become impertinent i will be
forced to-

  choshimu snorted grinned and then
said-

  the train is going slower danna-san
gradually the snorting engine slowed
its pace over a swiftly flowing river it
stopped entirely passengers began to
whisper together and when they had
examined the distance from train to black
water began to whisper anew

  they are afraid choshimu said in
westgaards ear

 and you

  i i am not afraid i shiver only-
well only because i am afraid some one
will know how frightened i am can this
little bridge hold the weight of these
great cars and all the people

  a door of the car opened and a guard
called out that the tunnel was blocked
much earth had slid before the entrance
it would be many hours perhaps the
next morning before the way would be
cleared

  those who desire he concluded can
go to a village near-by and spend the
day there

  a passenger who knew the route said
that it was unfortunate that the train was
stopped at this point they were he
said almost over the mountain and once
on the other side there were no more
tunnels a second passenger began
questioning the speaker how far was it
to the sea and from there to the end of
the line how long did it take to go

could one ride in anything or must one
walk the man who had traveled the
line before did not know

  i go in trains he said i do not
walk if the train stops i wait for it
to start again

  westgaard did not want to wait for it
to start he did not want to have the
following train catch up with him

  well go to the village he said to
choshimu

  and be eaten by fleas let us remain
here

  and have the bridge fall down with

us

  choshimu rubbed his nose

  you do not mean that he stated
you are like that other man you are
anxious to get somewhere

  westgaard had not thought of the
questioning passenger when he had left
the train and was shown the path to the
village he found that the other carrying
one small bag was already clambering
up the rough and narrow mountain trail
it took but a turn or two and the tall
white man was up to the other the
japanese turned and smiled

  i am glad to have company he said

  suspicion flooded through the white
man

  we can go together he agreed polite-
ly how did you know i spoke
japanese

  a shrug

  you spoke to your boy on the train
the other explained then rapidly it
is a good thing this path is in the shadow
otherwise- a glance at his paunch-
i would lose fat without going to the
springs

  westgaard wondered whether the
japanese had heard what was said to
choshimu it seemed impossible that he
had spoken loudly enough to be over-
heard he said pleasantly-

  you go far for the treatment of the
heated water

  a friend of mine told me of a wonder-
ful place you know the spring country
in the north

  westgaard said-

   no

    hai-ya well i go to a spring called
 shaidenko it is very good to remove
 surplus weight and i have plenty of that
 but i have very little time to spend away
 from my business i need treatment but
 i need it very fast so i go to this place
 i tell you of and i wish to get there as
 rapidly as i can

    westgaard did not see what difference
 one day would make nor why a plump
 comfortable japanese would want to go
 other than by train he thought sud-
 denly-

    if this fat fellows going to try any-
 thing ill throw him into the river

    he found himself trying to get a good
 look at the japanese when he did look he
 was disappointed he half expected to
 find that the mans eyes were crossed
 despite himself he was relieved

    if the fellow-passenger was mixed up
 in the business of the screen or what-
 ever the thing was westgaard wanted to
 know it he waited until it became neces-
 sary for the japanese to stop and rest his
 arms he heard him say that he had
 never seen a river flow so swiftly and
 then said suddenly-

   you dont mean shaidenko you mean
 denshaiko

    there was a brief pause

   have it as you will the japanese
 told him slowly if you had known the
 country had admitted you knew it i
 would not have-lied

    it is a bad thing to lie to my danna-
 san choshimu piped it angers him
 and-

    i should not say he angers easily or
 he would give you a taste of the bamboo
 when you need it

    he will some day when the seas leap
 over the mountains and the stork mates
 with the tiger perhaps

   the corpulent oriental grinned at
choshimu picked up his bags and said-
we might as well walk

   westgaard did not understand his
boy choshimu was usually unfriendly
and his attitude toward strangers was
ordinarily one of silent sneering
the thunder god



before the village roofs were in
sight the japanese turned and
stopped again

  i talked too much and so did you
he said frankly

  westgaard did not say a word

  i am going to denshaiko where no
strangers have probably been for years
you know the name of that village in the
hills and probably no other white man
does you really said nothing save to
contradict me but that was more than
you should well we both-go there
westgaard moved no muscle we both
talk too much and possibly know too
much suppose we call it even and go
together

  what makes you think i am going
there westgaard felt this was wiser
than any denial

  because you know the villages name
he looked toward the volcanic peaks
i go for the hot water treatments to
take a few inches of fat from my bones
although a few days of carrying a bag
up a mountain would do it as well and
cheaper would you care to tell me
what your business there is

  a simple enough question but why
your business didnt it signify that
the japanese had business of his own far
removed from losing a layer of fat
westgaard was ready to fence

  my business his eyes were on the
great cones certainly i do not know
what the word is in japanese- nor he
might have added in english-but i am
one of those who examine volcanoes
he hoped there was one near denshaiko
but the presence of hot springs made it
probable i write about them

  you could not find a better place
the japanese said he seemed relieved as
relieved as westgaard was to find his
explanation accepted

  as the three passed under a torii out-
side the village choshimu whispered in
his masters ear that he was becoming a
good liar but that he choshimu temple-
foundling could teach him to become a
better

  beside the village the stream hissed

 

westgaard was surprized to see that a
narrow boat was moored in a man-made
pool mamatsu-the japanese and west-
gaard had exchanged names-observed
the craft also and spoke of it when they
were in the crude inn and settled on
zabwton

  where would one go in a boat he
asked the white man that river would
be too much for one made of steel

  both were in yukata-the thin crepe
inn - kimonos given guests - and had
washed the soot from faces and bodies
it was pleasantly cool on the soft mat-
ting raw fish chicken fried in bean-
oil and egg-soup were followed by sake
and cigarets almost under them they
could hear the babbling of the water of
the stream a venerable nesan best the
village afforded did honor to the unex-
pected unusual guests

  mamatsu was very comfortable but
he admitted that his legs ached

  it will be easier returning to the train
it is downhill he said when westgaard
did not answer to the nesan he said
can one go to the train by boat

  the ancient girl bowed smiled all
over her face pleased to be addressed by
men of such great importance

  the honorable river flows the other
way to the sea she said

  how far to the sea

  to the sea

  mamatsu glanced at the white man

  i should not care to go down that
black water-alone

  westgaard settled back comfortably
a day or so will not matter to you
he said draining his tiny cup the
waters will not cool mamatsu-san
no no of course not still i dis-
like waiting i have very few days to be
cured and-

  you will risk your life for an extra
day

  mamatsu said meekly-

  i merely spoke of the boat

 they were silent while the girl filled
the cups

  how long does it take to get to

   cushions


sidney herschel small

 the sea westgaard asked the nesan

 her hands her arms in their butterfly
 sleeves fluttered the danna-san had
 spoken to her what a tale to tell

 fast-so fast she breathed but
 all the way to the sea it is dangerous
 o danna-san

 westgaard said to mamatsu-

 it might be quicker than by train
 hmm the volcanoes will not run
 away westgaard-san

 no-

 what difference will a day make
 none but waiting is not pleasant
 choshimu made a grimace

 you could lie better than both of
 them grandmother he told the nesan
 neither of the men heard him
 westgaard said sharply-

 suppose we-

 try it good

 they were careful to avert their eyes
 westgaard stood up

 if-

 we might as well-

 start to the nesan send for the
 man who owns the boat

 choshimu rocked on his heels

 shot poisoned pickled and now given
 as an offering to the water gods he
 whined what next

 mamatsu asked curiously what does
 he mean

 it was on the tip of westgaards tongue
 to say you know damn well what he
 means he said however hes afraid
 ill take up to the crater hes the worst
 coward in the islands

 since he glared at choshimu the boy
 did nothing save wrinkle his nose the
 summoned boatman was obviously ill at
 ease but he agreed to take the three in his
 craft

 the water is high he said an-
 other rain and no one could get down the
 river it-it is not a pleasure journey
 he added fearfully since he wanted the
 payment terribly-payment enough to
 buy a new boat perhaps the boat is
 very dry i am very careful i once-
 great argument-took a white man in it
 -oh not far not to the sea merely a

little way but he did not even have wet
feet save where he slid on the rocks
he-he paid well

  well we pay what is proper ma-
matsu snapped we waste time let us
go

  the boat was very narrow and was
made of thin slabs of mountain cedar
westgaard and mamatsu knelt in the
middle choshimu crouched in the bow
the boatman with a long pole athwart
the boat half squatted in the stem

  the three men the bags the boy
weighed the homemade craft perilously
deep in the water the owner mumbled
to himself but three gold yen already in
pocket and seven more promised at the
end of the journey said nothing if a
narikin and a ketojin and a boy of small
importance wished to risk their lives
what business was it of his he himself
might be washed into the river and killed
were it not for the fact that a priest of
the temple had said that he would never
die in the water provided proper offerings
were made to the temple katsu the
boatman had made the offerings as
much as two bowls of millet but yester-
day

  the river contained a midzu-chi-
water god katsu had paid the priest the
priest had prayed to the god if any one
were killed it would be one of the others

  katsu began to sing as he pushed the
boat from the still black pool

v

the river flowed swiftly until the
village was out of sight then the
boat moved less rapidly and at last katsu
was forced to pole

  is this what you call fast mamatsu
asked it will take us a week to get
anywhere

  katsu sucked in his breath

  it is a strange river he said in a
little while we will go down down so fast
that there will be no wind in your lungs

  westgaard had not been listening
he half turned to the boatman asking-

   millionaire
the thunder god



   does the tunnel here become impas-
 sable often

   yes it is a very high mountain above
 the tunnel on the other side the train
 goes down in the rainy season the earth
 slides but- an eye to possible addition-
 al payment- few danna-san are brave
 enough or strong enough to take the trail
 up to my village

   mamatsu chuckled

   i asked that question on the train he
 said slyly it was accident my friend
 there have been too many accidents
 lately the white man retorted

   the possibility of the blockaded tunnel
 had not occurred to him before as being
 premeditated if it were and mamatsu
 the agent the fat japanese would never
 catch him napping

   mamatsu asked the sky-

   now who would want to hinder a man
 about to peer into volcanoes

   westgaards answer came promptly-
 or a man who wishes to remove sur-
 plus fat

   there is that angle also mamatsu
 admitted

   the boat made slow progress in places
 the water was too deep for katsus long
 pole again and again the heavily-laden
 craft floated near the steep bank and the
 boatman pushed with his pole against
  the rocks trees thick luxuriant grew
 almost to the water wild cammelia
 dropped their bright pink flowers to
 become boats sailing to the sea

   those are very rare flowers katsu
 offered they grow nowhere else in
 japan

   westgaard had seen them all over the
 north

i was thinking of many things
mamatsu shouted and you talk of
flowers if you can not say something of
greater importance katsu be silent
katsu grunted-

   it is too bad if a man may not speak
 of the honor of his village

   i have seen those flowers all over
 nippon mamatsu said in the same loud
 voice when your mother told you
 that story she lied fool

  my mother did not tell it to me the
coolie muttered

  westgaard heard mamatsu whisper
that he had not thought she did aloud
the fat man said-

  whoever told you lied

  he was a white man and white men
do not lie

  to westgaard mamatsu whispered
again

  you see anger them and you hear
the truth they like to talk anyhow
loudly what white man you have
never seen one save the danna-san
here

  he sat in this boat i tell you and
right at that bend of the river he stepped
ashore to examine the pink blossoms i
stopped the boat he stepped ashore he
was a very learned man he had a box
with him and collected flowers he
said-

  mamatsu waved him silent

  had he many other flowers in the box
katsu

   i do not know i did not see the inside
of it he took it ashore with him the
others face puckered he took it
ashore but i do not remember seeing it
after that

  white man and japanese licked their
lips simultaneously

  how long ago was this westgaard
asked

  months four-five

  the white man relaxed

   and so it had nothing to do with acci-
dents or blocked tunnels mamatsu
jibed

  why are you interested in the busi-
ness of flowers

  mamatsu scratched his chin

  largely because you are he said
finally as if that explained everything
stop where you let the other white man
gather his flowers he commanded

at the bend of the river katsu said
here is where he got out he slipped
on that rock and he gave me a yen not to
remember about him i had forgotten
another lie like that katsu and we
pay only six yen at the end of the trip


sidney herschel small

  choshimu in the bow giggled while
katsu held the boat against the bank
mamatsu and westgaard scrambled out

  before they were a dozen feet up the
bank westgaards hand was-on his gun
if the boatman and mamatsu had planned
this together the first shot would go to
the fat japanese the second to the boat-
man there were no more bullets in the
gun he let mamatsu walk first and
watched his every movement

  mamatsu however seemed intent only
on the earth once he stopped and
pushed away hanging branches of a tree
once he stooped and examined the leafy
ground finally with a throaty chuckle
he pointed to several large rocks

  that box westgaard-san is under
those rocks do you see how mossy they
are but there are two of them at the
top from which the moss has been
scratched off-by fingers perhaps

  or by some boy sitting on them

  suppose we lift the rock exertion is
bad for my heart together we will do the
trick

  westgaard leaned against a tree

  i am not interested in rocks he said

  have it as you will mamatsu said
strangely after all it is none of your
affair

  the pudgy japanese was unable to
lift the best he could do was to push the
uppermost rock from the pile of its
fellows above the rocks was a sheer
steep bank these apparently had been
tumbled from the formation above

  you see mamatsu whispered glee-
fully holding up a small flat box in
this we have-the study of flowers he
pried the lid off with a bit of sharp rock
i should not like to be around when-
these bloom he said softly

 westgaard was silent as he looked into
the box like giant cigarets sticks of
dynamite lay side by side they were
plainly labeled in red in english and
bore the address of the american manu-
facturer the a-i westgaard believed
handled that very brand
i - none of the sticks are missing there
is no connection between a blockade to-

day and the man who hid these months
ago mamatsu raised a thick finger as
he spoke i expected to find something
here why a fool like katsu calling
cammelias rare you and i know they
grow on every hill katsu did not think
of that by himself very well-some one
lied where there is one lie look for a
second i did and see what we found
it is really very simple now- smiling
-it should be safe for you to remove
your hand from your gun my friend

  westgaard did not move

  who are you he asked

  mamatsu cocked an eye

  i go to take the cure i am a business
man you believe that as much as i
believe you go to examine volcanoes

  the white man said crossly-

  lets get back to the boat

  mamatsu tucked the box under his
coat

  it will be well if i do not slip he
said this box goes into the river when
katsu is looking the other way half to
himself half to westgaard this should
be a lesson to me there is nothing too
small to investigate he clambered
down from the rock and then changed the
last phrase to worry about he made
it peered at the white man to see whether
he had caught the subtle difference

  if you are in a hurry why did you stop
here

  mamatsu smiled made great business
of climbing carefully down the bank but
did not answer for the second time
westgaard let the japanese precede him
as the oriental stepped cautiously into
the boat he turned and winked at the
white man

  one lie leads to others he repeated

  i havent forgotten westgaard re-
turned

  no then in english smiling
broadly no volcanist

  the boat had begun to sway in the
swifter current before westgaard was
able to figure what the english word
meant

  it was perfectly obvious that the
japanese mamatsu did not believe
the thunder god



westgaards volcano story well he
westgaard did not believe the others
yarn either it was as far as it went
even mamatsu was going to denshai-
ko a tiny village celebrated for nothing
and hardly indicated on the maps for
what what else save the korin screen
mamatsu not only spoke english he
knew a word that was unfamiliar to
westgaard himself a volcanist un-
doubtedly was one versed in volcanoes
if mamatsu knew such a word there rose
the possibility that he had been educated
in the states or in england and was now
a curio buyer or expert he also wanted
the screen of the two gods

  it would be impossible to outbid the
a-i the old mans orders had been to
go the limit

  had mamatsu been in any way inter-
fered with attacked or did mamatsu
or the people behind him want the screen
so badly that they were willing to go to
any lengths to get it or-or what
why did mamatsu invite him to go with
him down-river surely the rival buyer
would want to get there first or did
the japanese fear that in some way the
train might get through before the frail
boat or that accident might delay katsu
and allow westgaard if he went by rail
to get the screen

the boat began to move still more
rapidly and katsu called that they
were to couch down and remain perfectly
still

  have you ever been shot at west-
gaard shouted

  he had been so filled with his own
thoughts that he did not realize that the
waters were beginning to swirl to roar

  westgaard thought that the other
cried sometimes but the increasing
noise of the waters might have made the
word really seldom or almost any-
thing else

  the river is angrier than i guessed
katsu screamed

  westgaard sensed an open note of fear
in the boatmans voice and twisting his
head around saw that the japanese was

fighting to get the boat out of the main
current and pole his way ashore even as
he pushed the current quickened and the
banks began to slide past at a more furious
pace there was no longer a chance to
turn back

  i complained we went too slowly
mamatsu shouted to westgaard i
have never had such a ride as this

  in the bow choshimu frankly lay on
his face snatches of his whimpering
whipped back to the others shot-
poisoned-ridden to hell in a boat-
westgaard cried out to him cheerfully
but the words were wasted as the water
roared more loudly

  the black river had changed color
it was now green like lightning even the
foam was green the walls of the ravine
closed in and spray from rock wall and
river rocks flew into the eyes of the men

  katsu was poling valiantly striving to
keep the boat in the dark central current
and away from the spots of lighter green
a sudden twist in the river allowed a
beam of sunlight to dance down it
changed the foam for time uncountable
to red-red like blood

  before katsu crouched down in the
boat westgaard knew that they were
being hurried helplessly along down the
roaring river a river high with rain
shooting through its rocky trough at
terrific rate

  the low heavily-weighted boat no
longer pointed downstream the bow was
turned from side to side and drenching
deafening spray leaped in the roar of
the water became ear-splitting

  a thud-a crash-the craft leaped
ahead again after a glancing blow
mamatsu cried-

  we hit

  katsu squealed back

  pray pray the boat has torn
away from me

  the black banks squeezed more closely
together they formed a gateway of
granite through which the boiling waters
had to pass the boat continued to gain
terrific impetus with every leap as it raced
headlong for the gap in the natural wall


sidney herschel small

  westgaards eyes were wide bright
unterrified strange exaltation swept
over through him he breathed with
difficulty since the spray dashed over
him but his head remained erect the
boat was still lower in the water west-
gaard could feel the coldness of it on his
knees and ankles

  out from cracks in the rocks ferns
grew-great frondswhich westgaard could
almost have touched by extending his
hand diamonds of spray clung to them
turning them to the awful green of the
river

  the white man strained to see choshi-
mu through the mist the boy was
huddled in a shapeless lump at the bot-
tom of the boat and westgaard wished
that the lad were nearer he reached
around mamatsu to touch the urchin
reassuringly a scream jerked him
erect

  the seat of the river god katsu
yammered throw out the ketojin
then the gods will see us safe oh gods
of heaven and earth and fire and water
and air we will offer you a hairy
foreigner if-

  mamatsu not opening his eyes cursed
him horribly

  squarely across the way of the boat was
a gigantic rock jutting from the greenish
roiling water spray wind wave had
carved it into semblance of a giant seat
against it water met rock with a terrific
crash was beaten thrown back upon
itself and with a baffled howl rose high
into the air in yellow spume to sweep
ahead on either side into the lower
river

  the boat was rushing on riding low
pelting ahead in great leaps mamatsus
eyes were tightly closed and he clung
desperately to the boat his mouth never
opened although his nose wriggled like a
rabbits ceaselessly as the nose of the
craft lowered he clutched convulsively
at westgaard in the stern katsu was
gibbering in prayer every god he
could remember was being heavily in-
volved

  the rushing water the crashing of the

turbulent water against the mimic seat
of rock grew closer and turned to
thunder

  thunder

  westgaard for the first time wondered
whether he would ever get to denshaiko
ever see the thunder god painted on the
korin screen he did not regret the de-
cision to go by boat had he remained
in the train the following one would
probably have meant that whoever had
attempted his life before would do it
again

  his eyes were open he saw the boat
swing with new sullenness toward the rock
rising as it swung in the backwash from
the boulder the river seemed roaring
with goblin voices hurled forth by the
bone-colored rock dedicated to the river
god a rock polished by thousands of
years of spray and water-tongues

  if the crude vessel were swept side-
wise water would engulf it instantly

  for a split-second the boat hung un-
decided in the backwash prey of a dozen
currents and forces it rose more highly
nose pointed downstream dipped let in
water at the bow plunged suddenly nau-
seatingly steeply-down-down-to the
right-away from the great rock

  spray stung westgaard like myriad
wasps he seemed in a hollow cave of
seething heated foam

  for the first time he actually thought of
the closeness of death-not in that mo-
ment for himself but for the terrified boy
he had brought with him no one could
hope to save himself either by clutching
at the ferns of the rockwall or by reaching
the boulder swimming was impossible
since the jagged teeth of rocks bit at the
boat as it swept along none could save
himself let alone another

  he had been near death before a
sneaking shot curiously was more terri-
ble than death met with open eyes he
wondered if death meant death he had
never thought of it before he hoped that
if choshimu must be killed it would be
suddenly at once as near painlessly as
possible

  sickeningly the boat swept by the
the thunder god



rock so close that a shrill high sound was
given out when it scraped they careened
shipped green water were smothered with
wild foam

  mamatsu cried in the white mans ear-
if you-get to-denshaiko-get-
the-

  and with his final word the boat
lurched and smashed down into the wid-
ening lower reach of the river into water
black swiftly flowing but smooth and
placid

  choshimu was sitting up blubbering
katsu remained on his knees finishing
his final prayer half unaware that he was
not to die yet

  westgaard drew a deep breath and
then said

  that was close what was it i was
to get for you in denshaiko

  the plump japanese shivered

  hai-ya he said jerkily what-
what a way to die i-i shall need no
mineral water-now tons of it are al-
ready in my lungs and-and i believe
i have lost-twenty pounds from-fear
it was not mineral water you wanted
me to get

  the danger was over-the immediate
danger the roar of the water was re-
ceding westgaard had never forgotten
his quest

  mamatsu shrugged feebly tried to ap-
pear unconcerned although he trembled
with revulsion

  no he said at last

  since that was not sufficient he said in
a more natural tone

  whatever i want i can get myself
he coughed spat and then continued
largely waving a pudgy hand this river
is known as the river of the singing wa-
ters what a song it sings

  katsu slowly guided the boat to shore
using a short implement half pole and
half paddle which had been lying along
the bottom of the boat his original pole
was floating down the river somewhere
after them

  choshimu called weakly

  i was almost killed in the water am
i to be frozen now danna-san

  westgaard wanted to question ma-
matsu further but knew that the japa-
nese would say nothing more about den-
shaiko

vi

through shadowing forests of som-
ber pine and cedar the river hurried
above the trees in the direction whence
they had come were the blue shapes of
hills overtopped by peaks and cones of
vapory gray

  a fringe of rye-field stepped down to
the river for a tiny space and then the
straight pale columns of the cedars bore
their massed black foliage to shadow the
way again

  as the river swept down seaward the
cedars the rye-fields gave way to succes-
sions of diked terraces green with rice
they swung rapidly past a little village
no more than a huddle of thatched huts
protected by winged torii and gray-tiled
temple on a rock by the water west-
gaard saw ideographs and symbols carved

  the air warmed the distances-where
they could glimpse them through gaps-
were gauzed with dainty mists filmy di-
aphanous like ghosts of clouds riding in
the wind katsu became talkative again

  no train goes as straight for the sea
as this river he said a train is made
by men but rivers are the work of gods
is it likely that men could do as well as
those who made them

  mamatsu tried to move his cramped
prickling legs

  how do you get back

  it is very simple of course it will
take some labor but i am very strong
and the river god is friendly to me it
is strange that we come down in hours and
go back in days however but- smirk-
ing-the fox is in my wife and i am in
no great hurry to return mah you
should hear her talk to me me a man
why once i told her-

  they were unable to cut off the flow of
words katsu the entire ten yen as good
as in pocket the prospect of a day in a
large village before him was growing
steadily happier and more annoying


sidney herschel small

  i will spend a few sen here and there
katsu announced ho i know how to
use money to the best advantage and i
know a place where a man can get electric
brandy very cheaply after that-

  you will think you are a river god and
turning into water will lie in the gutter
choshimu shouted

  if you were mine- katsu began

  i would do shinju the moment i was
born

  westgaard silenced them both it was
mamatsu who spoke first

  i have always wanted to leam about
volcanoes he said thoughtfully tell
me about them my friend

  gladly only first tell me a bit about
the hot springs there wthat type of
water is it then i can tell you about
the volcanic structure in that neighbor-
hood

 hmm well the waters contain-
valuable salts they are-hmm-good
for fat men   

  do they flow from the ground is
there steam are mineral deposits on the

sllfclc

 yes naturally of course he
paused and then said softly and vol-
canoes explode and go up into the air
that should satisfy us both

  westgaard was unable to resist say-
ing-

  i hope you get what you want in den-
shaiko

  not what i want what- punching
a finger into his flabby belly-what i
want to get rid of slowly the less i
speak of errands the better my friend
will that satisfy you

  westgaard said-

  why not and both became silent

  the farther the boat went the more
certain westgaard was that there existed
no danger in mamatsu choshimu cer-
tain sign liked the fat japanese had
mamatsu wanted to kill him and if the
nipponese were armed it might have
been done any one of a dozen times
whoever wanted to kill him cared noth-
ing for any other thing death was all

   	suicide

that had been intended that mamatsu
might have done

  there was no reason to tell mamatsu
anything although from choshimus
earlier howls the japanese probably had
done his own guessing least of all was
there any reason to tell him of the korin
screen or could it be the screen which
took the other to denshaiko

  seems ive seen you in an antique
store in kyoto westgaard said sharply
down on shinmonzen

  mamatsu grinned broadly

  you have missed your target he said
gaily if i am a curio dealer my friend
you are an expert in volcanoes how-
ever this time you have told too much
the villages were growing larger the
river broadening the boat moving more
slowly

  we might make better time if we
landed and were pulled to yasudo
westgaard decided

  an excellent idea o buyer of screens
  westgaard was not surprized

  he said

  if we both want it theres no reason
to fight about it is there i knew you
wanted something-and what else could
it be save the korin screen

  i knew you also wanted something
besides the smell of volcanoes in your
nostrils but it took a long time before you
trusted me enough to even indicate what
you were after well you did not trust
me and i-pulling a hand from his
pocket-trusted you little more my
fingers ache from holding my gun i can
tell you and when i walked first after
wed stumbled on the dynamite up-river
i could feel a shot in my back every other
step

 why

  mamatsu shrugged his usual gesture
why ask me other things my
friend but not that-yet but you were
shot at eh and poisoning was at-
tempted ask yoyrself this-is a mere
screen worth death

  worth a good many thousand yen
mamatsu-san

  have it as you wish one of us should
the thunder god



be able to purchase it but it will run the
bidding up

  would you shoot me to get the screen
if i buy it away from you

  the japanese shrugged a third time
it is hard to say now he admitted
if i do i will give you warning will
that satisfy you

  i suppose it must lets-lets get
ashore im sick of this damn boat

katsu was paid and chest stuck out
went to have the first taste of purple
brandy kurumas were found and the two
men and the boy were pulled rapidly
toward the next village promise of extra
payment sent thick legs scampering and
choshimu lighter than the others was
forced to hold on to the vehicle to avoid
being thrown out

  shot poisoned drowned and now
killed by a wagon with two wheels he
wailed

  is there no shutting him up ma-
matsu demanded of westgaard

  the white man said

 i can try hes only a kid he
called another word from you about
shooting and ill beat you

  choshimu shouted defiance but ma-
matsu noticed that no matter what the
other yelled he made no other reference
to unpleasant death

  three times they paid off their pullers
and took new kurumas westgaards head
began to ache from the side-sway of the
vehicles he stepped from his at yasudo
after the last change and waited for ma-
matsu to be pulled up

  it is something to pull me the japan-
ese said laughing my puller earns his
money now you are very long but you
are thin me i have some meat on me
ail nemui kotol how sleepy i am but
it is not evening and we want to get
farther it will mean another ride if you
can stand it denshaiko before night-
and back by train at once are we
agreed

  westgaard ran a hand through cho-
shimus hair the boys eyes were bright
but exhaustion was in them

  we need warm food westgaard de-
cided and i want some cigarets lets
eat first and then go theres no chance
of the train getting in tonight weve
time

  only keep away from the railway
station my friend you are very long
and your eyes are very blue and you have
a monkey named choshimu with you
you are easy to mark eat and smoke
only not at the station

  as they began to walk westgaard
asked

  whats it all about if you are after
the screen you ought to know why any
oned want to kill me and how about
you any one take a shot at you

  if i had sense i would say west- 
gaard-san my friend i believe i like you
but not sufficiently to be killed on your
account i have not been shot at but if
i stay with you i may be

  westgaard shortened his strides

 why

  the usual shrug

  you would be little happier for know-
ing and i am not free to tell you why
you want the screen i do not understand
its very old-valuable

  mahj valuable is hardly the word

it is vastly more than that

 again-

 why

  here is an eating-place and no more
answer

  pans of fried fish were brought the
three rice and tea when the meal was
eaten the frowsy waitress brought a small
pot of red jam and a round bowl into
the bowl she placed a spoonful of jam and
then filled it with tea this she offered to
westgaard

  what have we now mamatsu asked
do not i receive this new drink

  it is only used by seiyojin the girl
told her countryman they prefer it to
tea in any other way

  and what do you know of seiyojin
  the girl giggled

  other than that i mean mamatsu
spoke very calmly

  she bowed bobbingly and said


sidney herschel small

  one of them comes here he has eyes
almost as your honorable friends-oh
very blue when he laughs they become
almost black he taught me how to place
sugared fruit in the bottom of the tea-
cup

  he speaks japanese

  a little a very little he is always
laughing at his mistakes

  he comes alone to eat

 bowing-

  always alone

  and he lives-where

  i do not know her eyes clouded
no once he came with a japanese i
did not like that man his eyes could
look from one to the other

  you see i was right danna-san
and i will know that man when i see him
again

  and when you do choshimu i will
give you a gold yen mamatsu said
swiftly he half turned i thought i
heard some one- he began doubtfully

  the door moves with the wind the
girl assured him

  i have eaten burdock and radish and
black beans and fish omelet and lotus
root mamatsu said to westgaard
mochi and jcoyadofu and konuyaku and
seaweed and raw young sardines but i
have never heard of tea being spoiled by
jam have you

  some europeans probably like it
neither the english nor the americans
drink tea like that perhaps its-

  of no importance let us start
westgaard-san if choshimus belly is
properly filled

  if mine were as large as yours the
boy cried it would take a whole food-
store to fill me and it

  that i do not doubt young pig how
you hold so much is beyond me are you
ready my friend he asked the wait-
ress the only one the tiny eating-shop
afforded where kurumas might be found
and headed the way into the street west-
gaard saw how carefully mamatsu stepped
out observed that the japanese hand
was in his coat pocket

  it will be nearly dark before we reach

denshaiko mamatsu said lighting one
of westgaards newly purchased rank
cigarets you should be the first white
man they have ever seen it will be an
experience for those villagers

  westgaard believed that mamatsu ex-
pected him to doubt the last statement
but said nothing what had started as a
search for a screen-valuable but not un-
usual-had by now throbbed itself into
what seemed a question of his life into
which impossible events had crowded

  the first faint purples of sunset were
already turning the westward sky to the
hue of grape-dust

the dirt street was empty at an
intersection of narrow ways a beggar
dirty as the dust crawled up to ma-
matsu

  brass coin-only a brass coin he
whined one copper a rin i starve

o	rich and honorable gentleman my
feet can not walk nor my hands convey
food to my mouth give me a copper in
the name of kishibojin great and power-
ful mother of beggars or i starve
westgaard averted his eyes from the
cripple from the wild eyes and matted
hair at that instant choshimu cried out
mamatsus gun barked

  the beggar had leaped erect and flashed
a knife at the white man mamatsus
bullet had struck him as he was on his
feet the beggar swayed the knife dropped
to the dust and he over it

  both you and i now have holes in our
coats mamatsu said evenly i watched
him he begged from me but watched you
my friend and so when choshimus
sharp eyes saw him start to his feet i was
ready pull off his rags and let us see
what is beneath them

  i-i never saw a man die so fast
westgaard whispered to the japanese

  a perfect shot the other announced
rags rags-and nothing else he
lifted a dead clenched hand and let it
fall with a little thud to the earth

  he is deadfand you are alive he
said sorrowfully although his eyes twin-
kled that is something but i wish i
the thunder god



had merely wounded him so he could have
talked i told you it would be dangerous
for me to travel with you

  westgaard rose to his knees unable to
take his eyes from the now nude body
from which a red trickle ran into the dust

  he must have been crazy was all he
could think to say he did not believe
the beggar crazy he was starting to fear
what appeared a widespread plan to keep
him from the korin screen

  villagers came swarming into the street
it is harakoto one said in answer
to mamatsus question he- point-
ing to westgaard-stole his wife we
knew a seiyojin visited the woman but
he came at night when harakoto was at
the station making money and we never
saw him

  and who is this harakoto-or who
was he before he started the journey to
hell

  a beggar his father taught him the
trick of appearing crippled and he made
much money many yen and-

  wtiere is this beggars house

  on this street but his wife has left
him ask the seiyojin where she is not
even harakoto knows

  westgaard whispered

  you see he was crazy

  yes well let us get away before
these fools babble the story clear to the
temple gates

  they were riding out of yasudo before
mamatsu said

  if i had wounded him we might
have had his story from himself i have
spoiled a good coat for no purpose
you are both fools choshimu shout-
ed the boy rode at westgaards feet
now since they had been able to get only
two vehicles this dead man-had he
never seen the man who took his wife
assuredly he had he knew what the
other white man looked like and if he
had been the same in appearance as my
danna-san the waitress would have said
something about it no that killer knew
what he was doing

  both men stared ahead the same
thought had been in both their minds

  and if you had not shot him i should
have killed him the boy added

  by drowning him with spittle

  no fat one with this

  choshimu proudly produced a knife
whered you get baby westgaard
asked

  at the train when-

  westgaards hand covered the boys
mouth kurumayas were human horses
and also had ears

  it is a good story mamatsu jibed
only i saw you pick that knife up when
the beggar dropped it

  you lie that was another knife
reaching into his kimono with his empty
hand choshimu drew forth a second
blade

  mamatsu sighed hugely

  we are at last safe he proclaimed
  even the angered boy laughed

  the pullers settled down to their work
as they dragged the vehicles upward
peasants gazed wonderingly at the for-
eigners boys clothed only with a soft nar-
row strip about their loins ran out for a
nearer look at the white man workers
with hats pointed like the straw roofs of
wayside shrines lifted their heads and
stared dumbly

  the path became narrower at last the
kurumas could be dragged no farther
mamatsu climbed down stiffly

  it is obvious that from this point on
we walk he said

  in the terraced fields were thrust thin
bamboo shafts-arrows of prayer around
them were fences of bamboo rods from
which hung fringes of straw and paper as
protection from heat and insects and as
invocation to the god of growing things

  the fields ended abruptly and the un-
used path began to climb through thick-
ening timber somewhere a waterfall
plunged mamatsu said in a tired voice
if it is much farther i will sleep on
the path

black night slipped down again and
again the men stumbled against the boles
of trees the forest was still save when
a night-bird hooted-ho-to-to-gi-sooooo
the people believe he is calling to


sidney herschel small

devils mamatsu said and choshimu
shivered

  can you kill a devil with a knife he
asked

  there is no demon who could with-
stand two of them

  with startling abruptness the trees
ended before them below the path was
a wide silver sheet its surface reflect-
ing like steel the bulk of the near moun-
tains stars flecked the unrippled surface
with ghostly gauzy bronze night trans-
formed the rugged cliffs to blue and gray
amethystine-exquisite spectral

  to their left a torii straddled the path
beyond it were the flickering yellow lights
of a little village

  denshaiko mamatsu said softly

  westgaard was about to say that it was
very beautiful when close a startled bird
jeered again-ho-to-to-gisooo the cliffs
threw back the cry o-o-ooo

  devils choshimu whispered con-
vinced and slipped his hand into his
masters

vii

the ancient priest who met them
had an air of patient expectancy his
robes were old and rusty his face was like
wrinkled parchment once the robes had
been purple and violet silks shot with
dragon-designs in gold once westgaard
supposed the old mans face had been
fresh youthful the white man believed
that sosamo priest of the temple was the
oldest man he had ever seen

  when mamatsu greeted him the priest
bowed and hurried to pour water over the
three pairs of hands-three times-from
a ladle-shaped vessel of bamboo he gave
each a threadbare blue towel with mys-
terious white characters upon it

  now you are all pure he said bowing
again what brings you to denshaiko

  your sacred springs mamatsu said
instantly i-well i am very fat and
at times i ache a friend told me of the
heated waters here and so i have come
for relief my friend here from across
the seas is here to-

  buy your korin screen westgaard
said

  haiya cried mamatsu that is no
way to conduct business we have tea
we talk we are shown the screen and
then only is it time to descend to neces-
sary business

  so you desire the screen also sosa-
mo asked your white brother asked
me first we will see what he has to offer
then perhaps it will be your turn he
smiled at both we have no servants
here i must prepare the tea myself
then we will talk of this and that push
back that shoji the screen is in the altar-
room i hate to sell it but the temple
must have money and servants and
priests and- his ancient face became
grim-there is need of the gods here
when the old man padded from the
room mamatsu scratched his chin

  i am to be forced to shoot you after
all he said no further admission that
he wanted the screen was needed
westgaard said-

  what did he mean by there is need
of the gods here

  we may find that out my friend now
let us see this screen

  the next room was matless covered
with dust everything within was molder-
ing and worn the shrine had no image
there hung some poor paper lanterns
whose once bright colors had vanished un-
der layers of dust before the empty
altar rested the frame of a metal mirror
the mirror itself gone so small that
westgaard at first did not see it there
was beside the mirror-frame a tiny figure
of some god-the earth god mamatsu
said-kenro-jijin gray vaguely carved
holding in one hand a spear in the other
a minute cup

  clear against the far wall of the cham-
ber stood the screen on the right leaped
the wind god his draperies flying his feet
buried in cloud facing him was the god
of the thunder his hair flaming gold
mamatsu said gravely-

  it is very old and very sacred

  the white man stepped close to it and
bending examined the signature in the
the thunder god



comer beneath the thunder god it was
identical with that on his sketch laugh-
ter shook mamatsu

  if it is an imitation he chuckled it
was done in the days when none thought
of such things can not you see how old
the screen is westgaard-san older than
you or i or both of us made when gods
were gods and not names and know this
-we are not willing to allow our gods to
leave the country-even their pictures

  i do as i am told westgaard said
shortly i dont want the screen

  ho and i said what i knew-not
what i thought my friend

  a fat man should think of his belly-
and i am hungry again choshimu put
in

  the priest stood at the opened panel
if you are ready danna-san-
sosamo knelt before a brazier he him-
self had kindled in the first room he
ground tea-leaves to powder in a metal
bowl and then slowly dipped water over
them pouring the result into cracked han-
dleless cups the thick green mixture
was handed to each of the two men
choshimu was allowed merely to watch

  when i was younger the tea cere-
mony was a ceremony sosamo mourned
but i am old and forgetful and this is
the best i can do even the tea is of
miserable quality i have become accus-
tomed to hot water it is really as nour-
ishing as tea and i suppose i like it
this is delicious mamatsu pro-
tested

  the ancient cocked an eye at him and
choshimu laughed wickedly the priests
keen old eyes shifted to the boy

  you he said know too much about
lies not to lie yourself youngster he
said

  it is his great fault westgaard
agreed smilingly

  he should become a rich man then
sosamo grunted is that what you
want child

  the darkened chamber lighted by but
one rapeseed-oil lamp the presence of
many objects of veneration the ancient
priest all were working on the boy

  instead of flippancy he said in a reedy
voice-

  i want to be like my danna-san

  for a moment the old eyes peered into
westgaards blue ones

  you could do worse the priest said
slowly now the screen

  westgaard decided swiftly that sosamo
would never bargain the priest had
offered no word of praise for the korin
had made no mention of its art its age
good he would name his top figure-
every yen he had with him if mamatsu
could or should go higher it was not his
fault sosamo would never listen to hag-
gling either with himself or between the
two rivals

  a hundred thousand yen he said
slowly

  mamatsus breath hissed through his
teeth he said no word a second time
the priest examined the grave white man

  the screen is yours my son he said

  his eyes closed what he said issued
from his thin ups like a cold stream

  i have slept beside the gods of the
screen when i was sick i have sat beside
them when i hungered and had no food
i have prayed to them when my soul
ached--and i have sold them his eyes
opened better to help my people than
to love an ancient screen my people
have forgotten it but when it thunders
and the ground shakes they will remem-
ber the gods it has been very peaceful
here even the mountain above no
longer puffs smoke but is satisfied to have
clouds circle its cone perhaps the god
is no longer needed

  in the silence westgaard heard the
trickle of water and smelled sulphurous
steam

  come and see our little village so-
samo suggested

  westgaard looked at the screen

  it has been here many years the
priest smiled it has not been stolen
yet my son why should it be stolen
now even artists have come to admire
and copy it but none would think of steal-
ing it even with only a worn-out priest
to protect it


sidney herschel small

  about the rough roofs of the village-
huts wreathed steam and sulphurous va-
por from a bank at the edge of the col-
lection of shacks was piped the hot water
itself to fall in hot steaming little cas-
cades to a shallow pool which drained into
the cold waters of the lake above the
bamboo pipes were stark scarred cliffs
stained yellow red and white into them
the steam of a hissing bubbling hidden
cauldron sent surging clouds of gray-
white on either side was the dense green
of trees

  if you go a little higher you may see
the water itself come from the bowels of
the earth sosamo told them

the lake westgaard supposed was the
crater of some extinct volcano venture-
some choshimu stuck a finger under a jet
of water and how ling drew back his hand
it burns

  mamatsu asked

  did you think it steamed because it
was cold a bath in it might be good for
you-wash away a few bad habits such
as calling me fat one

  you will have your flesh burned away
and be as thin as a ghost

  the pudgy japanese examined cho-
shimus red fingertip and then looked at
the jets of torrid water he grinned at
westgaard-

  i am not so very fat he said
westgaard wished that he were on the
return journey the screen represented a
hundred thousand yen of a-i money
why was mamatsu so jovial and con-
tented a sudden doubt assailed him

  the screen has been copied you said
father 

  many times korin was a great artist
and much admired the screen is well
known and the object of veneration
could a copy have been made and put
in place of the original why not he
westgaard was no expert on art or
screens easy to fool him did the old
priest himself have a copy made and did
mamatsu know it

  in the little interval sosamos body was
drawn up to every possible inch he
merely said-

  i am a priest of the gods but that
was sufficient

  westgaard stubborn because he was
nervous asked-

  it might have been changed in your
absence or while you slept

  and would i not know it the next
time i looked o man that screen has
been wife and son to me i have watched
it grow old and in the last year it has
aged even as i have let me show you
a copy my son a good copy then you
yourself can see the difference

  he led the way to a hut in the village
an artist comes here for the cure he
went on to amuse himself he has
made another screen he wrorks on it
ceaselessly but can not make it the same
as that which was mine

  there was so far as westgaard could
see no difference save in age this second
screen was as like the other as are two
grains of rice but it was brighter in color
and less smoky-hued the gold glittered
the red flamed there was no gentling
process of years

  would you sell it also the white man
asked i would like it as a thing of
memory

   if it wrere mine i would give it to you
sosamo answered but it is not mine
and i can not besides the owner is very
proud of it come we have had enough
of screens if it were earlier i would have
food bought for you but as it is i can offer
only sleep and a feast in the morning it
seems strange to have money again
when they had returned to the bare
temple westgaard said carefully

  i have orders to return with the screen
at once i must go this night i would
like to stay but i can not

  reaching into his trousers pocket he
handed without a count a roll of bills to
the priest

  i knew you offered all you had so-
samo said quietly that is probably the
reason i said yes

  mamatsu blinked he told west-
gaard-

  i thought the money was in a belt
around your waist
the thunder god



  the white man unbuttoned coat vest
and shirt pulled loose the improvised
bandage made of towelling wincing as the
dried blood tore away from the wounds

  the beggar was not the only one he
said you return with me mamatsu-
san

  for a second time the abrupt frontal
attack disconcerted mamatsu the pur-
chase of the screen so simply so easily
had upset him originally westgaard had
sensed this and knew that mamatsu was
fishing about in his mind for the proper
move to make that the japanese had
come from tokyo or yokohama for the
screen was certain what would he do
about it now

  mamatsu blinked again shrugged spat
out of the door scratched his chin at
last he stooped to the priests ear and
whispered rapidly the priest nodded an-
swer

  you need a protector but i am too
tired and too fat to go with you sosamo
has just told me that i am welcome to
stay even if you depart did the
priests eyes move westgaard believed
that they did and so i remain in com-
fort o restless one go ahead-and good
luck but offer no money to beggars
and when you are again in yasudo that
is if i-no when you are in yasudo
board the train and stay in it you hear
me

  westgaard knew beyond doubt that the
japanese was upset undecided

  and when you are again wherever you
are going with the screen tell your em-
ployer-whoever bought the screen-that
he should inform-hmm well it de-
pends upon who your employer is-kail-
tell him-nothing i am upset i am
indeed

  not until the japanese had finished his
disjointed sentences did westgaard realize
that he had been speaking in english

  westgaard was not elate he had a
hundred questions to ask mamatsu who
was he why did he want the screen
who was the beggar what was the
shooting and knifing about why hadnt
mamatsu made a greater effort to pur-

chase the screen or to offer an objection
to his taking it now why why
what what

  the priest- what was meant by his
saying that there was need of the gods in
denshaiko mamatsu- what had he
whispered to the priest wasnt it the
priests answer that made him acquies-
cent what had that answer been and
what the question

  it was too much for westgaard

  he had indeed accomplished his pur-
pose had brought the business to the
place where the screen was his-the a-is
nothing remained save to get it safely
home his plan was ready he would re-
turn in the dark to the outskirts of ya-
sudo leave choshimu and the bags hidden
by the roadside then hire a kuruma and
be pulled to the next railway station it
meant a long return walk but all down-
hill choshimu was young and a long
sleep would set the youngster right again
he himself was not tired just as he was
not elated he had done his job the
thing to do was to see it entirely over

he bowed picked the screen up and
tucked it under one arm he took
the bag in the other hand he saw that
as soon as they were out of earshot cho-
shimu intended to say that he was hun-
gry tired and would not go another step
he said pleasantly to mamatsu-

  i hope you enjoy the waters here
there was no sting in his words he
wanted to tell mamatsu that he realized
he had been lucky and that he was still
watchful

  mamatsu took it the same way

  i hope on my part that a volcano
grows across your path and you are forced
to climb over it vastly more than
westgaard the corpulent nipponese
seemed satisfied with himself whatever
had caused this could be only one thing-
the whispered words between mamatsu
and sosamo westgaards distrust re-
turned anew mamatsu was pleasant a
good companion more he had saved
westgaards life but just the same he
might be ready to take it now


sidney herschel small

  westgaard bowed slightly a second
time and then stepped from the temple
choshimu directly behind him

  the screen was bulky of an awkward
size to carry care was necessary or
some low branch or shrub might tear
through the delicate material and ruin the
screen entirely he started cautiously
along the lake-path choshimu whined
continually

  shot poisoned stabbed drowned and
now killed from lack of food and sleep and
by too much walking am i a cloud that
it takes no effort to move along am i
a snake that i have no legs to ache is
my belly no larger than a fleas what
do you think i am in the same whis-
pering voice i tried to hear what the fat
one said to the priest but caught only one
word-path

  westgaard nodded after a few more
paces he set down screen and bag

  i have my hands filled baby he
said here is the gun keep it in your
hand there are only two shots in it if
you hear anything wait until you are cer-
tain telling me that i may take the gun
from you and use it but if you hear
nothing-and a knife in the hand of a
waiting man makes no sound-shoot at
any one you see and unless there are
more than one keep going down the
path and go back to osaka with the
screen-or-

  it was a feeble plan at best choshimu
made it impossible by saying

  i stay where you stay i am not
afraid to shoot a gun but i would not hit
anything a knife is a mans weapon
anyhow i think the old one in the tem-
ple frightened you as much as you could
be frightened by any one are-are we
old women

  westgaard said as to an equal

  i only want to get the screen to my
people infant it isnt that im-

  am i a fool choshimu began his
litany shot-poisoned-drowned-and
now considered a fool since my master
believes i think he is afraid what next
it had been dark when they left the
temple but a great pale moon now flooded

the placid lake turning the reflection of
the volcanic peaks to ebony

  westgaard followed the path carefully
at the entrance to the bordering forest he
knew that even greater caution from at-
tack from damage to the screen must be
exercised in the woods the weird cry of
the night bird called the echo sprang back
and forth across the level lake

  the white man lowered his head and
set his feet on the invisible path then all
at once a great pain hammered through
him the lakes light flamed to molten
brass to the red of blood the crags and
cones danced diabolically hand in hand
he heard as from a great distance cho-
shimus voice in fear the peaks whirled
and plunged into the inferno-hued waters
and turned them-all at once-into inky
blackness

  before the second and unnecessary
blow was smashed down upon his head
westgaard was unconscious

viii

slow pulse-like movement gentle
yet sending resultant throbs through
his head his eyes opened above him
stars thrust down distressing painful
points of light stars which wriggled
twitched were never still he was he
knew flat on his back bound very tightly
and carried along effortlessly noiselessly
undoubtedly carried in a boat and over
the lake a second body was beside his
own but he did not try to touch it for
fear that he would find it cold

   the effort of a turned head brought ex-
quisite agony over the loy side of the
boat he was able to see the lights of a vil-
lage-denshaiko-and over it the tower-
ing peaks and cones of the mountain he
tried to lick his lips and knew then that
he was gagged

   clear to the far side of the lake the boat
was propelled and then swung round it
began to follow the shore naked rock
loomed high the boat slipped along the
cliffs until at an angle in the rock a
blacker mouth opened and the rowers
guided the boat into a broad cavern
the thunder god



  no word was spoken the place was
black a shower of hot water dripped
from above touching the white mans up-
turned face like feverish fingers oozing
blood

  the boat was no longer paddled or
rowed but advanced by being pulled by a
man or men hauling on a rope fastened
to the rocky side of the cavern the boat
scraped against the rocks with little grat-
ing noises

  for several minutes it proceeded in this
manner then the man in the bow took a
stone from the bottom of the boat and
rapped heavily-fhud-thud-thud-thud-as
if in signal the hollow echoing was reit-
erated with thundering repercussions
throughout the cave roaring tumbling
sound crashed from rock to rock

  silence blackness again for a full min-
ute

  then a great burst of light coming
from the mouth of a tremendous and
lofty archway of rock opening into the
narrower channel at right angles the
vault was fully fifty feet above the water
and the wails as far apart far up on the
left near the roof was a projecting white
rock on which fiamed a battery of huge
candles unwinking in the still air of the
cave above the rock white water
dripped water so hot that it steamed as
it fell

  the seeping trickle made the cavern
seem full of voices as if a host of goblins
were holding converse against a shelv-
ing rock the boat was pushed and tied
the man in the stern of the boat
stepped forward bent over westgaard and
said-

  he is aware of the world again

  the cave howled back-

  world again

  westgaards legs were unbound he was
cut loose from the boat and shoved to his
feet as he stepped unsteadily from the
craft he saw that choshimu was on the
boats bottom

  he reached down swiftly he knew that
choshimu was unconscious or at least
simulating oblivion but not dead

  come snarled the man who had been

in the bow of the boat he indicated a
path cut in the rock

  westgaard said-

 this boy-

 kono baka yaro me nani nukashi
agaru what is the damn fool gabbling
about asked the second man

  his mate said

  if he wants to carry the boy let
him he is a large ketojin anyhow
and we might have to come back for the
brat

  first one japanese then westgaard
carrying limp choshimu and then the
other oriental-in that order they started
up the rock path the light was no longer
dazzling now that westgaards eyes were
accustomed to it after the darkness the
way was steep difficult below was the
black depths of the grotto at times the
path barely wide enough for feet jutted
over it like a shelf

  westgaards head ached increasingly
from exertion for moments he thought
that a new trickle of heated water was
flowing down his cheek then he realized
that the flow was steady and down one
cheek only movement had started the
blow on his head to bleeding again

  the body of choshimu grew a heavier
burden the boy hardly breathed the
white man thought-

  they might have hit him with less
force

 they- who the boatmen natur-
ally but was that all never what-
who-was back of the boatmen he was
being taken somewhere why for
what purpose

  what save coming and getting the
korin screen had he ever done and
where was the screen had mamatsu en-
gineered the waylaying

  this last he doubted mamatsu might
have slugged and robbed him of the
screen but would never have done more
than leave him on the path to recover
and-the white man believed-would
probably have seen to it that some one
from denshaiko discovered him and car-
ried him back to the village

 if not mamatsu-who he would he


sidney herschelsmall

supposed find out soon enough possibly
too soon

  beside the candles the boatmen paused
knelt prayed to nothing more than water
or rock or candles and picking one of the
tapers from its melted grease blew out the
others

  ahead now westgaard saw a hole cut
in solid rock into it the first of the
japanese scrambled there was barely
room for westgaard and the burden in his
arms to follow

  each step was bringing the white man
to more perfect realization of the scene
which might follow on this last he did
not care to think he believed that he
might with success hammer down the
japanese before him but the man behind
would make short work of any attack

  westgaard shifted choshimus body
slowly the gun was gone

  choshimu seemed to stir to breathe
irregularly and westgaard whispered-

  baby where are you hurt

  silence then

  my head buzzes there are bees in
it

   lie still

  going up a steep incline the candle be-
gan to flare as air from a larger chamber
in the rock blew against it

  choshimu said-

  gair hair out here

  well enough to get out but how

  since the captors could not understand
choshimus demand in english that
westgaard and himself leave even if pro-
fanely the white man answered in japan-
ese

  it is impossible one ahead one be-
hind

  set me-down i can walk if you-
hold to my hand danna-san

  at the exact moment that westgaards
eyes caught light ahead choshimu whis-
pered on tiptoe to gain the white mans
ear-

  they took one knife but i have the
other

  then a sharp angle brought them into
another rock-chamber almost as large as
that of the pool

  if choshimu had only given him the
knife before if he had only thought to
try and find one- if if if

  light blinded him now behind him
behind the japanese following him a rock
door was slid into place fitting into the
stone corridor perfectly

westgaard the pupils of his eyes
contracted stared ahead of him
what seemed a flaming candle turned al-
most at once into the gold of the screen-
the hair of the thunder god

  it was the screen it must have been
carried there before him

  there were strange paintings on the
wall-weird foxes gilded gods of many
heads and many hands a chisel had cut
crude freizes of animals and men in the
rock silk of many colors covered portions
of the bare stone but dominating the
strange rock-room was the screen of the
two gods

  westgaard thought

  theyve got the screen why do they
want me-

  the room sent a chill through him the
unreality of it tokyo only a day away
automobiles messenger-boys telephones
-he had thought of that before leaving
osaka was this thought in some curi-
ous way premonition

  both japanese had disappeared behind
the screen

  choshimus fingers tightened about
his

  i think we are going to be killed dan-
na-san he whispered

  westgaard supposed that in some re-
mote comer of his brain he must have
been thinking the same thing he ad-
mitted nothing of this fear to the boy

  we have been in tighter places than
this he whispered back i
a voice said mockingly in english-
i doubt it

  westgaards heart bounded

  he kept his head steady he did not
glance around the room he said evenly
while his heart did double-knock against
the wall of his chest

  dont doubt what you do not know
the thunder god



come out where  can see you whats
the meaning of this foolishness

  the sight of me would destroy your
eyesight the mocking voice continued
or i would satisfy your curiosity
youre behind the screen if i knock
it over-

  several nervous fingers will be glad to
shoot you before your hand comes up
no we talk as we are

  westgaard suddenly wanted time
may i sit down your accomplices
werent any too gentle with us

  gladly the floor is just below your
feet it is rocky but you might as well
get used to rock

  fear welled in the white man even
choshimu not understanding the words
of the hidden speaker trembled west-
gaard said quietly

  why should you want to keep me
here he did not squat on the floor
the idea of being off his feet was distaste-
ful im not good at guessing riddles
if i let you go you will forget about
the korin

  westgaard almost said yes but in
the same even tone said no

  the answer was mocking

  you are a good boy you will go to
heaven when you die it made no differ-
ence what you answered

  no i suppose not but what happens
when my people miss me when i do not
return

  laughter

  do you think they will ever find you
here

                                     

  westgaard shot into the dark
perhaps not but will you care to
have people searching around it seems
to me you must like privacy

  i had thought of that the other in-
formed him immediately it was the
lesser of two evils if you had any sense
you would have seen that you were not
wanted here and stayed away but since
you could not be persuaded-

  by shots or poison

  not be persuaded-and so here you
remain you wanted to get to den-
shaiko you shall stay here

  gradually westgaard was becoming
more positive that here was no japanese
speaking english it was beyond reason-
able doubt a white man no blurred 
no hissing s nothing was to be lost
by frankness

  my office sent me after the korin
perhaps theres some sense to you-a
thing you say i havent got if so i dont
see it

  the other laughed

  you are one of these-what is the
word-go-getters i dislike to hurt your
sense of pride but you never had the
korin my dear man

  he spoke english but he was neither
english nor american

  i had it in my arms

  bah you are completely a fool the
korin has been here for months and
consequently you show yourself a liar
any one who pays a good many yen-
he didnt know the amount-for a screen
ought to be an expert and you are not
examine this screen-oh from a distance
dont come more closely examine it is
it stained with smoke does it look an-
cient no it needed no treatment the
other was so carefully copied that it
fooled that old priest who however is
probably half-blind you never had the
korin my dear fellow although if i had
known how matters turned out i might
have let you have it yes i might have
left it in the temple and then when it was
sold-as the priest has talked of selling
for some months-it would not have
m-m-m-m-

  the sound hummed out

  not have mattered if it were discov-
ered that the other is a copy westgaard
concluded for him if it is such an ex-
cellent copy the one i bought it might
not have been discovered

  the other did not reply greater and
greater became westgaards desire to see
the hidden man

  weve talked plenty westgaard said
sharply you know who i am-an em-
ployee of an american company thi
youngsters my boy i was sent here fc
the screen


sidney herschel small

  sent by who

 my company i-

  you lie oh they sent you but who
told them to get it

  dont know

  in a higher voice

  you lie again if you want your free-
dom tell the truth who sent you i
can find out if i wish

  find out i dont know

  you are mistaken i can find out
from you

  the meaning of it sunk in

  it will be a worthless task any-
thing you force from me will be a lie
since i do not know

  we will teach you how to talk
  westgaard said softly-

  no you will merely teach me how to
lie and you are probably a master-hand
at it

  he did not want to anger the other
but what else was there for him to do or
say choshimu had edged closer to him
he felt the boys body against his and
then he felt a knife slipped slowly care-
fully into his hand the two stood to-
gether in this position the knife con-
cealed better first to try once more at
conciliation explanation

  very well i bought a bogus screen
you have the real one and you will not
sell i can truthfully say that the best i
could get was a fraud if you want to
bargain for my silence and do not want
hundreds of japanese officials swarming
about denshaiko when im missed the
only thing you have to offer is my free-
dom

  officials i knew you lied do the
japanese care what happens to a for-
eigner unless he has some mission like
yours you are a liar and a fool i am
not quite ready to leave denshaiko but
even when i go you are to stay here in
the meantime i will have a question or
two to ask and you shall become ac-
quainted with a splendid cell in the rock
which will be your home you will know
then how political prisoners of ours are
treated in that so great america of yours
he clapped his hands

 take him away he screamed in
japanese

  westgaard cried-

  so thats what you are he sprang
directly for the screen his knife out

  there had seemed to be a shadow be-
hind the image of the thunder god
straight through the gods belly west-
gaard slashed a shot roared in the
rocky chamber a heavy falling japanese
leaped from some -hidden compartment
behind a silken hanging to the white
mans back westgaard threw him off
and cursed after this one ejaculation he
said nothing more but fought wildly

 arms were about him his muscles
knotted as he tore away and the knife in
hand hurled the screen aside behind it
was bare wall he had no time to see
where the hidden man had vanished no
time to wonder whether a rock-door was
in the wall he faced about like lightning

  the grit of the blade against bone as
he struck almost turned him sick the
japanese dropped to the floor a thin
stream of yellowish saliva trickling down
his chin

  since the other two immediate at-
tackers had drawn back westgaard had
a moment of respite

  why hadnt he waited what was to
be gained by this senseless onslaught
only one end was possible surely later
there might have been a chance to escape
had the thought of imprisonment in this
rock-shell driven him for the instant
mad just as the actual incarceration
would do even more certainly and cho-
shimu-what of the boy he cried loudly

  stay away choshimu have nothing
to do with me i forced you to come

  a taunting laugh battered from wall to
wall the unknown man was watching
yet in the laugh was something else
anger fear a terrible finality all
three

  westgaard had no time to attempt dis-
section of the uncanny laughter he had
been holding the knife menacingly before
him he moved his hand and a second
shot-from high in the wall-shattered
the blade
the thunder god



  the two japanese advanced together
with little sidewise steps like fighting
crows westgaard watched them warily
each was armed with a knife but neither
seemed anxious to close in

  the mocking voice called

  two to one-two with a knife and one
without i have heard you are a brave
man westgaard show them how to
fight this is better than a show

  the white man did not await the final
dash he stepped forward swiftly and
smashed one of the japanese across the
mouth before either of them could stab
he stepped back as swiftly against the
rock-wall of the room

  blood flowed from the orientals lips

  candle-light tapers hissing softly
crimson silks embroidered with writhing
dragons obscene gods the overturned
ancient screen fallen upon its face
gashed in a right-angled tear the smell
of burned powder unreal-impossible

  high in the chamber a bell sounded
the sweet singing tones changed to me-
tallic thunder in the room of rock

  behind westgaard was a movement
which sent shivers up his spine relent-
lessly he was being pushed forward but
by nothing human an opening door in
the wall behind him was being shoved
outward moving him inch by inch
toward the waiting pair he dared
neither to turn nor to take his eyes from
the assailants before him

  he leaped forward not hopeful hardly
thinking aware that his one feeble
chance lay in dropping both of the knife-
armed japanese and then turning upon
whoever was opening the massive door
he struck once felt the impact of bone
against bone he felt also the sting of
steel tried for a second blow and then
was hurled to the floor under suffocating
stinking bodies

  red flashed before his eyes and he
wondered whether he were just recovering
from the smash received on the lake-path
it must be a dream in another moment
he would awake to find choshimu telling
him that he had stumbled in the dark
from the path and struck his head on the

rocks below a dream the screen was
probably propped against the path be-
side him

  for one fragment of time his eyes
opened he was on the floor half across
the ancient screen of the two gods where
he had slashed the fabric trying to
reach the unknown man the material
was doubled back separated into two
parts-one that made the face of the
screen upon which the gods were painted
and the other that made the heavier
back

  the man with the mocking voice was
crying-

  you see how easy it was after i came
to your assistance

  westgaard kept his eyes fastened on
the inner surface of the screen indelibly
impressed by what he saw as he felt
the room slipping away from him he
actually achieved a grimace-a grotesque
triumphant grin he knew the korin at
last for what it was

ix

westgaard lay in semi-darkness
in gloom which was sulphurous

warm

  a flicker of light from the left sent
wan bars across the rocky floor to his
right in place of wall was a sheer drop
at the end of which-by the sound and
the ascending steam-was boiling water
westgaard rose painfully to his knees
and crept to the edge

  he could see below no more than a
reddish glow like a gigantic eye which
winked open and winked closed again
what he was looking at was not water
but boiling liquid rock the sight of
the molten mass fascinated him

  you will have ample time to reflect
upon the wonders of the world he heard
the same taunting voice say now
however i have several things to ask
you-oh there is no reason for you to
excite yourself i am not in the room
and you can not leap upon me

  westgaard crawled away from the
cauldron and rose to his feet he leaned


sidney herschel small

against the smooth wall the speaker
was in some passage from which a
barred square window let feeble light
into westgaards cell

  several things to ask you the man
repeated i would be interested to
learn where you concealed that knife
but i will not ask you that i would also
be interested to know many other things
but since you are so anxious to study
natural wonders i will get to my business
dear fellow who did you say sent you
here

  i told you but you do not believe me
  and that is all you have to say

  the truth

  do you hear anything american
westgaard listened wind through
the passages no-more than that

if you torture that boy- he choked
just his feet in a boiling pool-that is
all and since he-and you-no longer
have any place to go feet are of no im-
portance

  westgaard felt  each frantic cry of
terror tear at his heart he said suddenly
you cant get anything by torturing
either of us if it is made worth my while
to tell-if you offer freedom as a reward
perhaps i might-

  lie again no you have had your
chance the time will come when even
life in the caves will be preferable to the
way we can kill you am i plain enough
he was westgaard did not answer
you have long legs the man told
him pleasantly we will let you down
an inch or so a day and soon you will
be pleading for life or death

  he heard choshimus cry again then
unexpectedly he began to laugh

  it doesnt work he ventured and
was silent

  the other made a clucking noise

  next time it will for we will not play-
act he said so you guessed that we
were threatening the boy only let us
see how well you can guess next time
the finality of everything began to
work on westgaard he saw now that
only death was before him or that which
was worse than death he stepped aw-ay

from the wall as if facing the end of life
at the present moment if he must die if
choshimu must die better rapidly
quickly

 the map you have been making on
the screen is very clear he said gravely
although his heart was pounding

  silence rewarded him

  the other said at last slowly-

  so you really knew why you came

  and westgaard wished his own words
unsaid

  the man in the corridor had not been
 sure of westgaards errand and now he
 westgaard through a he had blundered
 into what meant absolute death when
 before it might not have happened not
 death and if the man were convinced
 that westgaard really wanted only the
 screen for the a-i to sell not torture

  blundered he had blunder on he must

  do you think i came for the view
he asked and if i do not return to
tokyo in another day in just one day-
those who follow me will also know what
they are after-and who

  you lie

  have it as you will

  it would have been better to have
allowed you to come unmolested

 much better

  the others voice rose

  i thought you might hear something
in denshaiko he said half to himself
it was so easy to have you frightened
away-so very easy

  westgaard said-

  oh we knew what was going on up
here

  you he again none save a few of the
 villagers know of these caves they were
 closed for years none save i in this
 whole land know of the map-so i
 thought but i was afraid some fool
 might say something and a white man
 listens where an oriental minds his own
 affairs

  you have a good organization west-
 gaard suggested

  the man laughed

  i that is not mine oh fool he said
 agreeably i merely turned it to my
the thunder god



purpose a society of young japanese
patriots intent upon keeping art treas-
ures in the country of their origin japa-
nese patriots swearing allegiance to
emperor and sun gods and twenty-legged
turtles and the empire he laughed
again it is safe to tell you the colossal
joke making patriots work for us we
are doing the same thing in china i
laugh every time i think of it

  a second time the alert westgaard
tried an experiment

  it must be dangerous to store ex-
plosives in a place like this

  carefully packed my friend and we
keep them away from the more heated
places in the caves

  you will need to replenish your supply
near the highest tunnel in the railway i
ran across your hiding-place on my way
to denshaiko again westgaard avoid-
ed reference to mamatsu

  you know too much then more
calmly you found it by accident eh
now- mockingly in his usual tone-
if you had the map i have been making
behind the face of the screen you would
know where all of the dynamite is hidden
-where there are rifles-where there are
friends-where-where in fact every-
thing is he began to laugh and we
will be able to exhibit the korin all over
japan by means of our patriotic young
japanese and many will come to see it
and afterwards a man or two will ex-
amine the inside privately and know all
we dare not tell him and at no danger
to any one is it not perfect

  no it was but it isnt now west-
gaard forced himself to speak casually
he recognized the hidden mans desire
to talk to boast almost to confide the
a-i know that they tried to buy the
screen and-if i do not return-failed
how about the copy in the temple

  the unknown answered both questions
they tried to buy it and failed that
is of no importance as to the copy who
ever comes to denshaiko none will
know it is here or is not here and all of
the time the young patriots are cheering
me they will really be assisting me i

have grown so fond of the screen that
when the revolution is over and the red of
the sun flag has spread all over the white
portion of the banner i believe i will take
the screen with me back to russia ah
the patriots

  the aroma of a turkish-tobacco cigaret
drifted across westgaards nostrils it
the fact that the other was smoking
indicated to westgaard that he was very
satisfied with himself there was only
one more thing to try

  i have always hated the capitalists
he suggested meaningly

  the man in the corridor laughed again
even if i believed you you know too
much he retorted there is nothing in
it but for you to remain here until you are
no longer dangerous i am not so certain
now that i shall kill you you are at
least some one to talk with eh these
stinking brown brothers tire me and i am
sick to death of talking to them of gods
and devils of the mountain

  so that was how the red had wormed
his way in

  gods and devils i beat that old
priest at his old game my gods knew
where a couple of gold yen might be
found after i placed them there his gods
were only good to pray to and did noth-
ing for him and so little by little i
gained first their confidence and next their
fear until now they believe i am almost
a god myself

  westgaard said-

  you might give me a cigaret he
lighted what was thrown him the or-
dinary action soothed strengthened him
why didnt you let me get away with the
fake screen

  because it would have made talk when
the real one was exhibited all over the
empire

  but shooting poisoning my absence
-will that make no talk

  for a day a week and then it will
be forgotten and it will be some time
before the screen is ready before all of
our plans are perfect

  who places the explosives so you can
disrupt all traffic


sidney herschel small

  that- and westgaard could almost
see him grin- is no affair of yours but
i tell you this much some few i placed
myself for the experience the rest was
done by many different men and for
many different reasons why i had
some placed in yokohama by a japanese
who is in love with a fat brown nurse in a
hospital and intends with my help to
blow his way into the sleeping-quarters
and then-

  but suppose some one talks

  it would delay us naturally we
have been very lucky however no man
knows of many places that is why we
have the map and when we strike my
friend we strike look at china does
it all seem like a dream to you perhaps
if i told you all i knew you would see-
but i am not going to tell you

  youve already told me enough to
make me see that you are preparing for
success

  a fanatical note crept into the mocking
voice

  success what else first the yellow
and brown nations and then-

  westgaard guessed what he meant
he thought that the red had paused
he decided wisely enough to say nothing
more but heard next the whisper of some
voice in japanese what was said he was
unable to hear no matter how hard he
tried

  who was that fat japanese the red
snapped

  westgaard did not dissemble

  he came here for the water-cure he
said shortly

  he lied if he told you that

  perhaps he did i only met him on
the train

  he lied just as you lied he has not
been near the water he roams around
like an ant in a kitchen who is he
you do not know what does he want
you do not know well- snarling-
we will find that out very shortly i
know where he goes if it makes you any
happier he is near you-but on the slope
of the mountain he said he wanted
exercise bah

  his conversational boasting and con-
fidential mood was gone

  rot die of thirst or jump into the
cauldron he threw at westgaard and
was gone

x

what could a fat japanese do for
him how might mamatsu find
his way through the labyrinth west-
gaard himself did not know exactly where
he was in the caves and why should
mamatsu come after him mamatsu was
some one more the corpulent nipponese
apparently knew of the screen and knew
what he was about but what help was
that to westgaard

  the door was thrown open and choshi-
mu was tossed into the room westgaard
caught him before the boy stumbled over
the edge of the rock-fioor

  they told me that if i hungered i
should eat of your body he sobbed
oh danna-san this is a place of devils
let us go home

  what was he to tell the boy he need-
ed to tell him nothing

  i can die like a man choshimu said
in a thin voice it-it is hard to die
dannc san

  westgaard slipped his arm about the
shaking shoulders

  they were going to throw me into a
pool of steam choshimu told the white
man i cried out and then they all
laughed i can see a little light below
it now choshimu whispered per-
haps there is a way out from that terrible
place

  the cauldron was fully fifty feet below
the rock descending to it was nothing
but concrete volcanic neck smooth
without crack or crevice it actually
sloped away from the cave-shelf where
man and boy were

  it is a jigoku-a hell the boy
mouthed but there is a way out can
even the foam-steam-stay in this
place

  westgaard examined the steam without
interest it did rise cover the far wall
the thunder god



kept away from the cell by the draft of
air through the barred window and slowly
creep down to disappear somewhere near
the molten pool descent however was
impossible the wall was smooth slop-
ing in there was no rock about the
pool the waving surface of half-liquid
half-solid lava seemed to be bottled com-
pletely in rock

  come away from the edge west-
gaard said

  choshimu heard defeat hopelessness
he neither wailed nor whimpered but he
followed westgaard to sit very closely
beside him hopelessness they would
never get out the futility of the situa-
tion the closeness of death slowly rose
to choke the white man

  he felt he supposed as a convicted
murderer must feel he awaited death
but even a murderer was fed up to the
last was given water and even hoped
that some respite was possible he had
been told that they expected a reprieve
a stay of sentence until the warden came
to say-

  im sorry but it is time-

  no reprieve was possible to him he
knew it fully the red would over have
told him anything if he had intended to
let westgaard go it was final choshi-
mu would die first and he would be left
with the dead boys body horrible
there was no day no night the rock-
cell remained semi-black hideous with
blacker shadow and pale streaks of light
choshimu whimpered-

  how long have we been here

  how long indeed minutes hours
more than that westgaard did not
know

  the red would return perhaps and
talk with him again westgaard did not
want to hear him did the other desire
to see him weaken and plead as he
slipped from life there came to him a
swift desire to pray but he did not move
his lips he thought-

  god can do the impossible but why
should i ask him he did not tell me
to come

  no day no night only passing min-

utes on dragging feet passing minutes
darkness and the winking red eye below

  his voice was husky his throat tight
as he said-

  dont be afraid little choshimu
he himself knew fright not terror but
fright

  his arm had gone round the boy re-
mained there frankly the fatalism of
his years in the east began to surge to the
surface if it were ordered it was or-
dered better to face death firmly be-
fore he was weak

  we need only step from the edge he
said as to himself

  choshimu shrank back

if you-hold my hand-when we go-
no not yet mamatsu might some
one might-the red could change his
fanatical mind something could
happen-

  so sanity told him the condemned
man figured in the death cell with the
guards of the death-watch joking with
him with the priest praying while the
hangman saw to his noose minutes
hours through the corridors came the
sweet sound of the little bell

  they pray choshimu whispered
unsteadily how can they asked the
gods to be good when they-

  westgaard said only-

  hush

  the sound of the bell died away

  i regret that i have but one watch
the mockingly pleasant voice called from
the door you have been here an hour
my friend every hour i will come and
tell you the time it will be diversion for
me does the stream make you thirsty
think there is a great lake just outside
a lake filled with cool water if you be-
lieve in morals and you come from a very
moral nation i suggest that this show
you the error of trying to stop a jugger-
naut-the great red chariot of fate
before westgaard could retort the
other was gone

  he laughs at us choshimu said

  he will never laugh at us again
westgaard stood up pulling the boy
gently after him t


sidney herschel small

  it will not hurt baby he said softly
hold to my hand-so close your
eyes a step nearer the pit think of
all the gods who are watching you the
great gods who admire bravery

  blasphemy westgaard did not be-
lieve that it was his head was very
clear he uttered no prayer for himself
it came to him at that moment that there
was a god who cared most for little chil-
dren and who had said- as steam rose
to his face he heard the mocking laugh
again had he swayed forward was he
falling had he stepped from the edge
choshimu with him falling yes but
away from the chasm

  the room shook creaked rock against
rock screamed in agony higher terrible
in tone he heard a human scream a
scream crushed out into mere exhaled
air

  back and forth he swayed near the
pit away from it willy-nilly the floor
of the rock-chamber lurched him flat on
his face choshimu tumbling also the
mountain thundered somewhere in the
caves the echoing cry of kaminari god
of thunder reached westgaards dazed
cars

  once again the floor rose with him
buckling screaming steam from the
cauldron singed his face a shower of
icy water drenched him the cauldron
below hissed and spat and then the
room steadied the screaming died to a
grumbling and at the very end silence

  the-the earth has been tom in the
hands of the thunder god choshimu
breathed

  the rocks seemed still to tremble no
louder than their shiver westgaard heard
a whisper

 i-die rock-rock-rock-

  westgaard for the first time stepped
to the barred window he could see
nothing save that rock had filled the
corridor yet under the mass was a man
the man who had directed their capture

  tell me your name and ill try to get
some one to hear me westgaard pleaded
earnestly

  no answer westgaard was certain

that the other spat he called neverthe-
less

  your master is hurt hes dying
and as the -ing was echoed back at
him he repeated the words in japanese

  no answer westgaard pulled at the
bars and found them set firm in rock
he set himself and tried grimly to move
them

  he died quickly and that is more than
he would have permitted us choshimu
said the boys eyes flashed he died
and he is dead he added

  dont gloat or ill-

  beat me the urchin cried so joy-
ously that westgaard faced about wildly

  the boy could do no more than point
and cry-

  look look

  to the edge of the rock-shelf west-
gaard stepped rock had tumbled down
from above a way-rough terrible-was
ready for their feet the boiling pool had
lowered receded and beside it partially
concealed by the lessening steam was a
fissure through which light filtered how
large the crack was where it led whether
a man might stand on the rocks below
whether a man might even be able to
achieve the lower level westgaard did
not know sudden elation the possibility
of action attempt surged through him
choshimus face as beaming

  we go choshimu howled and began
to scramble down westgaard followed
him at once

  after the smooth creviceless wall the
rocks had appeared possible once on
them the difficulty increased with every
descending step here was a foothold
here no more than a crack in the rock for
a toe

  how long the descent took neither
knew

  rock had been dislodged by the earth-
quake to make a narrow ledge about the
side of the pool nearest the opening along
this man and boy picked their way some
of the rocks were hot but most were of
the regular temperature there was no
way of telling which had been vomited
out of the cauldron which had dropped
the thunder god



from the walls of the empty chimney

  westgaard hope rising half expected
that the widened crack led to the exterior
of the mountain it led merely to a
corridor a passage lighted from some
lower chamber

  along this dim rocky way they walked
rapidly clambering over a pile of rock
which almost blocked the way crawling
where the rock-roof had sunken here
and there other passages ran from the
one they followed westgaard kept
toward the light and finally came to the
room hung with silk and ornamented with
paintings and carvings of the gods

  the first thing he saw was the screen
through a portion of it a rock had hurtled
the wind god was missing entirely torn
from the frame but the second kami-
nari of the thunder held to his bolts his
painted hair streaming his nostrils ex-
panded as if he were breathing powerfully
through them

  from the burning bean-oil lamps west-
gaard guessed that the occupants had
fled hurriedly when the earth shook or
that possibly the russian who was now
dead had been in the room just before
paying westgaard his victim the last
visit his opinion was verified by the
open rock-road by two open doors one
each way

  three doors into the silk-hung room
one through which he had come the other
behind the screen the third must be the
way out while choshimu chattered that
he hurry westgaard peered into the
black void behind the screen next he
stooped for a lamp and stared again

  a dozen rocks had tumbled into the
room he saw-a room partially filled with
crates and boxes some of which bore
the red label of danger

  a second quake-rock on those boxes
of explosives the thought was too
horrible to contemplate and westgaard
wheeled about he cried to the ready
choshimu to have patience and despite
something akin to panic he ripped the
fabric of the screen from the wooden
supports and folded it swiftly with it in
his hand he left the vaulted rock chamber

 xi

his other hand carried the lamp
gusts of alternately warm and chill
air threatened the flame strange grind-
ing noises spurred white man and brown
child they began at last to run slid-
ing down narrow steps rushing pell-mell
along the way

  as they neared the grotto the path
became more difficult westgaard handed
the lamp and fabric of the screen to
choshimu and carried him slowly along
other than shivering the boy made no
sound or movement 

  the two candles were still burning
above the grotto one indeed had gut-
ted out all were close to extinction
fearful japanese westgaard decided
had seized the largest of the tapers as
they fled leaving the remainder almost
consumed

 as he set choshimu on his feet again
the boy wailed bitterly

  the boat the boat is gone
westgaards heart throbbed for a mo-
ment but he was able to say what of
that with seeming nonchalance the
effort cost him something straight to
the edge of the water the man strode
his upper garments were stripped off
before he reached the pool he stood
naked beside it

  the material from the screen he rolled
tightly binding it about with cloth from
his discarded shirt he tied the cylindrical
packet securely to his belt the belt he
slipped over his head and under his right
arm so that it rested across his back and
chest diagonally he arranged it so that
the bundle was at his left shoulder what
happened to the remnant of the screen
was really unimportant now save that
he wanted it life-life was the thing he
intended to fight for

  his white body against the gloom of
the grotto seemed very pale and slender
the light from the high candles touched it
to silver-an image a symbol strength
yes but more-courage

  what the white-bodied man was about
to attempt might be impossible yet he


sidney herschel small

had no intention of faltering his face
was to the low black opening where water
ran into the grotto what currents there
were whether the lake might have a
tide whether the earthquake had blocked
the way-he thought of none of these
outside was the world his hand went
clumsily about choshimu

  you are to hold to this belt so
he told the shivering boy also naked
if you let go no matter what happens
you will be beaten as never before

  i can not swim far the boy mur-
mured

  hold to the belt and you will live
to be beaten westgaard said huskily

  with that he stepped into the water
westgaard did not swim at first but
waded until pressure told him choshimu
was off his feet then slowly he swam
toward the black opening leading out of
the grotto leisurely he paddled into
blackness and turned slowly for the side
he groped for the rope along which the
boatmen had pulled their craft into the
grotto with westgaard the rope was
not there he turned and swam more
rapidly to the other side no rope

  he swam ahead in the dead blackness
and tried the walls again

  panic seized him for a moment and
was passed on to the boy behind him
then with a grunt westgaard turned so
as to face light and grotto he looked up
he saw at once that the rope was really
there and had not been removed by the
fleeing japanese it was there but higher
than he had expected at the right height
for a man kneeling in a boat

  hand over hand he pulled himself and
choshimu farther from the grotto the
swish of the water told him that they
were rounding an angle in the rock

  utten blackness the water was cold
and growing colder

  it was not possible to do other than
drag his and choshimus bodies along
the rope was too high for the water to
lift him to it it took effort effort grow-
ing greater every minute to advance

  westgaard paused but dared not ease
his aching arms by letting go of the rope

in the dark he might flounder about and
never find it again

  his head began to throb anew the
pain proved to him that endurance has a
limit he began to pull himself and his
burden slowly along the rope

 a sudden stream of heated water
seared him and made choshimu wriggle
and cry with pain the unexpected
movement on his back made him loose
one hand to hang by the other desper-
ately fiercely grimly he clawed up-
ward while the muscles in the other arm
fought to raise his body-ah both hands
to the rope again

  no time no breath to chide choshimu
what breath he had was beginning to
come in harsh gurgling gulps he could
go no farther not another inch this
was the end but farther he went

  it made no difference whether eyes
were open or shut the water-tomb was
the same forbidding void blackness
ahead the murk of the grave behind

  his arms no longer had feeling he ad-
vanced still more slowly one pull-one
pull-he couldnt he must

  the water seemed to tear at him with
increasingly savage strength fighting to
drag him from the rope even as he fought
to hold to it choshimu shouted some-
thing to him the subterranean passage
roared and reverberated with the echo
the white man shook the sound from his
deadened ears what the words were he
did not know a hand along the rope a
pull hand along the rope-pull like
pulling on some great bell-cord with
never a sound issuing from the corolla of
bronze perhaps his tired mind thought
a ghost bell in a land of ghosts heated
drops rained down on him but he did
not feel them

  one hand ahead the other hand ahead
over and over automatically over
and over the final grasp to life

  some water-thing cold spineless
whiskered ran from the rope down his
arm to drop with a splash into the in-
visible murk of water a strange sound
began to thrum in his ears mournful
indeterminate minor as the jangle of
the thunder god



samisen was choshimu trying to speak
to him was that bell back in the cavern
ringing or was it imagination what
matter

  cold water over his head shocked him
to sensibility the rope-had it snapped
he tugged fiercely at what his hands still
clung to felt the blessed rope grow taut
but remained under the icy water he
pulled more carefully steadily and as
his body moved ahead he rose almost at
once to the surface

  a staple a fastening not made for
anything save guiding a boat had pulled
out from the weight of two bodies drag-
ging through water choshimu choking
still held to the belt westgaards head
was clear now with grim clarity he
knew that he could go little farther his
arms no longer had feeling each grip
on the rope told him that his fingers held
only because they were shaped talon-
like to the hemp

  yet somehow he still advanced
jerkily slowly sometimes he pulled and
gained not an inch again and again he
was forced to hang limply from the sup-
port while the water tore at his body
he thought soberly-

  if we had jumped into the cauldron
it would have been over in less than a
second

  was he giving up his head was clear
strange things arms and muscles that
they should be so weak so cowardly
the thing to do was to drive them drive
them-but they would not be driven

  sweat from the tremendous effort be-
gan to streak his face to trickle saltily
into eyes and mouth ah just one
more pull arms and another-another

  somewhere in the world workers must
be rising from sleep calling to one an-
other there might even be the sun he
would never see the sun again would
see - see nothing - a void - blackness
the word startled him as he thought of
it not black-gray

  choshimu began to cry horribly at the
same moment

  westgaard knew beyond any doubting
that the hue of the water had changed

that the invisible walls were taking color
substance shape yet he had no en-
durance left no hidden store of energy
nothing bred of exaltation to draw upon
he was tired exhausted choshimus lips
were to his ear

  let me hold the rope and you hold to
me the boy breathed i can not pull
you but after you have rested-

  westgaard gasped his voice strange
and hoarse-

   i should have thought of that before
i tried to tell you but vou would not
listen

  choshimu grasped the rope with eager
fingers westgaard slowly slid down
until he was buoyed by the water he
held to choshimus middle with one arm
and began to beat the other up and down
in the water to rub it back and forth
against his chest he slapped himself
again and again and gradually felt hi
fingers begin to tingle the other arm
he treated the same finally he said-
without you i would have gone no
further choshimu

   could i do less for you after what-
if you begin to blubber great baby
i will beat you here and now it was al-
most light enough to see light enough
surely to determine rock and water
hold to my belt and i will show you
how the seiyojin swim infant

  it was necessary to husband his
strength he swam slowly and steadily
the weariness did not leave him as the
water became fighter but he knew that he
could swim for a long time a sharp angle
in the rock made him almost double upon
himself and then all at once he was in
the outer air

  the moon was wheeling low the air
was gray and somber with the ending of
the night westgaard thought he had
never seen so bright a moon never
smelled such delicious air ground the
last jutting rock he swam an along the
edge of the cliff at the first ledge he
crawled ashore

  he did not want the sun to warm him
to churn his blood alite again it was
enough to stand


sidney herschel small

  im not floating in that tunnel for the
water-rats to eat ive got a body and
its mine a brain and its mine im
alive

  above him he could see a path which
must lead to denshaiko how many
peasants passed along it unaware of the
concealed tunnel the grotto the caves
below choshimu was crying his head
in his arms

  what now the man asked gently

  i-i- the boy turned his face
toward his master i can be brave but
i am hungry he lied valiantly

  we go to the village and-

  westgaard stopped

  the ground beneath him trembled
gently back and forth the easy motion
changed to a terrific heave throwing
both man and boy against the cliff there
was a muffled roar and the earth was
still again

  the god groaned choshimu

  westgaard believed that somewhere
along the cliffs he had seen a flash of red
that flame had spurted up through some
air-vent into the caves

  no he said not the god merely
the implements of those who compete
with him since he spoke in english
choshimu nodded gravely understanding
no word

  a loosened rock westgaard believed
must have dropped on the cases in the
room behind the chamber where the
screen had been he peered below the
jutting rock which had concealed the
entrance into the underground passage
had vanished into the lake no trace
of opening remained the cliffs seemed to
be solid rock again

  we have a story to tell but who will
ever believe us he said aloud

  his body naked white against the
cliffs he started toward denshaiko the
boy trotting behind him he was not
cold only very tired although his eyes
despite the sleepless night were clear
and bright it rather surprized him that
the village blazed with lights every
hut seemed to throw dancing yellow out
into the lake as he walked the bell of

the temple began to beat not peacefully
not regularly but wildly as if in summons

  man and boy began to walk more
rapidly

xii

the priest of the temple was pray-
ing in a room filled to the outer panels
with japanese as he prayed he called
out the names of his people not their
true names but kaimyo-soul names-to
be used only after death a strange
prayer

           koto shiro nushi no kami
           oho icuni nushi no kami

  lamps burned wanly the room was
weary with the deadly pre-dawn the
hour when anything might happen

  you are all to die sosamo told them
in his canking voice i can already see
your souls gathering with white wrap-
pings about their heads koto shiro
nushi no kami i can see the death-
lanterns you have been laboring for
devils what it is you have done i do not
know but you can not fool the gods
they are not old they are always young
they know oho kuni nushi no kami
sit o fools can you hope to run from
the earth kaminari of the thunder will
shake it again and shake it open and you
will all be swallowed into it

  none of you ever worshipped-what
you worshipped elsewhere worshipped
the god in a mountain-shrine mahl
this is his dwelling-place he has no
other i am his priest

  his hand rose steady with excitement
he permitted no further word from any
of the villagers some of whom tried pro-
testation mingled with-the denshaiko
men were peasants from the hills driven
to the temple by the quake

  the god was patient with you
sosamo cried he was patient but at
last he has come

  his voice fainted down like a dying
wind across the lake eye after eye
followed his what they saw sent
tongues cleaving to the roofs of mouths
the thunder god



  the first arrows of the sun had shot
across the lake they touched only one
thing in all that room-the fair hair of a
naked man turning it like the hair of
the god to beaten gold

  about the loins of this apparition-
no man could be so tall-was a bit of
bright silk snatched up before entering
the temple across his chest was a belt
to which was fastened something cylin-
drical shaped like the thunderbolts of
the god himself and his eyes-blue
gold rimmed with red there was no
doubt it was to the overwrought al-
ready frightened japanese nothing of the
world but some messenger from the
throne of heaven possibly even the dread
god himself

 none wanted a second look all
sprang from their knees and rushed wildly
from the temple not until they were
clear of the building did the first terrified
cry rise straight along the lake-path
away from village and mountain the
villagers hurried none brave enough now
for even a backward look

  you even made me wonder for a mo-
ment westgaard heard

  westgaard did not grin

  you still here mamatsu he asked
then as if to himself-

  made it

  mamatsus eyes were bulging his
lips worked but he said never a word
the ancient priest was on his knees

  i have seen a miracle he whispered
his head buried in the sleeves of his kimo-
no to shut out the vision a miracle
after all these years a miracle

  leave him to his visions mamatsu
breathed to the white man let us go
where i can find you food clothing it
will be only a kimono and will cover you
but half gods of heaven westgaard-
san your feet are in ribbons

  they left the priest on the floor crying
with joy choshimu was sitting wearily
outside the temple

  did you drive them all out danna-
san he asked they ran as if the
devils were after them

  mamatsu smiled at the boy

  i see you know the powers of your
master he said

  mamatsu entered the first house that
he came to that was more than a hut he
pulled drawer after drawer out of cup-
boards until he found under and over-
kimonos for the white man while the
japanese blew up the brazier and set
about boiling water for tea westgaard
washed and bandaged his feet with the
bandages in place he bound on straw
sandals choshimu rapidly recovering
but heavy with sleep now paraded about
in a silk kimono too large for him

the cushions were soft west-
gaard stretched out on them luxur-
iously food had been eaten many cups
of scalding tea consumed a cigaret from
mamatsus packet fumed between his
fingers

  now the plumjf japanese said the
story

  why are you still here westgaard
asked

  mamatsu shrugged

  what else was there for me to do he
countered i hoped to reach the lower
villages before you there is another
steeper path unused save by wood-cut-
ters sosamo-san told me of it you
were right i wanted the screen also
but- looking into westgaards eyes-
not as an object of art

  westgaard said thoughtfully

  youll never believe what i tell you
and i am not certain it is wise to talk of
what ive seen but ill tell you this
mamatsu the screen of the temple
would have done you no good

  is it so mamatsu dropped his
cigaret into the brazier and lighted a
second before repeating is it so

  then what i sought was concealed in a
copy

  in the original i want to talk well
enough but it depends a great deal upon
who hears me ive not lied except to
say that i knew about volcanoes i work
for the a-i but you

  mamatsu sat silently

  if you know what i came for and


sidney herschel small

what i hoped to find concealed in the
screen you can guess my business well
enough

  you are one interested in retaining
valuable and ancient art-objects in
japan

  mamatsu retorted

  that is how we first became suspicious
of the business i art i am more
interested in a new way to cook turtles
you know who i am

  slowly westgaard entirely convinced
even though the other showed no ornate
badge gilded with the seal of the empire
began to talk again and again mamatsu
interrupted him with

  they have got as far as that and
a scheme of the devil and it seems
foolish but look what they do in china
those reds and at the very end what
a thing that was through the rock
tunnel

  westgaard concluded with-

  ive got the fabric from the screen
names places are they both on
it

  westgaard said

  both but the plans were not com-
plete thats why-

  i understand it all-all and now i
will not be able to breathe until i get
both the material and yourself into
tokyo soberly you were a foil for
me my friend all eyes were upon you
once you started for denshaiko it en-
abled me to go unnoticed he looked
thoughtful i wonder if that was the
intention

  if my people sent me knowing what it
was i really should get what it meant-
if they knew you were going also-
what then

  westgaard smiled wearily

  i will wait until im back in an a-i
office before deciding he said

  choshimu had rolled himself in a futon
and fed was snoring bravely on the
matting

  are you not sleepy mamatsu asked
yes i suppose that i am but-
smiling- im as anxious to get away
from here as you are

  it will be a trick getting through
the railway town mamatsu agreed
they-these mealy-mouthed young pa-
triots who are tools or more than tools
for all we know-will be waiting for you
they will know nothing of what has hap-
pened here unless the villagers keep
running all that distance you had bet-
ter give the screen to me no well
we go together now good and we
will go by the shorter way

  he stood up

  i do not need my bags he said i
have slept without sleeping-clothes be-
fore and while i am fat i am stronger
than you might think he stooped and
picked up the sleeping boy i will carry
him and when i tire you can help come
let us go before the village-fools return

  as they passed the temple he began to
chuckle

  the priest is still praying he laughed
you will go down into history as a
miracle

  mist rose from the lake curling about
the base of the cliffs like pink lotus-
petals peaks and cones were bathed in
sunlight

  take your last look at the mountain
that you came to examine mamatsu
continued still smiling ai-ya you
examined it better than you thought
you gods of heaven and earth what have
we now

  even before they heard the roar they
saw that which seemed unbelievable

  the highest peak of the mountain was
lifted bodily from its foundations was
flung into myriad fragments and hurled
into the air explosion followed ex-
plosion clouds of steam shot into the air
with thunderous noises pitchy darkness
followed instantly by warm rain and
then toward them a ghastly torrent
tearing down the steep sides of the
mountain

  neither man moved both stood stock-
still choshimu in mamatsus arms did
not stir

  it seems we are to die the japanese
whispered

  the top of the mountain had been torn
the thunder god



up by the roots the sun had been blot-
ted out

  i have heard that jisshin precedes
eruption the japanese muttered i
did not remember this is an earth-
quake land-ahhh

  down the side of the mountain the
mass of rock mud lava tore a rock
dropped near them a second hurled
high from the vent smashed into the
lake westgaard looked swiftly around

  stand against the tree-trunk he
ordered be no good but better than
in the open

  close to the tree the two men stood
eyes only on the descending torrent

  black slimed with the green of molten
mineral the mass hurtled down the side
of the mountain rocks from above
began to splash steadily into the lake
catapulted boulders crashed down like
terrible rain through the trees searing
the grass to brown near where they fell
the earth beneath them seemed to
smoke to writhe in pain

  neither man spoke there was no
longer anything to say the futility of
his earlier escapes beat upon westgaard
he was glad that choshimu slept ma-
matsus words rattled gurglingly

  look devils of hell look

  the flow had neared the lake at a
huge projecting peak it seemed to hesi-
tate to waver to rush back upon itself
pile high all along its front then with
new force it swerved to the right found
new gullies and torrented ahead away
from the village away from the fascinated
men

  a cloud of steam streamed up from
the lake as the first of the flow reached it
grayness heat stench the hiss of steam
encompassed the entire valley

   it was no longer possible to see clearly
what was happening as westgaards
eyes strained a rush of water poured
over him drenchingly before he could
do more than grasp the tree water was
over his head water first cold then
tepid

  roaring was in his ears his arms were

   earthquake

   

about mamatsu and about the tree also
the fingers of one hand clawed into the
japanese skin mamatsu seemed to be
trying to pull away to rise to the surface
but the white man fought to keep them
all where they were his lungs began to
ache his head to ring

   should he let go and rise to the surface
the surface of-what what was be-
coming of the lake

   air instant like rising to the surface
although he was still clinging to the trunk
of the tree mamatsu was gasping
choshimu was wailing that he dreamed of
terror and could not awake

  the lake there was no lake only
a wide streaming river which flowed away
from the mountain and toward the vil-
lage of denshaiko toward and through
it the crest of the temple stood above
the water there was nothing else far
to the right where once had been a
forest and a forest-path were bare
blazing stumps around which swirled
yellow-green-brown rivers of mud

  we-saw-the making-of the earth
mamatsu stammered spitting water
and we-live to tell of it he plumped
down squarely on his knees dropping
choshimu i will never doubt the gods
again

  the air was lighter above the moun-
tain visible again was a gigantic steam-
cloud behind that the blue of the sky

  it was in westgaards mind to tell
mamatsu that he was praying because
his own life had been miraculously
spared but a glance at the japanese
intent face kept the words from is
suing

  he had been tired before and exhaust-
ed he believed now that he had previous-
ly reached the limit of thought and en-
durance the debacle left him still
cold almost entirely unshaken he had
made his fight for life in the tunnel this
was accident luck the other had been
different

  we must try to find the path the
priest spoke about he said placing a
hand on mamatsus shoulder

  yes the path mamatsu shuddered

the one we came here on-the one the
villagers took-thats gone

  westgaard repeated-

  gone

  he knew that the men who had been
on it were gone also but even this did
not shock him he had seen too much
experienced too much already

  masses of hot rock smoking jagged
blocks of lava had completely dammed
the lake less than a quarter-mile from
where they had been standing the
level of the water had been raised until
the path was a scant foot above the newly-
formed river where the escaping waters
rushed after tearing over denshaiko
westgaard did not know cliffs on the
far side had disappeared entirely

  it was impossible to recognize the
lake the once verdant valley for what it
had been what had been cool placid
lake had been turned into a devil-play-
ground filled with erupted material
possibly flawed and raised by the action
of the earth now it resembled the giant
building-blocks of fiends offspring

  neither caucasian nor oriental had
been able to keep track of time how
long the actual eruption had lasted they
did not know how long they stood
watching they did not know time had
stopped

  sosamo knew mamatsu said at
last he said the villagers were to die
and they are dead

  not until the three were on the
drenched path leading away from the
former village did the pudgy japanese
return to reality

  we will not be stopped nor ques-
tioned in yasudo now your business
my affairs have certainly been forgot-
ten whoever in yasudo was inter-
ested in the screen has other things to
think about it has been many years
since the mountains here spat fire it
will be simple for us to take the train and
return

  he walked ahead glancing from time
to time toward westgaard

  what is the saying in your land
he asked abruptly that it is an awful

earthquake which accomplishes only
damage

  westgaard nodded recognizing the
japanese fight for the commonplace for
control

  as they started down the path
choshimu cried-

  i see nothing of the temple-only
water

  mamatsu choked out-

  we should have brought the priest
with us

  if death had taken sosamo while he
was still in ecstasy over the imagined
miracle the priest had died happily
curious that the money paid for the
fraudulent screen could never do any
good to either priest or temple west-
gaard had paid for the korin he had it
strapped against his skin curious the
venture must be over nothing re-
mained save to stir the dregs

the offices of the a-i in tokyo
are as like those in osaka as two peas
they are high above the street tele-
phones connect them with the outside
world in their filing-cases are letters and
orders typewriters click and adding-ma-
chines whirr clerks make endless trips to
the water-jugs

  mamatsu had wired his own chief from
a station along the line arranging for a
meeting in the a-i offices he had merely
telegraphed him to be at the asiatic-im-
port the following morning he made no
mention of westgaard or of the screen
to westgaard at the time of sending the
message he remarked that one never knew
who read telegrams and that he had not
the patience to code a wire

  after sending the telegram he had
bought for westgaard the largest kimono
to be found together with the hugest pair
of shoes the white mans feet were so
cut that footgear other than straw sandals
over fresh bandages were impossible even
had the shoes been large enough

  westgaard had been certain that sleep
on the train was not to come but with
the thunder god



mamatsu sitting beside him he had slept
through the night to awake refreshed he
had eaten with relish and as they were
finally whirling toward the a-i in a taxi
his lips puckered to a noiseless whistle
he said to mamatsu-

  wonder what happened to the imita-
tion screen

  the japanese shrugged

  gone he said it is no longer of any
importance

  the officials of the a-i were waiting in
force for westgaard carstairs sum-
moned from osaka grasped westgaards
hand even sanderson the old man
clapped him on the shoulder

  we thought youd been killed until
mr ogawa and his friends told us of the
wire they received whered you get the
outfit andy they tell me denshaikos
wiped out you must have run for it
eh

  denshaikos gone it was pretty
close charley

  mamatsu was whispering to ogawa at
his words all of the japanese sucked in
their breaths excitedly their eyes glis-
tened as they watched westgaard

  ive lost a bet on you sanderson
stated bet mr ogawa that youd get
the korin screen for them they wanted
it for a museum told him youd never
fallen down on anything but im damned
if i call this falling down fellow isnt re-
sponsible for eruptions and id still be
willing to bet youd have bought the
screen or stolen it im glad youre back
andy mighty glad and the bet can be
called off or not thats how glad i am
he made a noise in his throat you
know what im trying to say he sputtered
westgaard said gently-

  you dont lose charley youre
lucky you win ive got the screen
but i wish youd told me what you wanted
it for-really

he didnt know carstairs said
harrison from yokohama asked
wasnt it for a museum i heard
down my way that some old die-hard
wouldnt sell-was afraid of whatd hap-
pen-

  what difference did it make who we
wanted it for sanderson said uneasily
i dont understand

  your company knew only what we
told them ogawa interrupted we
told them as much as seemed wise at the
time

  westgaard felt no resentment

  i was to get the bullets and mamatsu
the screen

  he didnt blame them possession of
the hidden map was japans business to
get it they were willing forced to use any
means any possible means he did not
see clearly why both mamatsu and him-
self had not been told

  you could have trusted us he said
gravely

  we have been afraid to trust any one
a japanese named setayama stated if
you knew what we know what we fear-

  westgaard could guess well enough

  the police caught a man whod been
in the building across from my office
carstairs piped earnestly he was merely
looking through the place with an idea to
rent didnt know the offices were al-
ready leased didnt have any gun on
him he represented some foreign com-
pany good financial standing i talked
to him never saw him before of course
the police let him go

  westgaard said-

  naturally bill ogawa he believed
winked gravely at him and he winked in
return

  bill told me about that foolishness-
the shooting sanderson said acci-
dents will happen andy

  westgaard looked at the japanese
several of them were busy examining the
blank wall but ogawa met his eyes
squarely

  it is only fair that you tell what you
know ogawa decided please let it
go no further than this room gentle-
men

  westgaard began by addressing car-
stairs

  i suppose i was spoiling for excite-
ment bill he started the notion of
the old man sending me on a silly errand


sidney herschel small

after the confounded quiet up in my dis-
trict was the last straw his voice low-
ered he spoke soberly in monotone in-
articulate at first he slowly became fluent 
he painted them a picture he could hear
the japanese hiss hear the white men
grunt he watched sandersons right hand
creep from his knee to his chin when he
told them of the water-passage sander-
sons fingers tightened about his jaw pull-
ing the upper face into slantwise wrinkles

  and thats what happened he ended
softly

  they-they nearly killed you san-
derson muttered

  khledhim mamatsu snapped they
killed him again and again but he did not
have sense enough to know it could you
or i get through that passage would we
have done what he did were we ever
taken for a god there has never been
anything like it since the sun goddess sent
the sacred crow flying through the vapors
of hell he groaned and all you say
is they nearly killed you

  westgaard did not say it wasnt any-
thing it was something he was not
elate but he felt the warmth of satisfac-
tion he had done the job

  we knew there were once caves at
denshaiko setayama said that is
there is a legend about them now mr
westgaard if you are not too tired tell
me what the russian looked like

  i never saw him that was one of the
horrible things-to be killed by a man
whose face you have never seen id
know that voice of his-but hes dead
you can be very sure of that

  dead as last years blossoms ma-
matsu agreed

  westgaard pulled open his kimono un-
buckled the belt untied the roll of fabric
the hair of the thunder god still gleamed
water had not affected the ancient gilt
neither had the fabric itself darkened

  they knew how in the old days
ogawa remarked as he spread the ma-
terial out on a desk korin was a great
artist he hesitated before separating
the face from the reverse of the two fabrics
if only that russian used good inks

  the russian had eyes gloated over
the map

  we will examine the indicated places
ogawa said cheerfully one after an-
other we will draw the wasps stings
what a plan after china japan can
you see us crippled our railways blown
up our docks destroyed our barracks
hurled to heaven you have done some-
thing for us mr westgaard no matter
how we reward you it will not be enough
we-

  may i remind you that i failed where
westgaard-san succeeded that he went
to the depths and back again for some-
thing of no concern to him that-

  you need not be afraid for your
friend ogawa chided as for your hav-
ing failed you did the best you could
he smiled no reward would be ade-
quate but we can at least give you some-
thing round beribboned of gold which
any japanese would give his life for i do
not speak of money but you will at least
have enough to pay you for a coat and
trousers he folded the map and thrust
it into an inside pocket you are tired
all i can say is thank you

  one of the japanese unlocked and
opened the door outside of it stood an-
other japanese obviously on guard cho-
shimu tugged at westgaards sleeves the
boy tried to whisper but his voice car-
ried-

  his eyes danna-san his eyes

  for unmeasurable time the eyes of the
japanese at the door wavered into west-
gaards eyes definitely crossed what
westgaard saw in them sent the white
man leaping across the office to pin the
other to the floor mamatsu was but a
jump behind him

  westgaard was insisting oblivious to his
surroundings his hands on the others
throat

  tell me why you tried to kill me at the
station tell me

  mamatsu however was tearing the
captives clothes apart and let out a tri-
umphant howl

  no wonder it was known about west-
gaard i told you ogawa that we had a
the thunder god



leak in our own office mah this is no
patriot westgaard what does he care
for art or art treasures here is his art
he spat the japanese equivalent for
judas

  the purse next to the meins skin was
thick bulging with new hundred-yen
notes

  harada knew mr westgaard was go-
ing setayama stated softly he did
not know mamatsu was to go he will
find that his knowledge and lack of it will
both prove expensive take him away
mamatsu

  mamatsu bowed and jerked the fearful
harada to his feet

  it will be a pleasure he said he
bowed to westgaard i failed and you
succeeded but- poking a finger into the
unprotesting guilty man-i am to have
a little fun of my own it seems there is
a thing of two about other miscarried
plans i will ask this dog i will see you
before you depart westgaard-san good
we can talk of-no not volcanoes i
never want to hear of them again-well
of how i am to lose my fat

  when he shoved harada away and the
door had been closed again ogawa said
to his companions-

  that is how the news leaked out

  it was westgaard who nodded

  im glad you didnt realize what was
up he said to sanderson

  there was silence and ogawa rose to
leave

  you have done a great thing for us
he said to westgaard

  in westgaard was pride of accomplish-
ment pride of race

  glad to have done it he said simply

when the a-i clan were alone save
for choshimu who was proud of his
final share sanderson announced

  this is a feather in the a-is cap yes

sir andys done a great thing for us he
coughed choked down words with diffi-
culty blinked and then was unable to re-
frain from saying got something to tell
you-got idea fr you-want-need-man
like-like-oh bosh lets got th club
an get a drink

  westgaard discovered that sandersons
obvious intention to advance him high in
the a-i organization left him almost un-
moved the promised decoration and re-
ward to come from ogawa also seemed
without meaning he supposed he would
get immense satisfaction from all of them
later

  but now-now he was alive

  despite the office in which he sat cave
eruption black passage denshaiko were
all near to him his body had sufficient
strength his will the power to fight for
existence fate had entered into the mat-
ter but he had been able to take advan-
tage of it good to be alive-better to
have made a good fight for life what had
happened might fade into the drab pat-
tern but now it was very real

  where do we go choshimu woke
him for your new clothes

  not yet impatient one why
  angrily

  can i be proud of a danna-san who
looks like a scarecrow not even a tem-
ple-sweeper has feet in rags all of these
danna-san who are not half as important
as you have clean faces but yours is
bristly like a pigs back every one in
the street will laugh at you and when
they laugh i will-

  westgaard looked at the earnest face
we have had enough fighting baby
he said another word about it and i
will truly beat you

  the men of the a-i inner council were
waiting hand in hand with high heads
the tall white man and the little japanese
boy followed them out of the room

a free-to-all meeting-place for headers writers and adventurers

a query about the possible use of a
gun without a trigger in one of
walter j coburns recent stories brought
the following reply

  personally i never saw a man use a gun with no
trigger but ive heard old timers who knew the
west in the early days discuss the business of gun
fanning according to them a gun man had little
use for a trigger on a single action colts six-gun
of frontier or bisley model he thumbed his gun
hammer with the trigger pulled back thus uniting
the two movements of cocking and trigger pulling
thereby saving a precious fraction of a second
some of those gun-fanners so i have been told on
the authority of old timers filed the trigger com-
pletely off and used only the hammer

  they thumbed the hammer or fanned it with
the heel of their left hand if they were right
handed i have seen a gun fanned with the rapid-
ity of an automatic in the last named manner the
trigger pulled back during the operation the
shooting was accurate and from a point near the
waistline-walt coburn

the author of the leading story in
this issue-it is not his first-rises
to introduce himself to camp-fire

  i am an ex-major of the cavalry of the regular
army of some twelve years service i dont take the
title very seriously except as a defensive measure
against the flock of military titles now to be found
in every business office so that one is continually
under the necessity of paying his rent to a captain
his insurance premium tq a major and his gas bill
to a colonel one can only hope that these prefixes
will not become hereditary or transferable by
marriage as in kentucky where a man who marries
a colonels widow assumes as well the title of the
late lamented

  my not being in the army today i ascribe to the
possession of a battered old typewriter and enough
previous newspaper training to make me facile in
its use on this wrecked and sorry object i ham-

mered out polemics diatribes monographs and
all manner of advice and criticism for the im-
provement of the american regular army inci-
dentally i hammered out a book on cavalry organi-
sation and training and tactical use which i have
to date been asked to permit four foreign general
staffs to translate and use the american cavalry
does not know it but they are today conforming to
my suggestions as to the organization and use of
cavalry machine guns which makes a fair score for
the battered old typewriter aforesaid

  but alas this wrecked old object led me into hot
water i was compelled by it to announce to a
startled war department that the regular army
seemed to lack that firm hold on the affections of
the american civilian that would result in an
efficient national defense i brazenly suggested that
the army was governed in accordance with a lot of
outworn aristocratic principles which we had in-
herited two centuries ago from the british and the
prussians pointing out that a system intended for
the military governing of peasants by aristocrats
was somewhat antiquated for our big middle class
nation i suggested that an ill-fitting collar resulted
in an unwilling horse and that o heresy of heresies
it was easier to change the collar than the horse in
my magnanimity i went even further and offered
to outline a system that would correct these evils
pointing modestly to the official records which
showed that a had commanded a succession of
competition winning record breaking organiza-
tions and offering to let the entire army in on the
means by which such results had been secured

  imagine the effect of a tiger in a young ladies
seminary and you can gather something of the
effect made by the impact of a new idea on the war
department rudyard kipling wrote me i ad-
mire your pluck but i have never seen an army re-
formed from within came the dawn and i found
myself hurled into the delights and struggles of civil
life but i might add the last chapter of the story
has yet to be written

the discussion about the use of
blow guns by north american in-
dians brings comments from two people
who ought to know-an indian and an
indian expert well hear from the former
first

  dear friends at camp-fire in your issue of
august th there is a letter from comrade lueien
beckner about the use of blow guns in north
america i will tell you what i know of their use
among the iroquois nation i am part oneida
clan of the wolf have lived most of my life among
white men and in my early childhood remember my
father using a small cane gun much like a bean
blower in the woods a small dart shaped from
hickory or other hard tough wood with points made
from stone bone and sometimes of iron were used
they were used for quick close shots in wooded
sections where it was very essential to make no
noise and the range was short but i can remember
a shot of about one hundred feet that my father
made and pierced through a rabbits head with
almost instant death to it

  my grandfather told me of the use in his boy-
hood of such guns for hunting which was then very
popular with youths before they were capable of
joining war-parties

  i came back to the reservation about five years
ago to find there was no more oneida reservation
forty miles east of here so i have made my home
here at onondago reservation but even here the
continued encroachment upon the indians continue
and if the iroquois nation lives it will be only by the
aid of our few remaining white friends

   i am slightly familiar with a few of the old indian
games and of weapons and if i can assist in giving
you facts of them i will be glad to do so-chief
logan

 and now some words from arthur
woodward of a a who started it all

  it would appear that friend lucien beckner
whose camp-fire letter is in the august  issue is
inclined to take issue with me re the poisoned blow-
gun dart in north america there is a chance of
course that in the pre-columbian era there were
poisoned darts used in the blow guns of our southern
tribes but so far my research has failed to bring to
light any historic record supplanting such a theory
however anything is possible and it is said that in
the old days there were some of the southern tribes


adventure

who placed poisoned thorns in the trails when
pursued by enemies from the north but as to
poison on the darts quien sabe beckners guess is as
good as any however a word or two regarding
those tiny chipped points which he is convinced
were never meant for a large game killing arrow i
wonder if he ever saw a cane arrow with a hard wood
foreshaft if he did and it was from the right
location then he would be speedily convinced that
not only were those exquisitely chipped heads used
on regular man-sized arrows but that they were
used on all sorts of game from rabbits to man

  it so happens that there are two types of
arrows used by our aborigines of both north and
south america one of these is the single piece
arrow usually made of some light tough wood and
either pointed with stone latterly metal or glass
bone ivory thorns shell copper deer antler cane
or no point at all some of these shafts are about a
foot long maybe a few inches over and others range
about four feet in length the second type is that
having a cane shaft with a hard wood foreshaft
whipped into the cane with either a sinew or native
fibre wrapping the foreshaft is often pointed in
the case of the southwestern peoples apache to
dieguene of california with delicate little fingernail-
size heads of flint obsidian crystal quartz chalce-
dony chert or any other of those easily chipped but
keen cutting btones

  often these points have the two base tangs larger
than the body and point of the arrow so that when
the head is mounted in the slit of the foreshaft the
base tangs project a bit on either side of the wood
and the point is almost buried in the lashing of
sinew and bitumen or glue whiehever the case may
be however such a shaft is capable of deep
penetration because the foreshaft much less in cir-
cumference than the main shaft and of very hard
wood plus the fact that it is tipped with a razor like
bit of stone in effect the entire foreshaft which
may range from an inch and a half to seven or eight
inches and in the case of the big boys from the tribes
of south americas jungles to over a foot in length
is an arrow head

  some of the south american peoples do not tip
these foreshafts at all but make them about the size
of a lead pencil with a groove cut near the sharpened
end and the groove sometimes filled with poison
when the shaft strikes home the length of the cane
drags it downward and the pencil point of wood
snaps off leaving the poisoned end in the wound
in addition to the hard wood points those of thin
cane broadof blade are fastened to the foreshaft
with sometimes a pinch of the poison secreted in
the base of the curve of the head where it is lashed
on with native cord then too some of the heads
from south america are sharpened bone lashed to
the foreshaft at an angle in such a fashion as to form
a barb good fish arrows and another word in
regard to the so-called tiny bird-points which are
supposed to have been used solely for the killing of
birds most indians preferred to kill the birds
without breaking the flesh or spotting the plumage
with blood accordingly bird arrows are often

and were often made with knobby blunt heads or
if pointed at all had two small cross sticks bound
near the point so there would be just sufficient pen-
etration to bring the bird down yet prevent the
shaft following through into the body at times
these heads would be made of the leg bones of small
animals or large birds

speaking again of the blow gun and its use by
forest tribes only mainly that is true but one
must also remember that those same tribes also
have the bow and the arrow and in fact rely more
on that weapon than the blow gun a slight twig
or a breath of wind will deflect a light sliver of a
dart and even by these tribes habitually using the
blow gun it can only be used effectively where the
foliage is open    and they were never long dis-
tance weapons for that matter neither were the
bows and arrows of the indians for contrary to the
popular beliefs the indians were not the long
distance marksmen that fiction writers would have
us think an indian would sooner waste an hour
or so stalking to get a close up shot at an animal or
bird than risk an open shot at one hundred yards
close in however his arrows rarely failed to drive
home    they had to or mr man went hungry
and he thought as much of his belly as we do of
ours in south america where the arrows are
prodigious things long cane shafts long foreshafts
and long cane blades for heads with long feathering
the range must necessarily be short they are in
effect spears launched from huge bows the bows
themselves are in the main of hardwoods and some
six to seven and a half feet in length

  again referring to the possible use of the arrow
heads on blow gun darts i for one cannot see how
they could be used a maximum of lightness is
desired where a blow gun dart is concerned it must
be remembered that it is only a puff of air that
speeds a dart on its way and the feathering used
is either thistledown southern states or native
raw cotton south america a stone head however
small would be too heavy for effective shooting 
have never seen a blow gun dart with any sort of a
head on it and i am not exaggerating when i say i
have seen hundreds of them not only in their cane
quivers but those from a native store wrapped in
palm leaves ready to be dipped in the poison gourd
and tufted with cotton in south america the
darts are carried untufted as a rule until they are
needed then a pinch of cotton is taken from the little
gourd or basketry receptacle that is attached to the
short length of cane serving as a quiver and with a
skillful twist wrapped about the butt of the dart
the point is smeared with the fresh curare poison
inserted in the barrel of the gun and phut its
gone	-------

as i explained before the cherokee used to gather
the thistledown arrange it in wheel shaped
bunches and later affix the tufts to the shafts of the
slender pine darts which are very light these
darts resemble in appearance crude swabs the
guns those made of the cypress and pitched over
the camp-fire



the outside to prevent air leakage resemble some-
what those used in south america but have not
the elaborate mouth pieces nor sights that grace
the long tubes from the southern continent

  well maybe this has cleared things up for friend
beckner maybe not but them are the facts oh
yes regarding the siouan people who moved out
to the plains country their knowledge of the bow
went with them although there is a band of teton
dakota known as the sans arcs or no bows
which tradition saith were at one time lacking that
important weapon which may or may not be the
reason for the name it might just as well be that
some poor duffer who had a large family lost his bow
on a hunt and was dubbed a sans arc or rather a
no bow cant recall what the dakota term for
the no bow is at the present moment such things
are hard to trace and one can only take the deriva-
tions as they are given and take a pinch of salt with
them it is also quite likely that the shortened form
of the bow used by the dakota came about gradu-
ally through the th century to date because they
did not get horses until along in the early half of that
century or it may have been even later accounts
vary

  there i reckon that winds it up if any one else
has a bone or two to be gnawed let him toss them
into the circle and well growl over them a bit-
arthur woodward

this seems to be a pretty good test of
the number of words in the eskimo
vocabulary

  what started this is the letter from mr t t
waterman to mr solomons re the vocabulary of
the eskimo

  now mr solomons should know and from what i
know of him he does know and from my own obser-
vations of that bundle of fat good nature he has a
very limited vocabulary the eskimo not mr
solomons

  to illustrate a point at one time i ran a small
stem wheeler on the porcupine river from fort
yukon to the headwaters of the old crow river
of course the natives in this part of the country are
not eskimos but a few of these people drift over the
mountains from herchall island one day i had
the pleasure of having as a passenger bishop stringer
of the anglican church now the good bishop had
spent the greater part of his life administering to the
spiritual needs of the natives of the arctic coast as
far as bailey island and is as good an authority on
the eskimo as any

  he was engaged in translating the bible into
eskimo and was making very heavy weather of the
job on account of the limited vocabulary

  another thing that i know from my own observa-
tions is that one word may be used in many places
and that he has spliced out his language with many
words of an allied tongue

  bishop stringer is one of the very few missionary
teachers that is well liked in the north and is man

enough to hold up his end of the trail with the best
of them while on the trip he shocked the combined
mate cook and deckhand we carried nick
cooked lunch and came up to relieve me at the wheel
so i could eat after finishing i went back in the
wheel house and had hardly settled down to a long
stretch of work when nick came back his eyes pop-
ping out of his head what do you think that
minister is washing the dishes thats the kind of
a bird stringer is-francis rotch

rank c robertson whose
story the long striker started the
discussion of the relative skill of aus-
tralian and american sheep-shearers
passes on to us a pertinent clipping from
an australian paper which was sent to
him by an australian comrade walter
wallace the paper in which the article
appeared was the sydney new south
wales sun

how many men can say that they have shorn a
million sheep or anything approaching it
yet harry oates who gave evidence at the federal
arbitration court in sydney last week has put up
a tally of well over half a million in his  years of
shearing

  harry oates a tall powerfully-built man of 
began shearing at the age of  he has shorn in
new zealand as well as over a great part of aus-
tralia his best tally for one day was  sheep
shorn in eight hours and  minutes and under or-
dinary shearing conditions

  this is not a record of course but it is good going
harry oates knew a shearer who once shore 
sheep in a day and did not jack howe put up a
worlds record with  using the blades

  oates has approached  at other times but he
says that his form began to decline a little after he
passed his th birthday his best tally was made
at  when he had been eight years a shearer yet
last year he went up to  and his average was bet-
ter than any shearer whom he met in any shed

  he was described in the court as one of the very
best shearers in australia taking both quality and
quantity into account

  to shear  sheep in a day of eight hours and 
minutes means that each sheep is shorn in an aver-
age in under two minutes

  it would also mean at the present shearing rate
that the shearer would earn over d a minute or
 s a day indeed from the money point of view
harry oates was born a little too soon when he
began shearing  years ago the rate in nsw was
 a hundred now it is twice that

  in these days oates works at sheds in nsw and
victoria he does not wander so far afield as he once
did the season consists of  weeks of shearing and
 of crutching

  shearing is going on almost all the year round in


adventure

australia somewhere or other but few men follow
the sheds right through shearing often begins in
may in the sheds of western queensland it fol-
lows the seasons down through the continent

  at the end of the year shearing is still going on in
the colder districts of victoria and of tasmania in-
deed some belated sheepmen are still shearing in
january or even february these however are
usually small flocks of little interest to the profes-
sional shearer

  oates is a tall man and some shearers hold that
this is no advantage for the shearer has to stoop
over his work almost from start to finish and of
course the taller he is the more he has to stoop
in any case oates holds that shearing is not a job
for an old man the shearer works at high pressure
throughout the day he needs not only strength
but suppleness

  and while the modern machine shearer may not
have to exercise quite as much strength as the blade
shearer and has perhaps not quite as much strain
on the wrist he has to stand the vibration of the
machine

  there are of course still millions of sheep in aus-
tralia shorn with the blades most owners of com-
paratively small flocks do not consider it worth
while to put in the machines then stud sheep are
usually shorn by hand and there are one or two big
stations where the owners still stick to the blades

  with the concertina type of merinoes once
popular with many flock-owners the sheep with
huge folds of skin standing out in wrinkles the
blades have a marked advantage over the machine-
shears it is easier to run down the wrinkles this
type of merino has however now largely gone out
of fashion most breeders favor the plain-bodied
merino

  shearing is one of the many things in which
australia has put up worlds records one hears
singularly little of shearing performances in the
other great sheep countries of the world-the argen-
tine the united states russia south africa north
africa

  in algeria by the way they shear the sheep in
the ornamental fashion called in the old blade days
ribbing and quartering if one may judge by
the photographs it looks very nice with the wool
left in ridges which make fancy designs but it docs
not make for fast shearing

  it does not appear however that the shearers in
any of these countries equal the australian records
though there are good shearers in the argentine and
in western usa

  some day perhaps we will have an international
shearing match it would be safe to back australia
against the world

the following speaks for itself

i	am glad to pass wm mcknights
poem on to you

  i give this poem to you as tribute to your maga-
zine adventure-editors readers business men-

and all who have made it possible in appreciation
of the sheer perfection within it especially that
thread of fineness running all through it i would
call sheer manhood so inspiriting in a fatuous
age jaded already in its self-convinced superiority-
wm mcknight

the wanderlust

    the wanderlust and the itching foot
    surely they are the same

    called by some a spirit bright

    by others a veriest bane

    give me the one with adventure fraught

    else undiscovered realms are dead

    with mankind dreaming an oafish dream

    and head fain filled with dread

    give me of the unpromised land

    where sweetness always abounds
    with courage oerflowing the measure

    and fortitude passing the rounds

     id rather see a world being born
     in blaze and flare of light

    than dull my senses with all its pleasures
    when bonds had riven it tight

    methinks weve given it spiteful name
    that is not used above

     the whisperings of this solace

    were better said wanderlove

beginning with the next issue
mr anthony rud will become
editor of adventure and by the old custom
which has never been broken except for a
few months last spring keeper of the
camp-fire although up to the present
time he has not been connected officially
with the magazine i know that he has
been sitting around the blaze with the
rest of us for more than a few years
many of you will remember his stories in
our pages i wont waste words telling
you that he is all right for i know that
the next few camp-fires and the next
few issues of the magazine will say that
much more effectively than i can id
like to tell you though what a pleasure it
has been to me to wield the pine knot
gavel even for so short a time and what
an honor im sure that the only fault
one could find with the job is that at
times it becomes almost too exciting for
its lively work to keep half a dozen dis-
cussions going under full sail and yet keep
them off the rocks of hard feeling but
comrade rud  know youll enjoy it

for free information and services you cant get elsewhere

the grand canon country

nothing for a laboring man to do
here but be overawed by the im-
mensity of things

   request-i am writing for a little information re-
garding the grand canon arizona the climate
hunting and fishing trapping also has a laboring
man a chance which is the best route for a boy to
go on a motorcycle-babney lewis paris
tenn

  reply by mr e e harriman-grand canon is
worn in a mesa or plateau that is  feet eleva-
tion above sea level and is itself  feet deep
 miles long and  miles wide in the broadest
part it is a national park and you can not hunt
or trap there but can go to the upper or lower
reaches of the canon and do both though it will not
pay you to try it

  in summer it is pretty hot there and in winter it
gets much snow

  i do not know what a laboring man would find
to do there since it is merely a natural wonder
which thousands visit each year

  the best route by which to reach grand canon ls
to follow the road across new mexico and arizona
through gallup-holbrook flagstaff-williams then
from williams north to the carton a motorcycle
will take you there easily remember arizona is
not thickly settled and has only two main industries
-stock raising and mining with cotton growing
coming in to help out and certain areas that are irri-
gated raising alfalfa and garden truck there is a
vast amount of land now idle there that would be
raising fine crops if they had a dam across the colo-
rado river high enough to make the water available
for use

  in the mines and ore mills a large number of men
find work at good wages no green hand can get a
job on a cattle ranch in arizona since he costs
more than he is worth according to the ranchers

bullet molding

making your own may seem like a
throw-back to pioneer days but it
does increase your range besides being
a very interesting process

  request-some time ago a year or two in fact i
saw an article of yours about making the -
rifle more efficient by using a hand-loaded cartridge
i mean home-loaded

  about that time i came into possession of a dandy
little gun of that caliber winchester -inch barrel
and i like it fine and can do good work with it up
to a little more than  yards but that seems to
be about the limit of accuracy which makes it but
little better than  special gun is or was new

  am using winchester and remington ammuni-
tion which costs at least  cents each here i think
this a little high but those two kinds seem to do best

  as i remember your statement you loaded some
yourself and greatly increased the range what
i would like to know is where to obtain the right
kind of stock and equipment for this purpose have
saved all my shells since reading your article have
nearly  i shoot mostly coyotes and find -
better because of added range-d a coyne
murdo s d

  reply by mr donegan wiggins-in reference to
the reloading of the - or  wcf cartridge
i find the best results to be secured from a hand-
loaded cartridge using a bullet tempered one part
tin to ten of lead and dupont no  rifle smokeless
powder loaded with any of the tools available today
these being yankee ideal modern-bond and beld-
ing  mull

  the case after firing should be resized in the tool
made for that purpose and i prefer the ideal for
this work belding  mull also sell a tool for this
purpose i never clean a shell using smokeless
powder as i find it unnecessary authorities to the
contrary notwithstanding

 


adventure

  in molding bullets to secure til cheaply i merely
get the tinfoil from cigar stores where it can gen-
erally be had from six cents per pound upward and
hardware stores charge about fifty cents per pound
for it in block lead can be had nearly anywhere
a good source is the battery shops where lead term-
inals can be had cheaply after being discarded you
should have the proper ideal or b  m dipper to
pour the lead into the molds as otherwise you may not
get a full solid bullet this causing erratic shooting

  id advise sending fifty cents each to the following
firms for their handbooks on reloading rifle and
revolver cartridges

  the lyman gunsight corp ideal div middle-
    town ct

  messrs belding  mull  osceola road
   phillipsburg pa

  i use the ideal tools as ive had them a long time
belding  mulls tools seem fine also in any case
get a double-adjustable chamber for reloading
as this will enable you to crimp each cartridge
mouth into the lead of the bullet thus making a
better job and preventing the bullets either slipping
forward out of the shell or back into it

  both books show a number of different bullets
adapted to the - and powder charges suitable
for different purposes i use the - in the
winchester rifle and colt risley model revolver
and find it a good clean-shooting load and very ac-
curate indeed

mate

a south american stimulant
used to balance ones diet and
drunk from a nest-egg gourd

  request-recently i have received a letter de-
scribing a south american product called joyz
yerba mate and since i was never anywhere near
there and no available information on hand ill
have to come to you for some information provided
its not too much trouble for you the questions are

  	what is the meaning of the name

  	what benefit does one derive by using same

  	is it used extensively in the south americas
republics

  	they claim it is a very good substitute for
alcoholic beverages is this true

  	why is it

  	where does it grow

  	is it scarce to find or does it grow abundant

  	the gourd from which they sip the concoction
what is that made of

  	what export company handles this stuff i
mean gourd mate and bombilla

  	if it is out of the states is it necessary to
write to them in the spanish language

  	if you can not answer question  will you let
me have the name of some of the exporters so that
i can write to them-edward f cihak berwyn


  reply by mr edgar young- yerba mate in
spanish or herba matte in portuguese is the name
for what the guarani indians called kaa or eaa mean-
ing the plant it is the tree tea growing in southern
brazil and in paraguay a tree closely allied to the
holly of this country which has quite a few of the
same properties as you will note if you every dry
holly leaves and steep them the trees grow a bit
larger than holly trees and the leaves are larger and
have no prickers on them i do not know what the
adjective you have ahead of the name means it is
possibly a trade name yerba or herba is the name
it is called by down there with the mate or matte
usually left off

  	it is a mild stimulant a diuretic a slight
laxative and is used locally to balance the ration
of the natives who eat much meat and little vege-
tables

  	in southern brazil uruguay paraguay and
chile it is extensively used considerable of it is
also used in europe this country imports very
little the last figure i saw was  barrels

  	no

  	it is not

  	see answer no 

  	abundant in the state of parana brazil and
paraguay

  	it is a small nest-egg gourd

  	they are only sold here as curios a few years
ago an outfit started a tea-house on seventh ave
here in new york and served the herb i havent
been up that way for a while and dont know how
they made out	

  	in spanish if in spanish speaking countries
brazil speaks portuguese

  	write bureau of foreign and domestic
commerce latin american division washington
d c and ask them for names of importers here in
the u s and also declared price per barrel they
have this information and will furnish it on request
also send  cts coin to pan american union
washington d c and ask them for their booklet
yerba mate which will give you a lot of information
about the tea

  heroes of aviation by colonel laurence
la tourette driggs published by little brown
and company of boston massachusetts 
this is a book that every reader of history should
have in his library for it contains the records of
practically all the leading pilots of both the
allied and german air forces intimate close
ups of the various aces are given by word and
photographs perhaps the most interesting of
all the chapters is the account of lieutenant frank
luke an interesting detail of this record of air
fighting shows up the fact that although the fast
single seater fighting squadrons and pilots received
most of the glory it was the observation pilots
and observers who suffered the greatest casualties
with the bombing pilots and bombardiers a very
close second however if we hadnt had the pur-
suit squadrons to clear the sky for us very few of
us would have been alive to tell the story-w g
schauffler

 the further venture book by elinor
mordaunt the century co this three hundred
page book is a classic of coral seas the distin-
guished authoress and adventurer has caught the
spirit of the tropical empire that is the dutch east
indies and the result is an absorbing and gripping
narrative in this little known part of the world
where human life is of little or no value where moral-
ity is on a high plane at least among the natives this
courageous englishwoman ventured alone success-
fully overcoming seemingly impossible difficulties
the result being the further venture book a worth-
while truthful and masterful description of this
topsy-turvy part of the globe which to use the
writers own words is smiling gay cruel and
variable to all those who love adventure in the
raw yet told in the most entertaining way i
heartily recommend this book it belongs in the
comparatively small library of books worth reading

the road through cheppy

by leonard h nason

if the red-haired ambulance driver had not insisted on their visiting every field-kitchen in their sector
to discover what cook was dishing out the best fare he and his pal wally certainly would not have
gone hungry that night nor would the colonel have sworn to high heaven that a german spy was
bombarding him with grenades and last but not least the red-nosed ghost would most assuredly

have for once turned in quite sober
