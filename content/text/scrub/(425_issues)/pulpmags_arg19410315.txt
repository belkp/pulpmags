murder goes to sea



   by allan r bosworth

               author of deep sea dugan moon over montezuma etc

  los angeles january -sit tight-were com-
  ing that terse message flashed to the bottom of
  the storm-tossed pacific early today by oscillator
  signals from the salvage tug algonquin spelled the dif-
  ference between life and death for thirty-three men

     they were the captain and surviving crew members of
   the new submarine starfish which sank mysteriously off
   the california coast yesterday afternoon

     twenty-two men are known to have lost their lives in
   the navys latest submarine disaster and meager reports
   from the ill-fated undersea craft indicated that several
   others were injured

      grim-lipped naval authorities battling time and weather
   to rescue the survivors refused to comment on the possi-
   bility that the new six-million-dollar warship may have
   been sabotaged

 they pointed out that nothing definite regarding the
sinking is likely to be known until the algonquins nine-

ton rescue bell has brought its first load to the surface

the starfish was commanded by lieut everett brill ii
and was the first of twenty similar ships to be constructed
by westco iron works

two civilian employes of westco-victor melhorne
chief engineer of the firm and foster bedell naval archi-
tect-are among those trapped in the ship they helped
design and build

lieutenant brill member of an old navy family has
seen his own career dogged by misfortune for several
years

while executive officer of the destroyer bolton three
years ago he was court-martialed and cleared of charges
of intoxication after the bolton had rammed another ship
in maneuvers

brills next post was command of a yangtze river gun-
boat which was beached and wrecked in a typhoon

brill is a mustang officer in navy parlance having

 a door closed twenty-two men
 were snuffed out of existence-
 and murder began to walk the
 decks of the uss consolation
 beginning an absorbing novel
 about that little-known unit of
 our fleet-the hospital ship

there in the darkness fathoms down adams
did what he had to do he knocked the
skipper out
murder goes to sea



come up from enlisted ranks after being dismissed from
the naval academy because of a boyish prank officers
who know him said

  he is a widower and his -year-old daughter evelyn
is a nurse in the navy hospital to which her father and
other survivors of the starfish probably will be taken   

chapter i

forty fathoms down

tt happened with an incredible stunning swiftness

  and nobody could say how after the first numbing
shock had worn off and there was no longer anything to
be done but wait and hope mike way began remember-
ing

  he lay on a bunk in the crowded torpedo room and be-
came conscious of ribs that pained him with every breath
he didnt want to think about those twenty-two men who
couldnt get out of the after compartments in time nor to
remember anything that had happened

  but there was no helping himself

  it was like a jumbled nightmare and the fragments of
its horror were spilled across a mans memory in jig-
saw puzzle fashion the mind subconsciously groped for
a piece at a time holding it up to examine its fantastic
shape and violent colors and trying to fit it into a pattern
of the whole

  but this nightmare was not entirely over and many
pieces were missing   

  mike way was a big man so rugged as to be almost
ugly with twelve years in the navy he was a chief tor-
pedoman and a master diver

  there was no responsibility for him now-all of it had
fallen on the shoulders of the skipper yonder-and he
could lie and taste the growing staleness of the air he
could watch the beams of the hand lanterns and flash-
lights that were used after the emergency circuit was cut
off

  he could study one taut pale face after another and
feel the slow agonizing crawl of the hours

  he tried to pull his thoughts back to the present and
to project them into the future it had not occurred to
him that a man under these conditions was entitled to
know a sweating fear

  the haunted look in the eyes of that kid standing near
the skipper-john thorpe his name was-came to mike
way as a shock the boy wasnt a day over seventeen

  mike looked around him lieutenant james the execu-
tive officer a small and imperturbable man sat on the deck
forward lieutenant mcquaid-he was a junior grade
and the engineer officer-lay in the opposite bunk sel-
dom stirring breathing loudly

  he had managed to get out of the flooding after com-
partments with only two other men and after coming
through the galley door he had desperately pulled it shut
and dogged it down

  that mike way thought took courage of a kind it
was a move necessary to save the ship and the men for-
ward it meant death for some of those who still were bat-
tling the slanting deck and the inrushing water aft

  mcquaid had dogged down the door and heard two or
three who reached it too late beating against the door
with their fists   

mike ways mind picked up one of those jigsaw pieces

it fitted in immediately after this scene it was cardoni
the dark-faced machinists mate second class who sat
yonder with grief and a sullen hate in his bloodshot eyes

  cardoni grabbing at mcquaid as he fought the door
cardoni screaming that his brother was back there and
taking a swing at mcquaid while the slant of the deck
turned so steep a man could scarcely keep his footing

  the two of them had fallen together and other men
came sprawling and sliding on top of them mcquaids
skull was very likely fractured cardoni had broken his
arm

  john thorpe the kid asked in a scared voice do-
do you think it will be long sir

  not long son said lieutenant brill stevens try
tapping again

  aye aye sir said the radioman the electricity had
been cut off to prevent an explosion caused by short-
circuiting to signal now stevens had to swing a heavy
sledge against the hull

  he tapped and mike way studied lieutenant brill he
felt more sympathy for the skipper than for anybody else
in this pigboat that lay forty fathoms down

  and that went for the twenty-two men aft they had
died quickly and lieutenant brill had died a thousand
times since

 te was a stocky graying man of forty-three who sat
handy to the precious oxygen flasks his cheeks were
flushed his eyes too bright he coughed steadily

  it would have been a hollow cough anywhere else but
there was pressure in the boat and the pressure made all
sounds flat

  mike way had done duty in the bolton with brill and
once after a shifting sea had given him the bends in a
dive he had been a patient at the hospital where evelyn
brill was stationed he liked them both

  there was a chance mike way thought that this pig-
boat disaster would wash up the skippers naval career
and put him on the beach for life he knew what the
navy meant to brill   

  thorpe said what time is it how long have we
been here

  steady son brill drew his hand across his eyes its
half past three

  eleven hours mike way thought they ought to be
hearing the algonquins oscillator soon the electricity
didnt have to be on to hear it if she was near enough

  the eastern sky would be paling up there

  eleven hours since the skipper keeping on schedule
to the minute had given the order for a full crash dive

  mike remembered something else just before the dive
mcquaid coming into the control room and asking the
skipper if brill was sure he was all right sniffing the air
as he asked mike remembered how the skipper had stif-
fened and told mcquaid to get to his station

  looking at brills flushed face now he wondered a little

  another man relieved stevens at the hull tapping they
stopped a while to listen and everybody heard the squeal
of the tugs oscillator all at once foster bedell ex-
claimed listen

  shes sighted our marker buoy stevens said

  men smiled brill opened the valve of an oxygen flask
new life poured into the thrice-breathed air

  we ought to hear a diver on deck by daylight brill
said

argosy

 

tvtike way turned to ease the hurt in his ribs and
---- studied the two civilians bedell and victor mel-
horne

  you expected courage on the part of navy men dis-
cipline had been hammered into them it was gratifying
to see civilians keep their nerve too

  melhbrne was stocky with pale eyes and a tight mouth

  bedell would have been a few years younger perhaps
he was obviously of  more nervous type slender and
dark he hadntshaved for more than twenty-four hours
and strain lined his face under its stubble

  but he kept himself well in hand if he was afraid no-
body would have guessed it

  lieutenant mcquaid turned as if in the restlessness of
a delirium lifting his bandaged head he sank back
sighing and miimbled through colorless lips

  it was a meaningless babble at first and then a few
words became coherent

       brill    something i know i could smell it
tell 

  the voice trailed into a babble and died wop car-
doni was straining forward his eyes burning into mc-
quaids face

  j hope he dies cardoni exclaimed i hope the so-
and-so never wakes

  cardoni snapped mike way pipe down

  he killed my brother cardoni said and stared at the
water-tight door beyond which the tragedy lay he killed
him just as sure as-	

  break it up there brill called wearily all the
strength seemed to have gone out of the skippers stocky
frame he coughed again and his shoulders sagged his
eyes were still too bright but there was a desperation in
them too

  i could smell it muttered lieutenant mcquaid

  victor melhorne met mike ways eyes he must be
getting better melhorne said think so chief

  mike way nodded he had put that bandage on the
gash in mcquaids head while melhorne did his best to
set and splint cardonis arm there were several others
suffering from cuts and bruises incurred when the starfish
slanted so steeply by the stern

  and the pharmacists mate was one of the twenty-two
back yonder   

  what time is it now young thorpe wanted to
know

  his face was drawn and desperate and his voice quivered
a little

  four oclock thorpe ought to be home in high school
mike way told himself a kid like that had no business
in the pigboats it wasnt right for a kid like that to
know the horror thorpe had gone through

  he was one of the three who had managed to get out
of that engine room mcquaid cardoni and thorpe run-
ning up a slanting deck with the black rushing water
closing over their frantic feet before they could make it-
the water spilling over the storm step threatening to fill
the entire ship

mike way closed his eyes against the nightmare but
his mind would not stop picking up the fragments
of its horror the pieces didnt fit there was nothing here
to show what had happened to send the starfish down so
suddenly

  she had dived before keeping her trim and performing

well she had held close to the schedule lieutenant brill
had laid out for her more than a week before the acceptance
trials began

  mike remembered the morning orders on the bulletin
board  full crash dive  surface and proceed
to port

  it was  now by the navys twenty-four hour clock
dawn would be stealing over the sea

  in navy ships along the coast the watch would be
changing and the ships cooks were starting breakfast in
a little while reveille would sound and the deckforce
would turn out to coffee and its job of washing down

  the algonquin was only a few miles away and hope
rode with her over the black rolling swells

  there was nothing to do but wait rescue was para-
mount now and mike way knew the skipper was wise
in speaking only of rescue and not of the mystery of what
had happened

  they had reserve oxygen and water and food and the
skipper had seen to it that soda lime was spread in the
torpedo room to absorb carbon dioxide

  time enough after they were out and up to consider
the sinking

  the hand lights were fewer and weaker mike ways
ribs stabbed him as he breathed the cold thick air he
pulled a blanket closer around him and grew drowsy

  a shout woke him and he sat up in quick alarm but
the shout had been one of joy overhead he heard the
slow clump-clump of a divers weighted shoes

chapter ii

eight were lucky

rphere was an eternity after this it passed for the
most part in darkness the skipper between fits of
coughing ordered that thd lights be carefully hoarded

  men huddled where they were cramped and cold be-
cause to move around or otherwise exert themselves meant
to use more of the precious air supply

  mike way needed no light to see things just as they had
been brill sitting yonder haggard and weary and feel-
ing twenty odd years of navy service caving out from
under him

  cardonis brooding eyes turned on the unconscious mc-
quaid

  john thorpes frightened look and the two civilians
bearing up well under the strain

  foster bedell became talkative now it was a release
from the anxiety that lined his stubbled face mike
guessed

  how many men can the bell take up at a time he
wanted to know

  eight brill said and coughed you two men will
make the first trip

  melhorne said thats not necessary captain and
there was a quiet courage in his voice i think bedell
and i could wait	

  sure bedell declared im perfectly willing to stay
until the last as a matter of fact i wish there were some
way we could get at the straight of this thing-how it
happened i mean the more i think of it the more in-
credible it seems

  mike way understood it took time for the full force
of it to hit a man melhorne and bedell knew every rivet
murder goes to sea



every bolt in the ship they had had confidence in her
in a large measure everybody aboard had felt that con-
fidence it went with a new ship proud and sleek and
powerful

  staying down wont solve whats behind that door aft
brill sighed another fit of coughing shook him thats
going to wait until shes raised im afraid if they can
raise her at all

  dont you think salvage can be accomplished cap-
tain bedell asked it surely wouldnt be more difficult
than the raising of the s- and the s-

  oh it can be done said the skipper im only afraid
it will be delayed a long while its a long and tedious
process at this depth and in these shifting currents and
the navy may be needed elsewhere in times like these

the diver moved around on the starfishs hull groping
for the escape hatch brill swung his flashlight beam
to the overhead and stevens hammered the hatch cover
with a wrench

  they could hear the man outside working at the difficult
task of securing the downhaul cable on which the huge
bell would be operated

  mike way began to feel fidgety for the first time he
knew every move that was necessary on the divers part
-he had felt the pressure that man was fighting at forty
fathoms under a rolling sea

  and he wished he could be in a diving suit now help-
ing

  i wonder if lieutenant mcquaid will be able to tell us
anything melhorne asked as if speaking to himself

  thats rather hard to say brill said coldly

  something had passed between those two mike way
decided something more than the incident in the control
room just before the full crash dive whatever it was he
told himself it was no business of an enlisted man

  but he wondered if mcquaid would live to tell anything
at all his head had struck an angle iron by the water-
tight door and nobody needed to be a surgeon to see that
the injury was bad

  besides it was unlikely that mcquaid had had an op-
portunity to observe any more than thorpe and cardoni
had seen

  these two had not been questioned but in his earlier
hysteria thorpe had cried the water it came in-it
came in from everywhere all at once

  that it seemed was it the water had suddenly rushed

in

the oscillator squealed and men stirred restlessly and
took a new animated interest in conversation the
algonquin said the downhaul cable had been secured and
the bell would soon be on its way down

  there was a destroyer-the meade-standing by and
others were coming to the scene the meade was wait-
ing to rush the injured to port for hospitalization

  boy muttered a sailor in the dark after this intel-
ligence had been imparted why didnt i bust a leg or
something

  they can leave me off at the dock another said i
dont need any castor oil or iodine i need about six
straight shots of liquor am i going to make a speed run
when i hit the beach

  it was rough up there the algonquin added and a new
tenseness stifled the conversation almost as soon as it had

begun the men sat silent and motionless in the dark

what if they cant make it thorpes voice quavered
i want out of here i cant stand it its like a-like a

coffin

   take it easy kid somebody said gruffly

   nobody blamed him the truth was mike way thought
that everybody was really scared to death an older man
just knew how to tie down his fear and keep it in check

   brill coughed and said the injured will go first that
means lieutenant mcquaid cardoni way-and whos
that with a cut on his cheek kowalski and thorpe and
melhorne and mr bedell thats seven then in alpha-
betical order you adams-
adams a salty first-class torpedoman was holding a
three-inch brass cartridge case it was weighted with bab-
bit and wired for a table lamp with anchors and other
decorations hammered into it

   he growled hell captain sir i can wait and hugged
the lamp to him

   you ought to go captain james said the executive
officer was calm and assured let me take over sir
that cough-

   its my privilege to stay until the last brill said he
spoke simply in a voice too tired to carry any note of
heroics

   mike way raised on an elbow captain he pleaded
you may not be hurt but youre sick do what lieuten-
ant james says sir 

thatll do chief the skipper called back recogniz-
ing ways voice you heard what i said its an order
adams chuckled dryly id hate to get a general court
for mutiny on the bottom of the high seas but captain
you ought to go

tt was a long while before the nine-ton rescue cham-
ber came to a jarring rest on the hull of the starfish
and it seemed even longer after that before the ballast
tanks had been filled and the water was blown out of the
bells lower compartment

   the men in the torpedo room grew restive hearing the
rescue bell crew working to secure the tie rods and open
the hatch

   then quite suddenly those below heard the hatch break
its seal there was a crack of light it widened into a
glow and the air which flowed into the submarine was
fresh and sweet by comparison the hatch was open

  men moved forward not in any stampede toward es-
cape but impelled by the desire to look into the light-
to see beyond the curving steel that imprisoned them and
to breathe the compressed air that came from the surface

   hi men  yelled the dungareed sailor who peered down
at them whos going forthe first ride

  lieutenant james exclaimed what happened to the
captain bear a hand here you men

   mike way looked lieutenant brill was slumped against
the oxygen tank and his chin was skinned

   what the hell are you looking at me for chief de-
manded adams guiltily i guess the captain must have
fallen over something in the dark

   james grunted i guess he did adams he said dryly
especially since hes sitting right where he was well he
goes up hes a casualty now bring mcquaid forward
mike way swung his feet into the dirty water that cov-
ered the after portion of the deck help me here car-
doni he said and you kowalski


argosy

  i got a busted arm cardoni reminded him sullenly
and i wouldnt help lift him out of hell

  stow that sort of talk lieutenant james warned
sharply give the chief a hand there stevens

  they carried mcquaid forward and hoisted him up the
ladder mike way couldnt lift much because of his in-
jured ribs he turned his attention to the skipper

  when he put his good arm around everett brills inert
body he felt something hard a bottle it was in the
pocket of the skippers dungaree jumper and now that
fresh air had diluted the mixture of smells in this compart-
ment where men sweated despite the cold he could dis-
tinguish the odor of alcohol

  mike way slipped the bottle from brills pocket with-
out anyones seeing and dropped it behind the rack of
torpedoes at his side he was remembering that time in
the bolton when brill faced a court martial accused of
being drunk aboard ship

  they carried the skipper up the ladder he was one
of the first and not the last to leave the ship he had com-
manded and lost

  mike way was the eighth man he was on the ladder
when the chief yeoman handed him the log of the starfish
-a new book and already closed

  better take this with the skipper the yeoman said

  mike way found a seat on the circular bench under the
dome of the rescue bell one of its two-man crew was
down in the lower compartment he closed the hatch cover
on men who looked longingly on the light and still managed
to smile

  shake it up you guys somebody yelled from below
make your regular trip and return coxn

then compressed air rumbled the water out of the bal-
last tanks and into the lower compartment the rescue
bell broke its seal on the starfishs hull it lurched and
started upward the compressed air motor was put in
reverse to act as a brake against the bells buoyancy

  lieutenant mcquaid held propped on the seat between
foster bedell and victor melhorne muttered  smell
it plain  i know that smell my head  oh dont-
dont

  they werenearly to the heaving surface when it hap-
pened

  none of the rescued men knew exactly what had oc-
curred but there was a sickening sidewise lurch as the
swells took hold and a thumping rattling noise began
under the wheel-locked hatch that covered the water-filled
lower compartment where the downhaul cable was unwind-
ing from its winch

  the sailor operating the compressed air engine yelled
sharply watch your heads and everybody lifted off the
seat a few inches and fell back feeling the bell rocking
slightly

  it was like riding an express elevator until it strikes
the safety cushion at the top of the shaft

  mike way realized they had stopped they were on
the surface

  jeez the engineer exclaimed lucky-you eight
guys are sure lucky that downhaul cables carried away
its a good thing we didnt come up under the ship

  mike way said somebody will have to make that dive
again and wished his ribs had not been hurt the sailor
nodded

  the bell swayed as the hoisting cable attached to the

algonquins boom took up the slack and there was the
welcome sound of feet on the topside of the rescue cham-
ber

  the upper hatch opened

  nobody in the bell had ever seen a sky half so blue or 
tasted air so heavenly sweet as this when a man climbed
out the wide horizons looked limitless after those crowding
steel bulkheads

  there was room here room to move in room to live

 in

 chapter iii

 stand by for surgery

 dmiral wetherbee fidgeted in his bed in sick
officers quarters at the naval hospital this was like
being in drydock it was no place for a man who had spent
more than forty years at sea	-

 he was getting damned tired of being cooped up

  the admiral was an old man and gaunt but there were
evidences that his age was mostly external-except for a
brittleness of bones-just as a ship shows the years by a
wearing of decks and companionways and a mellowness
of her woodwork

  the admirals eyes were as blue as the sea that had
been his life and they could be as dark as storm clouds
or as bright as sun-sparkled swells

 he still had a voice meant to be lifted against a gale

  his eyes were dark now as he morosely regarded his
starboard leg it was bulkily encased in plaster and
hoisted by a complicated arrangement of tackle and pulleys
at an angle the admiral estimated was just short of forty-
five degrees	i

  no seaman the admiral swore could have devised such
gear irish pennants stuck out like sore thumbs in places
where the line had been knotted not spliced damn their
lubberly ways but knotted

  the admiral would have liked to give this modern soda-
fountain navy a few lessons in marlinspike seamanship

  he wanted something to read particularly he wanted
the afternoon papers which should contain something new
about the rescue of the men in the starfish

  but he disliked appearing to be testy the nurse or a
hospital corpsman would bring him the papers he thought
as soon as they had arrived

  he picked up mahans influence of sea power upon
history and sighed because he knew it by heart and be-
cause hed probably never go to sea again

  he dropped mahan on the deck by his bed and fol-
lowed it with the latest issue of u s naval institute pro-
ceedings

  there was a third book on his bedside table he opened
it and scanned its pages

  it was a navy deck log and fairly new with only a
score of its pages filled the writing was a neat and pre-
cise script which neither hesitated nor grew bold

  it was typical of the man nobody needed be a chirog-
rapher to see that admiral wetherbees penmanship de-
noted an alert and orderly mind with a passion for detail
and method where they were required

  the writing was small like the ship models he made
at home  of all the ships the admiral had sailed in only
his last-the flagship of the submarine force-was not yet
represented on his mantel
murder goes to sea



 and the flagship itself had been half done when the
 admiral slipped at the top of his cellar workshop steps

 that mishap was duly recorded here in the log but
 admiral wetherbee would not have been guilty of re-
 ferring to the cellar steps as such the manner in which
 he adhered to nautical nomenclature may be gauged by a
 perusal of the full entry for that day

    anchored as before  mustered crew on sta-
 tions no absentees made daily inspection of gal-
 ley lanigan bridget ships cook warned to keep
 supply of turkey legs in icebox

      made all preparations for getting under way
 via automobile for provisions  got under way
 standard speed  knots on course  true

    at  changed course to avoid heavy truck
 crossing bow  moored port side of main street

      got under way for return to base  

     admiral j k wetherbee usn retd

 commanding suffered a fracture of the right
 leg when he fell down the after hatch   

     pursuant to the recommendation of comdr

 l m phelps mc usn admiral wetherbee
 was transferred to the naval hospital	

 the admirals shaggy brows pulled together in a fierce
 quarterdeck frown as he noted the date on that en-
 try more than twenty days bones knit slowly at
 seventy

 and twenty days in drydock was a long time-especially
 to a man who never slept more than three or four hours
 at night

 it was time for those afternoon papers the admiral
 reached for his buzzer

 the nurse who answered was tall and no costume would
 have been severe enough to conceal entirely the fact that
 she was pretty he glared at her with mock severity

 yes admiral she said in a soft well-controlled voice
 there was no hint of strain in it or in her face but the
 admiral knew she hadnt slept the night before

 his glare was tempered by a light of pride evelyn
 brill was navy clear through

 what the devil are you doing on duty he demanded
 didnt i tell you to get some rest what good does your
 being on watch do

 i feel better carrying on this is my last day in

 soq though im issigned to surgery starting tomor-
 row unsterile nurse at first

 humph grunted the admiral and regarded her for
 a space then ill have to quarrel with somebody else
 unless i go to sea-oh you neednt look at me like thatl
 i may fool you and dont twist those newspapers to
 pieces evelyn any news

 hes safe said the daughter of lieutenant brill
 they brought him up on the bells first trip

 admiral wetherbees shaggy brows lifted slightly but
 he tried to cover his thoughts he said well thank
 god for that and smoothed out the papers

 a big headline shouted

   first eight rescued from sub

salvage cable breaks

 that means the girl said calmly enough that hes
 hurt

  not necessarily the admiral put in hastily there
could be other reasons

  to make him leave his ship no but im not afraid
of the injuries i have a feeling he may be blamed-offi-
cially-for the loss of the starfish

  admiral wetherbee rustled the newspaper and hid be-
hind it nonsense he growled nothing to blame on
him i know submarines they can be treacherous craft
in more ways than one

  but he understood what the loss of his command could
do to everett brill ii he had known captain everett
brill i and he had dandled this girl on his knee when
she was a baby

  he could remember when he was commandant of the
academy and young everett brill ii was bilged out of the
school

  twenty years now the admiral had been interested in
brills naval career telling himself that if a man were
really navy hed wind up with plenty gold on his sleeves
whether he wore an academy ring or not   

  the meade is standing in evelyn said theyll be
here pretty soon

rphe door opened it was dr vincent ayres-he was a
medical corps lieutenant-who respectfully awaited
the admirals acknowledgment of his presence

  he was young and blond with a long face that was
both serious and sensitive and made him look older

  he wore gold-rimmed glasses that somehow managed
always to stay crystal clear and his eyes were cool blue
crystal beyond them

  eyes and glasses summed up the mans clear-headed
alert dependability

  he smiled at evelyn just three nights before theyd
gone dancing off duty it was evelyn and vince
and more than once in the past few weeks she had had
to remind herself that a navy nurse had no business fall-
ing in love

  you couldnt get married and stay in the navy nurse
corps

  well doctor admiral wetherbee grumbled i sup-
pose youve come to tell me my request has been disap-
proved i have a friend or two in the bureau and damn
them-

  no sir vince ayres said i dont believe its been
heard from i came here after miss brill i happen to
have the duty tonight and theres to be an emergency
surgical case

  evelyn looked up with quick intuition from the
starfish

  he nodded we dont know who it is cranial in-
juries miss weltons ashore could you-

  ill stand by of course

  good girl itll be a few minutes yet i wouldnt
worry

  he left to get ready for the operation it was fortu-
nate evelyn thought that vince ayres had the watch
he was accounted the best surgeon on the station in cra-
nial cases

  the admiral knew this good thing hes here he
grunted keep your chin up young lady

  neither the admiral nor evelyn brill could know any
inkling of what was to happen that night when the girl
had gone the old sea dog reached for his fountain pen
and made an entry in his log


argosy

 long habit ruled him wherever he might be the log
 was written as if he were in command

 word passed for surgery crew to lay to their

station brill evelyn nnc standing by despite

anxiety	s

chapter iv

in this life is death

 the ambulances had not arrived there was a minute
 - before the emergency before the surgery lights ham-
 mered a cruel glitter from scalpels and haemostats and
 retractors

 evelyn brill leaned on the balcony railing trying not
 to think

 she looked down over the drop of the rolling hills with
 their tall eucalyptus trees down over the sun-gleamed
 stucco of the quiet town and out to the blue pacific

 a wind was blowing and she knew the sea ran high
 but from this distance it looked soft and kind with islands
 far out yonder like storm clouds melting into the waters
 rim

 the silver sliver of a destroyer moved along the bay
 the sun was low but its red glint caught navy wings high
 aloft and a drone came to evelyns ears as if riding that
 flash of light

she could hear a radio playing softly in one of the wards

 she prayed silently dear god dont let it be dad who
 is hurt dont let them blame him this time   

 and she remembered with a sudden shame that there
 were still men on the seas bottom out yonder

 she saw a heavy important-looking man in civilian
 clothes pacing the sidewalk before the administration
 building which was centered on the west side of the gar-
 dened quadrangle there was nervousness in each of his
 jerky indecisive strides

 then the first ambulance growled into the driveway at
 the quadrangles far end and glided swiftly around toward
 the surgery building with a short warning roll of its
 siren

 the other was close behind men wearing dungarees
 climbed out one had his arm in a sling another was
 limping she saw a slender dark-faced man in a gray
 suit-one of the two civilians who had been in the starfish
 and then white-clad hospital corpsmen came on the run
 to lift out a stretcher

 panic seized the girl briefly she couldnt bear to look
 on this it might be her father she turned her back on
 the green-lawned beauty of the quadrangle on sunshine
 and fresh air

 she went slowly into the hall of the surgery

 if evelyn brill had not been born a girl navy records
 would have contained the name of ensign everett brill
 iii by now or failing-annapolis as her father and many
 another good man had failed it seaman everett brill
 working up from the ranks

 she knew little of that civilian world the navy pityingly
 calls the outside

 her earliest remembering had been of gray ships stand-
 ing in and standing out of a jumbled never-ending suc-
 cession of greetings and goodbyes on navy landings where
 mist swirled and foghorns blatted and sailors wearing leg-
 gins and duty belts shouted a ships name every time a
 boat bell clanged

  transfers the tropics to boston san pedro to norfolk
seattle to pearl harbor catch a transport sell the fur-
niture drive to philadelphia-and dont forget to change
the oil in kansas city

  that was the navy and the blue and gold so far as
a woman was concerned that was why perhaps evelyn
brill was wary of falling in love with a navy man

  a navy doctor stood by when she was born everett
brill i-a commander then-paced the deck of the hos-
pital waiting room his son paced the deck of a war-
ship half a world away

  and the commander assured myra brill that her hus-
bands presence was entirely unnecessary

  hell myra he told her bluffly just because a mans
needed when a keel is laid is no sign he has to be on
hand at the launching ill send him a radio the minute
the boys born

there is only one way in which a girl who has be-
 trayed several generations-by being bom a girl-can
join the navy that is to become a navy nurse

  which is why evelyn brill was here one of three hun-
dred and twenty picked women scattered from portsmouth
to the philippines

  some of them were young and pretty like evelyn but
the navy didnt tell them so the navy told them things
like the waist at the neck must open not lower than
two and a half inches from the interclavicular notch   
sachet powder perfume any unguent having noticeable
odor  are prohibited   

  evelyn brill was loveliness wrapped in plain white
drill

  there was seldom anyone to exclaim over the discovery
that her cool impersonally efficient gray eyes could be
strangely soft and warm there were few opportunities for
anybody to marvel at the shimmer of candlelight im-
prisoned by the changing copper tints of her hair

  but over in soq the old man whose sea-blue eyes
seldom missed anything was indulging in one of his rare
lapses when he permitted purely personal speculations to
enter into his log he frowned at the door for a while
and then wrote

    brill evelyn deserves citation at meritorious
  mast romance  while word for surgery detail
  was being passed sighted flashing light in eyes of
  lieut vincent ayres mc usn whats hold-
  ing him back	

  it might be stated that there were some who considered
that the admiral who kept a log had missed too many
transports on the china station which was the navy way
of intimating that his mind was not sound

  but vince ayres who was somewhat of a brain special-
ist and knew psychiatry would have disputed this

tnce ayres shucked his uniform and appeared in
 the hallway of the surgery in white cotton pajamas
he saw evelyn opening the linen locker to get her cap
and gown and started her way taking a last few drags on
a cigarette

  a stout white-haired man puffed in from the stairway
perspiring and twisting a felt hat in his soft well-kept
hands he halted blinking in the dimness

  is this-will they be brought here him i mean
evelyn glanced at vince ayres one i believe she
said the-the one with the skull injury
murder goes to sea



  thats the one the man said mcquaid the en-
gineer officer ive got to talk to him-ive got to find out
what happened im martin west  built that sub-
marine	i
the elevator was whining up vince ayres saw the
girl close her eyes for a thankful space and he moved
quickly to her side but she wasnt the fainting kind

  he turned to martin west but before he could ad-
dress the shipbuilder a girl in a fur coat appeared from
the balcony door

  she was dark and attractive vince got the immediate
impression that no expense had been spared in smart
shops and beauty parlors to make her so

  father she exclaimed you cant stay here theyve
asked us to wait in the reception room at sick officers
quarters the men are being brought there

  west said hoarsely ive got to find out before pacific
maritime gets that contract away from me but he went
with the girl and the elevator reached the floor opening
with a clatter

  vince ayres and evelyn stood against the wall to let
the stretcher pass into the anesthetizing room vince
looked thoughtfully after the girl

  barbara west he said ive seen her photo in the
society sections going to be married isnt she

  i dont know evelyn said and the doctor turned to
face her

  evelyn i should have called on somebody else i
thought youd be under less strain working theyll
probably put those men to bed at once and allow nobody
to see them unless they got some rest on the destroyer
and-well i wanted to work with you

  im all right evelyn said and managed a smile youd
better run along and get scrubbed up

  dr brown an older man and a lieutenant commander
hurried in to be vinces assistant a clatter of basins came
from the surgery where miss snyder had taken over as
sterile nurse and mike way came up the stairs

mighty fast by the stern some loose gear carried away
and men were sliding all over the control room

  i brought up against something and there was a whole
pile of us at the galley door-the door leading aft to the
engine room

  water started coming through there and three men
got out mcquaid was one of them hes the one who
had the-nerve-to shut that door and dog it down

  his grin was gone and remembered horror twisted his
mouth evelyn laid her hand on his arm

  dont talk about it now she begged you go and
turn in tell dad ill see him after he catches up on some
rest

  the hospital corpsmen wheeled mcquaid past it didnt
take much ether to anesthetize a man who was already
unconscious evelyn brill went in the wake of the wheeled
stretcher remembering what mike way had said

  only mcquaid might know what had happened to
send the starfish so quickly to her doom

che opened a swinging door and the breath of the oper-
 ating room struck her sharply like a blow across the
face with an ether-saturated sponge

  moisture clung to the tiled walls as if they sweated in
agony the walls imprisoned a remoteness from all things
natural sunshine and laughter the winds whisper and
the perfume of flowers the feel of turf underfoot and the
music in the seas rolling

  the operating room was a little world in itself where
science took over when nature failed it was a world of
travail and hope of mercy and tragedy of drugged slum-
ber and pain

  steam feathered from the bright chrome sterilizers and
mushroomed against the drab leaded skylight incan-
descents beat down with inflexible brilliance there were
no shadows anywhere and no coolness

  over all the smells lay heavily a miasma of carbolic
acid ether and iodine steam-burned muslin steam-baked
rubber alcohols sharpness and tincture of green soap

  hospital corpsmen were lifting mcquaid to the table
he was under the anesthetic his blue lips fluttering with
each labored exhalation the anesthetist lifted his ether
cone and pinched the lobe of mcquaids ear watching
how quickly the color returned

  that pigboat must have hit something hard he said
hard enough to throw a man down and fracture his
skull

  another corpsman grunted it didnt happen that way
i talked to a couple of them guys

  you see that one with a busted arm they said he
took a poke at this officer the lieutenant dogged down
that door and this sailors brother was behind it

  id hate to be that pigboat sailor you take a poke at
any officer in this mans navy youre asking for a general
court if he wants to make something of it

ttvelyn moved a basin nearer the table and busied
herself with the sheet that covered mcquaid her
cheeks were burning there was a hint of trouble here
trouble for everett brill

  and the garrulous corpsmans next words were worse
he went on whats more one of them guys told me
that this lieutenant called the skipper down about drink-
ing therell sure be a stink raised if this officer pulls
through all-

he was in dungarees his chief petty officers cap set
rakishly over a smudged forehead evelyn exclaimed
chief way im glad to see you again 

  the big diver grinned im glad to be here miss brill
your-the skipper sent me up to report he-

  evelyn drew a quick breath is he badly hurt where
is he

  theyre turning us all in at soq for tonight and
hes not hurt hes got a bad cough and looks to me like
maybe he had some fever though of course the skipper
is kind of dazed and shocked you know

  he gestured and evelyn knew but there was some-
thing else she had to find out as quickly as possible

  was it anybodys fault chief will they try to blame
dad this time

  the big mans eyes flicked away for a fraction of a
second then mei hers honestly i dont think so miss
brill it wasnt his fault id swear to that somebody
may try to lay it onto him but if they do it wont stick

  you see nobody knows yet exactly what happened
unless its the lieutenant in there-mcquaid

  he jerked his chin toward the anesthetizing room and
she thought his eyes hardened she noticed he was hold-
ing one hand across his ribs after climbing the stairs
youre hurt she said

  just a bruise he grinned the ship went down


argosy

  hey pipe down the anesthetist growled with a
quick glance toward evelyn vince ayres and dr brown
came in just then and miss snyder her apple-cheeked
face half covered by the gauze mask lifted a tray of in-
struments to the sterile table

  vince ayres eyes smiled at evelyn first case in
surgery eh miss brill he asked and chuckled the
admiral will miss you do you know what he meant when
he spoke of that request

  evelyn shook her head no but hes an old darling
ill miss him ton

  we all may said vince ayres hes such a con-
firmed old sea dog hes requested-demanded would be
a better word-transfer to the consolation he says if
hes got to be laid up he might as well be laid up on a
hospital ship-at sea where a man belongs

  the doctor chuckled again and then bent to his task
in an instant he seemed transformed into a stranger to
evelyn brill a cool efficient stranger with marvelously
skillful hands

  and watching him remembering the look in mike ways
eyes and the thing the hospital corpsman had just said
she knew for an instant a guilty feeling

  it was almost a wish that lieutenant mcquaid would
never recover consciousness

                                                   

chapter v

midwatch murder

it was an hour before the doors swung open again mc-
quaid wrapped in white blankets was wheeled toward

soq

  vince ayres peeled off his gloves and threw them on the
sponge-littered deck he went into the hall with evelyn
breathing deeply of the purer air and they saw martin
west pacing the corridor

  the other two civilians were with him now west still
perspiring caught at vince ayres arm

  hell live vince said

  thank god west cried you hear that victor
thank god for one more saved oh doctor-this is mr
melhorne my chief engineer and mr bedell the de-
signer of our submarines

  you were both aboard the starfish werent you
vince ayres asked in surprise you certainly ought to be
in bed

  the stocky melhornes mouth tightened i couldnt
sleep he said and his pale eyes seemed to see things
beyond the white plaster wall not-not while those
boys are still down there

  they arent out yet evelyn asked

  no not yet melhorne answered and foster bedell
pushed his shoulders wearily away from the wall the
lines in his unshaven face seemed growing deeper

  the divers are still having trouble he said heavy
seas but theyll all be saved when could we talk to
mcquaid doctor

  i dont know that vince ayres replied but not
soon he may not regain consciousness the minute the
anesthetic wears off there was pressure on the brain it
may take time

  martin west turned jerkily lets wait in the reception
room then i want some more coffee

evelyn brill got her uniform cape from the locker it

was blue and lined with scarlet and she didnt know how
well it went with her coloring

  vince ayres studied her while he got a cigarette and
lighted it

  itd take more than coffee for me he said slowly
id hate to feel responsible for having built that ship
and id hate to be worrying about a contract before those
boys have been rescued    evelyn you must be fagged
youd better turn in doctors orders

  she smiled faintly the sun was down and a chill had
come in from the sea she threw the cape around her
shoulders and shook her head

  but i havent seen dad yet vince and if i might
id like to stand by lieutenant mcquaids quiet room
please vince-theres a reason id like to hear anything
he says conscious or not

  vinces clear eyes studied her for a moment then he
patted her arm

   i understand he said ill wait there with you you
run on over and ill be along just as soon as i shower
and dress and make the rounds of the wards

tiarkness had fallen but only a couple of table lamps
burned in the big lounge that opened on the corridor
of sick officers quarters

 evelyn brill entered the dimness and heard mike way
say here she is sir and there was a stir then of men
leaving to give her and lieutenant brill a moment alone

   she saw that rank had been forgotten temporarily and
that restrictions on visiting hours had been let down all
seven of the survivors who were able to walk had been
billeted here and martin west was going out the door
with his daughter

   evelyn could look around the room and sense the lone-
liness that had filled it the men had been sitting in a
tight little group around coffee tables that were littered
with cups and ash trays	x

  for the time being she knew all others-even navy
people-were outsiders and it came to her quickly that
there might be something significant in the fact that these
men all had been kept together

   the navy wanted no false rumors to get out concerning
sabotage-or anything else   

  her father rose from a leather-upholstered davenport
he wore pajamas and a dressing gown like the rest she
could see the strain in his face and his eyes were too
bright fever as mike way had said

   they stood for a space wordless brills eyes were those
of a man looking on something which is beautiful-some-
thing he had never expected to see again

  admiral wetherbees booming voice drifted down the
corridor to break the silence but damn it all thats
what hospital ships are for and the seas good for a
man-

a door closed smothering the voice lieutenant brill
caught his daughter fiercely in his arms but she could
feel in that close motnent that he was stunned and be-
wildered with all the strength gone out of him

   he held her at arms length and his palms were hot to
her shoulders she thought hes aged ten years

  sit down dad she wanted to cry but the navy
doesnt do that you ought to be in bed mike way
is right youre ill

   he coughed ive got a little bronchitis nothing to
murder goes to sea

is

worry about had it before we went out but the schedule
was all laid out and-evelyn i ought to be out there now

  damn them i belong with my ship if i ever find
the man who hit me in the dark ill have him court-
martialed

  sit down she said and pushed him to the davenport
nobody will blame you for coming up dad and if a
man hit you it was because he loved you the whole
crew loved you

  loved me brills voice mocked the words not all
of them evelyn not mcquaid in yonder if mcquaid
goes before the inquiry hell testify that i was drunk
he couldnt

  he stared into her tense face and his eyes were bleak as
if he did not see her 

  oh yes he could i read rocks and shoals to him last
week and hes been nursing a grudge once in a while
you find an academy man who resents a mustangs being
in command oh theyre very few but there are some

  mcquaid will make a good officer in time he just
got his jaygee rank and hes been a battleship sailor hes
been used to more military ways

  you know as well as i that those things dont go on a
pigboat where you live so close to your men you-
you hadnt been drinking evelyn said

  it wasnt a question but a simple statement of faith
brill recognized it as such

  no of course not i wouldnt be so big a fool

  the others were coming back driven by their lonely
unrest evelyn patted her fathers hand dont worry
she whispered mcquaid will probably have forgotten the
incident it seems everybodys depending on him to tell
them what happened

  maybe he can brill said those other two men
were in the galley and mcquaid was the only one out of
the engineroom itself otherwise we wont know until
the ships raised

  all i can say is it was quick and violent water
must have come in by tons

mike way approached the davenport standing re-
spectfully and looking down at his skipper still
too rough sir he said savagely i wish i was out there
i wish i could dive

 the little group sat down the silence was a brooding
prowling thing that taxed the nerves a pharmacists mate
came from the hall carrying an ice cap mcquaids ice
cap all eyes turned to him

  martin west puhed himself from the edge of his chair
is he conscious can he talk

  his voice was excited

  hes delirious the corpsman said now and then
he mumbles something about a smell the ether i guess
west sank back and the corpsman went into the diet
kitchen they heard-him pounding ice for the ice cap
the blows echoed hollowly in the silence and then car-
donis bitter voice said i hope he never comes to he
could have let my brother out of there he-

  pipe down snapped mike way everett brill drew
a deep breath and went into a fit of coughing

i wont get over the tragedy of those men west said
shakily but ive got the contract to worry about too
six ships on the ways right nowand thirteen to lay down
if the starfish had a structural weakness ive got to

know what it was the government might cancel that
contract and my competitor-

  oh the hell with your damned contract brill shout-
ed there are still men down in that ship

  im sorry captain west muttered i havent for-
gotten them

  evelyn looked down the long hall and saw vince ayres
come in from the balcony making his rounds he stopped
to consult miss wilkins-she was the soq night nurse
-in her little office at the far end and then he came to
the reception room

  this wont do men he said quietly youre all
patients except mr west turn in now i promise to
relay you any news as quickly as it comes mr west you
and miss west are at liberty to remain here under the
circumstances but id advise a hotel

  id rather stay west said everett brill rose heavily
all right men he said break it up he kissed eve-
lyns cheek and mike way grinned at her as he passed
pushing his square jaw upward in a gesture that meant
for her to keep her chin high

  it also meant she reflected that he understood her
fathers worries

  the men followed their skipper out their faces were
weary and they talked in murmurs

  vince drew evelyn aside ill have to back down on
that permission for you to sit out a watch or two over
mcquaid he said grimly youve got things to do
youre shoving off for sea at dawn

  for sea she echoed youre joking

  no im not the consolation has been ordered to the
scene with some extra nurses and doctors and corpsmen
its going to be a tough rescue job well probably have
a ward full of divers with the bends and when those
other men are brought up theyll need immediate hospital-
ization

  evelyn put hands to her temples to press out a thought
just when her father needed her most   

  im going too vince ayres smiled squeezing her
arm youd better pack a bag and get some sleep

tt was midnight before she had done with packing crisp
white uniforms into the bag at her room in nurses
quarters across the hall mae kennedy was doing the
same thing four nurses were going mae had said

  this was the navy here today and gone tomorrow
as her father had been gone when myra brill needed him
under any other circumstances evelyn would have wel-
comed sea duty

  the telephone startled her she thought anotheremer-
gency and then knew that vince ayres would have called
on somebody else in that event perhaps it was good
news instead perhaps vince had word that the rest of
the starfishs crew had been rescued and that the conso-
lations orders had been revoked

  she lifted the receiver it was vince all right but his
usually cool voice sounded tense

  evelyn dont be alarmed your father is quite all
right its mcquaid

  evelyn caught her breath hes dead she said with
a sudden prescience vince-hes dead

  come over to soq at once vince ayres said he
didnt just-just die evelyn he was murdered clubbed
to death in his bed

 his honor is missing

over a floodtide darker and more terrible than the river styx ferried by a babbling
broken-down charon two young people sought a fabulous diamond-and the key to
a seventy-year-old mystery what they found was the gateway to madness

 by theodore roscoe

chapter 

long live the corpse 

this is the mystery story of a mayor who committed
suicide and then after he was buried and the grave-
diggers went home the insurance companies said it
wasnt the mayor at all that some stooge had been buried
in the mayors place

  and the question then naturally was where was the
mayor whose funeral was it good citizens wondered
if his honor was so honorable after all

  how could the mayor of an american city disappear
why was it kidnaping-a traction scandal-politics-
an insurance gag-a case of cherchez la jemme

  politicians usually go to their own funerals did the
foul hand of murder clutch shadowy fingers around city
hall

  folks are still asking those questions about this famous
case and if you want to know the answers you must look
for them as edith johnwell did in binghamton new
york

  yes it happened in binghamton where the susque-
hanna flows with deceptive placidity through verdant hills
and fertile farmlands

  but then if things happened in places where you ex-
pected them to why there wouldnt be any mystery stories
like this one pretty girls like edith johnwell wouldnt
be going to towns like binghamton asking questions about
the strange case of colonel dwight

iicdith i cried what in the world are you doing

  j here    she was sitting in one of those travel-
ing-salesman leather lounge chairs in the lobby of that
binghamton hotel that looks like a railway station search-
ing for something in her handbag

  i was delighted to see her there edith johnwell was
always decorative and it had otherwise looked like a dull
evening-nine oclock and pouring rain in contrast to
the hotel lobby she looked as smart as a new car

edith was a large girl but streamlined and very nice

  she looked up frowning quizzically im looking for
the mayor of binghamton

  i didnt know he was missing i said

  hes very much missing and his disappearance is
causing me a lot of worry

  well why dont you call up at city hall i asked
maybe hes still in his office or down at the fifth ward
club playing dominoes with some of the boys

edith smiled i dont mean the present mayor silly

 

i mean the mayor who vanished around here about 

  tell me about him i said for an excuse to stay

  edith waved me into a neighboring chair and told me

  she was it seemed writing a series of feature articles
for the new york sun sensational disappearances-you
know elizabeth canning-charlie ross-what happened
to ambrose bierce

  one of the great historic american mysteries was this
disappearance of the former mayor of binghamton it
was shrouded in the dark cloak of a vanishing act and
had more weird angles than the trick box of harry hou-
dini

  edith sketched me the history of the case as anyone
can read it who cares to look it up in the records

chortly after the civil war there arrived in bing-
k- hamton a gentleman who might from his appearance
have put down the rebellion single handed

  he weighed well over two hundred pounds and stood
six feet three in his stocking feet he had a chest like a
cider barrel the voice of a blacksmiths anvil a magnifi-
cent blond beard a lions-mane head of hair and a person-
ality about as shy and retiring as a circus ringmaster

  everything he did with a flourish from taking off his hat
to a lady to signing his name in three-inch letters to a check
you could imagine him stepping off the train at bingham-
ton like a monument about to set itself up on public
square

  binghamton here i am i am colonel walton dwight

  he wasnt any kentucky colonel either he had fought
at gettysburg and he could comb aside his beard and show
some genuine medals binghamton was flattered to be
chosen as the address of so distinguished an officer and
gentleman

  the colonel put a large brass plate on the door of his
business office married a wealthy young lady bought a
rig and a pair of fast horses and set out to enjoy life after
a close brush with death in the civil war

  the colonel had a considerable capacity for enjoyment
too he was as robust as an ox as gallant as a cavalier
and he could crack a joke with the next man in the ma-
hogany grandeur of the mighty dollar bar

  when he slapped someone on the back that person
felt it if he wasnt permanently injured and it wasnt
long before he was sauntering down main street passing
out fat black cigars

  binghamton knew a political power when it saw one

complete short novel
i saw it and burlap saw it-the face beyond the sagging shutters a pale specter black-robed
and there throwing out a handful of moonbeams from the phantom chest was the diamond


argosy

even as big colonel dwight knew a voting community

  he was hardly settled in one of the imposing local man-
sions before he was up on a street-corner platform an-
nouncing himself as a candidate for municipal reform
pointing to the grafters in city hall and calling upon all
good voters to throw the rascals out

  the rascals were thrown out there was a great torch-
light parade led by the firemens band and colonel
dwight in shiny top hat and glossy beard was installed as
the mayor of binghamton the year was somewhere
around 

  the record has it that colonel dwight was prospering
by american standards as well as european standards
the colonel was a great success

  he owned a big many-roomed house with lots of ginger-
bread and a cupola there was an iron jockey in the
driveway iron stags on the lawn a duck pond and a
fountain the house had gaslights and one of those new-
fangled zinc-lined bathtubs amply proportioned for the
colonel

  behind this splendor and opulence was a long series of
business successes the colonel was no pinch-penny oper-
ator stalking into a local bank with as much confidence
as jove calling on a cluster of small-time gods he bor-
rowed three hundred thousand dollars

  it was as hard to borrow money after the civil war as
it is today that was only a small example of the colonels
powers of persuasion

  with the three hundred thousand he purchased a huge
tract of timber in canada and set out to make clothes pins
or something but clothes pins were too picayune an indus-
try for the mayor of binghamton pretty soon he was
buying into pennsylvania coal

  then chicago real estate took his eye and along with
the forests of canada the mines of pennsylvania and the
stockyards of chicago he built a suburb of binghamton
and put up a hotel called the dwight house

  those were just a few side investments indulged in by
the former mayor of binghamton

a t this point in the recital of his honors biography
edith sniffed do you know what he used t say
of himself his favorite expression was that he liked to
bore with a big auger

  he seems to have done all right i said i didnt
know there were ever such opportunities in binghamton
my remark disturbed a fat man in a nearby lounge chair
lowering a newspaper he scowled around a potted fern
at edith and me

  i supposed he was the president of the local go-getters
association and resented us as new york slickers until
i saw him expectorate a cud of tobacco into a convenient
brass gaboon

  only the hotel detective couldve hit the spitton with
such accuracy

  edith ignored him and went on with the story about
the colonel it seems he bored so industriously and on
such a grandoise scale that pretty soon his bank balance
looked like a swiss cheese

  the colonel never did anything in a small way and the
resulting financial crash must have sounded like the col-
lapse of an iron foundry he went magnificently bankrupt
to the tune of four hundred thousand dollars

  perhaps suspecting that he had bored a bigger hole
than he could handle he had meantime doffed the robes of

the lord mayors office and striven mightily to keep his
sieve-like business solvent

  when ones business is tottering it hardly seems the
time to take out life insurance but the colonel seems to
have welcomed with open arms every insurance salesman
who came along

  the record has it that he bought twenty-one policies
from twenty-one different companies and when the crash
arrived the colonel was still assured-or rather life-
insured-for four hundred twenty thousand dollars

t ife insurance companies today would probably hesi-
tate to insure a man with so many separate policies
but back in the s they werent as cautious

  the colonel didnt seem like a bad risk just over
forty he was as healthy hearty and exuberant as an elks
club clam-bake his eyes shone with vim and his whis-
kers flourished like the green bay tree

  bankruptcy didnt seem to dampen him despite the
loss of his property his house and grounds his pair of
matched grays and his iron stag his spirits appeared to
be excellent

  he went in-for winter sports downhearted creditors
were surprised to see him swimming the susquehanna
river on days when the water was like ice just the sight
would have given an ordinary snortal-an insurance agent
say-double pneumonia

  then he was seen tramping the woods in blizzards
plowing through the snow without hat or rubbers he
was likely to leave his bedroom window open at night and
wake up with icicles in his whiskers he refused to put
on his long flannel underwear

  people began to say the colonel was deliberately trying
to catch a bad cold that his rosy-cheeked smile masked
a broken heart that owing four hundred thousand dol-
lars he was out to cash in on his four hundred twenty
thousand dollar life insurance by sending himself to the
undertaker so that his creditors could be paid

  it was a noble gesture but apparently the colonels
physique was better than his good intentions these exer-
cises merely improved his appetite so it got around among
his friends that he was taking overdoses of a drug called
gelsemium

  despite these reported efforts at self-destruction the
colonels health stubbornly improved

  after some months of these unusual goings-on the colo-
nel must have decided to waste no more time he checked
into a downtown hotel invited in numerous friends and
went over his papers he left his insurance policies in
plain sight and told people where they could find his will

  then he did a very curious thing

  calling for the barber he had his hair and beard shorn
away when at last he was bald as a melon and as clean-
shaven as a whistle he bid farewell to a last lingering
friend and shut the door

  the record has it that his friend returning in the morn-
ing was shocked to find the colonel dead as a torkip
hanging by his neck from a bedpost

  that a two-hundred-and-fifty-pounder with the beefy
proportions of the colonel might have difficulty hanging
himself on a bedpost is a fact apparently missed by the
investigators of the time supposedly it was one of those
big old-fashioned eighteen-seventy beds with posts like
telegraph poles

  at any rate the body was cut down by his friend and
his honor is missing



laid out in state funeral arrangements were made the
ceremony to be in keeping with the colonels grandilo-
quent career	

  while the body went to the cemetery amid floral horse-
shoes and gates ajar folks wiped their eyes and blew
their noses and said what a noble man the colonel was
to have taken his own life to pay off his debts

  of course having gone through bankruptcy he didnt
have any legal debts and the insurance money went to
his wifes heirs but the tailor and contractor probably
hoped for a few cents on the dollar

but the colonel didnt rest in peace very long one of
the twenty-one insurance companies seemed to doubt
the validity of the bedpost hanging it telegraphed to
several of the others and two or three more decided they
wouldnt pay the insurance until they had an autopsy

  meantime the will was read and some more peculiarities
were noticed the colonel had never been stingy but
when he willed generous sums of money to the boys around
city hall the legacy began to look queer

  especially queer was a bequest of five thousand dollars
to the coroner who examined his remains and ten thousand
dollars to the surrogate who handled the will

  while lawyers were staring in surprise at this largesse
a medical examiner of state-wide reputation was called
in from albany this doctor hurried to look at the body
which had now been returned to the morgue

  after a brief but exciting autopsy he declared that he
could not swear it was the body of colonel dwight

  the colonels heirs insisted it was the colonels body
and the albany doctor was equally insistent that it wasnt
people said well sir can you beat that

  the insurance companies said if it isnt the colonels
body then he isnt dead and well be darned if well come
across with four hundred twenty thousand dollars worth
of life insurance

  binghamton was in a stew some said it was the colo-
nel all right but he didnt look familiar because hed
harvested his gorgeous whiskers

  others said it wasnt the colonel at all but some bogus
colonel that had been supplied by the city morgue these
doubters suggested that the colonel had clipped his whis-
kers to facilitate a getaway that his friends had substitut-
ed a ringer and staged a phoney funeral

  while all this wrangling was going on a report came
that the ex-mayor of binghamton had been seen on his
way to mexico those contesting the insurance companies
answered with a claim that the colonel had been taking
a peculiar drug which altered his appearance after death

  so there were those who said the colonel was dead and
there were those who said he wasnt in the end the
insurance companies said he wasnt and they won the case

  the colonels estate didnt collect the four hundred
twenty thousand dollars

but if the colonel wasnt dead where was he who
was the poor devil found hanging to the bedpost
from that day to this nobody seems to know

  reports came in for a long time afterward that the colo-
nel with a fresh growth of whiskers had been seen around
mexico cuba and the hot spots of south america but
no one could establish these reports as true

  it was never proved whether the colonel went to mexico
or the beyond

akgosy march is 

  such are the historical facts concerning the one-time
mayor of binghamton-history as edith told it to me
that night in the hotel lobby-as you yourself can read
it if you care to look up the records

  then she told me some angles that arent in the records

  that happened about seventy years ago she whis-
pered and the colonel has been missing from that day
to this

  she paused and as if timed to a cue the night was
shaken by a wooden rumble of thunder electricity flut-
tered in the rain-swept street and a spate of wind-blown
water whipped against the lobby windows

  charlie ediths voice was low-what would you
say if i told you that im going to see this ex-mayor of
binghamton

  from here on this story-as the novelists say-bears
no resemblance to anyone living or dead

         chapter ii	y-

             man out of darkness

t dont know why ediths voice put a creep through
my hair but it sort of went with the rain-gust and the
shakespearean accompaniment of thunder

  binghamton was blacked out with one of those summer
night thunderstorms that short-circuited the street lamps
and clear the square of traffic and drive pedestrians in-
doors it was the sort of night to meet a mayor who had
disappeared mysteriously seventy years ago

  edith had lowered her head to light a cigarette our
corner seemed remote from the rest of the lobby where
cigar smoke stagnated over the usual chairs and business
men hobnobbed with the desk clerk

  in a taproom at the back a juke box was playing and
a bellhop came through paging somebody named mr
dinglehoofer

  edith said leaning toward me by the way charlie
if all this is boring you-

  i havent got a thing to do i protested how about
finishing it in the bar where we can get a drink

  i cant im waiting here for somebody

  her voice underlined the somebody and there was
another crash of thunder outside and i had another creep
ediths eyes went past me dilated and i looked around
half expecting to see the missing mayor

  of course he wasnt there and of course it was just
ediths way of telling a story she loved mysteries and
she had a knack at spinning words which was why the
newspaper had assigned her to this sort of stuff

  i could see someone else who wasnt bored by the story
too that fat goop in the chair around the corner of the
potted plant ever so often hed lower his paper and
sneak a sidewise look

  i decided he was the house dick and i supposed he
thought i was trying to pick edith up

  in which case incidentally he was right id spent
four years trying to pick up edith that she was still
on a newspaper while i was a bachelor advertising sales-
man shows how much magnetism i didnt have

  well ediths manner was confidential-ive spent
a week here in binghamton going over the records and
ive found some interesting things about this old mayor
of binghamton

  what kind of things

                    i


argosy

  nothing in the records the city historian of the
period seems tove edited a lot of the case i fancy they
felt a little hoaxed and the consensus was that he pulled
a vanishing act and made a getaway

  so it sounds from the evidence

  yes edith agreed if he werent up to flimflam why
would heve barbered his beautiful beard i think the
colonel parted with his whiskers because the substitute
corpse didnt have any besides it would account for the
substitutes face looking different

  also a man about to commit suicide doesnt spend
money for a shave and a haircut and without his whis-
kers it wouldve been easier to slip out of town

  thats the way folks reasoned at the time ive met
some old-timers who claim to remember the colonel and
they agree that that whisker business was mighty queer

  the colonels vanishment has become a sort of legend
around here and according to the legend that beard was
one of the three things he prized most in the world

  what were the other two i asked

 a ccording to the legend-edith emphasized the
phrase-the second thing he prized was an oil
painting a portrait naturally of himself being a man
who liked to bore with a big auger the colonel was just
the sort to have his portrait painted full length

  and the third thing hes supposed to have prized-
her voice dropped to alto-was a diamond

  i echoed a diamond

  edith said shhhhh and looked around then she
leaned toward me big-eyed a regular bonanza she
whispered in one of those womans whispers that carry
louder than ordinary conversation

  bigger than a peach pit theres nothing about it in
the records you know its just one of the legendary
tales about the colonel that he disappeared with this enor-
mous diamond

  the kind of sparkler any sensible girl would accept
in an engagement ring i suggested the remark was
supposed to remind edith of a diamond not quite as
mammoth but twice as well-intended which i had been
frustratedly offering her

  she frowned then ignored the suggestion

  the story is that this diamond was worth all of thirty
thousand dollars i cant find anybody who ever saw it
on the colonel but some of the old men hereabouts say
they heard about it on the colonel id say it fitted with
his character though

  if a man were going bankrupt and planning a vanish-
ing act a diamond would be a handy thing to vanish with
you cant cash worthless checks in mexico but a diamond

  edith drew a long breath stared out of the lobby win-
dow at the black rain a diamond is good anywhere
i nodded vigorously

  if you know where i reminded thinking of her
finger

  edith gave me another dilated look charlie she
said alto again i think im going to see it tonight
i gulped what

  she whispered i told you i was going to see the ex-
mayor

  i said you mean hes come back

  perhaps she said in a low voice he never went
away

thunder fell down a staircase in the night outside
- and crashed as if on some nearby church steeple the
lobby lights dimmed and flickered and the street disap-
peared in black cloudburst

  ediths voice came in mysterioso ive heard a story
that the colonel never left town that he vanished no far-
ther than an old house near binghamton-an old deserted
house on an island in the middle of the susquehanna
river

  the story goes that he lived there as a recluse with
the windows shuttered and the blinds down and a big
black dog to keep unwanted visitors away they say a
boat used to put out from shore-a veiled woman in a
black cape who took him food

  they say he lived there charlie and died there but
the house is still haunted by the colonel and his dog they
say and hes been seen at the window in his lord mayors
robes with his curly yellow beard and his diamond his
living ghost

  his ghost at that i wanted to laugh of course
thered be a ghost men like that in towns surrounded by
rural countryside always leave a ghost i grinned the
qld gray mayor	

  edith rebuked my levity by tightening the corners of her
mouth listen she leaned toward me it isnt funny
from the history of the case i think he pulled a stunt

it seems plausible enough why else would he have parted
with his beloved whiskers

  he might easily have sneaked off in the night to this
desolate river-island hide-out the woman in black seems
plausible too

  ive talked with three old farmers who say they saw 
her they say the colonel planned to go to foreign parts
when the insurance money was settled but when the fake
corpse was exposed he didnt dare risk going any farther

  not only that i talked with one farmer who says his
father saw the substituted corpse and knows it wasnt the
colonel this farmer claims his father was one of the
grave-diggers see

  she waited for another thunder-crack to calm down

  i protested edith there were probably all kinds of
rumors-legends bigger with every telling-

  i believe them she said throatily thats not all
some men went out to that haunted house charlie the
story says there were five in all they rowed out to the
island after that diamond you can bet thered be plenty
of men whod give their souls for a diamond like that

  they gave their souls for it too the legend says
they never came back every one of the five was found
drowned in the river below the island

  sure i jibed haunted house ghost at the window
treasure-hunt after a diamond anybody unfortunate
enough to drown in the river near the haunted island
and he was murdered by the spook

  are you going to tell me i demanded that you
believe in ghosts

  edith gave me a steady caustic look did i say i
believed in ghosts she shpok her head i said the
farmers around here claimed theyd seen a ghost the
man whos coming here tonight claims he saw it just a
week ago i believe he saw something

  edith lowered her voice tensely i believe the colo-
nel is still alive

  there was a loud interruption of thunder and every
lamp in the lobby went out blue lightning flickered
his honor is missing



around in the street glaring into the windows weirdly

ediths face was bleak and queer in the lightning flares

   she was saying i believe the ghost they see is the colo-
nel himself he was forty when he disappeared hed
be now about a hundred and ten years old

  the lobby lights came on as suddenly as theyd been
extinguished the room hopped back into view people
blinking at each other from their chairs and at the lobby
desk the fat man behind the fern adjusting his glasses
and lifting his newspaper

  but there was a man standing at the side of ediths
chair a creature who might have been conjured by the
momentary darkness or swept in on the wings of the
rainstorm from outside

  he had ears like wings and a long bony face above a
long bony neck with a big adams apple eyes like holes
full of rainwater peered weakly under a dripping hatbrim

  his clothes hung drenched and gaunt as the garb on a
scarecrow his storm-rubbers were caked with mud he
carried a weeping umbrella but it wasnt chamberlain

  miss johnwell

  edith jumped up good i was afraid you werent
coming

  wasnt sure youd want to go its a-rainin powerful
hard an i reckon th river may be close to flooded

  ill get my waterproof edith said goodbye char-
lie she turned to me this is the gentleman going to
escort me to the place i told you about

  goodbye nothing i said looking at this soaked
and dripping rustic i was thinking of five men mysteri-
ously drowned in the spectre-haunted river wait till
i get my hat im going too

chapter iii

charons ferry

looking back now i wonder whether i wasnt in a
way shanghaied edith said she didnt want me to
go she wouldnt wait for me to go around to the garage
and fetch my car she insisted that id crowd her escorts
flivver and she said she didnt want me interfering with
her business

   but of course she knew id go

   i have an idea she was a little scared about this mayor-
hunt on such a stormy night that shed deliberately stirred
up my masculine protective instinct with her story and
was darned glad id happened along for company

  that diamond angle was a good piece of luring too
im as much a sucker for a treasure hunt as the next man
and edith didnt neglect to put that on the hook

  anyway and willy-nilly the next thing i knew i was
out of the hotel and across a long bridge and driving out
along a country road out of binghamton in the worst
rainstorm id ever experienced and in the worst car

  three was a crowd in that jalopy the body was a
saxon but the gear-shift and engine were from a ford
model t the lamps and wheels were from a maxwell
and the other spare parts went back to prehistoric days
of the automotive industry

  our chauffeur like his car seemed made of assorted
spare parts these were distributed over half the pas-
senger space his head was bowed to the roof his shoul-
ders were hunched over the steering wheel knees jockeyed
up on either side of the wheel and elbows splayed

  what with his ears his umbrella his feet a peck of
potatoes loose on the floorboards and various farm imple-
ments stowed behind the seat the coupe was already
cramped when edith and i squeezed in

  nobody ever said edith didnt have hips so she sat
on me

  i told you not to come she complained

   its all right with me i assured her id never been
able to entice her on my knee in more comfortable cir-
cumstances and ill admit it was another reason for my
joining the expedition

  before starting she introduced me to our guide clyde
burlap he shook hands gravely and prepared himself
against the journey with a great chaw of chewing tobacco
-iron horse

  i dont think either edith or i knew what we were get-
ting into when we got into that car for my own part
i didnt think we would get very far but at that the
rattletrap went at a remarkable pace

  thirty-five miles an hour in that hazardous hybrid was
the fastest ride i ever had bolts rattling springs squeak-
ing the bus shook along through the rain chattering as
if with ague

  every next turn i expected the engine to drop out or a
wheel to snap off

  the road was black as your hat and the fizzing head-
lamps barely penetrated the downpour sheets of water
swept over the hood as we hit flooded ruts rain beat
through the roof like a mist coming through a cotton um-
brella

  our driver addressed his vehicle as if it were a nag
whoa as it slowed for a turn giddyap as it started
up a hill gwan you when he shoved it into low and
it faltered

  aint exactly a cadillac he informed me but give
her her own leeway an shell git there reckon shell pass
anything on th road tonight

rphere wasnt anything on the road for her to pass

    presently we left the main highway and turned down
a hilly wagon-road and there was less

  you couldnt see the roadsides for the rain and dark-
ness and after a couple of miles i began to wonder if
we hadnt gone off the map

   cant scarcely see fer this weather mr burlap peered
with his nose against the windshield but jessie cn find
her way like she does it by instinct shes a native to these
parts like i am

  in reply to my question about jessie he informed me
that jessie was the car named her after a horse i had
in the old buggy days and shes nigh as old too horse
jessie died at thirty-six an theres parts of this here
jessie near to thirty-five

  but shell get us where we want to git mister dont
worry about jessie

  i wasnt worried about jessie i was worried about
edith and me barging off in that broken-down jalopy with
this farmer in a thunder storm i could see the road ahead
going downhill like a brown torrent it was a desolate
landscape and binghamton seemed a hundred miles away

  dont get stuck edith warned youre sure you
know the way

  sure do burlap declared were a-headin south
on what i call the ole back road follerin down th
susquehanna valley aint used much this road count


argosy

of its bad my pa told me back in th old days that
colonel dwight use to drive it in his rig sometimes on
sunday

    pas farm was on th hill up there to th left-that is
 before he give up farmin to become a grave-digger

   rain swooped around  the car edith had to raise her
 voice at my ear to be heard

   mr burlaps father is the man i told you about-said
 he saw the body at the ex-mayors funeral and claimed it
 wasnt that of the colonel

   is that so i shouted

   yes sir the farmer nodded steering the car around
 a sharp turn and digging an elbow into my ribs pa was
 right there at th grave-side when th coffin was re-
 opened fer th autopsy pa said it wasnt th colonel an
 he knowed for sure it wasnt th colonel on account of th
 hair

 we skidded down through a gully where the under-
  brush was so thick it slashed the sides of jessies
 saxon body mud splattered up over the fenders plaster-
 ing the windshield the tires spun in paste then found
 traction in gravel

    our driver shouted giddyap  as jessie almost bogged
 and i waited for the engine to pull ahead before asking
 my question

   how could he tell by the hair i thought the colonel
 shaved off his hair and whiskers

   sure he did burlap agreed an th body that was
 buried had its hair and whiskers barbered likewise must
 been a vagrant at the morgue see that was rigged up in
 the colonels clothes and hanged to th bedpost to look
 like him

    all right then it was biftied an some days later dug
 up again it had hair when it was dug up my pa says
 he seen it fine reddish hair

   but the colonels hair was yellow th hair on th

  corpse was reddish ysee th hair of your corpse keeps
 on growin even after youre dead

   he cranked down the window at his elbow to spit out
 a streak of tobacco juice rain and wind and some of the
 tobacco juice gusted back into my face

   i guessed we were about ten miles out of binghamton
 and i wished we were back edith was getting pretty
 heavy but she had an arm around my neck which helped
 some it was warm though and wet and stuffy and un-
 comfortable

   burlap kept up a bovine chewing noise peering to see
 the road and clucking now and then at the car

   then he jerked a thumb at a roadside mail box in rusty
 abandonment atop a post

   theres the old dinkloofer farm gone to grass now
 there was a son but he run away with a circus when he
 was a kid an he didnt never come back an lay claim
 to the place an its et up with taxes

   aint no one lived there for years no sir the son
 never come back not after what happened to the old
 man

   the comment seemed more significant than remini-
 scence i waited for our escort to explain

   edith said that was one of the five

   burlap ran down the window to spit yes sir he
 nodded wristing his mouth to complete the operation
 that was one of the five

   one of the five what i asked the name dinkloofer

 sounded somehow vaguely familiar i was trying to think
 back and locate it

ne of th five who was drowned burlaps voice
 went suddenly basso one of th five who went
out to th island a-huntin the mayors diamond sparkler
an didnt never come back old man dinkloofer was the
first

  edith urged tell charlie about it mr burlap he
doesnt quite believe the story

  dont know whether i believe it all myself was the
answer ifn i did i dont reckon id be takin you there
miss not fer five dollars ner fer five thousand dollars

  but theres been some mighty queer goins on about
that island an it started back about fifty years ago
started with people sayin they seen a woman in black row
out there an th rumor that th missin colonel had this
diamond	i

  but-whoa jessie he pulled up the car tell you
about it goin out there here we are

  to this day i dont know where we were somewhere
on the susquehanna river i suppose the car stopped in
a nest of bushes between two huge black trees

  there was a flash and a crack of thunder and i glimpsed
a mud bank and a dock and a rushing sweep of water
that seemed as wide as the mississippi in the rainblur

  a rowboat and a muddy scow were tethered to the dock
and in a second flash of lightning i glimpsed a string of
channel islands far out in the middle of the river i dont
say it was as wide as the mississippi but in the rain and
stormy dark with the water sweeping by at high flood it
seemed that way

  we got out in the soup and i didnt want to go but
our escort lit a lantern and led us down to the boats and
ediths eyes were shining with excitement and adventure

  burlap bailed out and untied the rowboat and i remem-
ber him saying we were at someone-or-others ferry i
was thinking of charons ferry

  gaunt and shadowy in the lantern-light burlap was
charons boatman we were out to find a lost soul and
the river was as black and forbidding as the river styx

chapter iv

the five

tjurlap chewed bailed rowed and told us about
dinkloofer as our boat edged out into the river

  it was the diamond that fetched old man dinkloofer
he was a dutchman ysee an dutchmen have a yen for
diamonds mind you he wasnt the only one

  thunder interrupted with a crash rain blew in flat
streaks across the water blinding the night swept out
into the channel our flatbottom boat pitched and rocked
our boatman swore spat and strained at the oars
about dinkloofer heresumed he was the one who
started it when he heard that the colonel had piked
off with a valble gem he told my pa he knowed where
it was

  ysee it was old man dinkloofer whod seen th woman
in black rowin downriver to this island dinkloofer he
follered her one time to see where she was a-goin an he
seen her stop at this island an go into the ole haunted
house

it was dinkloofer first claimed he seen the ex-mayors
his honor

face at an upper window one moonlit night its the colo-
nels ghost he told my pa if his ghost is there that
diamond may be there too sometime im a-goin to take
a look

  go on edith said breathlessly as burlap halted to
stuff his marsupial cheek with fresh tobacco tell what
happened to dinkloofer

  well sir one night he set out it was a bad night
burlap said cheerlessly kind of like tonight ole man
dinkloofer told the neighbors he was goin out after bull-
heads but everybody knowed twasnt the kind of night
to go out fishin fer bullheads

  dinkloofer rowed out to th island to that haunted
house they found his boat there afterwards but they
didnt find ole man dinkloofer there they found him
down near the rapids at medwicks mill

  floatin in the millrace he was drowned as a mush-
rat

  burlap spat overside in finality and as he bent to the
oars i couldnt help looking off through the rainstorm in
apprehension tons of water surged past us in the dark
rain beat down on our heads edith and i were huddled
together soaked

 the next one was gawzberry burlap drawled the
name jed gawzberry as used to be a farm hand on
the west side of th stream jed got the bee in his bonnet
hed like to get his hands on th colonels sparkler an he
come a-rowin out one night to look fer it too

  he didnt tell no one but his sister an his sister told
it afterwards at jeds inquest

  he didnt git th jewel either he was found days
afterwards by the mill downstream when a fisherman
hooked him up outa th mud jed had been drownded
too

  bending to the oars our narrator pulled a dozen deep
strokes his eyes were closed in memory he was hum-
ming down by the old mill stream

  i didnt like any of it but edith was crouched for-
ward peering into the night ahead with eyes as bright
as if she saw pirates treasure tell charlie about
big ben

atessir burlap nodded yessir there was big
ben he was a blacksmith ysee down at what
they used to call riverbend point-a big husky feller
who could bend a horseshoe with one hand

  he wasnt afraid of nothin an he said he didnt
give a hang about th give a hang about th colonels ghost
he was goin to find that diamond an he didnt give a
whoop who knowed it

  he rowed out to the island one halloween night when
no one in the county dast join him on a dare well sir
they waited all night but he didnt come back

  the ice was early that winter an they never did find
him till the follerin spring he popped up down there
by medwicks mill too

  i had an idea that if we kept on with this harebrained
business i might pop up down by medwicks mill myself
our guide went on to say that big bens pop-uppance
had occurred twenty years ago and that it was a long
time afterward before the country people would venture
anywhere near the haunted island

  but folks jest couldnt forget that diamond it was
said to be a whopper an it kind of stuck in peoples craw
they figgered the colonel wouldve owned such a gewgaw

is missing	

bein a politician like he was an thirty thousand dollars
is a heap of money to us farmers hereabouts

  only it wasnt a farmer who went after it next it
was a feller from th city whod once took in th colonels
laundry a smart old chinaman named ching

  ching ching chinaman he too it seemed had
conceived a belief in the colonels bonanza he too had
boated past the island on numerous occasions and wit-
nessed the vanished mans face at the window

  he too had declared his intention of visiting the in-
sular house and he too for all his undoubted oriental
craft and what burlap called heathen familiarity with
witches had floated up in the vicinity of medwicks
mill thoroughly drowned

  id had enough of it puffing spitting hauling at the
oars burlap had all he could do to keep our craft from
being whirled downstream without diverting us with a
bedtime story

  that river was certainly high swollen by cloudbursts
the current was running as if a dam had broken some-
where displays of aerial electricity revealed glimpses
of the racing tide uprooted bushes driftwood and water-
logged timbers swirled around our boat i know flood-
water when i see it

  lets go back i muttered to edith its not safe
out here on a night like this this rivers rising to a flood

  she didnt hear me our nocturnal boatman was adding
a fifth face to his collection of the drowned

eller named strool he wasnt a binghamtonite

  - ner native to these parts after what happened to
the chink an those others you couldnt git nobody
hereabouts to go within a mile of that island house

  nossir us folks who knowed about it steered clear of
the place diamond er no diamond but this feller
strool he use to come through here summers with the
chautauqua

  cornin year after year they git to know the coun-
tryfolk pretty personal an i reckon thats where pro-
fessor strool-they called him professor-got wind of
colonel dwights ghost an the hawg-size diamond

  burlap wiped rain from his eyes shook his head at
the memory smart feller strool was too mighty
smart wore nose glasses with a ribbon an a flowin
black tie

  he give readins on some guy named shakespeare-all
about witches an spooks an some scotch murderer named
macbeth like to make your hair curl

  but i recollect hearin him once tell an audience he
didnt really believe in spooks they was jest eye-magina-
tion

  trouble was he had this goitre one of the kind-
burlap gestured in the lantern light-grows out like a
summer squash

  strool tried to hide it with his big professors tie
but i reckon it growed too large for him naturally he
couldnt go on readin about macbeth with a thing like
that

  i gulped naturally

  so i figger-burlap wagged his chin-he was get-
tin ready to re-tire hadnt saved no money likely an
he needed a heap to keep himself an his goitre heard
about the missin colonel an his sparkler an reckoned
hed like to find such a gem sooo- he mooed the
word suggestively


argosy

   so strool also rowed out to the mayor-haunted island
strool also dared the colonels phantom for the rumored
gem strool also was found in the rapids down below
medwicks mill

  and that happened just last summer burlaps voice
drifted at me through the rain last summer about this
time of year of course the sheriff an police investigated

   he snorted but th sheriff an police are city folks
an they dont know nothin no-how drowned by acci-
dent they called it same as all the other drowndins out
here where the currents swift in th river

  they-burlap expectorated scornfully-claim that
the boats tipped over in th channel or the men was
drownded in swimmin or something medwicks mill is
four miles below this island and they say the bodies was
carried down by the current

  they come out an looked at the haunted house but
they was mighty careful to do it in the daytime i notice
an us country people knows you dont see ghosts in
the daytime

   nossir you see em at night just like i seen th col-
onels ghost myself-at the window-with his yellow
beard and mayors robes an the diamond flarin on his
chest like a cats eye-an i heard th black dog howlin
too

   burlap peered at me waterishly across the oar-handles
that was only last week

chapter v

the black dog howls

dainwater turned to icewater running down my
spine it was eerie out there on that black storm-
swept river damned eerie its one thing to have a
farmer tell you ghost stories from forty years ago or
even last year another thing to have him tell you hes
seen the bugaboo last week

   our boatman looked as if hed seen it for a fact

  yessir i was in this very boat a-rowin down to
riverbend point i was to call on my aunt hattie whos
my only livin relative well i didnt look where i was
a-rowin count of i had a line out for carp an i rowed
right close to the island

  say it was bright moonlight an i looked around
an i was driftin right past th ole house there it was
at a third-story window

  plain as anything in th moonlight lookin at me
through th broken shutters th face of th missin
mayor

  burlap wiped his tobacco-juicy mouth and neighed a
nervous laugh durn near capsized myself in this boat
he blurted scairt the liver an lights clean outa me
got on down to aunt hatties so fast the oar-locks was
smokin	

   when i told aunt hat about it she told me shed seen
the colonels face herself a couple of times huh

  he broke off to tug at the oars the rain had stopped
suddenly and the thunder had retreated into distance
where lightning flashes played across far-off night

   when the sky-flares flickered out the river completely
disappeared there was only the sound of swirling cur-
rents and sloshing oar-blades

we drifted with our lantern through black invisibility

it was th missin colonel all right burlap nodded at

edith reckanized him from pas description seen
th diamond winkin under his whiskers an just as i
pulled away there was that awful dog-howl it was like
i told it in th barber shop last saturday night

see young feller-he blinked at me-i come to
town last saturday night to git my seasonal hair-
cut i was tellin th barber how id seen th colonels
ghost the night before an your girl was in there an she
collared me shed come in to ask th barber if ole colonel
dwight had ever left any shavin mug around bingham-
ton an she tells me shes writin a history of th colonel

  i asked mr burlap to help me edtih said i
promised him five dollars if hed bring me out to this
island

  yessir our boatman agreed an i wouldnt a-done
it ifn she hadnt told me somethin i was thinkin all
along i aint sayin i dont believe in ghosts ive seen
too many of em

  but the girl is right young feller it wasnt no
ghost that sent ole man dinkloofer an jed gawzberry
an big ben an ching an professor strool to a watery
grave

  nossir burlap spat a brown streak in conviction
ghosts dont ever kill anybody

  what do you think did happen to those five men
i muttered

  burlap feathered the oars and blinked at me i think
they was drownded sure enough but the colonels ghost
didnt do it i recollect my pa tellin me that the colonel
after he went bankrupt started takin some queer drug

  pa said it was gelsemium-an gelsemium comes from
th root of jasmine they say its a mighty queer drug

  yes edith nodded there was a rumor he took
gelsemium

  yeah-clyde burlap shifted his cud-an ive hearn
tell that if you take enough of it its a sort of preservative
like thats what pa said an pa was a grave-digger an
ought tove knowed

  if you take enough of this drug you dont ever die
so i think the colonels out here on this island sure
enough i think hes still alive

  it was nonsense of course theres no such thing as
a drug to keep you alive if this ridiculous colonel were
a hundred and ten years old he wouldnt have any yellow
whiskers to show at a window and the rats in an old
house would have eaten him up long ago

  we were risking our necks on this flooded river in a
leaky tub for a lot of fiddlefaddle i was mad at edith
for coming with this ignorant bumpkin and mad at my-
self for letting her come

  then our guide said something that made me madder

titthe colonels still alive an it musta been him who
drownded those others thats why i aint takin
any chances so i brought pas gun

  fishing under his coat he produced the weapon and
laid it across his knee a rusty long-barreled horse pistol
that looked as if it hadnt been fired since the civil war

  in the lantern-glimmer his eyes wer sly he gave a
confidential laugh i guess i aint so dumb even if
they do call me crazy clyde

  i felt edith stiffen at my side crazy clyde i guess
that was a little more than she had bargained for

  do they call you that her voice was dismayed
his honor is missing



  he smiled at us over the oar handles its jest that
they say i aint quite bright becuz at seventeen i was
still in the second grade it wasnt that i wasnt smart
though

  he chuckled i never did tell em it was becuz i
liked the teacher thats why i stayed in th second
grade when i couldve gone on

  hells bells other people say theyre bright but
jest look at the state the worlds in if theyre so all-
fired smart howd they come to elect a mayor in bingham-
ton like this colonel

  he laughed cheerfully but there was somethin
wrong with ma run in her family an when i was
six years old i was kicked in the head by a horse

  he took off his hat and leaned forward want to
feel th dent

  i reached out quickly and he jerked back quicker
set down youre rockin the boat he said reproach-
fully holding the gun beyond my snatch he stuffed it
back into his shirt ill carry th hoss pistol young
feller dont worry taint loaded aint no bullets been
made to fit it fer fifty years

mr burlap i ordered take us back to the dock
no edith countered firmly go on to the island
youre a-payin me he nodded at edith working the
oars reckon i aint too dim-witted to know where th
money is anyway here we be

  bullrushes were scraping the gunwales as our boatman
shipped the oars the flatbottom grounded on mud and
there we were

  i was mad as a hatter edith and i and a fool with an
empty gun on a flooded mid-river island looking for the
little mayor who wasnt there

  just as we landed there was a terrific clap of thunder
and the whole sky was zigzagged with lightning like
cracks in a black easter egg

  we saw the house a black-roofed beetling silhouette
beyond a jungle of crooked-limbed inky trees

  lightning short-circuited into blackness and the thun-
der rolled away and there was only the swash of the river
and pitch darkness and the furtive whisper of rainwater
guttering and draining through soaked underbrush

  but silly or not burlaps eyes in that lightning flare
had spied something missed by mine

  grabbing the lantern he went up the mud-bank with
a cry when we caught up with him he was pawing a
sodden bundle from under a bush clothes

  a suit of mens clothes we gaped at them under
the lantern a voluminous pair of pants-an oversized
coat-and i remember a pair of number twelve endicott-
johnson shoes they were water-soaked and shapeless
and tied in a bundle by a belt the initial on the belt-
buckle was d

  my hair went up the buckle wasnt rusty what
large individual had but recently divested himself of
these garments and left them here

  d edith gasped d for dwight colonel walton
dwight

  that wasnt the time to hear the funeral howl of a dog

ahoooo    word of honor that howl coming out
of the black almost lifted the forelock off my head
good guh-gosh i said

  edith got around behind me and clung what was
thaaaat

  crazy clyde burlap dropped the vacant clothes and
reared up in fright his voice was half way between a
sermon and a moan its the black dog the black
dog of the colonel that for seventy years has kept guard
over the island

  and the colonels here too edith pointed at the
outsize pants coat and shoes

  somewhere in the dark burlap stared around bogle-
eyed somewhere in th night an he aint got his
clothes on

  that was too much to contemplate and we ran as if
by common consent down the mud-bank pellmell back
to the boat

  only the boat wasnt there we stood at the waters
edge frantic while burlap wildly waved the lantern
the gleams gave glimpse of the sweeping brown current
surging through a wall of night-no boat

  waves purling through the rushes told the story no
one had bothered to tie up the craft the river had risen
inches while we examined that ghoulish bundle of clothes
our boat had departed by itself

  that wasnt all i saw our means of departure having
departed we were marooned-on an island in the middle
of a run-away river that was swelling higher every minute

  swimming that wild current was out of the question
and it looked as if we were in for a night of it stuck
out there in mid-river with a haunted house a black dog
an unclad ghost and heaven knew what other hocus-
pocus in the offing

chapter vi

the colonels face

tjurlap whimpered whatre we gonna do and i
was mad enough to kick him into the drink the
boat floating off was just about the last straw

  do i snapped well we arent going to stand on
this mud bank while the tide climbs up our legs and wait
for dawn how wide is this river

  we couldnt never swim it he sniffled that channel
out theres mighty swift th rivers flooded from all
these rains powerful heap of water cornin down aint
no way fer us to get back now

  he stared about in desperation tobacco juice leaking
from the corner of his mouth gee whillakers itll be
all up with us ngw if we meet thecolonel

  nuts i swore i was getting a grip on myself we
arent going to meet any hundred-and-ten year old colonel
and we arent going to meet any seventy-year-old watch-
dog were going to see if theres anyone around that
house and find out who owns those clothes

  some swimmer or hobo left them there-about five
million names in the telephone book begin with d-and
lots of men wear suits that size while were looking
around we can look for another boat too

  as for the dog its some stray hound thats swum
out here sure i snapped baying at the moon

  i pointed up at a rift in the sky where black clouds
had torn apart and left a hole greenish moonlight fil-
tered through as i spoke and trees and river came dimly
into view like a photograph developing on a dark watery
film

  talking loudly i was getting -back my confidence

i rasped at burlap give me the lantern and give


argosy

 me that gun i glared at him holding out my hand

   he complied meekly enough handing over the lantern
 and disgorging from his shirt the rusty weapon

   good edith pressed my arm she rounded deter-
 minedly her chin out firm i was afraid we were going
 to run away its silly how a dog-howl can scare you
 isnt it come all this way and be scared by some old
 dog

   i was sore at myself for being panicked but it wasnt
 the dog that had scared me as much as the clothes some-
 thing crummy about an unexplained suit of clothes on a
 river bank

   that night on that particular island it was even crum-
 mier there was something lonesome about that coat
 those pants and shoes something uncanny as if the
 man in them had just evaporated

   the wearer had been a big man too-bigger than or-
 dinary too big to just evaporate about the size i im-
 agined of the two-hundred-and-fifty-pound colonel

   going up the mud bank i gave those empty clothes
 a wide berth

   its just some stray hound i made my mind change
 the subject no dog could live for seventy years here
 burlap where does this path go

 tte sidled up to stare at the footpath the lantern
 had discovered in the bushes it was weedy half
 concealed in grass and myrtle i was relieved not to see
 any tracks

   looks like it goes to the house burlap tremulously
 observed i dont know mister i aint never been ashore
 on this island

   stick close behind me edith i said come on

   we moved up the path single file underbrush was tall
 on either side black and dank smoky moonlight slanted
 down through the crooked wet branches of pathside trees

   i pouldnt see the house from here in the jungle of
 weeds and wet brush i couldnt see anything

   i didnt hurry you dont get much confidence out of a
 rusted horse pistol and i let the lantern light go on ahead

   burlap spoke a thought which had formed in his dented
 skull

   maybe he give it some of that gelsemium drug too

   i rasped over my shoulder who gave what

   maybe the colonel gave gelsemium to his dog thats
 how it could still be alive burlap croaked in a raven-
 like undertone work with the colonel it ought to work
 with a dog

   i wheeled around listen you ive had enough of
 your ghost story for one evening the thing to do now is
 find a boat or some way to get us out of here i dont
 care if the colonel drank egyptian embalming fluid or the
 fountain of youth-if he scrammed out of binghamton
 at the age of forty back in the s he isnt around
 here today

   that-i glared at edith-goes for you too

   then who left them clothes back there on the bank
 burlap asked in a quaver who drowned the ole dutch-
 man an jed gawzberry an big ben the blacksmith an
 ching the laundry man ah professor strool whose
 curly-bearded face did i see last week at an upper story
 window

 t had to remind myself that they called him crazy

   clyde his lank face was foolish with fear as he craned

 and peered around in the moony dark he almost gibbered

   in a situation like that it isnt comforting to know your
guide is just a little brighter than the village idiot no
telling what part of his story was true and what part was
star-dust

  why had i ever let edith come on this crackpotted
ghost-chase looking at her there i knew i ought to
have my own head examined for dents

  she whispered go on charlie go on

  i set my jaw and went on i wasnt anxious to meet
any unclothed athlete the size of the man who had worn
those pants but moving was better than standing and
i hoped that somewhere around we might find another
boat

  burlap halted suddenly behind edith someone has
been livin on this island look theyve growed a gar-
den potatoes antheres wild corn

  it was a pretty sorry garden stunted corn and a few
wormy plants in a patch of weeds-mere evidence that
the plot had been under cultivation at some past time

   the corn had degenerated to stalks and silk yet some-
body mustve once planted it there it was somehow lonely
and ghostly like the dogs howl and that vacant pair of
trousers

  it was him burlap panted the ex-mayor of bing-
hamton who hid there on this island ands still keepin his-
self an his dog alive on gelsemium

 i snarled nuts to that gelsemium stuff

  charlie its true edith whispered there is such
a drug i looked it up in the dictionary it comes from
jasmine root as mr burlap said and its in the records
that the colonel was taking it there was a lot of talk
about it at the time

  see her fingers gripped my arm theres some
jasmime growing there in the corn right now

   in the wet dark we could smell it that nocturnal-flow-
ered bush flourishing in that shabby garden to this day
the smell of flowering jasmine at night gives me a creep
i can see that bush in that corn-patch and edith staring
at it with dilated eyes

  yellow jasmine thats where the drug comes from
maybe the colonel-maybe the colonel made his own
gelsemium 

  v

t had a mental picture of the colonel out here in his
- island hide-out compounding his own drug living on
and on and on i said nuts but i could see edith was
pretty convinced i couldnt tell her that jasmine was likely
to grow anywhere

  burlap was convinced too he was shaking like a
scarecrow in a wind

  you can argue with a dunce who never got out of the
second grade because he liked the teacher but you cant
argue with a girl like edith

  go to the house edith prodded me charlie i
want to find out

   i should have spanked her but i guess i wanted to find
out myself i was thinking as we crept up the path
that maybe there was something to this colonel-and-dia-
mond story

  maybe the bankrupt ex-mayor of binghamton had
absconded to this island lair lived here as a recluse in
majestic seclusion 

  not that he could still be living but he might have
planted jasmine at that and tried to keep going on this
his honor is missing



phoney drug maybe he had planted this stuff years ago

  if hed been here at all i was thinking maybe that
diamond was here diamonds dont wear out even if
politicians do

  which shows you the thin line of distinction between
bughouse reasoning and sanity at that juncture of our
expedition crazy clyde was the one who didnt want to
go farther

  we crept on up the weedy path and then we found the
dog he was lying in a bed of wet violets and ill never
forget the sight of that pooch there was rover in the
moonlight we could see him clearly a pattern of polished
white bones a canine skeleton among the posies

  yes and someone had put a bullet through his skull
that hound hadnt bayed at the moon for many a year
and no one was going to tell me otherwise

  he had evaporated from his ribs the way someone on
the mudbank had evaporated from those trousers gel-
semium or no gelsemium that dog was no longer alive

  i aint a-goin further clyde burlap said

  i said no

  i aint a-goin further he repeated with a violent
headshake thats the colonels black dog if them
there bones can up an let out a howl then anything can
happen im gonna stay right here i got enough brains
for that

  okay i snapped therell be more lantern-light
left for miss johnwell and me we moved off

  he let out a yelp and caught up with us wait dont
leave me id sure die of fright ifn i see the ex-mayor
cornin at me in his birthday suit

  it wasnt a heartening picture ex-mayor or mortal i
hoped the man whod left his clothes under a hickory
limb would at least-if he did turn up-be modestly clad
in his underwear

  as we thefted along the path i kept a sharp eye out for
tracks but i didnt see any animal or man across the
river there were some jagged peals of thunder but the
sky overhead had cleared in patches and a green moon
sneaked out of a nest of black clouds and appeared as a
drowned face floating in a lake

  i couldnt help thinking of the dutchman and the farm-
hand the blacksmith the chinee and the goitrous profes-
sor who had supposedly crept up this path before and
ended up down by medwicks mill

  moonlight only exaggerated the blackness of under-
brush and trees twisting like a snake the foot trail
wound through the dripping boscage the rain had raised
a dank vapor and the soaked night steamed

  through the trees at the left we could see the river
sliding by like a great tide of coffee coasting along the
bank it tore at bushes slapped at the roots of willows and
made a sound like a vast gurgling in a cemetery

  if our progress along the path tells like a safari in the
jungle its because fifty yards of trail on that susquehanna
river island was like a trip across voodoo-haunted africa
only too soon the path came out of the bushes and we were
confronted by the house

standing in a flat clearing that fronted on the river
it looked as skeletal and abandoned as the meatless
dog and that empty suit of clothes nobody home

  i never saw a place that looked as run-down forgotten
and deserted once it might have been a mansion for
summer vacationing-back in the time of general grant

 now vines clambered up the sagging walls like weeds
 on the hull of a sunken steamship

 the verandas were littered with rubbish the palings
 had broken in shutters hung askew on windows broken
 in by vandal stones

 chimney bricks were scattered across the roof one
 third-story gable had caved in the architecture leaned
 tilted and tipped in decay and the silhouette in greenish-
 moon-gloom was black as coal it was a perfect abode
 for owls mice and bats

 is anything gloomier than a house deserted to rot on a
 river bank it took some resolution to approach that
 island mansion we had sneaked up at its back and i
 paused to scan the prospect hesitating to investigate
 the front

 go ahead edith shoved me are you scared

 whos scared

 you are -i am too but now that were this far lets
 look at the place lets see it through

 well look at it i growled nobodys lived there
 for a generation its all boarded up and gone to ruin
 what more is there to see

 burlap uttered a nervous nicker it was in front he
 blabbed a third-story window overlookin th river
 thats where i seen the colonels face

 come on mr burlap edith straightened her shoul-
 ders you show me

 who me

 yes

 i might see the face again

 thats exactly what im here for she tucked wet
 hair under her hat decisively and her chin had a deter-
 mined thrust

 stooping she picked up a crooked hickory stick and
 gripping it as a club stepped out into the clearing and
 strode at the house as if to give it a whipping

 come on

chapter vii

end of the line

 where do women get spunk at a time like that

  edith had it double of course she was likely to
 break down afterwards and have an old-fashioned cry but
 get her set on some job and she wasnt stopped

 she was as pretty as venus and as stubborn as a
 missouri mule

 i convoyed at her elbow with gun and lantern and we
 marched across the mud flat with burlap at heel like a
 gaunt jittery and bug-eyed beagle

 a near look at the house wasnt reassuring every-
 thing dripped and steamed rotting timber exuded a
 smell like dead wood in a marsh interior as glimpsed
 through broken shutters was dark as a mine

 rats scurried into hiding as we skirted a side porch
 some small creature jumped down the porch steps and
 scuffled off through the weeds and i wondered whether
 it was the dog wed heard i couldnt see any dog tracks
 around or any kind of tracks and i said so

 they dont leave tracks burlap moaned

 i snarled who doesnt

 ghosts and those as live past their four score years
 an ten thats why the police when they came out here
 to vestigate didnt find no footprints they dont leave


argosy

 tracks on this island especially those that float away

   i wondered if the owner of those clothes had floated
 away i rather hoped so a lot of things were floating
 away from the island right then bushes driftwood all
 the rubble which is collected by a rising tide i could tell
 the river was higher for water gleamed in the thickets
 where the underbrush was awash

   at the front of the house there was a stretch of open
 beach and as we rounded the veranda river water surged
 across the beach and turned it into a lake

   that scared me the river was far above its ordinary
 level six inches higher and it would sweep across the
 island

   i stared at the channel in alarm we had to get to
 high ground and get there quick

   then i saw at the end of the beach a mired rowboat
 i splashed out across the flooded spit of land edith and
 burlap after me i couldnt help a cry of disappointment

   it was a boat all right but there wasnt any bottom
 in it like the house and the skeleton dog it had been
 abandoned for many years

   weve got to do something i wailed at edith an-
 other half hour and this island will be under water bur-
 lap i pulled his arm we must find dry wood and
 make a fire weve got to signal

   he shook his dented head no use he mourned
wouldnt nobody see it aint no farmhouses long here
fer three miles on either side wouldnt nobody dast
come around this island neither

  youve got to help me i yanked him dont
gawp there weve got to find boards-nails-make a
raft dont you realize theres a flood

   his weak eyes filled with fright as if he hadnt no-
 ticed this imminent danger susquehanna can rise mighty
 fast once shes started cant remember when she was
 up this bad what with her an the colonel looks like
 ill never see my jessie again

 rphe colonel f with all that river in front of my face
  id forgotten i said colonel be damned which
 was something i should have said at nine oclock in the
 evening when edith had told me about him in the warmth
 and dry security of that binghamton hotel

   now i spoke too late

   edith said charlie

   i turned to see her rooted in two inches of beach-
 water rigid as statuary her profile fixed as marble star-
 ing at the old moon-gloomed house water was already
 creeping around the foundations lapping at the warped
 front veranda purling around the support posts of one
 rickety front wing that extended out over the river

   edith wasnt concerned with that her eyes were on
 an upper story window a third-floor window of that wing
 which was built out over the water

   she said in a flatted metallic undertone charlie there
 he is

   yes and whats more there he was i saw it and
friend burlap saw it too the face beyond the shutters
moonlight was focused on the window at that moment
and looking up we saw it clearly

   the shutters hung awry there and moonglow raying
 through the broken slats illuminated that impossible
 physiognomy

   if it wasnt a specter i never saw one somnambulistic
 pale it was some distance beyond the window sill as if

 levitated in the rooms inner darkness it hung there
 like an interior moon

   the features werent plain but it was a mans face
garnished with golden whiskers and a pompous crest
of hair black-robed shoulders supported this appari-
tional countenance and there winking and twinkling
and throwing out a handful of moonbeams from the
phantom chest was the diamond

   lord when a dogs howl wailed up in the night at that
moment i almost hopped out of my skin

   then the moon was drowned by a cloud and the lunar
light went out and the face was gone midnight plunged
around us with a thunder crash rain sluiced down a
shadow darted by me in the water-swirl

   charlie im going in

   edith was running for the house

t caught her with a flying tackle and we grappled
idiotically in the mud she wrenched to escape my
clutch

   charlie let me go you cant hold me back dont
you see what this means missing mayor turns up after
seventy years found recluse in island house keeps
alive on drugs to a hundred and ten what a headline-
what a newspaper story

   i panted keep your shirt on you cant go in alone
if someones in there-

   she struggled didnt you see the face didn you
see th diamond didnt you see

   i saw something i whispered stay close behind
me ill go in first

  courage not a bit of it i knew that  poli-
tician couldnt be there i was telling myself id been sub-
ject to a mass illusion an illusion made up of moonlight
and shadows imagination and the islands seance atmos-
phere

   the night and river and spook-lore had played on our
communal nerves spirit mediums and mesmerists know
the trick extrasensory impressionism get people con-
vinced theyre going to see something and the vision forms
on their retina

   yet i was certain id seen a diamond it had twinkled
like tiffanys window its funny how your mind can re-
ject part of a delusion but hold on to the part you like

   i didnt want to believe in the colonel i preferred to-
believe in his diamond i thought somebody had left
a cloak hanging on a hat-tree the face was an hallucina-
tion but the sparkler was real pinned to the cloak

   the truth is that diamond-shine had hit me in the
solar plexus and knocked the last vestige of intelligence
out of me i had a treasure-fever delirium of about three
hundred degrees 

   that i wanted the gem for edith was no defense i
went into that creaky old house and let edith come after
me crazy clyde had the brains of a sage in comparison

   i crept up on the veranda with the lantern and there
was one of those doors one of those vacant-house doors
that stand ajar on broken hinges giving view to a black
musty hallway within

  wow that house was musty the breath exuded by
that door was a halitosis of mould and damp-rot decom-
posing wood and stale plaster as if the house itself was
dead and full of decay-gas

   the river had been in that house and the wind and
the rain i let the lantern-light sneak in ahead of me
his honor is missing



and the inky recessed dampness all blit extinguished the
feeble glimmer

  the hall was carpeted with a slippery brown paste of
silt water leaked down bare walls from which the paper
had long since peeled the ceiling was covered with sweat-
beads that dripped the downpour was drumming into
the place

  edith pressing me from the rear i balked on that dank
threshhold listening to inner winds and a thousand minor
drips and dribblfes

  i advanced three steps and stopped the silt underfoot
felt like grease my lantern had discovered something
crouching along the sidewall it wasnt a hippopotamus
only an old rotted sofa the leather moss-backed with
mould the ruptured belly giving out viscera of horsehair
and springs

  exploring ahead the lantern gleams found a staircase
steps out of kilter bannister listing it toiled drunkenly
up to the green-black darkness of an upper balcony

  i started rubber-kneed for that flight of stairs then
i got a jolt

dobinson crusoe spying fridays footprint in the
sand didnt get one by half fridays foot wasnt
half as big there it was on the muddy carpet of the
hall-the print of a mans bare foot as plain as an impress
in plaster

  it was a big foot too a left foot the bare foot of
a man proportioned like a pachyderm

  and the right foot wasprinted ahead of it then the
left foot again then right left right left those bare-
foot prints went up the stairs

  i wasnt going to scare edith but she spied it

  she breathed charlie its he

  it was like her to have her pronouns correct at such
a time behind her crazy clyde let out a gasp and
when i spun at the sound surprised to find him in the
van he was bent at the middle hands clutching his
stomach as if it had turned into a green apple staring
at the footprints with jack-o-lantern eyes

  im sick he moaned its him he was out there
a-swimmin in th river an when he seen us cornin he
left his clothes an run back here to th house hes
upstairs right now-an ive swallered my cud

  the great pinkerton couldnt have regurgitated a more
sensible theory there was something in common between
those size twelve footprints and the size twelve endicott-
johnsons wed found

  but i wouldnt accept the deduction i was too
diamond-conscious right then i snarled low those
prints mightve been left here a week ago you two stay
down here with the lantern

  i fumbled out my cigarette lighter im going up-
stairs

  you and i both edith whispered this is my
story and im sticking to it

  burlap refused to be left behind with his thoughts so
we all went up the stairs the footprints crossed the
balcony and pattered up another flight of stairs we fol-
lowed on tiptoe bunched together creeping like mice i
pretended nobody couldve heard us

  the rain was beating down a steady roar and around us
the walls gurgled like a thousand leaking plumbing pipes
but the stair-steps creaked and cried out as if we were
treading on somebodys toes

  burlaps clodhoppers thumped edith rattled her stick
against the bannister i know i was breathing like an
accordion

tm sure an owl-hoot would have sent us tumbling

  down two flights aheap but somehow we reached the
third floor the journey hardened my nerves i was
positive the tracks were weeks old

  new or old they couldnt belong to any ex-mayor of
binghamton fabulously vigorous at the age of one hun-
dred and ten no ghosts as burlap had declared didnt
leave tracks on this or any island

  these prints had been made by some prowler who had
visited the house like us they padded down a long third-
floor corridor turned left with the corridor and proceeded
out into the front wing

  this quarter of the house was dry the flooring was
warped and bulgy the plaster cracking but we ran into
dust and cobwebs gangrene hadnt infected the wood-
work

  i remember thinking that this wing was newer than the
rest of the house the roof was sound probably a built-on
addition

  not that the architecture was modern or that i gave it
much study but the atmosphere had stuffied to that of a
long-closed attic the footprints smudged down the
hall entered a wide empty room i sent the lanternlight
in after them then craning in over the threshhold saw
nobody there

  edith peeped over my one shoulder burlap peeped
over the other stalled in the doorway we all peered

  edith whispered theyre gone

  she meant the tracks but there was no place for them
to go i flicked lantern light to the corners of the room
empty bare floor walls and ceiling one window com-
pletely boarded up from the inside one door-the door
where we stood

  the foot prints went on into the room circled the
dusty floor as if uncertain about where to go tracks
likethe people who make them have to go somewhere

  but these tracks were different they walked around
on the warp-tilted floor then they sidled along the right-
hand wall then they stopped they didnt go on and
they didnt come back

  end of the line

  not quite there was one thing left my hair roots
froze as the lantern light found it at the end of the track
lying on the floor a dirty undershirt wet and smeared

  as if the man who wore it had come to that final wall
and melted to a bvd

chapter viii

monster of the flood

tt was worse than a suit worse than white dog-bones

  worse than that abandoned corn patch with its secret
jasmine bush worse than that moon-conjured face that
lonely shimmy shirt

  i picked it up between two fingers and looked under
it as if to see a tiny human form melting off into the
floor -cracks

  nothing just the floor not even a hole where a
mouse couldve scurried under the base-board

burlap uttered a gruesome croak i told you they


argosy

dont leave tracks on this island spirits goes around in
the air an men who lives past a hundred walk light-foot
my pa was a grave-digger an he told me the dead
dont leave no tracks-especially those what float away

  the scotch have a word for it cauld grue thats
what i experienced then a wind down my collar right out
of an ice box

  crazy clyde went on croaking about the colonels ghost
and drowned corpses swimming under water down at
medwicks mill and confronted by that footprint phe-
nomenon i was ready to believe the saga of the five
drowned diamond-hunters and prepared to abandon the
search

  i dropped that empty undershirt and it hit on the floor
with a wet slap my treasure-fever turned into a chill

  edith whispered the wall

  i looked at her my teeth clicking huh

  snatching the lantern from me she held it up i stared
at the wall i couldnt see anything but blank plaster
and shadow-patterns	

  see there edith gasped that big spider web it
stretches from the ceiling to the base-board its just
been torn the spider hasnt had time to rebuild the
thing

  i didnt register i thought she was scared by the
spider-a big black river spider which came scaling down
the wall like an ink-splash on the end of a silver thread

  whacking out with my gun-butt i smashed the beast
thump the blow made a dull sound blotting the spider
on the wall plaster

  why its hollow i gasped a hollow wall

  yes theres an opening here and somebodys gone
through thats what tore the spider web edith point-
ed an excited finger thats where the man who left
that gym shirt mustve gone

  i was knocking on the wall with the gun trying to
knock softly edith was holding up the lantern cracks
were zigzagged all over the wall like frontiers in a map
of europe and when one vertical crack suddenly widened
it was like a minor earthquake

  a sudden mechanical grinding sound came from the
plaster like the gears of a grandfather clock getting ready
to strike my thumps must have touched off some se-
creted mechanism

  the plaster moved white dust smoked before my
eyes hidden hinges squealed and a section of the wall
swung inward and i was staring dumbstruck into a secret
attic chamber

i wont soon forget that snug little hide-away it was
the sort of top-floor room where your great-aunt might
store some heirloom furniture and her wedding dress to
keep it from the moths

  the walls were paneled with cedar the air was stale but
dry in the window at the left the outside shutters were
broken but the glass was intact keeping out the rain

  the room was bare of furniture there were no foot
tracks on the floor

  but there was a man in that room a great barrel-
sized imposing figure-large as life and twice as handsome
-dominating the back wall he was seated in a chair
like a king on his throne facing us with our lantern in
the door

  his eyes stared at us unwinking in the lantern shine
his smile was imperious and commanding

  his personality filled the room in his judicial robes he
looked as important as henry viii golden hair and
whiskers framed his face like an aura around the sun on
his bosom the diamond glimmered like a star

  and wonderfully impossibly as if held aloft by inflated
ego he seemed to be levitated chair and all in the air
his honor the mayor

  ediths voice was hollowed in awe

  i dont wonder clyde burlap fell to his knees in a
sort of salaam the trick of shadows and lantern shine
and unexpectedness and eye-magination gave that figure
on the back wall a reality that stopped my heart

  it was a wonderful likeness remarkable it took me
a minute that seemed a year to see it was a picture

  get up edith yanked on burlaps collar its only
a painting its that portrait the colonel had made of him-
self my charlie isnt it amazing

t couldnt answer it was that amazing i suppose an
art critic would have called it a rotten portrait the
flesh tones were too pink the beard too dandelion-yellow
the features too pompously glorified

  but id like to know the artist who did that thing im
sure he kidded his subject and his subject didnt know it

  he had painted an election poster but in so doing he
had brought out the bombast und politician character the
back-slapper and skullduggerer the florid beefy boss-
tweedy genial impostor of our grants administration
period

  it was more than a canvas painted by brush and oils
it was a masterpiece for the american museum framed
on the wall it was so lifelike i half expected the painted
figure to stand up and demand to know what we were
doing there	

  so thats what we saw in the window edith moved
past me looking up from the ground below with the
moonlight through the shutters and the picture hanging
at that angle-thats what we saw

  she raised the lantern higher sparks showered from
the diamond on the portraits bosom i caught her arm
edith

  burlap stepping on my heels asked with surprising
sense even if its only a pitcher whats it doin here
an that diamond aint painted-

  i whispered no ten feet from the picture i
halted again to stare the gem winked blinkered and
shone brightening in the nearer lantern light i whis-
pered my lord its real a real diamond edith its
enormous pinned to the picture 

  i know i took two steps toward that bonanza that
blazing gem had me magnetized then a lot of things
happened at once crazy clydes observation sank in and
i stalled to gasp how did that painting come here

  our dim-witted guide made the brightest remark q the
evening a picture cant take off its undershirt an leave
foottracks 

  edith cried out were moving charlie charlie the
house is moving 

  there was a rumbling under the floor the room tilt-
ed lurched lightning blazed at the window and for-
getting everything else i rushed to look out

  four terrific flashes exploded in the sky and looking
down through the rain-blur i saw a swirling tide of water
the house was adrift we were going down the river

  then there was a fifth explosion it came from the
his honor is missing



door-the secret door of that attic chamber a stunning
gun-shot wham it smashed the lantern in ediths
hand she screamed

  the room went black as pitch but there was some-
one standing in that door a figure blacker than the
blackness

  i knew it had a pistol in its hand and then it spoke
to us in a deep basso monotone

  i can see you in the dark you three hands up keep
them up so im only a picture am i thieves tres-
passers ill show you what happens to those who try
to steal my stone

  lightning flared again at the window and in the blue
witch-shine the speaker was revealed his bulk filled the
door frame in terrible menace his revolver looked bigger
than a cannon

  he was robed in midnight black and he peered at us
with eyes that gleamed topaz under a thicket of tangled
yellow hair and his left hand petted a beard that looked
like golden sea-weed

  the colonel burlap wailed

  this time it wasnt a painting

it laughed as the lightning went out a laugh that
rang through the swimming darkness of that house
like iron blows on an anvil

  so you thought you could make off with it did you
you came here to snaffle my gem as if the ungrateful
voters in binghamton didnt take enough away from me
the scheming insurance adjustors the rascals in city hall

  didnt they get my mansion my real estate holdings
my stocks and bonds my private property didnt they
get enough

  booming like a low-keyed pipe organ the voice rumbled
through outer tympani of thunder and the snare-drum-
ming of rain

  the room tipped and tilted rocking uncertainly and i
was seasick deathly seasick i could hear ediths
breath sobbing burlap gulping like a cow he moaned
please mister mayor-

  dont appeal to me came the booming answer and
stand where you are keep your hands high i can see
you dont appeal to me clyde burlap and dont move
or ill put a bullet through you

  burlap wailed oh my glory he knows my name

  again that anvil-clang laugh sure i know you
didnt i get your father a job as municipal grave-digger
didnt i give him charge of the potters field then he
went and told on me

  sure that the substitute corpse grew red hair in-
stead of like mine thats gratitude wasnt it but
what can the mayor of a city expect

  election day they all climb on the band wagon every
office-seeker and citizen is his friend let anything go
wrong though they forget they elected him call him a
politician a ward-heeler a grafter

outside there was a deafening thunder burst blue
lightning sheeted through the window we had an-
other flittergibbet glimpse of that yellow-bearded boom-
voiced visitation

  the eyes glittered and the aimed revolver meant busi-
ness i stood shatterpated arms lifted numb unable
to breathe

  the flooring sank rose and settled as downstairs there

was a rending of timber as if a section of the house were
breaking away

  so you couldnt leave me alone anger harsh-
ened the iron laugh you couldnt leave me with my last
few belongings to live out here in peace

  first it was old man dinkloofer-i aint forgot even if
it was forty years ago-sneakin out here to get his
greedy dutch hands on my diamond

  then it was that yokel gawzberry-as if a rube like
that could take anything from me

  the blacksmith made more trouble-i aint as mus-
cular as when i used to swim through the susquehanna
ice-and the chinaman was more clever-he wanted my
secret drug as well as my diamond-but i got him too

  as for strool last year with that vegetable on his
neck-but that thing was drowning him anyhow and
i only saved it the trouble

  i dont know where edith got the nerve to speak out
my own throat couldnt utter a sound she said in a
strained voice you confess to murdering them then
you confess to drowning those five

  make another big headline for your newspapers
wouldnt it was the harsh answer as if the newspa-
pers havent already made me enough trouble but all
right lady i confess thats all the good itll do you

  the threat was unmistakable i was planning to at-
tack him anyway and the floor helped me to get started

  there was a lurch as if the house were going over a
tidal wave the flooring tipped up violently throwing me
headlong at the door the enemy was also rocked off bal-
ance and i collided into him a-cropper

  luckily i caught the wrist of his gun-hand with un-
intentional jiu jitsu twisted the weapon out of his clutch

  i heard the revolver drop remembered that i held an
empty horse pistol brought the barrel whanging down
on my adversarys invisible head

  i mustve stunned him momentarily for he gave a
kind of sigh and relaxed like a sack of meat in my arms
i got an asphyxiating breath of whisky that staggered me
more than his weight

  but the armistice was only momentary he revived
with a squall came over on top of me as the floor tilted
back wrapped his arms around me in the dark and
squeezed like a grizzly bear

  id like to forget that awful scrimmage then try to
imagine a wrestling match with a hundred-and-ten-year-
old politician flimflammer absconderer and clapperclaw
two hundred and fifty pounds of flesh vitalized by gel-
semium-

  a monster like that in a house adrift on a flooded river
lord

chapter ix

medwicks mill

tte hugged i pounded we waltzed electrical
flashes lit the scene the room swayed with the
house as we danced

  edith huddled by the window her elbows over her head
crazy clyde stood in a corner playing blub-blub-blub on
his lowerjip with a finger

the painting of his honor the mayor looked on

  the fleshly rejuvenation of his honor the mayor was
crushing me in his clasp as if i were a bushel basket


argosy

whirling me in suffocating embrace breathing in my face
like a distillery bawling you cant have the diamond 
its mine its mine

  i pounded on his head with the horse pistol and the
blows made the sickening sound of hammer-taps on a
muskmelon i couldnt knock him out in my despera-
tion i saw myself being squeezed to a jelly

  how could i knock out an athlete who survived icy
rivers sported hatless in blizzards wrestled like the
terrible turk at the ripe old age of a century

  we waltzed out into the attic where the footprints had
ended in a gym shirt fell on the tilting floor rolled
acrobatted to our feet went around the attic locked to-
gether in a sort of wild jitterbug swirl

  cloth tore as the creatures black coak wrapped around
me every time i hit him he grunted and tightened the
squeeze

  i could feel my ribs beginning to stave my lungs
were collapsing i couldnt gasp

  with my free left hand i clutched a meaty throat i
might as well have tried to throttle a water buffalo

  the fight carried back into the secret chamber where
the portrait watched its painted eyes seeming to follow
us in the lightning flares

  edith got into it whaling at my assailant with her
hickory stick the stick broke apart like punk and the
splinters got in my mouth tasting like a chewed pencil

  crazy clyde somehow got mixed in and the four of us
in the middle of the floor went merry-go-round

rphe house lurched throwing us to the floor in a strug-
 gling heap me on the bottom that squeeze was
killing me in the blackness and jumping storm-light the
play of glares and shadows there seemed to be two mayors
one who mashed me in murderous rough-house the other
imperious arrogantly posed in his robes with his princely
diamond watching himself in gladiatorial combat from a
box seat

  i could hear edith screaming and burlap caterwauling
and the monster on top of me bellowing like a bull he
was banging my head on the cedar floorboards and sky-
rockets were lighting my brain

  i tried to shout edith edith get away she
must have been hitting him with the broken lantern
for there was a shower of kerosene oil

  in this nightmare i had the impression of my left
hand in my assailants beard pulling hair out by the
roots he squalled get away she cant get out of
the house its sinking in the river damn you ive got
you trapped

  iron smashed me under the chin as suddenly his grip
let go i knew hed recovered his pistol

  i wasnt out cold just cold enough to have to lie there
as he flounced to his feet gorilla-savage with his gun
back he roared at edith back into that corner by
the window up with the hands one move and this
time ill blow your pretty head off

  in a flame-dance of lightning he towered like a
wrecked dracula his cape was torn loose exposing a
fat hairy shoulder his face was terrible

  crimson rivulets leaked down his cheeks from red
patches of bald scalp where my blows had removsd patches
of hair from one side of his jaw the blond beard had
been tom mouth and chin were a scarlet smear

  he steadied as the flooring tipped sweeping the room

 with his gun in that snicker-snack of lightning he no
 longer resembled the glorified picture

 edith retreated arms lifted eyes terrified moving in
 automatic obedience

 he stepped at burlap dealt him a kick that flung
 him helterskelter into the corner with the girl stand
 there with her you dunce lift those hands and keep
 them lifted or ill blast another dent in your brain you
 too  he roared down at me into that corner there

 i couldnt stir i could only look up at him in dreary
 apprehension stunned nerves held me spread-eagled

 he walked to me stepped on my wrist kicked the use-
 less horse pistol out of my right hand booted me across 
 the floor into the window-corner

 stand up

 grasping the windowsill i pulled myself upright

 lift the mitts

 somehow i forced up my hands

 hphere was a minute while the room was black and
 the floor undulated silence filled with the crying of
 wind water-rush drumming rain the house shook and
 rumbled

 in this midnight the diamond in the portrait on the
 backwall gave off a faint shine i could see our assailants
 silhouette blacker than the chambered blackness posed
 in midfloor

 apparently he was making up his mind

 he snarled id like to riddle you-the three of you
 but theyd find the bullets in your bodies the old way
 is better by judas im going to let you drown

 i tried to tell him he couldnt do that-couldnt drown
 edith-but my tongue was stunned i couldnt utter a
 sound

 im going to let you drown the voice came baleful
 im going to drown you like i drowned the others-the
 old dutchman and gawzberry big ben and ching and
 professor strool

 an electrical flare lit his face and he roared a laugh

 the house is going theyll think it was the flood
 well be at the rapids soon and the house will break up
 into kindling you cant get out of this room when i
 go out im going to smash the mechanism of that door
 so it locks you in

 but just to make sure im going to bash each one
 of you on the head before i go and knock you cold
 theyll think you was bashed when the house went down
 so you wont know it when you drown   

 he was mad stark bestial something in his grinding
 snarl told me he was going to do it and the knowledge
 paralyzed my will edith beside me stood rigid as stone

 nothing we could do in the face of that revolver that
 death sentence held us like a spell

 but first-our executioner drew out the sentence to
 its last drop of sadistic enjoyment- first im going to
 have my property

 i think ill leave the picture with you-to watch you
 drown but not the diamond im taking that with me
 now my house is gone i may need spending money

 thirty thousand dollars oh ho i want you to see im
 taking my diamond with me

 tte was moving backward toward the painting chuck-
 ling in contemplation of our terror lightning
 flashed blue into the room he shouted dont move
his honor is missing



  stepping back against the canvas he made an avid up-
ward grab

  his hand never touched the blazing sparkler those
greedy fingers-ill never forget them if i live to be a
million they reached up-not high enough

  they closed on a handful of air then they clawed on
the canvas portrait and for a split second seemed to cling
as if the grabber fallen to his knees were clutching the
portraits painted robes

  it was over in that space of a lightning-flicker the mans
blood-curdling shriek his fingers clawing down the pic-
ture his body going through the floor

  before our eyes in a flash he had melted away two hun-
dred and fifty pounds of flesh in vanishment there was
a great gust of wind a smell of the river the floor opened
under him and he wasnt there

  he had dropped away

  only his scream remained trailing up from somewhere
far below i broke from shock with the others we
jumped toward the picture

  i screamed edith be careful on her knees she was
feeling the floorboards ahead of her she found the trans-
verse floor-cracks and opened the trap door

  and that was the last horror that square of hinged
flooring directly under the picture swinging downward and
revealing that slippery-walled shaft which went three
floors down to the river like a laundry chute

  there was some laundry down there too

  water roared and boiled and a gust of river-breath hit
us in the face as we peered down and there was a dread-
ful gargling screech

  lightning lit up the whirlpool under the shaft and we
saw the white face looking up a bald-headed face pudgy
and popeyed washed clean of its yellow beard and hair

  in that final glimpse all of us had a flash of recog-
nition

  edith screamed down youre not the colonel

  i yelled the fat man from the hotel

  burlap wailed hans dinkloofer

  the mans answer was to scream his own death sen-
tence im tangled in the cloak i cant swiiiim

  brown water closed over the face and it was gone edith
let the trap swing back into place with a slam crazy
clyde scared sane cried golden jerusalem lets get out
of here

we got out of there out of that trick-box room and
out of the attic and four at a time down the stairs

  we got out of the house the lower hall was three feet
deep in water and we got out on the gold leather sofa
which was floating around like a hippopotamus

  i can see us yet as we paddled that monstrosity across
the billows of that thundering flood edith sat on the
head while i furnished the propeller

  i didnt mind burlap squatting amidships and dabbling
the water with his fingers crying toot toot im cap-
tain i was almost loony with fear myself

  what i minded was the river sweeping us into the eddy
at medwicks mill we might have landed in a happier
spot come to think of five others who had drifted to port
there

  the old house went on down as we clambered up on
the wall of the flooded millrace we saw it swirling outward
in a deeper channel i found myself clutching a tuft of
corn-silk in my wet hand and i wondered how it got there

little things can bother you at a time like that it felt like
a handful of beard-hair

  then i was bothered by something bigger the house
turned around in midriver heeled in an undercurrent and
came circling close to the mill

  thunderbolts darting around the sky gave us a glimpse
of that upper window that ghostly pomp-whiskered face
beyond the shutters like a spirit materialization and the
beckoning twinkle of that diamond

  only once after that i looked back-not until we had
reached hilltop above the flooded valley the house
snagged in the rapids was breaking up

chapter x

cream of the jest

a nd thats the story of the mayor of a city who com-
mitted suicide and then after he was buried and the
grave-diggers went home the insurance companies said
it wasnt the mayor at all that some stooge had been
buried in the mayors place

  and the question then naturally was where was the
mayor whose funeral was it

  was it kidnaping-a traction scandal-politics-an in-
surance gag-a case of cherchez la femme did the foul
hand of murder clutch shadowy fingers around city hall

  folks are still asking those questions about this famous
case and if you want to know the answers you must look
for them as edith johnwell did in binghamton n y

  maybe you can find out more about him than edith did
maybe your research wont be washed out by a flood or
maybe seeking the answer to one mystery youll run into
another-find the impostor impersonated by an impostor

  they never found the fat mans body they never
found the picture or the diamond the up-state floods
were pretty bad that year if you remember besides wip-
ing that island clean of that haunted house the susquehan-
na wiped out some riverfront sections of binghamton

  the police busy with the flood relief thought edith
and i mustve been attacked by some chance vagrant
they didnt believe poor burlaps insistence that old man
dinkloofers son hans had come back after many years
absence

  they reminded crazy clyde that he was crazy

  but i remembered the hotel bellhop paging a mr
dinglehoofer the name wasnt registered at the hotel
and the boy couldnt remember but next day there wasnt
any fat man in evidence around the lobby

  so i think what happened was this that man i took
for a hotel dick was old man dinkloofers prodigal son
returned to his home town after a circus career i won-
dered if hed been a clown hed overheard edith telling
me the biography of the vanished ex-mayor

  from his fathers ill-fated involvement he knew the
local legend perhaps hed never given it much credence

  or perhaps in need of funds hed returned after years
on the road to investigate the matter

  hearing edith polishing off the old diamond story-
finding it still fresh and bright-hed beat our time out
to the island to get there first

  maybe he raced down the right bank of the river while
we toiled with jessie down the left i think he swam out
to the island carrying his clothes in a bundle and landed
just aiiead of us


argosy

  he saw our rowboat making for the mud bank and he
didnt have time to get dressed so as not to leave tracks
he waded around the islands fringe the rain wiped out
his tracks up the mud-bank and invisible in the night
he let out those dog-howls to scare us

  barefoot in his underwear he sneaked into the haunted
house up to the attic

  he must have known about the secret room from his
father or suspected its location from a glimpse of the
portrait in that upper window or maybe he found it by
accident pausing to lean against that bare wall

  at any rate he opened the hidden door meantime he
heard us entering the house we were probably close on
his heels he wiped his wet feet on his gym shirt to avoid
leaving any more footprints and ducked into the secret-
chamber

tfhat puzzles me is how he got out perhaps he
 squeezed through the window shut it after him and
climbed down a drain pipe to the ground-a difficult feat
for a man of such corpulence

  in which case-unless he failed to spy it in the dark-he
wouldve tried to grab the diamond first

  im inclined to believe he opened the trick door looked
in heard us coming up the stairs closed the panel and
skedaddled into another quarter of the wing his dried
feet careful not to leave tracks

  concealed from sight he heard us blunder into the
hidden room

  he didnt dare to shoot us although hed brought a re-
volver he was wild to get his fingers on that diamond
doubtless his first intent was to scare us galley west so
he put on that colonel stunt coming into the secret door-
way behind us

  where did he get the black cloak maybe he found it
there in the attic an old drapery or a black velvet curtain
from one of the forgotten bedrooms would have served

  the villainous role was easy under the circumstances es-
pecially to one who had been a showman that gem-lust-
ing cagliostro knew how to stage an act when there was a
thirty-thousand-dollar bauble at stake

   the false beard of course was corn silk

  but that twinkling sparkler was his undoing as it
wouldve been mine

  i dont mean that the lure of that fabulous stone would
have driven me to murder but certainly i would have
fallen victim to that devils trap as he had yes he saved
me from that

  he didnt know about the trap door and the laundry
chute to the river he knew they had gone there but he
didnt know the exit by which old man dinkloofer and
jed gawzberry big ben and ching the chinaman and
professor strool had left the house for the mourgish wa-
ters of medwicks mill

  i felt sorry for those five when i saw the trap but that
greedy fat man got his just deserts he wouldve mur-
dered us in cold blood for that stone it looked as big as
the kohinoor and the twinkle more than my hammer-
taps drove him mad

  edith doesnt like this explanation but then she isnt
writing this story she refused to write it she gave up
the newspaper profession and the series about vanished
men she says shes willing to leave them to the missing
persons bureau and a wifes place is in the home

the

 out while ive put this down shes done a lot of kibitz-
 ing her idea is that the bogeyman who attacked us
 was really the colonel

   she believes that he kept himself alive in that island
 hide-out with his insidious jasmine drug that he lived as
 a recluse in that secret room nourishing himself on gel-
 semium and preening-himself before his portrait polish-
 ing his diamond and waiting for visitors to victimize as a
 spider waits for flies

   he kept his whiskers shaved perhaps to avoid possible
 detection but he loved them so much he preserved them
 in a box

   then it hurt his ego when we said he was only a picture
 so he pinned on his glorious beard to show us what he
 looked like i think thats pretty far fetched and it
 doesnt account for that handful of corn silk but edith
 sees it that way

   she thinks the colonel was a charlatan points to the
 fact that his best friend was a man named hull and that
 a man named hull became famous around binghamton
 at the time exploiting a fake fossilized mummy known as
 the cardiff giant

   birds of a feather flocking together says edith edith
 doesnt like the colonel

   somehow i do going over his record ive come to
 enjoy the ingenious fellow lots of us today are on the
 verge of bankruptcy-rather a national institution as a
 politician he was the product of his time and his time
 produced some pretty slick politicians

   the whiskers the portrait in oils the diamond which
 ive come to believe was probably paste were common
 to the bigwigs of the era but the colonels ingenuity was
 uncommon

   the defection was never proved-the insurance com-
 panies canceled payment on misstatements in the appli-
 cations-but im inclined to believe the colonel abetted
 by friend hull rigged up a bogus suicide and rung in a
 counterfeit corpse

   then i like to picture the colonel scuttling off to his
 secluded river island installing himself with his beard his
 portrait and his diamond in the abandoned house

   i like to picture him living there in jolly solitude while
 the local hawkshaws ran about in bafflement and conster-
 nation addled the rocking-chair brigade

   i can imagine friend hull dressing up as a woman in
 black and rowing out to the island with the latest reports
 i can fancy the two boys doubling with laughter at the
 gossip of the colonels appearance in mexico

   i can see too- how a man of the colonels risibilities
 might have been offended at some of the talk especially the
 self-righteous indignation of investors who had gambled
 with him and lost

   back-biters fair-weather friends hull i want you
 to start a whisper that ive left my diamond out here
 before i do pull out for foreign parts ill show them

   pure speculation of course because theres no record
 the colonel did have a portrait or a diamond but i like
 to imagine him hanging up that picture baiting the lure

   constructing that man-trap-as a moral lesson to the
 greedy if you will-down on his knees on the floor of that
 upper room boring with a big auger

                                  i bore with a big auger

                                                   colonel dwight

              a short
              short story

  by paul ernst

      author of he didnt want soup etc

 zabe wilcox spat at a caterpillar scratched a
 lean hip under patched overalls and slouched
 against the clapboard wall of the store

 i	fella was going great guns all right zabe didnt know
 much about him except his name was berger and he did
 something political down to jerrystown

     is a great and glorious country boomed the man
 at the steps every one has an equal chance under the
 goverment of the people by the people and for the

   zabe chewed his cud of plug and listened without much
 interest two three people were behind berger in the
 store doorway zabe was alone at the far end of the porch
 beside some rolls of sheep wire

   the rest-maybe thirty forty folks-were on the side-
 walk and in the street

   zabe saw mccarran who had lost last nights drunk in
 the end row of this mornings potato field and little ned
 armbruster with a wife and two kids living around in his
  sedan and with his eyes all shiny and sweat coming
 from under his hat brim	

   he saw andy with the crooked leg and jake with the
 rash that come of handling potatoes and big art smith

       live in a glorious democracy friends berger
 wiped the back of his fleshy neck and put the handker-
 chief away without much interrupting the way his arms
 waved

   equal for all equal chance to go where you want to
 and work when you want to thats democracy anybody
 that sneaks around and tries to tell you different is a hired
 agitator and shouldnt be allowed to stay in our great
 land   

    zabe spat tobacco juice at the caterpillar again not mueji
 interested hed seen berger get out of the car of young
 don mennis of mennis farms inc yesterday evening

   and he had seen berger and some of the boys drinking
 last night and the boys had sure felt it under the sun
 along the potato rows today but zabe had felt little inter-
 est in any of it he had picked a lot of stuff in a lot of
 places and heard a lot of guys

   the caterpillar caught in a mess that was none of its
 making humped to get out of it

   bunch of dirty traitors friends and i say let em
go where there aint democracy if i had my way all such
trouble-makers would have to read the constitution every
morning and sing the star spangled banner every night
standin on their heads

abe toyed idly with the idea of singing a song while
standing on your head then he saw andy edging
toward the fringe of the crowd moving slow on his twisted
leg

  last night andy had moved a whole lot faster when the
mennis farms boss strolled past just after zabe had re-
marked stolidly that eighteen cents was a hell of an hours
pay gosh sake zabe-suppose he heard you

      any true patriot    thank god for democracy
and fight for it    get down on his knees-on his knees
friends-and kiss the flag under whose glorious shadow he
lives i for one would be proud to so salute my countrys
flag here and now in the sight of all  

  it looked to zabe as if this berger had an eye on andy
too kind of sideways but he couldnt be sure and andy
was close to the edge of the crowd now

  zabe turned his head back and berger now had a flag
either somebodyd handed to him or he had taken from
his pocket he was whipping it around and then he laid it
on the floor of the porch

    in the sight of all friends thats the way im
made  

  zabes jaws moved slower for a minute with mild sur-
prise because he hadnt been listening to berger close
enough to be quite prepared for the next move

  it kind of takes you back suddenly to see a guy on all
fours nuzzling on the ground with the back of his neck
lobster red and his southern exposure pointing off toward
the skyline and you feel sort of uncomfortable for such a
guy-

  thats what anybody but a dirty hunyak would be
glad to do declared berger im sure all here would be
glad and proud to do the same you now he pointed a
stubby forefinger at fat jim barsen who ran the movie
house down the street




argosy

   kiss the flag kiss the flag shrilled ned armbruster
 eyes shining sweat on his cheeks and barsen puffed to
 the steps and up them to put his face down with a set
 smile like he was rooting for something in the folds of cloth
 on the dirty floor

   andy was three paces beyond the edge of the crowd
 now slow on his bum leg trying to look as if he wasnt go-
 ing any place in particular and bergers gaze was square
 on him

   you he called out i bet you know how to treat
 your countrys flag

   andy stood favoring his crooked leg trying to look
 every which way at once and his tongue went over his lips

   come on come on roared big art so andy came back
 slowly and knelt having kind of a time of it with his leg
 and he put his face down

   zabe voided the cud of tobacco and took out the plug
 curved with his hip for another cud

   and you friend said berger

 abe bit into the tobacco and looked idly at the crowd
 and saw that suddenly everybody was looking at him
 and it seemed that berger was looking at him too with a
 special kind of look

  who me gaped zabe

   go on zabe yelled mccarran and little ned
shrilled kiss it kiss it

   come here you berger said

 zabe hesitated in slow perplexity then slouched toward
 the man from jerrystown lank and tall in his faded over-
 alls with a sun-lined face disfigured by a mole on the
 right cheek next to one of the deeper creases

   i guess said berger itd be a good idea for you to
 show if youre a patriot

   i expect im one said zabe worrying it out aint
 thought about it much

   show us challenged berger and the guys on the
sidewalk yelled with each one trying to yell louder than
his neighbor and looking sideways at his neighbor and
then there was silence as zabes lank body didnt bend

   well said berger

   and zabe said slowly nope worrying it out his mind
 while his jaws mechanically mangled the cud

   well friends said berger i guess we know now
 whos patriotic around here i guess we know how much
 attention to pay to anything a man like this has to say
 do we let him get away with it

 doit go on do it screamed little ned and zabes
 forehead wrinkled while he tried to work it out straight in
 his head and he said nope i dont aim to kiss nothin
 im yelled out in public to kiss

co bergers fist got him from the side and the store
 steps were waves of men crowding up and zabes arm
flailed and his lean body humped as he tried to get out of
the mass

  but he couldnt they beat him down and very soon the
blackness was closing in

  his lips touched the flag though he didnt know that or
anything else by then and a couple of minutes or a couple
of hours later he opened his eyes and he was in his topless
roadster and the note beside him said

get out of here ij you know whats good for you

  so he got out but only out of the car and there was a
good strong lock on the back of the roadster with a suit-
case inside that held all he owned

  the gun was in the bottom of the suitcase it looked
like something from a museum because it was one of the
first colts huge and brown-shiny carried by zabes
grandpap when he went west to help open up the country
after being dismissed from grants army

  but the old gurr didnt look funny in zabes fist with
 slugs nosing out the cylinder and it wasnt going to
look funny to ned armbruster and art smith and mccar-
ran and berger and a couple of others when zabe wilcox
gave em a gander at the lumps on his head and then
shoved the muzzle at their breadpans

tut after a while zabe let the gun hang loose in his
- hand because hell ned had a wife and kids and
hed known big art and mccarran for a long time and
besides he still wasnt clear and steady in his head he was
worried

  he had been troubled unsure when the light went out
for him when he was refusing to do what the crowd yelled
to him to do because there hadnt seemed any real reason
not to except he felt crawly inside

  worried uncertain zabe felt further in the suitcase and
got out his own flag it was frazzled and only had thirteen
stars in it which didnt seem right

  and yet he had been offered a mite of money for it
once because lit seemed there werent many of them and
some early wilcox had carried it a long time ago

  zabe unsure worried looked carefully around to see if
anybody was in sight because you dont want to make a
damned fool of yourself do you

  and then he ducked his head in the roadsters back so if
and one should see him theyd think he was just hunting a
wrench or something and after that he wrapped the old
colt reluctantly in the old flag and put them both away
and stolidly cranked up his car

to start rattling triangles skeletons only thus willhe
be able to probe the murder of
matt mchale the owner of the rocker-m ranch who
was shot down and robbed a year before since his
death the rocker-m herd has been severely raided by
rustlers and nesters have overrun the range taking
advantage of the new homestead law the inheritance of
mary ellen mchale the dead ranchers daughter has
dwindled almost to nothing deserted by her fiance the
smooth young lawyer martin burdette mary has taken
refuge in the home of one of her few remaining friends
dr george farabaugh she is a companion for the doc-
tors wife ada a crippled and embittered woman

vld bearpaw a grizzled veteran of the rocker-m is
 loyal to mary ellen mchale and he has done his
best to protect her but threatening notes have warned
the girl that she is in danger and on one occasion it is
only the fast thinking and faster action of cass gentry
that saves her from an assassins bullet

  ollie shand cattle-thief is the man most generally
suspected of matt mchales murder for mchale and his
men strung up shands rustler father yet it is ollie

 recognized him to be

 the snaketrack herd has mainly escaped the depreda-
 tions of the rustlers gentry is suspicious of its tough

  it was found in the foxfire wash cass charged it

band youre wearin now childress where did you ride
last night

  buck was with me the woman shrilled he was
at our shack-

  shet yer lip childress snarled ill deal with this
ill hand im whut hes come fer

  he had a gophers pout-lipped look but there was
more than a gophers fight in him the childress boys
were from mountain stock and they rated tough in any
company bucks high-voiced drawl had rage behind it
and his big-boned hands gripped the edge of the bar
with a pressure that squeezed them pallid

  hits plain what yer a-doin gentry he said y
aint changed yer trade er yer ways raisin hell an
crowdin trouble-thats whut hes paid fer gents houn-
din folks an spyin an bounty-huntin an murder is all
a days work

bery and murder ten witnesses can testify it was an
even draw and that tom took his bullet in the teeth

  i got tuh stand an swaller hit childress grated
him with his fast gun an me unarmed-hits gentrys
reglar way i got no notion why hes fixin round tuh
kill me gents-

ass hauled bis colt from the leather and placed it on
 the bar bannister grabbed at his arm but he jerked
away he had noted the doubtful frown on the ranchers
face as childress talked and that was another stick on
the fire

  such whisper-talk was a part of the gunhand trade
the like of it would follow cass gently wherever he rode
tarring his name but to hear it shouted loud-

  he stepped away from the bar fists doubled striding
long toward childress

  it was a move the lank man had been waiting for

   he came charging fast arms milling head turtled his
jutting teeth bared he was lean and loosely jointed but
his bones were layered with a flat-muscled strength that
outweighed cass gentry by thirty pounds he had the
extra reach and he had a catlike quickness too despite
his look of awkwardness

  he took cass gentrys opening punch along the side of
the neck evading the full force of it with a roll of head
and tilt of elbow cass followed with a jolt into the ribs
ducking under a fist that slapped his ear

   the charge of attack collided them and childress lifted
his knee in a savage thrust for the groin cass was twist-
ing away pounding him off with a second right to the face
and childress knee struck with numbing shock against
his thigh

   cass sprang back giving ground and a flirt of his head
pulled away from the swinging arm that chased him the
fist fell short of his eye but the out-jabbed thumbnail
scraped a bloody gouge down his cheekbone

  childress bent into a crouch his clawed hands slowly
pawing rough-and-tumble was his mountaineer style
and in it buck childress had never met his equal

  he grinned a blood-smeared grin piling in for the
slaughter

dut cass gentry was no tenderhorn in the tough
- school of bunkhouse and barroom of rail camp and
botmer town he had learned his fighting lessons so he
was cool now his head was directing his strength

  a roughhouse brawler nine times in ten will beat a
straight fist-fighter the tenth time comes when the fight-
er dances clear stabbing in and then fading wary of the
clinches

  cass retreated from the lank mans charge sidling in
an arc that slowed buck childress for an instant as he
turned to follow in that instant cass was bounding for-
ward snaking a fist through the pawing defense smack-
ing knuckles into the speckled face left and right blows
that bruised and slashed-and he twisted back again
bobbing as childress smeared blood from his mouth

   stand damn ye an fight childress snarled

   come and get it  cass breathed and he shifted tactics
suddenly with a rush that foiled the mountaineers lunge
before it started he knew now that childress put no
striking force into his fists that claw and gouge and
throttle were the dangers they held if he watched the
knees and the lumberjacks trick of toes-

  he jumped inside the snatching hands his shoulders
humped and his chin tucked in and his elbows were
gunswift



threshing piston-joints as he hammered belly and lungs
and heart

  he had bored so close that the lank mans chief guns
were spiked the batter of fists drove childress back
he grabbed at cass clawing with a long-nailed hand that
raked neck and ear and trying desperately to clamp a
wrestlers lock to smother those ripping punches to tangle
his long legs with cass and throw him

  cass bulled free lifting two uppercuts that snapped
the taller mans head in a double bounce he weaved
away crouching and his hip bumped the bar he was
breathing hard and he could not see the others in the
room his vision was narrowed to that square of space
to the man crouched before him

ith his long hair flung wild with his bloody mouth
working buck childress was beyond pain or reason
he lurched at cass to pin him against the bar but cass
weaved right then left and lashed two overhand jolts to
the side of the face they landed with a beefy sound
and the solid force of them was a tingled warmth that cass
could feel from wrist to elbow

  they were numbing punches that caught buck chil-
dress in mid-leap that drove him sidewise along the bar
his legs sagged at the knees and he clawed the slabs for
support

  he managed to twist his body as he fell and some
blind instinct rolled him catlike bounced him up again
he shot out a kick as cass buffaloed ahead for the fin-
isher but cass had been watching for that

  he had checked himself and the kick fell short be-
fore childress could recover cass was darting in his
left hand grabbed the descending ankle hauling hard and
the mountain man was thrown he fell with a fling of
arms and his skull thumped the bar-front he was spilled
in a fork-legged sprawl his upper body propped by the
bar and his head lolling the nails of one spread hand
clawed the floor and the other hand pawed blindly behind
him

  you had-enough cass breathed now will you-
talk turkey

  but buck childress still wasnt licked beneath his
shirt clip-held at the base of his spine was an owls-head
pistol a snub-barreled stingy-gun and his hand fumbled
out with it he was lifting his bloody head his vacant
eyes and his gunhand was reaching out-

  cass kicked the wobbling arm he smashed his fist
into that bloody face driving the weight of his shoulder
behind the bending blows that pounded hollow thumps
along the bar he was snatching the gun jerking it from
strengthless fingers and he was first aware of the shouts
in the room when abel bannister tried to grapple him
in a bear-hug cass knocked the ranchers reaching arm
aside

  he straightened swabbing a wrist across his eyes-and
then it happened the roar of explosion burst in his
face the fire-flash and a slash of pain seared along his
ribs he jabbed the owls-head gun around and triggered
it firing as he staggered his spur hooked the limp leg of
buck childress and he stumbled he fell

  the bump jarred sense into his head again and sponged
the blur out of his eyes he saw the room the bar and
toppled table the booted legs and the faces he heard
the silence

  axton he croaked pushing up

  but it wasnt axton the hound-faced man stood lone
and frozen his skinny hands stretched above his head
in terror no it wasnt preach axton who had sneaked
a shot at cass to save buck childress from a beating and
who had drawn cass gentrys instinctive counter-fire

  she lay beyond axton flax-haired queenie and cass
gentrys own revolver had fallen from her hand she
was stretched supine with one white arm outflung and a
white hand clenched at the swell of her breasts where
the crimson was spreading

chapter xxii

the lady-killer

 ten came running cass heard them faintly saw
them dimly the tramping men clumped the outer
porch and they held their rifles ready beyond the door-
way the snaketrack punchers had lightened their
holsters and were spreading watchfully wide

  no boys preacher axton shouted it couldnt be
helped-it was accident she went crazy-wild and tried
to kill im she shot behind his back-

   figures shifted at the bright oblong of the door

  git gone you men cried axton no need for you
in this affair you hear we cant afford-theres trouble
enough without any more mixed into it there was urg-
ence in his words a sharp under-meaning and the new-
comers silently withdrew

  they heard the shots and got curious thats all
axton said quickly turning just a bunch from a card
game in one of my shacks this thing-it was queenies
own hellishness we gotto hush it up the fewer that
know-

  no one was listening the punchers stood awkwardly
silent staring from cass gentry to the humped hulk of
bannister who was kneeling beside the girl their faces
were grave unreadable

   i-i never seen who it was cass said his lips moved
carefully his voice was dull and his eyes looked blankly
down at the dangling gun in his hand she-i didnt
think-i placed her as behind the bar i took for granted
it was axton cuttin down on me

  but in his mind now he could see and vividly the
shape of unseen happenings queenie with that glitter in
her eye and her crooked red mouth screaming queenie
edging around the bar pushing close screaming at her
man he could see buck childress sprawled helpless and
a fist bashing his face and queenie grabbing the colt
from the bar grabbing it and aiming it and yelling as
the hammer fell

   and then cass gentrys quick blind bullet   

iitthere was no way to know he said id never shot
a woman  he stared into their blank faces

  she aint quite dead said abel bannister heavily
shes breathin yet but i dunno you axton git some
kind of waddin-cloth shes bleedin bad somebody bet-
ter fix er-i aint got quite the stommick fetch your pill-
chest-mebbe whiskey-hell almighty i cant say whats
to be done for her

  his ruddy face was tinged with gray and he rubbed
nervous hands against his thighs with a gesture of re-
vulsion he looked at cass gentry and his face was
harshly graven


argosy

  damn you he said almost tonelessly i should
known you had some scheme in hand when you trailed
me here damn you for a murderin dog gentry

  my back was turned cass said i had to shoot-

  they warned me of you the rancher said what
youre up to i dont know but its plain what happened
here you crowded childress into a fight for nothin i
could see and near bashed his brains out

  are you cockeyed crazy man the woman was
drunk and she did shoot wild but one of the boys was
about to grab er you had no cause for a single thing
you done unless it was to show-like on division street
-what a salty hellion you can be

  cass took it there was nothing he could say he
let the owls-head pistol drop and he paced two long
slow steps to pluck his hat from the floor

  the least you might do said bannister is fog for town
and send the doctor humpin or dont you care a-tall
the colt  lay near his foot and a thrust of boot spun
it across the planks take your cutter too-take er
and git long gone dont wait on us mister not any
skunktrack you named us but theres some breeds that
even a polecat might be too proud to ride with 

cass gentry rode he pointed the chestnuts head
up the lonely trail if there were watching eyes that
spied him from the shacks and thickets he did not know
if hidden rifles sighted him from the slopes he didnt
care

  he rode he rode and all he knew was the jounce of
his body and the cock of the chestnuts ears and the
dreary void inside him if he rode up or down in sun or
shade he couldnt tell nor did it matter

  wherever he rode-however far he stretched his trail
or however fast he might run it-he would never outrace
or outdistance the memory of bright-haired queenie with
blood staining her breast the lidded eyes the parted
lips the wax-white blankness he would recall the faces
of the snaketrack punchers and the gray look of abel
bannister

  it had happened now as had been long foretold the
years had caught up with cass gentry he had cut his
wolf loose once too often

  there were inner voices that wouldnt be stilled i
never would have-i couldnt tell-i didnt see who-
so the voices cried but who would listen or who would
heed or who would give a damn what excuses cass gen-
try offered abel bannister had spoken the answer to
that the snaketrack hands had told it in their set faces
in their glances that shifted away from cass gentrys
glance

  a carson city gambler had pulled his gun one night
on a knife-sticking mex in the tangle with a second
mex jumping him from behind this gambler had show-
ered some wide bullets it happened that a come-on girl
was in the line of fire everybody agreed it was accident
it was clear that the gambler hadnt meant to kill her
but just the same   

  cass recalled that gambling man his story was com-
mon knowledge it seemed that folks steered shy of his
table thereafter and he soon lost his job when he sat
into other games the players were apt to cash their chips
shortly leaving him sitting alone

  he took to hitting the bottle and he wasnt welcomed
around the bars because of the trouble he started he

accused total strangers of passing looks in his direction
or of giving him too wide a berth the women in the
other dives coined a name for him-the lady-killer-
and got to calling it loud when he appeared

  the gambler stood it for a month then he put his gun
against his ear and ended it

cass shook the chestnut into a run obeying some dumb
impulse to hurry the wind was cool against his face
and he traveled a sparkling silence the lock of his teeth
spread an ache along his jaw a numbness clamped his
upper body and he was sick and weary there was no
strength in him no fight nothing but emptiness he
came to the mouth of the valley pulling up sharply at the
fork of roads

  at length he pushed on in the direction of triangle
town

  riding off wouldnt solve it it wasnt in the cards nor
was cass gentry built that way he had signed his ticket
as a tough hand long ago and now he would play the
string out

  he had hoped for a little while yesterday 

  but yesterday was gone it was lying on the barroom
planks bleeding its life away the little pretense he had
enjoyed the new warmth that had shaped his thoughts
the careful schemes he had planned-all broken now shat-
tered and ended cass gentry was finished he had spoiled
his usefulness to mary ellen he was the lady-killer and
there was no place for him

chapter xxiii

nothing stirring except disaster

the afternoon was waning when he came within sight of
 triangle town a plank bridge across a gulley marked
the joining of the trail with the projection of wampum
street and cass slowed the chestnut here for a final
breather

  he was weak and weary and dead inside fatigue
flooded over him all in an instant lidding his eyes and
throbbing an ache through his bones the wound across
his upper ribs where queenies bullet had gouged had
stopped bleeding by now

  he had leaned in the saddle pressing his arm against
the dull pain and his sleeve was stained brown the ee
that childress had thumbed was considerably puffed but
otherwise he had no scars to show he was as fit to face
the situation as he ever was apt to be

  he rode down the placid thoroughfare past the red
schoolhouse and a spired white church and bearpaw was
one of an idling group that he spotted in the shade of the
elms near the exchange bank the grizzled wrangler
came clumping the walk as cass pulled in above

  nothin stirrin he called out gruffly and then his
voice broke abruptly at closer sight of cass whats
wrong boy yuh hurt

  im all right go over to farabaughs and tell the doc
hes needed at burnt mills if it aint already too late
womans been shot there he spoke slowly stiffly if
the doc aint home hell have to be reached as quick as can
be

  shore bearpaw nodded but what in thunder-

  see you said cass see you at the shack

  the wheel of fortune was shuttered but a man emerged
gunswift



from the happy hour as cass nudged the chestnut on and
he suddenly knew what he needed whisky-the counter-
shock

  a pain stabbed his side as he dismounted in front of the
saloon and he had to press his arm hard to hunch his
body before the sharpness eased and he could walk again i
when he reappeared with his bottle he led the horse in-
stead of mounting he chose the shortcut through an alley

  he did not head for the shack not right away

  the first gurgling drink was fire in his throat a tin-
gling warmth that was charged all through his body his
stomach constricted a shudder shook him and for a
moment he thought he would be sick he sat on a pack-
ing box behind some store and in a little while he was
all right

  he drank again lowering the bottle and staring ahead
at emptiness except for the soft creep of strength inside
him healing his hurts and his aches he was a blank the
chestnut turned to look at him jingling the bit when he
tilted the bottle a third time

  cass expelled a deep breath all right boy he said
ill make er now

  swiftly ogden came out of the door as he trudged the
path up to the shack one close look was enough for
swifty he let out a soft whistle

  what happened pardner

  plenty said cass this horse and rider had a long
tough day you tend to im-huh swifty-while i take
care of me

  how drunk are you boy swifty asked

  cass shook his head not as drunk as im gonna be

tte had washed himself at the basin had swathed his
upper chest with bandages of torn cloth was stretched
on the low bunk stripped to the waist when swifty re-
turned

  swifty knew when to talk and when to hold his jaw he
nodded toward the bandage how bad

  a scratch a close miss thats all the bleedins done
and the ony pains when i wrench myself

  how come swifty said and cass told him he spoke
with slow distinctness for whisky never blurred his voice
the two quick drinks he had downed while swifty was
gone had sobered him if anything they had chased the
rolling warmth out of his stomach and replaced it with
cool balance a steadiness

  so i reckon its up to you swifty he said when his
blunt recital was finished accident or not cass gentry
is washed up in triangle town theres some crooked-
ness out at burnt mills-mebbe the key to all the troubles
here but how and where it branches i still cant say

  anyway ive slammed that door i jumped too quick
and i missed theyll have plenty chance to cover up
their coyote tracks to pull more wool over peoples eyes

  grab some shuteye swifty said things never look
so bad come mornin

  theyre likely to look worse said cass we got to
face the facts here when we rode into triangle pardner
we had the town on our side the decent folks the lead-
in men like farabaugh frank irish and bannister as it
turned out-they wanted to see this mess cleared up

  the little fellers the average townsman and small
rancher was ready to back the play of any man whod
dig to the bottom of things thats why i was able to
throw my weight around so free if i tromped the toes

of honest men-like bannister-they faced their cards
pronto if i crowded the crooks there was no harm done
but now when this queenie story spreads-

  he stared at the planks of the bunk above reach me
that bottle swifty

  look pardner swifty said hastily there aint no
use-

  he bit off the words beneath the stare that cass turned
upon him swifty ogden had seen that iobk before and
it was not a pleasant sight

  a stiff-legged walk and that stare in his eyes were the
only signs of drunkenness cass gentry would show he
would talk and act real sensible but swifty knew what
was inside of him

  cass drank he wiped his mouth from now on he
said i never could be sure i couldnt tell from the
look of a man or the tone of his voice or his attitude if
he had some deviltry to hide or if it was his natural way to
face a woman-killer

  any proof i might show would be tainted with the stink
ive raised today and the hell of it swifty is that we
were gettin somewheres there was childress axton par-
sons vic barth wed choused into the open there was last
nights bullet that missed my ear-

tdearpaw came in he backed against the closed door
wheezing out his breath peering nearsightedly through
the dusk-haze

  the doc was aready out tords that direction he said
huskily i sent a rider to carry im word he pawed a
hand across his grizzled mustache she aint dead yit she
was still alive when bannister left him an his snaketrack
are down in town

  cass sat up he lifted his feet to the floor and the
whiskey hit him a buoyancy was in his body an airy
lightness and a dizziness roared up to his brain exploding
there

  he shook his head blinking the sparkled blankness
from his eyes and the rocking room steadied he pushed
up and he stood there strong and steady his mind was
clear and sharp and his body had shed its ailments he
was quick and keen he could run on feathered feet or
sing a song or dance a jig-step

  might happened to any man bearpaw said quickly
plain to hell from what they said that it was accident
id set tight though till the talk blows past them fools
yonder- 

  its no use bearpaw swifty said

  but its no confounded sense to flaunt the face of the
town that happy hour bunch has spread the story all
whichaways an the rats has crawled from their holes to
comb their whiskers vic barth an quigg re struttin high
ant that hook-nosed gunman bannister fired last night
feller cass tangled with on division street is crowin
loud-mouth-

  swifty shook his head gesturing silence

  cass was buttoning a clean gray fehirt he set his hat
at a cock buckled his gunbelt on the  was feather
light it seemed to leap into the swift deft fingers that
executed a practice draw he faced bearpaw and swifty
as he returned the gun to holster

  i never yet made myself hard to find he said and
nows no time to start it if triangle towns got ques-
tions to ask ill be on deck to answer em you two
steer clear you hear me i dont need help nor com-


argosy

pany and i dont need any advice ill advise myself
he was nearing the door when the young un knocked
the boy squeezed inside with a breathless message

  ben quiggs on his way here to warn you from town

four them nesters just rode in from the mills the woman

theyre talkin dangerous the young un said i

  the hunched old wrangler stared at the slamming door
he glared at duke costellos boy moving his hands in a
spread of helplessness theyll be shot to dollrags he
gasped wheres my rifle-gun i gotta find some way-
his jaw sagged his gnarled fists clenched and he
pushed past the young un his bracketed rifle was for-
gotten on the wall as he headed across the weed-grown
fields in a hobble-legged run his mouth was stretched
wide with the wheeze of his breath and his arms flailed the
twilight shadows

  gotta he whimpered gotta stop em
                t

chapter xxiv

the badge i wear

cass gentry walked with a stiff-kneed stride with
his shoulders squared and arms swinging free and he
was tuned to the earth he trod to the evening wind to
that lone pale star in dark infinity

  he was twelve feet tall and with every breath he grew
another inch he was charged with a super-strength a
super-wisdom he could race the wind or jump those yon-
der housetops no sound was too small for him to hear no
sight too dim to see and he could cover all the world with
his understanding

  he wasnt drunk not even a little bit he was soberer
he told himself than any man had ever been or any man
had a right to be a drunk man staggers but cass gentry
walked with steadfast feet a drunk man mumbles but
cass gentrys tongue was glib with words that he never
heard before so many polished words that his throat wanted
to sing em a drunk man is full of storm and temper of
bluster and brag but cass gentry was as calm and cool as
an icicle

  he meant no harm to any fellow-man he was walking
in peace as was his right and privilege and he would not
raise his voice or lift his fist unless compelled to self-
defense is-

  across the bare field stiff-striding past the loom of a
barn a shadow-shed a rubbish heap in the alley he en-

tered a darker split between buildings and emerged on
wampum street

  with his extra-sight he saw the street enlarged stretched
wide and curving long it was a quiet sunday street its
public lamps unlighted its roadway barren its walks thinly
straggled with movement a knot of figures was clustered
beneath the white globe that fronted the elk hotel and
there were ten more shining splotches spaced along he
nodded solemnly as he turned up the walk bootheels
thumping

  self-defense is the first law of nature yeah that was
the ticket

  the happy hour was the place that was where they
would gather and the thicker they flocked the more pleased
cass gentry would be he could have reached the lights of
the saloon in one giant stride the length of a block but
he kept to his steady pace a buzz of talk poured from the
door as he approached and he thought that he might
drown it out with one good bellow

  but that would be a drunkards act and cass gentry
was a snowman of sobriety a man with wild whisky in
him would not have remembered as cass gentry did to
pause outside the doorway and let his eyes adjust to the
glow of inner lights and to jiggle the butt of his colt
loosening the steel in its holster

  cass gentry even remembered to bend down his head as
he pushed through the swinging panels for he towered
eighteen feet by then a mountain oak with leaves in his
hair

  he saw the expanse of the happy hour with utmost
clarity the narrow room had crowded since he bought
his bottle here the four-five customers had increased to
forty men sat around the tables and a thick queue lined
the bar

  cass turned his head in slow survey standing just in-
side the door and he heard the sounds that abruptly
dwindled faces moved in a curious staring unison and
slow figures withdrew fading back from him as he stepped
to the head of the bar he slapped his left hand on the
polished plank

  whisky-

tte looked down the room-and saw the faces of
-- triangle town he saw them in a sort of bright de-
tachment as if happy hour had a roof of brilliant glass
through which cass gentry peered down upon lesser
creatures except for this glassy separation he might have
reached out his arm and cuffed them or pinched a head
between his fingers he stood and watched them he
looked his steady challenge at them one and all

  at abel bannister with the listeners thick around his
snaketrack table at vic barth the dark deputy sitting
bolt upright and twisted around in his chair at axton
one of four grouped at the bar at the big and the little
he looked at the bartender and at mr frank irish and at
hop randolph the limpy gambling man

  he could have made a mighty speech to them but his
voice would have blown them down he stood and waited
and the room throbbed to the same slow tempo that was
in the measured hammer of his heart

  that gave him his sense of time-that hammering it
was like a wonderful big clock

  he seemed to know by some sixth sense even before he
heard the squeak of the entrance door and his glance
flicked sidewise that swifty ogden would be standing
gunswift



there swifty ogden small and dapper with his face wiped
blank of expression with his thumb hooked daintily over
his belt

  the same reasons that had pushed cass gentry had
brought swifty here he came because he was built that
way and because it had to be

  the room stirred abel bannister slowly lifted from
his chair staring at cass and opening his mouth then
pressed his lips together and sank down again there
was a breath of sound as vic barth his dark eyes shut-
tling came to his feet

  you were warned from the streets gentry he said
he held his hands carefully in view stroking the palms
together you got one minute to clear out of here

  one instant there were five men at the table between
vic barth and cass next instant they had vanished
creeping the sawdust hugging the floor cass eyed the
deputy unanswering and other men squatted suddenly
along the bar

  you hear me gentry vic barth said and cass saw
the tightening of the deputys neck cords his muscles
bunching for the showdown jump

  cass- said a soft voice from the doorway i want
you to come with me cass

  mary ellen came forward and put her steady fingers on
his arm



she was darkly dressed and her hair had blown awry
thebrown hand spread against her bodice moved with
the swell of her breath her face was turned up to cass
and her eyes saw him alone in the room

  she held herself proudly and some trick of the barroom
lamps made her features indistinct in his sight as though
she stood remote and visionary in a calm pale glow he
could shake his head and she would vanish-

  but he could not shake those fingers tight upon his
arm they had fastened there compelling and the touch
of them was a tenderness cass gentry had never known
they were a leap of his heart a sob in his throat a reality
and and a sanity too blinding-bright for instant under-
standing

  the sound of her voice tjje sight and touch of her-
and god knows how and why these little things did what
they did to him they shocked all the buoyance all the
overweening strength from the cass gentry giant they
shriveled and humbled him and he was feebly small and
blindly afraid

  the strength that flowed from her hand was the force
that held him upright the courage that hushed his fran-
tic shout the balance that restrained him from panic-
flight to escape the death in this room

  yes he whispered yes ill come and he followed
the pull of ker hand toward the doorway

his sight was blind his brain was blank to the in-
stant happenings in the crowded bar even swifty
ogden did not observe the scope of them

  the sword of violence had been shivering above the
room suspended by the thinnest hair and mary ellens
presence might not have stayed the death-stroke if vic
barth had signaled it the holocaust was averted by the
swift reaction of other men to the girls appearance

  the hook-nosed gunman who had made his boasts the
barrel-bellied fellow who had lost his job as aftermath to
his street fight with cass had eased out his revolver he

stood along the wall his actions concealed by intermediate
figures and he waslifting the barrel slowly when he be-
came aware of watchful eyes

  abel bannister was staring across at him jaw jutted
the snaketrack boss had pushed back his chair and his
right hand was hidden from the gunmans view mr
hook-nose lowered his weapon returned it to holster

  axtons group along the bar had the same experience
three of them had dropped their fists to gun-butts they
were posed stiffly all their attention centered upon vic
barth when the hiss of axtons breath the roll of his eyes
warned the three of hop randolph

  the slight-bodied faro dealer sat at a table six feet dis-
tant he had turned toward them and the gun in his lap
was slightly tilted hop randolph was expressionless but
the round black eye of the pistol stared ominously

  and frank irish too had been quick to act the brisk
little banker had hopped up at sight of mary ellen he
stepped forward as the tug of her hand pulled cass gen-
try back blocking vic barths path by his move he made
his gesture for the whole room to see sweeping off his
sunday and bending his white-tufted head in a smil-
ing bow

  good evenin my dear he said as if mary ellen
were walking the street to church proper and ladylike

  the happy hour understood and approved that ges-
ture   

outside in the thin blue darkness cass gentry walked
the solemn-sounding planks to nowhere mary ellen
had his arm and he was a child who needed leading if his
foot dragged if his step wavered it was weakness rather
than intoxication

  his body was damp with the perspiration that had poured
forth as the doors of the happy hour fluttered behind
them swift waves of fever heat of shuddering cold had
pulsed through him banishing the whisky-haze he was
truly sober-nerve-shocked into sobriety

  they walked in silence swifty ogden trailing

  there had been death in that place the sight of mary
ellen standing beside him had revealed the clear pic-
ture of it and the flashing realization that she was fac-
ing it with him had brought terror to cass gentry he
still shivered with the thought of what she had risked
his brain was numb with the might-have-beens

  they had crossed the packed dirt of wampum street
they went along a footpath with the whisper of trees
above them and yellow-windowed houses lined ahead
cass felt the tremor in her hand then and she halted
abruptly she spoke some soft sound a throaty murmur-
ing and stepped away from him her hand reached out
toward the trunk of a tree

  dont he said dont look at me

  he lifted his head in a moment and he knew then
that her murmur had been a muffled sob she was leaned
against the tree her wrist pressed against her mouth and
her shoulders were shaking

  i asked for it cass said dully you shouldnt-i
never was worth the bother

  he spoke in a strangers tones the hollow-sounding
words came from his without effort without thought as if
he were a dummy on a stage-actors knee he knew where
he was-it was council street he knew that swifty had
halted at a distance and that bearpaw had also followed
them


argosy

  the place was triangle town and he was cass gentry
yet as he looked at mary ellen these realities seemed
to fade and he stood with her in some far beyond the two
of them hemmed in by nothingness

  i had to she answered presently when bearpaw
came running-when i heard that you-i was glad to do
it it was a danger i could share i couldnt let you throw
yourself away

  you lowered yourself cass said you climbed down
into my gutter what happened was my own blame i
cooked your chances today i killed a woman at the
mills-

  for me she said quickly no matter why or how
it happened i share the responsibility i told you that
i accepted the risks i was proud-proud cant you under-
stand-to show the men in that place how my loyalties
stood im not backing down on our bargain cass gen-
try though that neednt stop you if you still want to
quit

  quit he echoed the word but im no use my
bolt is shot here the talk was bound to spread and i had
to face it i couldnt run and hide my head

  but you did   she exclaimed you crawled in a bot-
tle and hid you quit like a yellow dog you drank your-
self brave enough to swagger your body into something
your mind was afraid of ive seen my father do the
same	-

cass looked at her blankly yeah he said in a mo-
ment i can see youre right i-i never figured it
quite that way but now that you tell it-why sure im
no better than that carson city gambler he shot his brains
out and i tried to fix er so that others would do the
same for me i went yellow on myself

  you didnt  she cried you didnt realize youre no
coward-youre just a fool cass gentry a stubborn hot-
headed special kind of fool that i happen to know being
matt mchales daughter

  cass shook his head it would been a different thing
with him he was-well he had his reputation here he
wore no killers badge his neighbor folks would under-
stand-

  and we can make them understand right now she
said no man wears a killers badge unless he pins it on
himself thats what i must make you see did you ride
to burnt mills today just to earn your wages did you
have the dollar sign pinned on your vest

damn the wages he said thickly i rode because-
i know why it was because you found me helpless
because the odds were long against me -it was my badge
you wore today if your gun killed a woman then i helped
to aim it how can i make you see the way i feel

  the only fear i had running down the street was that
id reach the place too late i wanted all triangle town
to be in the happy hour i wanted to show them-and
you above them all-that i believed in you that i trusted
you- 

  cass couldnt say a word he couldnt move he couldnt
see her she was no more than a voice in his heart and the
starlight gleam through the branches

  suppose it had been my father badgered there mary
ellen said does that help you understand how i felt
would i have had a single doubt would anyone deny
that i belonged beside him

  but thats just make-believe said cass slowly you

owe no debt to me i took the risks of your job on the

gunswifts terms

  you lie her voice was thin raggedly breathed cass
saw the shadow-move of her body and her fingers were
gripped up on his arm again weve never had those
termsbetween us you must have felt as i feel you know
its more than make-believe youre all ive got dont quit
me cass dont take my strength away-

  she was in his arms suddenly her body pressed close
against him taut-muscled shivering with the strain of
wild emotions her lips were against his lips she was
murmuring brokenly and cass kissed her hair and the
tears upon her cheek

  then like a fool he loosed his arms and let her go

chapter xxv

no beacon tonight

titary ellen sat in the vine-shaded shadow of the
doctors porch the sting of tears was still in her eyes
and her throat had still to subdue the sobbing breathless-
ness

  except for the bracket lamp in the entrance hall the
doctors house was dark the whole street was dimly doz-
ing how many minutes had passed since she sat there
bonnet in her lap waiting to start for the evening service
how long since bearpaw came running

  she had not been afraid-thank god for that there
had been no qualms no hesitations from the instant
bearpaw blurted his message the knowledge of what
she must do had been an instant realization she had
known as old bearpaw had seemed to know that she was
the key to the situation at the happy hour she alone
could stop cass gentry

  and as she ran the footpath skirts in hand outspeeding
winded bearpaw she had felt a pride instead of fear to
face a common foe to share the danger to show cass
gentry and triangle town how her loyalties listed-oh it
was a warmth in her breast an exaltation

  in the smoky silent room an instinct had directed her
instinct told her what to say and how to touch his arm
just so and chose the words she had to speak to him in
the safety-shade of that tree just down the street

  but something else something wilder and deeper had
put her in his arms did she love this man this stranger
was it more than his misery her pity for his need that had
given her lips to him

  she thought of martin burdette of martins arms and
his lips upon her own and the murmur of his voice against
her ear she had never questioned her love for martin
the happiness that she would find with him and yesterday
the loss of martin had been a deep hurt that would never
ease now she stroked her fingertips over her mouth and
stared at the night and could not weigh her own emo-
tions

  she stood up presently and found her bonnet near the
steps the dim silence of the house was suddenly repel-
lant she thought of the woman in the upper bedroom
ada farabaugh in her cripples chair and knew that a
high sharp voice would call out at the sound of her en-
trance

  she had no cheerful word to spare to mrs farabaugh
not now time enough to face those sullen eyes the poor
pain-ravaged features when the gossips of triangle town
gunswift	

had scurried to the sickroom to relate the incident at the
happy hour

  mary ellen went down the path to the gate let them
let the gossips talk let them mumble and whisper and
stare she held her head high as she walked the boards
of wampum street toward the church martin burdette
and triangle town had broken her courage once but
now she was matt mchales daughter again matt mc-
hales daughter till the last wolf was hung

  the services had already started when she reached the
spired building a meager congregation was singing abide
with me and few heads turned when she took her seat at
the rear she sat with her bonnet bent humbly grateful
for the solemn hush that followed the singing she joined
the other murmuring voices in the chanted responses to
the public prayer her eyes closed when the preacher be-
gan to speak

  mary ellen heard his words without meaning finding a
comfort in the sleepy drone of them in the middle of the
closing hymn she made a quiet exit it was no fear of star-
ing eyes or nodding whispers that hurried her but rather
that she wanted no disturbance of the sense of peace she
had found

wampum street was almost deserted and the
shadows of council street were as placid as her
thoughts she peered ahead thinking she might see a
light from the doctors office and for an instant she did
not understand her own puzzled frown something-yes
the lamp in the hall the front of the house was totally
dark now perhaps the wick had burned down

  mrs farabaugh had remained in her room all day she
had been asleep when mary ellen went down to sit on
the porch in the dusk and wait for church time for she
had not replied to a tap on her door her usual needs
were within reach beside the bed and it was only upon
the rare occasions that ada farabaughs warped pride
called for any assistance she had a limited scope of move-
ment despite her ailment

  no it was nonsense the lamp had burned out nothing
more yet mary ellen remembered how obviously wor-
ried the doctor had been these last few days he had said
nothing of course but mary ellen had seen the grave lines
that etched his face when he spoke to his wife it was
curious too about the lamp it customarily burned all
night the doctors beacon and one of maggies daily
chores was to tend it just before she started home

  mary ellen hurried she pushed through the picket
gate ran up the path the front door was quartered open
-she had not latched it tightly perhaps-and she stood
briefly in the hallway dark breathing shallowly reaching
for the matches on the little hall table she plucked a
sheaf of them and the feel of the slender sticks the fa-
miliar scents of medication were somehow reassuring

  her nerves were strung too tight that was the answer
she was still keyed subconsciously to the wracking emo-
tions of that scene in the happy hour to such breathless
shocks as that bullet which had blasted past her own cheek
at cass gentry in the stable last night

  a careless cook a burnt-out lamp the normal silence of
a sleeping house-and out of these simplicities she was
creating an apprehension that slowed her step that vis-
ioned dangers in the loom of every familiar shadow

  she halted at the foot of the stairs to listen no sound
from above she heard the solemn strokes of the tall clock

that faced the outer door and the steady tick-tock beat em-
phasized the gloom the overspreading hush she had a silly
impulse to call ada farabaughs name but she checked it
instantly she struck a match and the puffing glow of the
flame was comforting

che went up the stairs the match burned out as she
 reached the upper hall but there was light enough from
the end window to see her way her and pushed along the
papered wall toward the door of her room and she was
reaching automatically for the knob when double warning
snatched her fingers back

   she could see the faint luminance from the double win-
dows beyond her bed and the knob was not m reach her
door was open yet she had locked it little more than an
hour ago

   she might have run or screamed or obeyed any one
of ten frantic instincts instead held stiffly in some stronger
compulsion her hand slashed a match down the door frame
in its gleam she saw her room disheveled the bundle
from martin brudettes office had been ripped open its
contents littered the floor

  mary ellen stepped back her dread was a torrent
leaping out at her mrs farabaugh- she screamed
but her voice was only a breath a whisper

  ada-ada the name came shrilly from her throat
piercing the hush echoing the walls resounding wild

-	the tiny flame in her hand the shivering glow jerked
along the hall it cast a yellow flicker a shadow-leap
through the narrow passage it jumped ahead toward the
back window toward the blank outline of mrs fara-
baughs door and it revealed the streak of white and the
white oval at the base of the rear bedroom entrance

   the streak of white was ada farabaughs arm stretched
pleadingly toward the hallway runner the oval of white
was her hair-fringed face turned in agony toward mary
ellen

   the match-glow faded winking out with mary ellens
cry but its gleam had endured sufficiently to show the
final ugliness-the twisted mouth the distended eyes the
cruel marks of the murder which had released the doctors
wife from the prison of her cripples chair

cigures had appeared in the doorways of neighboring
houses in response to the girls first scream lamps
shone from the porches voices called and runners came
pelting from every direction along dim council street
three men were crowding through the doctors gate to
shout queries at mary ellen as she stumbled down the
steps toward them

   she could not answer she had no voice they charged
past her into the dark house and one of them carried a
shotgun other men hurried up and women too and the
night was roused with a babble of sounds with the firefly
specks of lanterns

   the blurred hours following were chaos

   council street became the hub of triangle town fig-
ures dotted the yards clogged the footpaths wavered the
roadway in sluggish parade the murder of ada fara-
baugh was an earthquake shock that sundered deep and
spread its tremors wide

   fear merged with the mystery that raced through the
town and beyond a hundred rumors passed from busy
mouths to eager ears rage and alarm flowed from house
to house from group to whispering group and swift actions

would result before the hands of the triangle clocks
pointed midnight

  in the early mill of excitement the doctors house was
a bedlam with a hundred gawkers thronged outside it and
twenty searchers tramping and rooting through the rooms
mary ellen huddled in a chair on the porch across the
street ringed in by flustered housewives and nightgowned
youngsters could only mutter over and over that she knew
nothing more she had gone to church leaving ada fara-
baugh sleeping she had returned to find her murdered

  ben quigg and his deputies when they appeared did
little to soothe the turmoil they led a second noisy prowl
through the house sent men to search the nearby yards
and the alley and the sum of their efforts was an acci-
dental bullet that one volunteer searcher shot into the leg
of another

  the neighborhood was still so disorganized that no one
had foresight enough to halt dr farabaugh when he
turned his buggy in from wampum street half an hour
later

  it was obvious that he was unaware of the situation for
his horse moved at the usual plodding pace and once or
twice the doctor leaned his head out to ask what the devil
was going on here nobody answered they stood dumbly
aside and let him come on until he could see the crowd
in front of his fence he hit his horse a lick and came
a-helling

  the women who notice such things said that he was
the coolest man on the street once he had shaken off the
first staggering impact of the news it was mary ellen
who finally told him she scooted off the neighbors porch
when somebody announced that his buggy was coming
pushing people out of her way and calling out to him as
she ran the doctor piled down from his seat grabbing
her as she flung her arms out to him some who hap-
pened to stand nearby heard what she said

  oh doctor-doctor-shes dead adas dead and
its my fault-i left her alone i led the killers to your
house-i helped to murder her

  the tall man lifted her up light as a feather when her
head fell forward and she fainted

the women had to admire the iron discipline that the
the haggard doctor demonstrated to a man of medi-
cine the living are more important than the dead and
george farabaughs training was not forgotten even in his
own extremity

  he carried mary ellen to the neighbors parlor and
mixed a draught for her before crossing the street to the
room where his murdered wife lay men made a silent
pathway for his gaunt figure slump-shouldered that
moved with dragging step they understood the terrible
emotion that cracked his voice when he stood beside the

body of his ada staring down at the bed where ben
quiggs big dutchman had placed her

  get out damn you he had shouted to the sheriff and
his crew get out before i throw you out and men
had backed away from the wildness in his eyes the dis-
tortion of his bearded face to close the door and leave
him alone with his dead

  for another hour the hubbub continued crazy rumors
circulated there was one report that mary ellen mchale
had admitted the murder another said that ada fara-
baughs death was the result of a shooting on the previous
evening when gunfire had been heard in the neighborhood
such stories did not travel far however for steps were
soon taken that returned common sense to triangle town

  the foremost men of triangle gathered at the palace
hotel and formed a citizens committee frank irish
henry gaunt eli lombard dan venable and thirty more
respected freeholders took the towns affairs in charge

  their first move was to put ben quigg in his place he
was told to crawl into his office and stay there abel ban-
nister who had decided to spend the night at the elk and
catch up on his sleep was hauled from his bed to organize
the manhunt in another twenty minutes the streets had
been cleared rifle-armed riders were patrolling the thor-
oughfares and some measure of calm was being restored

  women who had said that they would keep every light
in their houses burning so long as that murderer roamed
loose and no household was safe-these women considered
the price of kerosene and blew out their lamps men who
had decided to keep a weapon handy when they crawled
into their blankets thought better of this discomfort by
morning the following conclusions had been accepted

  ada farabaugh according to her husbands report had
come to her death as the result of strangulation or suffoca-
tion the bruise on her forehead might have been inflicted
by the murderer in attempting to stun her or might have
been caused by her own struggles to escape because of
the feeble state of her health no great amount of strength
had been required to force her face into her pillow and
hold her there

  a careful questioning at every home in theneighbor-
hood and of everyone who had been near the section in
the early evening was of small avail no unusual sound
had been heard until mary ellen began her screaming
no one had been seen to enter the doctors house nor had
any suspicious action occurred in the vicinity

  the obvious deduction as to the cause and the general
pattern of the crime was soon reached some sly prowler
had entered the house to secure certain papers of value
in the bundle of matthew mchales possessions he had
forced the door to mary ellens room-the knife-marks
were plain upon the wood-and the sleeping invalid had
been wakened murder had silenced her betraying outcries

bait for the big hook

the more mike would pull the more the man
on the hook would struggle and thrash
through the water

            by richard sale

          author of design for valor old chainmouth etc

        heres the unforgettable story of a master fisherman who had lost
        the will to live hed seen everything and done everything-and
        then he got a new kind of fighting fish on the end of his line

young sherman found pop shannon by the pool
tossing in mullet to tildy and her son jupiter he
was a very fresh and powerful son and tildy who
was as fine and big a porpoise as had ever butted a shark
let him maul her unmercifully for a time

 but when she decided that she had had enough she
would put her head down and ram him broadside and
take all the playfulness out of him

  it was the underwater zoo of course down at laconia
florida it was the only thing of its kind in the world a
giant pool where all the species of the briny deep were
placed in the tank together to live the same sort of life
and possibly find the same sort of death as they would
in their fight for survival in the atlantic which actually
was less than quarter of a mile away plainly visible from
the summit of the big pool

 pop said young sherman youre wanted in the
office id swear i saw the big boss himself

  the big boss said pop shannon spilling the rest of
the mullet overboard and watching the two porpoises scat-
ter for them he climbed to his feet you mean mike
descorts you must mean mike on account of the
other big boss mr andersons down at guyacil after
broadbills i hear

  it looked like mike descorts to me said young sher-
man anyhow hes in the office with dr bisbee and an-
other gent who looks like something out of an undertaking
parlor

  well said pop shannon pleased reckon ill have
to go in and see whats what mike dont get down this
way often no more itll be a real pleasure to see him
he ambled off toward the office

before they had put him on the payroll of the under-
water zoo pop shannon had been captain of his own
boat a charter fisherman which had roamed the seas from




argosy

nova scotia to florida to bimini and cat cay to mexico
to the nameless river in cuba

  during the winter you could have found him below
the causeway at miami beach and when you wanted to
pay out his money and catch fish you could count on
capn pop shannon he was a blood brother he knew
where they were and what they were eating and how they
wanted it served up

  the directors of the underwater zoo were john an-
derson and michael descorts both of them young and
wealthy sportsmen they had put their money into the
concrete miracle on highway  and it had begun to pay
them dividends

  a chance remark from pop about how wonderful it would
be to see fish living as they lived in the sea except that
you could watch them through a porthole had influenced
them to build the zoo they gave pop the job of taking
care of the place dr bisbee was the actual curator and
young sherman was his assistant but pops job was one
of free-lance design he about ran the whole place he
loved it and in his way he loved the fish

  and you only had to look at the way tildy the porpoise
behaved to see that her heart belonged to pop

  pop shannon went into the administration office and was
gratified to see that his visitor was mike descorts they
shook hands and then mike descorts hugged him

  you old barnacle-grabber mike exclaimed its good
to see you again it really is ive been away from here
too long

  thats a fact said pop shannon you aint been
down this way for a helluva long time mike what did
you think of that white shark we landed eh some
baby

  old chainmouth said mike descorts ill say he
was some baby and i got your inference of course i
shouldnt have sent a professional sportsman down to get
that mako but i thought you were getting too old for that
kind of stuff pop that was the only reason i did it
maybe you was right said pop shannon your paid
hand did land a mako finally although its a scrawny crit-
ter and i sure was done in after chainmouth got through
with me maybe id just better stick to guidin the boats
out and let the fishin to the younger fry

  well said mike descorts thats what i want you to
do for me pop thats why im down here im bored
stiff i want to catch fish new fish new kinds of fish sea
serpents maybe even killer whales i want some excite-
ment and youre the guy to find it for me hows the
baby porpoise

  big enough to roll you around said pop whynt
you go out and feed him a few mullet hell love you
for it his name is jupiter and hell come at call try it
i will said mike and went out to the pool

  pop shannon stared at dr bisbee pop said i seen
you waggin a hand at me that was what you wanted
me to do wasnt it

  yes pop said dr bisbee we wanted to talk to
you this is dr edward nichols

  oh said pop another scientist eh

  no said dr bisbee dr nichols is an md pot
a phd he happens to be the personal physician of mr
descorts and that is what we wanted to talk to you
about

  oho said pop shannon dully he rubbed his chin
with his hand the bristles scratching noisily too bad

i reckon hes sick then i thought when i come in that
he didnt look well at all hes all dark under the eyes
and he seems kinda scared and he aint in proper shape
mr shannon said dr nichols in a grave voice
mr descorts is in a desperate condition you would
not think so to look at him but nevertheless its quite
true

  whats wrong with him

  he is in the grip of a severe nervous breakdown we
dont know exactly what caused it but it is very real to
him-so real that he has attempted to take his own life
at least once

top shannon was horror-struck mike descorts
had always been a gay and uninhibited soul with a
tanned body and a broad back and a love of hundreds
of pounds of fighting muscle on the end of the line some-
thing was wrong he had seen that himself but it was hard
to believe that a guy like mike descorts would try to com-
mit suicide

  he was in love with a young woman in new york
said dr nichols and she treated him pretty badly led
him on as long as it suited her then she married
another chap i think that was what did it mr des-
corts instantly began to lead a wild life he kept looking
for excitement and he didnt find it he wanted to leap
from his apartment one day and we stopped him ive
been trying to persuade him to get back to fishing and
he finally gave in

  what do you want me to do pop shannon said
awed

  youre to use the big boat said dr bisbee the
seventy-footer striped marlin youre to take mr des-
corts fishing

  gosh pop shannon said ill take him fishing all
right but its kind of a responsibility is he all over
-that stuff i mean he wouldnt try again-

  he might said dr nichols look here shannon
you must understand this mr descorts is in a precarious
mental state he has a feeling of complete boredom
actually it is frustration youll have to watch him all
the time youll have to see that he doesnt brood and
more than that you have got to give him legitimate hope
of excitement now understand me youll undoubtedly
catch fish wont you

  sure said pop shannon heavily i never wet a
hull offshore yet but that i didnt bring back something
to show on the hook

  this time youve got to do more than that said dr
nichols you must paint a splendid picture of adven-
ture perhaps it doesnt exist then make it up make
up some gigantic old killer of the seas and give him
a name and put him far offshore someplace where you
wouldnt usually go make it sound new to mr descorts
tell him that fifty people have hooked the fish and never
landed it

  like with old chainmouth you mean

  yes though chainmouth was a real shark with a real
past and it was a pity that descorts wasnt the one to
land him anyway you understand me

  yes sure said pop but when he finds out there
aint no such fish

  hes not to find out maybe you wont find the fish
and if he should get a big one on by chance say that that
is it give him excitement its got to be new to him
bait for the big hook



hes fished au his life so its up to you to give him a new
wrinkle in the way of fishing i dont know how and i
dont know where thats your problem

  yeah said pop shannon dully my problem it
looks like i might have to try and hook into an orca if
everything else fails

  then do it

  pop looked wry did you ever see an orca its the
blackfish doc a killer-whale runnin thirty feet long
and going to two tons if we ever made one of them babies
mad hed knock the striped marlin into splinters that
would be excitement sure enough

  it would be the best thing for him in the world said
dr nichols cheerfully

  if he lived through it said pop shannon im get-
ting old but i aint so old i wanta stand next to a grave
on a lot o squid skins and go lopin over the edge still
thats mighty sad about mike i reckon ive gotta help
him out somehow

  dr bisbee whispered hes coming back pop talk
fast dont let him suspect youve been told anything

top was stuffing his pipe his back to the door he
drawled as if he were finishing up a story well sir
the old marlin just stood there in the water on his tail
and he waved that bill at me just as pert as you please
and then he flips it down and cuts my line and then he
rams a hole through my transom and one through my
planking and then he goes down deep home and lets me
limp all the way to nassau with a hole in my bilge

  mike descorts had come in he said whats this
pop a fish story

  aint no fish story mike pop said its the gods
truth so help me i was telling the doc here about baby
face

  well what about baby face

  you mean you never heard o baby face pop said
in surprise why mike where you been fishing these
last years in trout streams baby face is the biggest old
marlin i ever seen in my life hell go to a half a ton the
day a man can catch him and they sure have tried blue
marlin that hangs off the bahamas about seventy miles

  i hooked into him once just once id heard about
this baby face and i went lookin for him and i finally
raised him lord he was the bigges marlin god ever made
and i ever hope to see thick around as a sea skiff and
longern old chainmouth

  he kept my hook and he kept my line and he stole
some o my heart i played him for six hours before he
snapped my thread and he was just teasin with me

  and when he broached and stood on his tail there
wavin that spear at me like i was a kid askin for lolly-
pops i do swear and declare that there was ten big hooks
hangin in his jaw from  to  with stainless steel
wire leaders flashin in the sun and him waitin for time
and the sea to rust them out and off

  ijo one spoke for a moment then mike descorts said
quietly do you think pop that you could ever raise
him again

  aye pop shannon replied ten hooks in hisn jaw
he was raised ten times before i left my evans there he-
can be raised

  there was a fine glow in mike descorts eyes a glow x
that had not been there for a long time and it was nice to
see

tut after thirteen days that eager light had vanished
again and mike descorts was morose once more and
he was thinking too much pop shannon could see it
plainly and it worried him

   pop wished vainly that he had brought young sherman
along or someone else who could really help for nigger
john was no help at all

   nigger john could handle the striped marlin as well as
anyone but he could not talk mike descorts out of the
sinister fog that was sweeping in over his mind

   nor could pop at this point by stalling and wander-
ing through the islands of the bahama group pop had
managed to spend a week of the trip reaching the mythical
grounds where the equally mythical baby face swam the
deep and crossed the reefs

   once at the ground there could be no more stalling for
six days they had cut the waters off the emerald key
east of eleuthera using all sorts of rigs and baits with no
luck at all as a matter of fact it was not really marlin
water it was too green and too shallow and there were
reefs

   descorts said once pop are you sure this is the spot
this isnt big marlin water its off a little more east isnt
it you must have made a mistake

   since pop had never been there before he hadnt made
any mistake but he could not count on the weather
and he was in strange waters so he picked a spot close to
emerald key so that they could run into a cove if the
wind blew

   he didnt want to go east because if descorts once
started east looking for that fish he might go too far
a fisherman will often do that

   this is the spot pop said right off there from the
key on a southwest tangent i raised him

   he nodded gravely

   descorts said i cant believe a marlin would come in
here in this close you must be wrong

   no sir said pop im right

a t the end of six days they knew every reef and every
nook and cranny on the bottom they even ventured
further east on a fine day by now they were into the
gasoline reserves they had brought and it was going to be
the last trip you cant fish a boat without gas they
would have to go back at least to eleuthera to replenish
the fuel

   this was the farthest east pop shannon had ever sailed
in the atlantic ocean and he found it very thrilling the
weather held fine and the barometer hung at thirty-one
inches without a flicker

   toward twilight on that evening as they purred slowly
along on the fading blue-green waters mike descorts
suddenly said i suppose well have to go back
yeah pop nodded gas getting low we could gas
up and make another try

 no no more now descorts said look pop the
weather is fine the sea is as placid as a pond whats
the depth here

   the chart says sixty feet or so pop replied were
still over the banks not very deep

   let go the anchor said descorts id like to spend
a night out here i want to talk to you and i want to
think a bit you dont get a chance to anchor a night far
off shore is that all right with you

  pop shannon scoured the sky and shrugged sure


argosy

he said all right with me nigger john you puller
outa gear and kill the motors and let go the big anchor
then well rustle some supper hear me

  yassuh said nigger john with dignity aye aye
capn

  they ate somewhat listlessly and as the night came
down the moon rose and the sea glowed and flashed in
the silvery reflection

  out in the cockpit while nigger john cleaned up the
galley pop shannon said you didnt have much appe-
tite mike

  no said descorts dully i didnt    pop im
tired of playing this game lets be honest shall we
at first back in laconia i thought you were on the level
about a marlin named baby face now i know better
pop said i do declare mike i dont know what
youre talkin about

  oh stow it pop i mean really know descorts said
somberly his dark eyes were on the sea and he acted
as if he were staring at something a million miles away
its all been a fake i know it now they told you i
guess i warned dr nichols not to say a word i see he
did what did he tell you pop

  he didnt tell me nothin pop said stubbornly

  to take me on a nice long trip said descorts sadly
to invent a marvelous fish whet my curiosity make me
interested in something besides the past

  i know youre lying pop and in a way i appreciate
what youve done because you did it out of friendship
and thats a nice thing but it was a little unfair im
sick ill admit it but even if we had found a marlin
named baby face that wouldnt have cured my troubles
nothing can change whats in my mind not a thing

  im sorry its that way but it is and theres nothing
you nor i nor any can do about it id have been pleased
to raise baby face but it wouldnt have changed an iota
of the little things in my head s

fop said mike youre all shot you aint the same
bright kid i useta know whats got into you
they did tell you descorts scowled down at his
knuckles the water slapped gently at the hull

  well yeah they told me i only did what they wanted
me to do i guess i bunged it all up but i was gonna
call the first decent marlin we raised baby face hard
luck we didnt raise one

  what did they tell you descorts said grimly the
knuckles were white now and sharp under the skin did
they tell you i tried to kill myself

  pop shannon gulped and tried to evade the question
but mike descorts shrugged and went on its true i
did i will again too and next time ill bring it off
my gawd pop shannon groaned thats a helluva
thing to say

  i wont do it here said descorts faintly i wouldnt
do a think like that to you pop while were at sea
mike listen you cant go doing a thing like that at
all youre young you got your whole dawgone life ahead
o you-

  i havent as much ahead of me as youd think des-
corts said - light your pipe pop id like to tell you
about it i havent told anyone completely not even that
old ass nichols id like to talk its better when a man
can talk

  talk away mike get it off your chest

  i was in love with her descorts said id never
been in love with anyone before her name was linda
she was beautiful she was everything i wanted and
she fell in love with me it was perfect one of those things
that can only happen once to a man if hes lucky it
happens once and then just like that she eloped with
one of my best friends he shuddered i suppose that
seems like an old story to you but it isnt to me i tied
my life up in that girl oh i fixed myself fine there
wasnt anything in the world for me but her and now
there isnt linda so there isnt anything at all

  well said pop there are plenty more fish in the
sea he knew when he said it that it didnt sound right
pop wasnt much of a one for words

  i cant see that i wish i could i went to pieces for
awhile and drank like a fish and then i began to get
around and i had a lot of nasty ideas i was going to
kill both of them-i still feel i could that id like to
a man hates giving up the thing he loves hed rather
scuttle it the way a captain scuttles his ship and then
go down with it himself

  mmm pop shannon said squinting at the far horizon
im all mixed up pop and the longer i go on being
mixed up the sooner ill do something ugly i cant sleep
when i do i dream rotten dreams i feel like doing rotten
things sometimes my head aches so hard that id put a
bullet in it if i had a gun handy at the time everything
is crowding in on me and its too much to handle im
dead tired im sick of it i dont want another chance
i just want peace im so damned tired    are you
listening

  yeah pop said im listening mike but theres
a kinda funny glow out there on the rim o the sea take
a look yourself

the dark sky was brightening where the sea met it
- far off pop rose hastily and went in and told nigger
john to hoist the anchor and start the engines

  then pop turned on the short-wave transmitter and
receiver and called the united states coast guard at
miami florida using the pretuned cg channel he
made a qso at once and said this is the striped marlin
about twenty miles due east of eleuthera reporting a ship
afire at sea due east of us maybe fifteen or twenty miles
he gave the approximate position

  the coast guard operator said thanks striped mar-
lin we already have an sos on her shes the german
liner bremborg trying a idash for home through the brit-
ish blockade a cruiser caught up with her an hour ago
and her captain and crew are burning her scuttling and
abandoning ship whats your length

  seventy feet

  youd do well to make for her and aid in the picking
up of survivors said the coast guard operator we
have two cutters on the way from positions some miles
north of her and a us destroyer the blue is also racing
to her youd be a help

  well turn the wheels toward her pop shannon said
thanks for the information old man

  s to you said the coast guard operator good
luck you can report back to me your identifications and
passengers sk

  pop closed down the transmitter and receiver and went
up the flying bridge where nigger john was warming the
engines mike descorts had gone up there too
bait for the big hook



  descorts said did you find out anything
uh-huh said pop funny we was just talkin about
ships and men and scuttlins thats whats happening
over there bremborg afire were goin to help

  he put his engines in gear and stepped up the rpm slow-
ly to the maximum and in two minutes the striped marlin
was racing across the placid moonlit sea toward the vor-
tex of orange on the horizon where a fine ship was going
to her end

for an hour after they arrived they overlooked the
confusion in the sea awed by the spectacle of seven
hundred feet of fiery furnace which floated off the bow
masterless the flames even climbing up the main mast
so that it looked like a frozen bolt of lightning

  there were corpses in the sea these the striped marlin
passed by weve only room for live ones pop ex-
plained when nigger john excitedly kept sighting the
bodies

  but they found living men too floating in the sea in
life-jackets calling for help agonized some burned some
half drowned

  they had six aboard when they sighted the lifeboat
by then the night had vanished in the brightness of the
floating fire and thesea around was brighter than day
and blood-red in the reflection of the towering flames

  southward pop and descorts could see the destroyer
playing its beam upon the waves and far to the north
there were other searchlights the coast guard cutters
were racing down still too far away to help

  the wallowing lifeboat they aimed for was only half-
filled and it carried a german flag in the stern when
they reached it pop heard a pistol crack and then a
wailing went up from the men in the boat

  descorts said with strange animation what hap-
pened

  dont know pop grunted well come in on them
and take them in tow and see whats what maybe youd
better get the rifle in case we have trouble with them
it isnt that said descorts something is wrong
with those men    there theres a man overboard
hes swimming away from the lifeboat-see over there-
about thirty feet away and going like a house afire he
must be an officer hes in uniform and hes got a re-
volver-see it in his hand as he swims

  yeah pop said he kinda looks like he dont want
to be saved we cant go for him if he dont want us
grab their painter in the lifeboat when we come along-
side

  but when they came alongside the men in the lifeboat
pushed them off and one seaman who spoke english
said nein nein dont save us we can float we will
wait the captain captain frey-he goes there we
tried to stop him but he shot at us-it is captain frey
and he is going to kill himself

  pop shouted there aint nothing we can do hes
got a gun he might plug us if we tried to pick him up
hell put a bullet in his head before we could hoist him 
nonsense descorts snapped suddenly its a sport-
ing chance weve got a chance to save his life pop
make for him but not too close watch him and watch
your trolling line im putting a hook out astern bring
my line right behind him when you pass and if i set it
get the rifle and shoot that revolver out of his hand you
can do it hurry the marlin rod is all rigged ill put

her over he started to work his face tense and eager

  pop glowed with terrible excitement and felt his heart
banging against his ribs as though it were a hammer

  he stepped the cruiser away from the lifeboat at full
speed as descorts thrust the big marlin rod in the gimbal
of the fishing chair astern tossed the twelve-ought hook
and rig overboard and free-spooled the big reel allowing
the rig to drop astern of them

  pop shouted youll never do it mike youll never
do it you cant catch a man-

  watch your fish and watch your line descorts
snapped weve raised the biggest game in the world
pop and weve got to do it there he is

pop sent the striped marlin past the swimming man
but fifteen feet off his right side then having passed
he cut the boat in directly ahead of captain frey

  the stern wave nearly swamped the swimming man and
he stopped breathlessly he had swum far afraid of pur-
suit and now he raised his head to see if he were far
enough off

  ahead of him he saw the laconia cruiser beating away
from him making no attempt to stop him and pick him up

  descorts closed the free pool and tightened the star
drag he watched his line cut in behind the struggling
captain as pop maneuvered the boat with that wonderful
dexterity which distinguishes a fisherman from an ordi-
nary yachtsman

  the captain in the sea had a terrible face as he looked
for what he thought was the last time at the burning
hulk upon the sea then quickly he raised the revolver
to his temple and fired

  he missed

  the hook came in behind him and caught him in the
shoulders mike descorts felt the tension on the line in-
stantly and he yelled at pop to stand by

  with all his strength and with the drag much tighter
descorts leaned back in the chair and set the big hook with
three stiff jolts he set it as captain frey fired natur-
ally the captain missed the pain of the hook jerked his
arm away and they could hear him yell

  pop leaped from the bridge turning it over to nigger
john who knew what to do when there was a fish on this
time there wasa man on however and nigger johns eyes
were big as buttons and he looked scared

  pop got the high-powered twenty-two from the cabin
and loaded it and ran astern the hand with the gun came
up from the sea aimed at them poorly made a perfect
target of itself pop fired sent a bullet smacking through
the hand and the gun disappeared

  captain frey turned and tried to swim away he was
far off their stern now for the rush of the cruiser had
carried her away from him

  all right pop breathed with some relief hes your
fish mike land him

  mike descorts bent to the task the big marlin rod was
bent war over its tip almost pointing to the sea instead
of the sky it was tough hickory but captain frey was
a big man and now and then he would wheel and grab the
leader and yank savagely trying to break the line or the
rod and the strain would be terrific

  the captain would try hard in these jerks to ease the
pull of the hook in his left shoulder

  but always when he tried to swim away the weight
of the hook would be there pulling against him and he


argosy

could feel the inexorable strength of descorts against
him as descorts slowly pulled back raising the tip of
the rod and letting it jerk forward as he reeled in line

  pop said hes got a pocketknife tight lines mike

  descorts grunted he wont-cut this-line pop
theres fifteen feet-of steel wire leader before he-gets
to the line-and ill keep it out-of his-reach

  he did putting on the pressure holding up the rod
without attempting to gain line or allowing any slack
it was too much for frey to bear finally for he turned
again panicked and tried to swim away

  he lost ground at once descorts tightened the drag
further and started the rhythmic motion of raising and
lowering the rod bringing the dripping wet line in around
the spool hauling the struggling man closer to the boat

  frey put tremendous power into the battle considering
he was wounded and hooked he fought with all the bull-
doggedness of a tuna now and then with the surge of a
marlin as he floundered up and tried to dive forward out
of the water and break the line

  but descorts felt these things in the tension of his line
and was prepared for them he loosened the drag when
frey surged tightened it after the surge and hauled frey
back over more ground than he had gained when frey
tried to put his head down and sulk as tuna do descorts
brought him up with short hard jerks

ttrey knew he was losing finally and tried to go the
hard way he let himself become a dead weight and
he sank inhaling sea water he was trying to drown

  mike descorts raised a hand at pop who had climbed
back onto the bridge and the cruiser reversed sharply as
descorts worked like a trojan on the rod lifting and drop-
ping it the sweat standing out on his face like water

  frey came to the surface again held up by the raising
of the rod tip it was the end the wire leader had banged
the tip of the rod and the game was over

  descorts could do no more the striped marlin was
alongside the half-drowned captain and pop was stand-
ing in the stern with a boat hook in his hand

  gaff him descorts said quietly

  pop leaned over hooked the captain by the collar of his
jacket and raised up nigger john helped

  their fish lay unmoving on the floor of the cockpit

     the ocean was dark again when they set their
course westward for florida with a boatful of german

seaman all grateful at having been picked up in the for-
ward cabin descorts was working on captain frey he
came out finally and told nigger john to take over and
watch the man until he came to

  hes going to be all right pop mike descorts said
we really saved that bird he opened his eyes once when
i was cutting the hook out of him it caught him in the
shoulder muscle you know and i had a job getting it out
i guess ithurt him into consciousness he knew what i
was doing and he said no-no but i told him to take
it easy and keep warm and lie still i told him the war
wouldnt last forever and that there were always other
good boats for a man to captain plenty of boats on the
ocean all beautiful and that he should never put his
whole life into one i think maybe i got across to him

  pop breathed gently devouring the beautiful night sky
with his sage old eyes yeah mike he murmured lots
of boats on the ocean for a man to captain and lots of
fish in the sea for a man to-

  descorts smiled faintly you dont have to hint any
more pop he said i know what you mean when the
war is over when the cobwebs clean up a man shouldnt
put his whole life into a ship any more than into a wom-
an i couldnt tell him without telling myself

  there was a long silence then pop said purty night
  uh-huh

  that was nice fishin you did on him mike

  it wasnt bad was it descorts said i thought my
line was going to snap it was never built for that strain he
gave it my heart was in my mouth

  listen pop said maybe i was lyin about baby face
but did you ever hear of the big bill

  sure ive heard of big bill said mike descorts his
eyes blazing hes the biggest old sailfish in the world
got more hooks in his mouth and scars on his body than
any fish-pop you dont mean-

  i was clearin the breakwater at laconia tother day
pop whispered and ill swear and declare he all but
rammed the bow of my boat no moren half a mile off the
stones i was keepin it a strict secret on account of he
aint been raised in four months but if youre interested-
big bill breathed mike descorts on a six-ounce
rod with nine-thread line would be a little bit of heaven
wouldnt he

  aye said pop watching the stars a little bit in-
deed

 a true story in pictures
 long road to tomorrow



by arthur leo zagat

slowly americas army of freedom led by norman-
fenton has grown stronger and now the army has
marched to the foot of the great smokies where nor-
manfenton hopes to surprise and vanquish yee hasha-
motos asafric troops but this scheme is frustrated in
fact only the skill and daring of dikar and his bunch
saves the americans from complete destruction

  having intercepted yee hashamotos messages gen-
eral normanfenton knows what the asafrics are plan-
ning three divisions of their troops are stationed at
the panama canal and yee hashamoto has determined
to bring them up through central america they will
give him sufficient new strength to crush the rebelling
americans so the asafric divisions must be stopped
and normanfenton summons dikar

the task for dikar is an incredibly difficult and peril-
ous one years before many americans sought refuge
in the jungles of yucatan and there they are still living
as fas as anyone knows they are isolated virtually

unreachable presidenton normanfenton asks dikar to
penetrate the yucatan jungle find these vanished
americans and rouse them to attack the approaching
asafric divisions dikar must go secretly and alone
without the knowledge or aid of the bunch willingly
he agrees to set out on this wild venture

  while dikar and normanfenton are talking someone
creeps up to the window the spy escapes from dikar
unidentified and no trace is found of him but all he
has overheard is that dikar is being sent on some
secret mission

tilkar has promised not even to tell marilee about his
task and so he leaves when she is asleep sorrowing
because he may not live to see her again according to
plan he conceals himself in a truck belonging to a con-
voy which is led by walt bennet

  after a time walt manages it so that dikars truck is
left behind by the rest of the convoy dressed now in
the uniform of an asafric dikar prepares to follow the



this story began in the argosy for march 
long road to tomorrow



mississippi river-down toward his jungle destination
the truck he rode has been set on fire then suddenly
a wild form leaps at him knife gleaming and before
dikar can lift his revolver he is seized from behind 

       chapter x	

                 the night knife

jerked off-balance dikar went down into the wel-
ter of burned junk the knife missed him clean as
the first asafric lurched past and vanished in a crash
of charred wood but the other one hung on falling on
top of him

  for moments they struggled silently their breath harsh
and broken but all dikars great strength could not throw
off the heavy powerful body of the asafric dikar was
pinned down writhing and now he felt a hand slide to
his throat and tighten there frantically he twisted but
the hand clenched tighter and his strength was ebbing fast

  then dikar felt the asafrics body jerk spasmodically
the next instant it had gone lax with a last effort dikar
heaved it from him and he struggled to his feet gasping

  he swayed there-staring into the frightened white face
of marilee her hand still held a bloody knife

 marilee how-

  with a little sob she dropped the knife and ran to him
first i thought you were an asafric she whispered
against his chest then i saw your eyes and i knew
and then i-i killed him

  he held her fiercely but hqwd you get here mari-
lee

  on top of the truck you were in

  on top- dikar remembered the bump on the roof
you followed me- suddenly he thrust her from him
and down so that she was crouched on the ground stay
down marilee the other one is hidin over there

  the flames from the burning truck were dying now and
all around him the weird shadows were moving like naked
blacks creeping from every side why ciid you follow
me marilee

  because you were misrable an i had to know why

  i was what

  heartsick dikar ive lived with you too long not to
read it on your face when you came back from head-
quarters all through supper i knew it an after in our
cabin i waited for you to tell me about it but you didnt

  oh dikar a sob caught in marilees throat and
dikars-arms ached with wanting to take her in them again
and comfort her youd shut me away from you there
was something between us cold an dark an-an terrible
he didnt dare even look at her if he took his eyes off
the shadows that would be the killers chance to jump
them

  i knew you werent asleep marilee went on i knew
you were only waitin for me to fall asleep so that you
could do somethin you diclnt want me to know about
somethin that made you sick even to think about doin
i had to know what it was i just had to so i made
believe to fall asleep-

  you fooled me all right

  then you got up and started down the hill an i trailed
you in the treetops keeping far behind by the sounds
you made that wasnt like you dikar to make any
sounds at all goin through the woods an it made me
even more worried then you crossed a clearin an i saw

you you were-funny like you were walkin in your
sleep

   thats the way i felt marilee the truck was almost
 burnt out pretty soon it would be black dark like i
 was walkin in a nightmare

 rphis was like a nightmare too the black ruins all about
 - the dying firelight the shivery feel of death waiting
 somewhere in the deepening shadows no sound hut
 marilees low words

   while you crouched there at the side of the road i
 watched you from a treetop down near the last truck
 when the trucks started movin i saw you jump on the
 back of the last one an climb in and then dikar i saw
 another dark figure dart out of the woods jump on the
 back of that same truck and hang there 

   hang on the chain thats why it stopped clankin
 someone else trailed me-the spy of course the spy that
 got away this afternoon

   the trucks had gone around a curve so there was no
 use my yellin but i cut across still in the treetops to
 where the road curves around the hill got there in time
 i to drop down on top of the one you were in

   i thought that was a low branch hittin the roof

   i was just goin to yell down to its drivers when i re-
 membered that the spy would hear me an get away so
 i just stayed up there-

   an rode like that all night oh marilee suppose
 youd fallen off

   i almost did she said simply lots of times it was
 slippery up there an the cold wind pulled at me well
 anyways when the truck stopped the spy dropped off an
 dived in amqng those burned buildins here so fast that
 all i could see was a flittin shadow then walt was down
 there under me

   while he was talkin to the soldiers i let myself down
 on the other side of the truck and crawled along in a ditch
 a ways an then went across the road fast to the side
 where the spy was

   why in thunder did you do that

   i wanted to see who the spy was

   what for the last light flickered out and the dread-
 ful dark closed in what difference does it make who
 he is dikars body hummed like a stretched bowstring

   what difference look dikar hed trailed you
 through the woods without either you or me hearin him
 who else could have done that except-v

   no dikar groaned her meaning terribly clear to him
 it couldnt be a-

   look out marilee half-screamed behind dikar
 whirled to a sudden black shape his gun whipping up

   dont shoot the shape said quietlydont shoot
 me dikar

   bessalton marilee exclaimed its bessalton dikar
 not the spy

 yes marilee bessaltons voice was flat and tired

      the spy i swam to the headquarters wall from
 where the bunch was in swimmin an i swam back to
 you under water when i fell from the wall an nobody
 noticed that i hadnt been with you all the time

   you were the spy- why bessalton marilee was
 standing now why did you spy on dikar an follow
 him

   thats clear enough dikar said grimly she fig-


argosy

 ures that we killed franksmith so shes turned mudskin
 to get even

  mudskin me how can you say such a thing
bessalton blazed back

  i can say it all right dikars throat was tight with
his anger because it is so why else did you spy on us
i had to dikar i had to find out what norman-
fenton wanted id sent franksmith to die on clingmans
dome an the others whore buried up there an now
there were only nine of you boys left i wasnt goin to
let normanfenton send you to die too i was goin to
stop him somehow

  an then i saw normanfentons face as he said america
is in danger an i heard his voice as he told you that you
were the only one who could save america an i knew
that i couldnt stop you from goin where he was sendin
you but i could go along without your knowin it an
maybe i could save you from gettin killed-

  get killed yourself is more like it

  maybe get killed myself ibessalton agreed an go
to franksmith hes waitin for me dikar somewhere
out there in the dark ive heard him callin me all
of a sudden her low voice was edged by a strange spine-
chilling shrillness every night i hear him callin
me-

  thats crazy dikar exclaimed hes dead bessal-
ton an-

  no dikar marilee broke in its not crazy id
feel the same way if you went away from me an never came
back id hear your voice callin me

  when a girl gives a boy her love there is no life for
her any more except as part of his life if he shuts her out
from it he kills her just as sure as if he stuck a knife in
her heart only more cruelly

  that was what dikar was doing he was shutting
marilee out from his life-she knew it that was why
she had said this wait he had to gain time to think
this out bessalton did you see the asafric that jumped
at me with the knife whered he go

  i tried to follow him dikar soon as i knew you
werent an asafric but i couldnt find him she
shivered i was goin to try to kill him

  dikar marilee said why are you dressed up like
an asafric what are you goin to do

  he stared at her feeling a sudden new anguish here
it was the question hed sneaked out of the cabin to
keep from having her ask i cant tell you marilee
he said at length that was the answer shed just told
him would be like his sticking a knife into her nor-
manfenton ordered me not to an normanfentons our
boss an ive got to obey him

  you-cant-tell-me dikar strained to see marj-
lees face in the dark but all he could see was that she
stood straight in the dimness what right has nortnan-
fenton to order you to shut me out from you

  every right he answered miserably his plan
to checkmate hashamotos move to smash our whole
cause wont work if a hint of it leaks out oh marilee
im sorry im dreadful sorry but i cant tell anyone
not even you-

  you are mistaken a soft lisping voice said behind
dikar dont move all of a sudden black burly
shapes blotted the darkness behind the girls and lifted
knives struck blue sparks out of the darkness if you
move american your women die

chapter xi

down the dark river

rphe river was a dark rush through the night and dikar
was being carried along on the breast of its black
flood his ankles were tied his wrists tied behind his
back so tight that his brow was wet with sweat and he
could barely hear the soft silken murmur of the question
that was being asked him for the twentieth time

  what is fentons plan

  the asafrics had tied up marilee and bessalton and
laid them in the bottom of the little boat but theyd
made dikar sit between them so that the officer could
ask him again and again

  what is fentons plan american

  dikar kept his lips tight shut but his eyes looked
hate at the man who faced him from the board across
the middle of the boat under which the girls legs had
been shoved

  you are not very wise murmured lieutenant yo-
suke to be so stubborn dikar knew his name be-
cause one of the blacks had called him that while they
were taking their prisoners down to the ruined pier under
which theyd hidden this boat

  if i can report to my commander that i have obtained
the whole story i shall win a promotion for that he
lifted the gun he held in his lap i am willing to pay
you with the mercy of a clean death

  the sky was faintly paling with the false dawn and
against it in the very front of the boat dikar could see the
crouched motionless bulk of a black who silently
watched the dark bank the skys grayness lay on the
water out further but the other black bent over an
oar in the back of the boat kept it in the shadow of
the bank

  what is fentons plan american j
yosuke had told dikar that the glare of flames from
the truck had been seen by the asafrics as they returned
from a scout further up the river theyd come in to
shore and two men had been sent to investigate one
of them had returned to report to yosuke after discover-
ing that dikar was not alone

  you would be very wise yosukes silken patient
voice murmured to tell fentons plan to me now if
you wait till we get to memphis you will beg to tell
it to anyone who will listen

  dikar said slowly nothing you can do will make
me talk

  no yosuke sighed i imagine not nothing we
can do to you-you americans are very stubborn about
such things as duty and honor that is why i have
burdened myself with these two women instead of having
them killed back there

  dikar felt the muscles knot along the edge of his
jaw what do you mean he asked hoarsely

  yosuke smiled the blacks he said the blacks
will have charge of the women you would not like that
you dog dikar spat at him you filthy yellow
dog

  you dare to call me- yosuke lashed out to slice
the sight of his gun across dikars face dikars right
hand flashed from behind his back grabbed the revol-
ver his left fist cracked against the yellow officers jaw
yosuke sagged down
long road to tomorrow	

  lifting yosukes gun dikar pounded bullets into the
asafric up front pounded him over into the river dikar
laughed triumphantly twisted to the man behind him
the black had dropped his oar and was snatching up a
rifle his tied legs cramped between the girls dikar
couldnt get his arm around far enough to aim at the
black

   the rifle swept up to point straight at his head shat-
tered the silence with its roar the darkness with its light-
ning but in that split-second dikar had thrown himself
sideways over the boats side and he was going down into
the lightless rush of the river

tts cold struck into him like a thousand knives numbed
him the weight of the water in his clothes dragged
him down into the black depths he could not kick
free from the bonds on his ankles no matter how fran-
tically he struggled he was sinking-drowning

  held air tore at dikars lungs his mind was blurred
now his feet struck the rivers bed and kicked and
he was going up again

  his head broke water breath burst from him in a
great gasp a scream drew his gaze to the boat beyond
reach and he saw the black gigantic standing rifle
lifted butt down to smash it where the girls heads
must be

  dikar brought knees up into his belly straightened
them with a frantic strength that shot him half out of
water and to the boat his hands clamped on the asa-
frics straddled legs his shoulders heaved a flailing
dark form sailed over his head sent up a tremendous
splash

  the splash blinded dikar and then cleared away a
black log came up in the whitish foam-boil rolled and
was moving shoreward it was the black if he got
to land hed spread the alarm and dikars journey would
be ended before it had hardly started

  dikar couldnt stop hinif hed lost his gun and he
didnt dare let go the boat suddenly something struck
him-the oar he grabbed it pointed its handle end at
the swimming asafric threw it with all the power he could

   not for nothing had he killed deer with spears on the
mountain the -heavy oar flew straight to its mark
there was a crack a flurry of arms and legs and foam

  there was nothing but foam out there on the top of
the rushing waters foam and the bobbing oar

  the boat rocked with someone moving inside who
the scream hed heard had been bessaltons had the
black smashed his rifle-butt down once already was
marilee- her name burst from dikar in a great sob as
he twisted got his other hand on the boats edge fought
to pull himself up marilee

  dikar

  he could breathe again as he looked down and saw
two pale ovals in the black bottom of the boat dikar
marilee gasped are you all right

  fine he ached all over would have to rest before
he could drag himself up and over but he wasnt lying
im fine an that black wont bother us any more he
strained to see what was in the middle of the boat how
about the lieutnant

  he hasnt stirred since you hit him oh dikar
that was wonderful the way you called him a name to
bring him close enough for you to get at him

  what was wonderful was the way you gnawed through

my cords behind my back how did you ever think
of that

  how could i help thinkin of it with your hands right
down on my chin but i had to scrouge down to get
my teeth to them an if yosuke had noticed-

  he was too busy with me to notice anything what
had me shivering though was the fellow right back
of you if hed seen-

  he couldnt it was so dark down here i couldnt see
your wrists myself just felt them i guess you can make
me out now because the sky is getting lighter it must
be near sunrise

  i guess- dikar looking up checked that isnt
sunrise marilee the dim glow that had come into
the sky had a reddish scary shade the sun doesnt
come up in-the south

  what then marilee was startled a fire

  no its the lights of memphis we must be gettin
close well be seen as soon as the river carries us past
that point of land ive got to stop this boat

  how

  if i hold on an kick maybe i can swing it in enough
to hit the point instead of passin it like this  

rphe thicket of bushes and weeds and tall grass was
still more gray than green in the clouded dawn as
dikar lifted from making sure that lieutenant yosuke
had not loosened the vines with which he was tied up
or worked the gag of leaves out of his mouth

  marilee and bessalton pushed through the screen
of leaves from beyond which there came the rushing sound
of the river waters all right dikar asked low-toned

  all right marilee answered we found where a
willow makes a curtain of its branches dipping down
into the water and hid the boat behind it what did
you find out on your scout

  theres a road back there dikar pointed but
from the looks of things no one ever stops here there
was no need for him to tell about the bunch of ivy hed
seen swaying from a tall pole beside the road a yellow
skull grinning out at him from its heart this ground
around here was once cleared but its all overgrown like
this deserted and desolate down the road alittle is a big
house but no sign that anyones lived in it for years we
seem to be pretty safe here till were ready to leave
thats good we all need rest marilees eyes went
to yosuke one of us will have to keep watchin him
though dikar

  why bessalton was looking at the asafric officer
too her nostrils pinched queer whitish lines around her
mouth her fingers touching the hilt of the knife she car-
ried in a fold of her sarong

  why cant we do what he would just slice his throat
an be done with him if hed died like his two men died
you wouldnt be worryin about him would you

   if hed died in fair fight dikar explained it would
have been fine but we cant just kill him when he hasnt
a chance to defend himself

  why bessalton asked again

   because we cant its the code dikar made a little
brushing motion with his hand never mind ill fig-
ure out later what to do with him what weve got to
figure out now is how you girls are goin to get back to
norrisdam

  wrong marilee said we havent got to figure that


argosy

out because bessalton and i have decided were not
goin back were goin with you

vrou decided dikar didnt know whether to laugh
or be mad i suppose the presidents orders that

i	am to go alone have nothin to do with it

  they have not she snapped back normanfenton
may be president an the smartest man in america but
hes not a-an angel he can make mistakes and this
is one time hes made one suppose youd been alone
last night dikar where would you be now

  dikar knew it was no use arguing with her hed learned
long ago that when marilee said something with her little
chin stuck out like that and her small fists curled at her
sides you couldnt change her but hed never learned not
to try

  look honey i- he couldnt just lay down the
law to her he couldnt send her away without her un-
derstanding why look lets go off where that asa-
fric cant hear an ill explain why i cant take you with
me he put his hand on her arm and they moved off
and only afterward dikar realized that theyd forgotten
all about bessalton

  leaves rustled against them thorns plucked at them
marilee stopped this is far enough dikar go ahead
you mustnt repeat a word of this even in your
sleep

  do you have to tell me that

  no well marilee heres the story he told her
about it in as few words as he could so you see he
ended why normanfenton said that i must go alone
yes i see why he said it an i still think he is wrong
look dikar if you go alone an youre captured or
killed thats the end of everything but if the three of
us try to get through to this yucatan theres three
chances of one of us gettin there the chances might be
more against each one of the three but the chances
against america would be less

  dikar rubbed the back of his head with his knuckles
i-i guess im dumb when i listened to norman-
fenton he seemed right now you seem right but you
cant both be

  no we cant both be she moved a little away
its up to you dikar her gray eyes took hold of
his its all up to you

  up to me if i say so youll stop arguin an go back
to norrisdam

  if you say that you must go alone i will not try
to go with you

  she always twisted his words around the light wind
that stirred the leaves was suddenly cold on dikars skin
marilee stood straight and proud in the dimness and
something in the way her eyes rested on him reminded
dikar of what shed said last night when a girl gives
a boy her love-there is no life for her any more except
as a part of his life

  a bird cheeped its joy at finding a worm underlying
the tiny morning sounds in the brush was the sound of the
wide river rushing endlessly to the gulf

  dikar couldnt think with marilees eyes on him he
looked away from marilee through an opening in the
shimmering green he saw a piece of the river he saw a
broken plank caught in the grasp of the swift current
shoot across the space of muddy water and vanish
downstream

ttelp me marilee dikar murmured youve
always helped me to find the right thing to do
he looked at marilee her hand was pressed against
her breast as if something hurt her help me this
once more

  no the hand pressed harder against the soft round
of her breast this is a thing i cannot help you with it
is a thing for you to decide yourself

  dikar couldnt bear looking at that hand knowing that
the hurt under it was on account of him he looked at
the river again two branches held together by their
intertwined twigs came into view a swirl of the cur-
rent brought them to the inner edge of the water some-
thing on the shore caught one of them held it the cur-
rent tore the other one away slanted it out toward the
middle of the river the twisted little twigs of the one
left behind quivered as if reaching after the branch that
had come so far with it

  there was no use of it reaching the river had sepa-
rated them the river would never let them come
together again anything caught in the rush of the river
must obey the will of the river

  no marilee dikar said still not looking at her it
is nothing for me to decide it is something that has
been decided for me i have my orders an-wait

  out there in the river something black small had ap-
peared a muskrats head a long v-shaped ripple
trailed behind it and the v slanted toward the shore
across the streaks of foam that marked the current that
had swept the branch out away from it

  the strength of the muskrat was so small so awfully
small against the strength of the river but the muskrat
wanted to get to shore and it was setting its will against
the will of the river

  a spray of leaves hid it from dikar but it was much
nearer the shore than when hed first glimpsed it he
swung around to marilee and his words came swiftly
what i have to do ive got to do he cried but im
a man not a stick of wood so ill do it my own way
youre goin with me my marilee

  dikar a light that had almost gone out flared
again and shone brilliant in the gray eyes oh dikar-
a loud threshing of brush broke in on her the pound
of running feet dikar whirled threw himself toward
it something thudded to the ground just beyond a bush
that blocked his view he got around the bush and
stopped his eyes widening

  bessalton stood rigid the blade of the knife in her hand
scarlet looking down at yosuke who sprawled at her feet
face down and very still

jtarilee came up gasped stopped close to dikar
-l bessaltons head turned to them he must have
rubbed the vines around his feet against a stone she
said till he rubbed them through first thing i knew
hed jumped up an started to run i caught up with him
and-and-well there wasnt anything else i could do
was there

  no marilee saiijflat-toned i guess not dikar
was looking at the flattened-down grass where yosuke
had lain he could see the vines that had been around
his ankles and even from here he could see thcjt their
ends were not frayed but sliced through clean

  no bessalton marilee murmured i guess there
was nothing else you could do
long road to tomorrow



  thats what franksmith told me said bessalton

  marilee caught and clung to dikars hand and he felt
a shudder run through him

  franksmith bessalton said again her forehead
wrinkled and her eyes were suddenly puzzled but-
but franksmith is dead he is dead an buried up there
on clingmans dome how could he tell me anything

  marilees breath hissed she let go of dikar held her
hand out to bessalton give me the knife dear she said
very gently please give it to me

  looking at her bessalton was very white and dikar
could see that a sob was tearing at her throat she shook
like an aspen leaf in the falls first chill breeze marilee
took the knife from bessaltons fingers and gave it to
dikar and put her arm around the black-haired girls
waist come dear she said softly come with me
she turned bessalton away from the still form on the
ground led her off bushes parted closed behind them

  dikar stared where they had gone his throat dry this
was a mess they couldnt take bessalton along with
them that was certain but they couldnt send her back
alone either maybe marilee could help him figure out
what to do meantime hed better wipe the blood off
this knife

  he bent and stuck it deep in the ground and when
he pulled it out it was clean again then to keep him-
self from thinking about bessalton he cut branches
from the bushes piled them over the asafric just as
he finished marilee came back to him

  she cried herself to sleep she answered his silent
question

  weve got to get rid of her marilee somehow some
night shes liable to hear franksmith tell her to kill you
or me-

  no dikar shell never again hear franksmith talkin
to her

  how do you know

  i dont know how i know but im sure of it as i am
that you love me somethin happened to bessalton when
she killed yosuke somethin that shook her up so that-
listen marilees pupils got big all of a sudden black
and frightened whats that sound

  dikar heard it too-a blurring rumble somewhere in-
land sounds like a trucks runnin along that road
they listened and the rumble got closer louder itll go
by marilee

  but it didnt it was slowing it stopped a door
slammed and bushes threshed as men pushed into them
theyve found us marilee whispered dikar theyve
found out were here an theyve come for us

chapter xii

surrender american

theyve got us cut off dikar declared low-toned

   we cant get past em were trapped on this
point

 the river marilee whispered the boats-

  our only chance come on

  they flitted through the thicket marilee left dikar
for an instant and came back with bessalton whose face
was muzzy with sleep dikar handed the black-haired
gm her knife glanced at marilee to make sure she had
hers and his own these knives were all they had to

fight with if they had to fight there was nothing else

  the blacks rifles and yosukes revolver were at the
bottom of the river dikars own gun must be too he
hadnt been able to find it

  he let marilee get a little ahead so that she could
lead the way to where shed hidden the boat the first
loud threshing back of them had stopped dikar could
hardly hear the asafrics at all that was bad it meant
that they must be black trailers whose woodcraft nearly
matched that of the bunch

  marilee stopped suddenly very carefully let a branch
that shed pulled aside drop back into place she turned
and her face was drawn pallid	

  no use she breathed theres a couple of little
boats out there on the river filled with soldiers

  theyve outguessed us

  no theyre only fishing but theyre right opposite
the willow her brow wrinkled listen those others
arent comin down here after us they seem to have
stopped movin

  dikar cocked his head listened does sound like
that im goin to see what- he darted away slipping
through the thorny tangle with those clothes on he
couldnt move as noiselessly as hed liked but the wind
in the leaves made a louder rustle than he did

  the wind brought him the smell of asafric blacks
that scent swerved him toward where hed seen the old
house he froze as a yell high-pitched like the voices of
all the yellow officers pierced the rustling hush

  come out of there it was around on the other side
of where dikar knew the old house stood you are sur-
rounded

  surround and be damned wall-muffled that was a
ringing and defiant shout and the voice was that of an
american if you want me come and take me

  instinct rather than anything hed heard made dikar
turn his head the girls had followed him if we have
to take you the asafric was answering the american
youll be sorry you ever was born youd better come out
unarmed

  dikar jerked his hand to the girls to go back wait
for me the american shouted ill be out with the first
snowfall marilee crept closer to dikar can we help
him dikar

  ill see if theres a chance you two stay-here he
was moving again around to the other side of the house-
from where the asafric was yelling i shall give you five
minutes to come out maybe hed lied about the house
being surrounded five minutes american and then
we come in after you

  a laugh hoarse mocking was the only answer

tilkar went rigid his nostrils flaring just ahead of
 him a dark bulk crouched in the greenery a long
thin rifle barrel jutting sideways out from it somewhat
beyond there was another black

  five minutes american counting from now

  through shimmering green dikar could make out the
house its walls silvery-gray except where some flecks
of paint still stuck to them the windows glassless black
and empty-looking the roof squashed as if a giants foot
had stepped on it

  around the house was a space twenty feet or so wide
where only grass and weeds grew but no bushes no one
could cross that without making himself a plain target


argosy

for the american inside and the american seemed ready

  that was why the asafric officer was trying to get him
to come out and that was why he had been silent since
his last brave laugh he couldnt watch all around the
house at once but if he kept quiet there was no telling
where he was he could surely kill two or three blacks
before they got him their officer was smart to try and
save them if he could

  the one nearest dikar had eyes for the house only a
fellow could sneak up    dikar shook his head telling
himself he had no right to he had no right to risk the
fate of all americans to save one

  the black was moving he took his hat off put it
on the end of his rifle stuck it out of the bushes just a
little so it looked like he was putting his head out care-
lessly

  no shot came from the house the american wasnt
watching this side

  four minutes more the yell came from the other
side of the house you have four minutes to think it
over

  leaves rustled the asafric dikar watched was lifting
from his crouch the other one did the same half-bent
rifles slanted across in front of their burly forms they
were prowling towards the house

  they werent going to wait for the five minutes to be up

dikar felt a blinding surge of anger next thing he
knew he was out in the open and his knife was flash-
ing had buried itself in the back of the nearest black

  he pulled it out twisted to the other saw white
goggling eyes thick purplish lips opening before the
slow-thinking asafric could quite realize that this dark
man in green was an enemy dikar had leaped at him
had sliced his throat

  the green-uniformed body thudded to the ground and
dikar was back in the bushes three minutes he heard
the officer yell only three minutes more and then
dikar saw marilees white big-eyed face bessaltons

  were in for it now he snapped at them when
the rest find those bodies    you two go around that
way he pointed take care of any blacks you find
there ill take the other two sides

  they nodded were off dikar was a silent shadow now
in spite of his clothes flitting through the tangle he
spotted a black and dropped to his belly slithered up on
him like a snake struck like a snake

  dikars next victim saw him his scream was in his
eyes as he died

  one minute the officer flat under a bush was the
only one around in front of the house one minute
american and we close in on you he was little wiry
watch in one hand revolver in the other he was looking at
the closed door of the house at the broken steps leading
down from it you cannot escape there was no sound
from inside the house give up americ-

  the officers back wasnt as tough to dikars knife as
the muscled backs of the blacks

dikar felt like he was going to be sick to the stomach
but the girls eyes were shining in their pale faces
i know marilee said seeing what he looked like i
know what youre thinkin it didnt seem like fair fight
but it was

  we werent up against only the seven asafrics here

our knives against their guns if wed given one of them a
chance to even yell or shoot the ones out there on the
river would have heard the fightin an come to see what
was up we are up against the whole asafric army just
the three of us an any way that we can find to even the
odds is fair

  we boys live by a code dikar thought as he lifted to
his feet but girls cut straight through codes when they
have to well have to get away from here quick now
before others come to see what happened to this detach-
ment

  how about the american in there

  ill go tell him hes safe dikar started toward the
house

  a gun cracked inside of it and something plucked at
dikars sleeve as he jumped back into the thicket a great
ringing laugh followed him

  come on  the laugh broke into shouted words why
dont you come on i cant kill all of you come on an
take me

  he saw your green uniform marilee exclaimed he
thinks youre an asafric but we dont dare yell to him
those soldiers on the river    bessalton  she grabbed
at the other girl but was too late bessalton was out
there in the open walking straight toward the house an
odd little smile touching the corners of her mouth

  oh gosh dikar groaned shes gone nuts again

  no she hasnt marilee was smiling too he can
see that shes white oh look at her dikar

  the black hair rippled down around the slender grace-
ful figure bare-legged bare-armed the white sarong out-
lining every lovely curve bessaltons head was high and
proud as she walked in the sun

  the doors opening marilee whispered

  bessalton reached the steps and the door up top of them
came wideband a lean long-legged man was framed in
the opening he stared at bessalton

  i didnt feel the bullet dikar could hear him
plainly

  the bullet bessalton sounded puzzled looking up
at the man his hands were tight on the rifle he held
across in front of a faded-blue shirt open at the throat
and almost as ragged as the dirt-colored pants fastened
around his waist by a belt of rope his jaw was black
with beard-stubble his cheeks sunken his eyes like
burned-out coals

  what bullet bessalton asked

  the one that killed me im dead aint i he
chuckled and there was something suddenly gay in the
sound of it something heartwarming i must be you
couldnt be anyone but an angel come to take me to
heaven

  bessaltons laugh was startling oh dikar marilee
breathed she hasnt laughed since franksmith died

chapter xiii

south to peril

rphe gaunt young man closed the door after hed let
them into the house but there was still enough light
to see that there was dust everywhere in the desolate
empty rooms to see that the slats where the plaster had
fallen out of the walls like a grid of fishbones

  yeah he chuckled its an awful dump but it sure


long road to tomorrow

 

looks good to jim corbin he was grinning but his
eyes watched dikar warily and he held his rifle ready
to shoot all-fired good considering that a couple min-
utes ago i thought i wouldnt be looking at anything by
this time

  you dont have to keep your finger curled on your
gun trigger marilee smiled were friends hnest
we are

  you seem to have proved that all right he backed
up against the wall beside the door and the way he stood
on one leg the other a little lifted he reminded dikar of a
fawn hed cornered once on the mountain intending to
catch and tame it for a pet for marilee but i dont get
it i dont get it at all why should an asafric-

  im not an asafric jim corbin dikar grinned im
as good an american as you are my names dikar
dikar the hell you are jim corbins gun-muzzle
swung around to bear on dikars chest ive heard all
about dikar hes got golden hair and yours is black
and- what kind of stunt are you trying to pull on
me anyway

  no stunt cross my heart an hope- wait dikar
thought of something i know why youre hidin here
inside the enemy lines youre an agent of the secret
net

  so what thats no secret any more judging from
the visitors i was entertaining a little while ago i belong
to the secret net and my calls v-four and where does
that bring us

  to where i can prove im no asafric dikar smiled
listen johndawson-he was v-six when i first found
him in the far land-once told me that theres a question
you of the net ask to test if a station has been captured
an is bein operated by a spy that right

  right enough what about it

  if you ask it ill give you the answer

  you will hey jimcorbin looked uncertain well-
how many feathers in the eagles tail

  thirteen an the risin sun may have scorched his
wings but hell fly again into the red-striped mornin up
an up till the white stars blaze in the blue sky is that
right jimcorbin

  right as rain the other said and if you know that
youre no asafric shake dikar he shifted his rifle
to his left hand and stuck out his right dikars met it in
a strong clasp

  this is good jimcorbins voice shook and then he
was laughing all of a sudden

  whats funny dikar felt a little sore

  nothing only i just thought how close i was to

kicking this slat down here he jerked his head down
at a hole in the plaster right where his lifted foot had
been that would have set off a charge of dynamite in
the cellar fixed there to blow up my radio set and this
whole shebang with everyone in it when as and if i
was ever raided

  here ive sweated blood for three lonely terrible years
just trying to do a little bit for my country and id have
wound up by blowing sky-high the guy thats done more
for it than anyone except general fenton himself not
to speak of- his look went to bessalton and came
away hell dikar cant you see how funny that
would have been

  no dikar shook his head i cant

tut i can see something else marilee put in i
can see that if we keep on foolin around in this
house youll get your chance to kick that slat how
much longer do you think its goin to be before someones
sent from memphis to find out why those soldiers havent
come back

  oh lord jimcorbin groaned youre right wed
better be kiting out of here an pronto look if we
move quick we can make it up-river to v-twos shack at
tennemo without getting spotted and thats inside our
own lines what are we waitin for lets get started
you get started jimcorbin dikar said were hid-
in somewheres near here till it gets dark were not goin
up the river you see were goin down it to the gulf
to the gulf jim stared why in the name of
luke and the other eleven apostles would you want to go
there and how the blazes do you think youre going to get
there

  i cant tell you why my friend except that its not
because weve got a hankerin to swim in salt water an i
know as little as you do as to how all i know is that at
least one of us has got to get there an so one of us will
so i guess its goodbye dikar stuck out his hand again

  jimcorbin didnt take it okay he grunted if its
down-river its down-river youre not shaking me
once more his eyes went to bessalton and this time they
stayed on her not if i can help it

  nothin doin dikar hated to say it you cant-
wait marilee exclaimed wait dikar jimcor-
bin that truck out there that the asafrics came in-
can you drive it

  and how

  then we can get a uniform off one of the dead
asafrics dress jimcorbin up in it his hairs black al-
ready i saw only one tree out behind this house but

speedway

de luxe

blades

for fast smooth economical shaves


argosy

thats a walnut i can make a dye from its bark that will
stain his skin as dark as yours youll both look
like abyssinians you can tie us girls up in the back of
the truck we can be your prisoners an youre takin
us south

  by jerusalem jimcorbin said softly it might
work ive heard the asafrics are careless down deep in
their own territory so if we can only get through this
zone around here where the truck might be recognized i
know all the backroads from here to salt water ive had
to know where our agents are posted what do you say
dikar shall we try it

  its crazy dikar looked from jimcorbins face to
marilees excited one inside his head he was hearing
a tired old voice that said i cannot believe that if we
need a miracle to save america he will not help us to
work that miracle

  and dikar was thinking how everything seemed to fit
into marilees scheme the asafrics with their uniforms
and their truck jimcorbin to drive it even that the one
tree near the house should be a walnut tree it was as if
he had brought dikar and the girls here had sent the
asafrics here to take jimcorbin all at exactly the same
time because that was his way of working the miracle
normanfenton prayed for

   its the craziest idea anyone ever heard of dikar said
slowly well try it get busy everybody

  even in here he could hear the sound of the river the
c-ndless rush of its waters but somehow it was a friendly
sound now a sound that told him he was doing right

   there were four now not one and the river had brought
them together they were four and they were going
south with the flow of the river to work a miracle that
america might have a tomorrow



  from a history of the asiatic-african world hege-
mony zafir uscudan phd bombay lld singa-
pore  fihs etc third edition vol  chap xxvii
ppff

     the thousand and one versions of the legend of
dikar have brought down to us as many differing ac-
counts of his amazing odyssey from memphis to the mis-
sissippis mouth but diligent research fails to unearth a
single detail sufficiently authenticated to merit repetition
in a scholarly history of the time

  it would be surprising if the contrary were true men
were not concerned with writing history in those days
when the great insurrection approached its apogee they
were making it

  the guerilla bands with which the americans had begun
their fight for freedom were at last coalescing into recog-
nizable armies that had driven the asafrics out of a wide
swath of territory stretching across mid-continent from
the atlantic seaboard to the rockies eastern slope

  in far-off panama viceroy yee hashamotos tanks were
setting out on their drive up through central america
and mexico and texas to destroy the presumptuous
slaves benighted europe   

   in all the documents that we have examined we
can find only two references to dikars mission the
first is this poignant entry in general norman fentons
diary

     may  today entrusted to oikar my only hope of saving
  the cause from complete disaster can any prospect so nebu-
  lous be called a hope even if he wins unscathed through six
  hundred miles teeming with hashamotos black and yellow
  troops even if he somehow devises a way to cross the gulf
  what awaits him

     have i just sent that fine lad to his death with no reason
  to justify me except sheer desperation a dozen years ago
  an uncertain number of our people fleeing the invaders
  were swallowed up by the dark jungle of the quintana roo
  since that day no word from them has ever reached the outer
  world

    do they still live what have they become what right
  have i to think that even if they still exist and can be roused
  to aid us they can accomplish anything against the armored
  juggernauts of the asafrics

    only he can answer who has brought us thus far on the
  road to a free tomorrow devoutly humbly i place in his
  hands the fate of this nation that has suffered so much

     if he fail us-but that must not be it cannot be

  the other bit of authentic data is a page from the
log of station v- of the secret net at tennemo tenn
a code message received here at  a m may thir-
tieth from operative v- james corbin reveals that
dikar inexplicably had been joined by his wife mary
lee marilee and another girl- of dikars bunch elisa-
beth alton bessalton

  these had just rescued corbin from an asafric raid on
his station near memphis the two men disguised as
abyssinians the girls posing as their prisoners they
were about to attempt to penetrate the enemys territory
in an army truck captured from the raiding party

    were going to blow up the station the message con-
  tinues and with it the bodies of the asafrics who tried to
  take me together with that of an extra dikar killed earlier
  today

     that last were going to dress up in my clothes and make
  sure that hes messed up enough that hell be counted for me
  were hoping that anyone sent to find out whats keeping
  the detachment wont notice that the ruins of the truck are
  nowhere in the mess

     that way with luck there will be no hue and cry after us
  and we might have a chance to get away with this nutty stunt
  well om thirty when you hear the boom look over this
  way and maybe youll see old v- go up in a cloud of smoke

  that smoke-cloud veils the intrepid quartet from our
  sight when it thins again to again permit us a glimpse
  of them it is four days later and they are somewhere in
  that dim region of swamp and bayou on the border of
  barataria bay where centuries before jean lafitte and his
  buccaneers held forth   

chapter xiv

mirror of the world

the tree dikar climbed was like something in a dream

    it was very like any one of the hemlocks on the
 mountain where hed grown up and in a strange way
 it was very different

  it had a straight tall trunk its branches forked and
  forked again till they became twigs and the twigs were
  fringed with short stubby green needles like a hemlocks

  but this tree had round purple-colored fruit where a
  hemlock would have cones it stood straddled high above
  a brooding lake on roots like gray knobbed knees its
  bark was loose on its trunk in long gray shreds and
  strangest of all its branches were festooned with some
  gray dry-seeming stuff like looped beards that made the
long road to tomorrow



tree seem old older than time itself and vaguely fright-
ening

  as dikar climbed the tree his legs and arms were
heavy the way ones legs and arms seem in a dream and
he was wet with sweat that was because the air was
so heavy in this land steamy and hard to breathe

  this land to which following the course of the river
they had come was all strange as this tree it was choked
with plants of a kind dikar had never before seen dark
green and strange-leaved and murmursome

   dark little streams wandered slow through it sullen and
silent very different from the cheerfully babbling little
streams on the mountain a strange smell hung about
the streams and the glowering lakes into which they
spread

  dikar reached the top of the tree he saw the sky
even the sky was strange in this strange land it was
big and empty and it pressed down close on the lush
green land and the land seemed to crouch under it afraid
it was a strange strange color a sort of reddish yellow
like metal heated and no wind came out of it

  he hadnt come up here to look at the sky dikar re-
minded himself hed come up to look along the road
down which their truck had rocked and slithered last night
till the girls had cried out that they couldnt stand it any
more and jimcorbin had stopped it beside the black
glimmer of a half-seen lake

dikar could make out the road for a little way
where it followed the edge of the lake but then it
curved back into the queer green woods and he couldnt
see it any more

  it was little more than a path black mud with green
things sprouting out of it nothing moved on the part of
the road he could see and from where the road vanished
he could hear no sound of life

  no sound of human life came to dikar and that was
what hed hoped for but no sight no sound of living
beasts or birds came to him though the night just ended
bad been noisy with startling screams spine-chilling roars
little scutterings

  it was as if between the end of night and dawn all the
wild things had fled something awful that was going to
happen that sky    dikar shrugged wiped sweat
from his forehead with the back of his hand started to
climb down he was a sissy letting himself be scared by
the way a sky looked why there wasnt so much as a
cloud in it

  he slid down to one of the trees gray knees sprang
across four feet of water to the bank where marilee and
bessalton stood each holding two of the rifles theyd
taken from the asafrics just beyond them was the truck
and from its drivers seat jimcorbin looked a question
at dikar

  all clear dikar answered it go ahead

  the noise of the starting motor was awful loud in the
green hush jimcorbin twisted the steering wheel and
the truck was moving turning on the road the wheels
crunched the greenery of the lakes bank and went into
the water and the truck went out into the water

  greenish light trailed the truck wheels like the dark
water had turned to a queer liquid fire where they moved
jimcorbin patted the steering wheel with his hand said
 bye baby and jumped from his seat landed alongside
the others

  the truck kept going that strange green glow rippling
where its wheels passed all of a sudden its nose dipped
and it slid slowly almost as if it knew what was happen-
ing under the water

  where it had been was only a great pool of gteen
glow on the surface of the dark water that faded was
gone

 ou figured right dikar said it got to the edge
of that deep hole we found with sticks this morning
before the water drowned its motor

  yeah she did all right jimcorbin tall in his
green asafric uniform his face dark with the walnut stain
marilee had put on it looked unhappy you know
something dikar i feel like ive murdered an old friend
he chuckled suddenly the little laughing lights in his
brown eyes once more that had never quite gone out of
them will you listen to jim corbin getting sentimental
over a bunch of steel and wood well dikar the gulfs
about a mile from here that way and the trucks gone
so youre in charge from now on whats next on the
program

  get to the gulf of course an find some way to get
across it come on

  he took his rifle from marilee and jimcorbin took his
from bessalton and they got started the path went on
and on through the green hush of these dim woods and
turned and got so narrow that they had to go single file
dikar leading jimcorbin bringing up the rear

   they crossed a stream on the bridge of a fallen log and
when theyd gone a little way further the path bent
sharply around a big tree like the one dikar had climbed
and he saw light ahead striking through the tangle

  the light grew stronger dikar pushed through a bush
that stretched its twigs across the path

  all of a sudden there were no more leaves no more
trees there was only the strange reddish-yellow sky
ahead of him overhead and out fn front and rounding
down under-

  no above and in front of dikar was the sky but
what was under the sky was water stretching out and
out till it met the sky the water so still so smooth that
it was like the mirror into which hed looked while hed
blackened his golden hair and beard and just the way
that mirror had pictured his face the water pictured the
sky

  the girls came out of the woods and dikar heard their
breath catch in their throats as they stepped stockstill
beside him

oand sloped down from their feet to the water and then
 the water began and went out on and on endlessly
and there was no other shore out there but only the red-
dish-yellow water and the reddish-yellow sky rounding
down to meet it sky and water enclosing a space un-
thinkably vast and empty

  the water heaved slowly dikar saw now as if the
world itself breathed in deep sleep and halfway up the
round of the sky an immense scarlet ball was the night-
mare sun of the sleeping worlds dread-filled dream

  this sandat whose edge they stood ran away from
them left and right curving outward till it became two
long points of land that reached out into the water black
against the reddish-yellow glow like two great arms
embracing the water but the water stretched away be-


argosy

tween the ends of the arms into that vast and lonely
nothingness

  the end of the world marilee murmured her voice
low hushed weve come to the end of the world dikar
jimcorbin chuckled not quite kid not quite the
end of the world just the gulf of mexico

  the gulf dikar exclaimed but wheres yuca-
tan

  due south mlad straight ahead the way were fac-
ing

  straight ahead why cant we see it then

  because after about thirty miles your line of sight
skids off the round of the earth-

  the earth isnt round its flat look dikar waved
his arm out in front of him you can see that its as flat
as-well its flat

  holy mackerel dont tell me you never learned-
no jimcorbin checked himself there wasnt anyone
on that mountain of yours to teach you theyd told
him all about their mountain on the way down

  well youll just have to take my word for it the
earths round and thats why the horizon that line
where the sky seems to meet the water is only about
thirty miles from here but the gulf goes on and on about
five hundred miles more and then theres yucatan
where you want to go

  five hundred miles dikar repeated dismayed
thats almost as far as weve come already i knew it
was too far to swim but five- he broke off whats
that noise

jimcorbin cocked his head and listened to the quick
pop-pop-pop that had suddenly rapped against the
brooding hush id say it was an auxiliary motor some-
ones been having trouble with an has just managed to
get started again the boat its on is hidden from us by
that headland

  he pointed to the arm of land on the left by the
same token were hidden from whoevers on it now if by
some miracle we could get hold of that dikar it would
be a better way of getting across the gulf than swim-
ming

  by some miracle its funny you should say that
jimcorbin thats exactly what normanfenton said he
was going to pray for some miracle to help me

  prayers no good any more dikar in this lousy world
-get back hide everybody that damned luggers
coming around the headland

  they jumped back into the bushes just far enough to

screen them and then they were peering through the
green curtain at the boat that poked its nose into view
far out there and was skimming the glassy surface of ie
gulf

  oh shes a beauty jimcorbin breathed a thirty-
five footer if shes an inch sloop-rigged and as clean
lines as ive ever seen that one was never built in an
asafric yard not on your life

  there are asafrics on her now though dikar liked
the boat too low to the water it was like a white bird
i can see three of them yellow they are officers
youve got good eyes guy if you can make out the
color of their skin though even i can see the green of
their uniforms they must have been caught in the calm
jimcorbin mused and then found that their pusher was
kaput the devil theyre putting about now what
theyre coming in here  marilees fingers were cold
on dikars wrist theyre goin to land right here weve
got to get away quick

  jimcorbin laughed a little harshly looks like youre
right theyre sure heading straight for this cove but
thats nothing to get all hot an bothered about it will
take them twenty minutes or more the rate theyre travel-
ing however i guess wed better be going on our way
how about it dikar

  ugh

  i asked how about our getting started away from
here

  dikar looked around at him eyes narrowed brow knit-
ted were not goin away jimcorbin were goin to stay
here an wait for em

  wait for- are you clean out of your noodle 

  no you just said that prayers no good any more
in this lousy world well youre wrong normanfenton
prayed for me to find a way to get to yucatan an theres
the answer to his prayer that boats goin to take us
there

  could be jimcorbin whispered could very well
be there are four of us an only three of them an even
if they are armed we can pick them off with our rifles
as they come in

  its taking an awful chance the sound of firing will
carry for miles across the water its sure to be heard at
port eads or morgan city or both and unless the asa-
frics are dumber than i think therell be a destroyer out
to see what the shootings for those babies are fast
theyll overhaul that sloop in nothing flat and-

-	there aint goin to be any shootin dikar said quiet-

rthe sky is bleak the day is gray

     and discouraging outside our
 window and we have been thinking
 with approval of those warm lands
 where a soft breeze whispers in from
 the sea and the grass skirts swish
 pleasantly we were wishing that we
 had a nice south seas story to read

    the desire for change is an import-
 ant motive in peoples choice of read-
 ing and right now because of the
 mood were in we cant see why it
 isnt the only one but it isnt we
 know for instance that cowboys en-
 joy western stories that policemen
 often relax with a good murder
 mystery weve heard that criminals
 like to read about crime but we
 wouldnt know for sure of course
 the prizefighter hurrying from the
 ring to finish a boxing serial the pilot
 intent on an air story after a danger-
 ous day in the sky-very strange

    nothing could be less attractive to
 us than a tale about an editor trapped
 in his office sealed in by raw weather
 but then again perhaps there are pos-
 sibilities in that theme perhaps along
 about the third installment sooner if
 possible the editor could be con-
 veyed to a distant and exotic clime a
 place disturbed only by whispering
 breezes and swishing skirts

   and why are we fooling around
 with daydreams when there is mail on

 this for the luwa pete why must you

 but very few classify serials alone here

 philadelphia penna

 iur next correspondent brings up
  a matter of interest to all readers
 of westerns he has a pointed ques
 tion to ask and -fortunately were able
 to answer it read on youll see

josh r berwick

    i read somewhere or other that almost
 none of the western story writers have
 ever been in the west and that they
 wouldnt know what a horse looks like
 this article said that they read a couple
 of books about the west and then start
 to write stories it said that most of
 the information in their stories is
 wrong

    now i dont care much whether the
 information is right or wrong i enjoy
 westerns for the sake of the story and
 if a man can write a good story about
 the west without ever having been
 there why all the more credit to him

    but still somehow i dont believe it
 i think the best western writers must
 know something about their subject and
 ive gotten into arguments about it with
 some friends of mine they tell me im
 gullible well i wish you would help
 me out no matter what you say ill
 keep right on reading westerns but
 im curious about the writers

 albany new york

 yte too have been told that all
  western writers were born and
 raised in brooklyn and never got any
 further west well we can assure
 mr berwick that it is not true the
 sight of bennett foster walking into
 this office under a large sombrero
 would convince anybody

    mr foster has ridden the range he
 knows whereof he speaks another
 ex-cowhand is walt coburn and he
 told us once that he has to get the
 details and idiom in his stories exactly
 right or else his friends out west
 hooraw him something fearful
