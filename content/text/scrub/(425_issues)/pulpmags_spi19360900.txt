september stcfries cexts in this issue- stories by ioyce annocr hex coo pe h unoyeh heonhe hinxaby ives that was great dear lets make the next number the wedding ---march quick easy way to learn music how a changed my name from miss to mrs

less than a year ago i was
friendless lonely unhappy
then came the amazing event that
changed my whole life

  heres how it happened

  one evening i was sitting in my
lonely room gazing from the win-
dow from across the street came
the sound of jazz and happy
laughter i could see couples
dancing-others talking-all hav-
ing a good time

  everything seemed to center
around the girl at the piano-
mary nelson how i envied her
she had friends popularity hap-
piness-all the things i longed for
-but didnt have

  the next afternoon
i dropped over to see
mary-told her how
lonely and depressed
i felt to cheer me
up mary sat down
at the piano and
played waltzes jazz
bits sonatas when
she had finished i
sighed enviously

  thanks mary it
was wonderful what
wouldnt  give to
play like that but
its too late now i
should have had a

teacher when i was in school-
like you

 mary smiled and said ann i
never had a teacher in my life in
fact not so long ago i couldnt play
a note

 impossible  cxclamiccl itow
did you do it

 then she told me about a wonder-
ful new short-cut method of learning
music that had been perfected by the
u s school of music you learn real
music from the start when i left
mary it was with new hope if she
could lecun to play this way so could
i that very night  wrote for the
free book and demonstration lesson

 i never dreamed that learning to
play the piano could be so simple-
even easier than mary had pictured
it and as the lessons continued they
seemed to get easier although i
never had any talent i was play-
ing my favorites-almost before i
knew it

 then came the big
night at margaret jones
party what a moment
that was when our
hostess apparently trou-
bled exclaimed isnt
it a shame that mary
xelson cant be here to
play the piano

  i spoke up ill try
to fill marys place-if
youre not too critical
everyone seemed sur-
prised why i didnt
know she played
someone behind whis-
pered

  as i struck the first
rippling chords of
nevins lovely narcis-
sus a hush fell over
the room i could hardly
believe it but-i was
holding the party spell-
bound

when i finished you should have heard
them applaud everyone insisted i
play more only loo glad i played
piece after piece before the evening
was over  had been invited to three
more parties and it wasnt long
until  met tom who shortly after-
ward asked me to become his wife

he-man for harriet

by

grover

george

  i-im-l-lost be-
gan harriet in a small
voice and its getting
dark

harriet mason managed the last
few yards up the steep face of the
mountain toward the little cabin
perched at the top she was panting heavily
from the unaccustomed exertion her deep
breaths bringing into startling prominence the
graciously rounded curves of firmly out-thrust
cones beneath her loose blouse open at the
neck the unconfined hillocks rose and fell
rapidly fortunately or unfortunately de-

pending on how you choose to look at it there
was no one there to get a glimpse of that
tantalizing sight

  harriet turned impatiently jerking at the
reins of the horse which was limping up the
trail behind her as she bent forward in order
to get a better grip on the leather thongs the
superb white mounds almost popped out of
their flimsy covering

  turning towards the cabin again she stum-

a
bled wearily up the rough trail her riding
boots built for style but not for heavy use
causing her to wince at every step

  hopefully she knocked at the door at once
there was a response inside a chair scraped
heavy footsteps sounded the door was flung
open by more than six feet of splendidly virile
manhood deeply bronzed from life in the
open harriet found herself looking up into
clear blue eyes at a strongly acquiline nose
and firm chin instinctively she compared the
solid breadth of shoulder and the rippling
muscles under his rough blue shirt with the
physiques of the eastern visitors at the dude
ranch where she was stopping

  yes  said the man pleasantly in a vibrant
baritone

  i-im lost began harriet in a small
voice its getting dark my horse fell and
lamed himself and i saw your cabin here so
i thought id take a chance and see if you
could show me how to get back to the ranch

  the man looked at her appraisingly his
keen eyes swept quickly but appreciatively over
the unmistakable swells beneath her low-
necked blouse over the trim curves snugly en-
cased in expensive riding breeches

  you must be cold wearing an outfit like
that he said step inside and sit down be-
fore the fire ill take care of your horse

  thank you harriet brushed past him his
hard forearm pressing lightly against her
round smooth shoulder at the contact a tiny
shiver of delight ran through the girl she
drew up a chair before the fire sat down and
gratefully warmed herself before the cheerful
blaze outside she heard the man going down
the trail and speaking soothingly to the horse
a few moments later she heard him entering
the cabin

  whats your name he asked brusquely

  startled harriet turned wide grey eyes up
to him harriet mason whats yours

  not that it makes any difference he said
grimly but im stephen garland i notice
your horse carries the lazy  brand insignia
on a saddle blanket

  thats right

  im sorry but i havent time to waste on
a gadabout from pete hendersons dude ranch
ill show you the trail down and youll just
have to take care of yourself

  but i dont understand harriet ex-
claimed ive heard a lot about western hos-
pitality but the example you give me isnt very
satisfying

  im sorry he said stiffly ive a serious
purpose in life im a mining engineer and im
here on a surveying trip you easterners seem
to think you can come out west here act as
you would at a country club and get away
with it youre lucky nothing worse happened
i suppose your horse fell because you didnt
know how to handle him

  naturally said harriet cuttingly i
couldnt expect to be as expert with a horse
as you are angrily she rose stamped to
the door her big riding boots making her look
absurdly childish for an instant she thought
she detected a softening in the mans eyes a
tender glow but when she looked again he
was impersonal distant

  youll have to leave your horse here for
the night and send some one up from the
ranch for it you can easily follow the trail
down and if it gets dark dont be frightened
im sure you wouldnt want g worry pete
henderson

  he pointed out a well defined path down the
mountainside in the direction opposite from
the one harriet had taken to come up to his
cabin defiantly the girl started down stamp-
ing her boots into the rough earth as though
working off some of her annoyance

  thanks she flung over her shoulder ill
send you a check for your services

  just what i might expect he shot back

  as she continued down the trail determined
not to give the brute the satisfaction of seeing
that every step hurt she turned under an
arch of trees that shut her from his sight and
at once she felt very small and lonely in the
cool darkness of the mysterious woods in the
shadows she couldnt very well see where she
was going before she realized what was hap-
pening her ankle had turned on a loose stone
an excruciating pain shot up her left leg she
remembered that she let out one scream before
everything went black   

  harriet struggled up out of the mists of
unconsciousness and looked around wonder-
ingly she found herself lying on a rude bunk
against one wall and a second glance assured
her that she was back in garlands cabin but
something peculiar was happening firm mas-
culine lips were pressed lingeringly against her
own muscular masculine arms were holding
her tightly but tenderly in the moment it
took her to collect her wits harriet found
herself responding almost against her will to
garlands eager mouth on hers in spite of


herself she knew that little shivers were chas-
ing up and down her spine

  garland seeing she had recovered conscious-
ness drew back harriet pretended she was
quite unaware of what had happened and even
managed the tried true expression where
am i

  its all right said the man soothingly
you sprained your ankle going down the
trail fortunately i heard you scream i car-
ried you back here and tried to fix it up as
well as i could

  harriet glanced down she found that both

go away she yelled
dont you see i was taking

a dip

her boots were off and that both her feet were
bare around her right ankle was a mass of
tape applied with all the skill of a surgeon

i thought at first you had a broken ankle
but i guess youll pull through all right i had
to cut your boot to get it off-your ankle was
about twice its ordinary size by the time i
got you back here

thanks murmured harriet weakly but
why this sudden change of attitude

well if i dont like pete henderson thats
one thing but letting you die on the trail with
a twisted ankle is another thing im probably
not as bad as you think i am

what makes you think i think youre bad

not that i blame you if you do only
you pampered easterners are more interested
in bridge gossip drinking and man chasing
than anything else-even when you come out
here presumably for a vacation

does that mean you think i fit that descrip-
tion 

youre a guest at petes ranch arent
you

you take an awful lot for granted but i


suppose i owe you something for bringing me
back here it seems im occupying your
bunk harriet attempted to rise but sank
back with a groan as she moved her foot

  and youll stay in my bunk all night too
said garland in a tone that allowed no denial

  but what will you do

  oh dont worry about me ill either sleep
on the floor or go to town and spend the night
there

  afraid of me

  no-but i dont like the idea of those gos-
sip hounds down at petes talking about us
especially if we stayed all night together in the
same cabin knowing them as i do i know
very well what theyll say

  but im not afraid of my reputation why
should you be asked harriet

  it isnt my reputation im afraid of be-
sides i expect to have you as a guest for a day
or so and ill need more provisions

  harriet sat up carefully leaning back on
her elbows the action throwing into bold re-
lief the firm swells beneath her blouse draw-
ing garlands eyes like a magnet slowly he
approached the bunk he sat down beside her
slipped one powerful arm about her waist
contentedly she let her head drop on his shoul-
der then raised it to meet his their mouths
joined fused in a kiss that started around two
hundred degrees fahrenheit and went up to a
thousand

  steves hand moved toward her then the
muscles of his jaw bulged he drew back his
hand and rose from the bunk

  im sorry he said i shouldnt have done
that

  why were you kissing me when you
thought i was unconscious

  steve flushed a deep stain showing through
his bronze if id known you were that con-
scious he said i certainly wouldnt have
done it ill see you in the morning good
night abruptly he turned and walked from
the cabin harriet looked after him a great
aching void where her heart should have been

  harriet awoke the next morning to find
the little cabin filled with glorious mountain
sunshine the air sweet with dew and the odor
of fresh growing things gingerly she tried
to walk from the bunk she found to her de-
light that her ankle wasnt sprained at all but
merely twisted and that she could hobble about
without too much difficulty provided she did
not put her weight on the injured foot

  she rummaged around started the fire billed
the coffee pot and hung it over the flame then
she limped from the cabin to a little stream
that ran behind it she bathed her face in the
clear cold water then looked around and
moved by a sudden naughty impulse began to
peel off her clothes

  in a moment her bathing attire consisted of
flimsy panties and a bandeau that clung to her
like tissue paper and the dressing on her
ankle

  if the water had been calm she might have
been able to see the reflection of gorgeous
white deliciousness a mirrored picture of firm-
ly rounded mounds of delicately curved hips
that quivered as she walked of milky white
thighs that curved downward to shapely calves

  the cold mountain air brought a rosy glow
to her sweet white skin instinctively as if to
keep off the cold she covered the roundness
that comprised her shapely shoulders with tiny
palms then gritting her teeth she stepped
into the cold water

  at first she shivered and her teeth chat-
tered  then as she splashed around she began
to grow warm

  above the noise of the stream her ears
caught the measured hoofbeats of a horse in
a panic she looked around off in the distance
she could see a mounted figure riding slowly
up the trail without a doubt it was steve
coming back from town with provisions

  in a panic harriet scrambled out of the
water ran on to the bank her twisted ankle
slowing her movements she remembered she
had neglected to see that she had a towel and
as steve approached the cabin she could do
no more than cower on the brink of the stream
holding before her the sole garment she had
removed

  dont come near here she screamed i
havent got my dress on

  startled steve turned in his saddle then
seemed to reel back as the sight of harriet
shielded by what she held before her struck
him harriet knew that the pink-tinted skin of
her lovely form was right in his line of vision
she had a fairly good idea that he could dis-
tinguish her general outlines if nothing more

  garland laughed held his hand over his
eyes and turned the horses head

  i wont let the horse look at you either
he said im going to arrange the provisions
i hope by the time im finished doing that you
will be dressed again

  five minutes later damp from her plunge


  harriet leaned against him for a mo-
ment delighting in the feel of his solid
strength then hobbled about the cabin in her
bare feet pouring coffee and frying bacon

  guess you havent got a sprained ankle
after all said garland pretty luck for you
which reminds me-i brought a pair of easy
shoes for you to wear he rummaged through
a pack drew out a pair of soft soled mocca-
sins into which she gratefully stepped

  youre a dear said harriet impulsively
she slipped her arms around his neck and
raised her dewy fresh provocative lips gar-

lands head came down his mouth closed over
hers his arms tightened about her rounded
slenderness for a long lingering moment har-
riet forgot about the ranch about her ankle
about everything except the fact that she was
in steves arms and that their kisses were
responding to each other

  through her flimsy blouse she felt her firm-
ly swelling bosom mashed against steves solid
chest the pressure sending little waves of de-
light radiating along her nervous system

  suddenly steve stiffened pushed her away

harriet hobbled into the cabin in a state of
extreme confusion her milky white skin flush-
ing scarlet her eyes downcast steve shook her
gently by the shoulders tilted up her head
looked into her ashamed eyes

  dont be silly he said i only caught a
glimpse of you and what i did see was per-
fectly proper lets forget about it and eat

startled she looked up into his eyes which
had suddenly grown cold

  i suppose he said in a hard voice you
would kiss anyone who did a little thing for
you

 guess you
havent got a
sprained ankle
after all said
garland

harriets face flamed how dare you
youre the most unreasonable brute i ever en-
countered

  im sorry if i gave you any wrong ideas
about how i felt he said distantly

  but this is so silly said harriet why
should you think-

  because i know pete henderson and the
kind of crowd he has at his place i forgot to
tell you that i was down at the ranch this
morning and that they are sending up an extra
horse for you youll be able to leave sometime
this afternoon


  you had no right to go to the ranch i
want to stay here and no one can stop me ill
pay for my board and lodging

  that would hardly be possible said gar-
land dryly think of what people would say
i dont care what people would say har-
riet almost sobbed if you think that way
about me then what anyone else thinks doesnt
mean very much

  does my opinion matter so much to you
no she flung back i was only trying
to flatter you

  they ate their meal in silence harriet
washed the dishes she knew that steve tried
not to look at her but nothing he could do
could keep his eyes away from those delicious
rotundities

  i have work to do he complained i have
to go down in the gulch to examine some
specimens of rock

  well im not stopping you am i  i just
feel like staying up here on the mountain top
instead of down there at the ranch you go
ahead with your old prospecting dont bother
about me

  i certainly will

  while harriet sunned herself outside
the cabin door bringing a light tan to her skin
steve spent his time preparing his equipment
for a prospecting expedition harriet watched
curiously asking no questions as he assembled
a pack composed of geological hammers a
pick a shovel rations water and various mys-
terious packages

  steve stopped in the door im leaving he
announced you can prepare lunch for your-
self and pete will send a horse for you this
afternoon

  goodbye said harriet coolly steve
looked at her stood irresolute then flung his
pack to the ground before she knew what was
happening he had swept her up in his arms
crushed her against his chest and pressed his
mouth savagely against hers she felt her
whole being responding to his virile love-mak-
ing delighted in the feel of her soft bosom
crushed against his chest in the painful tingle
of his hard arms around her waist

  steve set her down for a moment whats
the use he groaned im only kidding my-
self if i went down to the gulch i wouldnt
be able to do any work anyway because all
i can think of is you

  harriet started to say something but found
herself prevented from doing so in the most

delightful possible manner finally she man-
aged to free herself

  i knew it she exclaimed triumphantly
you couldnt fool me when you acted so
nasty this morning i determined to make you
fall in love with me well you are in love with
me and when the horse comes this afternoon
im going back and youll never see me again
ill show you that even if you are a westerner
you cant treat me like this

  steve looked stunned then an angry
gleam came into his eyes he slammed the
door behind him advanced toward her men-
acingly so you think youll get away with
it do you  you cant make me fall in love with
you and then throw me over like this

  who says i cant demanded harriet
ive done it havent i 

  a sinewy hand fell on her shoulder whirled
her around

  harriet found herself lifted twisted dis-
covered she was being gripped on her shoul-
ders by a pair of strong hands the fingers dig-
ging into the fleshy part of her shoulders then
all of a sudden she was being shaken back
and forth becoming so dizzy that the room
seemed to be spinning around and around but
at the same time she thrilled at the realization
that she had at last found a man who could
master her

  steve finally picked her up and sat her down
comfortably there were tears in her eyes but
she smiled through them

  steve darling she said her arms went
around his neck even as his closed about her
waist

  im sorry honey he murmured but you
just didnt know what you were doing to me

  i dont care whispered harriet i just
discovered that weak-kneed easterners arent
to my liking at all

  steve laughed walked to the door and threw
the bar across it then he turned around and
came back to her she found herself returning
kiss for kiss that steve planted on her mouth
her throat and in the deliciously shadowy hol-
lows in her throat   

  out of a rosy haze harriet heard steves
chuckling voice that horse is coming this
afternoon honey do you still want to go
back 

  dont ask such foolish questions she mur-
mured as she drifted off once more on wings
of ecstasy dont you know that a mountain
cabin is the best place in the world for a honey-
moon 


  is this what you call an audition 


 star chaser

a full-length novelette complete
in this issue
 by
 barnaby ives

the broadcasting station was kept locked they
were waiting she supposed to leap upon jef-
frey winslow when he appeared then she
scowled for over the heads of the girls showed
one lone male

of all people in the world wendy had no
desire to see that one person shed taken him
over when she had taken the family home upon

wendy looked out rather impatiently
the receptionist sat entranced before
a loud speaker blondined head pressed
to the drum outside the walk lined on each
side were girls eager girls waiting to leap
upon the singer who was keeping the recep-
tionist off duty by his song

  wendys truly lovely mouth twisted she
couldnt get out until the receptionist came
to and opened the door the girls outside were
the fourteen best reasons why the door into

her shoulders and given up silliness forever
silliness such as waiting for singers to appear
as those girls were doing

oh im sorry miss dawn the recep-
tionist had come to and was taking up her
keys i cant get enough of mr winslows
singing can you

hes good i guess wendy said indiffer-
ently see here cant you let me out some
other door theres someone i dont want to
see out there

   why yes you can take the door mr wins-
low uses see under the stairway and it locks
with a nightlock so all you need do is open it
and slam it after you the receptionist said
eagerly and turned back to her listening

  you could see even famous dancers like
may dawn often but you couldnt always
listen to a singer like jeff winslow besides
it was the receptionists private opinion may


dawn wasnt so much why she was actually
plain except for her body the receptionist
did concede she had a lovely rounded body
with outthrust pointed bosom but she certain-
ly did not dress like a dancer who was the
citys rave among the nightowls right now
look at the plain ivory sharkskin sports dress
white silk anklets white buck ghillies even the
white silk beret tugged down over her brown
hair wasnt anything the receptionist couldnt
afford if she wanted it

  may dawn didnt wear a darned bit of color
except the bright blue scarf twisted about her
throat and a girl wouldnt see that the blue
was the exact shade of the big blue eyes under
demurely lowered brown lashes

  wendy who at night was may dawn
rounded the corner and at the very door she
bumped head first into someone hurrying from
the other way she forced a grunt from him so
hard did she ram him and looked up to apolo-
gize and discovered it was the young man for
whom the lines had formed on the front walk
none other than jeffrey winslow baritone
supreme

  oh im sorry she said contritely i was
in a hurry i was afraid 

  dont worry he said rudely you didnt
let me escape what is it this time an auto-
graph he looked at her exactly as though
shed been a rattlesnake and his eyes were an
angry brown

  wendy grinned a thoroughly wendish grin
oh mr winslow how did you guess she
cooed and opened her purse and pulled out a
pen and card

  he fairly snatched at the card and scrawled
his name looked out the glass said something
he never learned in kindergarten and dashed
down the hall some smart girl had discovered
the rear door and now a number of beaming
faces waited there

  wendy went out there since there was no
portly man in evening clothes waiting for her
though it was still far from evening trust
clarence to be forehanded well if he thought
he was going home with her and hang around
while she dressed he had another think com-
ing

  wendys car was parked in an alley city
ordinances to the contrary and wedged in be-
tween it and a truck was a tan roadster she
recognized as belonging to the singer not only
wedged but her rear bumper was so securely
locked to his front bumper she could not dis-
entangle them

  she was staring at the roadster and scowl-
ing when jeff winslow appeared on a run
his fans in full cry far behind

  he gave the small coupe a look of resigna-
tion wendy one of fury lifted the rear end
of her car and thrust it ahead and fairly threw
himself into his own car wendy had to run
to catch up with her car

  he thinks i did that on purpose to attract
his attention she grinned ruefully as she
drove out of the alley on two wheels as jeff
rapidly backed his car the length of the alley
taking in two ash cans and a fragrant garbage
can in his haste

  wendy completed some shopping still
grinning over the picture of clarence her mid-
dle aged fiance waiting patiently for her to
appear from the broadcasting rooms perhaps
it was thinking of the big blond singer which
made her turn her car into the family drive-
way without making the proper hand signal

  there was a rending crash as the car behind
her tried to avoid hitting hers and wrapped
itself around a tree

  gasping wendy rushed over to the tangled
mass and after removing two bags and an ar-
ray of loose golf clubs discovered jeff wins-
low under the wreckage

  he gave a groan that might have been from
pain when he saw who was at the bottom
of his accident youve broken my leg he
growled

  wendys huge irish dad appeared at this
moment now wendy what you done
now 

  shes broken my leg gritted jeff

  pat doon leaned down and lifted jeff bodily
and bore him up the driveway to the family
home crumbling beneath its mortgages jeff
was no light load being an inch over a six
foot measuring stick but pat doon was as
tall as that and weighed in at two ten so he
deposited jeff on the spare room bed with
scarcely an extra puff

  who are you son he asked when this
was done

  hes jeff jones dad wendy said hur-
riedly get his car out of the street will you 
ill call a doctor

  jeff said nothing but he looked volumes
that would have singed every book in the doon
library

  through the open window he heard pats
voice that fool kid of mine borrowed a
friends car and smashed it up give me a hand
with drawing it into my yard will you


  youre a fine family of liars arent you
jeff growled

  well do you want the reporters down on
you snapped wendy a trifle weary of his
temper want me to let anyone know

  no i was headed north on a vacation and
i think this will be a good place to spend it
as mr jones by the time im fixed up youll
have learned a few traffic rules and be heartily
sick of chasing me

  chasing you you were hard on my heels
but let it go does it hurt terribly wendy
bent over to look at the dangling leg and-jeff
gave her an angry once over

  she wasnt a pretty girl even her nose
turned up and her chin was stubborn her
mouth was too big too wide and bright crim-
son and she wasnt tanned a bit for all it was
summer he liked girls with healthy brown
skins and this one had a petal white skin which
seemed even whiter on her smooth shapely
throat which became revealed when her scarf
had come untied

  you might at least have been pretty he
grumbled

  wendys wide grin flashed she did have
beautiful teeth and her lashes turned up and
were dusted with gold on the ends and re-
vealed the bluest eyes hed erer seen

  sorry they left that out i suppose you
think it isnt a trial to me being so homely
men run into trees when they see me heres
the doctor

  then you run out jeff said unkindly and
was obeyed instantly

  well of all the alls in sweet dispositions
you take the prize cake wendy said ad-
dressing the firmly closed door

  the doctor reappeared he has a badly
cracked ankle and needs rest or it may affect
his    er singing i think he said he sang

  wendy bent quickly and picked up a ravel-
ling to hide her grin an injured ankle affect
his singing but that was part of her punish-
ment for reckless driving taking care of a
grouchy invalid

  he was in bed in one of his own pajama
suits when she returned to his room he didnt
look so ferocious now with his sleek hair
ruffled into blond feathers against the white
pillows

  pat followed her in got the wreck out
of sight and well see to having it fixed ill
take care of you nights and my daughter
wendy will do it daytimes

  and why cant she take care of me eve-
nings too jeff asked unreasonably

  because i go dancing with my fiance every
evening wendy said sweetly giving her
father a fiery look of warning

  jeff stared at her if youre engaged why
run after a singer he asked

  didnt you ever get a crush on anyone
wendy demanded sweetly your voice simp-
ly bowled me over and i had to get your auto-
graph

  jeff looked at her suspiciously i never get
crushes i was cured of girls early in life i
was engaged to a girl but when i gave up
working in the creamery to sing she washed
her hands of me ive had no use for girls
since so dont get any nutty ideas about me

  wendy flushed i told you i was engaged
she thrust her slim white hand before his
eyes and he blinked for a four carat stone
blazed on her ring finger his name is clar-
ence dilford now ill get you some supper
because i have a date at nine she dashed
away

  wendy never ran after any man before
pat muttered looking at jeff shes always
been content with my choice of husband

  so you chose him jeff said quickly
why

  girls are apt to be silly pat said hurried-
ly clarence now is fifty and crazy about her
he takes good care of her too takes all her
worries off her shoulders there he is now ill
have to let him in

  pat returned with a pompous papa as jeff
dubbed him at once this is the young man
jeff jones that wendy spilled clarence
clarence dilford mr jones

  clarence scowled at jeff who scowled back
whynt you send him to the hospital wendy
is too busy to bother with a hurt man

  but she wants to wendys voice said
sweetly behind him and clarence turned eag-
erly to greet her he put a big arm around
her and kissed her thoroughly though on the
cheek for wendy had turned her head at his
onslaught

  jeff saw the fat red hand clamp itself
around one shapely upper arm as he held
wendy and saw wendy grow scarlet and
break away why she was just a kid beside
that overgrown banker for that was what
clarence was he learned at once

  jeff did not see wendy go but he was awake
when she returned as dawn tinted the win-
dows he had had an uncomfortable evening


because strangely enough he had resented her
going dancing with the big man pat was good
company too but that didnt matter

  wendy came in softly and bent over jeff
she had changed to an old white wool robe
which fell away from her white throat reveal-
ing a deep valley between firm breasts which
were partly revealed too

  jeff pretended to sleep he was suddenly
ashamed of his ill nature wendy seemed to
be chief cook and bottle washer as well as his
day nurse and he was fooling her badly he
knew as well as the doctor did that his broken
ankle was a fake he had a bad sprain but
nothing more serious this had seemed a good
place to hide until the reporters gave up trying
to discover where the popular young singer
was vacationing

  strangely enough a week passed before he
realized it everything about the place was
genteelly shabby but wendy was a good cook
and good company too gay when he was
cross gentle when he was restless but every
night he was forced to hear her go away with
the red faced banker and return in the early
morning hours

  always she came in with fresh ice water for
him but he pretended to sleep because he had
a desire to shout at her for wasting herself
on an old man for preferring to be with
clarence when every other girl in the city
would give her eyes to be with him jelf wins-
low

  tomorrow hed get out his car was re-
paired as good as ever pat had reported his
incognito had been maintained by the simple
ruse of putting the license plates from
wendys car on jeffs while in the repair shop
there might never have been a popular bari-
tone for all people knew the way wendy acted
for a girl who wanted his autograph who had
parked so close to him she had to wait to let
him get her out wendy acted little like a
baritone-struck girl

  jeff was reading when wendy came in in
the early morning of the wakeful night in
which he had decided to leave the next day
she was in the same old robe and hastily pulled
it together when she saw that he was awake

  pain she asked gently and he saw that
she had been crying

  pain he mocked flicking her wet cheek
with his finger sit down and talk to me
wendy

  i cant i have to go to bed she said tired-
ly but sat down on the edge of his bed

  you treat me like poison oak he said dis-
contentedly

  what did you want me to do kiss you
wendy asked with a flicker of her gamin
eyes

  why yes maybe i did that wouldnt be a
bad idea no girl has kissed me for a week
jeffs hand closed around her wrist

  wendy gave a little tug which only pulled
her robe off her shoulder revealing dazzling
white skin beneath pm engaged 

  but couldnt you stand one kiss he
asked surprising himself because it seemed
interesting to think about kissing wendy

  wendy looked at him thoughtfully yes
i could

  jeff laughed and pulled her down into his
arms and kissed her triumphantly she was
like other girls she was all breathless and he
could feel her heart thumping under the robe
he tightened his hold of her and it wasnt at
all bad kissing a wide mouth rather swell in
fact so he did it again and could not stop

  wendy was trembling in his arms and
struggling to free herself then suddenly she
gave that up and pressed eagerly against him
and returned his kisses only half an hour ago
she had struggled with clarence struggled
against this very thing his kiss smothering
her his moist unpleasant hands on her body
it hadnt been a pretty battle and when wendy
had won clarence had delivered an ultimatum
it had consisted of this that a week from to-
day shed be mrs clarence dilford or hed
know why

  that was why she returned jeffs sweet
fierce kisses why she let his lips wander down
her throat to the purple hollow at its base and
back to her lips why she didnt fight his cool
hands upon her so caressingly let him trace
her straight dimpled spine the curving back
let him wander here and there until clarence
was lost to mind and nothing mattered except
jeff

  a long long time afterwards wendy re-
membered and crept out of jeffs arms to her
own room she didnt care it would be hard
to face him in day time remembering but she
would never forget never wanted to next
week shed belong to clarence because clarence
owned the mortgages on the shabby home
and pat had brought her mother to this home
and was broken-hearted at the thought of los-
ing it

  but wendy slept late and wakened just in
time to dress for dancing pat had tip-toed


about the house doing the things wendy al-
ways did surprised that she had overslept
surpri ed that wendys patient was sleeping
it gave wendy a good excuse for not seeing
jeff that day she thought as she bathed and
dressed in the new evening gown of spun
sugar in heavens own blue she had to draw
a feathery wisp of it around her white throat
because jeff had put his mark there not once
but several times

  oh you came back to him wendy said
inanely wondering if she showed her desire
to claw this sleek black cat-girls eyes out

  oh that was a little misunderstanding i
didnt want jeff to drag me all over the coun-
try while he sang but now he has a chance
to make a picture in hollywood this winter
so we could have a real home i came after
him as soon as he wrote me the news and im
taking him back home with me until hes all

  she was coming down the stairs when a
hatless girl came out of jeffs room a tall girl
with sleek black hair and smart furs and cold
black eyes her mouth was thin and scarlet
and too small for beauty it seemed to wendy
and what was she doing in jeffs room

  im viola wetherbee she said coldly as
she looked up at the radiant young girl in
delphinium-blue tulle white gardenias
nestled against her whiter skin jeff wins-
lows fiancee

well whatever you think it was worth to
look after him you can make out a bill for and
ill give you my check

 wendy shrugged he didnt tell you i
smashed him up  hes only been here a week
so we will call it square he can be moved

  violas laughter tinkled oh the bad boy
he just wanted a place to hide so he pretended
to be hurt worse than he was he only sprained
his ankle 


  and let me wait on him hand and foot for
that wendy asked

  probably you were glad to it must have
been a real thrill to wait on a famous person
smiled viola

  whats all this about you waiting on a
famous person came clarences voice behind
them and he appeared in the outer doorway
my dear young lady dont you know may
dawn doesnt thrill over famous people be-
cause shes famous herself or didnt miss
doon tell you she is the famous dancer known
as may dawn 

  violas black eyes shifted and she looked
scared about something does jeff know

  no and you neednt tell him snapped
wendy ill tell him goodbye now because
i only have an hour before i go on at the
misty roof she went past viola into jeffs
room

  he was dressed as he had been the morning
she had bumped into him at the broadcasting
building and was strapping a suitcase pat
stood by

  goodbye mr winslow hope you have a
pleasant trip wendy said coolly and noth-
ing told him she was remembering his arms
and kisses i cant stop to see you off because
mr dilford is waiting she hadnt given him
a chance to speak and didnt intend to some-
how she got out of the room again and clar-
ence hurried her away

  always thought he was someone besides
jeff jones he said smugly as his sleek car
whirled them toward the nightclub wonder
you didnt lose your head over him along with
half a million other silly dames

  but i had you clarence wendy said
lightly

  and he has that viola person clarence
said with great satisfaction well ive made
all arrangements and youll be mrs clarence
dilford this time next week he put out a
big fat arm and dragged her close and kissed
her long and greedily on the mouth

  for just a moment wendy submitted
maybe the magic would come back in clar-
ences arms if it only would    but when
his hand touched her back and crawled along
it she freed herself shuddering it wasnt
magic it was awful

  you wont do that next week clarence
panted youll make up for all your kitten-
ishness then i promise you that i wont be
easy either

  wendy closed her eyes and drew back into

her corner of the car until the chauffeur
opened the door before the nightclu there
wouldnt be any next week if dad diait want
to lose his home let him do something about
it besides trade her for it shed tell clarence
tomorrow tonight she wasnt up to battle
tonight all she could see was viola wetherbee
in jeffs arms viola would give with both
hands and she was beautiful jeff would love
warming her coldness

  jeff had said wendy wasnt pretty had
scolded her and been rude and shed fallen
head over heels in love with him

  pat was up when wendy got home which
was unusual got a cable from ireland the
doon men were both killed in an airplane
crash that leaves the estates to me i have
to leave at once it means money girl and no
more dancing when your contract is up well
live in ireland like kings

  it was hurly-burly after that getting her
father onto the boat writing a letter to clar-
ence who had been called away for a couple of
days so he telephoned some time during the
rush it gave her two days to move out of
the house and she did

  ireland the devil as compared to a home
with jeff on this side of the water

  wendy moved into a pretty apartment stor-
ing the goods unil her fatther should tell her
what he wanted done with them she kept the
jenny lind bed where jeff had spent a week
pretending to be hurt she didnt even hate
him for that because he had paid her in the
end for anything he had done to her memor-
ies werent terribly satisfying but at least she
had them

  clarence had been rather awful he had
raged and sworn vengeance so wendy had
had to hire a maid a fierce grim woman who
went with her to the nightclub and came home
with her and stood guard in wendys dressing-
room so clarence sat at a table every night
as he had always done and glowered at wendy
but left her alone he hoped her loneliness
would drive her back into his arms and he
grew quite purple in the face and short winded
as he plotted what he would do when that time
came

   jeffrey winslow gods gift to the fluffies
has become social minded making all the hot
nighteries wrote a columnist hes usually
with his bodyguard and very meek when girls
swarm about him for his autograph quite
a change from the autocratic young man who


took rear doors and freight elevators to escape
notice meanwhile producers in hollywood
wait rather impatiently for him to sign on the
dotted line

  wendy tossed the paper down jeff was
nuts if he thought he could keep the movies
waiting like this he wasnt even singing on

all about once there was a moliceman and a
biddle lum sitting on a stone curb chewing
gubber rum well jeff was singing at a bene-
fit for an orphanage maybe that explained the
silly song the children would enjoy it

  his song was over and now he was talking
to the orphans once there was a little girl
who loved to dance and she sang that song and

the radio as he had tonight he was condes-
cending to sing for a benefit which would be
broadcast but it was an exception what had
viola done to him that he acted so once she
had him back did she refuse to let him sing for
money 

  wendy left her dressing table in the stars
dressing room and turned on the radio jeffs
golden baritone rolled out in of all things
the silly song wendy sometimes sang around
the house though she hadnt any voice at all
as jeff had more than once told her it was

i used to laugh at her i wouldnt laugh now
if i could find her ive looked everywhere
for her she loves to dance and goes dancing
every night but she is never where i look ill
take her dancing everywhere if i can only
find her and ill let her sing all day long  
and now he was singing the silly song again
and that was all

  it was enough wendys eyes were like
stars she turned to the grim dragon of a
please turn to page 

his voice was coming over
the radio  i wouldnt
laugh now if i could find
her    ive looked every-
where 


ntghtly at eleven

by

cliff carruth

jack carter opened the door of his
bachelor apartment he left the lights out
and hurried through to the lounge room
eager and excited as a bridegroom on a honey-
moon carter lost little time getting to the
window was she there would she appear
later  every night at eleven so far she hadnt
disappointed would she-

   carters heart leaped he had hardly taken
up his position before it happened as if on
signal the window of the apartment directly
opposite across the courtyard yellowed into
light at the same moment a luscious bl nde
statuesque and beautiful wandered into view
carter sighed with relief and settled back com-
fortably to enjoy the show

  and a show it was

   first the blonde began to undress carter
appreciated that as a producer of broadway
hot spot floor shows he was used to having
em disrobe the difference was that when they
did it on order it wasnt half as interesting as
his nightly forbidden peeps carter lighted a
cigarette and watched the willowy young lady
opposite emerge from the evening gown that
fell at her feet like an apricot-colored cloud

  she wore ravishing purple undies the
promise of a perfect  suggested by the frock
was more than revealed in the lingerie the
room was her bedchamber the girl liked to
pose in front of the bureau mirror like most
of her sex carter imagined she thought she
was tops anyway she enjoyed strutting and
posturing before the glass it was all very
frenchy very interesting and pulse-quicken-
ing to the onlooker

  sitting there carter watched every move
she made after she had posed enough to satis-
fy her vanity some of the filmy purple articles
of apparel swished over the back of a chair
the next minute she once more let the glass
reflect her charms

  what charms they were

  carter saw how beautifully her swan-like
neck flowed into her shoulders her bosom was
gorgeously molded large and firm her hips
were flat and ran into rounded thighs for the

rest her legs were twin poems of symmetry
and her feet tiny and high arched

  carter breathed heavily a girl like that
would be a decided ornament to the new floor
show he was putting on at the cheerio club
he wondered who she was what she was
evidently a person of some background and
taste from the looks of her apartments ap-
pointments he didnt even know her name
knew nothing except that this was the fourth
consecutive night she had disrobed in the light-
ed room with her shade up

  the blonde finally finished appraising her-
self she disappeared from the window when
she came into view again she was robed in a
filmy transparent nightie she pulled back the
pale pink coverlet on her carved wooden bed
bounced in between the sheets and stretched
out a slender arm toward the wall switch out
went the light and the show was over

  carter made himself a highball and drank
it slowly the girl was getting under his skin
he laughed at himself--he the broadway-
wise stage director and producer getting all
het up over a girl who wore purple undies and
posed in front of a mirror it was ridiculous
absurd it made him feel like a ten year old
boy peeking under a neighbors window shade
yet for what he had seen he had canceled two
appointments to get back to the apartment at
eleven oclock

  im nutsy as hell carter told himself
then he added but all the same i like being
this way

  after that he laughed finished his drink and
went to bed to dream all night about a blonde
siren with round soft curves and skin like
glimmering marble

  for three more nights that went on finally
on the fourth afternoon carter took a walk
around the block the apartment house that
backed up on the court opposite his own bache-
lor suite was an expensive building it was all
very de luxe from the doorman in livery to
the elevator operators in gold-braided uni-
forms



  carter got one of the lift pilots aside and
slipped him a buck

  tell me something he urged the rear
apartment on the fourth floor-whos the
tenant 

  the one he asked slipped the dollar in his
pocket and grinned

  i guess you mean miss cherry mason
blonde gal swell looker with big blue eyes
some of this and lots of that

  correct tell me all you know about her

  the elevator operator thought hard

  well shes been here for the last couple of
months shes a model-works downtown in
one of them cluck-an-soot parlors shes way
back on the rent and i wouldnt be surprised
if the landlord streeted her any day now any-
thing else mister

  carter shook his head

  thatll do thanks

  at eleven that night the light in the bedroom
across the court went on cherry mason hove
into view this time she wore a negligee with
very little underneath it carter knew that be-
cause at every step the thin covering parted
revealing interesting disclosures she was
smoking a cigarette and she seemed tired and
listless she sat on the edge of the bed her
chin propped up in the palm of one pink hand
finally she mashed the cigarette out and stifled
a yawn then she began to comb the lustrous
gold hair that glittered like a brazen flame

  there was a telephone convenient to car-
ters reach he dialed the number he had
looked up in the directory distantly he heard
the phone ring in the apartment he was star-
ing into the girl put down her comb and
picked up the telephone on a bench near the
vanitv

  hello

  her voice was quiet rich with a silvery
note jack carter thrilled to the sound of it

  miss mason

  yes who is this

  oddly carter felt his breath catch in his
throat

  miss mason i wonder if i could see you
tonight its on a rather important matter its
also personal cant be discussed over the wire
my name is carter and i live in the apartment
house directly back of you

  there was a pause

  ill be glad to see you at any time mr
carl er

  fine he yelped ill be right over

 when he pressed her bell with an un-
 steady finger and the door opened he found
 she had changed from the negligee to a little
 blue silk dress she didnt wear stockings but
 her feet were tucked in high-heeled slippers
 at close range she was even more pulse quick-
 ening exciting and desirable than she had
 been across the well of the court

 wont you come in 

 carter found himself in a small but charm-
 ing living room an interior decorator had
 undoubtedly been turned loose in it warm
 tones of gold and sepia blended artistically
 they looked at each other curiously carter
 smiled

 wonder what im up to

 she shrugged

 of course im curious

 im the original white haired boy he
 explained i visit young ladies in financial dis-
 tress and help them out of holes

 really

 her tone grew a little frosty carter grinned
 for instance if you were behind in your
 rent all youd have to do is give me the nod-
 and your back bills-and theyd be paid in the
 morning get the idea

 her blue eyes grew dreamy

 i think so and what would you want in
 return i mean how would i pay the debt
 off

 suppose we have a drink and ill tell you
 i took the liberty of bringing over a couple of
 bottles of champagne glasses please

 he opened and poured the wine she lost
 some of her reserve after the first portion of
 the effervescent straw-colored fluid

 i love the grape she confessed now i
 am more in the mood to hear your proposition
 you pay my back rent and what do i do

 carter went over and sat on the arm of
 her chair

 let me drop in and see you once in awhile
 at eleven oclock

 she looked up at him

 is that all

 every bit simple eh

 too simple must have a string on it why
 do you want to see me once in awhile at
 eleven 

 because carter said i enjoy looking at
 beaumful things

 youre an artist

 after a fashion

 they finished the bottle of champagne
 cherry masons cheeks glowed with warm



soft color she became more animated stimu-
lated she went over to the couch on the other
side of the room stretched out among its huge
deep pillows and looked at him through half-
closed eyes

  that sounds like a fair deal i think ill
accept it youll find my overdue rent bill in
the drawer of that little desk over there
carter followed directions and put the bill
in his pocket then he went to the couch and
dropped downbeside her it might have been
the champagne or a change in the weather but
lie suddenly began to feel warm it was a de-
licious kind of warmth it began in the vicinity
of his heart and spread artfully through him
stirring his pulses and putting his nerves on
edge

  close beside her he could see her intense
loveliness and catch the subtle drift of her
perfume her long lashes made shadows on
her cheeks and he wondered if she had been
named because of her lips they were like two
ripe red cherries

  youre the prettiest girl ive seen in months
and months he told her huskily what do
you do for a living 

  her expression turned mocking

  im a society deb my real name isnt
mason at all its claythorne im cicily clay-
thorne of the  park avenue bar harbor
and newport

  carter nodded and laughed

  and im young sonny vandergould of
westbury tuxedo and southampton i own a
dozen yachts and a string of polo ponies im
societys favorite bachelor

  they both laughed and carter edged closer
to her

  how about that other bottle of sparkling
water

  she shook her blonde head

  i dont think it would be wise i think per-
haps youd better go its past my bedtime

  i know it

  at that she sat up and peered at him
  how dyou know-

  its a secret let it ride and tell me some-
thing frankly are you in love with anyone
no why

  because carter stated taking her in his
arms youre going to be in love with me
beginning here and now

  she struggled a little but when she saw how
strong and determined he was she relaxed with
a sigh she was wonderfully soft and tempting
in his arms she was as cuddly as a kitten and

as sleek her little half hearted struggle car-
ried them both down among the cushions it
took carter a couple of minutes to find and
fasten his lips to hers

  the kiss was more intoxicating than any
champagne he had ever tasted it sent a stream
of fire streaking through him that was its
effect on him but on her it was entirely differ-
ent instead of flaming madly to its magic
she went suddenly limp with a throaty ex-
clamation she sank all the way down on the
couch gazing up at him with half parted lips
and eyes that were deeply lighted by an inner
glow

  her blonde hair spread out fan-wise and
a pulse in her throat beat with quickened regu-
larity carter urged himself closer to her her
unstockinged legs were cool to his touch her
dimpled knees trembled when his hand covered
them still she made no protest remained im-
movable when in a little frenzy of ardent emo-
tion carter held her in his grip before his
inner vision floated a picture -- the same
picture he had seen nightly at eleven it
was hard to believe he was actually there
beside her on the couch instead of in his
darkened lounge room watching from a dis-
tance her charms were maddening tempta-
tions he wanted to feast upon them like a
hungry man at a banquet board but how to
do it how to achieve his purpose in a swoon
of kisses and embraces he knew enough
about her sex to understand love was like a
game of bridge you could lead your best suit
but sometimes it was trumped

  cherry cherry i love you

  her blue eyes opened like those of a child
at dawn

  perhaps youd better go now jack theres
a key on top of the desk take it and come
back tomorrow night at eleven-

  no i want to hold and kiss you now

  she pushed him away

  tomorrow night-

  vainly he tried to capture the excitement
and romance of the past moments but she
wouldnt yield or surrender all she did was
keep her lips shielded and his hands away from
the expanse of her wonderful legs finally she
slipped from his tight hold hurried to the
desk and brought him back the key

  here-take it-tomorrow night she said
throatily

  carters theatrical experience was suffi-
cient to tell him the drama had ended tempor-
arily he put the key in his pocket shook him-


self and leaned to kiss her she stood on tip-
coe offering her scarlet mouth

  tomorrow night do me a favor he
pleaded just one little favor

  whats that

  wear that gorgeous negligee instead of the
dress

  her eyes widened

  how did you know-

  but carter wasnt answering any questions
he laughed kissed her again and reluctantly
let himself out of the apartment

  the next day he went around like a man in
a trance at the cheerio club where rehearsals
were in progress for the new floor show he
was inattentive thoughtful and retrospective
when the man directing the dance routines
brought up a trio of pretty girls for his in-
spection he had to speak twice to get carters
ear

  i say boss how do you like the gambs on
these fillies some assortment of daisy-stems
huh  and can they wave em

  carter looked at them without much inter-
est

  nice very nice he said absently

  how about taking a slant at their shapes
if you want they can go inside and undress
he grinned significantly but carter shook
his head

  never mind i can see theyre very pulchri-
tudinous put them to work give em a job
the boss must be losing his grip the
dancing instructor murmured as he turned
away come on gals i wont disappoint you
he wont look but i will in here-

  to carter the afternoon and evening seemed
a hundred years long he had dinner at the
cafe two arts and to kill time until eleven
picked out the best picture on the stem and saw
it twice

  it was exactly five minutes of the ap-
pointed hour when carters taxi whirled up
to the front of the apartment where cherry
mason lived he flung the driver a two dollar
bill jumped out and went into the building as
the elevator took him up to the fourth floor
he began to get last nights thrills again they
coursed through him like tiny electrical cur-
rents that tingled bewitchingly the elevator
operator was a new man he didnt speak to
carter and carter didnt speak to him the
operator merely said fourth floor and slid
open the fireproof door

  the key she had given carter was like fire

high up in the tyrol section there is a
town called inverness a rambling inn
glares at the surrounding country from
its higher vantage point and the town itself
spills out over the mountainside in the season
inverness is lively with tourists british tour-
ists who come armed with overshoes and um-
brellas  american tourists who laugh their way
over the stern face of the alps french tour-
ists who come with many children and much
clumsy luggage italian tourists interested in
intrigue and good cooking inverness is the
meeting place for the adventurers of the world
without being as blatant as monte carlo or as
dirty as cairo

  but even inverness had never seen anything
li-e the woman whose low powerful motor
stopped in front of the inn one particularly
lovely day in early june

  the two men on the balcony watched her
progress from the door of the car to the door
of the inn

  the younger of the two whistled under his
breath his companion looked at him slyly

  not for you carter the older man ad-
vised leave her alone a woman as lovely
as that is bound to have a very old very
jealous husband and even the american consul
can do very little in affairs of this type

  but have you ever seen anything so beau-
tiful carter wells asked his friend i-its
breath taking its-why its positively phe-
nomenal tell me julien do you know the
lady

  slightly julien roibeux murmured i
also know enough to advise you to flee from
those remarkable charms

  even the ancient clerk widened his eyes as
the woman approached the desk yes ma-
dame he was bowing and scraping for this
was the wife of the great monsieur antoine
bruex whose fortune was as enormous as his
face was ugly

  the womans honey colored hair was all
but hidden by the tight little hat she wore she
was gowned all in white with the lines of her
frock modeled so perfectly to the lines of her

figure that it was difficult to tell where one
stopped and the other began

  taller than average she had a regal
carriage with the rounded shoulders swinging
clear of the rib structure and the hips held
firmly as she walked like most well bred
europeans she walked from the hips down
the upper torso being straight and motionless
this habit gave her a gliding appearance fre-
quently seen in the strides of professional ath-
letes or remarkable dancers

  the soft line of the breasts remained per-
fect as she walked and not a wrinkle of her
gown was discernible

  i-i beg your pardon mademoiselle car-
ter wells strctched out a restraining hand
my name is  

  she looked at him and her black-fringed
grey eyes were coolly insolent he saw she
had the high cheek bones of the slav the tiny
little chin and the ruby red full lips of her fel-
low-countrywomen a breath-takingly lovely
woman

  i think you have made the mistake she
informed him her voice while not accented
had a slight furriness around the consonants
but he could not place the intonation german 
he doubted it certainly not french italian
not with that coloring of course-danish
how stupid of him not to have known i do
not know you nor do i care to know you she
swept by him but he was so enchanted by her
loveliness that her rebuff scarcely registered

  so you will not take the advice of a friend
hein juliens mocking voice interrupted car-
ters dreams but since you seem to be so
curious about the lady i shall tell you what i
know come we shall have an aperitif and
you can get whatever satisfaction you wish
out of the story i shall tell you

  the lady was not always so beautiful jul-
ien remarked when at last they seated hcm-
selves on one of the many terraces in fact
as a young girl she was more awkward thin
most you know how these jeitne filies are al-
most coltish in their stupidity her name was
dael pauvlo and she came of simple honest


people whose only ambition was to some day
get enough money to return to their native
home in finland dael was brought up in
lyons and later was sent to paris where she
was apprenticed to a very famous milliner

  i know the rest of the story carter in-
terrupted there she was discovered by a
wealthy old man who made her his wife-and
behold she spends her vacations at inverness

  jllien laughed not quite as simple as
that it is true monsieur bruex met her fell
in love with her-offered her marriage but
there was another boy

  enter the love interest carter murmured
a poor but honest lad who wanted to do
right by our nell but couldnt afford to

  more or less the narrator mused the
boy was wealthy also but he was affianced
to another girl such a marriage would unite
two of the largest fortunes in france he did
the next best thing for he set dael up in a
magnificent establishment there were motors
and cars and jewels the association lasted
even after his marriage

  but monsieur bruex is a clever man he
knew that one of two things would happen
either dael would some day be consumed with
such an overpowering love for the boy that
she would demand all his time-a thing he
could never give her for he knew his wifes
family were essential to his business success
or she would tire of being tucked away in the
background of his life in either case she
would turn to monsieur bruex this happened
of course she left the other boy on the night
his first son was born feminine vanity is a
oeculiar thing is it not she married monsieur
bruex

  very interesting and thats the secret sor-
row of the lady in white

  three years ago she learned that the boys
marriage was desperately unhappy we have
had quite a time of it in paris you know the
vast fortune had dwindled to almost nothing
the child had proved to be a wastrel-although
he is still but a little boy-the wife became acri-
monious and -sour so dael out of her huge
resources attempted to straighten out the af-
fairs of her farmer lover the association now
reopened upon a basis of maturity and grati-
tude quickly developed into a wild passionate
affair    and for five blessed days dael and
her lover meet here five little short days in
the course of every year it is for this reason
that you must not trouble her

  carter was staring at the man you
mean she has the nerve to come here-where
everybody knows her-and carry on like
that 

  like what juliens brow wrinkled dis-
tastefully at the tone of the others voice
have you seen anything unpleasant or cheap
take place

  no but she has just arrived when does
the boy friend put in an appearance

  that i do not know he may be here now
-he may come tomorrow nobody has ever
seen anything other than madame enjoying a
rather quiet vacation-and the boy tired and
subdued enjoying a typical business mans
holiday they nod when they pass he climbs
frequently in the course of his short stay she
lounges on the balcony sometimes in the eve-
ning they take a short stroll 

  then how do you know

  because sometimes-when they think no
one is noticing them-they look at each other
across a dining room across the lobby across
a counter-and in that look are all the an-
swers to all the longing questions now go
away and dont bother her julien rose and
strode through the doorway carters eyes
followed him wonderingly crazy emotional
people these french the american told him-
self imagine getting all steamed up over a
minor affair new york reeked with that sort
of thing and nobody paid any attention to it

  he had no intention of withdrawing from
the lists of madames followers of course
and now juliens slightly misty sentimentality
had added a certain interest to the affair he
would meet-and conquer-the icy dael and
prove conclusively that love is pretty much a
matter of financial expediency and geographi-
cal propinquity

  but this was easier said than done the lady
surrounded herself with a high barrier of si-
lence there was in her manner a complete in-
difference to the charms of the young amer-
ican which he found more difficult to conquer
than an active hatred

  she was seated in the summer house one
afternoon when he joined her

  you are very persistent monsieur she
told him gravely

  you are very beautiful madame he re-
plied equally gravely i assure you i am not
in the habit of thrusting my attentions upon
any one who shows the disinclination for my
company that you have shown but i must
know you it is imperative



    and now you are going to tell me that you
 have fallen madly in love with me i suppose
 her voice was mocking but her eyes twinkled
 with amusement

    he considered her statement for a moment
 no he told her slowly i havent fallen in
 love with you-but you are the most interest-
 ing woman ive ever met in my life and i re-
 fuse to be snubbed

    so i see and is this common in your coun-
 try-to annoy women

   im not annoying you he protested
 anyway you are interested in me and you
 know it

    she laughed then a light carefree gay
 little laugh you are quite right she told him
 ruefully but i did not expect such frank-
 ness

    he grinned at her admission then per-
 haps you will dine with me tonight

    but i cannot she protested tonight  
 however i shall be free-shall we say about
 nine-thirty

    it was a funny thing he never saw her with
 anyone if she were having an affair he told
 himself bitterly she must be doing it by re-
 mote control she dined alone there was no
 stranger in the hotel who could possibly be
 yher lover sometimes she took a stroll with
 julien-but she also walked with a funny
 little englishman and she was seen having
 tea with a dour scot certainly none of the
 people there at the hotel were present because
 of a sentimental rendezvous maybe and this
 idea had been growing in carters brain for
 some time the man had failed her this year
 perhaps that was the reason that she was un-
 bending in the direction of the visiting ameri-
 can he shrugged indifferently whatever the
 reason he felt a surge of victory at the memo-
 ry of her promised appointment that evening

    promptly at the dot of nine-thirty car-
 ter presented himself at her door her low
 and husky voice bade him enter her apart-
 ment had evidently been furnished to order
 a low-ceilinged room that was oblong in shape
 and the wall opposite the door was comprised
 of six french windows the low balcony be-
 yond was banked with flowers and beyond
 their moonlit leaves was the majestic glory of
 the alpine peaks

    dael did not rise when he entered but per-
 mitted him to approach her her outstretched
 hand drew him down until he was seated on
 the hassock by her side the chaise longue on
 which she reclined was upholstered in a deep

coral satin forming a striking background for
her own golden beauty

  i cannot tell you how grateful i am
he began stroking one slim white hand be-
neath the diaphanous haze of her amber negli-
gee he could see the delicate flesh tints of that
perfect body and the thought of that alabaster
warmth sent the blood surging through his
pulses

  she smiled a slow lazy smile as one smiles
upon the antics of a rather dear but unimport-
ant puppy

  i am a frank woman monsieur she told
him simply and like all women i have a
price 

  he looked at her curiously for a moment
but the expression in her eyes left no question
in his mind he felt a cold chill of shock at the
mercenary words

  you are jesting he protested running an
index finger up the inner surface of a forearm
the skin was wonderfully soft to his touch
for a moment her fingers clung to his convuls-
ively then as though she were thrusting all
other thoughts from her mind she permitted
those pink-tipped hands to relax in his

  i am not jesting monsieur she told him
gravely people think i am a wealthy woman
that alas is no longer true my husband w ho
arrives here tomorrow has been more than
kind and generous to me now he needs my
full support ah not money you understand
but in time in affection in loyalty this is
the last time i shall have a vacation by myself
and this is the last night of my last vacation

  i see none of this made sense to carter
but the fact that she did not pull away when
he leaned over to kiss a silken shoulder lightly
thrilled him beyond words so instead of
taking leave of the boy friend you call in the
marines-represented by myself-and scatter
your favors a last reckless fling i take it

 i

  he knew his words hurt her and he was
glad for she had besmirched a dream the es-
sence of which he would not dare admit had
she been anyone else had she been less beauti-
ful less intriguing less glorious he could have
forgiven her but she was so absolutely what
every woman should be so completely the epi-
tome of every mans dreams that he felt gyped
at discovering the clay feet

  she winced but her eyes met his bravely
what you think is nothing to me she told
him but what you do is everything to me
this evening shall be yours-but i warn you

the dough boy

by

ken cooper

it was mrs reginald barkers theory-as
it is the theory of every widow in reduced
circumstances with a daughter to marry
off-that a girl could just as easily fall in love
with a rich man as she could with a poor

  in fact elsa she said addressing the
blonde twenty year old object of mrs bark-
ers thoughts a wealthy man can give you all
the comforts of life she waggled a plump
finger and let me tell you nothing spoils
wedded bliss so much as lack of comfort why
when your father-

  ive heard that a dozen times mother
elsa snapped pettishly must i hear it again 
ill do as you wish it doesnt really matter to
me if you want to go to pineville for the
summer well go to pineville she drew a deep
breath swelling the young nubile breasts un-
der the bodice of her dress but i warn you i
wont be nudged into marrying some lisping
son of a multi-millionaire oil magnet just be-
cause you want to lounge around wearing a
french negligee and eating three dollar a
pound candy and thats that

  elsa tossed her blonde head vanished from
the living room of the modest barker apart-
ment mrs barker sniffled dabbed at her nose
with a handkerchief mrs barker was always
sniffling and dabbing at her nose with a hand-
kerchief when she wasnt eating chocolates
and discussing reducing diets

  in her room elsa slammed the door shut
behind her sat down on the bed pineville
she grunted mr depuyster-puyster-piff-
sniffle and all the rest of the piffsniffles she
sighed oh whats the use elsa leaned back
on the bed flexed her muscles she looked
down the length of her trimly curved body
sometimes she almost wished she were flat-
chested knock-kneed and cross-eyed yes and
hare-lipped maybe if her breasts werent high
and round and her hips succulently curved and
her thighs like polished ivory pillars her
mother wouldnt think she was such a swell
prospect in the marriage mart

  elsa closed her deep blue eyes dreamed
of a paradise uninfested by mercenary people

why was everything given a money value
love affection marriage why couldnt her
mother let her meet some nice boy in the natu-
ral course of things have her romance get the
most out of it no it would be pineville with
its ultra-ultra rich their lap dogs their limou-
sines

  and pineville it was as elsa knew it would
be the moment her mother mentioned it mrs
barker had the munificent sum of  in the
bank the last of the money mr barker had
left elsa had  in a christmas fund which
she drew out at her mothers request

  that makes  mrs barker said of
course it isnt much but i think we can man-
age well stay at the miramar it isnt the
best hotel in pineville but its one of the best
they charge  a day per person

  elsa couldnt resist the opportunity youll
have to work fast wont you mother sixty
dollars a day only gives us two weeks
elsa reprovingly please dont discuss
it in that manner mrs barker began to snif-
fle dab at her nose why when your father
was-

  ive heard that one too mother hadnt
we better start packing

  the train trip to pineville was uneventful
naturally to maintain the illusion of grandeur
an illusion backed by  mrs barker in-
sisted on riding in the parlor car fortunately
for elsa her mother fell asleep over a box
of chocolates and a movie magazine annoyed
with the green plush and white head rests of
the parlor car elsa slipped out of her seat
headed for the day coach smoking car at the
end of the train

  there she slid into a seat curled her
slim legs up lit a cigarette and puffed in
something akin to contentment she was ad-
miring the rolling country side and thinking
of how to avoid meeting all the stuffed shirts
her doting mother was bound to dig up when
a voice sounded at her shoulder

  may i have a light please

  elsa turned looked up into the smiling face
of an exceptionally handsome young man he


 had bright gray eyes a nice mouth and a firm
 chin she held up her cigarette he lit his
 puffed in

 going far he questioned

 pineville elsa said

 really so am i mind if i sit here i al-
 ways like to talk to people on trains funny
 that way

 elsa moved over she watched his eyes
 glance hurriedly down the front of her body
 pausa a moment where her bosom jutted pro-
 vocatively that didnt bother her all men
 did that it was part of their make-up

 so youre going to pineville he said
 vacation 

 elsa swallowed hard er-no not ex-
 actly

 he crossed his legs the trousers of his
 linen suit were well wrinkled he didnt wear
 garters and his socks hung listlessly

 work

 er-yes sort of that was strangely the
 truth fortune hunting was work-hard de-
 testable work

 my names boyd arnold he said apro-
 pos of nothing at all i didnt get yours
 elsa smiled no i didnt give it to you
 its rose-rose smith

 swell place pineville he said lots of
 rich people go there

 do you like rich people

 he scowled not much most of them are
 snobs do you like them

 no decisively i detest them

 im going to the ccc camp near pine-
 ville he said quickly maybe on my nights
 off you and i could see each other huh
 elsa liked his fresh wholesomeness it was
 like eating cooling sherbet yes maybe we
 could

 he moved closer to her his leg touched
 hers where will you be i could drop you
 a line and tell you when im coming in would
 that be okay

 yes that would be fine ill be at the hotel
 miramar

 working there

 uh huh

 his face glowed you know i was won-
 dering what to do in pineville-i mean at the
 ccc camp this sort of takes a load off
 my mind can i call you rose and will you
 call me boyd

 yes of course

  he touched her arm how about coming
out on the platform its cooler

  elsa agreed she wondered what her mother
would say if she knew this chance acquaintance
was already addressing her by her assumed
given name escorting her out to the platform
holding her arm mrs barker would in all
probability have a fit and elsa reflected her
mothers fits were fits with a capital f

  out on the platform the ccc recruit
waxed loquacious he was becoming a ccc
boy he said because there wasnt much else
to do jobs were scarce and all that elsa
agreed yes jobs were scarce did he think
hed like the work yes he thought he would
especially now that he had something to which
he might look forward on his nights off

  what does one do in pineville of a night
elsa questioned

  oh i guess there must be a movie house
or maybe a place where they serve beer and
you can dance or else you can just walk
around do you like to walk 

   elsa nodded i do quite a lot

  sudddenly the train lurched as it went
around a curve elsa went off balance straight
into the arms of the young man he caught
her held her the position was perfect for a
kiss her head was thrown back and her red
lips were parted a bare inch or two away from
his mouth his arms circled her waist and her
bosom seemed to bore into his chest they
held that position for a long moment then
quickly as though opportunity was knocking
and would not return again he kissed her
not just a plain ordinary peck hardly it
was a full warm kiss with his arms tightening
and pressing her curved body close to him

  when he released her they were both
flushed i-im sorry he gasped i-i
really didnt mean to but-but-

   elsa fiddled with a stray strand of hair i
understand she said quietly if the truth were
to be known she would have raised no ob-
jection if he repeated the presumptuous act
yes repeated it again and again for the first
time in all her life she was tingling her
breath was hard to control and her pulses
pounded a pleasantly warm wave rolled over
her

   this was a nice state of affairs she thought
here she was falling in love with a good look-
ing young member of the unemployed whose
future was as nebulous as the big dipper on
a cloudy night who unless an economic mira-
cle occurred would be chopping trees and



building country roads until the end of time
or the arrival of a republican administration

  very pretty what with mrs reginald bark-
er peacefully asleep in the parlor car dreaming
no doubt of diamond tiaras and sable coats
and liveried chauffeurs

  it wasnt fair to her mother elsa decided
the least she could do was wait until they
reached pineville

  i-ill have to go now she stammered
it--its been nice meeting you and you must
get in touch with me

  he gripped her hand you arent mad be-
cause of what i did are you  he queried ob-
viously worried about the turn of affairs

  mad elsa would have liked to tell him
just how she felt to tell him how nice it was
to have his arms about her and his lips on
hers instead she smiled and squeezed his
fingers dont be silly of course im not
mad good-bye

  mrs barker awakened as elsa returned to
the parlor car she sat up with a start where
are we she gasped

  on a train elsa replied on a train
headed for pineville

  the train finally arrived at pineville
elsa fearful lest she might bump into her con-
quest delayed the debarkation as long as pos-
sible fortunately pineville was the last stop
on the line and they could take as long as they
liked

  elsa breathed easier when they reached the
hotel and were safe in the suite of two rooms
and bath mrs barker had reserved at  per
day they were nice rooms and a lovely bath
but elsa could think of a lot of things 
might buy to better advantage

  mrs barker tested the beds saw to the view
from the front windows hopped about the
place like a mother hen isnt this simply too
too impressing she gurgled

  elsa nodded wearily it was too too much
trouble to do anything else she stripped off
her traveling clothes stepped into the shower
that was one of elsas greatest pleasures-
showering she liked to watch the water cas-
cade off her breasts leaving little silver bubbles
on the tight-skinned globes

  refreshed she stretched out on one of the
beds garbed only in flimsy panties her
mother spied her gasped

  elsa havent you any shame

  elsa grinned do you see anything to be
ashamed of ill name fifty women whod give
their birthrights for this body

  mrs barker exhausted by the effrontery
of her one and only offspring dropped wearily
into a chair

  she wasnt so weary an hour or so later
when she descended into the lobby in fact
she was the essence of industry so much so
that at dinner she was able to present elsa to
mr and mrs edmund dekoven and their
son morton

  elsa smirked at morton he was tall
thin anaemic and banjo-eyed from entree to
dessert he discussed polo ponies until elsa
thought she was eating them after dinner
morton invited her to stroll down to the ten-
nis courts she was about to refuse when a
look from her mother warned her that refusal
was sucide

  at the tennis courts morton did not talk
about tennis what did he talk about youre
right polo ponies later that night as elsa and
mrs barker ascended to their room the latter
opened the door

  wait a minute elsa panted see if there
are any polo ponies under the beds

  mrs barker added to her circle of ac-
quaintances in rapid order the following day
one by one all eligible sons were dragged to
elsa for introduction they were prize pack-
ages one of them collected postage stamps
his father was a multi-millonaire gold mine
owner within a short time elsa was all ready
to slap a couple of air mail stamps on his nose
and send him to alaska

  the following morning there was a letter
from boyd arnold will be in tonight it
said looking forward to seeing you eight
oclock in front of the hotel

  luck was with elsa that evening mrs
barker was invited to visit the estate of a
friend of the dekovens elsa shooed her off
before eight donned her cheapest cotton print
dress and waited outside the hotel

  boyd arrived five minutes later attired in
the same sack suit he had worn on the train
he took her hands squeezed them feelingly

  swell to see you his face lit up and his
eyes sparkled

  elsa compared him with morton of the polo
ponies edgar of the postage stamps and perci-
val of the nothing at all pie was so different
pauper or no pauper he had what it took to
set elsas heart to beating frantically

  he suggested a walk the boys were tell-
ing me of a swell park near here i think we
can find it if we take a carriage




  elsa objected carriages cost money

  ive got a little come on

  they hiked a carriage drove out beyond
the town limits to what was part park and part
rustic picnic ground boyd paid off the driver
took elsas arm

  the air was heavy with the sweet pungent
scent of honeysuckle a faint breeze blew in
from the east just enough to kill the humidi-
ty-

  nice here isnt it he queried breathing
in audibly swell scent

  elsa was thrilling to the touch of his fingers
on her bare arm she wondered if he would
move them just a few inches higher to where
soft flesh curved out in a firm gelatinous hil-
lock

  yes it is nice she murmured

  they walked through the park for some
time finally boyd suggested resting on one of
the rustic benches elsa sat close to him her
thigh almost touching his he moved away
something was wrong she wriggled close to
him again and he moved away

  how do you like the work at the camp
she asked

  he shrugged not bad

  elsa moved closer again for a moment
their thighs touched then he moved away

  whats the matter boyd she questioned

  he hung his head nothing

  you dont seem very sociable tonight

  he looked up suddenly his eyes were
glowing i-i dont want to get in wrong
he gasped i cant trust myself with you i
-im crazy about you and-

  the moon came up over the serrated edge
of the horizon like a great silver ball the
night was pungent with sweetness everything
was right for romance

  elsa dropped her hand on his arm i wont
be mad boyd she whispered i-i wont
mind if you kiss me and-

  she never finished the sentence his mouth
covered her lips and his hands raced over the
curves of her body making her quiver elsa
touched his cheeks ran her fingers through
his brown hair she went limp

  elsa was reading in bed when her mother
returned mrs barker was all agog her avoir-
dupois shook like so much jelly

  elsa darling she gasped i met the most
delightful people the wentworths of new
york newport news pineville florida-

  and points east elsa added

  mrs barker ignored the causticism went
 and they have a son he wasnt in to-
night but i saw his picture hes positively
stunning and of course the dekovens raved
about you as they naturally would and so
mr  mrs wentworth insisted that i bring
you out tomorrow night to meet their son
richard mrs barker paused for breath

  elsas heart sank she had made another
date with boyd for tomorrow night he was
going to sneak out of camp to meet her she
knew better than to buck her mother it might
be possible to make both boyd wasnt to meet
her until ten

  at eight the following evening mrs
barker and elsa in a hired limousine drove
into the wentworth estate a lackey answered
the door escorted them into a sumptuous
drawing room mrs wentworth white-haired
and fluttery greeted them

  oh you are beautiful she gushed at elsa
richard will be surprised i had such a time
keeping him in tonight she turned to the
butler tell master richard i wish to see
him

  elsa had a faint idea of what master rich-
ard would look like he probably bred beetles
she sat on pins and needles waiting then the
portieres parted and a young man stepped into
the room elsas eyes bulged the young mans
eyes bulged but they both understood they
both knew why each of them had practiced
subterfuge

  hello rose he whispered when they
were introduced

  hello boyd she replied

  they were married within the week mrs
barker was lit up like a lighthouse she had
gitten her dough boy for elsa and all was
quiet on the matrimonial front

rawhide kisses

by
bobby barnes

the thing was incredible it hey didnt
beat men like that in this day and age
but it went on the whistle of the raw-
hide thongs wrapping themselves around a
slim straight figure in the courtyard right be-
neath her windows

  suzy couldnt stand it another minute al-
though shed been shut in her rooms two days
now rather than meet rod fane she had to
get down and make him stop the whipping of
the prisoner

  she tore open the office door and rushed in
and leaned against it panting

  rod fane sheriff of fanes cut saloon-
keeper and owner of everything in the tiny
village huddled in the valley looked up from
his ledgers and grinned unpleasantly as he
took in the sweet young figure huddled against
the scarred old door a dude girl she was this
suzy alcott and never had he had such a one
in his clutches

  his flaming glance swept over the rounded
figure tricked out in fringed buckskin shirt
thin silk blouse drawn tightly over straining
young breasts shining soft kid boots showed
bare knees between their tops and the white
fringed buckskin skirt

  brown curls redlighted tumbled about her
lace and stayed down the collar of her blouse
one curl even hid in the sweet white valley of
her bosom

  make them stop that awful beating mr
fane gasped suzy wetting her trembling
red mouth what has he done

  only killed a banker at painted post who
refused to lend him money drawled fane
he hasnt confessed yet but i reckon he
soon will or die

  suzy cleared the space between them
and leaned over the desk youve got to stop
it you can let them take him to painted
post and get his confession i cant stand it
having him beaten right under my window

  rawhide kisses we call them sweetheart
theres a kind id swop them for smiled
fane his gaze wandering over her figure

  you mean

  i meh you ride out with him tomorrow
night to painted post and he doesnt get
beaten any more itll cost you one kiss tonight
and plenty tomorrow night

  oh  couldnt wailed suzy

  no excuse me and ill tell them to let up
a little on the lashes make them farther be-
tween so hell last all night fane drawled
rising

  islo you wouldnt be so brutal gasped
suzy

  i reckon i would to get your promise to
let me kiss you fane said coldly but the
coldness did not extend to his eyes they were
hot and suzys clothes seemed to sear and
shrivel and fall off one by one until she stood
nude before that stripping burning glance

  all  all right i ll be what you want
me to be whispered suzy i cant stand any
more hes so young

  and i get the kiss now 

  as soon as you tell them to stop beating
him and that they are not to do it any more
and will only take one kiss tonight suzy
said faintly

  i could take all i want but i wont you
cant say i took you by force if anyone comes
snooping youll ride out with me peacefully
then you cant get me in trouble saying i as-
saulted you or any such truck fane keeps
his skirts clean

  yes yes get out there before they kill
him panted suzy

  fane went outside where his men had a
young fellow roped to a post quit it now
the girl gave in he said grinning take
him inside i ll ride out with him tomorrow
night and i dont ride alone he added with
a leer

  we did a good job she never got wise
we hit the post more than him laughed one
of the men stooping over the unconscious
figure huddled at the foot of the post the
first whack put him out but it didnt hurt him
   much

  fane went back in straight to the girl
at the window he gathered her into his arms


and dragged her hard against him as she tried
to strain back his thin mouth swooped over
her red one pushing enveloping smothering
her

  suzy went faint at his kiss but something
brought her back fanes hand pushing back
her curls going after one that had strayed too
far and forgetting to bring back his hand

  the office door crashed open and swearing
fane had to let suzy go

  she staggered back against the dirty win-
dow her hands flying to her torn blouse

  it was the deputy with the prisoner you
didnt say what to do with him whined the
deputy quailing beneath his boss blazing look

  take him up to the third floor and lock
him in roared fane

  suzy gathered up her trembling legs and
sped past the two men see you tomorrow
night she flung back and started up the
stairs as fast as she could go all weak and
sick as she felt

   it was the first good look she had had at the
prisoner but he was worth what he cost her

  his hair was like palest gold and waved
on his temples like a babys but he was tanned
and his mouth while tender was firm he
hadnt uttered a sound from the first blow
the blow that had knocked him down and
showed to one side of his temples a dark ugly
ridge

  he was the young owner of the silver cup
mine and had ridden in with fanes deputies
early this morning

  suzy gained her room and locked the door
it had a bar on it too and she dropped that
oh fane protected her all right he meant
no other man to have the girl he wanted

  she looked at the cruel slash in the moun-
tain which made the valley a tiny half mile
cup with frowning mountain cliffs all around
it it was the only way out or in and she had
come in searching for her brother and fane
had seen to it that she hadnt gone out his
men guarded the cut and let in and out just
those their boss- allowed to travel

  fane hadnt dared take suzy by force but
he had done his best to weaken her resistance
and now he had won by having a prisoner
beaten under her windows

  tomorrow night she would apparently go
willingly with fane out of the cut and w hen
people came hunting if they did thered be
witnesses enough to swear shed gone of her
own accord

   she heard the deputy fling the prisoner into

the next room it too had barred windows
like hers and strong locks

  the deputy rapped on her door keep an
eye on him miss fane says youre to be the
new missus and might as well begin helping
him by guarding the prisoner if he makes a
move call down to the office

  suzy opened the door give me the key
and ill dress his head

  aw i cant im riding to painted post
tonight to tell them ive got their prisoner
for them and i have to turn in the keys to the
boss

  supposing you forgot hes mighty ex-
cited over getting me he may forget to ask
you till youre gone wheedled suzy

  whats it worth to me to give them to
you the deputy asked bluntly

   a  a kiss asked suzy reflecting noth-
ing could be worse than fanes kiss

  the deputy stepped into her room his face
eager and suzy went meekly into his arms
her hands closing over the key well it wasnt
much better than fanes but she didnt scrub
her mouth till she had pushed the deputy out
the door when you come back  if you
havent told  she hinted

  ear pressed to the door she heard him
clatter out the door then ran to the window
and far below she saw him jump on his horse
and ride away he hadnt told for not half
an hour later she heard fane come up the
stairs and try the door to the prisoners room
then go away swearing

   well he cant get out till derby gets back
she heard him say and hes served his pur-
pose suzy

  what is it im going to bed suzy
snapped

  thought youd like to help celebrate he
called back

  no i want to be rested for tomorrow
night suzy said more gently

  then give me a kiss wheedled fane

  tomorrow night suzy said firmly and
heard him swear but he went downstairs

  his celebration was going hot by ten
oclock from all sounds then at eleven she heard
his men on the floor below putting him to bed
before they went back to their liquor

  suzy sighed with relief took the key and
let herself out of her room locked the door
after her and unlocked the door next to hers

  a lamp burned lowr and she made out the
young man stretched on the bed and went over
to him and put a soft cool hand on his head


 suffering much she asked

 he wakened with a start what no not
 at all what are you doing here

 a fellow prisoner suzy said bitterly i
 came to see if i could do anything for you
 no im not hurt except the tunk over the
 head strange they didnt seem to hit me at

all after that first hard blow he sat up and
found his cigarettes and lit one watching suzy
through the smoke

  suzy started why no of course they
didnt it was all a beautiful show for a suck-
er im the sucker you see fane has wanted
me but he hadnt the nerve to take me by force
so knowing me for a softie he faked that

flogging right under my windows i was a
sucker

  yes you were he wouldnt have dared
hurt me much hell pay for this much said
the young man gingerly feeling of the ridge
on his head but you    what are you doing
here

  came in through the cut hunting my
brother and fane has kept me here on one
excuse or another claiming to be hunting him
last night he admitted he hadnt searched
at all that he wanted to keep me here to-
night i promised he could take me out to the
cut tomorrow night theres no jp here and
he does mean to marry me suzy said bit-


terly and then she heard

  and you gave in because of me the
young man asked incredulously

  yes i never could stand suffering fane
found that out when i made one of his men
quit beating a puppy the other day this
gave him an excuse

  now what escape

  there isnt any escape besides i prom-
ised to ride out with him and i keep my prom-
ises you cant get away because his men
guard the cut

  i dont want to get away tomorrow there
will be officers here to tell fane what he al-
ready knows that i didnt kill the banker you
can ride out with us

  suzy shook her head i cant i prom-
ised even if he did make a sucker out of me i
couldnt live with myself afterwards if i broke
a promise

  why you soft little sap blazed the man
taking her by the shoulders and shaking her
he was mauling you plenty too when the
deputy brought me in

  yes suzy looked sick whats your
name i cant keep on calling you say all
night

  quinton leslie but all night you mean
you arent safe in your room

  suzy shook her head no i didnt mean
that im quite safe because hes been getting
himself dead drunk ever since i promised
hes out like a light but  she hesitated
getting scarlet  thought    well skip it
leslie took her hand and drew her down
beside him lets clear all this up supposing
i make them bring you to painted post  save
you in spite of yourself 

  id come back and keep my promise you
see my family has been a bunch of quitters i
swore id see anything through that i started
brother got in a mess and ran away i cleaned
that up and came after him to make him face
the music after this dad shot himself when
he got in debt mother had run off with an-
other man    couldnt face losing her lover
even for her family my big sis married a
rich old man rather than face poverty   
well im facing everything keeping my prom-
ises no matter what it costs

   why you swell little kid you leslie said
softly putting his arm around her shoulders
and giving her a hard hug what i wouldnt
give for a girl like you

  thats it suzy said very low i came
 i thought you might like me enough  

and afterwards when i was married to him
i could shut my eyes and make believe it was
someone nice    like you she looked down
color staining the back of her neck where the
curls fell away each side of her face and
strayed down the inside of her blouse

  i get it you want someone decent first
but that will only make it worse afterwards
and i might    well i might disappoint you
and not be nice youre a lovely little wild
rose    what is your name

  suzy alcott

  well youre pretty sweet suzy and i
might forget myself and not be so sweet
leslie said gravely

  suzy sighed ive been pretty brazen have
i not im not usually that way it was the
thought of fane when ive dreamed of   
well skip it il go back to my room

  stay here and talk leslie pushed her
head down on his shoulder id like to kiss
a game little sport 

  all right suzys long lashes fell and ex-
citement flamed in her eyes maybe she could
pull it off yet

  he bent and gently touched her lips and
found them warm and eager and responsive
they clung to his in an exciting way even
though they were slightly parted so his kiss
deepened and became something of fire and
madness

  he bent his head to kiss her throat and
found the inquisitive curl in the way and swept
it aside and saw revealed gleaming white skin
and kissed it instead and telt her shiver in his
arms then clung closer

  already leslie had forgotten he had not
meant to take the gift offered him the silk
blouse fell with the faintest whisper of regret
at leaving such loveliness and the creamy
buckskin skirt followed and suzys body shim-
mered and glowed through the silk and lace
chemise like a pink vase

  slim shiny boots fell with a thud that
should have wakened the drunken fane but
didnt suzys heart was beating so hard it
seemed everyone in the sordid building must
hear it and leslies was thudding against hers
even harder it seemed as though his heart
beats bruised her soft flesh but she hugged
the hurt harder to her as leslies lips flamed
against hers his hand traced the rounded
curves and made intriguing discoveries that
led to the lamp spluttering out with a final
outraged puff that filled the room with kero-


sene reek but the shadow on the cot never
noticed

  it was morning but there were no stirs in
the halls when suzy freed herself and began
dressing leslie was in the first heavy sleep
and did not hear and not until she was dressed
all but her boots did she stoop over and press
her mouth lingeringly over his he stirred a
little at that and reached for her but she slip-
ped out of reach and unlocked the door and
locked it again

  in her own room she slipped between cool
sheets that hugged her tired body agreeably
exit heaven and enter hell but shed have to-
day to dream

  now she knew shed been a fool to think
leslies caresses could make fanes agreeable
that she could shut her eyes and believe it was
leslie in whose arms she was

  she thought fleetingly of death that would
be easy but she was an alcott who saw things
through so shed make fane a good wife and
pray hed tire of her quickly and kick her out
for another girl hed had plenty

  there was a loud pounding on her door
and fanes voice and she wakened from a de-
licious mad dream to see the sun sliding rapid-
ly down the western sky

  you little devil wake up fanes jovial
voice said were riding out in an hour come
down and eat you cant live on love come
ready to ride

  suzy dressed and packed her saddlebags for
the first time in six weeks she was a slim boy
today in riding breeches boots and pullover
sweater and she also huddled on a big leather
coat before going downstairs

  fane was eating a belated meal and making
poor work of it after his drunk he grinned
as his glance licked over the bundled up figure
good girl all the more exciting for me any-
thing i dote on is having to strip a girl of a
lot of bungling clothes

  suzy sank hastily into a chair cheeks scar-
let and began eating and found she was half
starved after a days fast 

  say youre a good sport suzy fane
said admiringly ill be good to you i swear
well get the fellows ready derby and well
be on our way fane strode to the door
your horse is waiting come as soon as you
are through

  suzy finished choking over the last bites
but downing them for she was going to need
her strength there was no escape for her
now leslies friends had not come as he ex-

pected he couldnt prevent her from keeping
her word if he wanted to

  leslie was on a horse that was tied at the
hitching rail and his wrists were manacled
and a chain fastened the cuffs to the saddle
suzys eyes flashed then she went all weak for
he looked up and saw her in the window and
his whole soul was in his smile

  hurriedly suzy went out snapping the strap
of her sombrero under her chin

  derby the deputy stopped her you prom-
ised me plenty when i got back and i find you
riding out to get spliced to fane he growled

  can i help it suzy asked scornfully
id have kept my promise to you if fane
hadnt forced me to go with him

  yeah i guess you would i know how he
fooled you into promising well maybe youll
get sick of his maulings derby went out and
sprang into his saddle and jerked the reins back
over his mounts head

  suzy went out too and let fane lift her
to the saddle he straightened her feet in the
stirrups and drew a slow hand up her calf
his eyes burning over her face as he did so
she sat like a statue looking straight ahead
and fane with a laugh got into his own sad-
dle and started the little party out he and suzy
in the lead where the road was narrow the
deputy and prisoner behind

  they went through the cut at a lope and
suzy shivered when she saw the fast sliding
sun theyd be at painted post in another hour
and fane wouldnt wait till morning to hunt
up a jp to make her his

  leslie was looking at her when she looked
back once and she did not look again for fear
fane would notice something and do hurt to
her sweetheart

  fane rode close to her side and lifted suzy
out of the saddle up in front of his i saw him
looking at you he said softly threateningly
i wanted to spill him down the cliff for it
i will if he doesnt look out itd make things
a lot easier im likely to go up as it is for false
arrest and beating him ive a good notion
to crowd his horse off the trail

  silly suzy tried to say lightly let him
live and well go so far away he cant catch
up with us of her own free will she settled
back in fanes arms and when his hand slid
over her shoulder and followed the line of her
throat she restrained the shiver and said noth-
ing

  he was breathing fast now and bent and
kissed her hard his hand closing on her soft


upper arm suzy grew faint under that kiss

  posse coming boss growled derby in
warning

  fane swore and put suzy back on her own
horse and glared down the trail women with
them he muttered then swore more wildly
than ever i never thought theyd track us to
the cut derby

  derby looked and swore too at the sight
of the two women riding with the sheriff of
painted post then he swung his horse about
and beat it back up over the hogback and
fane after that identification did the same

  what ever gasped suzy

  looks as though their ball and chains had
caught up with them gritted leslie spurring
up beside suzy i could kill you for letting
him touch you

  he was going to shove your horse over the
cliffs edge suzy said sickly i had to get
his mind off that

the two hard looking dames after a yell
spurred their horses after the vanishing men

  those women are the deserted wives of
those two tough hombres grinned the sheriff
hunting and finding the key to leslies shack-
les reckon thats the last well ever see of the
sheriff of the cut and his deputy whos the
little lady mr leslie

  miss alcott suzy alcott my future wife
leslie said proudly

  pleased to meet you maam mebbe youre
some kin to young don alcott who made a
little strike up our way and telegraphed for his
sister

  hes my brother suzy said joyously

  well itll be a right pleasant reunion it
wasnt much of a strike but hes the kind will
make others and if he has a sister like you
married to the owner of the silver cup mines
it dont need to be much of a strike beamed
the sheriff

  why not ride back and tell alcott his sister
will- arrive sometime tomorrow forenoon
hinted leslie tell him shes been hunting
for him

  why land of goshen mr leslie just ride
along and tell him yourself er    er   may-
be the young lady is tuckered    come to no-
tice she does look meachin ill leave my
pack pony with stuff and blankets sos you
can make camp and have some grub to last
you till you get in want i should go after
fane and fetch him in for making a false ar-
rest wonder why he did it

he needed me to help him along some of


his own deviltry no let him go hes proba-
bly on the prod two leaps ahead of those
dames leslie said generously

  the sheriff wheeled his horse and set
out after his posse and the two watched him
cut out and hobble a pack horse and leave him
behind

  what did you tell him wed be in tomor-
row for  suzy demanded i want to see my
brother and 

  in a hurry leslie asked coming to her
side and sliding his arms around her and lift-
ing her from her horse tomorrow therell
be so much excitement what with my adven-
ture and your coming and our wedding well
hardly have a free minute till dark but now
heres a nice green secluded canyon food
horses solitude tonight therell be plenty of
stars and heres thick pine needles just made
for meachin young ladies he pulled suzy
gently down on the warm brown needles his
smile daring her to rebel

  suzy sighed good-bye freedom she said
sadly and lay back her arms under her head
young red mouth smiling

  leslie leaned over her and coaxed out of its
hiding place the fat curl which always usurped
the sweetest kiss pot and put his mouth there
then trailed his lips further up suzys throat
to her mouth

  suzy found she didnt need a pillow half as
much as she needed to put her arms around
leslies neck and when he began counting off
the buttons on her breeches rich man poor
man beggarman thief doctor lawyer mer-
chant chief tinker tailor soldier sailor rich
man and the last button was rich man he
thought he was rich indeed to find so much
sweet skin hidden by the buttons

  the soft green canyon became a place of
caught breaths and soft sighs and a pinon
squirrel came out to see why it was so quiet
there was no doubt about her being an old
maid for she whisked back with a chatter of
shocked fury

  secrets

our face is an oasis	 

 in the desert of my heart	

     your words are tinkling music

         in the discord of my life

your eyes your lips your laughter

each is idolized apart----

but i wouldnt think of telling
you

because you are my wife

   by
   clinton harcourt

at eleven oclock the queen of france-
havre to new york-arrived at pier
 at twelve oclock young jerry
porter one of the ships most entertaining
passengers had his first drink on broadway
for a year at one oclock jerry telephoned
the abbey apartments and at two oclock he
stood before the front door of a penthouse
suite there

  is miss mathis in miss helen mathis
he asked politely in case she wants to know
who it is just tell her her fiance is back from
paris she might be interested

  five minutes later jerry got up to greet
helen for a year he had thought about her-
dreamed about her red tempting lips visioned
her ebony dark hair mentally ran eager hands
over the curves and contours of her lush young
body in his paris studio where he had studied
art so diligently his one thought had been of
the girl he had left behind in the states

  jerry

  helen

  they faced each other and jerrys heart
dropped like a safe pushed out of a sixtieth
story window alas was this the fair maiden
of his dreams something had happened to
helen spectacles horn-rimmed and enor-
mous were perched on her nose the ebony
black hair was combed severely back from her
high forehead and the ripe curves and con-
tours of the figure he had fondled in fancy
had become even riper helen must have tipped
the scales at at least a hundred and eighty

  ye gods terry exclaimed silently awe-
struck

  the big bouncing girl beamed on him

  its so nice to have you back sweetheart
she cooed ive thought about you so much
now we can set our wedding da like we
planned arent you simply thrilled 

  jerry sat down limply

  er-yes i suppose so er--how about a
drink  how about two three or for drinks 
that sea air you know ive a thirst like a
family of camels

  heien shook her head decidedly

  thats one thing youve got to correct

liquor is absolutely banned now that ive be-
come a charter member of the purity league
the-which jerry managed to gurgle
purity league a great change has come
over me since youve been away darling all
sexy exciting and stimulating things are ta-
boo ive come to realize the true meaning of
the flesh and the devil i hope in time to im-
press my teachings upon you after all dear-
est sin is ever present satan lurks everywhere
we must be continually on guard so good can
triumph over evil

   she sat down opposite carefully pulling her
skirt so it concealed a pair of legs that might
have held up a piano he noticed that her chins
had become so popular they had gone into a
second and third edition she beamed on him
while he tried to figure out what it was all
about

  i think id better go jerry murmured
i--i have an appointment with my doctor
i-i dont feel so well

  poor darling she went to the door with
him her arm linked with his you havent
even kissed me but never mind if youre not
feeling yourself we have years and years for
love making havent we

  jerry peered up at her

  but is that okay with your league
  helen laughed

  of course so long as were married tts
only on unmarried sin that the organization
frowns silly boy

   dazed jerry reeled into the street fell in
a taxi and was deposited in the kinsr midas
room of the city hotel he lapped up two
side cars so quickly he exceeded the speed
limit then for a chaser he had a couple of
shots of rye after that he went back to his old
studio in greenwich village threw himself
down on the couch and stared at the ceiling

  his dream girl had become a white elephant
his paris ir aginings were like ashes in his
mouth wh t could he do  a gentleman could
not very w eii break an engagement simply be-
cause the girl of his choice had doubled up
on her meals neither could he give her the
air v ith the excuse that the purity league


offended his aesthetic sense probably the or-
ganization did a jot of good in the world

  all that was artistic delicate and ethere-
al within jerry cried out he could no more
think of leading helen to the altar than he
could of battering down the empire state
building with a feather but what to do and
how to do it

  jerry groaned

  after awhile he got a drink-then another
-and another he began to feel better after
all he wasnt licked-yet there were always
ways and means alcohol sharpened his wits
and dulled his disappointment when he final-
ly slid out of his clothes and into bed he was
smiling there was a song on his lips a little
song of the paris ateliers to the effect that

     susi was a naughty girl
     really very shocking

     showed her lingerie and such

    filled a pretty stocking-

bated at great length all the evils of petting
and parked-car love making were dragged piti-
lessly out of the moonlight and into the glare
of fierce publicity jerry was really shocked
when he discovered what pernicious iniquitous
things rumble seats were

like it darling helen asked when the
meeting was finally over

  for the next week jerry was a model fian-
ce he called regularly on helen he took her
to a morning musicale he made social visits
with her and even attended one of the league
meetings

  he supposed hed be bored stiff but jerry
got quite a kick out of it the subject before
the committee was entitled should we
abandon rumble seats  the matter was de-

why dora he ex-
claimed i thought you
went home hours ago

i enjoyed every minute of it jerry said
truthfully er-how about stopping off
somewhere for a nice pineapple soda

a couple of days after that jerry called
her from the greenwich village studio

busy tonight sweetheart  he asked

nodarling


  i wonder he went on if youd like to
come down here and have supper with me at
the studio just we two ive learned some of
the parisian culinary secrets id like to see
what you think of my cooking

  oh that would be lovely helen cried
tonight what time

  ill be busy painting until six jerry said
thoughtfully better make it about seven-
thirty can i come and get you or do you
think youll be safe in a taxi with a strange
driver

  as he tidied up the studio jerry whistled
happily he had gone to great pains to make
his plans perfect they were elaborate and
entailed a great number of things that he fully
expected would forever end his engagement
now it was up to helen when the doorbell
tinkled he took off his chefs apron and let
his fiancee in

  at last ive been counting the minutes 
jerry cried

  helens nose lifted she sniffed the appetiz-
ing aromas drifting from the kitchenette

  yummy-yum-yum doesnt that smell di-
vine oh jerry i think its sweet of you to
have me down here its so cosy and intimate
and everything and i just love good things
to eat

  jerry looked at the spare tire she carried
around her waist

  ill bet you do he smiled make your-
self comfortable and ill serve the first course
directly by the way ive covered up all my
nudes so you wont be offended im doing a
picture called the modern three graces but
i dont think id better show it to you

  jerrys first course was latin quartier soup
it was rich brown and had a touch of garlic
to it helen waded into it with vim and vigor
spoon all dripping with onions she cried
softly how would you like to be my wrist-
watch 

  the next item on the menu was filet of sole
it was no ordinary fried flounder it was
crisp delicious fish with lemon-butter sauce
that was a masterpiece helen almost wept
tears of joy when she got a sample of it

  my this is grand jerry love did you go
to cooking or art school  i never tasted any-
thing so heavenly when were married you
can prepare all the meals

  but jerry wasnt listening the first part
of his plan was about ready to go into effect
he coughed and a minute later a strange thing
happened framed in the bedroom door a very

blonde very beautiful and very undressed
young lady appeared she rubbed her eyes
sleepily yawned and seemed utterly oblivious
to the fact she was partially unclothed

  helen saw her and dropped her fork
jerry jumped up

  why dora he exclaimed what in the
world are you doing here i thought youd
gone home hours ago

   dora smiled languorously

i was so tired i just stretched out on your
bed for forty winks and ive been there ever
since oh i didnt know you had company
this is my fiancee miss mathis helen
this is dora one of my best models

  he watched helen closely with an effort
she closed her mouth mumbled something un-
intelligible

umm im famished dora declared do
you mind if i pull up a chair and join you
not at all jerry said pushing a chair up
to the table sit down and fasten on the nose
bag plenty for all

   dora took her pink skin her cobwebby gar-
ments her willowy young body and curvy
figure to the table jerry went into the kitchen-
ette to get an extra plate and the meal con-
tinued

   with deft skill he served a roast of lamb
and what a roast it was with its touch of spicy
mint and delicate seasoning

  he coughed when he carved the chops from
it and another strange thing happened once
more in the doorway another blonde girl ap-
peared like dora she was attired in nothing
but a smile and some lace she carried a large
towel with which she vigorously rubbed her
golden hair

  why flora jerry cried havent you
gone home yet

the second blonde widened her blue eyes
i-i took the liberty of using your bath-
tub making ducky-wucky then i caught the
smell of cooking and it drove me out here
swell idea jerry said generously plenty
for all here sit down and fall to

   he got a new set of table tools and a plate
flora joined those at the banquet board jerry
stole a surreptitious glance at helen he ex-
pected dismay indignation instead there was
only a smile of vast contentment on her round
face with a sinking heart jerry saw his elab-
orate scheme wasnt half as good in effect as it
had been in theory

  the plump and prudish helen was more in-


terested in what he had cooked than the two
beautiful young ladies

  with a low feeling jerry went to fetch
the salad bowl that was positively his chef
doeuvre one of the greatest of the master
chefs in paris had imparted the secret of the

  why laura what are you doing here
jerry asked but faintly this time with no vim
and vigor

  lauras vivid lips parted in a shadowy smile

  i got interested in a book and forgot to
dress a fewrtninutes ago i heard sounds of
dinner going on and thought id better look
in can you give a poor girl a bone

jerry made the introduction and waved her
into a chair with an effort helen moved her
gaze from the salad bowl long enough to mur-
mur 

  plezedtomeetcha 

out in the kitchenette jerry kicked himself
what a chump he had been certain that un-
veiled charms dazzling skin swelling breasts
and gorgeous hips would be sufficient to make
helen hurl the diamond engagement ring in

  tell me all about
paris jerry she said
how do they make
love there

dressing it was piquant and tantalizing won-
derful beyond words helen sighed luxuri-
ously when she tasted it

  for the third time jerry coughed and for
the third time a somewhat unclad blonde and
beautiful young lady came into the studio

his face and stamp stridently from the studio
helen with the contrariness of her sex was
talking in friendly fashion with the three fair
models he could hear her telling them what a
swell meal it had been how much she had en-
joyed it and how she was going to let him do


all the cooking when the nuptial ding-dongs
were through echoing

  nut jerry hissed dope thats what
i am

  he grabbed a bottle of scotch took a swig
and didnt even bother to pop a clove into his
mouth he got out the freezer with the boule
miche mousse which had taken him an hour
to prepare dumped it into sherbet glasses and
distributed it

  when everything was all over terry said

  all right scram girls youve fed your
faces so lam

 he did the dishes while flora dora and
 laura got dressed and departed helen sat in

  listen gals
he said finally
this studio is too
small for four

ly gotten her mind off the teachings of the
league

 he put the last dish away washed his hands
 turned out the kitchenette light and hung up
 his apron

the big studio chair gazing serenely into space
as she thought about the dinner she had con-
sumed in the kitchenette jerry wrestled with
the pots and pans cursing his hard luck and
overstimulated imagination he doubted that
helen would have been interested if he had
framed up some amorous love scene between
himself and the models his big mistake was
giving her anything to eat that had complete-

 jerry love

coming

 i want you to know how much i appreciate
 your invitation helen said it was so sweet
 of you

 thats okay jerry mumbled im sorry
 about those girls-


   oh thats all right i didnt mind them in
the least they seemed awfully nice besides
going around without clothes is their business
ill bet that at heart theyre just pure and
good

   ill bet he nodded dismally

   helen transferred her bulk to the studio
divan she stretched out comfortably turning
on her side her dress caught under her and
crept up to her knee but she didnt seem to
mind it she held out a plump hand

   come over and sit with me ive hardly
had a chance to see you since you returned
sweetheart just think a whole year

   jerry approached the divan gingerly he sat
down on what little space was left helen took
off her spectacles and laid them on the table
she smiled at him coyly before she caught his
fingers in hers and drew him toward her

  sweet boy do you realize you havent
made love to me in months i feel so con-
tented so perfectly happy for the last ten
minutes a curious emotion has come over me
i simply dont know what it is it makes me
want you close so close jerry here put
your head on my shoulder and tell me how
much you love me

   with a sigh and death in his heart jerry
followed her instructions her bosom was like
a soft feather pillow large and comfortable
he brushed away a souvenir of the salad and
relaxed a little

   this all right he croaked

   she stroked his rough tumbled hair

   jerry tell me about paris is it as wicked
as they say how do they make love there
teach me-

   as she spoke she took his hand she moved
over on the divan her skirt went further up
so that jerry saw an expanse of white skin
above the stocking top he began to feel faint
worried and troubled from the looks of things
helen had completely forgotten the oath of
allegiance she had given the league

   how about a picture show  he suggested

   tier breathing was quick uneven she ca-
 ressed him as she urged herself still closer

  put your arms around me darling re-
member were going to be married eoon you
must demonstrate how youre going to make
love to me when were married

   jerry went cold all over there was no mis-
taking her intentions he tried to gently but
firmly get out of her embrace it was like try-
ing to break out of sing sing with a tooth-
pick she smothered him in her arms draw-

ing him to her closer and closer her lips were
wide now and her eyes dreamy and half shut
he could feel the heat of her ample body and
abruptly like a bolt of lightning jerry found
the answer to his problem

 he sat up broke her tight grip and stumbled
 away from the divan

 so this is what you are he cried oh
 how thankful i am ive found you out in time
 helen do you realize what-

 something in his strident tone dampened
 her ardor she blinked straightened pulled
 her skirt down and put on her spectacles

 jerry im sorry i didnt realize i-

 not a word i realize everything

she stretched out imploring arms

 forgive me jerry i dont know what came
 over me i never felt that way before jerry
 you must-

 he shook his head firmly

not a chance our engagement is over
youve showed me exactly what you have in
your mind and heart oh helen to think you
are like this you- the girl i dreamed of in
paris-the girl i could hardly wait to see once
more

 she wiped her nose got up unsteadily and
 took off the engagement ring she handed it
 to him unsteadily

 youre right i must pay the penalty i
 dont deserve your love

 jerry put the ring in his pocket

 but we can still be friends he said mag-
 nanimously

 she grasped at the idea eagerly

 of course and maybe youll have me for
 dinner again

 resolutely jerry suppressed his happy smile

 im afraid not to be candid id never
 trust myself alone with you again 

 he telephoned for a taxi said good-bye to
 helen forever and mixed himself a drink in
 the kitchenette he carried it into the studio
 put out all the lights except one and relaxed
 in the big chair

 after a minute he heard a cough he looked
 up and there was dora in the bedroom door-
 way just as she had been at dinner

why dora what are you doing here
he demanded

 she pattered across the studio and perched
 herself on the arm of his chair

 i didnt have any place to go so i came
 back got in through the rear door listen

dan morgan scanned the help
wanted column of the morning news-
paper hed been doing just that every
day since the dean of strathmore university
had handed him a sheepskin diploma shook
his hand sent him out into a world that was
waiting to be conquered

  your college education will be your card
of admittance to success the dean had said
in his graduating address

  for that reason dan always started his
scanning of the help wanted columns by
looking under the c list today for the first
time he spotted an ad that started college
graduate wanted he read on

    college graduate wanted young firm-
  willed young man with some knowledge
  of psychology one who can drive car
  compensation commensurate with ability

gorgeous
little bra t

by joyce carroll

the water fell in
an icy cascade over
her body


  for reply please call wedgemere 

  after seven-thirty pm

  dan clipped the ad he had no intentions
of waiting until seven-thirty evidently the
employer wanted all calls to come to his home
down in a drug store phone booth dan went
to work he discovered that wedgemere 
was the private phone number of wellington
cornwall dewey the financier he discovered
also that mr deweys offices were in the
statler building

   a straight-haired thoroughly efficient sec-
retary came out to see dan at mr deweys
suite of offices she was sorry but if he had
no appointment mr dewey could not see him

  its a matter of life and death dan pro-
tested i must see him

  wellington cornwall dewey had white hair
and a perpetual sour face he looked up as
dan entered his sedate walnut-panelled sanc-
tum sanctorum

  i read your ad in this mornings paper
dan blurted

  the financier almost choked and is
that what you call a matter of life and death

   sure my life and death if i dont get the
job ill starve

  the thoroughly efficient secretary almost
fainted the reason for it was the smile on
mr deweys face-an admiring smile

  youre hired he announced without
any further questioning that is providing
youll take the job

  ill take any job dan said dean acker-
son of strathmore university said the world
was waiting to be conquered

  sit down mr dewey invited dan sat
the financier leaned forward im going to
europe he said ill be away for two
months i have a young daughter-a brat she
doesnt want to go to europe she doesnt want
to do anything normal people want to do now
shes in love with the chauffeur im firing
him tomorrow she may be in love with the
butcher boy your job will be to act as chauf-
feur and yet keep a weather-eye on ruth i
dont want her to suspect that youre a guardi-
an ill pay you fifty dollars a week for the two
months im gone and give you a bonus that
will amaze you if you succeed in doing some-
thing with the brat do you want the job

  yes dan said

  a lean-faced butler answered the door
at the palatial dewey town house dan stared
at him the butlers right eye was black and
swollen

  im the new chauffeur dan said

  the butler nodded yes mr dewey called
step right in

  dan stepped in he had seen some swell in-
terior layouts but this topped them all wine
colored plush hangings and inch-thick oriental
rugs it was sumptuous with a capital itali-
cized s

  run into a door dan questioned pleas-
antly indicating the black eye

  the butler scowled no miss ruth pre-
sented me with this little memento

  dan whistled this dewey offspring must
be a hellion is-is she home he queried
a trifle apprehensively

  most assuredly if youll step into the
drawing room ill tell her youre here he
dropped his voice to a confidential whisper i
should advise you to be very subservient

  the drawing room was the size of a barn
its walls hung with expensive tapestries a bal-
cony surrounded it off of which were duplex
bedrooms dan was admiring a full-length
gainsborough when he heard a feminine voice
he looked up a girl in peach panties and a
flimsy brassiere was standing against the bal-
cony railing her flame-colored hair fell al-
most to her shoulders in a long bob she posed
arrogantly hands on hips shoulders squared

  dans eyes widened surely this couldnt
be ruth-the brat he had anticipated a pig-
tailed child of thirteen or fourteen the girl
on the balcony was twenty if she was a day
mature as any woman her rounded bosom
made mock of the brassiere cups as a covering
or shield her hips were smoothly curved un-
der the panties her full sensuous mouth had
its share of carmine lipstick and her eyes were
carefully made up

  she leaned over the railing dan could see
the white tops of her bosom and the cleft di-
viding it so youre the new chauffeur she
said

  dan remembered the butlers warning er
-yes miss dewey he murmured

  her eyes flashed dont miss dewey me
whats your name

  d-dan m-morgan

  she walked along the balcony came down
the plush-carpeted steps it was amazing how
unashamed she was of the brevity of her cos-
tume her bosom swayed under the brassiere


and her hips seemed to swing rhythmically
dans eyes raced up and down her figure she
was gorgeously proportioned nice firm white
thighs and a plane-flat torso

   she reached the bottom step paused do i
pass muster or would you like me to remove
the brassiere and panties for a complete in-
spection she snapped sarcastically

  dan colored i-im sorry he mumbled

  you should be now it was her turn to
examine she did carefully there were long
moments of silence youre not bad she
said where did father find you 

  i-i found your father

  he told you im boss around here while
hes away didnt he 

  er-yes

   be sure you understand that wilkins will
show you to your room on the third floor the
cars are in the garage you might look them
over she turned started up the steps again

   dan watched her departure particularly the
gelatinous movement of her sensuously fash-
ioned hips he was thinking how much she
needed a few good whacks in punishment for
her outrageous conduct thinking that maybe
he would be the one to administer the punish-
ment

  wilkins the butler not only showed dan
to his room but attempted to show him the
light

   shes a wildcat if there ever was one he
said i dont know how long im going to
stand it with the master away you know what
she needs 

  dan knew he said so in no uncertain
terms wilkins agreed

  mr wellington cornwall dewey left
for europe on monday night at eleven no
sooner had the liner nosed out into the river
than ruth returned to the limousine and be-
gan giving orders

   drive to the kit-kat club she said

  dan hesitated mr dewey had given him
voluminous instructions prior to sailing it
-its rather late miss ruth he said

  do as i say she screamed and wait
for me

  dan did as she said and dan waited at
four in the morning two men-about-town car-
ried miss ruth dewey out of the kit-kat
club and attempted to get in the car with her

we spotted this dame climbin out

  a window one cop said
her dress was hanging on by barely a thread
even her brassiere was slightly askew enough
to bare a goodly expanse of curved white flesh

  dan knew he had a job on his hands he
slid out from behind the wheel ejected one
man-about-town by the scruff of the neck the
other by the seat of the pants and proceeded
to the dewey residence

  both wilkins and ruths maid were deep
in the arms of morpheus it resolved upon
dan to see that his charge got to bed he car-
ried her up to her room proceeded to prepare
her for retirement fortunately for him the
men-about-town had done most of the undress-
ing in the kit-kat-club

  his fingers trembled when he reached dan-
gerous territory it was a new experience for
him and one not without its emotional effects
he was only human and observing beauty
such as she boasted could not be impersonal
for all his self-control

  finally he managed to get her under the
covers the temptation to sample her moist
red lips was too great he leaned over slip-
ped his hand over one warm silken shoulder
kissed her mouth

  it was fully an hour before he stopped ting-
ling

  dan found out soon enough what it was
to be run ragged night clubs teas bridge par-
ties greenwich village parties rare was the
morning when he got in before three

  it had to come to an end sometime a party
in westchester ended in a riot the police were
called ruth and a dozen of her young cohorts
were arrested the story got into the papers
a week later there was a cable from welling-
ton cornwall dewey to dan

    stop that brat stop
              w c dewey

  dan didnt mention the cable to ruth but
that very evening when she called for the
car he marched into her bedroom without
knocking she was standing before the dress-
ing table applying lipstick to her mouth she
caught his reflection in the glass wheeled

  what do you mean by entering my room
this way she demanded

  dan tilted his cap back how did you want
me to come in on roller skates 

  her cheeks pinked and her body tensed
you-you-you- words failed her

  dan shut the door youre not going out
tonight he said

  the second shock almost prostrated the girl
what do you mean she gasped

  at any moment dan expected her to fly
at him and treat him to the same type of shiner
she had given wilkins the butler but he had
gone this far and there was no retreating

  just what i said baby youre staying in
tonight

  she lunged at him dan side-stepped caught
her arm whirled her down on the sofa she
hit it hard bounced up hit it again bounced
again by the time she stopped she was wild
with indignation she sat erect glared at him
the unexpected exercise took her breath away
she was panting her round bosom rising and
falling rapidly

  youre fired she screamed get out

  dan grinned you cant fire me sister just
calm down and behave like a human being
youre spending this night at home its about
time you read a book

  she leaped up came at him again dan
snaked an arm about her waist pinned her
close against him he caught both her wrists
in his hand held them behind her back she
struggled valiantly but to no avail dan tossed
her back on the sofa began ripping off her
dress

  anyone entering the room at that precise
moment would have imagined the worst with
ruthless disregard for her expensive satin
dress dan tore it off her body

  he stepped back surveyed his handiwork
if ruth dewey had been stunning in clothes
she was a knockout this way her body was
an harmonious symphony of curves from
coned bosom to dimpled knees dan retreated
to the door he knew it would be dangerous
to remain dangerous for more than one rea-
son he jerked the key out of the lock opened
the door

  good night he grinned

  she bounded up again dont you dare
lock me in

  but dan had already closed the door turned
the key from the outside slipped it into his
pocket he sighed as he walked up to his room
thinking how easy it would have been to let
himself go with wellington cornwall deweys
daughter she was certainly a gorgeous little
brat it took a long time for dan to forget her
pink and white curves

  he was just about dozing off when he heard
the shrill blast of a police whistle a hoarse


shout a high-pitched squeal he jumped out
of bed slid his trousers on someone was
pounding on the front door in the hall dan
met wilkins

  what-what is it the frightened butler
blurted

  dan stepped to the door threw it open two
policemen were standing there each holding
one of ruth deweys arms as she struggled to
release herself

  dan gaped in amazement she was dressed
in panties and a brassiere and white sports
shoes

  we were coming by in the squad car and
spotted this dame climbin out a window one
of the copssaid she claims she belongs here

  she does dan admitted thanks a lot
officers you see shes not feeling well and-

  one of the cops grinned sure we un-
derstand they shoved ruth into the foyer
dan lifted her in his arms carried her up the
steps to her room en route she pummeled his
head and shoulders shrieked madly in the
room dan dumped her on the bed

  ruth dewey was still uncowed dont you
dare lay a hand on me she shrieked dont
you dare touch me ill have you arrested
touch you dan smiled no you brat
i wouldnt soil my hands with you i have an-
other little trick up my sleeve he stepped
out of the room closed the door wilkins was
on the landing shaking like a leaf in his long
nightgown

  oh this is terrible he moaned what
will mr dewey say

  hell probably give us both medals of
honor now listen wilkins fill up every
available pot in the house with ice cold water
bring them up here if you hear any violent
screaming dont pay any attention in case
the police come tell them miss dewey is ill
and having a fit now make it snappy with
that water

  dazed but obedient the butler hurried off
he returned in a few minutes carrying two
aluminum pots of cold water dan took them

  okay keep them coming ill toss the emp-
ties out into the hall fill them as fast as you
can

  brimming pots in hand dan stepped into
ruth deweys bedroom she was sitting on the
edge of the bed defiantly dan walked for-
ward

  what are you going to do she gasped
this the contents of one pot poured
over her she screamed spluttered gasped
surish the contents of the second pot hit
her full in the face fell in an icy cascade over
her body wilkins was at the door with two
more containers dan took them gave him the
empties the third potfull of water soaked
ruth made tissue paper of her brassiere and
panties she looked like a drowned rat when
the fourth poured over her

  dan got some of the splashings the water
was certainly cold he grinned as he watched
her shivering in a pool of it trying to wipe
her damp hair back from her face

  at the tenth pot of water ruth broke down
began to cry she buried her head in the sop-
ping wet pillow sobbed convulsively dan de-
cided she had had enough

  wilkins will bring you clean sheets and
blankets he said turn the mattress over
good night

  he couldnt go to sleep for a long time he
paced the third floor hallway smoking some-
thing peculiar disturbed him no matter how
much he tried to sweep it from his mind he
found it impossible to discard the attractive
picture of ruth in her wet panties and bras-

siere the firm roundness of her bosom and
the rest of her curvy body kept looming up
before him

  he tip-toed downstairs stood for a mo-
ment at her door she was still sobbing fitfully
dan opened the door softly entered the room
ruth hadnt moved the bed was still soaking
wet dan snapped on the light

  you little fool i told you to change those
sheets do you want to get pneumonia 
y-yes

  very smart arent you dan stepped to
the bed lifted her in his arms carried her to
a couch in ten minutes he had the mattress
turned and the new sheets and blankets on
all right get into bed take off that brassiere
and those panties

  she sat up eyes blazing no

  i said take them off

  i wont

  then i will

  before he reached her dan saw something
happen to her eyes they softened and the
pupils dilated her red lips parted and her bo-
som rose and fell rapidly he understood-and
stopped short

  well what are you waiting for she
panted

  dan was struck dumb he stared at her
watching her breathing fast suddenly ruth
leaped into his arms

  are you blind she cried cant you see
anything i know who you are i sneaked up
to your room and saw your diploma and the
instructions dad gave you ive just been do-
ing all this to egg you on

 wellington cornwall dewey came
down the gangplank ruth flew into his arms
kissed his cheeks full of lipstick when he re-
covered some measure of composure he said
to dan

  well young man

  dan blushed i-im afraid ive been un-
true to my trust mr dewey we didnt cable
you for fear the shock would be too much i
-i married your gorgeous brat yesterday
wellington cornwall dewey beamed i
promised you a bonus if you succeeded in do-
ing something with her youve done the best
possible thing-taken her off my hands youll
get the bonus and a job in my office you can
have anything you wish he sighed ah
what a splendid homecoming

  off to one side ruth glared at dan with

 pealed to me as a great and worthy undertaking
 whether the anthropologist describes the bes-
 tialities and savageries of african tribes or the
 supersensitive sensualities of the most aesthetic
 races he should use the frankest and simplest
 language i saw early that interesting scientific

big boy how about a relative of that glass
youre holding

  there was another cough and flora
came through the dimly lighted room her
white skin gleaming like marble

  i had to come back she announced i
was so lonesome

  fine ill make you both a drink in a
minute jerry told them

  and dont forget me make it three
laura said joining the group im so thirsty
i could drink a reservoir through a straw
so jerry made drinks all around and looked
at the blondes one was as perfect as the
other he frowned thoughtfully

  listen gals he announced finally this
studio is too small for four but all right for
two see im going to tear three strips of
paper into various lengths the one who draws
the shortest-

  after a minute dora laughed excitedly she
displayed the shortest strip of paper and
smiled joyfully

  goodnight girls she cried linking her
arms around jerrys willing neck be seeing
you-in the morning

continued from page 

you will pay the price by losing a dear friend
look he began reasonably in my lan-
guage you would be called nuts how can
staying with you lose me a friend you have
your problems theyre none of my business
   and i have my desires-which are your
business come what may-i stay here

  the gray eyes lost their moody film of sor-
row as they shook hands on the bargain yes
come what may the girl promised    and
carter bent over to meet her demanding lips

  her body was burning he could feel the
warmth of her through the robe his fingers
fumbled clumsily with the jeweled clasp at her
neck but not even his clumsiness could detract


from the thrilling demands of those luscious
lips

  the gown parted slightly and carter caught
his breath lest the beauty which met his eyes
disappear at any moment her flesh was
creamy like the softness of an inner mag-
nolia petal and the swift rise of the bosom
formed twin peaks of the most delicate pink
the soft violet shadow between was as fra-
grant as it was warm

  carter ached with the desire of the moment
his hands trembling and warm searched over
that vibrant whiteness as though they would
grasp their full beauty his lips trembling like
those of a school boys met her demands with
counter supplications

  it was terrifying-it was supreme it was all
the life and death and glory and passion of
the accumulated ages   

  some sixth sense warned him he glanced
over to where dael was her gleaming hair
spread fan-wise over the coral tapestry one
arm as white as milk had fallen until the hand
hung like a crumpled blossom the fingers just
clearing the soft taupe of the carpet

  beneath the amber glow of the lamps she
was a picture in gold and marble he could
see the line of the thigh long and curving as
it was outlined sharply against the color of her
gaping robe

  but some noise had awakened him a foot-
step pausing by the door-a light hand turn-
ing the handle gently    carter sprung to
his feet scarcely knowing what the slowly
opening door would reveal

  and then a bombshell went off inside his
head he glanced at the clock three-forty
could daels husband have arrived  could this
be the boy friend certainly it was no mere
servant

  carter it was julien it was julien
whose ashen face and unbelieving eyes were
staring at him madly it was julien whose
body seemed to crumple before his startled
gaze and in that moment carter saw the
spirit the hope the life itself die in his friend
-leaving only the dull material body whose
functions went on as usual but whose main-
spring was forever destroyed

  he whirled around to blast dael for her
perfidy but what he saw in those tortured eyes
made the words freeze on his lips the loss
of a friend she had said but it was really
a double loss for he saw on her grief-stricken
face the complete loss of a beloved lover that
he had been merely a foil to effect this tragic

break he realized now very clearly the moti-
vation was still hazy  but the bleak majestic
ethics which made this woman give up the
only man she had ever loved-given him up
in the only way she could-freed him com-
pletely by destroying his trust in one who was
still trustworthy-that was the thing which
made carters heart bleed

  he walked from the room slowly like a
man who has seen too much and compre-
hended too little he heard the door close after
him he heard the key turn in the lock

  sleep was not for him that evening he took
up his stand beneath her balcony hidden
there in the heavy foliage he tried to fathom
the events of the evening

  soon two figures appeared on the balcony
two figures who drifted together and be-
came one-even as the moon slipped behind a
cloud as though even luna would not intrude
upon that final sorrowful farewell the sound
of a low sob reached carters ears which one
it came from he could never tell but the sound
was like the sob of a sorrowing animal whose
hurt has gone too deep for healing

  he never saw julien again he heard that
he and madame julien had taken a small cot-
tage far away from paris and that monsieur
had developed a peculiar phobia against al-
pine country-especially the tyrol region

  but he did see dael he caught sight of
her in the bois one afternoon during the win-
ter she was in a motor and with her was the
ugliest grossest man he had ever seen the
bulbous nose was red and the hand on the
wheel was cruel and grasping

  what a beautiful woman he remarked
casually to a fellow diner certainly that can-
not be her husband

  indeed it is-and it is quite a story mon-
sieur the fellow almost licked his chops
with the morsel of gossip madame it is
said had a secret love affair and monsieur
feigned an illness in order to arouse all her
gratitude she gave up the lover thinking that
her husband required all her attention and
affection-is it not a droll story monsieur is
as well as he ever was-but madame-ah she
has paid heavily for that little escapade it is
also rumored that monsieur threatened to kill
the lover but everyone says madame got rid
of him just in time a strange couple eest
vrai

  and as carter watched the motor pass he
saw one of those great paws rest heavily on
her silk-encased shoulder the fingers curled


in cutting into the flesh but the woman did
not draw away she smiled and patted his
hand-like one who scarcely feels anything
and so can afford to be generous knowing
that the motivating dream of a life time is
protected forever against the grossness of
reality

nightly at eleven

continued from page 

in his fingers he had some difficulty getting it
into the lock at last he opened the door and
stepped into the velvety darkness at the same
moment a clock chimed softly the hour of
eleven in the shadows

  carter went cautiously forward a couple
of chairs sprang out and snapped at his ankles
but he hardly felt them he struck a match for
a guide found the hall that led to the bedroom
and pressed on naturally as she expected him
she wouldnt be putting on the charm parade
before the mirror shed probably be in bed
curled up like a kitten snug and comfy car-
ter banged his nose on the bedroom door got
it open and lit another match it flickered long
enough for him to locate the light switch he
switched it on took a look at the bed and felt
his burning emotions drop from fever heat
to zero

  the bed like the room was deserted
carter peered around with unbelieving eyes
at length he discovered something pinned to
the pillow this something was a note ad-
dressed to him with shaking fingers he un-
pinned it and took it to the lamp beside the
bed he swallowed moistened his dry lips and
opened the note

  in another minute he was reading

  dear jack

     im so sorry but it was all a frame-up
  you see im to be a member of the
  omega epsilon sorority and the nightly
  show at eleven was part of the initiation

  i wasnt kidding when i told you my
  real name is cicily claythorne please
  forgive the deception and thanks for pay-
  ing the rent they didnt think a hard
  boiled broadzuay guy like you would ever
  tumble

    farewell and thanks for everything

  the letter was signed with her scrawled
initials for a long time carter stared at them
he began to smile

  just a well directed kick in the trousers
he said out loud i had it coining to me and
i-

  he broke off abruptly as he spoke he had
turned the sheet of notepaper over in his hand
suddenly more writing caught his eye he held
the missive closer to the lamp while the ther-
mometer of his emotions climbed out of the
sub-zero temperature and went up to the boil-
ing point again

  it took him a minute to decipher the few
words she had added

  they said

butterfield - call me up when

  you get over your disappointment

star chaser

continued from page 

maid you go to the telephone and call this
number it isnt in the directory it is mr
winslows private number his man will get
hold of him wherever he is tell him you know
a girl who sings that song around the house
and her name is wendy and she is dancing
at the misty roof tonight dont say any
more

  the dragon obeyed without question he
shouted at me she reported but i hung up
on him now what youd better rest you
only have five minutes before you have to
dress to dance down the glass staircase

  but wendy wasnt going to rest she
couldnt all she could think of was jeff shy
elusive jeff broadcasting his appeal to her to
let him know where she was tomorrow the
hounds of the press would be snapping at his
heels

  jeff was coming into the nightclub with his
bodyguard as wendy appeared at the top of
the glass staircase down which she was to tap
dance on her toes he wasnt looking at her
he was looking around the nightclub he had
seen clarence sitting alone and glowering at
the featured dancer and at last he had fol-
lowed clarences glare at wendy half way
down the stairs on her toes

  the wendy in gingham house pajamas or
slacks her brown hair tied back with a girlish
ribbon was not at all like this glamorous crea-
ture in silver mist poised on silver toes   
not like except as he glanced away her hands
slim expressive hands so he looked again
and wendy was almost down now and smiling
at him

  the nightclub became a chaos of sound as


 she finished the difficult dance not three feet
 from where jeff sat hello jeff she said
 softly then began her difficult way back up
 the glass stairs and out of sight

   at the door of her dressing room when her
 dance was over she found jeff confronted by
 her dragon maid

    its all right sarah hes a friend wendy
 said quietly

   jeff shook his head no im not i
 came to ask why you didnt laugh at me while
 i hid at your house you must have laughed
 at my daring to think you may dawn were
 chasing me you whom men chase why
 they wanted me to sing in a picture opposite
 may dawn you werent after my autograph
 that day you were running away from people
 too werent you

   yes i was but afterwards i treasured
 your autograph wendy said quietly

   you parked in the alley for the same
 reason i did not to force me to speak to you

 why did you wait on me and let me growl
 at you knowing all the time you were far more
 famous than i a mere radio singer espe-
 cially after viola told you i wasnt hurt at
 all merely hiding

   oh yes viola    how is she wendy
 asked coolly

   she doesnt count never did your father
 sent for her i didnt he wanted you to be
 safe for clarence anyway viola wouldnt
 have me now i gave up everything to find
 you radio movies    just a dub chasing
 a star  

   jeff stop being so silly im not a star
 and if i had been i would have wanted you
 to chase me wendy said softly i thought
 you didnt even like me you said i was
 homely and scolded me   

   never mind all that all this time i actu-
 ally thought i could take you away from that
 fat banker i thought i had youth and posi-
 tion and something girls seem to want in-
 stead i find you have everything that you took
 clarence because you wanted him not through
 lack of money its your turn to laugh jeff
 turned on his heel and was gone so swiftly
 wendy had no chance to stop him or even run
 after him a chorus of strip dancers got be-
 tween but jeff had vanished

   well tie that wendy said softly as she
 went back to her dressing room and he
 actually believes ill let him get away she
 began undressing not waiting for sarah

 you clear up here im taking a taxi to his

rooms i found where they were the other
day

  but mr dilford protested sarah he
might get smart   

  hes given up wendy said carelessly
and crammed her beret down on her head and
ran out and down the stairs to the stage door
she flung herself into a taxi which came up
promptly and gave jeffs number not until
the door slammed and the taxi drove away did
she realize she wasnt alone clarence dilford
sat in the shadowy corner

  sarah stared after the taxi and her lips
thinned as the street light showed dilfords
head against the rear glass as the taxi spun
down the side street she ran to the next taxi
follow that one and dont lose sight she
snapped

  wendy wasnt frightened when she saw
clarence sitting there already she was at
jeffs room arguing with him showing him
he was being a fool once more in giving up
so tamely

  sorry didnt know this taxi was occu-
pied drop me at the corner and ill get anoth-
er she said carelessly

  i heard the address you gave nothing
doing hes a down and out singer without
a job clarence said blandly this isnt a
taxi except externally ive hired it every
night for just this chance were on the way
to my cabin on the river tomorrow youll
be begging me to make you mrs dilford but
maybe by then i will be over my desire to make
you mine because i will have gained that
end

  why you fat fool you cant get away
with this snapped wendy let me out of
here before i scream the police here

  clarence flung his arm about her and clamp-
ed his hand over her mouth scream ahead
my dear he crooned and pulled her onto his
knees he jerked the shades down with his
free hand then snapped on the light and laugh-
ed unpleasantly

  seven solid months ive waited and youve
held me off he gave her suit coat a jerk
that pulled it off then clawed at her satin
blouse pretty swell he gloated his little
pig eyes roving over wendy as he held her
head jammed against his shoulder

  she bit his fingers viciously and he pinched
her soft arm till she felt her head spinning
clarence dilford had given up his dumb wor-
ship of wendy and wendy knew it too late

  so you were going to see the singer eh


well he wont want you when i get through
with you my lady no man wants second
hand goods

  then you dont want me wendy said sul-
lenly rubbing her aching arm

  whats that

  you heard id be second hand goods to
you after jeff winslow so laugh that off
wendy was reckless now clarence had gone
berserk and she was lost anyway but hed pay
dearly for his actions

  i dont believe it youre too smart your-
self clarence said scornfully

  but once i wasnt the night you forced
me to agree to marry you the next week
nothing mattered then nothing you hear
i loved jeff and i wanted to be made love to
by the man i loved

  why you    you    little hussy roared
clarence shaking her viciously her bobbing
bosom caught his eye and his anger left him
it doesnt matter even if you arent lying
he said thickly what the hell    as the
taxi swayed violently then crashed into some
obstruction

  wendy was flung from his arms to the
floor as the taxi tilted then went over on one
side

  clarences chauffeur was swearing as he
pried open the door hurt sir  a taxi driver
side swiped us he    his voice died in
a gulp as he was flung to one side wendy was
lifted up and out the door which had become
the roof over her head the other taxi was
right side up though one fender was slightly
damaged sarah stood beside it and jeff had
wendy in his arms he carried her to the taxi
and put her inside

  sarah got up beside the driver and the taxi
was off followed by clarences screamed
threats and the shouts of the chauffeur

  i saw that fat thug make off with you
sarahs voice floated back and grabbed a
taxi and this gentleman was sitting in it we
followed you and took a chance on side swip-
ing you

  ill take up from there sarah jeff said
and pulled down the curtain shutting the front
seat off he wrapped his topcoat around
wendy who was shivering with excitement
as much as the cold i was waiting there to
see you come out and join clarence when
your maid flung herself in with me and told
me shed been hired to protect you from your
banker friend by then i knew id been forty
kinds of a fool to give you up seeing you

rush out and get into dilfords taxi told me
that i was blind with jealousy

  wendy waited breathlessly she was no
longer cold maybe it was because the way
jeff was holding her brought his hand against
her bare flesh

  i havent even a job but ill get one if
youll marry me   he said when she didnt
speak

  oh jobs arent importaat they want
me in hollywood to dance in-a picture and
said if id come icould have my say about a
leading man    and i wouldnt leave here
because you were still here arent we a pair
of fools

  blissful ones jeffs hand slid down her
spine searching out the dimples while his
mouth came down on her mouth and lingered

  wendy began to get breathless and liked
it liked everything jeff was doing

  where to buddy came the drivers voice

  turn down this side road    theres a
lane i never went there myself but my other
lady used to tell me about it then park and
relax said sarahs voice

  aw i dont feel like relaxing say you
got a nice smile when you use it how about
us cuddling a little if theyve got things on
their minds asked the taxi driver

  we might its likely to be dull sitting
here two or three hours said sarahs slightly
breathless voice say who said you could
get so personal    well if your hands
are cold    fresh

  why babe you wear a girdle tsk tsk

  wendy smiled as the taxi drivers voice
faded she felt jeffs lips curl into laughter
just before they burned a path down her
throat

  the taxi rocked to a stop because the driver
needed both hands to convince sarah of cer-
tain things wendy didnt know it had stop-
ped she didnt know anything except that
well remembered thrills were following jeffs
hands over her body

  the meter ticked on in the city reporters
searched in vain for one jeffrey winslow who
had broadcast an appeal to an unknown girl
it was the best human interest story hed ever
given them better than the fat contract wait-
ing for him when he should return to his
rooms to meet the impatient movie magnate
who was wearing out his carpets they envied
the little unknown waif jeff was searching
for a little star chaser probably who had been
brainy enough to run away
