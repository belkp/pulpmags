praises
cystex
 dr w r george
  doctors and druggists everywhere approve of the
prescription cystex because of its splendid ingredients
and quick action for instanco dr w r george
graduate medical dept university of indiana former
health commissioner of indianapolis and medical di-
rector for insurance company  years recently wroto
the following letter
  there is little question but what properly func-
tioning kidney and bladder organs are vital to the
health insufficient kidney excretions are the cause of
much needless suffering with aching back weakness
painful joints and rheumatic pains headaches and a
general run-down exhausted body this condition also
interferes with normal rest at night by causing the
sufferer to rise frequently for relief and results in
painful excretion itching smarting end burning i am
of the opinion that cystex definitely corrects frequent
causes poor kidney functions of such conditions and
i have actually prescribed in my own practice for
many years past the same ingredients contained in
your formula cystex not only exerts a splendid in-
fluence in flushing poisons from the urinary tract but
also has an antiseptic action and assists in freeing the
blood of retained toxins believing as i do that so
meritorious a product deserves the endorsement of the
medical profession i am happy indeed to lend my

thrill chaser
                by mary ann de forest
linda carrolls gray eyes
j fairly smoked as she faced her
sister across the breakfast
table
  i tell you i wont she was de-
claring rebelliously i wont give
up my own perfectly thrilling plans
for this summer just to trail down
to long island with you and your
adoring husband bob is a peach
but-
  of course he is helene kershaw
broke in sharply or he wouldnt
have put up with all of your wild
escapades getting caught in that
speakeasy raid doing stunt stuff
for the movies and now it is prac-
tically on your account that he
finally agreed to take that kvale
place for the season think of it
and southampton is-
  a pain in the neck if youd ask
me linda flipped over a cup of
black coffee although i will ad-
mit the kvale place is pretty hot
even if the house party they threw
wasnt and their son ted whom
you insisted on my going there to
meet was even less so
  but darling it wasnt ted
  i know it was courtney the
older boy i remember linda
thrill chaser

broke in promptly and to forestall
a lengthy repetition of facts the
only one of the kvales who could
take it when the family fortune
went pff-t well thats grand but
since i didnt meet the hero and
since he later shoved off to parts
unknown and there isnt a man in
our crowd who could even leave a
finger print on my heart why go to
all the bother of southampton and
a house party it would only mean
doing the same
stupid things en-
tertaining the same
stupid people
  but it wouldnt
helene said swiftly
because ive in-
vited-
   the most in-
teresting young
man lindas im-
itation of past de-
scriptions was per-
fect  so different
and absolutely
thrilling
  well he is
  linda whooped
then that settles
it count me out
because i positively
draw the line at
meeting even one
more why theyre all just a lot of
dimwit playboys turned out of col-
lege like so much cookies
  but where would you go to meet
any other kind helene asked
right where i am going-west
west came the astonished
echo where
  anywrhere oh dont you see
im so fed up with boys like ted
kvale or the whoops-mv-dear poet
you all but had me ankling up the
aisle with last winter i want to go
out where bob came from where
men are men
  and wild indians like you wear
moccasins not cerise sandals with
their toe nails lacquered to match
supplemented a voice from the
doorway where bob kershaw stood
grinning down at the two girls
but im for you in spite of em
linda go west if you like
  but bob helene cut in pro-
testingly
  let her go he advised ignor-
ing his wifes frantic protest after
all i understand
how she feels
  oh bob linda
had whirled about
her voice was a
hug you do
dont you oh its
not that i dont like
being with you and
helene but all this
-her glance swept
the severely mod-
ernistic breakfast
room of the ker-
shaws triplex
apartment high
above sutton place
-seems so arti-
ficial somehow
and the men i play
around with are so
   tame bob
put in obligingly taking his place at
the table i know not a thrill in
a carload and after a pause
any definite plans
 linda shook her head not
very only youve said so much
about nevada that i rather thought
id try it
  but bob helene interrupted
desperately only to be silenced by
a quick glance and her husbands
prompt and why not nevada
theres not a better spot in the
country if youre looking for thrills
there was a pause while he attacked
renascence
by lenorc fisher
oain melting the snow
 unveiling the lilies
starting to grow
 tears melting my pain
 revealing my heart
 beating again

street  smiths love tiiory magazine
his grapefruit then he turned to
linda ill tell you how about
paying a visit to your uncle andy
waltons first-class outfit that
lucky d ranch at echo canyon
and a picturesque place if i ever
saw one
  of course linda agreed eyes
shining but do you suppose he
would want me
  why shouldnt he loads of
room fifty miles from the nearest
railroad station and with no one but
his partner and a bunch of cowhands
around
  oh it sounds exciting you
do think it would be dont you
bob
  a thoughtful smile quirked the
corners of bob kershaws eyes as he
caught his sister-in-laws glowing
reflection in the mirrored table top
dusky curls shot with blue fire in
the morning sun great gray eyes
that alternately danced or smol-
dered beneath incredible lashes an
impudent nose lips that were
frankly painted and sweetly petu-
lant
  lovely and completely spoiled
was his mental summary mostly
my fault too and aloud ex-
citing well knowing uncle andy
as i do and from all accounts of
that fine young chap hes taken on
as partner id almost guarantee
that it would be
  it was linda reached the deci-
sion some ten days later and within
the first flickering moment after she
had stepped from the train at echo
canyon it was a dream come true
a close-up of the picture that had
been lingering in the far corners of
her mind for weeks the station
itself a ramshackle affair set deep
in a mountain fork beyond it a
road twisting upward to a rose-
tinted sky line and to her left on
the far side of the station platform
a group of cowboys lounging about
a hitching rail where their mounts
were tethered
  linda stared blinked and stared
again wide-brimmed stetsons
shirts that shrieked plaids gay ker-
chiefs chaps shaggy with dust
high-heeled boots and the men
themselves ranging from short to
tall all darkly tanned a half dozen
pairs of eyes staring back at her
  fully a quarter minute elapsed
before she became conscious of
them one pair in particular belong-
ing to a slim young man standing a
little apart from the rest whose
pale watchful gaze caught hers with
all the hard brilliance of the nickel
studs on his leather chaps
  there was an instant of feeling
oddly uncomfortable then she
turned away suddenly aware of the
fact that not one of the group even
slightly resembled the description
of andy walton and with the real-
ization developed an unexpected
sensation of utter desolation and
loneliness
  it was short-lived however for
almost in the next breath a tall
lank cowboy crossed the platform
to greet her with a hesitant
howdy maam lookin for some
one to which linda gathered her
scattered emotions sufficiently to
reply yes i-i expected to find
my uncle andy walton of the
lucky d ranch
  you dont say well thats
funny
  why linda demanded
because he aint here he left
for chicago a coupla days ago
chicago she exclaimed but
he knew i was coming i wired him
that i would arrive on an earlier
train than i originally planned
didnt he-didnt he even leave
word with some one she ended a
little vaguely
thrill chaser

 oh dont you see
 im so fed up with
 the boys in our
 crowd there isnt
 a man i know who
 could leave a n-
 ger print on my
 heart i want to go
 out west where
men are mem
  nots i know
of came the
prompt reply un-
less-the speaker
turned to eye a
roadster swirling
down the mountain
roa d- unless
denny can tell you
something about
it
  denny she
questioned follow-
ing his gaze
   sure one of the lucky d boys
 thats him now-nodding in the
 direction of the car that had miracu-
 lously reached a lower level in
 safety and was racing toward them
and mad as hops likely because
hes late with the mail
   in the minutes following lindas
heart did queer things and all be-
cause of a total stranger at first
she told herself it was due to the

street  smiths love story magazine
devil-may-care ease with which he
drove the car the expert sureness
which brought him about the final
curve and to an abrupt halt almost
at the edge of the station platform
then the instant he sprang out
she knew better
  the feeling went deeper than a
momentary thrill it was something
about the man himself-tall deep-
chested in his cowboy regalia
something about his eyes that were
steely-gray and keen in his lean sun-
burned face
  hi denny lindas compan-
ion hailed the newcomer andys
niece is here miss- he looked
at her questioningly
  carroll linda supplemented
stepping forward a little breath-
lessly linda carroll mr wal-
ton was expecting me
  yes i know but didnt you re-
ceive his telegram was the quick
response it should have been de-
livered to you on the train
  oh a faint flush crept up in
lindas cheeks it probably would
have only i left the train and flew
part way because- she almost
said because i couldnt wait to get
here but changed it quickly to
because i dont like trains theyre
too pokey
  thats too bad steely-gray
eyes were taking quick note of the
suitcases and overnight bag ranged
beside her because im afraid
that is the only way youll be able
to leave
  leave linda gasped but i
cant i mean ive just come and
surely there must be some place to
stay until my uncle returns
  im afraid he wont be return-
ing right away you see his son in
chicago is pretty ill so it may be
a week or more before he gets back
of course you would be more than
welcome at the lucky d if-
  if what linda demanded
when he halted uncertainly
  if he hadnt sold it to his part-
ner just before he left
  sold it then he wont be re-
turning to the ranch
  no hes quit ranching to at-
tend to his mine over in a place
called silver city
  linda thought a moment then
hell probably go there
  yes so you see-
  i do came lindas decisive in-
terruption i see that the sensible
thing is for me to go over there and
wait for him
  but you cant do that denny
objected you dont understand
it isnt a regular city just one of
those places that sprang up
quickly
  marvelous her face was sud-
denly radiant i always wanted to
see a mining camp the sort that
grew overnight theres a hotel of
sorts i suppose
you could call it that how-
ever i dont think you ought to go
fine she declared i always
adore places other people disap-
prove of
   but miss carroll its all of sixty
miles from here fifty by car and
the rest on horseback over the
roughest kind of trail i know i
just came from there
  and you are going back now
  perhaps after i leave this mail
sack but i tell you-
  please she pouted dont
try because my mind is made up
the point is will you be kind enough
to take me back with you
  if you insist he said shortly
but i still claim its not the place
for a girl no women in camp and
the men a pack of hard-looking
characters i wouldnt be responsi-
ble for what might happen to you
which makes the picture per-
thrill chaser

feet she tossed at him pertly be-
cause i draw the line at having any
one responsible for me by the way
where do we change to horses
  at my place
  great ill get into riding togs
there and to his very apparent
dismay she picked up her overnight
case turned to the lank cowboy to
add with a devastating smile
would you mind awfully putting
the rest of my baggage in the rum-
ble seat and started for the road-
ster at a brisk pace
  five minutes later they were off
denny at the wheel linda beside
him for the first few miles she
plied him with questions but pres-
ently his gruff replies mostly in
monosyllables stemmed the tide of
her enthusiasm and she finally re-
lapsed into a silence matching his
own one that held except for an
exchange of casual remarks until
they drew up at the rear of a ram-
bling log cabin which denny an-
nounced was their destination
  ducky place was her thought
as she sped inside to change and
after an appreciative inventory
just the sort one reads about
plenty of huge comfy chairs bear-
skin rugs that make you want to lie
down and roll and what a fireplace
im half tempted to announce that
ill do my waiting right here
  but she didnt ten minutes
later she was outside again and
with the contents of her baggage
transferred to dennys duffel bag
and that strapped on behind his sad-
dle they were on their way denny
grim-eyed handsome in the lead
  why did uncle andy call his
ranch the lucky d she ventured
finally and because his slience net-
tled her what does it stand for
  lucky dice he replied over his
shoulder because he won it on a
seven up
  hot cat did they really shoot
crap for ranches in the old days
ill say and with gambling
legal now the stakes are even more
insane especially in a place like sil-
ver city where men and morals
dont seem to be any too well ac-
quainted
  linda flushed you mean they
gamble for unusual stakes she
asked uneasily
  for any came the blunt retort
theyre a bad-looking lot and i
meant it when i said it wasnt the
spot for a girl
  oh was lindas sole comment
and again the conversation lagged
to a point where she was uncom-
fortably alone with her reflections
until at last its all too utterly ab-
surd she told herself hinting at
ridiculous things that would never
happen in a civilized country hes
just trying to throw a scare prob-
ably because he doesnt like me
or perhaps-her pulse quickened
perceptibly at the thought-per-
haps hes acting this queer way be-
cause he does maybe i sneaked up
on his heart and he doesnt know
quite what to do about it some
western men are like that bob
said so and the way he looks at
me every now and then might mean
almost anything
  presently to test the theory and
for several other vague and unana-
lyzed reasons she said aloud and in
her most captivating manner are
you really one of those strong silent
types one hears about out here or
is it just a pose to put the city child
in an awed frame of mind before
she meets all the big bad men
neither he replied coolly if
you must know i am simply call-
ing myself an idiot for getting mixed
up in a situation of this sort
really little flames leaped
into her eyes well i fail to see

street  smiths love story magazine
how this could be termed a situa-
tion or develop into one you were
merely returning to silver city and
i insisted on being taken along
when we arrive you can wash your
hands of me
  it may not be as simple as all
that was his irritating reply
  why not whats the weighty
problem and when his answer
was not immediately forthcoming
she mocked one lone woman in
a mining camp i expect of all the
bosh i suppose you think ill have
the entire population muttering in
their beards
  well you can make a joke of it
if you like was his terse comment
but you may change your mind
after you get there
  in something less than two hours
linda did even the approach was
desolate and forbidding an incline
stretch up a barren mountain so
steep that looking ahead was equally
as terrifying as glancing backward
then the summit and a sharp dip
with the trail zigzagging down the
very brink of rocky ledge to a
sprawling plateau
  ugh scary-looking place even
at dusk linda reflected viewing
the dingy log buildings and scatter-
ing of dejected shacks maybe i
shouldnt have come after all
  the thought grew as they dis-
mounted in front of a bleak two-
story structure labeled hotel and
proceeded up the steps almost at
the top linda caught dennys arm
who is that man she demanded
indicating a slim skulking figure
who had at that moment left a group
of loungers and was disappearing
around the corner of the porch
he looks like the same pale-eyed
sinister individual who was staring
at me so queerly at the station
couldnt be the same denny
hurried her inside this is an en-
tn
 i
tirely different bunch and to the
rotund individual behind the desk
a front room for miss carroll
andy waltons niece jake and
shed like dinner upstairs
  oh no linda interposed i
want dinner-
  upstairs denny repeated it
firmly and before she could protest
further he had the key and was pi-
loting her to the second floor
  inside the crudely furnished room
linda whirled on him what did
you say that for she demanded
im not afraid of a handful of pros-
pectors even if they are rough-look-
ing why ive eaten in plenty of
speakeasies back home that were
worse than anything here could be
and you are privileged to eat in
as many more as you like without
interference from me when you re-
turn denny replied calmly but
as long as i am under the same roof
ls-a
thrill chaser

i meant it when i said silver city wasnt the spot for a girl men
and morals dont seem to be any too well acquainted there
you wont go into the camp mess
room
indeed lindas eyes flashed
and how long will that be
ls-a
  one night only he had re-
moved a small bundle of personal
belongings from the duffel bag and
turned away im leaving for my

street  smiths love story magazine
plaoe first thing to-morrow morning
and ill be glad to leave here
oh the color fled from lin-
das cheeks then you-you came
licre just to bring me she faltered
  well you insisted on coming
didnt you his eyes were stern
liis voice impatient as he lit an oil
lamp and placed it on the shabby
dresser
  yes and i do thank you a lot
only-her heart had left its accus-
tomed place and was sinking rap-
idly-only t-i wont be seeing
you again will i
  probably not he was on his
way out of the room however if
you should want me ill be just
across the hall better blow out
your light pretty quick or youll be
eaten by mosquitoes and with
that and a brief good night he
 stalked out
   for all of ten seconds she stared
after him then thoughtfully re-
luctantly she tossed her felt hat
onto the bed and fell to unpacking
there was but one interrupting a
waddling chinaman bearing supper
on a tray and with that finished
and the duffel bag emptied she
faced the prospect of a lonely eve-
ning with weary rebellion
   ffine ending for what should have
been a perfect day was her petu-
lant reflection
  she blew out the light tossed a
pillow onto the sill and dropped
upon it face on folded arms she
lay there gazing out upon the dark-
ened landscape with things on her
mind things that had never been
there before-a rambling log cabin
bearskin rugs two huge chairs
drawn up before a mammoth fire-
place
  drowsily her fancy wove a pic-
ture of a tall blond young man
with stern eyes sitting in one of the
chairs of herself in the other
flames flickering low-lower as her
eyelashes grew heavier music drift-
ing through finally a moment of
breath-taking reality as the man
rose bent over her and all but
touched her waiting lips
  denny denny she awoke to
the sound of his name intermingled
with raucous laughter and the tinny
jangle of piano keys came upright
wondering in that brief moment
whether it had been her own voice
calling or some one elses then
having her mind suddenly distracted
by a bellowed conversation from be-
low she turned again to the win-
dow to catch the full drift of its
meaning
  a half minute ticked by while she
listened heart pounding the blood
flying to her cheeks then an in-
stant of uncertainty and in the next
she had scrambled off the bed fled
to dennys door and was tapping
frantically
  its linda she whispered to the
gruff inquiry inside the room she
choked out oh i-its outrageous
-fantastic i tell you i wouldnt
believe such a tiling could happen
but it has
  what has he was risen and
was facing her across a paper-
strewn table whats wrong
  everything those great hulk-
ing brutes actually planning to roll
dice for me-mel and calling you
to get in on the game
 oh so that was what they
wanted he was surveying her
with irritating calmness
  at first i thought it must be
some sort of joke she went on
tremulously it was all so-so in-
credible so utterly ridiculous and
then- she paused for breath
and presently added in desperation
well arent you going to-to do
something about it are you just
going to stand there
thrill chaser

  what do you expect me to do
he inquired with exasperating equa-
nimity challenge the crowd sin-
gle-handed shoot up the place
oh please she begged dont
be like that this is as serious as
it is crazy i know i was foolish to
come and that i told you to wash
your hands of me but now im
asking you to forget that and help
me out of the mess surely there
must be some way
  there is i could join the game
if i won that would settle things
but you might lose no that
would be too risky she thought
a minute then ill tell you
why not go down pretend to be
looking on then slip away and sad-
dle the horses i could skip down
the back way and meet you
  but there isnt a back way he
told her i looked when i went to
stable our mounts
  then ill drop from your win-
dow
  and break your neck
  i wouldnt she ran over to
gauge the distance then faced him
breathlessly think your pony
could take it if i lit in the saddle
yes but-
  but nothing-that will shorten
the drop ill pack and return here
give a low whistle when youre
ready
  but linda its two stories from
the ground you couldnt make it
without hurting yourself there
was genuine alarm in his voice
  nonsense stunts like that are
my special hobby her cheeks
glowed come on lets get go-
ing and suiting the action to the
word she whisked from the room
and across the hall to gather up her
belongings
  presently she was back a glance
at the table told her that be had
left a bundle to be included in her
own she stuffed it inside the duf-
fel blew out the light and stole to
the window to wait heart pounding
after what seemed an interminable
time a whistle sounded faintly from
below and she swung the bag over
the sill an instant later she slid after
it there was a moment of hang-
ing precariously fingers gripping the
ledge then with a half twist she
let go and dropped expertly into the
saddle
  good girl denny applauded
softly as she controlled the ponys
plunging reaction and they started
off straight on head for the
ledge
  think theyve missed us yet
linda asked after a bit
  not a chance theyre too busy
rolling dice
  then-whats that almost in
the instant of her speaking a shot
rang out followed in quick succes-
sion by four more somewhere over
lindas head a bullet whined and
she saw her companion clutch at his
stetson
  denny youre not hurt she
called in quick alarm
  no and with little thanks to
some idiot he whirled snatched
her ponys bridle and started the
mustangs on a wild gallop
  but this isnt the way we came
she protested as he forced her on
ahead into a cut through the moun-
tain
  i know its longer but safer
a bullet could pick us off that ledge
like birds from a branch keep go-
ing and ride low its ten to one
they wont follow but we cant take
chances
  they didnt except for a brief
interval on the sharp up grades
they kept their mounts at top speed
meanwhile two additional shots
had sounded then silence fi-
nally when they reached a trail

street  smiths love story magazine
linda remembered and she was
about to swing into it denny called
sharply not that way turn
left im taking you over to the
lucky d
  she pulled up short but i dont
want to go there you said-
  never mind what i said he
had ridden up beside her were
going just the same at least you
wont be alone over there
  and i wont be alone in your
cabin either was her prompt re-
minder youll be with me
thats the trouble
 you mean it wouldnt be
proper she tossed back well
right now im just a little fugitive
from a mining gang and not inter-
ested in proprieties moreover i
draw the line on galloping up to a
strangers door at this hour to de-
mand shelter especially when i can
be more comfortable in your cabin
where i left my baggage and
with a quick flip of her reins she
swung her pony impudently about
and started over the right-hand
trail leaving denny no choice but
to follow
  thanks to moonlight and capable
mounts they made excellent time
but it was almost eleven oclock
when they finally reached the cabin
and linda all but fell into dennys
arms getting out of the saddle
  tired arent you he remarked
when they were inside and he had
lighted a lamp you ought to be
after that hectic ride
  more cold than tired she
tossed her hat onto a chair and
crossed to the great open fireplace
where denny had already piled a
huge log onto a foundation of
lighted kindling funny how
chilly the nights are after that bak-
ing sun and presently raising her
enchanting eyes teasingly to his
cozy here isnt it now arent
you glad that i drew the line at go-
ing to the ranch
  he didnt reply at once and then
his answer wasnt in words it came
in a lightning gesture as he swept
her into his arms captured her lips
with a swift and unnerving violence
then released them only long enough
to say and maybe you wont draw
the line at this-and this-and
this punctuating each breath-
taking interlude with kisses that
were less scorching but infinitely
more compelling finally he put her
from him voluntarily left her stand-
ing there facing him a hand to her
trembling lips
  oh i-i hate you she burst out
after a long silence and because she
was so terrifically afraid she might
say what was really in her heart
you-youre a beast
  im not and you know it his
eyes met hers sternly and squarely
you asked for just what hap-
pened
  asked for it she scrubbed at
her mouth in outraged spoiled-child
fashion why i never
  you did he was back to the
flames towering over her with
your eyes your lips your attitude
all day-daring me oh i know
your type the east is full of them
the kind that gets a kick out of
leading a fellow on and playing safe
at it youre just a little thrill
chaser
im not she whipped back
then why did you insist on re-
turning to my cabin and why did
you want to go to silver city with
me in the first place
  because i thought it would be
nice to wait there for my uncle
she fibbed neatly and as for com-
ing back here-well i just liked the
cabin thats all but i do draw the
line at being-kissed she ended in
sudden confusion
thrill chaser

  then ill ask you to draw an-
other one that will keep us far
enough apart so there wont be any
danger of its happening again
denny strode to the center table
jerked out a drawer and snatched
up a piece of white chalk with vol-
canic determination here draw
a dividing line-indicating the
middle of the room ill keep
strictly to the right side which gives
me the built-in bunk on the ground
floor and you may have the rest
with a bedroom off the balcony
im sure you will like it he added
with caustic politeness its a new
addition with locks that make it
absolutely safe in fact at a glance
no one would dream there was a
room up there
  in the brief silence following
their glances met and clashed then
linda tossed her head audaciously
and taking the chalk marked a line
up to and across the center table
ending with a flourish at the oppo-
site baseboard and thanks for
giving me the kitchen too thats
a real break however ill be lion-
hearted and feed you at least three
times a day-on your side of the
table of course she finished heart
doing a tap dance at the prospect
  but the next instant her hopes
crashed for he returned stiffly
thanks but i know you will be
relieved to hear there will be only
one meal to prepare an early break-
fast so well be sure to make the
station in time to flag the morning
train and now ill wish you good
night and pleasant dreams
  as though they could be the
thought followed linda- forlornly up
the short spiral staircase to her bal-
cony room as though i could
even sleep knowing ill have to
leave and with my heart breaking
and it is she sobbed in despair
during the interlude while she dis-
robed bathed and donned a man-
darin suit that was the direct oppo-
site of her mood being a chinese
symphony in rainbow embroidery
on an orange background denny
was right i have been just a little
thrill chaser but i wasnt with him
it was love-from the first i know
it now he s-stepped right out of
that roadster into my heart and
hes there to s-stay
  weeping she blew out the lamp
slipped in between the sheets and
turned miserably to hide her tears
in the pillow oh i do love him
-i do she choked not that it
will ever come to anything with his
despising me the way he does but
id rather die than go away-and i
dont know w-what to do oh if
only something would happen
  in a little less than an hour some-
thing did she would have said that
she hadnt closed her eyes but in
the instant of opening them she
realized she must have slept real-
ized too that the bellowing voice
which had wakened her was strange
and threatening and that dennys
tone rising in crisp contrast had a
frightening quality one that brought
her out of bed and barefoot to the
door where she could peer into the
room below
  there was denny facing her
hands lifted palms up looking very
tall and grim in his wool shirt and
corduroys there was a second fig-
ure too in leather chaps a menac-
ing and familiar figure holding
something in one extended hand
while the other hung fisted at his
side
  it took linda all of ten seconds
to grasp that the something was
a gun leveled at dennys heart and
that the slim young man was re-
ferring to herself when he said i
tell you she did come with you i
saw two horses ride toward that
in a lightning gesture he swept her into his arms captured
her lips with a swift and unnerving violence and kissed her
again and again ob i-i hate youi she cried you-
youre a beast
mountain and the girl was on your
pinto
so youre the cur who put a bul-
let through my hat hoping it
was my skull
dennys eyes were
flinty his chin
hard well much
obliged slim but
well settle that
at another time
right now-
im giving or-
ders came the in-
terruption in a
snarl that made
lindas blood turn
to ice and sent her
on tiptoe to the
balcony rail this
time ive got the
upper hand and
im going to pull
a deal that will line my pockets with
enough dough for a lifetime all in
one nice easy swoop get me
kicked out of a foremans job will
street  smiths love story magazine
thrill chaser

you well both you and andy are
going to pay plenty for that deal
you wouldnt have been kicked
out if you had been on the level
you filthy cattle rustler denny
fired back as for making andy
or me pay what has that to do with
your ridiculous demand to see miss
carroll and at this hour
  plenty because im planning
to kidnap her and take you along
too just as an afterthought and to
divert suspicion from myself i had
the kidnaping planned right after
andy said she was coming and
since you chose to make that im-
promptu get-awray from the hotel
to-night with her in tow the scheme
ought to work out swell especially
when itll be your handwriting that
goes to andy and her folks demand-
ing the ransom of course he
added with a flourish of his gun if
i get good results i may let you live
to tell the tale and then again
maybe i wont
  and you think ill write your
rotten notes denny ground out
why you-
  get back there undo them fin-
gers and keep em high slim
barked weve done too much
talking already without getting any-
wrhere and a little more might make
me plug you first and figure how
much i needed you afterward but
right now i need that carroll dame
a darned sight more so come clean
and tell me where you hid her
linda didnt hear any more her
mind that had grasped every word
with terrifying clarity had reached
a pitch where even threats ceased to
have meaning they were just so
many words sliding through her
brain and above them a voice was
pounding do something-now-
now
  she stared wildly head swimming
the room turning upside down and
because one object was less famil-
iar than the rest it caught her eye
and stopped spinning it was a
huge cartwheel with a polished rim
dotted at the spoke ends with oil
lamps and hung by chains that
merged into one a crude but pic-
turesque chandelier which resumed
its rightful place as the room
stopped swirling and lindas
stunned mind snapped into action
  of course-just the thing a
leap from the balcony to the chan-
delier a surprise drop on that
menacing figure below bringing it
to the ground gun and all diffi-
cult yes but not impossible for she
had seen the stunt pulled time and
again on a movie set there was a
chance to be sure that tihe gun
might go off but more than a gam-
blers chance the shot would go
wild perfect plan if it worked
  the bare flesh beneath her orange
pajamas chilled at the thought of
that initial leap even her fingers
clutching the rail trembled but it
was a pair of steady gray eyes that
measured the distance from rail to
cartwheel a brave heart that shut
her mind to the consequences if she
failed and opened it deliberately to
the situation below in time to hear
slim rasp out and i tell you you
got just thirty seconds to produce
that girl tens gone now and in
twenty more youll be laid out like
one of your rugs one-two-
  there was a whirl of legs as linda
crossed the rail an orange streak
shooting into space then a mighty
lurch when her fingers contacted the
wheel and the floor rushed up to
meet her bringing bedlam with it
in a mingling of shouts and oaths
a gun thundering then oblivion
  darling-darling it was an
anguished call the pressure of ten-
der strong arms that finally
brought linda to a wavering con-

street  smiths love stoiy magazine
sciousness oh my sweet speak
to me linda precious
  denny she whispered oh
dearest youre hurt
  just a scratch where the bullet
grazed my clieek but-you-youre
all right
  yes she wriggled experi-
mentally probably a little black
and blue but- she raised ab-
ruptly on one elbow and finding
herself in a huge bed in a strange
room added in sudden bewilder-
ment where am i
 at the lucky d ranch we
brought you here a half hour ago
but details later right now im
interested in only one thing did
you mean it when you called me
dearest a moment ago oh say
you did linda he pleaded say
you love me-just a little ive
lived an eternity since i saw you
make that terrible leap i know you
did it to save my life and im no
end grateful but what if something
had happened to you
  or you she added the hunger
in her eyes matching his own oh
denny ive been such a little fool
no darling youve been brave
adorable and much too good for the
blundering fellow who loved you the
minute he saw you this morning
but tell me you do care for me
she told him lips to his arms
about his neck clasping him as
tightly as he clasped her while sec-
onds melted in the magic of kisses
and it was not until minutes later
that she finally thought to ask
but slim denny-what became of
him and what made that chan-
delier come down tell me all
  o k he sat down on the bed
and settled her comfortably against
him beginning with the chande-
lier i might say that the idea of
having it raised and lowered on a
rope wrapped around nails on the
side wall was my own invention and
working nicely until you turned
acrobat then the nails gave way
and slim got the works
  linda paled you mean he is
dead
  no-very much alive in fact
but considerably damaged and now
in the bunk house being patched up
by some of the boys you see a
couple of them at silver city be-
came suspicious when slim followed
us over the mountain and they rode
after him wthen they discovered
that we werent at the ranch they
went on to my cabin arriving just
in time to find you unconscious and
me half crazy for fear you might be
worse than that
 silly boy linda teased
grumpy and stern for hours then
suddenly-
  dont he begged remind me
what a chump ive been i should
have told you the truth about bobs
scheme right off
  bobs scheme linda came up-
right in his arms wthat was that
a wild attempt to show you the
west as you imagined it was-hard
riding a tough mining camp rough-
necks rolling dice with your honor
at stake he grinned in other
words a possible cure for the thrill
chaser the original plan called for
andy to take you over to silver city
on some pretext or other but when
he was called away and bob w-ired
me to arrange everything at the last
minute well he had been so won-
derful in getting me a job out here
wthen i needed a start that i just
couldnt let him down
 you mean-
  that the whole deal wras a
frame-up staged by a company of
actors on location bob got the idea
when andy wrote that some movie
outfit had leased his mining property
for a western naturally the
thrill chaser

plan called for a breath-taking flip
of the dice as a finish in which i
would win and save you from the
pack however your idea of slip-
ping away appealed to me more and
i had planned to tell you the whole
story on the way back to the ranch
then the bullets started zipping
and not knowing that slim was
around i couldnt imagine what was
up and decided not to say anything
until i found out later i made
such a mess of everything that i
thought the only sensible move was
to let you return wire helene to
pull the house party as originally
planned and follow you east to try
my luck at winning you there
 helene-house party linda
faltered you know my sister
and to dennys quick nod oh
then you must be that interesting
young man she tried to tell me
about
   interested you mean ive
wanted to know you ever since ted
sent me your snapshot taken at our
southampton place i even wrote
helene to fix it for me when she
and bob took our house for the
summer
  your house
wide
 yes im courtney kvale
didnt you know but of course
not the boys here call me denny
lindas eyes were
short for dennison my middle
name andy suggested it when i
first came said courtney sounded
too park avenue for a cowboy
but you are one arent you
linda raised eager eyes to his
  i was at first later andy made
me his partner and just before he
went east i arranged to buy his in-
terest in the lucky d which means
that youll be a ranchers wife now
darling but you wont mind that
will you he pleaded
  mind it lindas heart pranced
ill adore it but if you really
loved me so much she whispered
nestling close why did you ask me
to draw that horrid chalk line and
tell me to keep on my side of it
denny smiled a little well at
the time i probably imagined i was
afraid to trust myself too close to
you honey but now i can think
of a much better reason
  and that is she asked softly
for a long minute he looked
deeply at her then his head bent
down his arms closed tightly about
her and he said huskily because
chalk rubs out so easily precious
and in the next instant his lips
flamed to hers in the burning ecstasy
of first love a love which dennys
kisses were promising would endure
forever transforming life into a glo-

barbara sat on a fallen tree
trunk near the edge of the
woods and turned her back
upon the sunset what time had she
for sunsets in this complete moment
of humiliation now that shed had
time to realize the ridiculous depths
to which she had sunk she felt
more ashamed than she had early in
the afternoon when the miserable
thing had happened
from the veranda of pine lodge
came the chatter of voices the late
summer guests were gathering for
their evening fun-bridge dancing
a group around the piano perhaps
singing oh susannah with bill
hamptons deep voice in the lead
 barbara put her brown hands
over her ears to shut out any pos-
sibility of hearing that voice she
never wanted to hear it again
never never and yet the muffled
echo of it sent an unwanted thrill
through her
  a finger of sunlight curious per-
cornflower-blue
by phyllis a whitney
c ornflower-blue

haps of this rebel who refused to
join in the sunset rites slanted
through the trees seeking her out
with its rosy touch it tinted the
pale-blue cornflowers of her thin
dress and caught a tiny gleam of red
in the neat brown coil of hair at the
nape of her neck
  barbara shrugged away from the
warm touch and moved farther into
the shade she wished that dark-
ness would come down and blot her
out completely if only that ter-
rible laughter would stop ringing in
her ears-her friend adelas high
and scornful bill hamptons
hearty with amusement
  if only she could have killed her-
self broken her neck or even an
arm so that they would have been
sorry for her but just to fall from
the back of an old nag like maude
and land practically on her head in
a soft bank of pine needles it was
too absurd
  she flushed at the memory
  even then it mightnt have been
so bad if bill hadnt come originally
from montana where it appeared
people were born with their feet in
stirrups bill simply couldnt under-
stand any one who wasnt able to
sit a horse and then to make mat-
ters worse there was adela who
could ride like a rodeo queen
  the simile was bills and it had
amused adela tremendously adela
ash heiress to goodness only knew
how many millions and accustomed
to the most exclusive hunt parties in
america being likened to a rodeo
queen she had laughed until bills
brown face had become one enor-
mous blush and then she had dug
her heels into sorcerers sides so
that he had gone off down the trail
like the wild streak of lightning he
was and bill had been hard put to
catch her
  that was when barbara had tried
desperately to follow and had dug
her own heels into maudes well-
covered ribs maude who had been
nibbling an appetizer by the way-
side had been startled and had
dashed clumsily after the others with
great gallumps that made very little
speed and served only to deposit
barbara ignobly in her bed of pine
needles
  theyd returned after a minute or
two and found her there before
shed collected her wits sufficiently
to sit up and pick the cones and
needles out of her hair would she
ever forget bills deep-blue amused
eyes as hed sat in his saddle look-
ing down at her eyes that had
somehow the look of the west in
them and made her feel that if she
gazed long enough she might find
the reflection of hazy montana dis-
tances in their depths
  hurt hed said and she could
see his chest shaking with laughter
that threatened to break free at any
moment
  she was hurt she felt sore all
over inside and out her hairpins
were coming loose and so she was
certain were her teeth and by
looking cross-eyed at the end of her
nose she could see the big lump of
earth on its tip but she couldnt
sit there and ache and wait for his
laughter to come adela was al-
ready laughing and that was bad
enough
  she managed a smile that she
knew was lopsided and clambered
unsteadily to her feet
  oh no she said im not hurt
a bit
  she hadnt meant to say anything
so ordinary shed wanted to make
some completely flip and non-
chalant remark that would show
them how unimportant a fall from a
horse could be but she wasnt like
adela who could think of smart

street  smiths love story magazine
wisecracks on the spur of any mo-
ment she just stood looking up at
bill with eyes that felt suddenly
enormous because of the tears that
were beginning to fill them much
as she wanted to she couldnt look
anywhere else she stared at bill
until his laughter spilled over and
crushed her to the last humiliating
depths
  your face looks so odd babs
dear adela said i think maude
must have stepped on it havent
you a hanky
  bills laughter broke at that
deep enormous shattering so that
the very pines shook with the echo
barbara kept widening her eyes be-
cause if she squeezed them shut ever
so slightly the furious scalding
tears would spill over
  and then bills laughter stopped
as suddenly as it had begun and he
took an immense snow-white
neatly folded handkerchief from the
pocket of his shirt and handed it to
her
  here he said gently take
mine
  she had taken it from him very
dignified very stiff said a polite
thank you and turned about on
the trail
  hi called adela you forgot
your horse
  but she was running by then-
wildly blindly through the
woods stumbling catching herself
against the trunk of a tree then
running on again she hadnt
stopped until shed slammed the
door of her room shut behind her
and thrown herself on the bed to fill
bills handkerchief completely with
muddy tears
  now hours later here on the
edge of the woods she could be
calm about the whole affair but no
less depressed from the first she
had been an impulsive little fool
adela had so obviously wanted to go
riding alone with bill but bill had
been polite enough to ask them both
and she had accepted in the face of
adelas disapproval
  adela had every right to dis-
approve had she not made this
vacation possible by paying all
barbaras expenses just for the sake
of barbaras company it was
wrong to suspect sometimes that
adela enjoyed having her along be-
cause she was like a quiet brown
little wren and set off adelas blond
beauty to perfection thoughts like
that werent loyal adela could be
so very sweet and generous and
most of the time she was had she
not befriended barbara back in
school when she was just a nobody
and adela the most popular girl in
their group
  it was just when some one crossed
adelas will that the knife edge
showed
  there was a light crackling of
steps on the path behind and bar-
bara turned about it was adela
her golden head rising from crisp
white folds of organdy and a scent
of jasmine following her
  feel better after your prince-of-
wales she asked gayly bill and
i nearly died laughing i think even
sorcerer smiled
  just so maude didnt join in the
merriment barbara said grimly
  then adelas expression changed
come along she said more kindly
wed better get started a canoe
ride after dark isnt much fun when
there isnt a moon
  barbara stood up listlessly are
we going for a canoe ride
  just you and i i was invited
for a swim but i told bill id better
stay with you this evening after
all youve had a bad day
  adela went ahead down the path
toward the lake and barbara found
c ornflower-blue

herself following indifferently so
bill had invited adela for a swim
well why not she was a marvel-
ous swimmer a spectacular swim-
mer with all the graceful diving and
perfect strokes that went to make
up an exhibition performance while
she barbara had only two or three
steady plugging strokes that were
not notable for form but that man-
aged to keep her above water
  adela was chattering on and on
about bill barbara found herself
listening suddenly intent
  so here i am babs darling-
head-over-heels in love and with a
wild man from montana
  some deep secret little thing in
barbaras heart winced and twisted
  youve been in love before she
said dryly
  adela gave a quick backward
glance over one shoulder the
child grows cynical but its the
real thing this time i might even
go through with it and marry him
and live on a ranch
  dont be weird hell have to
give up the ranch not enough
money to keep it going id get dad
to give him a real job
  has-has bill said anything
yet
 no of course not adela
tossed her bright head thats
what makes the game exciting he
likes me tremendously but he
doesnt know yet that he cant live
without me
  the path dipped abruptly toward
the water and they could see the
landing below them framed by the
sweeping branches of a willow the
canoes bobbed with every ripple of
the shining water and the boatman
sat at the end of the wharf his legs
dangling a corncob pipe in his
mouth he saw them coming and
stood up
  but adela was in no hurry she
turned suddenly and looked up at
barbara on the path above
  ill win of course ive never
yet lost anything that i wanted ter-
ribly and i want bill i want him
so much that i wouldnt stand for
interference-from any one not
even you
  barbara stared not even me
what in the world do you mean
you know what i mean do
you suppose i didnt see those moon-
struck eyes of yours this afternoon
when you sat there on the ground
staring at him as though youd
never seen the man before i wont
have you making yourself pitiful
it may be your only weapon but
ydire not to use it hes such a
big soft ninny of a man-as far as
his hearts concerned-that hed fall
in love with a caterpillar if he got
sorry enough for one
  she turned about and went down
the path to the landing all sweet-
ness now and charm so that the
boatman bustled about fetching ex-
tra pillows from the other canoes
  barbara took his horny hand
numbly and slipped into one of the
low seats she felt chilled shocked
terrified her fingers were stiff as
she dipped her paddle in the rosy
waters the canoe slid away from
the landing and out onto the wide
glassy world of the lake how
really awful of adela to accuse her
of-of making herself pitiful in order
to attract bill
  ill go home to-morrow she
said quietly its been kind of you
to bring me here but of course i
couldnt stay after this
  adela raised her paddle and
twisted about in the seat ahead so
that the canoe swayed dangerously
  dont be ridiculous i apologize
i-i lost my head for a minute it
wouldnt do at all to have you leave
suddenly in the middle of our stay

street  smiths love story magazine
ive never yet lost anything that i wanted terribly said adela and
i want bill i want him so much that i wouldnt stand for interference-
from any one not even you
  barbara was siient the trapped
feeling of terror was growing in her
heart had there been some truth
in the things adela had said had
there been some special reason for
her tears of shame and her wild
stumbling haste in the woods a
more important reason than the
fact that she had been made
ridiculous by her fall from a horse
she wielded her paddle fiercely so
that adela turned again and looked
at her in surprise
careful babs dont get ex-
cornflower-blue

cited and spill us overboard the
water looks icy to-night its get-
ting much too late for swimming at
this hour though i wouldpt admit
that to bill
  barbara controlled the motion of
her paddle and the canoe slid quietly
around a curve of the bank bring-
ing them in full view of the float
and diving board out above deep
water and at that first quick
glimpse of the float and its lone
occupant barbara knew the answer
to all her questioning
 she was in love with bill
through some cruel prank of fate
the very sight of him tall and
brown poised at the end of the
board sent a sick feeling of despair
through her body
  adelas eyes were upon bill too
and adela in the twilight was
golden-white and lovely and fragile
her bright lips were parted and her
breath came quickly as she waited
for bill to see her
  the canoe drifted along the
smooth surface and barbara found
herself leaning a little to one side so
that her own small brown face
looked up at her from the mirror of
the water what chance had a face
like that-a face that seemed all
wide eyes-against adelas golden
beauty and even if there had been
a chance even a tiny sliver of a
chance she must not take it be-
cause of the debt she owed adela
what did it matter that adela had
turned suddenly cheap and rather
dreadful when the debt she owed
stretched back through all the years
of adelas kindness
  she looked at the diving board in
time to see bills lean hard body cut
the water in a clean knife-thrust of
a dive bill did everything well-
just as adela did what a pair they
would make when she barbara
did anything spectacular it was
only because she lost her head and
followed the first call of any impulse
that stirred her that was why she
always ended in humiliation and
shame
  bill pulled himself up the ladder
of the float and waved one long arm
at the canoe
  watch this one girls its new
-just perfected
  he ran lightly out upon the
board steadied himself for an in-
stant drew a deep breath and shot
into the air up and up with all
the grace and vigor of his youth
then over and back down but the
dive was new and hed misjudged
his distance
  barbara clapped a horrified hand
to her mouth to stifle the scream
that rose as bills dark head cracked
sharply against the edge of the
board just before he disappeared
into the water she did not know
that adela was whimpering wildly
in the other end of the canoe she
did not know that she herself had
risen precariously to her feet she
knew only that her whole body
ached with the effort her eyes were
making to see down through the
center of that widening arc of rip-
ples
  then still only half conscious of
her actions she kicked off her slip-
pers and stood up on the seat of the
canoe while the boat rocked wildly
beneath her then she was in the
water adelas scream as the canoe
went over ringing in her ears
  the first shock was icy deadening
the surface of the lake closed above
her head and she could feel the
downward drag of her clothing
then she was up again cutting
through the water toward that ter-
rible place where bill had dis-
appeared a great breath of air
filled her lungs before she plunged
downward again her eyes fighting

street  smiths love story magazine
the cold black depths of the lake
  oh god let her find him let
her find him quickly before it was
too late she hacl to find him
without bill all the brightness and
life would have gone out of the
world
  she dived again and struck into
his body floating near the surface
she clutched at it wildly lifting his
head working furiously with her
feet and one free arm to keep them
both on top it seemed that she
would never get enough air to
breathe again and bill was so dead
and heavy in the water she could
feel her strength slipping weakly
away while her mind sharper than
it had ever been worked like light-
ning focusing now here now there
on every possibility of safety
  the diving float was appallingly
far away and so too was the shore
line she might make the float but
the possibility of clinging to it and
holding bill above water would be
beyond her strength the thought
of adela returned with a shock and
her eyes swept the lake and dis-
covered the overturned canoe drift-
ing steadily toward the opposite
shore for the moment there was
no sign of adela
  it would be better then to try
for land perhaps she would find
shallow water as she neared shore
she struck out valiantly her left
arm holding bills chin above water
while with her right she struggled
for a slow progress her thin dress
was heavy impeding her every
movement her heart pounded in her
ears and each gasp of breath tan-
talized her and made the next one
more difficult
  she thought of screaming but dis-
missed the idea immediately she
was too far from the hotel to be
heard above the singing and the
music and her breath was too
precious to be wasted in futile effort
  one more stroke one more gasp
of air one more tired drag of her
left arm then the whole process
must be repeated a sudden wild
movement of her burden sent a
splash of water into her mouth and
nose she choked and released her
hold for an instant backing away
in the water the clarity of her
horrified mind told her instantly
what had happened bill had re-
turned to half-consciousness and
finding himself in the water had be-
gun the natural struggles of a
drowning man
  she was frightened now more
frightened than at any moment
since that terrible crack of bills
head against the diving board
there had been a chance of reaching
safety with bill unconscious but
bill conscious was a menace to
them both a tiny spot of gold far
away toward shore caught her eye
  adela she called her voice
scarcely more than a whisper
adela help
  then bills hand closed brutally
upon one shoulder dragging her be-
neath the water as she went down
she caught a single glimpse of his
staring unseeing eyes and she knew
that in that instant-and through
no fault of his own-he was com-
pletely mad
  she struggled fiercely against the
grip that was drowning them both
twisting her shoulder wildly away
from his fingers once as they
came to the top together choking
fighting she broke away only to be
clutched again and dragged under
  when they reached the top once
more she found that she was fight-
ing insanely for her own life-as in-
sanely as poor half-conscious bill
was fighting for his and in the
horrified instant of her realization a
sudden cool reserve of strength came
ls-a
c om flower- b hie

to her and her mind cleared what
was it she had read about drowning
people being easily knocked out
  she broke away and lifted a
brown fist in the water bill
floundered toward her at once and
she struck him with all her might
straight between the eyes
 he slumped at once and she
caught his head and held it firmly
above water the remainder of her
struggle toward shore was a night-
mare of agonized effort of tiny
gasps of air coming like knife-
thrusts to her tortured lungs of
weary muscles striving to do her
bidding in the end she was barely
conscious of shallow water of mud
beneath her feet and of adelas
strong white arms dragging bill to
safety then her knees sagged and
a black wave engulfed her
  when consciousness returned she
found herself lying half out of the
water her cheek against a bank of
mud her eyes staring into the mud-
stiffened grass of the shore edge
with an effort she sat up and saw
adela on the bank above her kneel-
ing beside bills limp body working
with strong sure hands to force the
water from his lungs
  adela glanced at her sharply
are you strong enough to go for
help 
  wearily barbara dragged herself
to her feet i-i think i can make
it is he-will he-
  hell be all right
  barbara turned and stumbled to-
ward the path something was
puzzling her knocking insistently
at the back of her mind some
question to which she had to know
the answer
  adela why didnt you help
me
  dont be a fool adela tossed
her wet curly head the two of
you might have dragged me down
ls-a
if i had besides i was half
drowned myself after the sudden
way you ducked me into that icy
lake it was lucky for you that i
was able to swim for shore and was
here in time to help you in
  i see said barbara quietly
  the singers on the hotel veranda
greeted her with shocked little cries
as she strode suddenly out of the
dusk and up the steps
  why barbara my dear youre
absolutely soaked
  babs did you fall in the lake
wheres adela whats hap-
pened
  and over and over again from all
sides the word adela
  barbara steadied herself carefully
against pillar of the veranda bill
hampton was nearly drowned
adelas all right shes giving him
first aid now youd better go down
there right away-somebody-
  she swayed a little but they were
no longer listening to her words
two of the boys had vaulted the
veranda rail and the rest of the
party streamed after them she
waited a moment for her strength to
return and then went to her room
  the tall mirror on her closet door
gave back her dreadful reflection
her blue-flowered dress had been
torn half away from one shoulder
her brown hair was a limp untidy
mass caked with mud along one
cheek she slipped out of her torn
wet clothes and put on a heavy
beach robe then having soaked
some of the mud from her face she
went back to the veranda
  she was just in time to witness
the return of the crowd from the
lake they had lit torches of pine
and the flickering light fell upon up-
turned faces as the group came up
the hill bills face white and smil-
ing as he stumbled along aided by
a strong shoulder on either side

street  smiths love story magazine
dont be a fool adela tossed her head why should i have helped
you save bill the two of you might have dragged me down go to the
hotel for help quickly
adelas golden hair glinting in the	their crossed hands and she sat in
torchlight her lovely body molded	it swinging her bare feet a trium-
by her wet white dress two of the	phant young princess
boys had made a cradle for her of	she was talking her voice gay
cornflower-blue

  poor kid you mustnt blame
her and you mustnt laugh at her
ill never forget the frightened look
on her face when the canoe went
over
  a voice in the background spoke
up she might have helped you
at least
  then adela again thats not
nice of you jerry you know she
doesnt swim very well i think it
was marvelous of her to get herself
to shore and help drag bill in when
i gave out
  adela youre so generous-a
girls voice tense with worship
  and then bill suddenly hush
shes up there on the veranda
  to barbara it was as though a
sudden pit had yawned sickeningly
at her feet leaving her with the
knowledge that on all sides there
was empty space waiting to suck
her down she closed her eyes for
an instant against the dizzy
precipice
  so adela had done this to her
kind generous adela who was her
friend then she raised her lids
again and her gaze fell upon bill as
he came up the steps a warm flood
of thankfulness filled her what did
it matter-so long as bill was alive
and well
  if it was glory adela wanted-
very well she would give her glory
she would give her the thing she
wanted so desperately that she was
willing to lie and cheat for it and
when the giving was done she
barbara would be free of adela out
of her debt forever
  they came up the steps noisily
and she waited muffled and small in
the great towel-like folds of her robe
  are you all right she asked as
the two men who had been carrying
adela lowered her to the veranda
  ill say she is bill said quickly
shes got the strength and nerve
of three men i must have been a
handful out there in the lake
barbara could see adelas eyes
upon her in the lamplight from the
veranda cold watchful treacherous
  you were a handful barbara
said and adela broke in quickly
  never mind that come along
babs and help me into some dry
clothes
  well have to celebrate cried
the girl with the worshiping voice
we dont have heroines up here
every day in the week
  right agreed jerry a party
in adelas honor get you gone
woman and into your glad rags
adela with laughter on her lips
and vigilance in her eyes came
quickly across to barbara and took
her arm
  itll have to be a party for us
both i couldnt have managed
alone you know come babs
but barbara had no intention of
leaving the security of her railing
until she had taken her stand and
allayed adelas fears
  you were wonderful she said
gently i-i thought hed pull you
under for good once or twice
adela had the grace to wince but
only barbara saw bill was laugh-
ing ruefully
  you ought to have let me sink
my dear im not worth one pretty
golden hair of your head i cant
remember a thing that happened
after that crack until the time when
i came to with you working over
me but i must have been a terror
you were barbara repeated
with a reckless little laugh she
must say it now-now before this
growing weakness and nausea swept
her away i-i saw it all from the
bank if she hadnt struck you
youd have both been drowned but
she did and then pulled you in
knocked me out eh said bill

street  smiths love story magazine
brave girl did i put up any kind
of scrap when you got me to the
bank
  adela shook her bright head
you were limp as a rag when i
turned you over to babs and you
didnt even start to wake up until
i caught my breath and got to work
on you
  very gravely bill bent and kissed
her full on the lips while the others
cheered and barbara leaning
against the rail closed her eyes
against the dizziness that pulled
her down she mustnt faint not
here-not now this was adelas
moment and she must do nothing to
spoil it
  then somehow they had all
swept away and into the lodge
adela a laughing white water-sprite
in their midst barbara felt her
way to the steps and crept weakly
down them it was only a short dis-
tance to her log at the edge of the
woods and she made it on wavering
feet then she sank gratefully
down upon its mossy side and closed
her eyes
  she had done her part she was
finished she could be nothing but
a spoil-sport at the party and if she
stayed away she would never be
missed the others did not want
her she had seen their looks of de-
rision and scorn to-morrow she
would slip quietly away from pine
lodge and never see bill again
  never see him again never see
his dear brown face and laughing
eyes that was where the pain be-
gan
  a mist of tears came before her
own eyes and suddenly she was
down upon the ground beside the
log her head pillowed against one
soft arm while the sobs broke
raggedly in her throat
  she felt the light upon her before
she saw it and raised wet lids to its
glare there was some one stand-
ing there turning a flashlight upon
her
  go away she cried couldnt
they leave her alone in her misery
  sorry said bills deep voice
from beyond the gleam i didnt
mean to startle you but i had to
find you
  barbara wept into her closed fin-
gers oh why did you why
cant you go away and let me be
because bill said i had to ask
you a question or two wont you
try to answer me
  she looked up then straight into
the yellow light and he moved the
torch mercilessly and laid it upon
the log so that its long beam fell
upon his own face as well as hers
  there are one or two things i
had to know he went on and
since you saw most of what hap-
pened i wanted you to tell me
youre quite sure i wasnt conscious
at all on the beach-didnt put up
any kind of fight while you were
near me
  she shook her head wearily
adelas already told you you
were only conscious once and that
was out in the lake the rest of the
time you were just a rag doll
  i see he said gravely and sud-
denly he was kneeling there in the
grass spreading something beside
her on the log this is what
bothers me-if the only time i put
up a scrap was out in the lake when
you were completely out of reach
how do you account for the fact that
when i came to on the bank i was
clutching this in one hand
  barbara stared at the thing on
the log it was a torn scrap of blue-
flowered material-the cap sleeve
ripped from her blue dress there
was nothing to be said no explana-
tion that would serve she could
only look at it dumbly while her
c omflower-blue

heart commenced a wild pounding
in her throat
  bill took her hands gently into his
own big ones shall we go up and
spoil adelas party
  barbara started up from the log
oh no-please
  bills laugh was a joy to hear i
knew you wouldnt want to youre
too brave and sweet and honest
oh no no im not i was
afraid out there in the lake i was
afraid you were going to drown me
and i wanted desperately to live
so you continued to risk your
life to get me to safety just as you
risked it earlier to-day when it was
perfectly obvious that you were
frightened to death of a horse
thats the kind of courage we like
in the west my dear thats why
youre going back there with me
back there with you
  he was laughing again-a tender
mocking laugh do you think for
a minute that id take no for an
answer sweet little barbara ive
been trying to get you alone ever
since i met you but adela was play-
ing dragon she played it again to-
night when i asked you both for a
swim she said you were afraid of
the water when it was cold and she
didnt want to leave you and all
the time she thought i didnt know
she was lying
  but-why did you kiss her to-
night
  because she all but asked for it
because that was the pay she
wanted and so i gave it to her
right on her sweet lying lips-with
a kiss that was a lie but i didnt
kiss her the way im going to kiss
you
  big arms swept about her sud-
denly and firm lips came down upon
hers and barbara knew that never
in all her gay spoilt life had adela
ash been kissed like that
  after a long interval bill lifted her
in his arms baby he whispered
ive got to look after you from now
on off you go to bed and youre
not to get up till noon to-morrow
after that well go into the details
thatll turn you into a ranch wife
back in montana
 back in montana somehow it
sounded like home her head
drooped wearily against bills shoul-
der as he carried her toward the
lodge but her heart was singing an
endless little song of its own and
not even bill saw that in one small
brown fist she clutched for a talis-
man a tiny scrap of cornflower-blue

bride
by cordelia snow
a two-part story-part 
chapter i
  t was fall-late fall-with the
tang of coming winter in the
air tn their shrubbery-hidden
nook high on the ridge of campus
hill dawn turned in jacks circling
arms to stare before her from
smoldering misted eyes
  asters were blooming long rows
of them purple and yellow and
white they edged the winding
walks and clumped themselves
against the schools walls
  the air was sweet with the odor
of a hundred bonfires and the
waters of lake menhota shown a
blue-green opal between trees
 beauty was a pain at dawns
heart an ache in her throat
  this college on a hill this little
world within a world-how she
loved it how she loved its youth
and laughter and gayety and the
boy beside her the boy whose arms
held her the gaunt brown-faced
boy with the burning eyes and
angry lips

street  smiths love story magazine
  they had met early in the sum-
mer dawn arden and jack laird
it had been at the dunes where
dawn and her aunt had been stay-
ing jack had been a life-guard a
golden-brown god high on his throne
on lake michigans yellow sands
and dawn a violet-eyed neophyte
her seventeen-year-old worship in-
cense at his feet
  it had been love at first sight for
both an idolatrous crazy love a
love of langorous days and glamor-
ous star-lit nights of ecstasy and
wonder and bliss a love that swept
even dawns staid and thin-lipped
aunt on its surging tide
  it isnt that jack isnt a nice
boy she had grudged in answer to
dawns pleading but ill have
none of this being engaged youre
only seventeen and thats too
young you must have a year in
college-jacks college if you want
it that way and both of you free
then if you still want each other
still think youre in love-
  still want each other still think
they were in love dawn thought
of that now and snuggling herself
against jacks sweatered shoulder
pulled his cheek down to hers and
held it there while she laughed
against it tenderly pleading
  darling silly silly darling to
think of our quarreling over phil
barnes we ought to be ashamed
both of us you know hes crazy
about det henderson that hes
only dating me because dets my
roommate and theyve had a fight
over something or other and arent
speaking all he does is to pump
me about her trying to find out
what shes saying what shes doing
you should be glad its phil and not
some one else
 and- her fingers twisted
at his sweater sleeve and her long
lashes lay dark shadowed on her
flushed cheeks-its your fault

lu made you promise you wouldnt

boys a chance ive never had a
date since i came to this college i
wouldnt have broken for you

pered his love against her ears

expelled how would your aunt
lu have liked that phil barnes is
a senior hes older than you he
had no business taking you there
  every one goes to poke brians
place dawns red lips pouted the
boys to see his pretty wife and the
girls to see what makes the boys

only took me once and then only
because i asked him to

  he hesitated stared down at her
from shamed young eyes im go-
ing to tell you something dawn

that ive never breathed to a soul

ing it
  phil barnes is dangerous you

hate to tell you this as badly as you
hate to have me but its true ive
a way of knowing-a way i cant
tell but a good way phil barnes is
mixed up in a scandal thats going
to rock this school if its ever found
out
  before dawn could answer before
she could gather her shocked and
angry breath there was a step on
the walk behind them a jerk at the
bushes and phil was beside them
his good-natured weak face a
twitching mask of rage
  you jealous dirt-peddling
sneak he cried i heard you i
couldnt help myself any one
walking behind those bushes could
have heard so im mixed up in a
scandal am i well all i can say
is any scandal im mixed up in

one thats brewing about you

dawn about the way you hear

  ill tell you where this guy gets
his dope dawn and i dare him to
deny it he gets it from poke
brians wife thats where and he
gets something else from her too or
i miss my guess money
  wait now jack laird im talk-
ing and im not finished ive got
a cousin living in your town he
knows your history your mother
and father were divorced and your
mother ran away with another man
when you were a kid your grand-
mother raised you on a thirty-
dollar-a-month pension poorer
than church mice both of you yet
youve had four years in college a
fraternity and everything that goes
with it thats a lot to get out of
thirty dollars a month id say
  how about those stories that
hilda brian is seeing you through
how about those secret meetings of
yours that arent half as secret as
you seem to think they are how
about the checks with hilda brians
name on them that have passed
through the bank here things like
that get out you know and
crushes like hers-theyre common
enough heaven knows a beauti-
ful woman with more money than
she can spend and a husband too
old for her
  jacks fists were doubled threats
and his bunched muscles strained at
his sweater and corded his neck
dawn threw herself between them
her arms out she cried what
an awful thing to say about any
boy phil what a terrible thing
that he would take money from a
woman make love to her for
money wthy jack doesnt even
know hilda brian doesnt want
to
  yeah phils lips twisted into
a mocking smile how about it
laird maybe that wasnt you i
saw with hilda brian tuesday
night parked in her big blue
sedan out by the water tower
maybe it wasnt you i saw kissing
her good-by when you got out and
walked back to town
  oh i spied sure i did who
wouldnt but ive never told and
i wouldnt have told now if you
hadnt started things
  tuesday night dawn cried
and stared stupidly fascinated into
jacks pale still face tuesday
night why that was the night
you broke that date with me told
me you had to study and instead

street  smiths love story magazine
you- oh jack jack tell me
it isnt true please tell me
 afterward dawn remembered a
muscle in jacks cheek that
twitched and jumped she remem-
bered his eyes were bleak and gray
and old but then all she could
think of all she could hear was his
voice saying i-i cant tell you
it isnt true it is i-i-did meet
her i kissed her just as phil said
i did but it isnt what you believe
it is i swear it dawn i cant ex-
plain it now its-its a secret and
it isnt mine to tell give me time
give me to-night for pitys sake
dawn please
  he had been holding her to him
holding her wrists tight locked in
his fingers holding her eyes in his
but as he finished his eyes pleading
for her answer dawn jerked herself
free
  she stood for an instant swaying
on unsteady feet she was sick
with the shock stupid with it
then she heard phils ugly laughter
and her chin wtent up her shoul-
ders lifted themselves in proud de-
fiance
  it would take a lot more time
than to-night to square what
youve just acknowledged she said
that you meet hilda brian by
stealth kiss her in dark parking
places that all the time youve
been telling me you loved me
youve been two-timing me with a
woman like that a married
woman maybe even taking her
money money she steals from a
husband who trusts her
  a lot of nerve youve got talking
about phil as though anything he
could do would be as bad as that
  her fingers on phils arm swung
him with her toward the down hill
path if you want to go with me
phil she said come on im go-
ing home
  where the path swung over the
hills edge she stopped for an in-
stant to look behind her
  the setting sun sent red lights to
glint in her dusky hair and touched
the creamy pallor of her skin with a
rosy glow it lay like a golden
mist on the very air-a mist
through which shadows danced and
whirled and through which she saw
jack standing where she had left
him looking after her his broad
shoulders drooping his hands dan-
gling in loose dejection at his sides
  there were tears in her eyes she
brushed at them with angry fingers
her lips trembled and she bit them
still with pinching teeth crazy
eyes crazy lips she thought
wanting to cry for one of hilda
brians lovers crazy heart ach-
ing over a man who could treat her
so
  back in her room at last she
found det henderson sprawled on
the couch they shared together
she sobbed out her story while det
listened a cigarette held carelessly
in her hand
  deceiving me when id trusted
him so dawn wailed lying to
me breaking dates with me so he
could meet her taking money
from her-
  now listen darling-det raised
herself on an elbow and her voice
was sharp and hard-i dont be-
lieve jack is taking money from
hilda brian and neither do you
making love to her-yes theyre
all alike guys in a school like this
getting a girl to fall for them then
doing something that knocks her
faith into a million bits theyve
all got a line with some its
women with others-
  she crushed her cigarette out
against a book dusted off the ashes
stared at dawn from somber eyes
  and you say it was phil who told
forgotten bride

dawn threw herself between them crying what an awful
thing to say about any boy phil that he would take money
from a woman make love to her for money why jack
doesnt even know hilda brian doesnt want to
you all that stuff
about jack it
doesnt sound like
him some way
how did it hap-
pen he must
have been pretty
sore
dawn nodded
her eyes shamed
he was he had
overheard what jack was saying
about him about his being mixed
up in some awful scandal i didnt
mean to tell you det i-i didnt
think much about it honest i
didnt jack was just jealous be-
cause phil had taken me out to the
dells the other night he was try-

street  smiths love story magazine
ing to make me promise never to go
out with phil any more he-
  but dets fingers were pinching at
dawns arm and dawn shocked
into sudden stillness thought how
strangely old det looked and how
scared
  jack told you that jack did
he say what it was phil was mixed
up in did he say it was going to
get out did he tell you how-
when breathless questions that
det threw at dawn through fright-
ened lips questions that before
dawn could answer she had
shrugged away with her old hard
as nails air
  never mind forget it she said
and added bitterly if all youve
got against that jack of yours is an
affair with hilda brian youre
darned lucky there are worse
things a boy at school can do than
chase a woman particularly a
woman old enough to be his
mother
  thats just it dawn wailed
if she were a girl my own age id
know what to do but shes thirty-
seven phil told me and jacks
only twenty-one when boys lose
their heads over women like that-
beautiful women like hilda brian-
its awful you know it is det
and jacks crazy about her i
could see it in his eyes he stood
up for her against me told me he
had kissed her it was almost as
though he were boasting about it
and id trusted him so believed
in him
  it doesnt seem as though i
could believe in anything any more
im scared det im terribly
scared
  dets face was bleak and gray
im scared too she said but
not for the same reason and she
added listlessly the telephones
ringing dawn answer it wont
you its probably jack wanting
to make up if it is take my advice
and do it it isnt so hot this thing
of fighting with the guy you love
  with her hand over the phone
dawn whispered a little breath-
lessly its phil det he wants
to date me do you care if i go
id like to show jack he cant boss
me around
  care det snapped the word
why should i care phil and i
are through he can take a jump in
the lake as far as im concerned
tell him that for me will you
  later hunched behind the wheel
of his roadster and darting reck-
lessly in and out through the
crowded college streets phil said
det was there when i called you to-
night wasnt she i heard her talk-
ing to you what did she say
and when dawn didnt answer but
twisted miserably her cheeks an un-
happy crimson he laughed at her
through side twisted lips
  you might as well tell me he
jeered it couldnt be any worse
than the things shes told me her-
self
  she said dawm answered un-
willingly that she was through
that you could take a jump in the
lake as far as she was concerned
and i wish you wouldnt ask me to
repeat stuff to you phil i dont
like to why dont you ask det her-
self what she thinks of you if you
want to know
  i dont have to ask her phil re-
plied moodily i know she cant
see me for dust well-he put his
arm around dawns shoulders and
drew her close-im not jumping
into the lake to-night for det hen-
derson or any one else not when
ive got a sweet kid like you to ride
with me and theres a moon like
that one shining in the sky
forgotten bride

  heres to you mr moon and
he kissed her and dawn let him
laughed against his lips a crazy
wild laugh that tore at her throat
two-timing she told herself de-
fiantly thats a game two can
play at jack laird
  they had left the town behind
them the pavement stretched be-
fore them a white ribbon against
the dark night sky in the head-
lights glow fences whizzed by
trees became shadowy fleeing
ghosts waving ghostly greeting with
naked arms
  cars bright eyes in the blackness
bore down on them blazed at them
and were gone
  they came at last to a place
where the road forked and where a
sign showing white in the moon-
light pointed to the dells
phil slowed his car he said do
i have to ask you where were go-
ing he grinned and dawn an-
swered no it would be the
dells for me to-night- if i had to
crawl
  it was a sprawling log-ribbed
house the dells set far back from
the road in a grove of trees a
graveled drive leading up to its
brightly-lighted entrance made a
horseshoe curve back to the high-
way again but at the side fenced
in by rustic shrub edged rails was
a gate marked private because
she had been there before dawn
knew that it was through that gate
one reached the home of poke
brian and his wife hilda and
shivering she stared at it morbidly
curious
  anything that concerned hilda
brian sent hate chills down her
spine
  inside the crowded tavern
waiters were hurrying back and
forth threading their way between
the close packed dancing throng
there was the throb and beat of
music soft laughter the clink of
glasses and the snap of corks and
from behind a baize-covered door
the whir of the roulette wheel and
the click of the ivory balls settling
into their tiny groves
  phil found a table it was far
off to the side of the room and near
a door marked private too
dawn knew about that door as she
had known about the gate that it
led to the house where hilda lived
and she stared at it with the same
hate chills pricking her
  phil gave their order and the
waiter brought it put it on the
table before them dancing couples
passed them joggled their arms
there were people from town and
people from school some dawn
knew and some she didnt but phil
seemed to know them all and an-
swered their nods as he sipped his
beer and followed with nervous
tapping fingers the musics beat
  poke brian himself making his
regular rounds sauntered by and
stopping not far beyond them
leaned carelessly against the wall
poke brian was a huge man with
the body of a wrestler and a hand-
some battered face and dawn
stared at him fascinated
  following her eyes phil said and
smiled wryly and jack laird is
playing around with that guys wife
a fat chance hell have if poke
brian ever finds out why crazy as
that fellow is about his wife hed
kill them both
  as though drawn by dawns
stare pokes eyes met hers they
were small eyes steely and narrow
slitted and beneath them dawn
dropped hers shuddering to her
plate and she thought of jack
meeting this mans wife secretly
of his kissing her making love to

street  smiths love story magazine
with her hand over the phone dawn whispered a little breathlessly its
phil det he wants to date me do you care if i go id like to
show jack he cant boss me around
forgotten bride

her in hidden places and she wiped
with shaking fingers at her cold lips
  all right to say she hated jack
all right to try and think so but if
anything should happen to him
  a boy shuffling up touched phils
arm a haggard young-old boy
with a gray face and shaking hands
startled dawn raised her eyes and
saw him heard his low pleading
whine and phils guarded not
here you fool cant you see im
not alone with a shock of sick
understanding dawn clutched at
jiis sippvp
  phil thats dopey shaw i
know him hes in my history
class hes a drug fiend oh phil
phil thats what jack meant
thats the scandal youre mixed up
in drug peddling on the campus
how awful
  phils glass crashed to the floor
dont you know any better than to
blurt out a thing like that where
folks can hear mind your own
business and ill take care of mine
then in a sullen whisper you
came to see hilda brian didnt you
well forget me a minute and look
shes over there by the door now
poke brians wife
chapter ii
  in quick answer to phils gaze
dawn swung to see the door beside
which they sat open and through
it came a tall woman with fair pale
hair and huge gray eyes and lips
that seemed to dawn in a sudden
passion of envy the most beautiful
lips in all the world
  and seeing them dawn forgot
about phil forgot about dopey
shaw and his pitiful twisting face
forgot about everything but that
those lips were hilda brians lips
and that jack had kissed them
as though he would ever want to
kiss me again she thought miser-
ably as though any man would
ever want to kiss any one else after
kissing her
  in a stupor of unwilling awe
dawn watched as hilda brian
walked gracefully toward them
watched as she reached their table
and hesitated shivered to her
nearness to the fragrance of her
body she thought wildly shes
going to stop shes going to speak
to me if she does i cant stand it
ill scream
  but she didnt she passed and
reaching pokes side her low-
pitched vibrant tones carried back
to dawns ears
  you wont need me to-night will
you dear ive a headache and id
like to lie down and something
else too something that dawn
couldnt catch it was whispered so
close to pokes bent ear but that
it was about her dawn knew for
she saw pokes eyes shift to where
she sat saw him smile and nod and
then hilda was passing her table
again and looking directly at her
a straight unswerving gaze that in
spite of everything dawn could do
drew and held her own
  dawn felt her flesh tingling felt
her heart a choke in her throat
beautiful eyes-eyes like a cool
gray sea enveloped her beautiful
lips-gentle softly-curving lips
smiled at her such a wistful ghost
of a smile a smile that pulled at
dawns very soul
  a little wildly dawn thought
its as though she were asking me
to like her and she clung to the
hate in her heart with frantic hands
but it was so hard to hate a woman
with a smile like that so terribly
hard
  dawn felt a strange sick sense of
release when she disappeared
through the door once more and

street  smiths love story magazine
turning to find poke brian at their
table his fingers on phils shoulder
she listened in dull uncomprehen-
sion to his blunt short-spoken words
hardly realized at first that he was
speaking of her
  this girls name is arden isnt
it barnes dawn arden you are
to get her out of here and keep her
out why missuss orders she
doesnt like young kids like her
coming here and
then he said some-
thing else in a
hoarse whisper close
against phils ear
something about a
raid -got wind
of it just now bet-
ter get along im
chasing all the col-
lege gang and
his broad shoulders
were swinging down
the room stopping
here stopping there
whispering to this
one touching that
one
  alone phil was
grinning down at
dawn in reckless
impudent white-toothed mocking
  so what he said you heard
orders from the missus im to get
you out and see that you stay out
know where that came from dont
you and whos behind that
  sure dawn said and her eyes
were bitter jack hes seen
hilda brian since this afternoon
hes told her not to let me come
here any more hes afraid ill say
something to her maybe or she to
me but ill show him
  she held out her arms her cheeks
crimson with defiance lets
dance she said if they get me
out of here to-night theyll throw
me out
  phil laughed but shook his head
theres a raid due he said
poke just warned me were
scramming one thing i cant stand
just now-any kind of fuss with the
police
  come along gal were beating
it now
  they had just risen to their feet
dawn straining obstinately against
phils compelling hands when the
cry came a boys
high and shrill as a
girls with fright
the cops
scram
  before the last
word had left his
lips the lights
were out cling-
ing to phils arm
struggling in the
murky darkness
dawn felt a strong
hand pulling at
her and close
against her al-
most in her ear
she heard poke
brians husky
whisper
 that you
barnes-you and the arden kid
youre to get her in the house part
-quick here im holding the
door for you in you go its steel
see and theres a lock when its
safe ill let you out in with you
now
  and then the door was closing
behind them a soft perfumed dark-
ness was enveloping them and
dawn found herself pounding with
futile fists against a thick paneled
wall
  have a heart phil cautioned
be still cant you if you dont
know a lucky break when you get
it i do didnt i tell you i couldnt
afford any tie-up with the cops now
ls-a
forgotten bride

  you heard poke were doing
what he says were waiting here
until he lets us out if we wait all
night
 how long dawn stood there
sobbing pounding she couldnt
have told seconds probably to
her it seemed an eternity but as
her eyes grew accustomed to the
soft darkness and saw there the
comforting security of everyday
things-chairs tables book-lined
walls-her panic left her and some-
thing almost like curiosity took its
place this was her room-hilda
brians room the rugs she walked
on the books she read
  might as well be comfortable
phil said and found an easy chair
he even lit a cigarette and in the
glare of the match dawn saw his
face pale and tense but bright-eyed
with excitement
  across from her on the far side
of the softly-carpeted room a nook
of deep set windows gave out on a
terraced garden they were open
for dawn saw dimly the stirring
curtains and felt the cool night wind
on her hot cheeks
  making her way toward them
dawn leaned against the wide sill
the moon hung its golden lantern
from a star-dotted sky a cricket
chirped on the window ledge
almost beneath her hand yellow
chrysanthemums in a huge blue
bowl sent their spicy fragrance
through the room she pushed
them aside and leaned her hand
still resting against the heavy vase
to stare out
  beyond the tree line where the
highway ran a white ribbon in the
darkness cars were honking on
the other side of the rooms thick
walls came shouts and cries and
muffled laughter but in the little
shrub-enclosed yard below her eyes
ls-a
the beauty and the stillness caught
at dawns breath like a sob
  in the magic of the low-riding
moon the lawn had become a
shimmering golden sea with a tiny
vine-covered porch awning gay
jutting out into it like a ship a
ship in full sail dawn thought
and she pictured herself on it with
jack sailing out into that golden
sea away from all this trouble and
sorrow and shame
  she was still staring at it blinking
back the lonely heartsick tears that
filled her eyes when she saw the
white flutter of a womans dress a
woman who while dawn watched
her walked slowly down the steps
and out into the moon-sprayed
night that she was hilda brian
dawn knew would have known it
she thought had the night been
black as pitch because of the creep-
ing chills that shook her
  there was a man with her too
from where dawn leaned she could
see his tall dark-clothed form and
the white blur that was his face
and she thought with a scornful
twisted lip how cheap she is
meeting her lovers here at her
home under her husbands very
eyes lying to him telling him she
had a headache and then sneaking
out to meet a man
  if jack could see her now she
thought if jack could only see
her
  a walk of mossy flags skirted the
yard and passing under the window
where dawn leaned led to an out-
side gate watching dawn saw
them leave the shadow of the porch
and start down its narrow length
toward her and suddenly her heart
choked her and the blood pounded
against her temples for the mans
face wasnt a blur any more it was
a dark-eyed thin-cheeked familiar
face jacks face and dawn was
so
street  smiths love story magazine
in awe dawn watched hilda brian a tall woman with fair hair huge
gray eyes and lips that seemed to dawn the most beautiful in the world
lips that jack had kissed as though he would ever want to kiss me
again after kissing her she thought miserably
leaning against the sill hidden in	hell see me she tried to move
the shadow of the fluttering cur-	and couldnt her feet were lead-
tains sick and faint and weak	tons of lead weighing her down
  she thought if he looks up	her body was like a frozen body it
forgotten bride

was so cold and white and still if
she could only move away from that
window
  they were talking and their
voices drifted up to her muffled and
soft in the thick soft night there
was a laugh-hildas laugh-
huskily caressing and a tender
darling i hate to let you go but
youd better poke will be coming
any minute now and its dangerous
your being here like this and
about the child-
  dawns fists clenched her cheeks
burned she means me she
thought shes talking about me

street  smiths love story magazine
and laughing i can hear the laugh
in her voice
  - about dawn ill see she
doesnt come here again leave
that to me i warned poke to-
night
  and suddenly before dawn could
move or tear herself away those
beautiful white arms had crept up
and were about jacks neck and
those beautiful laughing lips were
whispering against his face
  wont you kiss me jack before
you go wont you tell me you love
me i need it-oh so terribly my
very very dear
  and dawn had her hands before
her eyes and was praying make
me blind god make me blind and
deaf
  it was phil calling her name that
brought her about in stunned sur-
prise she had forgotten he existed
had forgotten that he was in the
same room or the same world
  dawn he was crying as he hur-
ried toward her whats the mat-
ter what are you seeing out there
in the garden ghosts but halt-
ing beside her his eyes followed
hers and his breath became an in-
drawn whistle whew hilda
brian and jack laird and theres
poke now-hes opening the door
hes coming in hes right behind
us if he catches them down there
-those two-hell kill them both
and then poke was behind
dawn his breath hot on her cheek
and caught by the tenseness that
held both dawn and phil poke was
whispering too whats wrong
with you kids whats going on
out there move over-let me see
dawn had no time to think no
time to analyze the emotions that
prompted her primitive facts beat
against a mind suddenly as primitive
as a childs
    down there in the moonlight be-
 low the window where she stood
 was jack his arms about hilda
 her lips against his in a second
 unless she did something poke
  brian hildas husband would see
 him there and kill him kill jack
 and with a frightened sob and a
 wild crazy sweep of her arm dawn
 grabbed the first thing her fright-
 ened fingers could touch-the huge
 blue bowl with its heavy freight of
 flowers and water and sent it
 careening madly toward the floor
 and pokes feet
   to those two people below that
 opened window the crash coming
 against the sudden silence as it did
 must have sounded like the crack
 of doom
   dazedly dawn was conscious of
 them conscious of jacks white
 upturned face and of his startled
 distended eyes swifty almost as
 the click of a camera lens their
 gaze met and held then poke the
 window and what lay beyond it
 forgotten was nursing an aching
 ankle and swearing softly to him-
 self and phil had his fingers on her
 arm and was dragging her toward
 the door while across an empty
 dance hall where hurrying waiters
 cleaned and righted and sorted lay
 the night and phils waiting car
   they were on their way back to
 town before so it seemed to dawn
 she had begun once more to
 breathe
   phils hands were trembling on
 the wtheel his lips were trembling
 he was laughing beneath his breath
 hysterical almost as a woman
   you certainly wrecked old
 poke he said knocking those
 flowers on him theway you did
 but if you hadnt gosh it would
 have meant murder sure as im
 living a double murder
forgotten bride

  dawn began to cry harsh jerky
sobs she felt like a rag wrung dry
-miserable forlorn she wanted
to die i hate jack laird she
choked i hate him
  phil patted her shoulder in
awkward comforting youre a
square-shooter he said i dont
blame you for hating him but you
sure saved his life and hers
  and he added in awed admira-
tion the nerve of laird kissing
pokes wife under old pokes very
windows sure wish i had his
nerve heaven knows im going to
need it
  he drove for a while in silence
his eyes on the road before him his
lips sober at last he said dawn
you know all right that im in a
mess and i think you know by this
time what it is or guess its
drugs and looking down at her
pinched white face he said pity-
ingly
 heaven knows youve got
troubles enough of your own you
poor kid but maybe listening to
mine will help you forget them
ive got to tell some one or burst
  it was that dopey kid you saw
to-night who got me started you
see he comes from the same town
i do ive known him all my life
my folks knew his mother before
him kind of a relative of ours in
a way she took dope before he
was born theyd no business send-
ing him away to a school like this
he-he came to me here crazy for
the stuff-mad for it got down on
his knees and begged me to get him
some i did i knew a guy in town
who peddled it and i got it for him
  oh im not trying to excuse my-
self dawn i know its a rotten
racket i know theres no excuse
but the guy who sold the stuff to me
was crazy to get into the college
trade and i-i was crazy for
  money money to make myself a
big shot for det he gave me the
money and i delivered the goods
peddling dope- well im tell-
ing you gal its a darned sight
easier game to get into than it is to
get out of take it from me
  dawn touched his hand with hers
she said im sorry phil i-i
cant tell you how sorry i am and
then she forgot him for her own
trouble was too great and too near
  jack and poke brians wife
jack and poke brians wife the
words were a hum in her ears a
drone to the drone of the engine
  at the curb before the house at
last phil stopped he said well
here we are at the sound of his
voice and the harsh rasp of his
brakes two people kissing in the
shadow of the veranda steps broke
apart the girl swung toward them
the door light white on her face it
was det seeing phil her face
tightened for an instant set in stern
young lines but only for an in-
stant then with a taunting laugh
she waved at him and ran through
the door
  phils mouth twisted into a
grotesque mockery of an answering
smile he tried to speak and
groaned shaken out of her grief
dawn stared up at him shocked at
the lost misery of his eyes
  lie put his arm about her im
a rotter im a no-good i deserve
what dets handing me but it hurts
i-i wish youd kiss me good night
dawn im so unhappy
  dawn said im unhappy too
phil and lifted her face to his and
they kissed seeking comfort from
each other sharing each others
misery
  then dawn climbed wearily out
so long phil and phil an-
swered ill be seeing you and
stepped on tlie gas

street  smiths love story magazine
i wish i had let poke brian find you cried dawn do you know that
he was right behind me while you were kissing his wife do you know
that if i hadnt saved you he would have seen you there and killed
you both
  dawn was halfway up the steps hidden by a clump of bushes be-
leading to her sorority house when side the balcony rail he had been
she saw jack	waiting for her and stepping out
forgotten bride

tield his hands up to her in a quick
humbleness of pleading
 dawn he cried darling
to-night at the dells-you saw me
i know i heard a crash and looked
up and there you were staring
down at me from that open window
i hurried right here to explain ive
been waiting-it seems to me hours
i saw you out there in the car kiss-
ing phil barnes oh dawn dear
dont misjudge me give me a
chance theres something ive got
to tell you but i cant tell you to-
night i-i cant i promised to-
morrow-
  swaying where she stood dawn
looked down at him and her face
was frozen and white and cold
not to-morrow nor a thousand to-
morrow she said there isnt
time enough in this world nor the
next to explain away what i saw
and heard this night
  then in a flaming rush of anger
red anger that blurred her sight and
shook her speech
  i wish i hadnt knocked that jar
off onto poke brians feet i wish
to be cc
id let him find you do you know
that he was right behind me while
you were down there beneath that
window kissing his wife do you
know that if i hadnt saved you he
would have seen you there and
killed you both
  she ran up the steps at the top
one she stopped to fling back over
her shoulder
  this is good-by i never want
to see you or hear your voice again
as long as i live
 to drown his answer she
slammed the heavy door behind her
but it stuck and she wasnt soon
enough as she pounded her way
up the thick-carpeted stairs as she
clicked through the hallways and
rattled at the door of her room his
words were ringing in her ears and
timing their threat to the throbbing
of her pulses and to the angry
tumult of her heart
  whether you want to or not he
had cried after her youre going to
see me and youre going to listen
to me too dawn arden if i have
to kidnap you to make you

fires of love
                       by patricia ellsworth
gloria slid her small trim foot
into the second of the scarlet
moccasins the old squaw had
brought in that morning and stood
up to inspect herself in the mirror
a mischievous smile dimpled about
her cupids-bow mouth her warm
brown eyes danced
she was thinking of the tall red-
haired young fellow with whom for
the past two weeks she had been
playing the old old game of love
but in a new fashion gloria knew
that red mckenzie was inter-
ested-he couldnt help being men
up here in this north country were
no different than they were on park
avenue that is they were no dif-
ferent in respect to falling in love
with gloria the only thing was
fires of love

that this broad-shouldered steady-
eyed young alaskan had the power
of hiding behind a mask of appar-
ent indifference whatever he might
be feeling
  her smile faded to a look of
pensive reflection gloria was won-
dering what kirk ralston would
say if he could see her now his
cynical eyes would go slowly over
her outfit-the scarlet fur-lined
moccasins with heavy wool trousers
tucked into their tops the red-and-
black plaid shirt open at the throat
to reveal a v-shaped section of
smooth white skin-and after a lei-
surely survey hed certainly nod his
approval
  ripping winter sports costume
glory old thing she could hear
him drawl
  and after all it was important
what kirk would think because in
the end-no matter how many
hearts she might break in this coun-
try of black silent forests fierce
rushing blue rivers and raw virgin
gold-it was kirk whom she would
marry that had been tacitly set-
tled ever since gloria left finishing
school
  but the tall slender girl in the
colorful costume had no intention of
letting thoughts of kirk hamper her
red mckenzie had so far baffled
her most expert attempts at heart-
breaking he might be interested
but he refused to show it
  wait till he sees me to-night
she thought and suddenly became
aware of the rush and roar of the
storm wind outside her window
inside the road house where her fa-
ther had left her while he made a
flying trip to one of his mines it was
warm and cozy but out there
where night was beginning to add its
terrors to the tumultuous drive of
the blizzard men were pitifully out-
classed
  gloria raised a beautifully mani-
cured hand to her wavy brown hair
she patted it into place turned her
head with the proud motion of a
thoroughbred and again smiled at
the girl in the looking-glass
  youre a rascal she said in a
low thrilling voice and to-night
as usual youre up to rascality
  she turned and went swiftly into
the hall down wide stairs-each
tread made of a single hewn log-
and into the big room where sus-
pended kerosene lamps gave out a
cheerful orange light at the farther
end of the long apartment a great
log fire roared and crackled up the
chimney near the center of the
room stood a large klondike stove
which really furnished the grateful
warmth on nights like this
  the room was deserted save for
a solitary figure standing with its
back to the stove gloria coming
down the last four steps was acutely
aware of the steady scrutiny of those
enigmatic gray eyes she knew that
her entrance was enough to set any
mans heart to beating fast
  then her own heart did a quick
little bound and began to race red
mckenzie was coming toward her
not only that but the mask was
gone from his handsome masterful
face and his eyes burned with an
expression she had never seen in
them before
  gloria he cried
  just that one word but gloria
suddenly knew that neither kirk
ralston nor any of the other men
with whom she played around back
in new york could have said as
much in five minutes she stood
on the bottom step her dusky-red
lips parted her cheeks flushed her
eyes sparkling
  suddenly and amazingly she felt
the wild impulse to turn and run
there was something in that deeply

street  smiths love story magazine
tanned resolute face that frightened
her
  i wonder if you know how beau-
tiful you are he said in a low vi-
brant voice gloria its no use
pretending this is a country where
men speak the truth and you-
  glorias feet seemed frozen to that
bottom step a tiny voice within
her cried fly fly youve
started something you cant con-
trol
  then she was in his arms her
face was against his and gloria
found herself marveling at the sat-
iny softness of his skin he held
her close in arms of steel
  gloria my darling he whis-
pered huskily ive tried to fight
against you-youre the only thing
in the world ive ever feared love
-it can be so terrible but its no
  gloria had recovered the use of
her lithe young muscles with a
sudden twist she freed herself she
stood facing him breathing deeply
she knew that her eyes were still
dancing that her face was flushed
  but that was just the mechanical
reaction to being kissed by a man
as handsome and strong as red mc-
kenzie it had been an interesting
experience however this confla-
gration she had started must be
quickly quenched
  im so sorry she said almost in
a whisper red-mr mckenzie
if ive led you to think-if youve
misconstrued-
  he was looking at her with an
expression that made her falter
there was amazement in it and
something else
  gloria knew that now her face
was blazing for an instant she
dropped her eyes before that ac-
cusing stare
  then she forced herself to look
squarely at him
  i thought youd remember our
comparative circumstances she
breathed
  red frowned he stirred as if
he were going to take her in his
arms again then he laughed a
low scornful laugh
 you mean that you are the
daughter of a wealthy man that
youre listed in the social register
he asked softly
  gloria tried to think of some
other way of putting it somehow
red managed to make the reason
back of her conduct so sordid and
ugly
  then she nodded
  ind youve just been playing
with me he demanded
  gloria wished she had never come
down those wide stairs she wished
shed never come to this north
country almost for the moment
she wished that shed never been
born
  miserably she nodded again
  oh red im so sorry i didnt
think-
  you didnt think i could feel
pain you thought a man like me
-a rough common person with no
background-was just something to
be played with and broken and
tossed aside his voice was as cold
as the storm wind raging outside
i see well i can take it and
perhaps learn a useful lesson by the
experience
 he turned and went striding
across the long mellowly lighted
room and out through a door that
opened into the kitchen wing
 gloria stood without moving
her lips were parted her eyes were
wide and frightened
  another door over at the farther
side opened and a man came
through he was not as tall as red
but he had enormous shoulders and
arms so long and powerful that they
fires of love

made him look like some dangerous
animal his eyes were keen and
narrow he looked about as if to
assure himself that there was no one
in the big room except the radiantly
beautiful girl at the foot of the
stairs
when he came across
those cruel shining
eyes burned into hers
ah miss gloria
he murmured you
are beau-tee-ful to-
night always you are
beau-tee-ful but now-
see i kneel before
you
gloria drew back
there was something
about jacques lacleve
her fathers manager up
here in alaska that
made her flesh creep
im afraid i must
leave you she mur-
mured making a move
to start up the stairs
  lacleve was up from his kneeling
position with incredible speed and
precision he glided before her bar-
ring her way standing so close
that she could see the little flecks
of scaly color in his black eyes he
was again smiling that evil smile
you didnt think
i could feel pain
you thought a
man like me-a
rough common
person with no
background-was
just something to
be played with
and broken and
tossed aside he
gave a scornful
laugh

street  smiths love story magazine
  this is alaska he said ab-
ruptly in this country men and
women show their true natures my
beau-tee-ful darling-
  he swept her up in those long
powerful arms gloria twisted side-
wise and her white pearly teeth
sank into the flesh of his shoulder
  with a snarling cry of pain he
dropped her she sprang quickly
away
  jacques lacleve rubbed the place
where gloria had bitten him a
slow smile spread over his dark
menacing face
  little wild cat he murmured
but i like you so my darling and
what jacques lacleve likes-he
takes
  he made no move to come closer
gloria watched him with abhor-
rence
  as soon as my father returns
- she began
  lacleve shrugged
  when he returns i shall be away
on business you will tell him what
i have done you will have me
discharged my beau-tee-ful dar-
ling i have not been idle during
these eight years i work for your
father i have feathered my nest
i am reech i discharge myself
  he paused and his burning eyes
went slowly and gloatingly over the
slender graceful figure of the girl
who with flashing eyes and dilated
nostrils confronted him
  but i shall come back he mur-
mured at a time when you do
not expect me-i shall come back
he gave her a long meaning look
  then he was gone gloria drew
out her handkerchief and viciously
scrubbed the spot on her cheek
where he had kissed her
  the wind was rising she moved
across toward the big round stove
in the center of the room then
abruptly she paused and stood in-
tently listening
  distant bells and the fierce ex-
ultant yelp of malemute dogs rac-
ing for the shelter of the road house
  the door leading into the kitchen
swung open and she saw the vast
figure of jake thompson proprietor
of the establishment usually his
round plump face was wreathed in
smiles but to-night he looked grave
and uneasy
  what is it jake gloria de-
manded
  a man just came through from
the mines miss he told her
theres word from your father
suddenly gloria was trembling
she took an impulsive step toward
the man
 what is it she demanded
sharply tell me quickly dont
just stand there
jake thompson rubbed his chin
miss he rumbled if you was
to take something a drop of brandy
to kind of brace you up-
  she darted across to where he
stood seized his shoulders and tried
to shake him
  tell me whats happened she
cried is dad sick
  he got hurt miss but theres
a good doctor up there and most
likely hell be all right he was un-
conscious
  gloria wasnt frightened now
that the full force of the calamity
had struck her she was steady and
resolute
  ill start for the mines at once
she said steadily please arrange
everything
but jake was shaking his head
you cant possibly get up there
till this storms over he protested
in two or three days maybe
gloria stamped her foot the
fires of love

fur-lined moccasin made a thudding
sound as it struck the log floor
  do as i tell you she cried im-
periously dad needs me he may
be dying there must be some one
who-
  jake backed farther into the open
doorway he turned and looked
into the kitchen then he faced
gloria and drew the door partly
shut
  this musher who came down was
nearly trapped by the storm miss
he explained in a low voice but
theres one man could make it ill
talk to him
  gloria knew she had heard of
red mckenzies prowess as a storm
fighter and she knew reds male-
mutes he had given her lessons in
driving them for an instant her
mind fought against the idea of
asking a favor of a man who had
talked to her as red had then
she thought of her father uncon-
scious perhaps dying
  please tell mr mckenzie to be
ready as quickly as he can and
tell him this is strictly business ill
pay him whatever he asks
  a heavy fur cap that completely
hid her shining brown hair a parka
fur-lined and warm as eiderdown
mittens gloria was so wrapped
away from the storm that she
moved with difficulty out through
the kitchen where jake thompson
stood shaking his head and fearing
the worst out through a door that
was quickly opened and as quickly
closed in that instant the bliz-
zard struck her so roughly in the
face that she gasped and turned her
head
  before she could turn back strong
arms swung her from her feet and
were carrying her she felt as
helpless as a baby dimly through
the driving snow she saw the stern
impassive face above hers again
her heart was pounding like a wild
thing
  red she murmured its so
good of you-
  this is strictly business as far
as im concerned miss red mc-
kenzie broke in
  he stooped and lowered her into
the inclosed portion of the long sled
out in front their sharp ears tilted
forward she could see the dogs
  a long-lashed whip whistled and
cracked with the resonance of a
pistol shot
  mush you rascals red cried
  the sled was flying away from
the road house into the storm red
ran behind the dogs yelped shrilly
and silvery bells attached to their
collars tinkled against the wind
  the yellow lights in the windows
of the log building were gone on
every side was the raging storm
gloria nestled down into the warm
space red had placed her in he
had tucked heavy blankets about
her
  she turned her head
  cant you ride she called
 no answer the dogs were
stretched out racing fleetly away
into the night red mckenzie ran
like a panther behind the long sled
suddenly gloria felt how small and
helpless she was
  if hed only be friends she
thought then felt her face burning
again
  she hadnt been very friendly
she had deliberately flirted till she
caught his interest she had set
herself to break through the barrier
of reserve he had erected then
she had pleaded the social register
 the dogs had settled down to
their nights work for a time they
went briskly up a long grade then

street  smiths love story magazine
they topped the summit and gloria
saw the tall figure of her compan-
ion balancing on the rear of the
sled
  impulsively she spoke
 red-mr mckenzie i wish
youd tell me more about your dogs
they seem so faithful and strong
  yes miss theyre good dogs
  gloria bit her lip he certainly
knew how to keep her at a distance
she cowered down into the sled and
realized how lonely she was out
here in this untamed northland-
at night in a storm that had sent
experienced mushers running for
cover
  timidly she looked up at him
  red if id been born up here
if i were used to this wild country
and-
  the sled struck the bottom of the
grade and red was again running
behind
  hi tillicum hi juno he
cried mush
 gloria bowed her head she
squeezed her eyes tight shut but
hot salty tears were stealing down
her face they froze there and she
began to sob
  abruptly red was again stand-
ing on the rear platform
  feet cold he inquired and ms
voice certainly was
  no im warm as toast but
red-
  abrupt and eerie there came the
sound of a long-drawn shout gloria
caught her breath and listened
  the eerie voice came again
  ahoy mckenzie pull up
  red mckenzie ignored the sum-
mons
  mush you rascals he cried
  another sound-the crack of a
rifle shot the whine of a high-pow-
ered bullet gloria cried out in
terror
  steady give me that carbine
red ordered
  she groped for it and a second
cracking shot ripped through the
howl of the wind
  a dog yelped shrilly the team
whirled and in an instant they were
milling and fighting red leaped
among them gloria could see him
cutting straps hurling something
out of the track of the sled
  oh red she cried piteously
one of your dogs-
  never mind that he snarled
back at her steady you rascals
tillicum-gee there you are
  he came swinging back and for
an instant stood staring toward the
back trail
  hes trying to snipe us miss
he muttered its lucky i gave you
some lessons in driving a dog team
you may have to use it
  glorias heart was beating slowly
heavily a great weight of fear
crushed down upon her
 you mean-
  but they were flying over the
trail and red was running at her
side he had thrust the carbine
back into her mittened hands
looking fearfully upward she mar-
veled at the easy endurance with
which he kept up with the flying
malemutes
  a third crashing shot-and red
mckenzie stumbled and nearly fell
he caught at the crossbar of the
sled the dogs sensing something
wrong slowed to a trot and stopped
  gloria tried to scramble out an
unsteady hand pressed her back
  got me-through the shoulder
red muttered listen miss you
can drive the dogs know the trail
he swayed drunkenly next in-
stant he had fallen heavily to the
snow he lay very still gloria
facing the crisis of her young life
took her courage in both hands
fires of love

  quickly she stooped and grasped
reds shoulders how heavy he
was gloria had never tried to lift
a man before
  she clenched her teeth
  ive got to she whispered
red darling
  there was a crimson stain seep-
ing out into the snow the sight
of it released an almost superhuman
power in her slender body quickly
she slid her arms under him and
staggered erect
  a snarling shout from behind
and gloria had lifted red into the
sled she caught up the carbine
whirled and fired into the darkness
then the gun was back lying across
reds body
  glorias clear eager voice rang
out
 mush-tillicum-juno mush
you rascals
  there was a sob at the end of
that thrilling command she was
using the words she had so often
heard red use and now she was
balanced on the rear platform and
the dogs were racing with tense
traces down a long grade
  no more shots but she could
hear the distant yelps of another
dog team she had recognized that
hoarse evil voice jacques lacleve
had taken advantage of her emer-
gency and his team would be pull-
ing a lighter load than reds male-
mutes
  something loomed over at the
side gloria shaded her eyes from
the blinding snow set back from
the narrow trail she could just make
out the gloomy bulk of a cabin
there were no lights in the windows
  gee she cried tillicum
juno
  they were swerving they took
the turn into the narrow gulch al-
most at full speed and dashed up
to the deserted cabin
  red she panted red dar-
ling cant you hear me oh i need
you so
  but there was no sound from the
motionless figure lying in the sled
with flying fingers gloria unfast-
ened the dogs she crossed to the
cabin door and opened it the
malemutes trotted into the dark in-
terior of the building
  with determined chin raised high
she swung back to the sled she
got down on her knees slid her
round young arms under the figure
of the man who had suddenly come
to mean so much to her and next
moment was staggering across to
the open door she laid red on a
bunk in one corner
  a threatening shout roared out
suddenly
  you inside the cabin must i
keel you all
  it was lacleves voice gloria
crouched near the shattered window
the carbine rested across her knees
if she could just see him that evil
head poised on those immense
shoulders
  confusedly she found herself
wondering at the strange fierce
strength that steadied her nerves
and quickened her muscles was
this the gloria carver who had
played tennis at palm beach and
newport was this the careless
pleasure-loving young thing who
had been going to marry kirk ral-
ston because he was the most de-
sirable man in her set
  no sound save the mighty voice
of the blizzard gloria shivered
  suddenly gloria tensed some-
thing was stirring back there
  the dogs yelped and snarled a
gun flamed and one of the male-
mutes lay kicking

street  smiths love story magazine
 gloria swung the
carbine but the gun
was knocked from her
clutching hands a
dark muffled figure
was upon her it
caught her in gigantic
arms and whirled her
from her feet
 now jacques la-
cleve was kissing her
his face was crusted with frozen
snow he rubbed that icy cheek
against hers then again his burning
lips were seeking her eyes her
throat her lips
 red red
 but it was not red mckenzie
who came driving upon them a
huge black dog snarled once and
launched himself like
an arrow for lacleves
throat
drag him down
tillicum gloria
cried
laclave evidently
had figured that that
one shot was enough
to cow the malemutes
now the lead dog had
hurled him to the ground
  gloria panting and shaken had
torn herself free from his arms as he
went down
red she cried red darling
then back there in the darkness
tillicum was snarling and worrying
something gloria saw that lacleve
was lying very still and that the
ls-a
red she panted red
darling cant you hear
me oh i need you so
but there was no sound
from the motionless fig-
ure lying in the sled
fires of love

great black dog was merely menac-
ing his vanquished foe
  she raced across to the bunk
where red lay and began to work
furiously once red opened his
eyes and tried to mutter a protest
  leave me you-the dogs-
  but he lay still and silent when
she lifted him into the sled
  then they were again flying
through the storm red had said
that his dogs knew the trail to the
mine gloria alternately running
behind and balancing on the tiny
platform tried to realize that
this was not just a terrible
dream it was reality some-
where in that whirling dark-
ness ahead her father lay
perhaps dying
  but the thing that brought
a sob to her trembling lips
was the glint of that white
still face almost at her feet
  red red she whispered
unsteadily i do love you
why didnt i know it in
time
  the roar of the blizzard
and occasionally the sharp
yelp of one of the malemutes
on and on till gloria believed time
had ceased and eternity had begun
  nothing but black swaying trees
and then-
  mush tillicum mush juno
mush you rascals there are the
lights gloria cried
  she sat in a warm tastefully fur-
nished room in doctor tollivers log
house the tall ruddy-faced mine
physician was bending over the bed
  he turned and looked wonder-
ingly at gloria
  gloria lass i dont see how ye
did it redll weigh one hundred
and eighty if he weighs a pound
ye must have muscles of steel un-
der that soft warm flesh
 ls-a
  gloria shook her head impa-
tiently
  never mind me she whispered
huskily is he-is red-
  its only the good that die
young my dear doctor tolliver
said mischievously hell be con-
scious any time now
  gloria stood up her face was
radiant
  and dads coming along all
right she asked
  hes doing as well as ye can ex-
pect itll be a good four weeks be-
fore he gets the use of his legs
  gloria stood looking down at the
man in the bed her face had in it
a light that made the old scotch
doctor shake his head and smile a
bit wistfully
  do ye really love him doctor
tolliver asked in a voice that was
almost a whisper
  love red i love him so that
im going to stay up in this terrible
country just to be with him al-
ways
  the old doctor carefully removed
his glasses and wiped them
  then ill let ye into a bit of a
secret he said the young rascal
came up here five years ago from
the states the next year up comes

street  smiths love story magazine
a fine gentleman in fifth avenue
raiment looking for his son no one
by the name he wanted anywhere
hereabout but when he set eyes
on red mckenzie-
  abruptly the shock of red hair
outlined against the snowy pillow
stirred red twisted his head and
stared belligerently up
 shut up doc he rasped
thats my secret
  doctor tolliver chuckled
  ill teach ye to play possum on
me and ill leave ye to whisper
your own secrets remember nurse
ye mustnt excite him
  gloria sat on the edge of the bed
her eyes were wide and wondering
  whatever did doctor tolliver
mean she demanded
  red grinned he pulled her down
beside him tumbled her hair
rubbed that smooth velvety cheek
of his against her flushed one
  then he took her face between his
strong hands and looked deep into
her eye
  years ago he explained there
was a family of nice people who had
an apartment overlooking central
park and a summer home up in
westchester they were the kind
of people who keep their servants
till theyre old and then pension
them salt-of-the-earth people
  all except one member he was
red-headed and at the time i am
telling you about he had freckles
he was the kind of boy who wants
to know what is going on in those
far places where the jungle crouches
warm and steamy in the tropic sun
or up where men of iron pit their
strength against the great white si-
lence then one day this boy mis-
understood something his father did
it was done for his good but he
didnt see it that way remember
he had red hair and a temper which
up to that time had never been dis-
ciplined
  so he did what many other fool-
ish young fellows do he ran away
he came up here to alaska and
every one called him red before
long he regretted what he had done
but he was too proud to admit that
to any one however he wrote a
confidential letter to a friend and
six weeks later the finest most up-
right and kindly gentleman in all
the world made the long trip by
train and steamer and for five hun-
dred miles by dog sled just to tell
him that every one at home loved
him they loved him so much that
they wanted him to live his own life
in his own way all they asked was
an occasional letter telling them
that he was well and happy
  red laughed a deep vibrant
laugh that made something in glo-
rias heart begin to dance
  he had been a spoiled boy back
in the old days but the northland
taught him that real strength is gen-
tle never boisterous or self-asser-
tive red told her perhaps it
made a man of him
  gloria struggled to her elbow
her arm went under his neck and
she bent over him staring into his
laughing gray eyes
  and then another spoiled young
thing came up here and the man
they call red learned to love her
she said tremulously
  but red didnt try to answer that
in words what use did gloria have
for words when red was crushing
her close as though he would never
let her go when his lips were pressed
to hers in a throbbing kiss that
thrilled her to the depths of her
soul with a sigh of content she
relaxed in his arms secure in the
knowledge that nothing could ever
extinguish the fires of love that
burned so brightly in their hearts
tender arms
                          by elise phillips
tired ward asked as they
followed louisa and phil
from the ear into the lobby
of the piny woods manor
  tm tired and cold and hungry
jocelyn replied and im cross
wards voice was heavy with sar-
casm as he said you amaze me
oh dont be funny jocelyn
dropped into a big armchair her
coat collar turned up to her ears
her brown vagabond hat drawn
down almost to the bridge of her
slim small nose your wit is
about as light as an elephants foot
she surveyed the people sitting
and walking about the brilliantly
lighted lobby and wondered why
she had allowed herself to be per-
suaded to take this trip she hadnt
wanted to leave new york she
had been enjoying the parties all

street  smiths love story magazine
their ffnds had been giving since
she and ward announced their en-
gagement but he and phil had got-
ten the idea that a couple of weeks
in pinehurst would be fun
  and whatever phil thinks
louisa agrees to jocelyn told her-
self shes that kind of wife and
ward expects me to be just like
her
  she turn d to stare at her sister
standing at the desk beside phil
and noticed she was getting heavier
  thats what marriage does to
you jocelyn decided
  suddenly she sat up straight
pushing her hat back with an im-
patient shove
  look she urged ward look
at that man over there
  his gaze followed hers to where a
broad-shouldered young man in a
dinner jacket sat reading a paper
  what about him ward in-
quired with a scowl friend of
yours
  not yet jocelyn replied but
isnt he the best-looking brute you
ever laid your eyes on hes got
features like a movie star and that
sort of eome-to-me-darling look in
his eyes im glad i came to pine-
hurst after all
  youre a flirt ward growled
his hand on her chair knotting into
a tight fist
  jocelyn whirled about to face him
cornflower eyes under her curling
brown bangs narrowed to slits
what do you mean im a flirt
cant i even say a perfectly strange
man is good-looking without your
getting jealous
  im not jealous ward denied
with sulky dignity but i do think
that for a girl who has been en-
gaged only four weeks you give a
lot of time to other men
  at that moment phi and louisa
joined them and jocelyns retort
was cut off in the flow of louisas
complaints about the rooms assigned
them
  they claim they never got our
telegram she said as the four
moved toward the dining room
but thats ridiculous they finally
gave phil and me a room on the
second floor youre up on the third
jocelyn and ward is on the fourth
the clerk says hell try to get us a
suite to-morrow
  they were passing the man with
the newspaper and for a second he
looked up his eyes meeting joce-
lyns briefly deliberately knowing
ward was watching she smiled an
answering smile flashed across the
others face
  jocelyn had been feeling sulky
but now a pleasant exhilaration
lightened her spirits the man was
certainly attractive and just be-
cause she was engaged it didnt
mean that she couldnt even look at
another man
  she became aware of ward stalk-
ing at her side
  are you making yourself con-
spicuous just to annoy me he de-
manded
  her good nature restored jocelyn
laid a placating hand on bis arm
  dont be cross she soothed
youll feel better when youve had
something to eat
  theres no good putting me off
with talk about dinner ward re-
torted and jocelyn looking up into
his face saw it was dark with anger
  her own quick temper flared and
her eyes blazed as she stood still
confronting him at the entrance to
the dining room
  dont be dumb she snapped
im not putting you off with any-
thing are you still grousing be-
cause i happened to say with per-
fect truth that that man out there
is handsome
tender arms

  its not only that man ward
began its-
  dont tell me its the principle
of the thing jocelyn interrupted
when any one says that i know
hes trying to be disagreeable the
truth is youre idiotically jealous
and im not going to stand it
ward surveyed her in silence a
moment his features granite-hard
an uncomfortably hollow sensation
crept over jocelyn a little pulse
of fear started vibrating deep inside
her she thrust out her hand with
an inarticulate cry
  i didnt mean- she began
when louisas voice sharp with im-
patience cut her off
  what are you two waiting for
she demanded come on and lets
have something to eat
  ward stood aside for jocelyn with
the hint of a mocking bow
  when you and your sister have
been fed we can continue this dis-
cussion about what you will and will
not stand
  jocelyn silent and apprehensive
preceded him to the table where
louisa and phil waited
  she sank into a seat and slowly
peeled the gloves from her hands
her eyes were on the big emerald
that glowed on her third finger as
she waited in silence for her order
  when it came she couldnt eat
her throat was tight and a sense
of utter weariness possessed her
occasionally from under her long
lashes she stole a glance at ward
he was talking to phil about golf
  i think ill go to bed she an-
nounced suddenly
  ward turned to her wtait a bit
it will do you good to get a breath
of air before you turn in
  yes do go outside a while
louisa urged
  she thinks you want to kiss me
good night jocelyn observed
better come and get it over with
or shell be disappointed my sis-
ter has a romantic soul
  she led the way from the long
room then stepped out a french
door onto a gallery running the
length of the hotel the autumn air
was crisp and fragrant with pines
jocelyn stood still for a moment
leaning against the rail drawing in
great deep breaths of the bracing
air
  ward stood behind her silent
then unexpectedly his arms came
about her and he pulled her into a
tempestuous embrace his cheek
pressed hard against the girls
  i love you he said his voice
rough with emotion and you con-
tinually make a mockery of it if
you loved me you wouldnt
  jocelyn moved her cheek the least
bit so the roughness of his rubbed
against her tender face his mas-
culinity seemed to engulf her she
felt suddenly suffocated
  she wrenched free from his hold
facing him in the dim light filtering
through the windows
  i do love you she said speak-
ing slowly and thoughtfully but
ive got to be myself i cant be
watched and suspected all the time
love to me means faith trust
unless you can trust me i cant be-
lieve you love me
  i do trust you ward broke in
but you make it so wretchedly
hard you flirt with every man you
see there are times when i think
youd go off with the first one who
asked you
  jocelyn stiffened rigid with shock
so thats what you think of me
she pulled the emerald from her fin-
ger and held it out on the flat of
palm take it she ciied in
spite of herself her voice broke on
a sob
  ward made no move to accept the

street fc smiths love story magazine
ring she let it drop to the floor
and whirled toward the entrance
  wait he begged striding after
her jocelyn i didnt mean-
some one had come along behind
him picked up the ring
  is this yours the newcomer
asked ward and in the moment it
took him to accept it jocelyn was
gone
  in her room she dropped to the
side of her bed beating her clenched
fists against the soft bedclothes
the tears she would not shed
swelled in her throat
  she would take the train back to
new york in the morning she
would get a job as cook scrub-
woman-anything shed
never see ward again
jocelyn shivered feeling
herself exiled already
  she stared about the unfamiliar
room with hostile eyes then
slowly she undressed pulled a
nightgown of palest blue over her
head and tied its sash with a jerk
  she made a little pile on the end
of the dressing table of her diamond-
studded wrist watch her gold com-
pact and her purse ward had
given her the first two she would
leave them at the desk for him with
a note
  jocelyn picked up a sheet of pa-
per but could not find the right
she awoke suddenly to the sure knowledge that some one was in her
room it was a man what are you doing here she demanded trying
but not succeeding in keeping a sharp note of terror from her voice
sides legs stretched out tense and
straight under the covers she re-
viewed their first meeting it had
been at a tennis match last spring
seeing him tall and bronzed in his
white flannels the men about her
had seemed infantile and boring
he was it turned out a classmate
of phils
other men had been exciting she
remembered almost as exciting as
the night coming home from the
theater when he had asked her to
marry him
  she closed her eyes living again
his passionate kisses feeling the
pressure of his arms that lifted her
to breathless heights of exultation
tender arms	
words and pushed it impatiently
aside
she hated ward she told herself
lying in bed hands clenched at her
  it had been easy for them to see
a lot of each other and at first his
wanting to monopolize her his open
resentment of any time she gave to

street  smiths love story magazine
  and now he dared to tell her he
couldnt trust her that she was no
better than a cheap flirt
  jocelyns whole body burned with
the indignity of it she flung off the
blankets sat up in bed taut and
furious then she fell back against
the pillow sobbing
  she didnt know how long she had
slept when she awoke to the sure
knowledge that some one was in her
room swiftly without giving her-
self time to think she jerked on
the bed light then blinking in its
sudden radiance she saw a pair of
black-clad shoulders and the back of
a smooth black head
  what are you doing here she
demanded trying but not quite suc-
ceeding in keeping a sharp note of
terror from her voice
  the intruder turned and she rec-
ognized the man she had seen in the
lobby earlier in the evening he
carried a key and a huge silver flask
his hair was mussed and he swayed
unsteadily
  howd you get in my room he
asked his words coming thick and
slurred
  im not in your room youre in
mine jocelyn snapped her mo-
mentary fear gone in a gust of an-
noyance
  the man shook his head and ad-
vanced toward the bed
  thats kind of compli-com-
pli- you know what i mean
kind of mixed up lets have a
drink and see if it straightens out
  jocelyn waved him away in-
wardly she felt a renewed tremor of
fright suppose he tried to make
love to her suppose- deter-
minedly she forced herself to speak
calmly
  i dont want a drink and youve
had too many already go  get
out of here i want to sleep
 aw whats the hurry my
names conroy whats yours
  he was she saw young and in
spite of his being tight almost un-
believably good-looking a boyish
grin lighted his face now and be-
fore jocelyn realized his intention
he had seated himself comfortably
in the chair beside the bed in spite
of herself she could not feel angry
do have a drink he urged
instead she took his key from him
and studied its number
  this is room  she told him
and your key is for  you be-
long another flight up
  he stared at her apparently lost
in admiration
  clever of you he said id
never have thought of that
  he got to his feet none too stead-
ily and started weaving toward the
door
 on an impulse jocelyn swung
over the side of the bed shoved her
toes into her mules and wrapped
her kimono around her
  id better see that you get to
your room she decided if you
go breaking into places like this
youre apt to get into trouble
  the mans legs seemed to grow
unsteadier as she guided him out
the door and up a flight of stairs
he walked along the hall with an
elaborate caution jocelyn found
amusing
  at the sound of the elevator door
clanging shut she felt his arm
which she had taken to steady him
stiffen under her hold
  its all right she assured him
in the tone one uses to a fretful
child then she in her turn grew
stiff with horror
ward was coming toward them
jocelyns hand dropped from her
companions arm her tongue was
stiff and her mouth dry with an
instinctive gesture she pulled the
tender arms

pale-blue silk of her kimono tighter
about her
  she tried to speak failed then
tried again managing a husky
ward
  if he saw her it was impossible
to guess it head high shoulders
squared he would have passed her
  jocelyn flung herself forward
catching at the sleeve of his coat
with frantic fingers still without
meeting her eyes he attempted to
shake her off but jocelyn hung on
bringing her flushed face close to his
   youve got to listen she panted
it isnt what you think that man
was in my room and-
  thats exactly what i am think-
ing ward cut in his tone bleak
as ice
  hot blood flamed in jocelyns
cheeks her eyes snapped
  you would she cried im
trying to tell you hes tight and got
into my room by mistake i must
have forgotten to lock the door
she drew away from him stand-
ing stiff and straight
  and now that ive explained
she added i never want to see you
again
  she turned suddenly remember-
ing she still held the key to con-
roys room conroy was gone
  there was a sound of running
feet and then conroy came into
view closely followed by a tall
heavy-built man in a gray uniform
seeing ward the pursuer yelled
head him off sir
  ward went into action bringing
conroy down with a flying tackle
and holding him in spite of his de-
termined struggling until the watch-
man came up
  now then the latter said
sternly i guess weve got you with
the goods comisky
  the man whom jocelyn knew as
conroy straightened his lip twisted
in a sneer the last evidence of his
recent intoxication was gone
  youre crazy murphy he
snarled you havent got anything
on me
  well see about that ill just
take a peek in your pockets
conroy grew threatening ill
have the law on you for this mo-
lesting a guest
  shut up murphy ordered he
drew from the mans pocket a wrist
watch a purse and a jeweled com-
pact
  jocelyn staring gave a sharp
gasp why those are mine
understanding came to her and
with it rage
  you thief she cried you
werent tight at all you deliber-
ately got into my room to steal
hysterical laughter shook her her
voice rose to a shrill pitch and
me helping you upstairs feeling
sorry for you-
  a touch on her arm restored her
to self-control
  take it easy miss the watch-
man counseled thats his regular
game but weve never been able to
get the goods on him before can
you identify these things as yours
jocelyn nodded decisively oh
absolutely see theres my mono-
gram on the watch and compact
and my name is in the purse mr
rutledge-she turned to ward for
confirmation-gave them to me
yes i did he acknowledged
without inflection of any sort
  at last murphy and his charge
were gone and jocelyn found herself
in the corridor alone with ward
the quiet seemed intolerable to the
girl she had quarreled with him
before but this flintlike silence was
worse than any words
  she waited a moment longer for
him to speak to make some move
then with an inarticulate murmur

street  smiths love story magazine
she whirled and started along the
corridor and down the stairs toward
her room
  her action seemed to galvanize
the man she could hear his quick
footsteps behind her he was gain-
ing on her pulses throbbing joce-
lyn reached her door at that mo-
ment ward overtook her and
crowded into the room beside her
  startled and strangely appre-
hensive jocelyn turned to him his
hands were clenched at his sides
his face was working with emotion
  jocelyn he burst out dont
hate me
  unexpectedly her legs would no
longer support her and jocelyn sank
inlo the nearest chair instantly
ward was at her feet head against
her knees
  forgive me he pleaded after
you left me i went out and tramped
the woods fighting things out with
myself i was going to beg you to
give me another trial to promise
never to doubt you again then i
came in found you- jocelyn
felt him shudder
  leaning forward she slipped her
arms about his shoulders cradled his
head against her heart
  it did look pretty bad she ad-
mitted softly i dont blame you
for thinking-
  dont ward interrupted i
was a beast i ought to be shot
oh darling i love you so ill never
doubt you again im just going to
love and trust you always
  jocelyns arms tightened their
hold then ward was kissing her
over and over as though he could
never get enough of her lips they
clung together trembling inco-
herent with the exultation that
surged through them like a ruthless
overpowering tide
  you poor baby were you terri-
bly frightened when you found that
man in your room he asked pres-
ently
  jocelyn shook her head
  not scared just mad i wanted
to get him out in a hurry
  she burrowed her cheek into his
shoulder with a little sigh
  i guess it depends on the man
theres one here now and i dont
care if he never goes
  i do well to keep an eye on you
ward teased then his tone deep-
ened became serious some day
- he began
  what do you mean some day
jocelyn broke in her voice warm
and sweet her eyes starry isnt
to-morrow as good a day as any-
for a wedding
       jr
         the gift
 xae gathered rare orchids together
       for the house by the little lagoon
 the beach held the magic of twilight
 that covered the islands too soon
 the waves were like dancers in silver
 that tossed their pale stars in the spray
 but the night wrapped in tropical beauty
 brought us love then stole softly away

jans got to get out ma shes too
pretty if im to grab a rich
husband youve got to give me
a fair chance i cant do a thing
with jan hanging around men
simply fall for her in rows even
yesterday when she was helping
sukey and looked awful all carle-
ton vance could see was jan im
sick of it anyway youve done
enough for her after all shes just
a niece of papas she ought to
have brains enough to get out and
support herself
  but what would she do was
aunt millies plaintive whine
  i dont care lutie snapped i
just know shes going or i am and
if i go youll be sorry she finished
meaningly
  lutie aunt millie cried in
horror

street  smiths love story magazine
  janine didnt wait to hear any
more but slid out of the swing and
through the moonflowers down the
back way to anne derrys and as
she went her anger grew until it
shook her body with fury
  janine was quite sure that lutie
her cousin had known she was in
the swing for another thing
lutie knew that her cousin janine
had given aunt millie ten years of
her life so that lutie could stay in
an expensive french school of late
janine had worked harder than old
black sukey who was growing too
feeble to do much trust lutie not
to lift a finger although she well
knew that her mothers modest in-
come could not keep a higher-priced
servant and pay luties school bills
at the same time
  janine reflected that this was the
thanks she received lutie had been
home less than a month and janine
must get out janines smile was a
trifle grim lutie was far from
beautiful but she knew how to wear
clothes and she had a keen mind
and a quick tongue no one had
been more surprised than janine
when carleton vance had devoted
himself to her rather than to lutie
  janine her tousled coppery hair
tied with an old blue bandanna of
aunt sukeys an outgrown blue
gingham showing the slim roundness
of her figure and floury arms busy
with beaten biscuit had still claimed
the rich gay young mans attention
janine couldnt blame lutie for be-
ing peeved about it but she did
blame her for acting so unsporting
  all this janine poured out to
anne her friend as she flung herself
down under the big lawn umbrella
  im getting out as fast as i can
janine ended sullenly biting her
quivering lip viciously i dont
know what ill do miss days
school didnt fit me for much useful
work and aunt millie always said
it didnt matter i was to have a
home with her until i went to one
of my own
 you cant leave jan youd
never be able to get a decent job
why the margaret home is simply
overflowing anne said gravely
mrs babbie called me only yester-
day to ask me to get the league
together and see if we couldnt man-
age larger quarters for the girls her
assistant is so overworked shes
leaving her flat
  jan straightened anne right
there is a job and you werent go-
ing to tell me about it
  anne laughed youd never do
your aunt wouldnt even let you
help us down there let alone going
there to live you dont know swan-
town in summer its the tenement
district poverty criminals in hid-
ing what do you know about such
things and what do you know
about working in a place like the
margaret home
  well i can learn id scrub
floors janine declared passion-
ately before id stay another week
under the same roof with lutie
but jan dont rush into it like
this come north with me and
maybe by fall lutie will be married
and you can go back
 thanks no anne you know
i havent any money and i wouldnt
go as your guest if mrs babbie
will have me im going to work
can we go to sec her now
 anne derry looked at janine
thoughtfully she knew this mood
of jans knew the sultry fires in
the girls passionate violet eyes the
fury twisting the beautiful mouth
jan was equal to doing anything if
she couldnt have her way besides
she was strong mrs babbie would
be glad to have her jan had run
the silver duke

her aunts home for years why
not let her try it
  come along then since youre so
determined anne decided and the
girls went to get annes car
  down through lovely tree-shaded
beverly and across the tracks where
in the narrow space between rail-
road tracks and docks lived the
other half janine had never been
across the tracks for aunt millie
had been firm about not letting her
visit the junior leagues pet charity
the margaret home for wayward
girls
  mrs babbie a plump motherly-
looking person did not ask any
questions but fell upon annes
choice of a new helper with open
arms
  there was no room for janine to
live at the honie but mrs babbie
gave her the address where her for-
mer assistant had stayed
  anne was horrified at the small
attic room but jan said it would do
nicely and still in her mutinous
mood paid her months rent in ad-
vance shed have to share it with
one lizette greer a factory worker
  when janine reached her aunts
home again she found that aunt
millie had gone to the country club
with lutie and had not left as she
usually did a note telling jan to
follow janine who had been rap-
idly weakening grew angry once
more and hurriedly packed her
things then she left the house she
had come to as a sad long-curled
nine-year-old
  her roommate was curiously
awaiting her arrival she was a thin
attractive girl with odd slanting
eyes that never looked straight into
janines
  aint you going to unpack every-
thing she asked when janine had
unpacked what she thought suit-
able for swantown and left the rest
in her trunk janine had known
just how silly the other clothes
would look in swantown those long
flowered chiffons starched laces
rough sports silks silver and gold
slippers exquisite silk underthings
shed been silly to bring them but
she had not known what else to do
  if she could have trusted lizette
janine would have shown her the
clothes and told her what had hap-
pened but something in lizettes
shifty glance repelled her so she
kept silent in the days that fol-
lowed when she dived into the trunk
for this possession or that and ex-
posed the lovely things lizette only
looked knowing so janine guessed
that her roommate had been
through the trunk but she didnt
care
  life at the margaret was hard
but janine learned rapidly and mrs
babbie was overjoyed because the
junior leaguers had all gone north
for the summer janine did not have
to dodge her former friends
  with some of the girls she easily
made friends but some remained
hard and sullen to the last of them
all jan grew really fond of only one
  buddy draconi was a beautiful
black-eyed girl with curly dark hair
and soft white skin it took a long
time to win her confidence but when
janine did buddy was pathetic in
her eagerness to be friends
  her story was unusual as jan had
suspected it would be she had been
loved by two men rival gangsters
and had married one to be promptly
widowed by the other a friend had
brought her to the margaret and
as buddy said no one would think
of looking for buddy draconi in
this joint leastways not danny the
knife
  it was soon after this strange
friendship began that buddy burst
out with i bet the silver duke

street  smiths love story magazine
would be crazy about you jimmy
youre his kind
  the silver duke jan repeated
smilingly
  yes hes a swell like you just
a night bird like the rest of us only
shows up after dark a gangster
see
 but why the silver duke
janine asked carelessly not because
she was interested her feet ached
and so did her head and back she
was sick to death of swantown and
its squalor sick of the smells and
people the gangsters who frankly
claimed to be nothing else
  my buck named him that the
first night he came to car minis
his eyes are exactly like silver coins
and he was such a real swell buck
called him the silver duke and it
stuck
  janine went on filing her nails
listening carelessly wouldnt anne
laugh to hear buddy proposing that
janine broun have a blind date with
a gangster named the silver
duke certainly she had hidden
janine well under the jimmy
brown that swantown knew
  a trifle curiously she eyed her-
self in the narrow mirror opposite
a shabbily dressed girl with ruffled
copper hair cut just a little longer
than a boys because the old janine
had worn hers long bunched at the
nape of her neck she was white
and the old janine would be brown
by now the pallor made her mouth
startlingly scarlet
  oh gosh here he is now
buddys eager voice interrupted
jans thoughts and jan looked up
with a start of dismay into eyes
that were as buddy had said as
cool and silvery as coins it was a
long way to look too for he was
well over six feet tall strong but
slim-hipped in his white trousers
and white turtle-necked sweater he
did not look different from the
crowd she ran with and not at all
as she had thought a dweller of
swantown would look
  this is jimmy brown duke and
shes a swell jane only shes half
dead she works harder than any of
the other dames around here
buddy introduced them
 buddy just one word of
laughing dismay in a warm drawl-
ing voice that for some reason sent
a tingle through janine
  aw nix duke on making me
talk your way but isnt she a pretty
keen kid
  very keen somehow janine
found her hand in a cool firm clasp
and she was returning the dukes
sim
  take her for a ride duke shes
tired and hot buddy suggested
im taking another girls turn at
the teleihone to-night
  janine wanted to protest but
didnt janine broun going riding
wtith a man from swantown never-
theless she found herself going down
the hot street with the tall young
man his hand touching her arm at
the crossings
  she didnt even think much about
her rashness in trusting herself to
him in the hot darkness of swan-
town looking back over that night
she wondered why she hadnt been
afraid especially as he guided her
toward the docks dark shapes
slunk in and out of the shadows
and spoke to the duke in gutturals
the water slapped sullenly against
the docks and only the riding lights
of the moored freighters relieved the
darkness
  why its a boat not a car
janine said with real pleasure as her
companion stayed her steps at a slip
where a speed boat tugged at its
moorings
  scared
the silver duke

  a little janine admitted
honestly
  dont be ill take good care of
you and see that you get safely
home again we can go up the
shore a ways and get steamed clams
and cold beer at a place i know
dance too if you want to
  janine nodded and he picked her
up and put her into the boat as
easily as if she had been a doll
  the boat went like the wind
seeming to leap into the velvet
night away they roared out of the
bay and up the coast line janine
drew in great lungfuls of the fresh
air and gradually the tiredness the
horrible weariness left her
  at a dock miles up the coast the
duke shut off the engine and they
floated to anchor beside a long
dimly lighted building music
reached out gay hands to them and
janines feet tingled to be dancing
once more even though it was with
a swantownian
  the building was crude on the
outside but inside there was an ex-
cellent floor with tables all around
the dimly lighted room a good
orchestra and an oyster bar that
went the entire length of the room
  duke might have been carleton
vance himself he was so courteous
and janine forgot that he wasnt
some new boy whom she had met
in beverly oh well she was just
jimmy brown now and girls of
swan ton went with men like the
silver duke and danny the knife
  like it the duke asked bend-
ing his tall head as they finished
their cold beer and fried oysters to
join the dancers
  i love it it was nice of you to
invite me buddy practically shang-
haiied you into it janine laughed
  no she didnt i could have
said i had a date truth is im
fed up on this lone-wolf business
and keen on having a pretty girl
to dance with
  i thought if young men didnt
have those tilings it was because
they didnt want them observed
janine innocently surely there
are plenty of good-looking girls just
aching to go places
  the face of the man looked bleak
and his mouth became a grim line
jan looked at him in surprise now
he looked like the other men oi
swantown and she had thought him
different then he laughed
  maybe there arent too many
jimmy browns in swantown he
said lightly you cant tell me you
were born there
  not very far from where i stay
now janine said quietly i had
been away working but i had to
leave so i came to the margaret
when i heard there was a job open
there
  i should think youd be too
good-looking to be out in service
you wouldnt be a comfortable per-
son for other girls to be with under
the same roof
  janine looked quickly at her com-
panion but lie was plainly not try-
ing to flatter her for he was look-
ing thoughtiuijy over her head evi-
dently thinking ever what she had
said
  that was the reason i left an-
other girl made her mother fire me
janine admitted
 the door swung open and a
group of young people rushed in and
took possession of the bar janine
started for at their head was lutie
who should have been at their
northern summer home her
cousins companions were strangers
to her
  lutie pounded on the bar ac-
tion we want action
  janine winced hoping lutie

street  smiths love story magazine
luties cold black eyes pounced upon janines companion or he was
a striking figure and she strutted over to them and put her hand on his
arm break big man and dance with lutie she commanded
wouldnt discover her in the dim-	and pushed a button flooding the
ness	room with light
  it was evident lutie knew the	lutie was in slacks with a very
place for she went over to a wall	insufficient bandanna tied around
ls-a-
the silver duke

her neck and tucked into the front
of the slacks leaving her brown back
bare she was attractive in a gay
gypsyish way but the oyster bar
was not the only kind of bar she
had frequented that night she
swayed dizzily as she walked
  her cold small black eyes
pounced upon janines companion
first for he was a striking figure
and she strutted over to them and
put her hand on his arm
  break big man and dance with
lutie she commanded in her high
voice aw dont be so cross she
shrilled as the duke coolly swung
away from her hand she stared in-
solently at his companion then
blinked well for goshs sake see
who hes toting say big boy you
neednt go to the kitchen for dates
 ls-a
  janines cheeks were
scarlet with embarrass-
ment she looked up at
the duke but he had
shaken lutie off and was
smiling down at janine as
though they were alone
  janine caught her breath
at the miracle of that smile
it did queer things to her
lutie was staring too and
slowly turning scarlet he
looked at her and her eyes
wavered before the cold sil-
ver lances of the dukes
glance
  her partner a sleek-
haired fellow grabbed
lutie roughly by the arm
and whirled off with her
served you right lutie
for stepping out of your
class
  say she cant get away
with that luties voice
was shrill with fury im
going to tell him a mouth-
ful about her she hasnt
anything to be so snooty
about and im not through with
him either hes going to dance
with me and like it
  ready to go out where the air
is cleaner the duke asked dis-
tinctly and at jans relieved nod
he guided her out of the door into
the night that the girl who got
you fired he asked and janine
nodded again glad she had not had
to claim relationship with lutie
  lutie was at the bar now jan
could see her there as she sat in the
boat waiting for the duke to start
the motor lutie was questioning
the nearest chef jans eyes spar-
kled angrily why couldnt lutie
leave her alone now that she had
driven her away from the only home
she had ever known
  shell find out who you are and

street  smiths love story magazine
chase after you im afraid ive
made trouble for you by coming to-
night jan said regretfully
  so you too know im hiding
the duke said thoughtfully well
dont let it worry you she cant
harm me even if she drags me into
the sunshine of-beverly isnt it
  yes thats where she lives
janine replied marveling at his
quickness
  it would have to be theres
only swantown beverly and the
campau
  swantown put out a hot hand
reeking of asphalt as they left the
docks and the speed boat behind
janine shivered a little it was for
a girl like lutie she had chosen this
life lutie wasnt worth it she
should have ignored her taunts and
stayed where she belonged and that
wasnt prowling about with a hiding
criminal
  the duke with his uncanny
quickness seemed to guess her
thoughts for he said quickly dont
worry im safe company even for a
tired little girl from the margaret
home
  this is where i live janine said
quickly confused on the top
floor
  isnt it beastly hot up there
  when it is my roommate and
i take army cots to the roof its
cool up there under the stars she
paused the ride was lovely
duke
  you made it so jimmy im
going to take you often
  janine didnt believe he would
he wasnt safe for janine broun
she was afraid already he made
her heart beat fast would he ex-
pect her to kiss him good night
  kisses didnt mean much to the
crowd janine had known maybe if
he did kiss her it would cure her of
her growing infatuation she was
instantly ashamed of the thought
but it was too late the dukes
arms closed about her hard and his
face smooth and cool was close to
hers then his mouth crushed down
on hers hot and fierce until she
gasped for breath for a moment
he held her there against the virile
steel that was his body his mouth
taking her very heart through her
lips then he released her and
melted into the darkness
  well lizettes voice came
from the darkness and she raced
after janine who was rushing up the
stairs baby face and the silver
duke teaming up whod have
thought hed fall for you
  buddy draconi asked him to
take me for a ride on the water to
cool off janine stammered because
lizettes eyes looked so knowing
  id say he did the opposite
well kid hes rolling in do-re-mi
they say he did a big job and is in
hiding until they quit looking for
him draconi claims hes horribly
moral if thats so you better tip
him off to your past even gang-
sters have codes yknow
 am i being dumb janine
asked catching up her cotton pa-
jamas and starting for the bath-
room
  aw come off guess i know
about you i suppose you didnt
come here straight from one of the
doll apartments of campau ive
seen the glad rags in the trunk only
id have thought you could have
held your man longer
  janine went  to the bathroom
puzzled then suddenly she
laughed of course lizette would
think that the city was divided
into three parts beverly where the
people of the idle class lived swan-
town and the campau which con-
sisted of the houses beyond the
theaters where rich young men
the silver duke

maintained apartments for enter-
taining their friends-often girls
from swantown with whom they
amused themselves until their fancy
changed lizette had decided that
janine had been discarded by a
fickle young playboy well let her
think it if it helped jan to hide
more securely
  nevertheless she wouldnt go
around with the duke but she
didnt know the duke nor anything
about the terrible heat that lay like
a pall over swantown turning its
streets to black rubber its skies to
brassy smoke and good resolutions
into thin air
  janine was glad to get away at
night with the duke to the clean
cool water where they spent the
evening hours racing up the coast
he seemed to have unlimited funds
and janine grimly pushed the
thought of their source into the batik
of her mind along with the other
self who had once been safe in
beverly
  buddy disappeared suddenly one
night and the duke professed not
to know where she had gone jan
missed the vivacious black-eyed
adoring buddy more than she had
expected aside from anne buddy
was the only real friend janine had
had and it hurt incredibly to have
her go without even a good-by
  the duke had not repeated that
mad kiss sometimes he seemed to
be laughing at himself about some-
thing often he stayed away days
at a time but always he came back
useless to tell herself she was janine
broun of beverly she was really
jimmy brown madly in love with
a man who dared not show his face
in the daylight
  hurrying along the street on an
errand one day janine surprisingly
met lutie face to face-lutie slim
and cool and elegant in her float-
ing flowered dress and wide hat
janine stepped in surprise
  what on earth lutie broun are
you doing down here
  i could ask the same only i hap-
pen to know lutie jeered
  what do you mean lutie i
thought you had gone north long
ago 
  lutie shrugged we were all
ready to go when i ran into you that
night ive been looking for you
ever since why not come home
ill admit i was mean but you got
my goat im going to marry carle-
ton vance soon as everybody gets
back from the resorts so you can
come home now
  why lutie how nice janine
said slowly
  nice nothing if you come
naturally the silver duke will tag
along and i owe that guy plenty
she flung out angrily
  janine gasped you mean you
want the duke there
  sure you could melt here and
i wouldnt raise a finger lutie re-
torted cruelly but i cant keep on
coming here to see the duke i
want to strut him before the girls
too
 come down here to see the
duke you mean-
  sure laughed lutie didnt
he tell you ive been to his apart-
ment often but he wont come where
i am seems to dislike daylight
she said hatefully
  i think you are terrible lutie
broun gasped janine shaken with
rage the duke and lutie was
that the reason she hadnt been see-
ing so much of him
  lutie shrugged and laughed but
her thin face was flushed
  i thought you were a nut to
come here but now i see oh i
got it out of anne mother worried
so where did you meet him jan

street  smiths love story magazine
oh does it matter janine
cried cant you leave me alone
well how about coming back

cousin janine asked
  no you had kept it quiet so i
did too coming back
  no flared janine angrily now

  lutie laughed suppose i tell
the police that the man they want

slip

  not unless my other plans fail
hes rather a touch-me-not isnt he
but when that type fall they fall
hard and im going to be right
there for him to fall on
  but you have carleton janine
reminded her
  say you dont think wrere in
love his dad and my mother are
crazy for the match but carleton
and i made an agreement that were
each to have our own fun
  janine turned away without re-
plying she heard luties high sil-
very laugh following her like the
jangle of small brazen bells and her
face flushed with fury
  lutie and the duke lutie and
the duke it rang in her ears all
the long evening as she sat on the
edge of her cot looking up at the
silver stars swinging in the black
velvet sky the duke hadnt been
at the margaret to bring her home
to-night lutie had coaxed him
away with her somewhere and if she
had not hated her cousin before
janine hated her now with an in-
tense consuming hatred
  that night alone in the tiny
room she faced the real truth
something that she had been afraid
to do until now she knew she
loved the duke loved him so craz-
ily madly that nothing else on
earth mattered time not spent
with him was a nightmare to be
lived somehow
  it was nearly nine the next night
when janine finished her work at
the margaret the duke wasnt
waiting there to-night either
  slowly drearily janine went
home she walked up the hot reek-
ing stairs to her room and as she
stood fumbling for her key she
heard lizettes voice and with it the
dukes and was instantly wildly
happy once more as she opened
the door lizette sprang up
  i asked the duke up to wait
im off for a weok-end at eddies
mas lizette explained and hur-
ried out
  janine looked at the duke he
was standing beside her open trunk
it wasnt the first time she had come
home to find that lizette had been
rummaging in it expensive dresses
and silken lingerie were strewn over
the edge of it a silver slipper lay
on the dingy carpet a lacy negligee
was thrown over a chair all the
lovely clothes aunt millie had man-
aged to shower on her niece were
exposed to the dukes eyes
  lizette was showing me your
things he said in an odd voice he
whirled catlike and caught janine
by the shoulders shaking her until
her hair flew in a wild mess over her
face jimmy i could have sworn
you were as sweet and honest as you
looked
  janine stared at him dazzled
his eyes wrere flaming he cared as
much as that
  i actually walked the floor nights
swearing because i hadnt kissed
you again i held off because your
mouth was so untaught i thought
i find you are my equal-no worse
for i never claimed to be anything
the silver duke	
he caught janine by the shoulders shaking her i could have sworn
you were as sweet and honest as you looked he cried now i and you
are worse than i am no good girl could have things like yours and get
them by doing housework
but the silver duke a man who has	tried to tell me that first night and
to hide	i thought she was jealous well
 what do you mean	ive learned the truth now from
  i mean you came here from the	 her from lizette and from these
campau that was what lutie	no good girl could have things like

street  smiths love story magazine
yours and get them by doing house-
work
  go away janine cried if you
think that of me you cant go too
quickly
  before i satisfy my hunger for
your mouth he cried savagely
  something in his face made janine
cry out wait let me-
  i wont wait he cried roughly
and crushed her close to him she
could feel the steely muscles that so
often had made her think of a
tigers she struggled to free her-
self from the savagery of the mouth
that swept down hers couldnt and
then she didnt want to all she
wanted was him to keep on kissing
her in this mad way time enough
for explanations later
  tides of magic were sweeping over
her carrying her away from the safe
harbors janine broun had known
she had become a wild thing in the
silver dukes arms oh shed
gladly marry him and hide with him
what did she care for beverly and
its calm prearranged marriages
  things were whirling about her
and some of the madness passed
she was fighting a force she couldnt
understand fighting the duke and
losing under his hot cruel lips then
she was sent staggering back against
the wall and the silver duke was
gone
  slowly the room straightened and
became just a dingy room in swan-
town the magic that had trans-
formed it was ugly passion that had
nearly carried her away in its swift
current
  janine sank down into a chair
shaking from head to foot she
knew now why buddy had married
a gangster dark-eyed vivacious
buddy why janine was so in love
with the silver duke she couldnt
even think straight
  perhaps she slept she never after-
ward knew but somehow the hot
dawn was in the room and she was
draggingly dressing for another day
a day without the duke for he
wouldnt be back ever and she
couldnt do as lutie did-follow him
to explain and coax him back
  at mrs babbies door janine
saw annes car anne was upstairs
in the margaret waiting for her
she cried out at the sight of janine
and put her arms around her
  poor kid you look all in i came
just in time i guess
  i thought you were still up
north jan said dropping into a
chair
  no we came home early it
wasnt any fun without you i sup-
pose you know that your aunt and
lutie didnt go after all thats
what i came about to ask you to
come home
  did lutie send you jan asked
coldly
  no dont be that way with me
jan your aunt sent for you lutie
and carleton eloped last night and
saved the trouble and expense of a
big wedding his house is nearly
done so they plan to stay at a re-
sort until it is ready your aunt al-
ways wanted you back but we both
knew you wouldnt come until lutie
left 
  i cant leave mrs babbie with-
out notice janine said weakly and
it seemed as though shed die if she
didnt get out of swantown right
away
  anne smiled the girl who used
to work for her came back so you
can leave this minute
  janine felt faint from relief anne
studied her white face anxiously
but janine rallied almost at once
and in no time at all her packing
was done good-bys at the home
wrere said and the two girls were
the silver duke

driving away from the heat and sor-
didness of swantown jan was glad
she didnt have to see lizette again
  she was filled with hatred for the
girl who had lied to the duke out
of petty malice maybe some day
shed thank lizette but not while
the pain of losing the duke was an
open wound in her heart
  i suppose youve seen a lot of
lutie anne said calmly as they
bumped across the last of the tracks
into beverly she bragged that
she was going with some handsome
thug down there
  janine did not reply she was
drawing deep breaths of the clean
air of wide shaded streets behind
her was swantown and all its sor-
didness and heat the madness of
loving the silver duke-that should
be put behind her too she was
once more janine broun and even
lutie could not drive her back to
swantown
  aunt millie and sukey both wept
when janine got home to her sur-
prise it was no effort at all to pick
up the threads of her former life
and go on every one knew through
anne that janine had been doing
social work at the margaret they
were glad to have her back and the
chapter of the summer in swantown
seemed gone and forgotten
  but not for janine she could be
busy all day and dance half the
night but in the long hours of early
morning she would live over every
moment she had spent with the sil-
ver duke in her dreams she felt
again the spray on her face as his
boat took them up the coast and
wakened to find it was her own
tears
  the first day after lutie and
carleton returned lutie followed
janine to her room and shut the
door
  does the duke come here jan
she demanded going to the point
lutie-fashion
  no i havent seen him since i
left the margaret
  t have i saw him riding with
buddy draconi she lives along the
ocean at that big place that was shut
so long what was the trouble be-
tween you two
  nothing he left swantown be-
fore i did janine answered gravely
  i know that too i was at his
rooms that night he was packing
when i got there and was in a tear-
ing rage about something his face
was so white it scared me he
seemed to have some crazy idea
from lizette greer that you had
come to the margaret from the
campau
  janines violet eyes widened he
told you that
  no i picked it out of him
what did you tell him she
asked in a strained voice
  why you fool what would i tell
him i said it was so that carle-
ton was mad about you and that
when we got engaged i made him
get rid of you lutie laughed at
the sight of janines face did you
think id tell him that you were
just too pretty to have around when
i wanted to catch a rich man
why not you already had
carleton janine said in a strangely
dead voice
  i wanted him too lutie coolly
lighted a cigarette if he had even
looked at me carleton could have
had you and welcome but he didnt
i even threatened to tell the police
about him and he just laughed
luties voice was choked with fury
i dont believe he was hiding from
the police so you lost him to dra-
coni
  janine refused to reply and
finally lutie left

street  smiths love story magazine
  after she had gone janine stood
for a long time in deep thought
she too knew where buddy was
living only the other day she had
seen her on the lawn of a big house
facing the sea buddy had not seen
her and janine smarting from
buddys abrupt ending of their
friendship had taken care that she
shouldnt
  well she was going to find buddy
now and through her learn where
the duke was hiding then shed
set him straight about her she
wouldnt have even a gangster be-
lieve the awful things lutie had told
about her hed realized the truth
once she told him her name after
that she would forget him as fast
as she could
  janine dressed in her simplest
things a coat of silky blue wool
with a severe nuns cape edged with
silver fox a beret of the same ma-
terial tilted on her coppery hair
slim blue pumps in her aunts
small coupe janine set out to call
on buddy
  janine was in luck for buddy was
walking down the driveway of the
big house she stared coldly at
janine as the girl brought her car
to a stop beside her
  well she said in an unfriendly
tone cool black eyes sweeping jans
smart figure
  get in here jan commanded
her voice as cold
  at the note of command in
janines voice buddy stared then
obeyed
  first i want you to tell me why
you left without a word
  buddys black eyes flashed i
thought i wasnt fit company for a
nice girl like you and the duke
agreed so he helped me beat it if
id known-
  you didnt know anything and
neither does the duke see janine
said angrily did you ever hear
of janine broun of beverly
  buddy nodded shes a junior
leaguer she said sullenly
  well that happens to be who i
am janine said coldly my
cousin lutie broun came home
from school and she was a scrawny
little thing out for a rich husband
and i cramped her style so she made
her mother send me away a friend
of mine knew mrs babbie needed
a helper and i insisted on taking
the job thats the whole story
my family didnt know where i was
for a long time and when they did
they sent for me lutie was mar-
ried so i went home
  buddys big black eyes had grown
wider and wider and when janine
finished she made a little stabbing
motion with her hand
  you shoulda bumped off that
lizette greer and your cousin for
giving the duke a wrong steer how
come you didnt tell him the truth
  because i was a snob jan said
honestly he was hiding from the
law and i didnt want to fall in
love with him its all right i just
wanted you to know you can tell
him ive got to get back now
janines voice was unsteady and to
her horror one tear after another be-
gan to slide down her lovely face
  buddy gave her a quick hug
get back nothing you come
along with me to supper lucky
you got me when you did because
danny and i are beating it out west
to start over oh dont look like
that i married him to get him be-
cause his mob got buck and then
i got weak and liked him too much
so were going west isnt that a
joke danny the knife going
straight and turning farmer but
buddys tone was proud
  you arent with the duke then
i might have known lutie was lying
the silver duke	
again janine said slowly of
course ill stay for supper
 buddy leaned forward and
snapped on the car switch and jan
drove up to the house and followed
buddy in through a side door
  were staying with some folks
danny knew buddy said hustling
janine into a great cool living room
ill go set an extra place drop
somewhere i wont be a minute
janine looked around the room
a sound
in the door-
way made her
look up and she
stared wide-eyed the
silver duke stood there
for a moment she saw sur-
prise and stark hunger mirrored
in his face then he seemed to don a
mask that shut her out

street  smiths love story magazine
it was a cool day so there was a
low fire flickering on the hearth
three kittens tumbled there buddy
and kittens-janine smiled at the
thought and bent to pet them a
sound in the doorway made her
straighten up and she stared wide-
eyed
  the silver duke stood there look-
ing at her for a moment she saw
surprise and stark hunger mirrored
in his face then he seemed to don
a mask that told her nothing shut
her out
  buddy did not tell me stam-
mered janine then hushed for her
voice sounded strange in her own
ears
  why did you come jimmy the
duke asked stiffly
  i came to find buddy i wanted
her to know she had me all wrong
and so did you lutie lied and
lizette lied lutie told me about it
to-day those clothes and these i
earned myself i am living with
luties mother again as her com-
panion the same position i had be-
fore lutie came home from school
  why she didnt tell him she was
janine broun jan never could after-
ward fathom but that small omis-
sion saved her happiness
 the duke came forward and
turned janines face to the light his
hand under her chin a thrill went
through janine at his touch then
she was still but her breath was
hurrying hurrying
  i believe you jimmy i went
back to find you and found you had
gone but lizette was there i choked
the truth out of her she admitted
she knew nothing about your past
that she had lied it didnt matter
nothing mattered except finding
you
  janine felt the room swing about
her and at her white look the duke
put his arms around her was it
that way with you too jimmy did
you love me enough so that the past
didnt matter
  janines pride became a thing of
dust yes yes she cried her
arms creeping up around his neck
  would you marry me now not
knowing anything more about me
jimmy
 could we i mean without
waiting days for red tape and all
that janine asked bravely
  i attended to that-i got the
license long ago mrs babbie gave
me your full name j m brown but
she didnt know any more than
that
  buddys laughing face suddenly
appeared between the curtains
  buddy call that judge who lives
down the street right away ordered
the duke in a gay voice that janine
had never heard from him before
  when buddy disappeared the
duke looked down at janine
  you meant it and at her shin-
ing look he bent his tall head so he
could reach her lips this time
janine returned his kiss with all the
hungry longing of the long weeks
they had been separated it was
heaven to feel his arms around her
hurting her the hard firmness of his
mouth bruising hers recklessly
she put behind her all her doubts
and fears
 buddy brought them back to
earth triumphantly leading the
plump judge and a tall handsome
blond youth who did not look at all
as janine had thought danny the
knife would look
  in no time at all just as she was
in her blue dress and blue coat and
tumbled coppery hair janine be-
came mrs silver duke of course
he had another name-neal riding
it was as unfamiliar as that of silver
duke had been to her a few weeks
before
the silver duke

  maybe our wedding wont be ex-
actly legal janine murmured con-
fusedly when she discovered that
buddy and danny and the judge
had vanished
  it was the first thing she could
think of to say under the shining-
ness of the dukes eyes
  one letter ought not to matter
she added gaining courage just
try letting it matter whether im
jimmy brown or janine broun
the dukes arms loosened and he
said something under his breath
that sounded like swearing
  jimmy  jimmy you blessed
idiot why didnt you say so before
there was a choked groan in liis
voice not that the difference of
a letter matters but if i had known
i would never have married you
then im glad you didnt know
anyway i havent a cent to my
name except what aunt millie gives
me for an allowance janine put
her head firmly back where it had
been tucked under the dukes chin
you dont understand janine
broun was mad to marry a man like
me without knowing all about him
then she loves being mad you
-you didnt kill any one
  for a moment the duke held
janine close without answering then
he walked over to a desk and
brought her a handful of clippings
read them he commanded in a
harsh voice
  reluctantly janine bent over
them it was a sordid story of a
man who had killed his wife and her
lover then himself and how his son
the innocent member of a tragic
family one neal darrel had been
hounded by the tabloids until his life
had become unbearable and he had
disappeared
  that poor boy neal darrel was
you duke janine asked her voice
soft with pity but you said neal
riding-
  i had one friend a judge who
had my name changed to riding i
came down here and bought this
place but the habit of hiding was
too strong i lived in daily fear of
some sob sister ferreting me out
only in the shadows of swantown
did i feel safe
  and that was all janine asked
a great relief flooding her with hap-
piness you never were a gangster
at all
  never but dont- you see some
day some one will recognize me as
that unfortunate son of a father
temporarily crazed by his wifes un-
faithfulness thank heaven she
was my stepmother not my real
mother theyll force you to five
through that hasbed-up scandal
  as if i care janine said with
loving scorn i wont be afraid of
anything as long as i have you
janine looking up into his eyes
shivered with happiness as his arms
closed about her and his lips
crushed down on hers hot and
fierce in a kiss which made their
very souls one forever
the fourth proposal
                       by mona morrow
quired with more than ordinary in-
terest
it was nothing important
mother thelma answered indiffer-
ently as she tossed an empty box
into a corner of the compartment
he wanted to come along and
marry me at the first stop
and- mrs huston eagerly
prompted since thelma had offered
  i s the train rolled out of the
station on its westward jour-
ney mrs huston pale and
grave sat quietly with her hands in
her lap while thelma bubbling with
excitement opened the various gift
boxes that had been brought by her
many friends
 what did larry want when he
called you aside mrs huston in-
the fourth proposal

no information as to what her reply
had been
  i told him he was just wasting
a proposal on me i couldnt pos-
sibly see him as a husband
  mrs huston sighed and touched
a weak hand to her iron-gray hair
i dont know what you are waiting
for thelma she said kindly and
concernedly the average girl
considers herself fortunate if she gets
one proposal youve had three that
i know of nice young men too
arent you making a mistake pass-
ing up all these fine opportunities
the man you are waiting for may
not even exist he may only be a
creature of your imagination youll
be twenty-three next month you
know
  dont worry dear thelma
laughed i wont die an old maid
  mrs iluston made no answer
her mind went back over a bridge
of years she thought of her own
sister roberta who at one time was
pretty and charming and vivacious
as thelma was now roberta had
rejected many offers while waiting
for an ideal who never came the
years crept up and she eventually
resigned herself to spinsterhood
with all her heart and soul mrs
huston prayed that that would not
be thelmas fate
  abruptly stopping her exploring
thelma put her arms around her
mother just forget about me
she said and think of yourself
only youve got a job ahead of
you youve got to get strong and
healthy surprise new york when
you get back
  without a seconds hesitation
thelma had volunteered to go with
her mother to the bar x dude
ranch in montana which the doctor
had recommended a six months
stay the doctor felt would make a
new person of mrs huston
  however thinking always of
thelmas future mrs huston ob-
jected to her going along it would
be a waste of six precious months
of her life but thelma insisted and
the idea of a nurse for a companion
was discarded
  john cromwell the owner of the
dude ranch a husky six-footer
escorted thelma and her mother
down the row of log cabins to the
one in which they would live during
their stay he wore hand-tooled
boots a ten-gallon hat and a red
plaid shirt that always impressed
easterners
  as thelma glanced from left to
right taking in the immediate sights
of the ranch her eyes suddenly wid-
ened and unconsciously her steps
became shorter on the porch of
one of the log cabins sat an excep-
tionally handsome young man of
about twenty-eight his dark-blond
hair was brushed back smartly and
his strong white teeth were clamped
on a curved pipe he was reading
a book and was so absorbed that
he never raised his head at the
sound of their approach
  a feeling of breathless excitement
surged through thelmas veins her
heart suddenly commenced to race
a strange and pleasing warmth en-
veloped her body her lips parted
in a blessed smile and her eyes shone
with an instinctive recognition
  her head nodded slightly yes
that was the man she had been wait-
ing for that was the man whose
vague image had filled her dreams
for so long she had ilways felt
that somebody like him simply must
exist and that some day she would
find him
  an insatiable curiosity seized hold
of her who was he where did
he come from
  she quickened her steps and

street  smiths love story magazine
caught up with mr cromwell who
was holding her mothers arm
that man looks jamiliar to me
she remarked after they had passed
his cabin who is lie
 thats mr stephen ross
cromwell informed her hes here
with his brother philip ross they
come from chicago theyre in the
steamship business mr philip is
going to be here all summer but mr
stephen is leaving at the end of the
week
  the information was welcome
though not very promising but
there was one thing she desired to
know above all others was he
single
  she didnt want to ask the ques-
tion point-blank so going home
to his wife she asked her heart
trembling at what the answer might
be
  no dont think hes married
  gladness and relief swelled her
heart yes it had to be this way
there should be no barriers when
she found him
  here we are cromwell an-
nounced stopping at the next cabin
while you were having lunch i
had your trunks put inside i hope
youll be very comfortable
  there were four rooms in the
cabin-two bedrooms a living room
with an open fireplace and a bath-
room that held a tub and shower
indian blankets and game trophies
hung on the walls hand-woven
rag rugs were scattered over the
wooden floors each room was pro-
vided with electricity from the
ranchs own power plant like all
dude ranches it combined the best
features of the outdoor west with
many of the comforts of the east
  thelma suggested that her mother
he down and rest while she un-
packed the windows were wide
open and a fine sweet-smelling
breeze fanned the rooms before she
was half finished thelma noticed
that her mother had fallen asleep
that was perfect the more rest
her mother got the sooner would
she regain her health
 thelma took a shower and
changed her dress from the win-
dow of her bedroom she saw
stephen on the porch of his cabin
i wonder she said half aloud if
youve been waiting for me as ive
been waiting for you im coming
over and i hope you get the same
sort of shock when you see me that
i got when i saw you
  assuring herself that her mother
was asleep she strolled out with a
glad heart near stephens cabin
she halted and contemplated him
for a moment how are you
neighbor she called out gayly
  he raised his head for a second
his blue eyes showed keen surprise
thelmas jet-black hair glistened in
the sun her large expressive gray
eyes shaded by long black lashes
sparkled with an intriguing friendli-
ness she presented an exquisite
picture as she stood there stlm and
straight then his eyes clouded
how do he answered coldly and
dropped his eyes to his book again
dismissing her completely
  aghast thelma stood there in a
state of bewilderment she had
been snubbed it seemed incredible
and shocking too after what she
had anticipated
 something was wrong men
usually warmed to her found her
interesting and desirable it didnt
seem possible that this man for
whom she felt she had been waiting
all her life shouldnt even desire to
exchange a word with her it sent
a little shiver through her
  for a moment she hesitated then
thrust out her chin and deliberately
walked up the wooden steps of the
aghast thelma stood there in a state of bewilderment she had been
snubbed it seemed incredible something was wrong men usually
warmed to her found her interesting and desirable
porch she dropped into a chair im sure it must be something
opposite him and crossed one silken you ate she said with a friendly
leg over the other	smile you couldnt possibly have
the fourth proposal

street  smiths love story magazine
such a bad disposition mr ross
  his brows narrowed as he stared
at her he couldnt help but notice
that she possessed a rare beauty
a beauty that was more than per-
fect features a beauty that was
vitally alive but he had no use
for girls especially beautiful girls
  i dont believe ive ever met you
before he said with no eagerness in
his voice
  you havent she answered
im thelma huston im here
with my mother in the next cabin
i asked mr cromwell and he told
me your name i didnt bring any
recommendations with me but i
think if youll put the book aside
you might find that im not terribly
boring
  im sorry he said abruptly
but im not in a conversational
mood besides i just remembered
that i have some letters to write
  he rose to his feet tall and hand-
some a romantic figure with a
white broadcloth shirt that was open
at the throat
  thelma waited a few moments
her cheeks stained red then got up
and walked slowly back to her own
cabin in all her life no man had
ever been so rude to her and the
crudest part of all was that she
should receive this rebuff from the
one man in the world whom she was
most anxious to interest
  during the short time that she
had been sitting opposite him she
had felt her heart melt she had
felt that every particle of her be-
longed to him had he held out
his hands to her she would have
come to him in happy surrender he
was cold he was aloof he was cruel
yet deep in her heart she knew
that she had fallen madly in love
with him that he was the one man
she had been waiting for the man
who could stir her without even
touching her
  her mother was still asleep so she
walked about the ranch aimlessly
soon she reached the corral she
leaned against the log fence and
watched the antics of the horses
within her cheeks still burned
  some one came up and stood be-
side her mind if i introduce my-
self that some one asked
  thelma turned her head and saw
a nice-looking young man of twenty-
one the collegiate type rather slim
with pale cheeks not at all she
said although she would have pre-
ferred to be alone
  im phil ross he said im
steves brother i should also add
eavesdropper i happened to be in
the room off the porch when you
came up to the cabin i heard the
whole thing and i felt sorry for you
i think youre swell youre a real
sort of a girl thats why i went
out to look for you
  i want to tell you about steve
hes not as rude as he pretended to
be you just happened to hit him
at a rotten time hes sore at all
girls now and he thinks theyre all
poison
  some time ago a girl named
natalie fulton came up to our place
looking for a job as a stenographer
she was the prettiest thing i had
ever seen steve fell in love with
her on the spot when they went
out there wasnt a head that didnt
turn to stare at her and was he
proud
  two weeks ago she eloped with
a millionaire steve had introduced
to her there was no good-by no
word of regret i always suspected
that she was a gold digger but steve
thought she really loved him
  he came oat here for a few weeks
to forget hes bitter so you see
you stepped in at a bad moment
ls-a
the fourth proposal

  thanks for telling me thelma
said it makes me ieel a lot better
i couldnt imagine how any one
could take such a violent dislike to
me
  he couldnt if he was in his right
senses phil remarked with admir-
ing eyes but under the circum-
stances while that thing is still fresh
in his mind its best to leave him
alone
  her mother awoke in time for din-
ner and together they walked to the
dining hall at one of the small
tables she saw stephen and his
brother phil but stephen never
once looked at her she wondered
what she should do should she
avoid him entirely as his brother had
suggested
  no she kept repeating to herself
but how could you interest a man
if he refused to talk to you if he
walked out on you he was leaving
at the end of the week and some-
thing must be done quickly
  it wasnt howrever until the next
evening that an idea came to
thelma she and her mother were
among the last to leave the dining
hall after dinner they stopped for
a few moments to talk with john
cromwell in reference to some spe-
cial food for mrs huston thea
they strolled along leisurely toward
then cabin
  the idea came like a bolt from
the sky just as they were approach-
ing stephens cabin it was a prom-
ising idea but the fact that her
mother would be involved made
thelma hesitate she weighed it
carefully in her mind then feeling
certain as to the outcome she acted
  youre making a mistake mrs
huston said as thelma led her up
the steps of stephens cabin this
is not our cabin
  i know it but i want you to
meet some one mother
 ls-a
   a mischievous twinkle in her eyes
thelma knocked on the door
stephen answered and when he be-
held the unexpected visitors he was
dumfounded in a fit of temper he
could forget himself and act ungen-
tlemanly toward thelma but never
could he be rude to the pale sweet-
faced woman with the kind eyes
and iron-gray hair who stood beside
her
  hello stephen i brought you a
guest thelma said gayly mother
this is stephen ross a great book
reader and a renowned authority on
etiquette she couldnt resist the
chance of getting even
   for a fraction of a second his eyes
flashed anger then he turned to
thelmas mother and said pleas-
antly how do you do mrs hus-
ton
  thelmas eyebrows went up in a
delightful gesture highly pleased
that he had remembered her second
name wont you show mother
how two bachelors live she asked
pertly it might give her a thrill
and shell have something to write
to dad
  the girl was clever there was
nothing to do but surrender grace-
fully of course he said wont
you come in mrs huston
  thank you mr ross i hope
were not intruding
  dont worry mother thelma
said impishly mr ross just loves
to have people drop in for a chat
  he held the door open for them
philip rose from his chair in the
living room a grin on his face
laughing inwardly over thelmas
strategy
  but once inside thelma discarded
all attempts at sarcasm and became
her own sweet natural self it
wasnt only beauty that made her
the most popular girl in her set that
made her the recipient of three pro-

street  smiths love story magazine
posals she was bright and clever
and witty she had personality and
charm
  but stephen refused to warm to-
ward her he doesnt wafit to like
me she said to herself im beat-
ing against a stone wall
  philip brought out his mandolin
and offered to play if thelma would
sing in a pleasing contralto she
sang a number of popular songs
stephen forgot himself for a mo-
ment and joined in one
  i dont want to spoil this lovely
party mrs huston interrupted
but i feel a bit tired you may
tay thelma but im going back
to our cabin
  oh not alone thelma seized
her opportunity quickly stephen
and i will go with you
  he realized that she had tricked
him in silence they walked to the
huston cabin the air was clear
and a full moon shone down upon
them
 thank you mr ross mrs
huston said i hope youll visit
us sometime you two can go back
now i can manage alone nicely
  as stephen turned to go back
thelma turned with him a short
distance from her cabin she took
hold of his arm with a jerk and
stopped him whats the matter
with me she demanded do i
use the wrong perfume
  a smile hovered on his lips no
what sort of girl was this-he won-
dered 
  then why are you trying to run
away cant you stand me near
you ive done everything but a
fan dance to interest you
  he glared at her and shrugged his
shoulders you do and say the
darnedest things
  but you force me to she re-
plied id much prefer to have you
make the advances
  what he exclaimed
  oh dont be so shocked im
not trying to be smart im not
picking on you for a little fun i
love you do you understand i
know all about the other girl why
dont you let me help you forget
her
 she put gentle hands on his
shoulders stephen look at me
please cant you see that im tell-
ing the truth
  blue eyes looked deep into eyes
of gray and floundered in their
depths all evening he had fought
against liking this girl why should
he believe that she was different
all girls were mercenary didnt
they speak of men as catches
he was all right for natalie until
she met a richer man why should
he put himself in that terrible
humiliating position again he
didnt need a vacation he came
west because he couldnt face his
friends it would be foolish to get
mixed up with another girl even if
she was sweet and adorable
  but her hands on his shoulders did
strange things to him the near-
ness of her was like an intoxicating
perfume her shining eyes and her
soft provocative lips drew him with
a magnetism that overpowered his
reserve
  his arms went around her in an
eager embrace his lips sought hers
and drank deep of their tenderness
their sweetness and their fire he
was stirred beyond words
  for thelma it was the moment
of moments the most perfect kiss
she had ever received
  good night she said softly
when he released her good
night her eyes glowed and her
lips trembled
  in a spirit of ecstasy she fled to
her cabin she wanted to treasure
the fourth proposal

psji
       oz im
not picking
on you for
a little fun i love
you do you under-
stand i know all
about the other girl
why dont you let
me help you forget
her she pleaded
   he stood per-
 fectly still and
 watched her go
 then a fright-
 ened look crept
 into his eyes
 and he hurried
 to his own
 cabin
  mrs huston
 was getting into
 bed when thel-
 ma burst in
 with a cry of
 joy tie kissed
that moment to keep it apart from me mother he kissed me
all others to remember forever	mrs hustons face beamed
if

street  smiths love story magazine
youre bappy so am i i think he
is very nice
  nice thelma echoed hes
wonderful hes the man ive been
waiting for
 the next more ng when she
dressed for breakfast she looked for-
ward joyously to seeing stephen
  she saw philip eating alone and
waved a friendly greeting no
doubt stephen would come in any
moment but the moments dragged
by and there was no sign of him
  she went over to philips table
and asked wheres stephen
he packed and left for chicago
early this morning philip informed
her
  oh she gasped staring at him
with incredulous eyes do you
mean that he has gone away and
wont come back
  philip nodded his head i tried
to reason with him but it was no
use he cant drive natalie fulton
out of his mind and what she did
to him has poisoned him against all
girls im sorry thelma
  thanks she said blinking her
eyes
  she returned to her table and in
answer to her mothers question
told her what had happened but
i cant understand mrs huston
declared you gave me the im-
pression last night that you were in
love with him and that he was in
love with you why should he run
away without saying good-by
thelmas bright-red lips twisted
sadly briefly she told her mother
the truth of her first encounter with
stephen and of the scheme of which
she was not so proud whereby she
had gotten admittance to his cabin
with her mother
  because of her daughters keen
distress mrs huston readily for-
gave her i noticed that he acted
perturbed she said but i thought
it was due to shyness however
i dont approve of your running
after him and apparently he
doesnt either why not forget him
there are so many other men if
you sent a telegram to larry hed
come out here on the first plane
  but i dont want larry her
eyes filled with tears i want
stephen
  she sat around the cabin that
morning as if in a daze his ab-
sence had left a terrible emptiness
in her heart within her there was
a mad desire to go after him but
he was so far away and she dared
not desert her mother
  it was going to be torture stay-
ing here day after day week after
week while he took up his life again
in chicago where there would be
many things to remind him of nata-
lies treachery and to steel his heart
against love what chance did she
stand if he was determined not to
come back to the ranch determined
not to set eyes on her again
  she took up with philip because
she was lonely because he was nice
and because through him she hoped
to hear of stephen philip received
mail from chicago regularly but
thelmas name was never men-
tioned
  all he does philip informed her
is stay home and read when he
gets through at the office it looks
as if he is practicing to be a bachelor
gosh i could ring natalies neck
steve is a swell fellow hasnt an
enemy in the world and now hes
living the life of a hermit i wish
i could shake him out of it
  so did thelma she felt that
there was love behind that kiss
which he had given her love that
he was trying to stifle in time she
feared she would become just a
vague memory to him but how
could she bring him back
the fourth proposal

  exactly two weeks from the day
be had left stephen arrived at the
ranch unexpectedly an angry dis-
turbed and worried stephen whose
mind was filled with hate for
thelma
  say this is a surprise philip
exclaimed what brought you
down
  i want you to pack up stephen
said doctors orders youre go-
ing to another ranch
  what for philip demanded
im getting stronger here every
day what does the old doc know
in chicago i like it here and im
not moving
  stephen regarded his brother sus-
piciously his desire to stay here
merely confirmed the anonymous
letter received by stephen which
had caused him to drop everything
and rush out to the ranch
  but suppose i insist stephen
  well talk it over later philip
retorted ive got a date to go
riding with thelma you know
steve shes a swell girl
  swell girl stephen snickered in-
wardly he was almost tempted to
show him the anonymous letter
but decided not to for the moment
  would you mind waiting here
until i returned stephen asked
id like to see thelma alone for a
few minutes
  o k but dont be long
stephens jaw was set in deter-
mination his eyes blazed with an-
ger as he walked up the wooden
path to thelmas cabin the sound
of his footsteps which she misjudged
for philips brought her to the door
  attired in riding breeches and
boots she looked young and boyish
sweet and lovely for a fraction of
a second his eyes widened then they
turned to cold steel-blue
  hello stephen she cried gayly
as she held out both hands to him
its grand to see you again
  he took her hands and despite
himself felt an electric thrill pass
through his veins hello thelma
he said coldly i want to talk to
you
  how nice she declared ignor-
ing the tone of his voice mother
is asleep and i wouldnt dare dis-
turb her lets go down to the
brook
  they walked the short distance in
silence shall we sit down she
asked with an encouraging smile
  no what i have to say can be
said standing
  you dont sound very pleasant
she remarked while the corners of
her lips curled up mischievously
  im not going to be either i
came to talk about phil i want to
tell you something very bluntly my
father left his business to both of
us but phil doesnt get his share
until he is twenty-five meanwhile
im the boss and i can cut him down
to any salary i wish ill make it
so small youll starve so if you
think youre going to lay your hands
on a fortune by marrying phil
youre doomed to get the surprise
of your life
  what makes you think i want
to marry phil she asked inno-
cently wrhy the idea is ridicu-
lous
  look here he said angrily
you cant fool me i know what
youre up to in every letter that
phil wrote me he mentioned your
name youve been spending an
awful lot of time with him but
dont think it hasnt been noticed
there is some one on this ranch who
knows you-from new york prob-
ably and that some one wrote me
a letter he fumbled in his pocket
here read it
street  smiths love story magazine
 thelma took
the letter from
his hand
without a
trace of emo-
tion she read
without a trace
of emotion
thelma read the
anonymous letter
stephen had re-
ceived saying she
vas a gold dig-
ger who was al-
ways on the make
and not being
able to get him
was now making
a play for his
brother
 my dear mr
stephen ross i
believe it will in-
terest you to know
that thelma hus-
ton is becoming
very friendly with
your brother i happen to know the young
lady very well shes a little gold digger who
is always on the make your brother
doesnt realize the danger he is in i ad-
vise you to take immediate steps to break
up this friendship
                         sincerely
a friend
the fourth proposal

  quite interesting thelma re-
marked returning the letter
  he stared hard at her it doesnt
seem to make you angry at all he
declared which proves that it is
the truth youre not denying it
you are a gold digger you couldnt
get me so you tried to get my
brother her radiant beauty the
look of innocence on her face and
the enigmatic smile on her lips an-
gered him im glad i discovered
you in time he blurted out i was
almost fool enough to fall in love
with you myself i used to sit home
and think of you remember every
word you said and every gesture you
made and especially that moment
when i held you in my arms and
kissed you
  as the days went by i found
myself forgetting natalie thinking
only of you wanting to be with
you wanting to hold you in my
arms again and just as i had de-
cided to come back here i received
that letter
  thelma gasped you were com-
ing back of your own accord her
heart leaped
  yes but now im glad i found
you out youre just another edi-
tion of natalie ill take phil away
from here if i have to do it by
force
it wont be necessary she an-
swered have you a pen in your
pocket and a piece of paper
she probably wanted to write a
note to phil he thought very well
he tore off the unwritten half of
an old letter he had in his pocket
and gave it to her together with his
fountain pen
  in a few moments she rose from
the ground and tossed away the flat
rock on which she had rested the
paper read it please she said
  with incredulous eyes he stared at
it his brows narrowed then he
gazed at her wide-eyed why this
is he gasped an exact copy of
the anonymous letter i received
and its the same handwriting too
did you send it to me
  she smiled at him with glowing
eyes yes i wrote all those terrible
things about myself i wanted you
to come back and it was the only
thing i could think of to bring you
i was afraid youd never come
back
  his face brightened this was no
natalie who stood before him but
a rare and precious creature
  im glad it turned out this way
he said with a sigh i was terribly
upset when i received the letter
but now im the happiest man in
the world what i felt for natalie
was just pride of possession i liked
to display her as you would a beauti-
ful painting but you dearest i
love you with all my heart i dont
want you for the world i want you
for myself only
  his arms went around her hun-
grily and his lips sought hers bless-
ing them with kisses thelma sighed
happily she had gotten the man
she had waited for

billie awoke the next morning
to look out at a dismal rainy
day which exactly matched her
mood to her as she lay in bed
it seemed as if the trials the misery
which should have been divided
among many people had been con-
centrated on her her whole life
had been miserable each bid she
had made for happiness had always
failed turned into misery she had
thought that if she ever found her-
self free to marry len she would
at last have achieved happiness
strand of gold

  now she was free yet fate had
made her free under such circum-
stances of horror and death that she
was worse off than she had been be-
fore she was accused of the mur-
der of her husband with little
chance to free herself from suspi-
cion she wondered why she was
not allowed to enjoy happiness like
other people in the abjectness of
her misery she buried her face in
the pillow and sobbed
  of course there was one thing for
which she could be thankful they
had not arrested her they prob-
ably felt that there was not enough
evidence against her they had
taken her to montycroft the night
before and she was thankful for
her own bed and for freedom even
if it was under surveillance
  she rose and bathed and then
went downstairs to learn what new
developments there had been since
the night before while she break-
fasted the previous nights events
ran through her mind over and over
the one thing which stood out sig-
nificant in her mind wtas the fact
that the canoes had been set adrift
but she could not prove even that
  after breakfast she got the paper
from the front porch and half fear-
ful of what she might find there
she opened it it was the burling-
ton paper first edition off the
presses a little after midnight in time
to come down on the earlv-morning
milk train the information avail-
able at the time of going to press
had been very meager but the story
had been given a good deal of promi-
nence the fact that the excursion-
ists aboard the ticonderoga had
been the first to see the dead man
and that their searchlight had picked
out a woman running away from
the body had been played up mr
robinson the article went on to say
was on the staff of camp arrow-
head it gave too a short resume
of his life evidently gleaned from a
long-distance call to warren
  on the whole it was better than
billie had expected the paper was
careful not to say a word about mur-
der only hint at it and the woman
had not been recognized by those
aboard the ticonderoga
  billie hardly had finished reading
the newspaper account of the trag-
edy when a reporter arrived fol-
lowed almost immediately afterward
by three more billies first inclina-
tion was to refuse them an interview
but she very wisely decided that if
she told them her version of the
story first she might profit a great
deal by it and if she could enlist
their sympathy there was no telling
how much good they might do her
  the reporters were still at monty-
croft wrhen the two troopers of the
night before together with an offi-
cer arrived they dismissed the re-
porters and then cross-examined
billie for an hour or more most of
the questions she had already been
asked at first she was patient and
helpful but as it became plainer and
plainer that they wrere trying to
make her confess to the murder of
gil she lost all patience
  listen she snapped i tell you
once and for all i didnt do it i
dont know who did it and i dont
much care and how do you like
that anybody with the brains of
a brainless donkey would know 
didnt and at that im probably
insulting the donkey
  she was angry and she expected
them to be angry but they grinned
at her as if it had all been a huge
joke that turned her anger into
exasperation they left soon after-
ward the interview as far as billie
could see having accomplished
nothing
  they were hardly out of the

street  smiths love story magazine
drive when florence drove up she
was a very different person from
the florence who had made that
other visit a lot of her languor was
gone
  listen she said without pre-
liminary len is telling around
down at headquarters that you and
he were engaged to be married as
soon as you could get an annulment
of your marriage hes just pulling
that to get you out of a tight hole
isnt he
  billies anger soothed by the
grins of her trooper tormentors
flared again instantly
  on the contrary hes telling the
truth i doubt if he ever did love
you or was ever engaged to you
you probably bought that ring
yourself
  thats all i wanted to know
florence snapped you two think
you pulled a fast one on me dont
you i suppose he thinks he did
something big in giving me the run-
around well if he doesnt change
his mind right off hell find himself
in plenty of trouble i know a lot
more than you think i do and ill
talk ill get even with him if it
takes the rest of my life
  florence hurried down the steps
slammed the car into gear with a
great deal of noise and shot away
  well billie said to herself
that was certainly short and
sweet id hate to be in lens shoes
of course she cant really clo any-
thing to him
  but billie was wrong within an
hour billie had a telephone call
from trooper barracks telling her
that on information sworn to by
florence lane they had arrested
len to be held for trial by the grand
jury on a charge of murder
  it took billie just four and a half
minutes to reach the forestport jail
after a good deal of delay she was
led into a visiting booth where she
found len facing her in another
booth on the opposite side of a
heavy wire screen she wondered a
little at having been granted an in-
terview with him so easily but she
found out later that every word
they said was heard over a hidden
telephone connection between the
two booths
  len billie said in a choked
voice her eyes bright with moisture
they cant hold you for this they
cant say you did it
  len shrugged resignedly flor-
ence came in and told them plenty
what-what did she tell them
that she was out on the island
and overheard you and me talking
you remember the night we saw the
womans footprints well florence
must have made those
  billie was beginning to compre-
hend
  we talked about your quarrels
with gil and your threatening him
if he didnt leave me alone and his
threatening you when he caught you
kissing me
  and the fact that if we could get
rid of him we could marry she
made it all sound as bad as possible
especially the kissing business and
my threatening him
  but they wont believe her it
will be just her word against yours
len they cant believe it
  well they unfortunately thought
of mrs morley she overheard the
quarrel there at montycroft she
couldnt help it with all the shouting
we did
  but len even that-
  and i wouldnt deny it in fact
i let them believe it was true len
said it saved me the trouble of
confessing
  of-of confessing her eyes
were pitiful horrified
strand of gold

       you two think you pulled a fast one on me don t you well if len
       doesnt marry me hell find himself in plenty of trouble i know a lot
       more than you think i do and ill talk  get even with him if it takes
                                 the rest of my life
   sure they were getting a pretty that they work on me i had just
good case against you i couldnt as much or more of a chance ot
let them take you it was better getting out of it

street  smiths love story magazine
  but len you-you didnt do
it-uncertainly then suddenly
sure i know you didnt do it
len
  his face relaxed its grim lines
and he smiled gratefully
  thanks for the confidence
billie he said with a momentary
return to his old-time manner no
i didnt do it in fact i guess you
must realize by now that until we
found out that our boats had been
tampered with i thought you had
done it yourself
  but len youve got to deny it
otherwise they may find you
guilty
  ill deny it after im sure youre
not being considered and ive got
a lot of confidence that something
will turn up in the meantime
  but billie couldnt feel his con-
fidence always misery had fol-
lowed everything she did len
would be found guilty if he didnt
the road to happiness would lie open
before her but she somehow
couldnt believe that she was des-
tined to travel that road
  as she was passing the office on
the way out a trooper stopped her
and asked her if she would step in-
side for a moment another trooper
sat at the desk a set of ear phones
lying in front of him
  miss preston he said im be-
ginning to be more and more inter-
ested in this matter of the missing
canoes what are your theories
  billie thought it peculiar that he
should have changed his point of at-
tack so suddenly but she had no
idea that the reason for his doing
so lay in that pair of ear phones in
front of him
  i have no idea she said who
could have been out there some-
body who knew that gil would be
there and im sure he kept that
fact fairly secret
  well-the officer nodded pleas-
antly more pleasantly than any of
the troopers had acted toward billie
since the affair had started-well
keep our eyes open and if you
have any ideas let us know
  back at montycroft billie de-
cided one thing she would not give
up this chance at happiness and
since she loved len so much she
would not let them punish him for
a thing he had not done never
somehow she would find a way to
exonerate him she had no idea how
she would do it but somehow she
must
  the popular idea that all beauti-
ful women must of necessity be
dumb is a long way from the truth
like many thousands of others
billie was a living refutation of that
idea bewilderment and despera-
tion gradually wore off and gave
place to quiet organized thought
  billie finally came to two startling
conclusions one was that some-
body might have come out to the
island to kill len and in the dark
killed gil by mistake
  the second was that if mr hol-
land were really in love with flor-
ence he would have had a very good
reason for getting rid of len whom
florence loved
  billie sat bolt upright in her chair
out on the porch her eyes surprised
and staring once started with that
train of reasoning thoughts came
thick and fast
  wthere had she seen mr holland
before in new york obviously or
else she had seen a picture of him
perhaps he was sufficiently disguised
from his real self to fool her yet at
the same time to have that vague
familiarity why was the sight of
him always linked in her mind with
evil there must be some reason
if her feeling that holland was
crooked should prove to be correct
strand of gold

then he might very
easily be the one who
was trying to steal
the treasure away
from len by stick-
ing to the mistaken
identity idea that
would make a double
motive for his kill-
ing gil whom he
thought was len
first to rid himself
of a rival and second to get the
treasure book which florence must
have overheard len say he kept
len billie said in a choked voice her eyes bright with
moisture they cant hold you for this they cant say
you murdered gil robinson i know you didnt do
it len
with him constantly perhaps hol-
land had accompanied florence on
her spying trip to the island or

street  smiths love story magazine
perhaps he had been following her
checking up on her and had over-
heard the same conversation she
had heard billie distinctly remem-
bered the two canoes which had
passed her hiding place one follow-
ing the other
  she rose hastily from her chair
and went out to the car if one
had a hunch the thing to do was
to play it for all it was worth she
drove down to the local photog-
raphers
  theres a gentleman named hol-
land staying over at the inn billie
explained to the proprietor and
weve got to pick up a picture of
him for a scavenger hunt it oc-
curred to me that you might have
a snap either alone or in a group
that you could let me have
  the photographer shook his head
slowly
  id like to oblige you he said
ive been stumped on these scav-
enger hunts myself but im not
sure i can hes only had two rolls
of films developed here and most of
those were pictures of miss lane
  he paused thinking
  i tell you what he said bright-
ening it wouldnt make much dif-
ference whether it was a good or a
bad picture of him would it not
for a scavenger hunt well in that
last roll there were several that
werent good enough to print and
one was of him when he looked
them over he dropped those in the
wastebasket you let me go out
back and i think maybe i can find
them then ill print up one for
you
  billie waited hoping against hope
after all a poor snap would be bet-
ter than none at all
  after a long time the man re-
turned triumphant a smudged light-
struck but recognizable snapshot of
holland in his hands
  there he said that ought to
do the trick and im glad i could
help you
  billie thanked him profusely and
then went to the post office she
sent the picture by special delivery
to a friend of hers who clerked in
the police records bureau in new
york she requested in her accom-
panying message that the identity
of the man be telegraphed to her at
once together with his criminal rec-
ord if any she went home then
to wait very much pleased with her-
self
  the next morning she went again
to see len if anything he was
bluer than he had been the day be-
fore
  boy it seems good to see you
he said this place is giving me
the jitters why do you and i have
to be dragged so deep into this mess
when it wasnt our fault of course
he added loyally i still think its
better for me to be here than for
you
  len billie protested and it
seemed then as if that wire screen-
ing which kept her from taking him
in her arms from comforting him
was the cruelest thing in the world
youve got to stop thinking about
me youve got to think about
yourself and try to plan a way to
get out of this mess ill work as
hard as ever i can to get you out
but youve got to tell them that
youre innocent youve got to
make a big fuss about it
  not till im sure youre safe
he told her doggedly and she knew
it was useless to argue
  listen len she changed the
subject have you still got that
book with you and when he
nodded and will you trust me
with it ive got an idea
  he nodded assent gravely in-
stantly
strand of gold

  when the guard conies ill send
it around to you by him i had the
devils own time getting them to let
me keep it
  they talked a while longer and
then xjillie left promising to come
back that afternoon if she could she
waited until the guard came out to
her with the book and then returned
to montycroft to find a telegram
waiting for her it read
  looks like james norcross
alias smooth jim escaped con-
vict stop was serving life
sentence dannemora for mur-
der stop can you help au-
thorities locate him
  billie waited as patiently as she
could until the time when she could
see len again without exciting any
ones suspicions meantime she
telegraphed her friend in new york
not to do anything until she heard
from her
  immediately after luncheon she
was again ushered into the booth
where len was waiting
  len she said you told me
once that your father was a judge
did a man named norcross ever
come before him james norcross
  len nodded
  sure did dad sent him up for
life for murder and this norcross
swore hed get even there was a
lot about it in the papers at the
time i was personally sort of re-
lieved when they convicted him
why what do you know about
him
  nothing billie assured him
vaguely i was just wondering if
your father was the judge cooper
i had read about who was on the
bench during that trial hows the
food here
  len said a great deal about the
food most of which must have made
the gentleman with the ear phones
very uncomfortable and having
thus successfully changed the sub-
ject billie stayed a while longer
then went back to montycroft as
she rode along she was very
thoughtful pieces of this jig-saw
puzzle seemed to be fitting together
now this made the third and
strongest motive for murder in line
with her theory of mistaken iden-
tity
  she called holland on the phone
immediately
  mr holland she said this is
billie preston ive got a proposi-
tion to make to you which will be
to your advantage as well as mine
could you come out to monty-
croft
  mr holland assured her that he
was always willing even eager to
hear propositions that were to his
advantage and would she have
dinner with him at the inn that
night she would fine
  that night billie was just as care-
ful in dressing as she would have
been if she had been going out with
len she strove for a touch of
worldliness in her appearance which
would fool mr holland
  after they had ordered billie
went directly to the point
  mr holland she said in a voice
pitched so low that there was not
the remotest possibility of its being
overheard we might as wrell under-
stand each other at once to start
with well just pretend that youre
james norcross
  not the slightest flicker of sur-
prise crossed his face he laughed
easily
  of course thats crazy but if it
will please such a grand-looking
girl its  k with me
  now what i want to know is
this are you or arent you inter-
ested in a certain treasure that xen
cooper knows about

street  smiths love story magazine
  well he spoke slowly choosing
his words carefully and his eyes had
become calculating slits of animated
marble well just pretend that i
am what about it
  only this im in a position to
give you the information you need
regarding the whereabouts of that
treasure
  in return for what he leaned
forward a little the only sign he
gave of his excitement
  in return for something big len
and i are both to go free of any
suspicion of guilt in regard to the
murder of gil robinson
  he spread his hands in the patron-
izing gesture of a man who talks to
a child
  and how would i be able to do
that for you
  easily i know that you mur-
dered gil robinson thinking he was
len i know that
  this time the shaft struck home
his face showed no change but his
eyes became harder more cruel if
such a thing were possible
  all right he snapped if you
know so much what are you going
to do about it ive got an air-tight
alibi you cant prove a thing
  i know it-billie nodded im-
perturbably im not going to
try
  he looked at her wondering just
what her game was
  well what is your game any-
way
  ill tell you when you tell me
that you killed gil there arent
any listeners
  all right i knew cooper was
going to meet you and when a guy
came sneaking along the path i let
him have it it was going to even
up a lot of things and get me the
book and then it turned out to
be that other punk i didnt have
anything against him but so help
me if you try to pin it on me i can
prove-
  oh dont be childish im not
going to try to pin anything on you
ive got a proposition to make and
im going to make it you can take
it or leave it and that vviil end the
whole thing
   all right im listening
  well you must realize that
youre standing on dynamite now
that i know who you are you wont
get a chance at the treasure be-
cause youll have to leave town
and if they catch you you go back
to prison for life all right they
wouldnt be after you any harder
for an extra murder than they are
now and always will be and with
the money from that treasure you
could go a long way from this coun-
try
  he leaned forward again sud-
denly intent
  are you suggesting that youll
give me the book if ill confess rob-
insons murder
  exactly billie nodded grimly
thats the proposition if you do
it nobody finds out that youre
james norcross and you get a
good start before i spring the writ-
ten confession youre going to give
me
  she watched him anxiously as he
slumped back in his chair thinking
so much depended on this for her
for the man she loved that she had
all she could do to keep from yelling
out anything to break the tension
he roused himself just once
  how do i know you can deliver
the book
  youve got to take my word for
it that book is hidden where
youll never find it ill give it to
you when i get your confession
again he slumped back into the
chair silent and after a long
while he sat up his lips set he
ls-a
strand of gold

stretched a hand across the table
and so great was billies relief that
she laughed hysterically
o k baby youre on he said
chapter ix
  when billie met holland the next
morning she was nervous and wor-
ried she knew exactly what she
was going to do but knowing what
you are going to do and doing it
are two different things especially
when a mission is as dangerous as
the one on which she was embark-
ing
  you got that book he de-
manded immediately he had two
men with him as well as a diving
crew and a large motor boat
  no billie told him calmly i
went out to the island and hid that
book yesterday evening and i
wont tell you where till i have what
youre going to give me right in my
hands
  so you dont trust me he
asked with the first grin she had ever
seen on his face
  not any farther than i could
throw this boat billie grinned in
return she knew that they under-
stood each other
  they rode out to the island in
the boat and billie examined the
diving equipment the air motor
and the auxiliary hand motor in case
there should be engine trouble while
the diver was below she tried to
lift the massive helmet and the
lead-weighted shoes the diver ex-
plained to billie the air-control
valve inside his helmet which he
worked with his head with it he
could let the air out of his suit and
stay down or let the suit fill with
air and come to the surface if any-
thing happened to him he would
automatically come to the surface
because with no pressure on the
 ls-a
valve the suit would fill with air
he let her feel the wrist bands of
the suit so tight they almost cut off
the circulation the boat and div-
ing equipment she found were his
whether he thought he was em-
barked on a legitimate enterprise or
not she had no way of knowing
  when they reached the wharf and
landed holland drew billie to one
side
  now he said wheres that
book
  now billie mimicked him
wheres that paper
  with rather poor grace he drew
a folded sheet of paper from his
pocket and handed it to billie
  see if that suits you he
snapped
  billie read it through and then
put it into her bag
  thats all right come with me
  she walked down to the boat-
house and took the book from under
a loose board holland grabbed it
from her
  didnt mother ever teach you
not to grab billie demanded
where are your manners any-
way you cant do anything till i
tell you which page to look on it
says that that particular ship sank
about one hundred feet due north
of the end of whale-back island
nearest the mainland read it for
yourself its on page ninety-four
  holland flipped the pages reached
the page he was looking for and
then read rapidly billie watched
him so much treasure was a high
price to pay for lens freedom and
for her own but she may have real-
ized that if she gained love no price
was too great at any rate she
did not seem too terribly disap-
pointed
  now holland said with a satis-
fied smile when he had finished read-
ing were getting somewhere
-
street  smiths love story magazine
i know that you murdered gil robinson thinking he was len in
return for your confession ill give you the book containing the informa-
tion of the sunken treasure and time to make a get-away before
spring the written confession
strand of gold

  and now billie told him ill
be starting back for the mainland
an instant change came over
him
  listen baby he leered youre
staying right here see you aint
going to any mainland with any
dynamite like the paper you got
there i aint trusting you to hold
off showing it till i get the dough
and get out of here youre stay-
ing right here on this island ill
have one of the boys watch you
billie had to agree to that be-
cause there was no other course
open she had been afraid of it
and she had planned for just such
an emergency

street  smiths love story magazine
  because she knew knew as well
as she knew her own name that
holland would not find any treas-
ure
  for a while billie watched the
diving operations from a bench up
among the trees one of hollands
own men had been left behind to
keep an eye on her but she did
not show any inclination to move
and gradually he wandered farther
and farther away caught by the ex-
citement of looking for the gold
billie watched him carefully waiting
her chance
  after a while holland called from
the boat and the man on shore went
in search of a large block of wood
billie quietly slipped away from the
bench strolled along until she was
sure she was out of sight and then
ran for the house
  when holland did not find any
treasure he would be after her she
knew and his signed confession
meant too much to her to lose it
of course she could hide the paper
but she had no illusions about the
good that would do her if she her-
self was still within hollands reach
he would make her give it back
torture her until she told him where
it was hidden she dared not start
for shore because the boats were all
in plain sight of the anchored div-
ing boat shed have to hide
  but that was easier said than
done she had thought about it a
long time before she had decided
on a place even then it was a
toss-up whether or not she would be
found
  she knew that first of all they
would search the house so that she
did not plan to stay there yet she
went there first let herself in and
ran down into the cellar she hid
the precious paper in one of the
furnace pipes and then went out the
back door she looked around care-
fully to be sure that no one was
watching and then started toward
the water tower there was a metal
ladder at one corner of the frame-
work which held the huge tank and
she climbed this cautiously the
tank loomed high above her its
water was supplied from the lake by
a windmill and it was of course
maintained to furnish pressure for
the house before she was high
enough in the air to see the diving
ship at the end of the island she
had reached the protection of the
tank itself and was crawling up its
side
  when she reached the top she lay
there for several minutes then she
took off the trap-door cover and
looked inside the tank was full
just as she had expected and she
nodded grimly to herself she lay
there and waited taking care that
only one eye and part of her cheek
should be visible from the path be-
low
  she waited hours at last she
caught a glimpse of something mov-
ing along the path the figure of a
man running two more men
  she slid carefully through the
trap-door into the cold water of the
tank it was dark-pitch-dark
she swam over to the far side and
grabbed the ends of the bolts which
held the ladder in place the cold
of the water was worse than it would
have been if she had been swim-
ming because she was not moving
around
  she could hear the men shouting
to each other near the house look-
ing for her she heard doors slam
and knew that the house was being
turned inside out
  at last they gave that up and
began to search the island they
went about the task systematically
and she was glad she had not chosen
strand of gold

to sit in a tree as she had at first
planned still a tree wouldnt make
you so cold that your teeth chat-
tered so cold it seemed as if you
couldnt stand it the cold ate at
her heart breaking down her reso-
lution making her want to climb
out where the sun could warm her
the consequences of being caught
by holland seemed very remote to
her then and the cold seemed very
real for herself she might have
given in but she was working for
len for len and their happiness
  she gritted her teeth and stayed
where she was not moving hardly
daring to breathe shortly she
heard voices again closer and
louder she realized that the
owners of the voices were standing
directly underneath the tower
  i tell you shes gone ashore
one voice urged and we aint safe
here a minute
  and i tell you she hasnt hol-
lands voice answered impatiently
shes hiding on this island and
weve got to find her we havent
looked up on that tower she might
be there climb up and see
  billies heart sank she could feel
the vibration through the ladder
bolts as the man started to climb
well this was the end might as
well make the best of it and be a
good loser she had staked every-
thing on their not thinking of the
water tower and now she had lost
  the man climbed higher and
higher until she could sense that he
was directly outside the place where
she herself was hanging on he
looked over the top and then called
down to holland his voice hollow
and deafening inside the tank
nobody up on top here
  look inside holland com-
manded
  billie played her last card as she
heard the man scrambling forward
she took several deep breaths in
quick succession and then quietly
sank below the surface held herself
down there by bolt ends farther un-
der water
  all she could do was hold on un-
til her breath gave out at first
it wasnt hard but gradually it be-
came horrible her lungs began to
ache a splitting awful ache yet
she held on grimly at least it took
her mind off the cold water
 her head began to ache next
worse than it had ever ached before
yet she held on and when the pain
began to bring unbearable fiery
darts before her eyes she let her
breath out gradually panic over-
took her for a few moments longer
she fought it and then she came to
the surface sucked in a great gulp
of air breathed again and again
her head still ached and her body
was weak she had no control over
it
  there was no shout of triumph as
she had half expected and when
she could see she realized that there
was no mans figure in the trap-
door opening looking in at her she
had not been seen then because
she was so weak and the effort had
been so great because relief had
flooded her at last she began to
sob
  she fought the cold and stayed
there as long as she could even
after there were no more sounds be-
low her then she came out and
lay in the sun and after a long time
her shivering stopped her clothes
dried far off toward shore she
could see the diving boat but she
dared not take any chances one
of hollands men might have stayed
behind in hiding
  she remained up on the tower un-
til dark then went to the furnace
for the paper after that she

street  smiths love story magazine
walked silently down to the beach
she waited a long time before she
dared run across the sand in the
open shove off a canoe and start
for the mainland
  but no one followed her and
an hour later she walked into the
office at the jail threw the paper
onto the desk and stood there while
the man glanced through it
  that long she held her poise and
no longer she had been through
too much she sobbed a little try-
ing hard not to and she felt a great
relief in being where it was light
darkness was horribly unnerving
a few moments later len came in
his kindly face full of love for her
his eyes shining and a second later
she was in his arms those strong
protecting arms which had the
power to shut away from her all
the evil and unhappiness in the
world
  honey he said at last tell me
about it i want to know if hes
tried-
  come on and sit down she said
and ill tell you but please dont
take your arm from around me
len t-i guess i need it
  so his arm around her she told
him and when she
had finished he said
  you did exactly
right sweet the
treasure wouldnt
have mattered if we
had been somehow
kept apart our be-
ing together is the
only thing that mat-
ters and youre
especially right now
that we know there
was no treasure
  but there was-
there is billie told
him and her eyes
danced
  but billie you said holland
didnt find-
  and he didnt he was figuring
just the way youre figuring the
end of whale-back island nearest
the mainland and he didnt know
and you never stopped to think
that the two islands were joined be-
fore the government dredged be-
tween them and that the whole
thing was called whale-back there
wasnt any diamond island then
his eyes were startled as he be-
gan to realize what she meant
  so the end of the old whale-back
island nearest the mainland he
said would be what is now the
shoreward end of diamond island
the opposite end of the two islands
from where holland looked
exactly billie murmured and
i knew they wouldnt find anything
where they were looking and
thats why i hid and thats why
i dared make the offer to him in
the first place
  joyfully he drew her to him
say he said just before he
kissed her i not only have the
swellest-looking girl in forty-eight
states but shes got more brains
than any three men
  forty-eight states
and the district of
columbia billie
grinned up at him
  and the district
of columbia he as-
sured her two dis-
tricts both of co-
lumbia
  a week later billie
and len stood arm
in arm at the shore-
ward end of dia-
mond island watch-
ing the same diving
boat which holland
had hired bringing
strand of gold

honey len said im glad were rich but the thing that matters
is that we have each other-and love and that means everything billie 
over the side a heavy iron chest	much was to be theirs into what
rusted out at one end but with most	luxury they were graduating there
of its precious contents recoverable	would be no want for them now
it awed them a little to think how	everything in the world they could

street  smiths love story magazine
think of they could afford len ex-
pressed the thought which was there
between them
  honey he said im glad were
rich but the thing that matters is
that we have each other-and love
and all that means it means
everything billie it means happi-
ness whether youre rich or poor
and riches mean unhappiness with-
out love
  i know billie answered softly
lots and lots of times i stop and
tell myself that all the misery i had
before is being made up to me now
now that i have you the happiness
is supreme i dont think half so
much about the things our treasure
will buy as i think about our life
together
  his arms stole around her and he
kissed her rapturously
  and we owe it to you he said
huskily because you were brave
and clever im glad they caught
holland i would have been nerv-
ous if he had still been at large
for a long time they stood watch-
ing the work going on before them
and in their hearts was the beauty
of their surroundings and the won-
der of then love it seemed to
billie as if her misery were far in
the past so great was her happiness
now
  len kissed her again and held her
close and forgotten was the wealth
that was so soon to be theirs finally
billie said almost reverently
  i love you len and my vaca-
tion sweetheart is going to be my
full-time all-day all-through-my-
life sweetheart from now on-for
always
the end
  my beautiful dream
   tkougii all my dreams are luring
       and evermore strangely fair
    like the petals of fragrant roses
    that drift on the summer air
    whenever i meet you darling
    as dusk walks the ghostly dew
    my tremulous heart discovers
    my beautiful dream is you
    dear lass when we keep our trysting
    and cling by the lilac tree
    as you and your yielding kisses
    are saying you love but me
    the earth is a mystic heaven
     where all of my dreams come true
    because my glad heart is knowing
    my beautiful dream is you

her great moment
by floria howe bruess
  its either mistaken identity or
an attempt at a pick-up esther
thought swiftly but he looks sin-
cere and glad to see-sylvia
esther was lonely it was sun-
day there was nothing to do she
did not care to go to a concert or
show alone she had gone for a
walk in the park had become tired
and had sat down on a bench
sylvia a voice called in joy-
ous surprise esther dorn
sitting on a bench in the park
looked at the young man who was
apparently hailing her as she
stared his chauffeur brought the
car to a stop and the young man
sprang out and crossed the road to
the girl his face was eager his
eyes alight

street  smiths love story magazine
  jack deering stood beside her
hand extended smiling a warm
quick smile
  when did you get back sylvia
i passed your home a few minutes
ago and its still boarded up your
last letter said you wouldnt be writ-
ing me again as you expected to sail
very soon and here you are you
must have left your parents in
europe never mind i wont ask
questions
  esther looked at him intently he
really believed she was sylvia-
whoever sylvia was it would be
fun to carry this along for a while
he would discover his mistake soon
and they would laugh it off
  cant a girl change her mind
she asked lightly
  especially you he agreed smil-
ingly youre the most changeable
person on earth youve even
changed your voice since youve
been gone but i like that lower
note keep it he laughed softly
and seated himself beside her
  it seems funny to see you in the
park alone what are you doing
looking at you esther replied
impishly
  what a nice laugh he had and
how good-looking he was with his
wavy blond hair blue eyes and tall
slim figure
  so far he hadnt discovered his
mistake there must be an ex-
traordinary resemblance between
her and sylvia esther mused she
had heard of such resemblances-
doubles but this was her first ex-
perience
  staying with a friend sylvia
yes you dont know her that
much was true esther thought for
he would not know kitty
  kitty taught drawing in the girls
private school where esther taught
piano kitty had gone home over
the week-end else esther would not
have been so lonely kitty would
be back late that evening however
for the next day was monday
  and you returned alone youve
got something up your sleeve but
i am glad to see you ive missed
you terribly
  esther wondered who he was
everything about him looked ex-
pensive-that big car a liveried
chauffeur the thin platinum watch
he wore on his wrist his smartly
fitting clothes
  you arent set for the afternoon
are you lets go some place we
could drive to long island the
jamesons are back and theres al-
ways something doing there
  id rather not esther replied
quickly i feel lazy thats why
i was sitting here soaking up the
sunshine
  she lifted sparkling dark eyes
and smiled at him where were
you going you were on your way
she glanced at his car parked across
the road
  ive forgotten where i was go-
ing he said looking at her keenly
he reached into an inside pocket
look at this and laugh sylvia
ive been carrying your last letter in
my left pocket where it would hear
my heart beat
  he extended an envelope swiftly
esther read his name and address
this was getting good-she knew
his name now her eyes danced and
she laughed
go ahead i knew youd laugh
he replaced the letter in his pocket
oh i didnt laugh because of
that i think that was sweet-
she stopped abruptly wrould syl-
via have said that
  thats the nicest thing ive
heard you say look here sylvia
be nice to me and give me the
afternoon and evening lets step
high wide and handsome
her great moment

  what would you suggest she
asked curiously
  lie glanced at his watch its
three thirty lets drop in on dad
for cocktails then well-
  esther shook her head no drop-
ping in on anybody to-day and
im going back to-kittys the
wind is getting cold she rose and
held out her hand she had better
put an end to this before she got
into deep water
  what a no girl you are youd
stun me if you said yes but im
driving you to where youre stay-
ing and im calling for you to-
night at eight and were dining
he persisted
  well there was no reason why he
shouldnt drive her home it was
a nice apartment house she lived in
it would be pleasant driving in that
beautiful car she wouldnt talk
much mustnt let the cat out of
the bag
  he took her arm and they crossed
the road the chauffeur touched his
cap to esther as he opened the car
door
  how do you do miss wylie he
said
  esther smiled he too thought
she was sylvia whose last name ap-
parently was wylie sylvia must
have driven often with jack esther
felt a little twinge of envy
  she gave jack the address and
leaned back luxuriously as the big
car purred through the park
  jack talked about his summer in
canada esther gathered that he
was in business with his father ex-
porters all too soon they arrived
at her apartment
  ill call at eight jack said
eagerly
  about to refuse a swift reckless-
ness swept away esthers caution
why not go kitty would not be
back until ten or eleven it would
be such a long lonely evening
  jack was so obviously a gentle-
man and with his sense of humor
he would laugh consider it a rich
joke when later on she would tell
him
  jack crossed to the vestibule with
esther and looked at the cards over
the letter boxes
  ring apartment d to-night
she said gayly ill be ready at
eight
  youre a darling he smiled his
quick warm smile
  katherine burrows he read
thats kitty i suppose who is
esther dorn
  a friend of kittys she said
quickly good-by jack
  no chance for me to come up
now and mix a cocktail he held
her hand and bent his deep-blue
eyes upon her -
not a chance ivitty doesnt
keep the makings neither does
esther
   nice little girls he laughed
what a dear boy he was esther
sighed as she stepped into her apart-
ment and closed the door behind
her sylvia was a lucky girl she
had jack and a mother and father
and was in europe that meant
money background she was not
alone in the world as esther was
she was not dependent on her own
efforts to make a living
  oh well esthers brown silky
head went up and the dark-brown
eyes sparkled she was in for ad-
venture it wasnt every girl who
could have a lark like this mis-
taken for another girl-wouldnt
kitty howl
  id better see where sylvia
lives esther flipped over the
pages of the telephone book wylie
too many of them shed have to
be careful about that to-night she
street  smiths love story magazine
turned to deering here it was
john deering  son exporters
the residence was on park avenue
that was the address on the enve-
lope she had seen
  to-night will be my one great
moment im glad i had a wave
and manicure yesterday esther
sang under her breath as she laid
out her new dinner dress i must
be careful and not talk out of turn
  long before eight oclock she was
dressed a flame of excitement
blazed in her dark eyes her head
rose like a flower from the silvery
gown that clung like mist to the slim
roundness of her figure her slip-
pers were the blue of the antique
turquoise necklace she wore a
necklace her grandmother had worn
and esthers one piece of valuable
jewelry
  her heart beat furiously when the
bell rang she pressed the buzzer
to release the outside door
  this is like stage fright she
thought as she stood in the door
awaiting him
  jacks eyes that held the blue of
ice and the blue of fire lingered on
her as he approached the doorway
how exquisite she was hair like
soft-brown threads of silk eyes the
deep-brown of pansies her skin
was like satin her lips like rose
petals
  he drew a deep unsteady breath
ive never seen you look so beauti-
ful sylvia he stepped into the
living room
  ready in a minute jack her
voice was a trifle unsteady also
  this is a charming room he
said wrhen she reappeared with wrap
gloves and evening bag arent
you going to let me meet your
friends id like to know kitty and
esther they have good taste i
like those etchings and that clock
it looks like a terry
  esther was about to say it is
it belonged to my grandmother
but she caught herself in time
  i say arent those ilepplewhite
chairs
  yes they belonged to esthers
grandmother when esther came to
new york she brought the things
she liked best with her her grand-
mother raised her and when she
passed on esther secured a post
here she teaches piano
  that accounts for that grand
id like to meet esther she showed
extraordinary good taste in arrang-
ing her antiques
  im ready jack esther said
anxious to terminate the conversa-
tion
  youll slay em to-night sylvia
he said holding the door open for
her as she passed him he bent his
head and kissed the brown silky
hair
  dont jack she said faintly
  thats the weakest dont i ever
heard from you my dear he
laughed softly
  it was with trepidation esther en-
tered the big brilliant dining room
in the towering hotel if some one
who knew sylvia should see her-
it was a risk but it was worth it
to spend one enchanted evening with
jack
  ill tell him to-night on the way
home esther promised herself not
realizing then that promises are
often gossamer frail easily broken
  she sipped her cocktail eyes on
his
  beautiful eyes sylvia to-night
there are little golden lights in
them
  perhaps its the table light it
has a yellow shade
  has it i havent time to look
his eyes held her own as though
helplessly he was drowning in them
her great moment

she too seemed as helpless to look
away the waiter finally broke the
spell
  dance jack queried after they
had finished their entree
  esther rose at once glad to escape
from the eyes whose blue fire was
burning into her heart racing
through her veins
  the feel of his arm around her
left her breathless the clasp of his
big firm hand on hers sent little
thrills like pointed darts coursing
through her they danced in almost
complete silence esthers eyes
were brilliant reckless when they
returned to their table
  sylvia i feel somehow that you
like me better to-night than you
ever have am i right he
leaned forward eager expectant
  something that was young and ar-
dent and devastatingly alive and
that had no connection whatever
with caution and common sense
beat in her veins
  again the waiter intervened as he
placed the consomme before them
  darned waiters jack growled
theyre never around when you
want them but theyre always on
hand to spoil a perfect moment
  what a gay dinner companion
he is she thought as she sipped the
wine a delicate chateau margaux
her fingers were white delicate as
lily petals jacks eyes were upon
them she hoped he did not ob-
serve they were unsteady
  over the alligator pear-and-
romaine salad with its mignonette
dressing esther thought
  soon the clock will strike twelve
for me and this will be over i
must not see him again in fact he
wont want to see me when he learns
that im not sylvia
  she raised stricken eyes to jack
then quickly lowered her lashes
they made alluring little shadows
on her soft round cheeks jack was
watching them
  with the dessert esther knew she
was head over heels in love
  its too early to say amen to
the evening jack said when they
had dined lets drive out to a
place i know he urged youve
never been there i believe they
put on a swell floor show and its
a glorious night-moonlight star-
light everything turned on
  ill call kitty and tell her ill be
late esther murmured
  in a phone booth she dialed the
number
  i may be late kitty she said
when the familiar voice came over
the wire im stepping to-night
who ill tell you about it later
listen have you ever heard of syl-
via wylie
  wait a minute ill think that
name is familiar kitty replied
slowly
  kitty was an information bureau
esther reflected while she waited
born in new york an enthusiastic
reader of the society pages she had
names gossip even bits of scandal
at her finger tips
  i remember now shes that
girl thats a dead ringer for you
remember i told you when i first
met you at the school ive seen
her picture in the papers and shes
been pointed out to me several
times why esther
 esther had forgotten about
kittys remark of three months be-
fore when she had first come to new
york
  is she a society girl wealthy
and is she reported engaged to any
one
  yes to all your questions shes
a last years deb shes been re-
ported engaged a dozen times once
to some english lord but it fell
through i guess she cant stay put
street  smiths love story magazine
they say shes spoiled and head-
strong
  did you ever hear of john or
jack deering
  sure father and son theyre
in business together exporters
nice people but not society though
the young fellow goes out a bit ive
seen his name in society columns
for the love of pete why all the
questions
  ill tell you when i come in
thanks a lot kit esther hung
up
  sylvia was spoiled changeable
jack was in love with her sylvia
had been flirting with him-she was
not serious but he was it all added
up well esther was not hurting
sylvia by taking this precious eve-
ning no one would be hurt except
herself-but it was worth it
  on the drive home she would tell
him she rehearsed the words
jack get set for a big laugh im
esther not sylvia ive been play-
ing a game- she could go no
further it was no longer funny it
was cruel put it out of your
mind she told herself fiercely be
happy while you may
 love this was love she had
often wondered if love would come
to her and now how strangely it
had come
  jack was very gay and seemed to
be happy esther forced the shad-
ows from her heart and fell in with
his mood
  finally they left the highway and
turned into a narrow road music
floated out to them on the cold night
air lights in a long low building
twinkled and beckoned cars were
parked  the side of the building
their tail lights shining like red
eyes
  the night club was filled to capac-
ity brilliant with lights sparkling
jewels and the sheen of velvet
gowns
  esther thought they were going
to a quiet place but this was bril-
liant smart if any of sylvias
friends are here- ill just have
to take it esther told herself but
it wouldnt be fun if one of sylvias
friends-who had known sylvia so
much longer than jack had and
therefore would be able to see be-
yond the striking resemblance-
should upset the apple cart esther
herself wanted to tell jack she did
not want another to tell him
  but good fortune often favors the
bold esther told herself and head
up shoulders back she walked down
an aisle to the ringside table jack
secured
  they spent a gay hour there an
hour heady with happiness for
esther everything seemed a little
unreal she felt like a leaf swept
away on a stream of joy she had
never dreamed of
  jack looking at her eyes ardent
dancing with jack the hard beat
of his heart so near her own then
the drive back a late moon silvering
everything lending beauty to the
drabbest object
  twice she started to tell him but
every beat of her heart protested
against shattering the magic that in-
closed her
  then they reached her apartment
the revelation stillborn on her lips
  to-morrow night-to-night it
was now he was taking her to a
show she would have one more
evening then
  let me wear your black velvet
to-night will you kitty
 are you going out with jack
deering again thats five nights
in succession esther youre riding
for a fall he wants to marry
sylvia perhaps hes in love with
her great moment

everything seemed a little unreal to esther jack looking at her eyes
ardent dancing with jack the hard beat of his heart so near her own
her or perhaps its her social posi-
tion he wants to sit pretty in her
set hes probably ambitious and
even though you could be her twin
sister youre a poor girl with no
social background so write your
own answer
  i know im going to tell him
to-night esthers eyes were sud-
denly tragic
well he certainly has knocked
you for a loop youre crazy about
him arent you
dont talk about it i-
esther turned swiftly from her
friends searching eyes

street  smiths love story magazine
  better get dressed kid kitty
said softly wear my velvet and
my new wrap the white fox collar
will look lovely on you
  half an hour later the downstairs
bell rang esther sprang up to press
the buzzer kitty dont call me
esther she pleaded softly as she
went to the door dont give me
away there was a frantic note in
her voice
  kitty looked at her pity in her
eyes slowly the pity turned to
laughter
  you can say im dressing if i
dont meet him i cant be a party
to the second part or whatever it
is kitty closed the bedroom door
as the doorbell sounded
 jack brought gardenias he
placed the box on a table then
caught esthers hands in his slowly
she drew them away she was
breathless and frightened at the
shining light in his eyes
  while she arranged the fragrant
flowers on her shoulder jack picked
up a beautifully framed photograph
of a white-haired woman
  this is a distinguished-looking
old lady who is she sylvia
why she-shes esthers grand-
mother
  so good blood there
suddenly esthers heart stood
still for kitty was opening the bed-
room door and strolling into the
room
  jack this is kitty i mean-mr
deering miss burrows- esther
stopped confused face hot what
was kitty up to-she wondered
why had she come in
  ive heard a lot about kitty
jack smiled his swift winning smile
as he held out his hand
  it seems to me ive heard a word
or two about you kitty laughed
  im ready jack esther turned
to the door anxious to be safely
out
  good night sylvia kitty said
eyes wide and innocent
  they had driven only a short dis-
tance when jack turned to esther
and caught her hand darling you
know i love you that im mad
about you and you care for me
you cant deny it ive seen it in
a hundred little ways this past
week lets drive out to greenwich
and get married now to-night
  esthers heart pounded in her
throat she couldnt speak jack
caught her hand again held it hard
and fast
  sylvia he said voice tense
  the name roused esther quickly
she drew away her hand
  jack im not sylvia she
blurted out im esther it was
all a joke i didnt intend to keep
it up so long at first it was only
a lark-
  at last jack cried ive been
waiting for you to tell me to-night
i forced your hand i couldnt wait
any longer you little humbug i
knew you werent sylvia after i had
talked to you two minutes that day
in the park twro people may be
alike as peas in a pod but theyll
have different voices different man-
nerisms i didnt know whether
you wrcre kitty or esther until to-
night but ive known all along that
you werent sylvia and i love you
esther
  jack all her passionate long-
ing all the aching tenderness of her
love was in that exclamation
  why didnt you tell me days ago
darling jack asked reproachful
tenderness in his voice
  i thought you loved sylvia and
--oh i intended to tell you to-night
on the way home truly i did but
ls-a
her great moment

it was so hard i thought id never
see you again after you knew-
  but no more words were neces-
sary for she was in his arms lips
pressed against his in a wild sweet
kiss that was a throbbing song of
ecstasy after a time jack said
softly
  sylvia was only a crush darling
but you are love my one and only
ive loved you from the first night
we went out together ill always
adore you my darling-forever and
ever
  the chauffeur had turned the car
into the park and in the sheltering
darkness of the tree-lined road their
lips met and clung in a tender pas-
sionate kiss that fused their hearts
together for all time
 you
  v ou were born for summer days
  and flower-cup perfume
               and all the green of april
               and all the gold of june
  you were meant for dancing
  every sunlit meadow through
              where thrushes spin their melodies
              beneath a tent of blue
  and i was born to follow you
  to grant your smallest need
  to keep your garden flower-filled
  and free from stone and weed
              to walk in joy beside you
              and to tell you all the day
              that my love is deep as heaven is
              and cannot go away
              that ever here beside you
              my heart is waiting lest
              you tire of the dancing-
  and come home to me and rest

office scandal
                   by marie mcgookey
the office was buzzing with
talk when jill came in and
she wondered why every one
stopped the moment they saw her
that is every one except myra
myra had her back to the door and
in the sudden silence her voice
sounded shrill
  its good-by to little jill now
myra was saying maliciously i
wonder how shell feel turning her
job back to lisa bennett jill is
out of luck all right no more
lunches with the junior partner-
  some one nudged myra and she
stopped suddenly jill slipped be-
office scandal

hind her desk she was glad to sit
down her knees were weak
  lisa bennett jill hadnt wanted
to remember lisa these last two
months at first she used to think
a few more weeks and lisa would
be back she told herself that
when she began to notice how big
and handsome and kind bruce car-
roll was
  jill hadnt wanted to fall in love
with bruce she had tried not to
but trying didnt do any good
bruce had only to look at her to
make her heart leap crazily and
he looked at her frequently per-
haps the sight of jills smooth au-
burn hair and deep-blue eyes did
something to his heart also
  anyway there had been those
lunches myra had commented upon
and more-much more rides in
bruces big car and dinners at quiet
restaurants and dancing together
breathless exquisite moments in his
arms while the music wove a magic
spell for them both until jill had
forgotten that she was only a sub-
stitute for lisa and then last
night-
  bruces buzzer was sounding he
wanted her jill gathered up her
notebook and pencil she felt as
though her heart were tied into a
tight little knot but she lifted her
chin defiantly as she opened bruces
door last night was over and this
morning- this morning lisa
was back
  bruce grinned boyishly as he
stood up
 good news honey lisa is
back
  he actually said it jill stiffened
but be didnt seem to notice
  that lets you out jill you
wont have to slave for me any
longer
  slave for you jill bit her
tongue she had almost said i
love to and she would rather die
than say that
  bruces arms went around her
  remember what we talked about
last night we wont have to wait
now we can be married right
away in spite of herself jill
trembled she couldnt hold herself
stiff when bruce was crushing her
close-so close that she could feel
the uneven beating of his heart
lisa can take your place here im-
mediately you wont have to break
in a new girl she called up the first
thing this morning and said shes
ready to go to work
  that was more than jill could
stand she pushed him brusquely
away
  of course she is and im ready
to quit but ill never marry you
bruce carroll never
  you dont mean that jill
bruce said amazed
  i do do you think i havent
heard the stories about you and lisa
that are going the rounds of the
office i tried not to believe them
i thought she wasnt coming back
  just what sort of stories his
voice was stern
  jill drew a deep breath
  about you-and lisa about
working after hours here in your
office they say you used to have
dinner sent in and you had a radio
installed and instead of working
- she gulped but kept on
steadily she listened to her voice
and couldnt believe it was her own
she couldnt believe she was saying
these things to bruce-all the gos-
sip she had hated even to think
about
  bruce didnt deny anything he
simply looked at jill
  you think id do that he asked
softly
  how can i help thinking it-
now she demanded furiously

street  smiths love story magazine
youre glad to have lisa back
youre glad to be rid of me
  you know why i want you to
leave-so that we can be married
and you really expect me to
marry you with lisa here in the
office that would be a swell ar-
rangement jill was so angry she
could have cried but her pride
wouldnt let her as long as lisa
was-she paused before she could
say it-well your past i didnt say
a word but im not going to marry
any man who insists on bringing his
past along with him into the fu-
ture
  bruce laughed aloud at that
stop laughing theres nothing
to laugh at but he didnt stop
and jill clenched her small fists des-
perately how would you like it
if i brought my past home some
night and introduced him to you
would you laugh then
  jill didntreally mean to say that
she only wanted to make bruce stop
laughing and she did so sud-
denly that it scared her
  your past now youre talking
nonsense he sounded angry
  perhaps jill was shivering in-
side you dont think youre the
only one who ever loved any one
else do you
  listen all at once bruce
seemed to tower above jill she
could almost feel herself shrinking
pasts dont bother me in the least
you love me now thats all i want
to know
  i dont love you she tried to
make it sound true i was mis-
taken last night it was-it was
just the moonlight-and every-
thing
  bruce grasped her shoulders
i wasnt mistaken and i dont
believe you were either i love you
and you love me youre jealous
im not jill twisted from his
grasp and started toward the door
im going right now you can keep
your lisa she gasped tearfully
and i hope she makes a better sec-
retary than i did
 the phone rang and bruce
reached for it mechanically
  theres no use trying to talk
here im coming to see you to-
night and ill make you change your
mind
  jill paused with her hand on the
knob
  theres no use talking because
i wont listen and you neednt
come to-night i dont want to hear
any explanations
  bruce acted as though he hadnt
heard ill come he said quietly
to-night because i know you love
me
  for answer jill slammed the door
  i dont love him she whispered
as she ran through the outer office
i dont she repeated defiantly as
she jammed on her hat she didnt
even look at herself in the mirror
or wait to powder her nose
  all the way down in the elevator
jill was glad she was angry and
she would have to stay angry so
that to-night when bruce came she
would be able to send him away
she mustnt be foolish or weak she
mustnt remember bruces kisses or
last night or anything
  jill stumbled as she stepped into
the street but no one paid any at-
tention how could any of those
people know that she had left her
heart in bruce carrolls office and
that hearts cant be taken back sim-
ply by saying i hate you
  jills mind was still whirling with
thoughts of bruce and lisa when
she started across the street one
car skidded around her and another
driver swore softly as his front
wheels went over the curb but the
third didnt have room to turn he
office scandal
c 
lady the driver was helping her to her feet thats no way to
cross the street unless you want to commit suicide jill glanced at
him and saw that he was young and hi cud and good-looking
veiled and jammed the brakes and	feet thats no way to cross the
jill went down in a little heap	street unless you want to commit
  lady the driver was beside	suicide and in that case its not
her in an instant helping her to her	fair to make me an accessory

street  smiths love story magazine
  jill glanced at him and saw that
he was young and blond and good-
looking
  im sorry she murmured shak-
ily it was all my fault
  a curious crowd was gathering
and the man took a firmer hold of
jills arm
  lets get in the car he urged
before were arrested for obstruct-
ing traffic
  you can move on jill didnt
exactly know whether she wanted to
go with him or not im not keep-
ing you
  but he wouldnt take no for
an answer and the next moment
she found herself in the car beside
him
  do you think im cold-blooded
enough to drive away and leave you
here he asked her reproachfully as
he started the engine im no hit-
and-run driver not when i run
down any one as pretty as you
dont be silly jill said a trifle
impatiently im not hurt-really
im not i was just going home
theres no need of you-
  the young man grinned
  then home well go after all
i did bump into you and the least
i can do is see that you get home
safely
  after a moments hesitation jill
gave him her address and leaned
back she was still a bit wabbly
then she thought about bruce and
sat up straight again
  im awfully sorry this hap-
pened the young man was saying
if theres anything i can do for
you just tell me
  perhaps it was that the accident
that made jill light-headed any-
way she took one look at the man
beside her and spoke very fast
  there is something you can do
to-night she drew a deep breath
like a diver about to take a plunge
you can come to my apartment
and pretend that youre my past
  after that she had to explain
not everything just enough so
that the young man wouldnt think
she was crazy at the end he
glanced appraisingly at jill and
laughed
  im to be an ex-sweetheart resur-
rected for the evening i get the
idea its a good one if it will give
me a chance to know you better
  dont count too much on that
jill flashed him a smile its a
past i want not a present or a fu-
ture
  ive a bad memory and ill be
so good that after youve given the
boy friend the air youll get the past
all mixed up with the future
  they stopped in front of the
house where jill had a tiny one-room
apartment
  how about having dinner with
me he leaned forward eagerly
theres lots we ought to talk
about
  i couldnt jill drew back
hastily but you can come early
to-night i want you to be there
when bruce-she stumbled a little
over the name-arrives
  wait a minute yrou havent
told me your name im hilary
borden harry to an old sweet-
heart
  jill didnt quite like the way he
said it
   im jill xainsley she spoke hast-
ily good-by ill expect you
about eight
  jill was trembling with excite-
ment as she closed the door of her
apartment she must have been
crazy to think up a stunt like this
but crazy or not she couldnt back
out and she didnt want to shed
show bruce carroll if he could go
back to lisa she could have some
one else too
office scandal

  he couldnt put his arms around
her couldnt kiss her and make her
change her mind-not with a good-
looking ex-sweetheart in the room
pasts didnt bother him thats
what bruce had said well-jill
tossed her head scornfully-she
hoped this one would-plenty
  she ought to fall in love with
harry borden just to spite bruce
she ought to- but jill couldnt
think any further she didnt dare
let herself think for fear she might
forget that she hated bruce carroll
now and only remembered that last
night she had loved him
  at ten to eight jill felt like run-
ning away any place where she
wouldnt have to see either harry
or bruce again-ever her fingers
were shaking so she could scarcely
hold her lipstick and her lips were
quivering so she could hardly get it
on straight and then the bell rang
  for a moment she was afraid it
was bruce and for a fraction of a
second she hoped it might be but
it wasnt it was harry borden
  lady his glance traveled over
jills slim figure admiringly you
sure look good to me no wonder i
bobbed up out of the past to claim
you you can make up your mind
youre not going to get away from
me again
  of course jill knew he was only
pretending and he smiled when he
said it but there was something
about that smile that made her feel
little and alone
  i wont keep you long she said
hurriedly bruce wont stay hes
not the kind to push himself where
hes not wanted
  and well show him hes not
wanted here wont we gorgeous
he took a step toward jill and she
noticed with a shiver of distaste that
he had been drinking leave it to
me ill get rid of bruce
  that was what she wanted jill
reminded herself-to get rid of
bruce but something was wrong
and suddenly she knew it was
harry borden  he was what was
wrong she should never have
brought him here jill realized
then that she couldnt bear to have
bruce think she loved a man like
karry borden
  its no use she faced him de-
terminedly ive changed my
mind i cant go through with this
i cant pretend that i ever loved
you
  you cant harry wasnt smil-
ing any longer you thought you
could this morning and im sure you
can now you asked me to come
here didnt you he asked darkly
you invited me to play the part of
an old sweetheart well im play-
ing it and i intend to keep right
on--
  the sound of the bell interrupted
him it was bruce jill looked
about wildly she had an absurd
impulse to push harry borden un-
der something-anywhere to hide
him to get him out of the way
  but harry had no intention of be-
ing hidden he reached out and
grasped jill roughly
  come on lets put on an act
that will convince him lets do
this up right
  jill jerked away she ran to the
door and flung it open to admit
bruce carroll
  for a moment she thought he
wasnt coming in he stared at
harry borden and back again at jill
jills hands automatically flew to
her hair she knew how she must
look-flushed slightly disheveled
exactly like a girl who has just been
kissed
  harry spoke first
  dont you think youre intrud-
ing perhaps you cant see this is

street  smiths love story magazine
bruce stepped into the room but left the door open from now on this
is going to be a private party he told harry curtly and youre going
to be on the outside
a private party he said meaningly
  jill couldnt say a word at that
moment her thoughts raced back to
that morning when she had listened
to the office gossip and believing it
had walked out of bruces life her
heart seemed to stop beating she
couldnt even breathe it was
bruces turn now would he be-
lieve harry borden or was his
love big enough to trust her
  bruce didnt hesitate he stepped
into the room but left the door
open
office scandal

  i can see one thing he said
curtly from now  this is go-
ing to be a private party and youre
going to be outside
  harry began to sputter but
bruce silenced him and in another
moment the door was closed and she
and bruce were alone
  it was my fault jill tried des-
perately to keep her voice steady
i asked him here i-i wanted to
show you-
  bruce wouldnt let her say any
more his arms were holding her
close-tender understanding arms
his kisses were on her lips-thrill-
ing rapturous kisses of almost un-
bearable delight
  bruce she whispered brokenly
bruce darling ive loved you all
the time
  bruce kissed her again are you
telling me he asked joyously i
knew that from the beginning
  he picked her up and sa down
in jills big chair it was marvelous
how comfortably two people could
fit in one chair
  and now about lisa
  you dont have to tell me about
lisa jill snuggled closer i was
a jealous little idiot
  i want to tell you about her
bruce interrupted firmly she did
work after hours in the office and
have dinner there and dance but
-he smiled down on jill-i wasnt
the man who was with her perhaps
you remember that writer friend of
mine john howard turner who ex-
plores odd corners of the world and
then turns up every once in a while
with a best seller on his travels
  jill nodded vigorously-as vigor-
ously as she could in the tight circle
of bruces arms
  well he dropped in one day last
summer with some typing that had
to be done immediately and he bor-
rowed my office and lisa to do it
and-you know how attractive some
secretaries can be soon he was bor-
rowing my office whether he had
work to do or not they used it as
a regular meeting place because lisa
hadnt as yet obtained her divorce
and they didnt want to be seen to-
gether till after she was free
  her divorce jill opened her
eyes wide i didnt even knowt she
was married
  scarcely any one did she has
her divorce now thats why she
went away-to get it as soon as
turner comes back again theyre to
be married shell stay with me till
then and break in a new girl so
that-he paused a moment and
then finished very solemnly and ten-
derly-we can be married at once
and to think-jill was almost
breathless with happiness-i al-
most let a silly office scandal spoil
our love ive learned one thing
love isnt all romance and kisses
a big part of it is trust and under-
standing and forgiveness
  bruces arms tightened about her
and his eyes met hers for a long
wonderful moment then slowly
tenderly he kissed her and as jill
thrilled to the rapture of his lips on
hers she knew that always their
love would be a glorious thing be-
cause of their utter faith in each
other
your week

intuition and originality effort in new and
untried lines is advisable always avoiding
the elusive and impracticable channels of
activity mentally you will be alert ex-
plosive and aware of the new and original

            period there being the prob-
            ability of delays and sharp
            criticisms the following hours
            are quite pleasant until about
            p m the subsequent
           hour bringing disappointment
           and restraint in handling ac-
           tivities however after

sunday this is an energetic day in
october spots and a very pleasant one
st	at times the undercurrent
     is erratic and many happen-

          morning hours are unusually
          active for a sunday and the
          afternoon hours bring energy
          too there will be a tendency
          to follow rash impulses be-
          tween  and  this eve-
          ning and between the latter
          hour and  there will be

monday the full moon occurs this
october morning at  a m the

     is the necessity to attend to

           present and emotional up-

your stars and you

too fast this morning and use
judgment in putting new ideas
into effect the noon hour
brings special rash feelings
this is a day which will be

to do and execute matters
rapidly is paramount and yet
the feelings are unreliable

turmoil and an upheaval per-
sonally is indicated until

until  p m are favor-
able and can be utilized in an
efficient manner the day is
active and productive gener-
ally depending upon your
ability to handle matters
rapidly and with judgment
watch your step this evening
there is the tendency to be
rash and irritable if you feel
upset do not inflict yourself
upon others stay to your-
self especially around mid-
night
this is a fair day and an un-
interesting one from a plan-
etary viewpoint there is too
much emotion for efficiency
and accomplishment so your
control over your tempera-
ment is the basis upon which
you will have to work part
of the morning period can be
made productive if you get
started early then deliberate
            judgment should prevail un-

         this morning especially brings
         lethargy and fatigue but you
         will need to stay on the job

  r e w born october   maine
 a m i do not know how you mean
to improve your home conditions true i
can see that you have been thinking of
leaving your husband from the positions in
your chart but you did not give me one
scrap of information as a basis of judging
the circumstances your husband is not as
contented as he would like to be either i
do not advise a separation and it would
be most unfortunate for both of you if there
is an outside emotional interest on the part
of either of you it would result in a
permanent break the only remedy i can
suggest is a temporary separation-a mari-
tal vacation so to speak if this is done
i believe you would come back together
again
  mrs j h husband born in february
that is the trouble your husband has
had things coming his way loo much you
should have sent me your birthday also
i do not believe he will ever overcome his
liking for liquor and his control of the habit
will have to come from within himself he
is the type of person that has to learn
through experience and i cannot tell
whether or not you have any influence over
him without your hour of birth but i
doubt it he is a very stubborn and
opinionated young man the only thing
you can do is to continue to cooperate and
allow him to work out his program for him-
self
  texas a-l born august   noon
texas it is obvious that you are inter-
ested only in having a home you have
many capabilities among them being an
artistic talent and the capacity to write
you will have to make your own choice
the year  is a line one for you in which
to do some creative work i do not think
you would like stenographic work at all
the young man has influence for marriage
next spring and you will have the impulse
too it is all right to enter matrimony if
the conditions are acceptable to you

street  smiths love story magazine
  apxy data omitted by request how
can i tell you about c there is a set of
circumstances which you have to discuss
between yourselves even though i realize
he is hard to handle at this time he is
vague and confused in his mind and does
not know what he wishes to do if there is
another interest in his life my advice is to
ignore it the wise course is to go along
and keep up the pretense forget your
pride until he comes to his senses he will
be more serious next year and his financial
status will improve for heavens sake be
tolerant if you make one false move now
you will regret it and there will be no more
marriage your future adjustments de-
pends entirely upon you and the best course
is for you to appeal to his emotions he
is most susceptible to love and kindness
hope you work out the problem
  mrs m c born july   kansas
 a m sorry but i believe this affair
is over you were foolish in acting as you
did and his pride is hurt your chart does
not blend well with his anyway and you
will have other opportunities to marry the
strongest indication being in  if i
were you i would admit to him that i was
wrong and try to -renew the friendship but
keep it as a friendship this man is the
type to be through when he has once made
up his mind and you will find yourself get-
ting along with him much better if you
keep your relations purely upon a friendly
basis
  mrs c m e born july   
p m i can appreciate your position and
sympathize with you that is an unpar-
donable situation to have on your hands
surely there is something you can do to
eliminate this person from your home it
should be done as soon as possible i do
not blame you for your resentment has
your husband no influence at all in that
quarter after all it is up to him and
while i know it is difficult for him to take
drastic steps with one of his own family it
io unfair to you wish you had sent me
the birth dates of all concerned i could
be more definite if you had you will be
much happier next year as your personal
influences are improving but i do not
think you should tolerate the present state
of affairs there are changes indicated for
you next spring and if you are unable to
accomplish your purpose before that time
you should take every way possible next
may otherwise you will miss the value
of your improved planetary conditions
  l o r born august   
p m you forgot to tell me where you
were born young lady the young man is
right in putting his career before his inter-
est in you he is ambitious and if you care
for him you should be glad that he wishes
to be financially solvent before undertaking
marriage his influences are good this year
and i am glad to see him starting in busi-
ness under his present aspects i believe
he will make money in  your charts
blend well but it is up to the young man
to create the opportunity for marriage if
you are a wise girl you will be sympathetic
and helpful and not try to force issues
just be patient i do not believe you will
regret it if you wait
  ldggis m l s born november  
kentucky  p m you certainly
were right when you said that you were
temperamental but you will get over that
as you get older and yet you are the
type of person that has to have deep feel-
ings and an emotional interest in anything
that you do in order to succeed you
should be in the business world you like
the feeling that a successful commercial
venture brings just how you are equipped
in training and environment to accomplish
this purpose i do not know the next
three years will bring you accomplishment
and fulfillment but the results depend upon
yourself the planetary conditions are fa-
vorable and will be helpful if you care to
use them marriage is indicated in the
summer months of 
  miss a l data omitted by request
you just go right ahead with your work
and wait for marriage until circumstances
bring it to you there will be a deep emo-
tional interest in your life in  but you
must not force issues there is marriage
in the future but if it does not come until
 do not worry about it you can
marry next year if you like but i advise
you to wait you have no idea how much
progress you are going to make in the next
two years in the commercial field and in
 you will be able to increase your in-
come thanks for your interest you
should undertake the study of astrology as
a hobby you would like it and find your-
self making strides in it very shortly
  l z born december   indiana
 a m the reason you have lost faith
in people is because you have built your
belief upon too idealistic a plane and for-
gotten that your fellow man is human
your stars and you

uso i would like to say that you are forr
tunate in having had only one year of what
you are pleased to call bad luck your
entire life is ahead of you and while jupiter
is helpful you have to be practical and take
advantage of opportunities meanwhile mak-
ing your own too most of your difficult
influences are past and the next two and
one half years look very promising wake
up and get a new viewpoint be serious
about your business career and coordinate
your forces keep your writing as a hobby
lor the present but do not give up your
literary inclinations you will be able to
capitalize upon them in the future even
if you do not marry before you are thirty
you have nothing to worry about there
will be an opportunity for such a step the
latter part of  and there is more than
one marriage in your life
  i d r born march   wisconsin
 a m it requires longer than i
would like to get around to your letters
but you readers are patient souls and seem
to understand the length of time it takes
to prepare our magazine for national dis-
tribution sorry you had to wait com-
paring your data with the other two charts
i shall have to discard the october one
he is attractive to you and there is a strong
physical urge shown between you but the
august person is much better suited to
your temperament and he will be more
likely to fulfill your ambitious and expecta-
tions there is no indication of an im-
mediate marriage for you unless you took
that step this fall and you might have
done so due to the strongly emotional plan-
etary conditions there is a strong indica-
tion in  of an attraction and there is a
definite one about three years from now
  miss m u born august   bel-
gium  a m i advise you to pursue
both these courses the mans chart blends
with yours very nicely and i believe you
could have a pleasant life together if both
of you make up your minds not to nag and
criticize each other there i no reason
why you should give up your career just
because of marriage
  mrs g s born december  
michigan  a m it seems to me that
the current circumstances are desirable for
you as there is little harmony shown be-
tween the two charts of course it is obvi-
ous that you do not wish your life to be
subjected to criticism because of the un-
truths some one has circulated about you
and you are wise to contest the action
if this party had any chivalry it would be
understood that you would be the aggres-
sor perhaps you can sell the idea and
create an amicable situation try any-
way it is always unfortunate to have this
type of thing end with bitterness it looks
to me as if you two might be able to get
together on this planetary conditions in
 are better for both of you

it is human to yearn for the
spoken word of approval love
appreciation and praise from
those who have it in their power to
produce upon our heartstrings either
sadness or happiness most men
are apt to get plenty of attention
from girls who love them most
wives too do not neglect to make
some outward show of approval of
their husbands and yet many
men seem to scorn the idea of re-
ciprocating these same little ges-
tures so dear to every womans
heart when compliments and
praise cease and a woman is allowed
to become starved for attention and
the little niceties the man of her
heart once showered upon her dis-
appointment in love is not far off
 dear mrs brown im a young mar-
ried woman not yet twenty-seven and
have been married six years we have two
darling children a boy and a girl my hus-
band adores them and so do i
  the trouble is that although i think my
husband loves me as much as he ever did
sometimes i am tempted to believe that
most unhappiness in marriage is caused by
the man taking his wife too much for
granted
  during the first three years of our mar-
riage my husband used to pay me all sorts
of compliments the way he did when we
were engaged hed notice if my hair was
done differently or when i had something
new to wear and was always interested in
how i spent my time hed tell me i
looked sweet and even my culinary efforts
werent overlooked
  but how different everything is now i
know he loves me and yet he seldom
notices what i wear how i look or cares
where i go and what i do it isnt as
though id let myself go as some wives do
i am still considered very attractive have
naturally golden hair blue eyes use make-
up and dress well if not better than i
used to before i was married
  of course i long to be noticed especially
by tom im not so aged that i dont care
whether or not he thinks i look nice but
i am losing heart mrs brown must a
girls sweetheart turn out to be such a flop
after marriage when it comes to love-
making why are men so blind once the
girl they courted is tied to them for life
sometimes i seem to be just about as ex-
citing to him as a piece of furniture
  my husband expects me to be interested
in what he does and to show him that i
appreciate everything he does for me and
the children if i should ignore him as he
does me he at once thinks there is some-
thing wrong with me he seems to want
me to think that his interests are of the
greatest importance and mine of none at
all

street  smiths love story magazine
  i am sure there isnt another woman in
the case mrs brown is it so unreason-
able for a wife to expect her husband to
notice her and to show her that he ap-
preciates her as he used to do before
marriage
  whenever i read about lonely wives and
how some of them accept the attentions of
other men i often think it serves a hus-
band right if he neglects his young wife to
the point where she is starved for some
attention
  as long as i love ray husband and have
my children to think of i suppose ill try
to put up with this indifference on his part
but it certainly isnt all honey for a wife
once the sweetheart idea has worn off to
a shadow i would love to hear from other
readers and especially men as to why hus-
bands forget that a wife is human and
needs as much attention after five or ten
years of marriage as she did before mar-
riage	almost disgusted
  it would seem that from time im-
memorial men have been used to
feminine praise and have taken it
for granted that such praise is due
them because they have to go out
and toil for their families but do
they really forget that their wives
also toil and that praise and an
outward show of appreciation we
humans find so sweet would be wel-
come when the monotony of house-
keeping is over for the day
  let us observe any two young
people in love they compliment
each other pay attention to each
others likes and dislikes and are
usually careful not to appear indif-
ferent to each others interests
  but what happens in so many
cases after several years of mar-
riage judging from the countless
letters that reach this department
it would appear that husbands are
often to blame for many unhappy
marriages because they forget that
wives are warm-hearted human be-
ings hungry for compliments soft
flatteries and comments of ap-
proval
  a man may love his wife think
all the lovely things in the world
about her but if he stints on words
and actions of praise how can she
know what he feels
 if men would only remember
that a few sincere compliments
mean so much to a woman one of
the serious thorns in marriage would
be quickly removed
  dear mrs brown may i say a few
words to girls who are in doubt as to how
they can keep their boy friends interested
the main point id say is to know your
man
  if my two experiences will be of help to
some other girl here they are i went
steady with a young man for a long time
we became engaged but because i showed
him that i did not care for the company
of other boys and wanted him only he got
the idea that no one else could possibly be
interested in me with the result that our
engagement is now a thing of the past
  then i met another boy i liked i
thought i would try a different method
with him i teased and led him a merry
chase went out with other boys and he
was never sure of me he finally decided
that i couldnt possibly be constant so
you see what you can do with one man
you cant do with another some men like
to be tackled and give the girl the reins
to steer them hither and yon while others
like to be the hunters in love and feel dis-
gusted with high-handed tactics
  however i for one have decided to
play high-hat and wait for my phone calls
even if i have to wait the rest of my life
a girl has only her pride and reputation
both of which men are ever so ready and
willing to snatch why not give the boys
a run for their money let them come
after you i have had plenty of experience
that showed me the wisdom of this de-
cision	baby face
  your turn now family should
men as baby face says be given a
run for their money are they
really so selfish and mercenary as to
stand ready to snatch a girls pride
and reputation lets hear from
you
  dear mrs brown may i talk to you
for a littie while and tell you my story
  about nine months ago i fell deeply in
the friend in need

love my love was returned of that i am
certain and for a while i was in heaven i
wonder now if that sense of utter happiness
is ever permanent we were both weak
and all the time  was conscious of the fact
that i was doing something wrong that no
matter how much we loved each other i
was lowering myself
  for him it was different at least i
thought so because although i am a girl i
believe in the double standard in other
words it was wrong for me but not for
him still i couldnt break away i was
foolish enough to believe that if that was
the way he wanted me id do anything
even go as far as to fling everything i held
sacred to the four winds
  about this time my aunt opened her
winter home in florida and i went to
spend three weeks with her during that
time it seems ages i discovered what i
was already almost certain of that other
men might amuse me but never hold me
  i enjoyed their company even had mar-
velous times but i couldnt forget under-
neath it all i wasnt satisfied there was
always something missing and i was dis-
contented the evening before i left for
home i chucked my social obligations
and rode alone almost all night trying to
find the answer to at least a few of my
questions and when i returned home it was
with the determination to end things
  i saw him that evening mrs brown and
before he left i had the courage to tell him
we couldnt possibly go on as we had been
i didnt ask the impossible that he change
for me merely that he stop calling and
when he told me he couldnt i used the
only argument left i told him i no longer
loved him
  i know i hurt him horribly but i
couldnt help it when he kissed me
good-by he said he didnt see how it was
possible to love so completely as he loved
me and not have that love returned but
true to his word he hasnt tried to get in
touch with me since
  i have lots of social obligations that must
be fulfilled but each time i sit across the
table from some chap i see another face
and every time i dance its with his arms
around me i know ive literally thrown
away my chance of happiness and even
though what i did took strength ive not
a shred of it left to carry on with
  mother thinks i am plain crazy to have
sent him away when i care so much but
she doesnt know why and i pray she never
may dad however agrees with me that
i am too young to become serious and
wants mother and me to go to europe for
a change im so sick of doctors tonics
warnings about not eating enough and
nervous breakdowns that i really dont
care where they take me
  one thing i do want you to know and
that is that marriage doesnt enter into this
at all im too young and though this
boy is two years my senior hes not ready
to settle down either do you think ive
done the right thing in breaking up with
him
  even though ive done wrong according
to conventions i cant say i m sorry be-
cause this love has given me some wonder-
ful moments it will be very hard to for-
get him but i am not sure that our love
will last until we are old enough and ready
to marry do you think i should wait for
him and expect him to wait for me
poor little rich girl
  it is undeniable that experience is
the great dispeller of illusions espe-
cially when youth begins to discover
that there is a price to be paid for
too much freedom where loves
young dream is concerned you
dont say how old you are but if
neither you nor this boy is old
enough to think of settling down to
marriage then youre probably too
young to think seriously of love
  its sad but true that very young
people are apt to mistake the
novelty of an exciting romantic ad-
venture for real love having a
crush on a boy who has captured
your fancy and forgetting conven-
tions does not balance the scales
where real love is concerned
  much as i would like to do so i
am not endowed with mystic power
that would enable me to look ahead
and tell you whether or not any
affection that may now exist be-
tween you and this boy will last
until you are older and ready to con-
sider marriage but if you have
already sent your friend away
wouldnt it be wiser to leave the
matter as it stands continue with
your other interests and let father
time take care of your to-morrows

street  smiths love story magazine
 dear mrs brown im a girl of
twenty-three and for the past four years
i have been going with a young man four
years my senior i am considered good
looking dress well and hold a good
position
  im not engaged to this boy and never
have been but during the first three years
we went together i saw him almost every
night of course we quarreled now and
then and parted several times but we
always made up
  my family have continually nagged at
me to give him up because he drinks and
behaves terribly when drunk about two
years ago he started to slap me when he
was in this condition the next day hed
beg me to forgive him saying he was sorry
but the same tiling has happened many
times
  a year ago a man around thirty years
of age came to work in our office lie
asked me to go out with him but i re-
fused one day however i had a quarrel
with my boy friend and he beat me up
after that i made up my mind to go out
with others so the next time this new
man asked me for a date i accepted
  he seemed so considerate and wonder-
ful after what i went through with the
other boy that i started to go out with
him quite often i know youll think me
terrible when i say that this man was mar-
ried and i knew it the first time i went
out with him was because i was so dis-
couraged about the other boy but grad-
ually we began going out three and four
times a week
  then some one told his wife and she
left him i continued to date him after
a year of that i finally realized how wrong
it was for me to go out with him so i gave
him up i made up with my first boy
friend but when he found out about the
married man he accused me of pretty
nearly everything he struck me and told
all our friends i was cheap enough to run
after a married man
  finally this man made up with his wife
but he kept telling me that he wasnt
happy and that he loved me i was still
going with my first boy friend in spite of
his abuse but we parted a few weeks ago
because i just couldnt stand it any longer
he follows me around however stops me
whenever he can tries to talk to me and
if i wont he slaps me hes always throw-
ing it up to me that i was a married mans
sweetheart
  but this married man never made any
advances to me i sent him away because
i realized that it was wrong he even
wanted to get a divorce and marry me but
i managed to convince him that we could
never be happy if we made his wife un-
happy he still loves me and i love him
though ill never let him know i told him
i loved the first boy though thats a lie
because i sometimes hate him more than
it seems possible for one human being to
hate another
  last week the three of us met at a party
and when my first boy friend met the mar-
ried man he struck me since then he
comes around to my place of business and
tells me that i deserved the beating be-
cause he says i invited this married man
to the party so i could see him but i
didnt i couldnt help it if some one else
brought him along i didnt even know he
was coming
  in the four years i have been going with
this boy he ran around with married and
divorced women and denied all the stories
i heard until i saw him myself he was
to blame for my actions and now he wants
me to make up i know if i marry him i
will have a terrible life
  i know youll tell me to forget him and
i would like to do that but he just wont
stay away he tells me that if i ran
around with a married man once ill do it
again and hes there to see that i dont
three days ago this other man phoned and
asked me to see him but i refused he
told my friends that if he couldnt have
me he hoped id never marry the other
fellow because he has caused me so much
trouble i am desperate
unhappy arline
  no girl is obliged to marry a man
who is as despicable as your first
boy friend arline for goodness
sake shake yourself awake and re-
member that this is  if he
wont keep away from you tell your
family about it and if they
havent sufficient influence to make
him stay away from you the mighty
hand of the law will im sure bear
some weight with him you
neednt be quite spineless simply be-
cause like a bad boy he says i
wont
 when a girl is thinking of mar-
riage she should try to choose a
man of character and dignity
the friend in need

every girl wants a husband of
whom she can be proud and who
will treat her with consideration
but she cant blame any one but
herself if she allows herself to be
bullied into marriage
  as for the married man make it
a final no-and make it sound
final im sure that if he sees you
are firm he will stop calling
  dear mrs brown how can a girl be
normal happy and carefree if all around
her she sees nothing but bitterness and
bickering that would drive any one crazy
  im a girl of sixteen my father died
when i was quite young and my mother
married again for a little while every-
thing seemed to be all right but you
should visit my home now its fight fight
fight all the time
  ive seen so many unhappy marriages
that  dont think i will ever marry my
mother goes out with other men and my
stepfather does his share of going places
with other women
  sometimes i think that i have seen
enough of life to make any one sick of it
ive had a little experience myself i
started to date boys when i was fourteen
at fifteen  kept company with a boy of
twenty-two right now im going out with
a married man who doesnt live with his
wife he is thirty but whats the dif-
ference people say like mother like
daughter they dont give me a chance
they expect me to be bad and theyll talk
anyway i often feel as if id like to give
them something to talk about
  before i started going with this married
man i was crazy about a young fellow i
think i was really in love with him then
some one lied to him about me and he be-
lieved that person he didnt even give me
a chance to explain
  you may say he couldnt have cared for
me and maybe he didnt care as much for
me as i did for him but that didnt stop
my loving him i still think of him even
though i tell some of my friends that i
hate him im so lonely that i could cry
but i smile and pretend im happy all
my so-called friends would laugh if they
heard me say that i was lonely
sad sixteen
  when a girl has such a poor ex-
ample of what happiness can really
mean it is small wonder that she
feels disillusioned and somewhat
hopeless regarding marriage and
her own future i sympathize with
you my child but let me assure you
that unhappy marriages are the ex-
ception and not the rule
  whenever young girls of sixteen
moon around and think theyre in
love it usually turns out to be
nothing more than a schoolgirl in-
fatuation perhaps there is no
harm in an attack of puppy love
now and then but its unwise to
allow yourself to think that life isnt
worth living just because some boy
disappoints you
  it isnt always a simple matter to
erase unfavorable impressions from
a youthful mind but i think that
if you would stop dating boys-
drop them altogether for six months
or longer-and harness your in-
terests in other directions life would
take on new meaning for you
  join girls clubs and if it is at
all possible go to live with a
relative for a while its really a
pity that your mother has so little
consideration for you and so little
respect for herself perhaps you
can even go back to school if you
have to hold down a job go to night
school where you can take up some
course that might interest you
  if you throw yourself whole-
heartedly into the change a more
balanced perspective will gradually
return to you come again
  dear mrs brown im a young fellow
of twenty but feel about fifty after all ive
gone through ever since i was fifteen i
have been going with a girl i knew from
school and about a year ago we became
engaged we planned to get married last
may two weeks after our engagement
was announced i found out that the
previous spring she had been in trouble and
that the man had paid her several hun-
dred dollars to straighten things out
  of course i thought that she had learned

street  smiths love story magazine
her lesson and because i really cared for
the girl i saw no sense in bringing it up
it hurt me deeply to find this out about
her but i decided to forgive her and go
on as before
  things ran along smoothly i had
several hundred dollars saved to start our
home with but the bank in our town closed
up and i dont know yet whether ill ever
get my money or not when i went to see
my fiancee she treated me very coldly
she said she was sorry this happened but
she behaved as if i were a stranger and
we quarreled then she became sweet
again but it didnt last i hated to think
that because id apparently lost my money
she didnt want to marrv me
  one day when we were quarreling i told
her that i knew about her and this man
she said that i was very old-fashioned and
jealous and if i thought she was going to
stay home waiting until i made more
money and could take her places i was
mistaken
  but the next day she wrote that she was
sorry and didnt think what she was say-
ing and begged me to forgive her which
i did a week or two after that she came
to see my mother who wasnt feeling well
at the time
  after she left our home she went to see
a cousin of hers who lived in the next
block and spread the story that my mother
was lazy because she didnt even try to
serve my fiancee something to eat while
she was there however once more i for-
gave her then she wrote me that she
didnt want to get married and sent back
the ring
  three weeks ago i saw an announcement
of her engagement to another fellow he
is very well off financially and can give her
lots more than i could i met her on the
street after that and she begged me to
forgive her but she wouldnt break up with
this other fellow she said because he takes
her out a lot
  for the past two weeks i have been go-
ing with another girl trying to forget but
i dont seem to be able to do that this
other girl has told me that she loves me
and wants to get married she is very
sweet and thinks i feel about her as she
does about me but i hate to keep on de-
ceiving her i only told her i cared for her
to find out how she felt about me
  i really do think a great deal of her and
when we are together i dont feel so bad
about the other girl in fact ive almost
decided to marry this girl because she be-
lieves that i love her and i wouldnt want
to break her heart my former fiancee
knows i go with this girl and says that
if i take her back she will break with this
fellow
  please tell me what to do mrs brown
my heart tells me to take her back but
my sense of honor and common sense tell
me to marry the other girl who im sure
wouldnt treat me like the first girl did i
often think that if i marry the second girl
ill be happy with her because she is so
good and sweet disappointed reader
  habits and points of view as well
as traits of character are pretty
well fixed before two people marry
and nothing is more foolish than to
try to convince yourself that the
person youre attracted to can make
you happy when the linger of bet-
ter judgment points against it
perhaps that is where the saying
that love is blind comes into its own
  the girl youve been engaged to
has proved by her actions that she
isnt quite worthy of your love and
if you give yourself a fair chance
you will in time become much
more deeply attached to another
girl but i wouldnt advise you to
marry a girl you know you dont
love even though she is sweet and
good and sincere and you feel that
you may learn to return her affec-
tion
  you know the old saying about
haste my suggestion is that you
do nothing for at least two or three
years why because youre too
young to really know your own
heart and mind though you may
think you do and because youre
not in love with the girl you think
you should marry you should
also have something set aside to
start housekeeping on and above
all because youre upset dis-
appointed and are not at all sure
what you want to do
  let it all pass make no rash de-
cisions waste no more time on the
first girl go on being friendly with
the friend in need

the second girl and have other girl
friends too by the time a couple
of years pass things will clear up for
you not only in your own mind but
financially too and youll be more
sure as to what you should do
 dear mrs brown two years ago
when i graduated from business school i
found a position with a firm of lawyers
i was then eighteen years old
  the firm consists of four lawyers my job
is to take dictation from one of them and
help out another member of the firm the
other two have their own stenographers
  the lawyer i worked for is a bachelor
around thirty-two for about a year
everything was all right and i liked my
job then he started to tell me funny
stories and asked me personal questions as
to how many boy friends i had how often
i dated them did i go to dances et cetera
  then he surprised me by asking if i
would kiss him i said not unless im
forced to but didnt realize at the mo-
ment how foolish and perhaps even invit-
ing this remark must have sounded
  anyway a day or so later he put his
arms tight around me from behind as i was
sitting at my desk and kissed me this
happened many times of course i pro-
tested but he seems to make it a sort of
habit
  hes asked me several times to go out
with him but so far ive refused he
hasnt gone beyond kissing me i would
hate to resign as i like my work and need
the money and work is rather scarce just
now also i am almost the sole support
of our family ive asked him countless
times to leave me alone but he just laughs
it off he kisses me when i least expect it
  i dont know what to do am i doing
wrong in allowing him to go on like this
a girl can flirt and kiss other men and it
seems all right but when it comes to her
employers why is it different and con-
sidered terrible i know that if the other
girls in the office knew about this theyd
be gossiping about me all the time
secretary beth
 business is business and as a
general rule flirtations between
girls and their employers mix no
better than oil and water theres
no question that there exists the
type of man who labors under the
impression that just because he pays
a girls salary he can play romeo
during business hours
  judging from your letter how-
ever i doubt very much if your em-
ployer would go on kissing you once
you really put your foot down and
make it very plain to him that this
sort of thing must stop if hes a
gentleman he will not force his at-
tentions on you if you show him
that his advances are distasteful to
you
 but perhaps your vanity is
flattered that hes keen enough
about you to ask you to go out with
him and there may be something
in your actions which does not quite
convince him that you actually re-
sent his advances you may not
have been firm enough with him
  of course if he persists youll
have to find another way out
couldnt you talk to the head of
the firm for instance and ask him
to assign one of the other girls to
take this mans dictation
  dear mrs brown i was married at
nineteen and have been very unhappy i
have tried my best to make our marriage
a success but somehow things went wrong
  bill and i both worked after we were
married and though neither of us earned
a great deal our combined earnings were
enough to provide a fairly comfortable
living however bill started to drink and
when i begged him to stop he paid no
attention to me finally his drinking cost
him his job
  i never wanted very much i wanted a
little home furniture of our own and was
satisfied with few clothes but no matter
how hard i tried i didnt seem to be get-
ting anywhere i left bill four times be-
cause i couldnt stand seeing him drunk
around the house and because i hoped it
would wake him up he promised to do
better each time i left and of course i
always went back
  when i found out finally that i couldnt
go on like this and that i didnt really
love him any more because he had killed
all the feeling ive ever had for him i left
town once in a while i went out with

street  smiths love story magazine
other men the men i really liked wanted
to marry me after a while but marriage
of course was out of the question for me
cant men be just pals
  im twenty-two now and in the past two
years i have lived in four different cities
im so discontented and restless i dont
know what to do to find a little peace and
happiness i know there are many things
i should be thankful for im healthy can
easily earn my own living and i have lots
of friends but i feel that something is
wrong
  when i go to a party ill start having a
good time and then suddenly i want to
get away from every one see new faces and
just drop every one i know of course 
dont do exactly that but now and then i
dont see any one for a week at a time and
i stay home
  i have been in this city four months
have a good job and i ought to be happy
and satisfied but im ready to pack up
and be on the go do you think im silly
im all alone my parents died four years
ago and i have no brothers or sisters
  is there any way i can overcome this
feeling of restlessness and dissatisfaction
i dont like to brood-theres nothing i like
better than to laugh and be gay i have
some nice girl friends and know several
worth-while men so i shouldnt be lonely
ill appreciate anything you can tell me
restless shirley
  in spite of everything life holds
happiness for every one of us but
it doesnt come done up in pack-
ages and handed over a counter
you may say that youre not lonely
or that you shouldnt be lonely be-
cause you have men and women
friends but deep down in your heart
you are very lonely and the sense
of having failed or missing the
really vital thing so important to
most women-a happy marriage-is
what makes you miserable
  you can spend a lifetime rushing
from place to place groping among
new interests for that mysterious
something which you think will
make you happy but no one in this
world ever found happiness by
flitting around restlessly
  if theres not the slightest change
of your husband pulling himself to-
gether so that you can make a real
start together again then why re-
main in this uncertain and exas-
perating situation youre not
exactly a wife and you cant be a
sweetheart make up your mind
definitely one way or the other and
then act accordingly happiness is
a thing of slow growth it has to be
fought for before it can be won
  dear mrs brown four years ago 
married a boy one year younger than i i
really loved him then and still do regard-
less of all the heartbreaking things that
have happened the first two years of our
marriage were perfect in every way but
arent the first two or three years always
perfect the last two years have been
nothing less than a nightmare i wonde
what others would have done if they had
been in my shoes
  the trouble started when my husband
began to drink from liquor to running
around with women was a short step i
dont smoke or drink but im not at all
old-fashioned and consider myself modern
in every other respect
  i tried several methods in my effort to
reform my husband but i failed each time
after almost a year of staying home alone
nights and trying to pay our bills out of
what was left of his salary i just couldnt
put up with things any longer
  i told him that i was going home i
packed my things and left and went back
to work my husband pretended that lie
didnt miss me but he started to act
wilder than ever every one who knew us
pitied me finally i decided that divorce
would be the best way out
  needless to say i was heartbroken but
i thought it might wake him up if i de-
manded money well i got my money
but he didnt change and i wasnt any
happier then my husband fell sick he
caught cold and it developed into
pneumonia he called for me all the time
and at last i went to see him he wanted
me back he said he loved me i remarried
him for two months everything went
fine then he went out one day got
drunk and never came back he stayed
away eight months
  i worked night and day trying to for-
the friend in need	
get my misery i went out of course and
even had three proposals to marry but
every night i sent up a prayer for my lost
husband i learned to take knocks with a
smile i became independent and promised
myself not to let anything hurt me again
 a month ago my husband came back
he seemed changed in looks was more
quiet and refined but he didnt find me as
easy as i had been before he begged me
to give him another chance so i put him
on probation for a year i felt that it was
a year against a lifetime i know that i
wont change my mind and take him back
before that year is up no matter how often
he begs me to make up now
  i havent given up yet and im going
to keep right on hoping that things will
turn out all right my husband seems a
changed man but i will not let him break
my resolution if he disappoints me i
wont let him hurt me as he did before
  i	hope some other wife tries this method
it may solve her problem it is now seven
months since my husband and i are good
friends i see him once a week the rest
of the time he works from what i can
sec it would appear that hes working
hard
  last week he showed me a bank book
with several hundred dollars to his credit
so it looks as though hes saving his
money and i havent noticed that hes
drinking or running around with other
women he lives two blocks away and
his landlady says he seldom goes out and
then only to a movie i think my plan is
going to work out all right i hope so
dorothy s
  and i hope so too dorothy be-
lief and strength in your own con-
victions will help you find ultimate
happiness if your husband is
working so hard to get you back it
looks as if hell turn out to be the
right kind of husband after all
when the year of probation is up
good luck to you wont you write
again and let us know how things
have turned out

 dear mrs brown why are men so
easily deceived by women who have noth-
ing to do but break up homes and enjoy
themselves by vamping other womens hus-
bands i suppose mine can be considered
an old story but no matter how old the
story is its usually new to the person who
is on the wrong side of it
  six years ago i married a man i loved
dearly i still love him he loved me at
the time of our marriage and for four
years we were very happy then came
promotion in his work and a transfer to
another branch of the business brought
him in contact with women and thats
where the trouble started
  the first thing he did was to begin to
drink-just to be sociable he said then
he started to run around first with one
woman and then another lied about busi-
ness engagements and stayed out all hours
of the night we have no children and i
am glad of it now because of what hap-
pened
 then my husband began to complain
when i wanted him to take me out i
thought it might be my fault so i started
to take an interest in the things i knew
interested him and kept my home in fine
order for a few months he forgot to com-
plain and then the same things began to
happen again one day he said he was
going out of town on business and hasnt
returned
  of course i dont mean that i havent
heard from him i have he arranged to
send me an allowance and i continue to
live in our cozy little apartment the
worst of it all is that i love him dearly
and probably always will he was the
only man i ever cared for and i know
that a reconciliation is out of the question
now
  a wife seems to mean so little in a
mans life are men not to be trusted with
a womans heart i feel as if there is
nothing for me to live for im sure i cant
love any other man ive lived alone for
almost two years now and i feel worse all
the time	mrs x
  tragic as it is many compara-
tively young women are confronted
with an early marriage failure some
wives may be partly to blame some
may not but always life must go
on and although it is much easier
said than done it is only logical that
broken dreams should be shelved
along with the other disappoint-
ments fate hands out to every one
of us in one form or another
  the most important thing for
you to do now my dear is try not
to sour on marriage men in general
and the idea that life can hold noth-
ing more for you such an outlook
is apt to ruin your disposition and
unbalance your perspective
 living cooped up with your
emotions marring each day with old
heartaches isnt going to help you
get over the past if another mar-
riage is out of the question now find
other interests and gain the happy
satisfaction that comes from accom-
plishing something worth while
  no matter what your disappoint-
ments you still have a life to live
and it is up to you as to how youre
going to live that life whether its
going to be filled with misery or
made tolerable and purposeful is for
you to determine
