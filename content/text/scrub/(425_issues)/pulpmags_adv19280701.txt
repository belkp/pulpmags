employers prefer fastidious people
   halitoxics not wanted
more and more employers insist on
having about them people who are

  thc true reason for discharge however is

  realize these facts about halitosis that
due to modern habits ir is much more preva-
lent than is suspected that it is a definite
liability in friendships affections and busi-
ness that you can have it and not know it
  the one means of being sure that you are
free from it is to rinse the mouth systemati-

night and between times when necessary
especially before meeting others keep a
bottle handy in home and office for this
purpose

 were going for a bath
heres a lot of people walking and the
artist says theyre talking-theyve al-
ready told him secretly were going for
a bath
so dancing on their bath horizon theres
a sight to rest their eyes on now theyll
change their bathrobes for an ivory lather
coat
he says they seem so hopeful they will
find tubs floating-soapful that he dares
not give them sinker-soap because he fears
their wrath
theyll have no more of bluish soap of
green or scarlet-huish soap-these creamy
cakes alone will do and every one will
float
           ivory is really the nicest soap to bathe with thats
           ever been made not only does it float right where
           you can see it and reach it drop it when you will
           but it quickly gives a lovely creamy lather which
           cleanses thoroughly and then rinses off instantly
kind to everything it touches

duke and the ducats
   tex macdowell and duke
   dalyj border flyersj oom down
   on a shady deal in a booming
   texas oil town
   by thomson burtis
robert daly sometimes
known as the duke climbed
out of the trim little scout he
-had just landed on the mcmul-
len airdrome his eyes were still glowing
as a result of one of the few intervals of
complete happiness which life afforded
him there was an admixture of pain
with the sheer delight of flying however
once he had been a regular army flyer
instead of merely in the reserve corps
and a member of that same mcmullen
flight of the border patrol which the
army air service flew along the rio
grande
  as he walked toward headquarters one
of the line of frame buildings on the
southern edge of the tiny flying field the
almost boyish light in his eyes changed
to the shadow which habitually darkened
them that he was not still a regular
army flyer he realized was due to the
outlaw he had been before his army days
and flying for him must always remain an
occasional treat just another installment
of the payment for his past which would
never be completed   
  lieutenant macdowell wishes to see
you sir in headquarters
  the mechanic saluted smartly salut-
ing on that small post was a rarity be-
cause officers and men passed each other
too frequently but somehow the men
always saluted daly
  thanks nodded the duke and at the
same moment he saw the tall form of
lieutenant tex macdowell appear on the
porch and start toward him rapidly
  he removed his helmet revealing
blond hair which lent the last touch of
boyishness to his too perfect face his
clear cut features were like those of some
statue as a matter of fact they had been
carved by plastic surgeons a wreck
back in war days had almost ruined his
face and the artificial one the medicos
had fashioned was as lineless as a boys
from the side he looked twenty-two or
three when one saw his eyes-the eyes
of a man of thirty-one who had seen and
suffered much-the contrast was such
that few people could ever forget him
  listen duke tex called from twenty
feet away howd you like a week end
a complete novelette
trip to that wild new oil town verona
with prospects of excitement
  fine daly replied without outward
interest despite himself he was custom-
arily aloof and indifferent whats
the idea
  got a letter from dad hes in the
east and cant get away he backed an
old friend of his named henry ivers as a
silent partner in an oil machinery business
down there they got into acreage some
way and are getting their eye teeth
rooked out of them by some crook
ivers dont know what to do and dad
wants me to go down and look over the
land and see what can be done henry
is a business man not a rough and tumble
bozo dad knew you were here and
thought you might be of help what
say
  all right with me nodded daly for
all the world as if the prospect were as
thoroughly appealing to him as it was to
the lean texan whose eyes were shining
with enthusiasm where is this verona
  west of laredo they used to call it
park forks
  ghosts of the past rose to drop a film
over dalys eyes and tighten his mouth
his face was a mask now he had
gambled along the rio grande
  about fifteen miles or so north of the
river opposite a little mexican village
called santa verona isnt it he asked
quietly
  tex who knew daly as no one else in
the world did studied him silently
he started to say something and stopped
abruptly
  you can take a couple or three days
off cant you i mean you arent liable
to get urgent orders from washington-
  daly shook his head for more than
three years he had been a special govern-
ment agent his knowledge of the under-
world had made him a valuable one too
he had just finished a job here on the
border
  well then grinned tex i vote we
call up henry ivers right now and get
started this afternoon if its all right
with the captain he said the trip in
general was ok providing we didnt
use our official position to further our

thomson burtis
private ends as it were at that in a
town like verona were liable to run
across stuff thatd interest the govern-
ment a good deal lets go see the cap
i hadnt figured on going until tomorrow
until right this minute
a moment later they were facing
stocky spike pompadoured little
-	captain kennard
  say cap grinned the big south-
ener anything the matter with our
shoving off this afternoon to help out my
poor old father
  kennards raucous laughter filled the
room
  go ahead he chuckled you
wouldnt sleep a wink tonight if you
didnt and thered be no use of having
you around the place excitement is a
disease with you young man
  which it was almost daly reflected
the texan seemed to have some per-
ennial hunger within him which nothing
but dangerous emergencies could assuage
a week of monotony and he was a
brooding temperamental recluse seeking
liquor to deaden his senses the duke
knew what that feeling was-something
always beckoning hijn from around the
corner-and the invariable disillusion-
ment when one found that it was never so
attractive as it seemed but his own rest-
lessness and discontent beat itself against
the hard shell he had built around his real
self and the world rarely knew
  as they went out of the office an
orderly ran toward the hangars to give
orders for their ship they walked
toward the row of tents which were the
living quarters for the dozen officers of the
patrol macdowell momentarily serious
stopped and faced daly
  listen duke he drawled whats
on your mind about this trip anything
that i dont know about i know you
were around the border as a-a gambler
and might have enemies id like to
know so that-you know
  the commonplace words said with a
touch of shyness by the texan con-
veyed the same feeling to daly which
macdowell had aroused years before-
the same spirit shone through which
had made tex the first and only friend
the emotionally starved daly had ever
had five years of want fighting among
the dregs of life years in which he had
lived his mental life alone and displayed
to the world he jived in and despised a
shell which the blows of fate had thick-
ened had brought to daly what he had
thought to be a total self-sufficiency in
macdowell he had found the first under-
standing friend he had ever had in a
brutal effort to test him to discover the
basis of his apparent liking for the aloof
stranger the duke had thrown his past in
the big fellows face-hobo professional
gambler denizen of the underworld be-
cause he had been made so at fifteen he
had spared nothing as though trying to
repel the famous flyer whose friendship
he really wanted so desperately
  and tex had met the test it had not
been dalys present position of respecta-
bility even a certain eminence which had
attracted him for what he had been an
outcast or might be again meant not a
single solitary damn to macdowell
  the inference in his words now sent the
unaccustomed warm glow through duke
daly and momentarily his eyes were soft
tex wanted to have all the facts so he
could fight at dalys right hand if
necessary
  you know daly said without emo-
tion remember the case of jim fitz-
patrick an old coon he shot-and so
forth
  macdowells eyes widened
  and that was within fifteen miles
he said very slowly i dont think itll
mean a thing duke if i did i wouldnt
bring you there not a soul will connect
you with it-and if they do you were
right
  havent the fitzpatricks any friends
left since old dave is in jail
  some-but theyre damn quiet i
dont think theres a thing to worry about
there
  as it turned out there was nothing for
the duke to worry about-there as he
the duke and the ducats

was often to discover however the good
men do lives after them-and when it has
the appearance of evil it seems to live
forever
two hours later the two flyers
dropped their ton-and--half de-
haviland into the airdrome of the
border patrol flight at laredo within
lifteen minutes the gas and oil tanks had
been refilled and they were in the air
again considerable information regard-
ing the town of verona had also come
their way from the flyers if evidence was
needed of the fact that -an oil boom had
changed conditions along that part of the
border the duke thought to himself a
look from the air supplied it
  laredo was the nearest railroad ter-
minus and that sizeable town had
changed considerably since last he had
seen it close to the railroad station
gaunt frame warehouses had arisen like
mushrooms and the streets of the town
were crowded the one road which led
back into the rolling mesquite was a
sight to see it crawled through the
chaparral like a gray snake and it was
crowded with vehicles of all descriptions
from huge trucks to mall wagons drawn
by burros it was rutted so deeply as to
be almost impassable
  there was not a break in the clogged
traffic between laredo and verona
daly felt a thrill as from five thousand
feet he looked down on the newly
created town it looked almost like a
gargantuan circus lot because tempo-
rarily it seemed to be built of canvas
hundreds of tents of all sizes lined the
main road and side streets had been
hacked from the mesquite there were
many crude shacks of all sizes and foot-
paths were lined with every species of
temporary structure from pup tents to
square steel roofed frame buildings
around what had evidently been the
original cross roads with its small cluster
of permanent buildings was the main
part of town
  verona was a tent city almost a mile
square already and here and there
through the mesquite there were isolated
clusters of tents the streets were so
jammed with people that the circus
illusion grew on him no midway just
before show time had ever been more
densely populated from the air it
seemed that a man could have crossed any
of the crude streets on the tops of the
slowly moving vehicles there were no
sidewalks and what were called streets
he could see were merely trails for the
most part and those trails had been
gored by thousands of wheels until they
were like freshly plowed fields many
automobiles and trucks were stalled
others were barely able to move
  gosh if it ever rains not a wheel will
turn for days he thought
  from the town as a nucleus dozens of
zigzag trails hewn from the chaparral
snaked away in all directions derricks
thrust themselves from the mesquite on
all sides pipeline gangs were working
here and there and every road was full of
vehicles jets of steam showed whitely
in many places to indicate where drilling
was going on and here and there were
large areas which were blackened with oil
he saw a half dozen sumps the oil show-
ing black inside them and there were
dozens of others being dug transpor-
tation was so difficult doubtless that
storage tanks would be the last things
brought in
  his heart leaped to the thrill of the raw
power of it all it was as though he were
watching men at grips with mother
nature herself wringing her riches from
her against overwhelming odds there
was an effect of tremendous struggle in
the slowness with which the wagons and
trucks moved the gaunt derricks in all
stages of construction seemed more like
wreckage than like usable pieces of
machinery drillers roughnecks pipe
line men and laborers swariped over an
area of three or four square miles like busy
ants and the town was like a teeming
ant hill stuck out there in the middle of
the wilderness with every bit of food to
say nothing of machinery transport-
ed from fifty miles away it seemed

thomson burtis
unbelievable it was crude and ugly
and sublime
  macdowell turned around his eyes
glowing through his goggles he pointed
north of the town and daly nodded
there was a clearing there and one air-
plane was standing in front of a canvas
hangar
  tex who was flying nosed the ship
down and sent it into a tight spiral
directly above the town now daly
could see that derricks were being con-
structed within the limits of the settle-
ment itself the white city was studded
with them a quarter of a mile east of
verona a closely set group of derricks
their boilers already in operation and
the roughnecks busy on the drilling
floors indicated the original well most
of the derricks were black with oil and a
huge sump was half full from this as a
center the derricks spread in a circle the
forest of them growing thinner and thin-
ner as the circumference of the circle was
reached
  daly shifted his attention to the field
it was small for a de haviland and spots
on it testified to the fact that stumps had
been pulled from its surface however
it presented no problems to a flyer like
macdowell
  he glanced southward santa verona
mexico was in view on the bank of the
river opposite it on the american side
a small settlement looked like a con-
tinuation of the mexican town the
river was all of fifteen miles away and
the two towns combined looked no
bigger than a mans hand that had been
the place where a certain tragedy had
happened ten years before and for a
moment dalys mind brooded over the
past
  then as the twelve cylinder libertys
roar decreased and he felt the terrific
wind against his right cheek which indi-
cated a sideslip he transferred his atten-
tion to the ground underneath him the
center of town was but two miles away
and as he glanced at it he thought
  seems as though there was a little
excitement about us at that thats
funny - theyre used to airplanes
  it did seem that every living soul had
stopped whatever he might have been
doing and was watching the big bomber
come down tex had it sideslipping
right wing down a hundred feet high
and a little- more than two hundred feet
north of the field he brought it level cut
the gun completely and glided toward
the clearing one solitary man stood be-
side the civilian ship watching and on
the derrick floors of the wells close to the
field daly could see that all work had
ceased four men on horseback were
riding into the field as tex brought the
dh down on three points it stopped
rolling fifty feet from the hangar and as
they taxied up alongside the civilian ship
the four horsemen rode to meet them
  the solitary man who had been stand-
ing alongside the ship went into the
hangar
  funny way for a flyer to act thought
daly
  he transferred his attention to the
horsemen they were lined up on the
line and as the de haviland stopped roll-
ing and they could control their horses
better they rode around on the side of it
macdowell turned off the gas and daly
climbed out while the motor was running
itself out
  the horsemen dismounted silently
one man held the reins of all four horses
as the other three walked toward the
duke
  the welcoming committee drawled
tex in his ear and then said aloud
  howdy this is verona i take it
youre not our guards for the ship are
you the man ignored the last ques-
tion
  shore is stayin long
  the speaker was a very small dried up
little man of about forty-five duke esti-
mated and he was slightly ahead of his
companions he was bowlegged but he
wore expensive field boots instead of the
cowboy boots which would have seemed
more in keeping with his appearance
riding breeches of whipcord a wellmade
flannel shirt and an ornate sombrero
the duke and the ducats

which had not cost a ccnt less than sixty
dollars completed his costume his face
was weatherbeaten until it was a mahogany
color and two very cold very keen green
eyes looked speculatively at the flyers
they were narrowed and there were a
million wrinkles around them- his nose
was long and jutted forth boldly above
a neatly trimmed mustache he was a
curious contrast-the clothes of a dandy
and the appearance of an old time cow-
puncher
 just a couple of days daly
answered
  one of the other two men laughed he
was tall and lean and dark faced and his
lips looked to be the kind which could
twist easily into a sneer he was dressed
sloppily his clothes spotted with oil
  yore plannin to stay that long what
fur
  it was the little leader again and his
eyes flitted from one face to the other
there was a challenge in his soft voice-a
sort of metallic ring
  daly looked at him in amazement at
the question
  that he stated evenly would seem
to be our business
  the leaders face did not change but
the other two men chuckled not a par-
ticularly mirthful chuckle daly decided
with rising interest the third man was
short and powerfully built a disreputable
sombrero cocked on one side of his head
and making his scarred face look some-
what tougher than it would have ordi-
narily
  pretty cocky eh newt he in-
quired and the leader turned on him
quickly
  keep yore trap shut he said softly
and the trap was shut without argument
  yore border patrolmen aint yuh
he asked quietly and those eyes were like
gimlets
  yes nodded tex but were just
here on a visit
  the leader expectorated a large quan-
tity of tobacco juice
  the hell yuh say he drawled i
notice yuh brought yore guns
  his eyes were on the machine guns
which were mounted on the ship his
two companions drifted around the air-
plane as though looking it over
  macdowell was leaning negligently
against the side of the fuselage his hand
playing with his colt idly daly saw his
eyes flame suddenly his drawl was very
slow when he finally spoke but the danger
signals were flying something in the a t-
titude of the outwardly inoffensive little
rider had aroused dalys gorge as well
  well what the hell of it macdowell
asked him softly
  the strangers eyes flitted from dalys
to macdowells he walked forward
slowly the other two men out of sight
on the other side of the ship made no
sound as he came forward the rider
pushed his sombrero far back on his head
and duke could see more of his face he
had a lantern jaw hollow creased cheeks
and those eyes seen more plainly were
very wintry looking
  plenty of it mr patrolman he said
with that harsh timbre suddenly obvious
once more you wasnt sent for was
you
  no were not here on business
  so you said im tellin you some-
thin you better go verona dont want
you we can handle our own affairs
around here and dont need no help from
outsiders
  daly could scarcely believe his ears
he took a step forward glancing mean-
ingly at tex
  listen stranger he said in that cool
detached voice of his we didnt ask you
for any advice and we expect to do
just as we damn please we told you we
werent here on duty but whether we are
or not is none of your business and
since youve mentioned it who the hell
gave you any authority to speak for
verona
  yore pretty cocky you boys aint
you drawled the verona man con-
temptuously im jest tellin you two
things were havin a special election
tmorrow and im one o the candidates
for the job o runnin this town we

thomson burtis
dont crave yore help we dont want no
damn airplane buzzin around with guns
on it nor no rangers nor border patrol-
men nor anybody else hornin in t help
us run our business
  dalys mind took in the import of the
strangers words almost unconsciously as
he thought of the possibilities in the
situation
  were not here to run your business
tex told him easily but now that were
on the subject why are you so keen that
we leave here we came down for a
vacation-
  and it looks as though we might have
some work to do and could start in on
you
  daly said that quietly somehow the
personal side of the situation did not seem
so important he felt a vague resent-
ment at the idea of this bandylegged
little southwesterner taking it upon
himself to insult the government in
general
for a long ten seconds the little
westerners eyes held dalys and
they were very cold and keen
when he finally spoke daly who was
ready for anything was almost shocked
at the tenor of his words
  we aint gettin nowhere thisaway
the rider said conciliation in his voice
his two comrades were standing by the
tail surfaces of the ship now whispering
to themselves duke could see them
from the corner of his eye now listen
i aint here t get in bad with you boys
nor t tell you what t do dont git me
wrong heres the situation veronas a
funny town with a funny problem we
aim t run it ourselves right at this time
we aint askin or wantin no outside in-
terference we dont want no outside
cops sheriffs rangers or whatnot runnin
around hog wild arrestin the wrong
people and raisin hell generally this
heres a bunch o men got together from
smackover t tampico it aint even a
town yet we aim t organize our own
law and run our own show
  and its liable t be very very tough
fur anybody from the outside t horn in
yet awhile they aint needed or wanted
and nobody could tell whatd happen
why the hell should you want t butt in
honest im doin you a favor
  it looks to me daly said calmly
as though verona was threatening any
one including us who interfered
  the stranger looked long and hard at
the duke he rolled and lit a cigaret
with absentminded skill
  my names jed conklin he said
suddenly i own acreage am drillin
wells and got a heavy investment here
theres only one way t run a boom town
like this here one which come up from
nothin i aim t have my money pro-
tected the best way i aint goin into it
in detail but im askin you-
  he hesitated it seemed to daly that
a fundamental nastiness of temper-an
impatience which he had kept repressed-
suddenly was rising to the surface of
mr jed conklin
  in fact im tellin yuh tuh mind yore
own business while yuhre here for yore
own good keep yore hands off this
town
  suppose we say well do as we damn
please drawled macdowei
  ho ho ho why you old fool
  it was a shout of laughter from the
shorter of the conklin henchmen as he
gave vent to those apparently hilarious
words he smote the taller man a mighty
blow on the back
  to daly it seemed that there had been
a lack of spontaneity in the laugh and
the taller man stumbled forward as
though the blow had been from a pile-
driver half by instinct and half because
of an idea which had suddenly assumed
form in his mind daly leaped toward
them
  the elevators of the de haviland of
course were hanging their rear edges
within inches of the ground the big
verona man was falling toward them
  daly covered the eight feet between
him and the stranger in one bound as
the oil mans heavy boot was coming down
on one elevator the flyers fist crashed to
the duke and the ducats

his jaw with all the momentum of his
leap plus the skill which was the result of
half a hundred fights
  the oil man staggered back his foot
brushing the linen of the control harm-
lessly
  you would would you daly snap-
ped coolly and another blow to the side
of the jaw felled the astounded texan
  why damn you-
  the smaller man had jumped at him
but daly jumped backward with catlike
quickness his colt was out before the
other mans
  dont anybody move came mac-
dowells vibrant voice
  his gun was out too trained on
conklin daly his gun on the smaller
henchman and his eyes on his fallen foe
spoke very clearly
  trying to make sure our shipll stay
on the ground by putting it out of com-
mission are you he inquired coolly
mr conklin this is a very interesting
party-
  what the hell do you mean put them
popguns up you squirts
  the faded little southwesterner was
suddenly boiling with rage his eyes were
snakelike and his leathery face was
working with emotion he could no longer
control
  what dyuh mean soakin that man
thataway he rushed on furiously by
god if you think yore uniforms is gonna
git you anything in this here town you
got another think cornin gun play you
want huh well blow the top o yore
heads off you-
  shut up
  it was macdowell he moved forward
lightly and clapped his hand oyer the
irate oil mans mouth
  listen here daly cut in steadily
his victim was still on the ground dazed
and the little fat man seemed entirely
nonplussed your two men here de-
liberately framed up a dodge to put our
ship out of commission maybe you
knew about it and maybe you didnt
it strikes me as a very peculiar thing for
a respectable citizen to come out here
threaten officers and warn them not to
interfere and put their official equipment
out of order we ought to carry the three
of you into town and put you in the
lockup for attempted destruction of
government property and interference
with officers of the law
  but we wont now were not here
on duty-supposedly but the property
this ship is standing on is protected by the
government right now and it starts
twenty feet from the ship on all sides
now get the hell off that property
fast
  for a fleeting second the southwest-
erner stood immobile his face a study in
baffled fury something in the dukes
passionless tones bound his tongue
though and he did not speak his eyes
shifted to the eyes of macdowell stand-
ing over him without a word he turned
and walked away from the ship
 come on you two daly said
tersely if the big boy cant walk carry
him fatty
  fatty supported his partner who was
not too dazed to mumble curses
  theres some news you might as well
spread called macdowell weve
arranged for a couple of guards and their
orders from now onll be to shoot anybody
that passes the dead line get that mr
conklin
  mr conklin did not answer as two
horsemen rode into the field he and his
henchmen rode away
  macdowell his eyes shining with the
zest of the battle lit a cigaret
  ive seen dumb things and peculiar
things and what have you he stated
but ill be damned if i ever saw any-
thing like this
  i cant get it at all daly admitted
great god tex no man could be such
a fool as to come right out and tip his
hand if he was up to something criminal
conklin comes right to us and warns us
in plain terms to keep out of things
any dumbbell in the world would know
that a man who did that was up to some-
thing illegal-and any dumbbell would
know too much to do it if he

thomson burtis
had any reason to be scared of the
law
  you might figure he acted in good
faith for the good of verona tex
ruminated lots of these towns dont
want law in the ordinary sense they
want women and booze and six-shooter
law
  but ill be damned if they try to de-
stroy government property and de-
liberately alienate officers of the law
  it might be that those two bozos
originated the idea themselves and the
big boy had little to do with it tex
suggested
  possible but not probable here are
the guards
  the two roughly dressed stubbled
bearded riders dismounted leisurely and
the heavier of the two inquired-
  macdowell and daly
  right youre the guards mr ivers
sent out
  yes suh
  both men were armed and looked
thoroughly competent for a job which
within the last few moments had assumed
importance
  know jed conklin daly asked
them
  shore do said the smaller man
wiping his mustache with the back of his
hand
  he just tried to put this ship out of
commission looks as though some
people in this town didnt want it to fly
so you may have work to do the orders
are this put up stakes in a circle twenty
feet away from the ship and shoot if any-
body tries to get closer youre guarding
government property now daly told
them quietly
  he was watching the guards closely
and they showed no signs of surprise
  thats funny the tall one said
ruminatively scratching his incipient
goatee must be this here elections
gonna be a humdinger
  darkness was falling and daly could
see no reason for questioning the guards
further when more information could be
obtained from ivers they were to use
the guards horses as they walked
toward them tex remarked
  thats a good ship there looks like
a robins cruiser to me notice the
liberty it is a cruiser
  daly nodded the ship was a heavy-
set thick winged model with space for two
passengers in the front seat the pilots
cockpit was the rear one
  shell do about what the dh will
wont she he inquired absently
  uh huh-a little more
  they mounted and as they were on
their way across the field tex remarked
i dont see why an election should
make it necessary for a ship to be put out
of order if we planned to interfere we
couldnt do any good in the air what
do you make of that watson
  who can tell whats up in a town like
this only ten miles from the river do
you figure furthermore that its a bit
peculiar for that man who was alongside
the ship when we were coming down to
disappear and fail to extend greetings to
his fellow flyers
  tex grinned blissfully
  probably all a pipe dream he
chuckled but it doesnt hurt to hope
that something might happen does it
weve made a great start one of the
powerful men of the town hates us al-
ready and weve got an unknown guy to
fight for the honor and money of the
family this election by all signs should
mean quite a fruity day tomorrow all in
all duke my boy im glad to be among
you
  the big texan was in his private idea
of the seventh heaven daly smiled his
eyes momentarily warm
  im not sorry he said evenly in
fact im not too sorry that this conklin
chap has got me thoroughly and com-
pletely bewildered he may be anything
from just a dunce to an outlaw so sure of
himself that he thinks he can run the
border patrol as well as verona
thatll probably be cleaned up in our
minds after we talk to ivers tex said
say wouldnt it be a joke if he was the
bozo who was rooking dad
the duke and the ducats

they struck the main trail-it
couldnot be called a road-half a
mile from the field it was choked
with traffic of all descriptions the two
lines moved at a snails pace except for
lone riders who galloped through the
mesquite the ruts were often a foot
deep wagons and trucks laden with
pipe and other equipment passenger cars
carrying scouts drillers and mechanics
tool pushers food trucks-all were part of
the line at intervals of a few hundred
yards other roads branched off to wells or
prospective wells on either side there
were many vehicles stuck in the sand
there was an effect of mighty effort and
sweaty industry the fact that the
swift texas darkness had fallen seemed
to make no difference to the throng of
workers before the night was over the
flyers were to make certain of the fact
that work in the verona field went on
twenty-four hours a day
  we dont seem to be too popular
daly observed
  right you are agreed tex as they ap-
proached the town listen to that
bozo
  one of a group of men riding a small
truck had called tauntingly-
  the reformers are with us
  many of the curious glances they re-
ceived were far from friendly some-
times what amounted to insults were
hurled at them from the protection of
darkness
  these roughnecks dont want their fun
spoiled daly commented they think
were the law
  as they came into the outskirts of the
town the feeling grew in strength on
each side of the road solid lines of pedes-
trians were moving toward town be-
tween lines of tents and shacks the two
flyers were conspicuous and even the
contained daly felt self-conscious as they
became the center of attention
  look at the boy scouts was a
favorite remark from the oil spotted
crudely dressed men on either side and
their passage down the street became a
long ordeal
  before it was over tex had a dangerous
glint in his eye and daly himself was
tightlipped and ready for trouble
  they havent even got electric lights
in most places yet tex observed as they
turned into the main street good
lord what a sight
  and daly agreed with him flaring
torches made the street as light as day
and flickering shadows in the background
lent it an air of spookiness the street
was solid with slow moving traffic the
roadbed a rough sea of ruts and sandy
bogs four lines of traffic barely moved
tents alternated with unpainted tem-
porary buildings and there were dozens
of other structures on which work was
progressing feverishly and everywhere
there were men-sliding between cars
choking the sidewalks so thick that there
was scarcely room for their feet from
either side there came music of every
known variety-hand organ mechanical
pianos personally operated violins and
guitars and a few portable organs
  most of these places are dives it looks
to me observed tex look at that
place
  it was a huge frame structure entirely
open on the street side inside it a huge
bar extended all along the right hand side
and ten bartenders were busy attending
to the mob which fought to get a place
close to the counter a good many tables
occupied the remainder of the front part
of the building and there were quite a few
women plainly hostesses helping oil men
to spend their money in the rear was a
small dance floor
 taunts some humorous and others
nasty were hurled continuously at the
flyers it was a seething tent city a
young raw giant bellowing to the night
sky daly felt a sense of surging life in
it and his heart beat faster anything
could happen there drunkenness a wild
abandon were in the very air the crowds
which he could look down upon included
every type of man from dirty roughneck
to well dressed big company scout and a
sprinkling of women
 every mexican gold digger from

thomson burtis
tampico north must have flocked here
he told tex
  there are more spigs than americans
-and there are a lot of em among the
men too
  they sure arent secret about their
good times daly said half to himself
look at this street
  almost every building and tent was
wide open on the street side some of
them were lighted with electricity others
by kerosene or gasoline and the solid line
of brightly illuminated squares gave a
carnival effect
   id like to see ten square feet of space
inside or outside with nobody occupying
it tex remarked look at that sign
cots ten bucks a night huh say if
ivers and dad dont clean up here i dont
know where they ever will lets ask
where the verona machinery equipment
co has its place of business
  he leaned down and asked a man in a
huge sombrero who was walking along-
side him pedestrians were in the street
passing between buildings everywhere
more than ever the town was like a
crowded circus lot even to many loud
ballyhoo artists
  the man looked up showing a face so
dark that he might have been a mexican
as he took in texs uniform his eyes
widened and a smile overspread his
countenance
  that big building-frame-on the
right hand side he said pointing
you are mr macdowell
  what asked the surprised tex as
the man hesitated do i know
you
  no
  he looked long at the two flyers grin-
ning as though at a private joke he
pushed his hat back on his head walking
along beside the horses his hair was
blond he was thin faced and lantern
jawed and his eyes sloped upward from
his nose giving his face a certain oriental
cast it was subtly cruel
  i knew mr ivers was expecting a
couple of flyers he said hope jyou
have a good time so long
  he turned and fought his way through
the crowd	if
  that bozo acted as though he was
enjoying our being here tex stated
maybe hes one of ivers men say
duke this town is the damnedest place i
ever hit a pilot runs away from meeting
us the next guy gets in a fight with us
two bozos try to wreck the plane and
the bunch in general would be far happier
if we werent here maybe im getting
nervous but this last gink the first one
to speak politely acted as though we
were the principal ingredient in a roman
holiday
  daly smiled briefly he had become
entirely anesthetic to the curious often
belligerent looks from the crowds and
the frequent razzings which came from
them
  he certainly was having a laugh to
himself looked as though he might be
a halfbreed you dont suppose ivers
confided in him do you
  well soon tell drawled tex swing-
ing off his horse
  the big two story building constructed
of unpainted boards had two small
windows and one door in its fifty foot
front painted on its front in crude letter-
ing was the name of the company on one
side of it was a huge square tent which
was a barroom and dance hall on the
other was a low flat roofed frame struc-
ture which was closed to the street
sounds of high revel came from it how-
ever and streams of men were passing in
and out its wide door
  they led their horses down the alley
alongside the ivers building there was
a platform for loading machinery toward
the rear of the building they tied their
horses and came around to go in the
front door
  a group of men were talking in the
small space in front of a counter in the
rear of the counter long lines of shelves
held all sorts of tools and further to the
rear heavy machinery could be seen-
pumps and other oil equipment
  where can we find mr ivers asked
tex
the duke and the ducats

  the six men looked the two flyers over
leisurely finally one of them jerked his
finger toward a stairway on one side
  upstairs he said briefly
  as they mounted the stairs daly heard
them whispering more or less excitedly
  we certainly do create attention he
told tex damned if im not beginning
to believe theres something more here
than meets the eye
  here we are stated macdowell
  at the front of the floor which was
mainly given up to the storage of
blankets cots and lighter equip-
ment was a partition which extended the
full width of the building there were
two doors one marked office it was
open and daly could see a very fat man
bending over a desk
  hello mr ivers tex said from the
doorway and the man turned around
ponderously
  he lumbered to his feet and shook
hands his fat face expanded in a smile
and his eyes receded to mere pinpoints as
the flesh gathered around them he was
bald headed and wore eyeglasses and
must have weighed a full three hundred
pounds duke thought he was six
feet tall at least and about that big
around
  this is mr daly tex introduced
them ivers grip was hard and firm
   well well its been fifteen years since
ive seen you lee ivers remarked as he
pulled a bottle from his desk and took out
some tumblers have a drink
  daly had a sudden shock as he saw
ivers in profile the fat jovial counte-
nance seemed to change his nose
curved slightly and his cheekbones were
very high he seemed almost with-
out eyes from the side too there
was strength and aggressiveness in his
profile
  as he turned to pass them the drinks
he was not smiling because of the layers
of fat around his eyes they gave the effect
of gray slits of light set very far back in
his head peering forth from protecting
flesh it was like another and vastly
different personality wearing that body
as a blind
  hes sure looking me over plenty
daly thought
  ivers was darting quick looks at him
constantly while talking personalities
with macdowell
  well mr ivers tex said finally
the duke here and i have our ears out
a foot to find out what the hells up and
why were here
  ivers leaned back in his chair his hands
folded over his huge paunch there was
silence in the barren office its only
furniture was the desk three straight
chairs and a filing cabinet from the
street came the ceaseless drone of the
milling crowds shot through with music
and ribald laughter and shouting daly
was quiet and at ease and he smoked a
cigaret with his eyes on the ceiling as he
felt ivers eyes boring into him
  well lee ivers said finally i
needed assistance because ive been a
business man all my life and i realize my
limitations first the general situation
you know pretty well this is unique
among oil towns because there was no
nucleus of a town here-no substantial
organized local element its a collection
of six or seven thousand hardbitten oil
men adventurers highjackers and thugs
both male and female thrown together
from half a dozen oil centers theres no
organization but there will be one to-
morrow in general its dog eat dog and
every man for himself
  he talks like an educated man daly
thought as he listened
  ivers voice was throaty almost wheezy
but his words were pronounced clearly and
correctly and with deliberation
  now then ivers went on i saw the
possibilities of the field before the first well
came in i laid my plans for this busi-
ness and got half of the capital from your
father when the first well hit i had a
fleet of trucks on the way machinery
shipped the next day and was installed
in this building almost before the world
knew there was a boom and a right tidy
business it is too there isnt a dollars

thomson burtis
worth of goods on these floors that isnt
sold and there are carloads on the way
that were sold before they were shipped
  i wasnt satisfied though i did
something i seldom do with your fathers
approval of course you know that he
and i have done business as partners and
opponents both for twenty-five years
the old hellion has beat me out of a for-
tune when we were against each other
i think he trusts my judgment however
i invested twenty-two thousand dollars
for us both in acreage all bought from
mexicans and negroes in small lots its
right here
  he took out a blueprint of the field
it was divided into a thousand areas
small and large and he pointed to a sec-
tion north east of town which was plainly
marked ivers acreage
  it looked good then and wonderful
now ivers continued the first well
derringer number  was a mile away
but the fault formation and all indica-
tions pointed to it being good stuff
derringer himself had corraled all the
acreage around his wildcat another well
was being sunk offset from our acreage
which was proving up since then-its
thomas number lhere-its come in for
ten thousand barrels of high grade oil
  right now this acreage leased at from
fifty to two hundred dollars an acre is
worth in round numbers from a thousand
an acre up there are wells in or looking
good all around it not thirty thousand
barrel ones but good ones i should say
your dads holdings and mine could be
sold tomorrow for a hundred thousand
  it does look as though you were a good
business man tex observed whats
the trouble
  just this as i said this acreage was
leased got on option and otherwise
secured from individual mexican and
negro farmers all ignorant now the
situation is this derringer-slats der-
ringer driller of the original well-had
scared and forced and bribed these twenty
small owners to swear that they were
forced by my agents to sell their leases-
coerced into deals they didnt want to
make every damn one of them has been
forced by derringer to repudiate their
agreements with me and to make new
ones at a slightly higher price with a small
percentage of the profits to him
  well ill be damned tex said softly
and looked at the immobile daly
  daly was listening closely but said
nothing
  you see where we are twenty-two
thousand sunk if those landholders
stick to their story the land will event-
ually belong to derringer and were
stuck hell fight forever and has he
money to do it the best that could
happen is to have it go years in the courts
-and everybody lose as far as profits
are concerned were tied tighter than a
drum by the time its settled even if
its in our favor well have spent thou-
sands the pool will probably be drained
and the oil under our property will have
seeped away and produced from offset
wells any way you take it were
stuck
  who is this derringer and how does
he get away with it asked daly
  there stated mr ivers impressively
is the nub of the whole proposition
hes the man weve got to tangle with
and beat
  he took out a stogie and lighted it
with deliberation he settled back in his
chir again and started talking directly
to daly
  slats derringer has been a big driller
for years-sometimes twenty rigs in a
field hes made a lot of money one way
or another and hes the smartest inde-
pendent oil operator this far south he
came in here from mexico and drilled
this wildcat he started tying up acre-
age before he brought her in when he
did that that was my cue to get ready
for business thats what i think of his
judgment
  no sooner had he hit oil than he
brought into this town about five hun-
dred men he knew most of em had
worked for him others were friends
he had roughnecks drillers dive keep-
ers-a derringer mob gathered from a
the duke and the ducats

dozen fields and former boom towns
hes got money himself and i think
two dallas men are backing him to the
limit there seems to be no limit to his
capital
  the result of all this is easy to see
before this town was well under way
derringer owned more than half the good
looking acreage bought for a song and
his organized mob growing every day
was running things weve got no
officials yet nominally but actually slats
runs the works he isnt particular about
how either if he wants machinery he
takes it pays for it although its price-
less at this time and asks the real owner
what the hell hes going to do about it
his friends own the principal dives-and
other saloon keepers are liable to find
their places of business wrecked if they
dont throw in on derringers side to-
morrow hell be elected chief cook and
bottlewasher of the town be the head of
the vigilantes or whatever the lawll be
and be officially in office he is the high 
muckymuck the political boss the rich-
est man the most active driller the
biggest owner of acreage and all the rest
of the works im telling you the truth
when i say that i have been forced to
give him machinery which was sold to
somebody else three times i tried to
hold out once-and that was enough
  he sounds drawled tex like what
might be called a worthy foeman
  and a crooked one hes the boy that
owns our acreage now naturally those
negroes and spigs are scared to death of
him there isnt a chance that theyll
ever throw in on our-the right-
side
  he aims to be the king of the field
eh asked daly
  exactly and he will be the big
companies are watching waiting a bit
longer for the field to prove itself before
stepping in and taking it over slats der-
ringer wants to be kingpin of a field in
full operation from pumping stations to
loading racks and to turn it over for a
healthy few million and retire i guess
he has ambitions to be a new oil king
and i guess he will be its a cinch that
hell take his pick of everything-and any-
thing he wants and cant get will be quite
a burden to its owner
  tex got to his feet as though im-
patient for action his brown hair
usually neatly parted was now down over
his eyes and he pushed it back
  well where do we come in
  in the first place theres no use right
now of even thinking of bucking der-
ringer there wouldnt be a chance i
am outwardly good friends with him
laughing off what hes done by the old oil
field motto of getting away with what
you can i acknowledge myself out-
witted so to speak and he is one of my
best customers of course any day how-
ever hell be around to take over this
business and hire me to run it for him
wait and see
  however i do think that we ought to
do this get at least a part of our legiti-
mate profit out of the acreage some
way or other and then sell it to him at
what we paid for it-which hes willing to
give and its worth a hundred thousand
that is hell give the original owners the
money if they need it to return your
father and me what we paid them
  he stopped talking and took a medi-
tative drag on his cigar
  i forgot to mention another string to
his bow he went on finally he also
owns the biggest gambling house in town
right next door here
  those impersonal eyes were suddenly
gleaming as they rested on the dukes
emotionless countenance
  he sure has got this town tied up
tex drawled
  that is he backs it ivers said a
gambler named draw one donnelly last
from smackover runs it for him oper-
ated in tia juana and havana before
hitting the oilfields but i know abso-
lutely that its derringers money hes
getting the dinero out of this field from
all directions
  well i dont know thats why
youre here when i give you proof of the
fact that derringer has openly robbed us

thomson burtis
of seventy-five thousand dollars prob-
ably youll agree with me that we neednt
be too honest about our own methods of
getting it back as a matter of fact hes
a crook every way even his gambling
games-when there are big players-are
crooked
  suddenly tex threw back his head and
laughed daly grinned and ivers per-
mitted himself a smile
  i know that from a friend of mine who
got taken for plenty when a man or
men new rich oil men or whoever they
may be are live wires who want to play
real poker with no limit theyre taken to
a private room where a house man
donnelly himself presides there are
always enough men to make up the game
two men-donnelly and a confederate
whom the sucker does not know is a con-
federate-are sure to be there if there
arent any other customers-and there
usually are a couple of supposed custom-
ers wander in theyre house men too
the net of the proposition is that any
man is playing against from two to four
men working together-raising and re-
raising each other and all that it wont
take you ten minutes with this tip to
discover the truth of it yourselves often
derringer himself takes a hand-he loves
poker hes as crooked as his house
whenever he isnt too busy he spends his
evenings that way
  he sure is a versatile boy tex said
thoughtfully
  surely is agreed ivers i thought
that perhaps you fellows might like to go
into the gambing house play a while and
look derringer over ive got a telegram
here from your father-he realizes that
we may have to spend money to get our
money back-saying that hell put up his
half of whatever amount i decide is
necessary well pretend that youre able
to lose plenty-and let you size up der-
ringer prove to yourselves hes a damned
crook and-
  say listen tex interrupted and the
silent daly could see he was afire with
excitement suppose we do that sup-
pose we prove to ourselves that hes a
crooked card player as well as a crook
every other way duke whats wrong in
our fighting fire with fire and crooking
him right back gjln there and play
square poker of course losing money
deliberately until were sure were being
rooked then go right back at em
  for a moment there was silence then
ivers leaned forward
  thats a possible idea he said
crisply and im calculating on risking
ten thousand dollars for my share my
check is good for twenty to make up
bills share maybe more-say fifteen
thousand a piece i dont know-
  if hes so powerful it seems like the
best way to me macdowell said slowly
after of course were dead certain that
were only fighting fire with fire
  there was a queer feeling within daly
for some reason he could not accept the
situation as anything but totally unreal-
a dream suddenly he leaned forward
  mr ivers would you be willing to
trust the playing of all that money to
tex and me
  ivers played with his watch chain and
did not look up as he replied
  his father thinks tex a fine poker
player and you have that reputation-
from whom
  ivers raised his eyes daly was tense
from tex originally and from his
father to me
  daly relaxed slightly then ivers did
not know that he had been forced into
crooked gambling years before by an
older man when starvation was close
upon him and that he had been one of
the most successful of the card men be-
cause of his youth and breeding then
he laughed at himself how could ivers
know anything like that
are these them army officers
-a it was a voice from the door-
way a tall very thin very
hard looking man his blond hair-tousled
and his chin covered with a thin beard
was standing there his hard gray eyes
rested on ivers
  yes iversanswered studying theman
the duke and the ducats

  i got a note for you the stranger in-
formed the flyers and handed it to daly
who was nearest hun
  it was brief and wthe point
     mind your own business and dont interfere
   with anything while youre in this town as
   long as you do that youll be all right
  daly handed it to ivers his eyes on the
messenger as the man started to go
daly jumped forward he spun the
stranger around and their faces were very
close together
  who sent that note he demanded
evenly
  i was told not to tell grinned the
man impudently
  but you will tell-now
  the roughneck pushed his hair back
from his eyes his gimlet eyes gleamed
with sardonic mirth as he repeated
mockingly
  no i wont tell-now none of my
business im jest a messenger
  dalys mind was made up in a split
second what was on the schedule for
verona during the next twenty-four hours
he did not know he did know that he
resented personally and officially the
attitude of verona toward himself and
tex and that the more they knew the
better they would be off
  again the bearer of the threat turned
to go a mocking grin on his bony face
daly tight lipped but self-controlled
spun him around again
  hey who do you think- the man
started nastily but he stopped suddenly
  a colt was pressed against his shoulder
and dalys gray eyes were not easy to
look into
  youre going to tell what you know
right now daly said with an equanimity
which was more venomous than rage
would have been youre going to do it
within thirty seconds if you dont im
going to shoot you right through that
shoulder of yours if you dont tell then
youre going to be taken to laredo and
sweated until you do youre not going
to get out of this room alone this may
be verona but were not afraid of you or
your boss now damn you think while
i count ten
  daly was utterly sincere and he left
no doubt of what he meant to do ivers
was as though paralyzed tex standing
behind daly said nothing
  slowly daly counted the mans
cockiness disappeared like magic he was
like a rat in a trap
  as the count reached five very slowly
his eyes remained frozen to dalys at
seven his mouth was open and there was
desperation in his eyes at nine the in-
exorable daly mouth a thin cruel line
was snarling the word down into his
face
  at ten i shoot he said quietly and
here goes
  dont shoot
  the mans nerve broke
  it was jed conklin and barny
opper he half shouted they told me
to bring it here
  why do you know talk
  the man looked as though he had
started to pet a house cat and it had
turned into a lion
  jed conklin ivers said slowly
whats he up to
  i dont know the man said earnestly
except that theres somethin up
tomorrow demanded tex
  no tonight does that satisfy you
thats all i know lemme go now huh
id git killed by barny opper if he knew
i told-
  go ahead daly told him and the
man left head down in humiliation
  couldnt depend on the truth of what
he said anyhow daly commented
easily i guess i did the right thing
mr conklin it appears had important
plans afoot and our safety is none too
sure tex know him mr ivers
sure ivers said absently he got up
and began pacing the floor thoughtfully
hes derringers only rival and about
half as strong he wants to run the town
too he hasnt got a chance derringer
has stolen his stuff and fought him tooth
and nail to drive him to the wall jed
you might say represents the better

thomson burtis
element although nobody likes him
nasty chap-
  hes sure acting very funny tex
remarked as though he was going to
pull off a big job listen to this
  as tex told briefly the events of the
afternoon which concerned conklin ivers
stood motionless his fat legs spread
widely and his face without a trace of ex-
pression the flesh seemed to fold more
tightly around his eyes however until
that impression of a stranger looking forth
from the flesh which disguised him became
more powerful than ever
  when macdowell had finished ivers
scratched his head absently daly
thought that he was much more im-
pressed than he seemed to be before
saying a word he made one slow turn of
the room his head down in thought
  jeds got something up his sleeve
sure as hell he said finally in that
throaty wheeze he seemed to be trying
to digest the possibilities in the situation
of course most of this town dont give
a damn there are two organized mino-
rities-derringers and jeds derrin-
gers is stronger the rest of the townll
just be satisfied with whatever happens
jed aims to have things happen this way
hes got a coup prepared and he wants
no law in the shape of patrolmen or any
other brand of it well ill be damned
so the little roosters laid a trap of some
sort-
  he ceased talking and resumed his
walk daly thought that he was con-
siderably exercised over the situation for
a man who had little interest one way or
the other
  of course he has-he hates der-
ringer he reminded himself aloud he
said
  funny situation isnt it here you
hate derringer and were planning to rook
him plenty at the same time were in
a sort of feud with our principal ally
although he doesnt know it
  ivers nodded his fleshy face blank
well he said abruptly lets get
set on this poker business
  he sat down but his heart did not
seem to be in the project as it had been
  just for your own information he
said absently here are the papers show-
ing bill and i the legal owners of this
acreage within ten or fifteen minutes
youll find the game crooked thats
certain
 daly and tex examined the papers
casually there was no doubt of their
genuineness
  now ivers said how do you plan
to work things as i said im a babe in
arms along that line although ive
played a little small poker inasmuch as
youre going to be playing with ten
thousand dollars of mine im naturally
interested in the modus operandi
  duke noted that latin phrase mr
henry ivers was evidently a man of
parts he was becoming more and more
interested in the past of this merchant of
the frontier who betrayed education and
experience aside from that gained in such
places as the yukon and the texas
border
  macdowell looked over at daly and
ivers eyes also seemed to gravitate in the
direction of the slim blond young man
with the youthful face
  i think wed better forget crooked
stud dealing daly said evenly except
as an occasional thing it would spoil
our draw game to sit side by side and
perhaps i can get away with an occasional
stud hand unassisted now on draw wed
better have at least three sets of signals
change them every ten hands and per-
haps we can get away with our share of
the boodle if theres an innocent outsider
in the game well return his money
afterward
  he described the signals in detail and
for fifteen minutes various matters which
might arise were taken up henry ivers
sat there immobile and expressionless
but his eyes were very bright
  well he said finally getting up from
his chair lets get you boys a quick bite
to eat and then let you go to it while
youre eating ill fix up a twenty thousand
dollar credit-no i believe ill make it
thirty thousand that games liable to
the duke and the ducats

be very big what a dumb-bell i am-i
never thought of this dodge-and bill
talking about lees poker playing for
four years
a half hour later ivers got them at
the hot dog stand where they had
 eaten and was escorting them
into the door of donnellys facing the
door and only ten feet from it was a long
bar with four bartenders at work at one
end of it there was a door and over the
low partition dividing the shallow bar-
room from the rear there came the never
ending unmistakable sound of many men
gambling waiters were very busy
purveying to the back room
  ivers led them through the door
dalys eyes took in the scene quickly
there were at least twenty-five tables
scattered over the huge structure each
in charge of a house man with an eye-
shade over his eyes klondike twenty-
one roulette stud and draw poker faro
keno-all were there in the rear of the
room two huge green crap tables were
surrounded by a throng of men in the
center of the room a barred cashiers cage
held three men-one cashier and two
guards both armed with sawed off shot-
guns as well as revolvers
  youll play upstairs ivers told
them heres donnelly now see that
man standing by the crap tables-the
tallest one thats derringer i think
hell play with you if he has time
mr donnelly this is mr macdowell and
mr daly
  duke daly had seen a thousand of
donnellys type he was of medium
height slightly bald carefully dressed
and his smooth fleshy face held a
speciously genial smile while cool black
eyes mirrored no emotion whatever his
grip was neither strong nor weak he
looked like a carefully groomed denizen
of a city underworld his mouth was full
lipped and bracketed in two very deep
wrinkles
  ive heard of your father he told
macdowell glad to know you mr
ivers here has said that he stands be-
hind you for any amount and i guess you
want a real game eh
  his smile seemed to convey admiration
for two real gamblers
  thats us tex said with a grin
weve got some money and crave
action
  we have a private room upstairs
donnelly told them over there is mr
derringer hes willing to play-one of
the wealthiest men in town-and a rich
little lease hound named dave harris who
likes a good game im going to play
myself to fill out the game and because
i crave action personally
  again that wide oily smile which did
not change those hard eyes daly felt
the fundamental coldness and calculation
in the man
  of course he went on with apparent
frankness our usual house cut of five
per cent deducted from all stacks bought
will be in order thats mild for this
racket dont you think
  daly nodded donnelly seemed to be
talking mostly to him despite the fact
that he had said nothing his eyes
rested persistently on the duke as though
trying to figure him out it was almost as
though he sensed a familiar something
about him which puzzled him daly
thought back to the old days and was
certain however that he had never run
across mr draw one donnelly possibly
donnelly had seen him however or
heard of him the change in the flyers
face due to the operation frequently
puzzled people who had known him
well
  lets go up suggested donnelly
ill get slats and dave right now
  im leaving you ivers said ill be
in my office when you get through sure
derringer is going to play eh well
good luck
  he smiled a very wide and beaming
smile and waddled out of the noisy
smoke filled room
  we play against three daly said in
low tones as donnelly went after der-
ringer theyll be doing a whole lot of
raising just on their weight of money

thomson burtis
against us it looks like never quitting
on good hands for us always providing
ivers was right
  tex nodded both had their eyes on
derringer who was walking toward
them he was taller even than mac-
dowell who was six feet two and his
lank body was slim and bony looking
his face was long and thinthe brow high
and craglike over deep set fierce looking
eyes his bold nose curved over a thin
almost lipless mouth and his cheeks were
so hollow that his face was merely
leathery skin stretched tightly over the
protruding bones his iron gray hair
grew to a point over his forehead and it
stood straight up in a high pompadour
like a topknot
  his piercing blue eyes darted quick
glances at the two flyers and he shook
hands with crisp strength
  glad to know you he said tersely
his voice deep and harsh i may not be
able to play long but others will happen
in i hate to break up a game
  davell be right up donnelly in-
formed them and led the way up narrow
stairs
he second floor room was de-
voted exclusively to card games
all played with silent intentness
these evidently were big players they
were of various types but leaned mostly
to older men whose clothing subtly indi-
cated their higher positions in the ver-
ona scheme of things daly thought that
most of them were owners or technical
men he did not see one man who looked
like a roughneck or small salaried tool
pusher or driller
  the room which they were to use was
not a room really-it was rather one of
a series of alcoves separated from each
other by rude partitions the side toward
the main room was wide open
  harris arrived as they were sitting
down he was a small consumptive
looking jew with oily black hair and a
tremendous hooked nose he was dressed
in blue serge and his eyes were almost
always on the ground he was self-
possessed and his movements were quick
as a cat
   hes got every mark there is of an ex-
perienced croupier daly thought
  on a sidetable donnelly set a rack of
chips
  whats you gentlemens idea of the
original take-out he inquired his
fleshy face became more round as he
grinned lets make it a real game eh
two thousand stacks
  ok daly found himself saying
and i should say a two thousand dollar
limit at the outside-or table stakes
  table stakes rasped derringer
  the chips were counted out as they sat
down tex and daly took chairs in the
positions they had arranged between
themselves donnelly was on dalys
right and harris on his left to harriss
left was derringer and tex was between
the oil man and donnelly
  one thing we might settle daly said
quietly ivers guarantees our payment
of course what i mean is do we get paid
off in cash
  absolutely you fellow donnelly
assured him with that pretended blithe-
ness derringer permitted himself a
wintry grin harris was expressionless
his hands playing with his chips stacking
them and restacking them with lightning
like speed what do you think we have
those guards for theres more than a
hundred thousand dollars cash in this
house tonight and itll be a lot more be-
fore long
   as the first deal started five men took
seats at a table in front of the alcove a
house man with them who dealt nothing
but stud
   daly settled down to the ferocious con-
centration which was one of the reasons
why he was a poker player who seldom
if ever lost against the average compe-
tition the others were silent too
  he watched every hand like a hawk
he wondered how much to lose if the
game was crooked before finally deciding
that it was it so happened that he broke
even in the first seven hands-and that
they told the tale
the duke and the ducats

  on the second hand he went in with
three tens drawing two cards don-
nelly had opened for fifty dollars and
drew one card derringer had stayed
and also drew one donnelly bet a hun-
dred dollars and daly raised a hundred
derringer re-raised two hundred and
donnelly promptly re-raised a full five
hundred dollars-practically his stack
  might as well find out now as any
time cheap daly thought and called
  as derringer threw his hand into the
deck daly as though by accident thrust
his hand forward and the cards fell face
up a four card flush
  sixes and fours donnelly said sourly
as daly showed his threes
  heavy raising and re-raising on noth-
ing believing id surely lay down my
threes against two raising one card
draws thought daly
  tex looked at him questioningly per-
haps because he was ultrasensitive daly
did not give the signal to start their own
scheme of play on the seventh hand
however assurance was made doubly
sure
  this time it was tex who stuck stub-
bornly on kings and eights against the
raising and re-raising of three three-card
draws until his stack disappeared as he
called a final seven hundred dollar raise
on derringers part the other two who
had been apparently so strong dropped
  derringer had just a pair of jacks
  cant bluff a thing in this game he
rasped
  no thought duke not with us
knowing your racket but when you boys
start getting some good hands or if we
didnt know what you were up to how
youd clean us
  he glanced at tex and nodded the
crooked battle was on
  during the first half dozen hands after
that there was little action neither he
nor tex had anything to speak of one
way or another on the seventh hand it
was the dukes deal tex signaled a
small pair daly himself had a pair of
kings no one opened so daly did for
twenty-five dollars
  harris and derringer both stayed
which surprised daly somewhat tex
knew what he had to do it was a hand
where by sheer weight of money between
them they could probably win on
nothing
  raise it fifty drawled tex just on
prospects
  dalys eyes narrowed when donnelly
stayed he and tex were playing against
three men he had caught none of their
signals yet probably they were planning
to do again the same thing he and tex
were-win by weight of combined money
  knowing im best to go in daly said
calmly i re-raise two hundred dollars
  harris and derringer had passed open-
ing the pot but stayed for the raises
  macdowell his big body radiating his
utter absorption in the situation and his
joy in it surveyed his cards carefully
then
  this hand of mine is going to be
worth everything or nothing he an-
nounced with a grin i tilt her five
hundred
  same here big boy said donnelly
with that specious smile and put in his
stack
  literally thousands of hours of poker
often played under conditions where his
life itself was at stake if he slipped had
given the duke an uncanny intuition
where cards were concerned his mind
miraculously cool and clear as it always
was in emergencies was working with
smooth detached speed
  harris might pass under the gun he
reflected you cant figure derringer
would pass a second hand if he had any-
thing good donnelly was next to last-
he wouldnt pass anything above a pair
certainly theyre ganging up on us
again as sure as hell on nothing
  he looked at his cards calmly harris
eyes were on the table derringer was
showing a wolfish joy in the game his
piercing eyes concentrating on dalys
face donnelly was sitting back in
elaborate ease
  you fellows are playing a lot of un-
filled straights and four card flushes he
thomson burtis
said casually and ill be damned if you
draw against my little openers for nothing
here goes my stack if you want to draw
there was more than  in the pot
and he thought the raise the correct
strategy there could be no more betting
after the draw-all stacks would be ex-
hausted and it was table stakes
  harris threw in his cards as did der-
ringer and tex daly tensed as donnelly
stayed
  how many he asked
  there was no use of disguising his hand
donnelly had passed next to last man
and betting was over- daly took three
  three myself and i still have what
i went in with-a pair of aces
  daly silently laid down a pair of kings
you win and a good hand at that
he said evenly
  he avoided meeting macdowells eyes
donnelly had stood all that raising and
re-raising for big money on a pair of aces
it was too uncanny to believe almost
or else donnelly was the poorest poker
player alive he couldnt have played
more perfectly if he had known what
dalys hand was
 and of course the cards arent
marked daly thought fiercely as he
said calmly
  i think ill take a five thousand dollar
stack this time
  in three more hands signals would
change did those men by any possi-
bility know the signals between tex and
himself they were using fingers to
signal their hand-pair two pairs threes
straight and so on and voice inflections
to indicate the value of the combinations
  the next three hands produced nothing
sensational the table was a pool of
silence amid the drone of the room the
five men at the next table before the
door were a bit more noisy than any one
else
  daly smelled a rat somewhere that
donnelly play was unbelievable after
the signals changed to eyes and a method
of folding up cards after looking at them
he felt more confidence twice during
the next few hands the three verona
gamblers bet fairly high against mediocre
hands on the part of the airmen but no
signals could be detected
  then there came a hand with mac-
dowell dealing on which tex signaled
three queens before the draw donnelly
opened daly raised on nothing to help
make a pot for tex harris re-raised five
hundred dollars macdowell hesitated
and finally just stayed
  up one thousand donnelly an-
nounced his eyes darting around the
table 
  daly dropped as did harris and mac-
dowell stayed donnelly drew two cards
and tex the same number macdowells
eyes rose from his cards and gazed long
at the ceiling while he meditatively blew
a smoke ring-two of them he had
caught a small pair for a queen full
  check donnelly snapped and mac-
dowell bet a thousand dollars
  good donnelly said viciously and
threw his cards into the deck
  openers daly said earnestly and
turned the hand
  donnelly had thrown down three aces
against a two card draw on a not un-
usual sized bet for that game
  that poker is too smart for me daly
thought slowly and he could fairly feel
macdowells eyes burning into him
these birds know our signals
  he did the thing agreed upon between
tex and himself in case they should want
to change them in an emergency he
borrowed a cigaret from the southerner
four hands after their change in signals
the three verona men tangled with them
and when the storm had blown over tex
and daly had lost four thousand dollars
between them forcing two pairs-and
they had lost to aces up in harris hand
once again the poker was too uncanny
  that was a ringtailed snorter daly
remarked without emotion im going
to stretch my legs and get a drink before
the next hand deal me out if you want
to
  i think ill imbibe one myself
drawled tex anybody else
  oh slats i want to see you a minute
the duke and the ducats

   it was a short stalwart man in puttees
breeches and an oilstained hat derringer
went aside with him while the two flyers
went downstairs to the bar mac-
dowell was furious	i
  they know our signals daly said
shortly
 of course they do that means that
henry ivers told em he got us into
this-why the son of a gun worked it so
that we suggested it ourselves it
means-
may mean several things daly cut
in incisively we cant stay away too
long were ten thousand out between us
there must be a way to get these
birds tex interrupted savagely
  we can try this and quit when were
even if we feel like it there might be a
big pot if were in luck before they get
wise listen
  it took but a few seconds to explain
they were back at the table within two
minutes and daly announced easily
well weve had a council of war and
we decided we couldnt make money
without money how about eight thou-
sand more apiece mr donnelly
  there speaks a man after my own
heart donnelly chuekled his fat face
beaming with artificial geniality fif-
teen thousand each and everything is
hotsy totsy how about the rest of us
getting our stacks even eh ive got
more than that myself dave youre
not up to that and neither are you
slats
  all agreed while the duke thought-
  all set for bigger killings
while the chips were being count-
ed another man entered and called
derringer aside for a talk for a
moment derringer seemed to hesitate
then-
  ill play a few more hands and then
ill be there he said harshly
  daly studied him curiously that
hawklike face was as rugged as a bleak
cliff tall and thin and bony there
was a sort of natural ferocity under
iron control obvious in him he was
playing with wolfish enjoyment in the
game
  during the next three hands it became
more obvious that the three were playing
together if more evidence was needed
when they were in a pot together without
either flyer in it they played without
interest and called the first small bet on
good hands they had no interest in
winning
  on the fifth hand after the interruption
daly opened his cards warily his face
did not change in the slightest as he
looked down at an ace full the time had
arrived
  he signaled tex a pair of queens using
the first system of signals the new set
which their three opponents could not
possibly know indicated his real hand
tex signaled nothing by both systems
the verona men figured that one pair was
all they had between them
  it was harris deal and derringer
luckily opened tex raised him one
hundred dollars
  theyll figure were off on a raise and
re-raise thing or nothing and will be out
to get us daly assured himself his
heart was pounding his eyes though
had that film dropped across them and
his face never changed
  donnelly just stayed and daly raised
five hundred harris and derringer
came in
  theyre set to take our bluff daly
thought and as he darted a look at
macdowell that towering gentleman was
a picture of utter bliss
  he re-raised and it went on daly and
macdowell doing all the reraising until
each man had put four thousand dollars
into the pot it was time to strike and it
was harris who did it after a look at
donnelly
  ive just been sitting around saying
nothing on the best hand he mumbled
now she really goes up for them that
wants to draw here goes my stack
  it wasnt quite his stack but it was
enough to exhaust the four thousand odd
dollars which the flyers had in front of
them

thomson burtis
  good poker daly thought to him-
self that would stop us if we had
nothing
  derringer stayed macdowell dropped
regretfully and donnelly stayed assur-
ing the table that he was sorry he couldnt
raise forever
  heres mine daly said quietly and
he could see their faces mirror utter
amazement
  his hand won after the draw without
competition the highest hand between
the three which was shown was harris
openers-kings and threes-and they
had staked twenty-four thousand dollars
between them
  macdowell lighted a cigaret and
hummed a little tune his eyes were
pools of light the pot had put the air-
men more than ten thousand to the good
net
  daly was tense watching the taut
players like a hawk they were com-
pletely baffled they must realize that
their game was gone probably unless
they just had better luck they no longer
knew the signals of their opponents
what would be the next move
  during the next two hands there was
none the table was silent as the grave
each man playing as though life itself was
at stake the stud players at the next
table were growing noisier
  donnelly all traces of joviality gone
now shuffled the cards he shoved
them to tex to cut
  the hell i did shouted a man at the
next table
  as donnelly picked up the cut cards a
huge roughly dressed player rose to his
feet
  ill cut your heart out he shouted
and table and chips crashed to the floor
  in a second there was a wild melee
while the rest of the room watched for just
an instant dalys eyes like every ones
else was on the battle immediately
however his mind was back on the game
he did not look around but unless he was
badly mistaken there was at least an even
chance that draw one donnelly had
switched decks in the excitement he
thought he had seen something from the
corner of his eyes
  got a cold deck to use in emergen-
cies daly thought swiftly
  the battle was over in a moment the
men left amid the hoots of the onlookers
  it was staged daly reflected
  he was on his feet helping pick up
chips he caught macdowells eye and
the texan came over to him
  i think they switched decks daly
said swiftly play it maybe we can
figure something and if we cant ill have
donnelly searched if we have to pull
guns
  after a moment of general excitement
the room was quiet again and they went
back to the table
  just a bunch o drunks donnelly
said well here we go boys you cut
them macdowell
  complete quiet settled over the alcove
it was a world of its own daly had never
looked at a poker hand with such burning
interest as he did at these five subtly fresh
feeling cards which he opened
  he was looking at three kings a six
and a seven he was thinking
  if its a cold hand they wont dare be
too crude the handsll be completed on
the draw
  he looked at tex the southener was
signaling a ten full he had a pat hand
instantly dalys mind was made up
but which man was to beat them and
did he have his hand pat
  pass he said briefly
  there was no surprise on the part of
any one he was first under the gun
harris passed as did derringer
  it wouldnt be donnelly whod beat
us it would be one of the others hes
dealing daly thought
  tex opened for a hundred dollars
donnelly studied his cards regretfully
he passed one man out daly raised
it five hundred dollars harris stayed
and derringer dropped
  the thin little jew eyes on the f table
and hands playing ceaselessly with his
cards smoked his cigaret in nervous
puffs never had daly felt such mounting
the duke and the ducats

excitement in a card game the
players were stooped over the table and
derringer especially seemed as though
he were drawn to the game by terrific
magnetic attraction which would not let
him leave although he should want to
the clatter of the crowded room the noise
from below the drone of the swarming
streets-all were forgotten by the young
flyer as he mapped out his plan of
campaign
  tex macdowell was right on the spot
  derringers leaving its getting late
so lets make this pot a good one he
drawled his voice vibrant up a
thousand
  and two daly said unemotionally
  harris opaque black eyes darted
toward donnelly
  i aint backin down he said huskily
and five if thats the way you feel
  macdowell studied his cards
  i dont mind admitting ive got all im
ever going to get he said nonchalantly
ill just stay i guess
  not me the size of your stack
harris said the duke
  harris threw away his cigaret and
lighted another in two lightning like
movements
  ok
  daly looked over at macdowell did
the texan plumb his plan of course he
would stay he must-
  he did
 the duke pushed his chair back
slightly his eyes were on donnelly
there were two possibilities in harris
hand one that he had an unbeatable
pat hand and had passed in the full
knowledge that tex would open this
seemed scarcely believable there was
no object in disguising his hand and it
would be suspicious for the second player
to pass up a pat hand for a raise it
seemed more likely in every way that he
had a hand he would have to fill
  i was just taking a ride daly said
easily his eyes on donnellys pasty face
  with a quick movement he thrust his
hand into the deck he had not been the
opener
  give me five cards
  donnellys mouth sagged open and his
face seemed to go a greenish white
there was a grunt from derringer as
though somebody had hurt him cruelly
and he was trying to disguise his pain
harris eyes raised and they glittered
like a snakes a sigh escaped him it
was as though the table was surrounded
by images each eye concentrated on the
blond young man from whose sculptured
face there looked forth those eyes of long
experience and cold competence
  deal em donnelly he said in low
tones and his right hand was at his side
where the army holster swung
  donnelly for the moment was not the
experienced gambler his hand shook
without removing his eyes from dalys
he slowly dealt five cards
  one whispered harris
  he scarcely bothered to look at it
  stand pat stated texr on a ten
full
  daly looked at his cards the blood
was running hot through his veins the
next move he knew not but across the
table was the man who from all the
world he would have picked to be by his
side in an emergency like this
  his first two cards were the fourth king
and nine of hearts then there was the
ace of hearts he knew he had won
had he drawn but one card to his threes
he would have filled and the nine of
hearts would have filled the bottom of
harris open end straight flush if he
drew two harris would have got the ace
of hearts which would also have filled
his hand
  take all the money harris said as
though baffled
  the table was looking at daly as
though he were some freak of nature
their knowledge of the plot showed
plainly-they did not notice tex as
that gentleman scooped in the money-
fifteen thousand dollars of it from their
enemies-dalys eyes roved to der-
ringers there was what amounted to
chilly admiration there
  but not in donnellys it seemed that
thomson burtis
there was murder in those murky depths
so daly wasted no time he pushed back
his chair a little more
  donnelly and the rest of you-you
know were wise he said very slowly and
coolly no monkey business from now
on this game is over here and now
youve been outcrooked i saw you
switch decks now listen
  he leaned forward and his hand un-
obtrusively was on the butt of his gun
silence was like a wet fog over the
table
  cash in our chips now and in cash
you dont dare monkey with us there
are a lot of people on the outside-and
outside of verona-who know what were
here to do if you make one false move
your gambling dump is going on the fritz
right tonight ill tell everybody in the
place about it and have it out of business
tomorrow if theres anything more
ugly than just cheating you and your
place and your friends are going to be
blown to hell tomorrow get that now
you call somebody and you get us our
money pronto or youll be searched for
proof within one minute publicly and
worse than that will happen in twenty-
four hours
  im not getting tough im telling
you before you tell me something
  im leaving i have no idea what this
is all about it was derringers harsh
voice ill settle tomorrow he went on
gruffly and walked out of the alcove as
though leaving something very unpleasant
behind him
  for a long moment donnelly sat there
the duke felt that he could watch his
mind like a rat in a trap doubling and
redoubling trying to find a way out
then so suddenly that it was a shock
the fleshy gambler relaxed and that false
smile spread over his face
  you won and won right and you get
your money he said with his grin
widening there was no trace of shame
on his face
  daly scarcely knew why but he had a
feeling that donnelly felt that it was a
loan
a moment later he and tex were
leaning against the alcove close
-	together they had allowed don-
nelly to go down after the money finally
the duke was certain that it would be
forthcoming
  duke my hand tex whispered as
they supposedly watched the room did
we rook em and how say derringer
hasnt left yet what are we going to do
with the dough
  inasmuch as its a dead cinch that
henry ivers is as crooked as a cork-
screw daly said evenly his eyes on the
tall oil man who was conversing earnestly
in a corner
  i cant believe it tex said slowly
somebody may have been listening in in
that warehouse when we were talking to
henry
  hed have been in the room behind the
office then and howd he get there with-
out ivers knowing about it
  macdowells tanned face was suddenly
set in grim lines
  boy how he worked it he said
didnt suggest it himself-but we fell
for his trap doublecrossing dad eh and
getting us down here to lose twenty thou-
sand or so besides all that he and der-
ringer are rooking the old man out of in
other ways he ruminated slow venom
in his voice if its true and it sure looks
it what a frame up it is maybe to give
the old boy credit this slats derringer
has something on him and forced him
to cooperate hank and dad buy acreage
on a gamble and then ivers plays der-
ringers hand and lets or helps derringer
lie it up now that its valuable they
take no chance if it wasnt-and take no
chance of losing the acreage now that its
valuable why that old skinflint is
probably embezzling from the business
too-shooting machinery to derringer
giv ing him all the breaks fooling with the
books-everything and to cap it off
he gets us down here to lose thousands
more of the old mans good dough-
  it strikes me that wed better fly that
money out of this town pronto daly
said quietly now the excitement of the
the duke and the ducats

battle he had loved gone he was as aloof
as though discussing the spending of ten
dollars i wonder about ivers guards
for the ship
  here comes donnelly-with the
dinero tex whispered
  the gambler had in his hands a small
bag
  come back here he told them and
took them into a small room the watch-
ful flyers had counted out for them win-
nings of more than twenty-five thousand
dollars
  wed better buy the bag grinned
macdowell how much donnelly
  take it with my compliments don-
nelly smiled back it was a mere widen-
ing of the lips
  so long many thanks-and dont have
us fooled with tex warned him weve
got a visit to make and it isnt far from
here until we get there our hands wont
stray far from these colts-
  good god duke donnelly want
to get out what the hell is coming off
  daly leaped to the door beside the
amazed macdowell a stream of men
were erupting from the stairway and at
their head was jed conklin the faded
eyes of the leathery irascible little texan
were alight with an almost fanatical
glow behind him heavily armed men
were disposing themselves around the wall
of the big room
  dont nobody be scared-you know
me-but dont make no wrong moves
neither
  the dozens of gamblers sat as though
petrified there was no fear in their
faces-rather a dazed interest in the pro-
ceedings donnelly brushed by the
flyers and stood in front of the door
over across the room slats derringer was
motionless as a statue daly his level
eyes sweeping the room felt that the
lantern jawed oil operator loomed like a
giant even in tljat crowd
  conklin was like a small gamecock
with his sombrero on the back of his head
and his small body fairly quivering with
nervous eagerness
  listen all o you he proclaimed
im here to get slats derringer out o the
way for tomorrow and then return im
im electioneerin if you want t put it
that way and im speakin my piece all
around town and doin other things in the
bargain
  he caught sight of donnelly and bowed
mockingly
  evenin draw one he said with
elaborate sarcasm youre due for a
little vacation from these parts slats
dont you make a move or ill have you
hogtied in three seconds lessn nothin
ive got about three hundred o yore plug
uglies where they wont do no harm fur a
day or so and dont forgit that
  lets get out of his sight daly
whispered and hear whats going on
  it was like a dream those armed men
around the walls evidently conklin
had taken the downstairs part of the
house without a struggle the stairs
were packed with curious gamblers from
the lower floor and from without the
noise of the mob was growing louder
  now git this everybody conklin
went on pacing up and down in the
center of the room none of you care
much about who runs this here town one
way or the other you all know that
slats derringers been runnin it havin
more men more acreage and more

im givin this town a physic t clean it
out y dont want martial law like there
was in mexia here do you boys y dont
want rangers runnin the town do you
i even went so far as t warn them
border patrolmen t keep hands off-
leastways until they knowed-
  daly tensed as the sound of a fusillade
of shots came from the street sud-
denly there was a great deal of shouting
in a moment the noises of a mighty battle
came washing against the building
  for a moment conklin seemed thunder-
struck suddenly derringer was on his
feet
  well see how much you can get away
with he shouted ill cram every one
o your insults down your throat jed
conklin got my men have you
thats them outside
  come on boys conklin yelled
out o the way on them stairs
in an instant the conklin forces
which had accompanied him were
plunging down the steps there was
unmistakable evidence from without that
the struggle was a gargantuan one it
seemed that the whole main street must
be engaged shouts curses occasional
shots breaking glass and all the din of a
rough and tumble battle were plainly
audible
macdowells eyes were alight with glee
conklin and derringer are going to
fight it out right now he breathed
say duke ivers must have tipped off
derringer
  sure what do we do now the duke
asked absently tex there isnt a thing
we can do our job is to save this
dinero right now-and talk to ivers
what our job is a little later i dont know
what may be going on with this town as
a center may interest the government
very much lets see this window itll
be as much as our life is worth to go out
the front door
  the tiny window was about fifteen
feet off the ground
  ill go down on our belts and you can
drop and ill catch you tex suggested
and in a minute their two belts tied to-
gether and dangling from the sill he was
going down he dropped to the ground
daly released the belts and then dropped
into the texans arms
  listen to that daly said with what
was almost awe in his voice
  the street battle was an epic guns
were not in use now but the thorough-
fare was a solid mass of heaving bodies
everybody had joined in it seemed it
was a battle royal and verona was a
madhouse some dives were being looted
it seemed as a sideline to the fight for
supremacy
  derringer either didnt take ivers
the duke and the ducats

warnings seriously or else conklin struck
too unexpectedly daly surmised
slats wanted to leave the game but
couldnt it seemed to me he must have
thought he had everything arranged i
guess conklins got some of his leading
henchmen out of the way but derringer
has enough organized opposition left to
make it interesting
  as they stole around the corner of the
ivers storehouse they got a good view of
the main street it was almost an
organized battle now one solid mass of
men was being driven back but daly
could not tell whether they composed the
forces of conklin or derringer the
fighting was terrific and stunned men
were being trampled in the surge and flow
of the struggle
  thgy got in the back door and two or
three watchmen were satisfied to let them
make their way through the merchandise
after they had explained their errand
the front of the store was deserted
  i wonder whether ivers is out watch-
ing-no he wouldnt be texas said as
they mounted the stairs
iie upper foor was practically
dark somewhere in the rear one
light was burning
  his office is lighted daly re-
marked i-
  throw up your hands
  from behind four different masses of
material there came four men all had
guns and all were masked they ad-
vanced toward the flyers the leaders
eyes sparkling through the slits in the
mask where had daly seen those eyes
before
  here whats this
   ivers was at the door of his office
stay where you are barked some-
body and a man detached himself from
his comrades and covered the storekeeper
  every one of these fellows is a mexi-
can daly told himself unbelievingly
and ivers damn him is in on it try-
ing to pretend these men could be hiding
outside his office door without him
knowing it
  what saps we are tex was groaning
as the men got to them
  daly was flaying himself also they
should have buried the money back of the
gambling place no the hiding place
would have been tortured out of them if
necessary
  i presume this is what you want he
said coolly thrusting the bag forward
  the leader bowed mockingly he was
tall and slender why was he so familiar
  you are right he agreed we also
want lieutenant macdowell
 what
  it was an exclamation of utter aston-
ishment from the texan
  what the hell do you mean ivers
fairly shrieked in his wheezy voice
  we shall take lieutenant macdowell
across the river and it will cost his father
fifty thousand dollars to get him back
  the leader spoke those words as if
enjoying them behind the mask his
peculiar eyes were aglow with a curious
catlike light suddenly dalys mind like
ice now found the solution of the famil-
iarity he was the man from whom they
had asked directions that afternoon-
the blond hair and the oriental eyes it
could be no one else and he had known
ivers from what he had said
  the directions shall be given now
we will go into the office to avoid
observation
  the stilted english spoken with just
the trace of an accent was the final
identification of the mocking outlaw as
far as the duke was concerned helpless
before six ready guns ivers and the two
flyers were marched into the office
right outside the window were hundreds
of people daly reflected on the ground
floor were watchmen that battle out-
side was interspersed with shots now
  listen daly
  the leader was businesslike now his
masked cohorts disposed themselves in a
circle at least three of them were
mexican
  tomorrow or at latest the next day
you will fly with the money down the
river between laredo and mcmullen

thomson burtis
you will find on the mexican side of
the river a field with a white cross in
it you will land there if there are
other ships in the air all will be lost if
ou have guns on your ship all will be
lost you will land if all is correct a
man will meet you and you will be
directed where to fly to give over the
money and to return lieutenant mac-
dowell to his father if nothing happens
surely you would not expect us to let him
go free
  he waited a moment for reply he was
enjoying himself to the hilt the outwardly
composed but inwardly boiling daly
could see tex was a streak of flame
he was half crouched ready to spring on
all those guns at once
  now the leader went on with relish
we shall proceed bind mr ivers and
mr daly caballeros i know that mr
ivers and mr macdowell senior are
partners there will be no excuse for lack
of money
  for a second daly considered showing
his hand the next instant he discarded
the idea doubtless he and tex would
be deader than doornails the second he
denounced ivers as he stood quietly
allowing his hands to be bound behind
his back and his ankles to be strapped
he thought things through if ivers was
a secret ally of derringer he was doubt-
lessly in league with these bandits a
kidnaping of tex-he would be justified
from the worlds point of view in put-
ting up the money without even consult-
ing the elder macdowell the very next
day as a matter of fact
  our little trip down here was figured
to put about sixty thousand dollars of
texs fathers money into the pockets of
ivors and derringer daly reflected
  suddenly the fat flabby basilisk eyed
ivers became a monster to him never
had he felt so utterly repelled by a per-
sonality as he was by the man who had
suddenly become like an unclean animal
double crossing his dearest friend un-
hesitatingly committing him to mental
anguish and enriching himself like a
ghoul   
  buenas noches
  the bandit leader was standing in the
doorway looking down at the two bound
and gagged men daly was lying three or
four feet from ivers
  ill be all right duke tex said his
voice choked with fury
  the outlaw put out the light and daly
could hear the door lock click
without a seconds delay daly
writhed across the floor toward
ivers with his back to the
merchant he felt with his fettered hands
for the hands of his enemy the bonds
on ivers were very loose tex was in no
special danger he reflected however
something always to be figured was part
of the temperament of the texan he
would seize the slightest excuse for
making a break the getaway to the
border must be all arranged for of
course and men who would dare under
no matter what protection to kidnap an
army officer would certainly take no
chances nor would they hesitate to
shoot and shoot to kill if necessary
above all the situation at verona de-
manded cleaning up from ivers and
derringer and donnelly and those men
on whom there was no absolutely ironclad
evidence which would hold in court he
could expect no confession in that
bandit gang however there would be
men who would talk
  ivers hands were free his bonds had
been a joke he untied his ankles and
the duke heard him get to his feet the
next moment the light was on again and
the fat storekeeper was untying daly
  this is a hell of a note he was saying
his full moon face woebegone billll
never forgive me for this
  as daly got to his feet he was wonder-
ing for the dozenth time whether the
gamblers had gotten word to ivers that
the flyers had known that their signals
had been given away he decided that
the chances of that were slim they
could not be sure anyhow
  nothing could be gained and every-
thing lost possibly by giving away his
the duke and the ducats

hand right then ivers might realize
from the result of the game that his share
in the plot was known for a second
daly hesitated outside the noise had
died away somewhat the battle seemed
to have shifted down the street there
were shots from a distance now
  daly lifted the telephone first hed
get the laredo flight in action the
bandits were riding doubtless and they
had fifteen miles to go they could be
cut off at the river
 no use of that ivers wheezed
somebody-jed conklin i guess-cut
the lines between here and laredo
  the silent daly speedily verified that
information
 so long he said evenly im
going
 wait a minute ivers said in
alarm what are you going to-
  get after tex of course
  daly was standing at the door seem-
ingly utterly composed
  you cant do that theyd kill tex
perhaps what can you do to interfere
i can fly after em
 dalys shadowed eyes were on the
heavy jowled face and perhaps some-
thing in them gave his thoughts away
if final proof were needed of ivers par-
ticipation in the scheme he had it then
  i wont let you do it for the sake of
tex and bill ivers told him and a new
note had crept into his voice
  his hand apparently casually strayed
toward a desk drawer in a split second
dalys mind was made up time was
precious but ivers had an excuse to hold
him there he could pretend it was for
the best interests of macdowell
  dalys gun was out in a second
  the hell you will he said icily
ivers im going and going now ill
tie you up so you cant interfere on any
pretext whatever dont move
inwardly he was thinking
if my ship was already out of com-
mission hed let me go out there those
guards of his werent instructed to
monkey with it unless it was necessary
for a few seconds ivers sat there like a
huge buddha he seemed eyeless and
there was a sudden effect of utter coldness
in him it was as though the flesh were
petrified but the spirit within radiating
vitality
  before you make a move daly he
said slowly his lips barely moving im
telling you youd better not youve got
the drop on me but youd better not
  hes thoroughly scared at the idea of
me getting into the air daly thought
with controlled exultation
  why not he asked aloud
  ill go to any lengths for macdowelps
sake to keep you from interfering even
to the extent of telling you that if you do
this crazy thing therell be a certain
young man arrested immediately for the
murder of one jim fitzpatrick within a
few miles of this place several years ago
  something seemed to snap inside daly
he knew that what he had been dreading
subconsciously all along had happened
he could see the headlines now
government agent accused of murder
in border barroom
  as he stood there in the barren office
a with the noise of verona washing
up through the windows there
were a few seconds in which he saw the
structure he had built for himself crashing
around him the past would be spread
for the country to read professional
gambler murderer-now a government
agent disgraced he would drop out of
the niche he had worked so hard to carve
for himself that the murder had been
self-defense would make no difference
  he had nothing to fear from the law
except exposure he faced the fact that
he would be an outcast a branded crook
and the hateful terrible days when he
had been forced to live a life he loathed
with people whom he despised would
come back the height to which he had
lifted himself by his bootstraps through
ten years of effort would be lost in one
plunge
  as he raised his eyes to those lines of
light in ivers face there was something
in them which made ivers say hastily

thomson burtis
  and im not the only one that knows
it either it wont do you any good to
put me out of the way
  as so frequently happened when he
faced a crisis dalys mind seemed ab-
normally keen despite the fact that his
heart was lead within him his brain
seemed to work automatically with a
sort of frozen clarity he had decided that
a few minutes of time one way or the
other meant little he could catch the
bandits in mexico if necessary and let
international law have its way with him
after macdowell was safe
  listen ivers he said coolly his eyes
looking into tragic depths rather than at
the man before him you can do as you
please about raking up the past if you
know as much as you do you know that
jim fitzpatrick was a white eyed rat of a
killer who got by because his father at
that time was the smuggling king of the
border who pulled wires that even led to
washington at times and you know
that the drunken louse shot a poor old
coon who didnt get him a sandwich fast
enough and that i shot him when he
turned on me because i told him what he
was go ahead and talk damn you and
youll have plenty of chance to you
may let the country know what i was
when i was a kid but by god theyll
know you were a doublecrossing crook
yourself
  ivers did not even blink his eyes
tension was like a physical thickness in
the air
  what do you mean he asked
huskily
  that youre in with derringer that
youre doublecrossing mr macdowell
that you tipped off our signals in this
game tonight and got us here to lose
money and that this abduction of tex is
a frameup to get you and your pals
another fifty thousand god what a rat
you are i dont know what youve got
against the macdowells but youll have
a chance to tell
  youre crazy daly and it wont get
you anything assuming for the sake of
argument that you were right what
proof would you have and wouldnt
you be crazy to-
  to what
  ivers eyed the ready gun and played
with his watch chain he looked around
to make sure that they were alone
  maybe he said slowly we can
make a deal
  daly knew in an instant that he could
trade silence for silence his own past
would remain a secret if he remained
silent on the subject of henry ivers
then with the force of a stunning physi-
cal blow the implication in ivers words
made his eyes widen and his body feel
numb ivers must realize that tex
knew as much as daly himself
  ivers did not expect that tex would be
able to tell any tales whatever
   the paralyzed flyer fought for control
now that he thought of it it seemed
probable already the gang had proved
themselves totally without scruples of
any kind the kidnaping of an army
officer was a serious business which would
result for the definitely known bandits in
an unending hunt it would be a matter
of international law they had been
masked tex would know what they
looked like what amount of money
would cause them to take a chance on such
a crime if they were not almost guaran-
teed safety after it was over what more
likely than that they collect the money
and kill macdowell anyway tex had
been a border patrolman for five years
and dozens of outlaws feared dreaded
and hated him he alone almost single
handed had put dave fitzpatrick be-
hind the bars and dave had had a legion
of followers ivers himself must hate the
elder macdowell vengeance and money
combined-why those very bandits in
whose charge he was might be made up of
men with a grudge against the officer of
the law
  in an instant daly made up his mind
everything in the world was forgotten
now except that the life of his friend was
in danger from that second on no
thought of his own personal safety entered
into his calculations in the slightest
the duke and the ducats

  just what do you mean he asked
quietly
  just that you do nothing nothing at
all and say nothing now or later i
agree to do likewise were alone we
can talk freely
  suppose i should tell you that tex
knows as much as i do
  ivers face did not change
  macdowell will not bother us
 it was said as coolly as if he were speak-
ing of a business deal daly lounged
against the desk
  i cant afford to have my life ruined
by this business he said calmly pretty
slick layout worth a couple of hundred
thousand dollars to you and derringer
eh say you must hate old man mac-
dowell
  ivers eyes were on his desk
  fifteen years ago he almost whis-
pered i swore id get him some day
what was the matter and why doesnt
he know it i should think-
  it seemed that ivers took warning
his eye lids raised suddenly
  none of your business and re-
member this you can be shot and shot
quickly as the identified murderer who
tried to escape every excuse will be
ours youre having a favor done you
when we offer to let you go
  daly moved like a striking rattlesnake
his gun came down on the head of that
mound of unclean flesh and ivers
slumped unconscious the duke had
learned all he could and he had no
doubt that neither he nor tex would live
to tell the tale if ivers had his way he
had swapped his own knowledge to get at
ivers plans and it behooved him to get
out of verona without delay his plans
were complete
in a trice he had bound the uncon-
scious man securely he must take a
chance on getting a start of a few
minutes he was not thinking of his per-
sonal safety he was thinking of mac
dowell
  he could climb the partition between
the office and the storeroom outside the
bandit had already locked the door as a
gesture to protect ivers possibly no one
would enter during the night derringer
and his men were busy
  he turned out the light after taking a
gun out of the desk drawer and scaled
the partition with the aid of a chair he
walked out boldly using the back way
he found a horse tethered to the rear of
the building that was lucky saved him
from borrowing or stealing one on the
main street a horse would make better
time than a car
  circling the town only lost him a little
time he did not even see the main street
but he got the impression that a veritable
mob of milling men were in excited con-
clave along its entire length riding like
the wind he sped through the mesquite
toward the field he covered the two
miles in a few minutes and by that time
his plan of action was settled in his mind
  he rode toward the field behind the
barrier of the canvas hangar and left his
horse there undoubtedly those guards
had been carefully instructed ivers
must have figured on the possibility of
the ships being used should daly by any
chance get free they would have orders
to keep him out of the air by some method
or other
  he ran through the mesquite toward
the hangar the noise of drills working
within a quarter of a mile of the field
drowned out any sound he might make
he got to the back of the canvas hangar
which seemed to have one light in it as
he crept around to the corner the
de haviland came into view
  four men were sitting around it plainly
visible in the moonlight
  a couple of em must be flyers daly
thought
  they were not more than fifty feet from
the front of the hangar if that
  thank god i brought the other gun
he thought as he got it out
  both guns cocked and ready he broke
into a run
  put up your hands he shouted
dont make another move
  the surprise was complete he looked

thomson burtis
down into the amazed faces of the two
guards and of the men who must be
from their clothing the flyers one to
his surprise was a young mexican with a
pock marked face the other was the
most furtive eyed man he had ever seen
middle aged and very small he seemed to
be totally unable to look at daly in any
other manner than quick frightened
glances probably he was the mechanic
  as daly was about to speak he sud-
denly stiffened from afar his ears caught
the sound of thudding hoofbeats two
horses some one was riding and riding
fast toward the field had ivers been
discovered by his friends
  you may be on the level all of you
he said tersely but i take no chances
drop your guns you guards and then the
four of you run like hell for the other end
of this field fast
  for a second they hesitated he shot
slightly to one side of the mechanic
  i meant it he said coolly and you
flyers-dont get into the air or ill shoot
you down without asking any ques-
tions
  the mexican pilot dropped a blistering
curse and started to run he was un-
armed the others their eyes darting
toward the horsemen who were now in
sight five hundred yards away did like-
wise
  the ship was all right daly thought
as he vaulted into the rear cockpit the
libertyluckily had a self-starter and he
leaned over the partitions between the
cockpits to start it on the second try it
caught there were shots from the
horsemen-his last doubt as to their
mission was swept away
without fastening his belt he
gave the cold liberty the gun
he wiggled the controls very
slightly as the big bomber rushed across
the field elevators and ailerons moved
obediently
  close to the black wall of mesquite on
the other end of the field he pulled back
on the stick and the dh answered
it took the smooth night air cleanly de-
spite the sputtering motor he circled the
field as he unwound the radio antenna
that radio key wgis his reason for being
in the back seat the roar of the motor
grew smoother as the liberty warmed
it had been a desperate chance taking off
with it stone cold but he had won
  he glanced down at the field the
four men were back in front of the
hangar talking to the two horsemen
what could be more probable than that
that ship said by conklin to be sub-
sidized by derringer should be used for
illegal purposes at times there might
even be machine guns available to mount
on the rear seat it had a scarf mount he
remembered
 as he methodically unwound the
antenna his whole being was concentrated
on but one thing the saving of tex
nevertheless there seemed to be a part
of his brain which automatically worked
along steadily putting the various ele-
ments in the situation in their proper
places the abduction of macdowell had
been a stroke of genuis-an excellent ex-
cuse for ivers to put  of the elder
macdowells money in his pocket without
so much as consulting with the old man
probably ivers had not figured on killing
tex until he had found out how much the
two flyers knew during the entire time
the merchant had banked more or less on
the full cooperation of daly in an emer-
gency through the power of blackmail
the motive behind his machinations had
been partly revenge for something which
had happened in the past and partly the
opportunity to make a great deal of
money between embezzling funds from
the business dealing in acreage poker
and the kidnaping thrusting the blame
for all losses on conditions at verona a
quarter of a million dollars seemed a
small estimate of the sure money ivers
could make in his position of trust
  the antenna was out now and the
metal fish at the end of it gleamed in
the moonlight as dalys hand found the
key he pointed the de haviland for the
river his hand rested motionless on the
sending instrument for a moment how-
the duke and the ducats

ever as his eyes swept the shadowed
earth for verona a white city under
the moon seemed to be burning up
there were three fires on the main street
and in the light of the flames the swarming
mobs were like frightened ants scurrying
around a ruined ant hill
  in wrecking the joints they started
some fires daly thought
  the field itself was a sight to strike the
observer with awe derrick lights winked
and boiler mouths shone red and on the
derrick floors men were toiling vehicles
crawled over the roads with gleaming eyes
as the work of the field went on
 it was all part of the nightmare to
daly his only hope was a negative one
-to save macdowell for himself there
was none once again his life built on a
rotten foundation was about to crumble
that mask of a face was drawn as he
bent over his key and his eyes were like
windows showing the suffering within
  he concentrated fiercely on his work
he could not hear his own signals of
course above the bellow of the liberty
as he sent out the laredo call a dozen
times then he went to work sending
his message slowly as the dh roared
along a thousand feet high toward the
river
    daly in air above verona macdowell
  kidnaped by bandits one hour ago must be
  near river send two ships down river to help
  me send others to verona situation very
  bad get henry ivers derringer and conklin
  notify rangers sheriff and so forth
  he could waste no more time on send-
ing they would have the message the
radio shack was open night and day
he looked down he was over mexico
the rio grande a mile north of him
 as he banked around he made quick
calculations while his eyes swept the sky
for signs of an airplane that civilian
plane might not heed his warning if it
had guns it might be sent out to get him
that would leave matters in excellent
shape for ivers and derringer-and a
burned ship and a few bones tell no tales
of murder
  the bandits probably had not ridden
very fast fifteen miles and only an
hour had passed they should be near
the river
  they were at least there was a group
of horsemen riding like mad two miles
east of the little settlements on the river
bank
  they arent feeling as good as their
captive right now daly thought grimly
now what shall i do with tex in the
middle of em i cant shoot so well
he was circling over them they
were a mile from the river riding
through the mesquite there was
a strip of clearings a half mile wide along
the northern bank of the rio grande
theyd have to come out in the open
soon
  he turned south a mile back of them
and fifteen hundred feet high he took a
quick look at his instruments all was
well on those gages from oil pressure to
battery charging rate the twelve
cylinder liberty was bellowing along
evenly and he tried the switches absently
as he strove to form a plan he could
just follow them spotting their location
but a couple of sparkplugs fouled with
oil would mean the ruin of all his plans
he dared not trust macdowells life to
that motor
  a man of one idea he was so utterly
engrossed in his thoughts that when the
windshield shattered before his eyes he
looked at it for the moment in dull
wonder
  then his head snapped around and he
sent the de haviland into a dizzy vertical
bank which seemed to almost break it in
two behind him four hundred feet
higher than he was the civilian ship in
the back seat a man was standing hand-
ling a machine gun which was mounted
there that ship had taken off sneaked
north probably to gain altitude got
higher than he was and swooped down
out of the night sky
  and he was still in the back seat his
gun control was in the front cockpit
he cursed with cold venom as he twisted

thomson burtis
his ship once more only blind luck had
saved him from being shot down his
wings had holes in them
  he saw his chance the other ship was
banking to give the back seat man a
chance to shoot in an instant the
dukes belt was off and he had plunged
head first into the front cockpit as the
dh faltered in a stall he grabbed the
stick he got to the seat and as he
strapped the belt he sent the bomber
curving madly through the air
  he had one advantage-front guns to
aim with the ship they had altitude
but they had to present a broadside view
to give the machine vgunner a chance
he was a big man
  by god i believe its henry ivers
the duke told himself slowly going
to get to mexico if he doesnt shoot me
down eh
  the two ships circled their motors
fairly shaking the earth as they roared
along at full speed the duke was very
quiet and very calm now he watched
like a hawk he must spoil their shots
waiting his chance
  spots of fire came from the gun above
he went into a dive twisting as he dived
at right angles to their course the
cruiser banked to keep him in range
they figured on getting him as he passed
underneath them
  in a split second he changed his dive
banking steeply to the left their course
was to the right the dh was quiver-
ing with the terrific speed of that full
power dive and the libertys roar rose
to a mad bellow as the tachometer showed
eighteen hundred and fifty revolutions a
minute and the airspeed hovered around
two hundred and fifteen
  he glanced around they were bank-
ing to the left in a moment the guns
would be on him but for a small interval
of time the ships would be too far apart
for accurate shooting
  there he shot the dice with destruction
without hesitation he lifted the frail
de haviland upward in a clean arc up
and up it went with that excess speed
every second he expected to feel a bullet
  it started over on its back five hundred
feet higher than it had been before with
rudder and stick plus the feel of the ship
which had made him a great pilot he
turned the dhon its horizontal axis in
a half roll
  hanging upsidedown then sideward
as the ship answered there came a second
when there loomed before his sights the
bulk of the other ship it had twisted
again reversing its course as his dh
turned his hand was pressed down on the
gun control and his front guns were
spraying lead
  how he did it he did not know but
even as the dh was turning he kept its
nose pointed at the other ship then the
cruiser passed out of range
  right side up stalled he looked about
for it he was as high as they were now
he was higher
  they were below him and seemed in
trouble the cruiser turned loggily
  to hell with you he said to himself
with icy calmness and dived on them
  he saw his tracers travel almost the
length of the ship and then he scarcely
watched it as it spun earthward he was
already on his way toward those gallop-
ing horsemen who were just entering the
open when the cruiser hurtled to the
ground and a great ball of fire lit up the
earth for miles around
  would the bandits give up now he
wondered probably not they could
not know that ivers himself had been in
that ship largely for the purpose of
making a clean getaway they had
figured on getting daly with those first
shots
  and they nearly did he thought
  suddenly he felt hope bounding in his
heart he was a half mile to one side
of the bunched riders he sent the dh
downward ina fast dive pointed at them
the motor sputtered had some bullet
taken effect in it god he must hurry
that roar didnt sound right sort of
uneven
  now he was close to them flying at two
miles and a half a minute only five feet
off the ground
the duke and the ducats

  what he had thought might happen
did those frightened horses were now a
group of crazed bucking broncos out of
control as the ship flashed toward them
one rider was on the ground the rest
of them to a man were fighting their
horses	
  and as daly zoomed up over them he
saw tex macdowell with the skill born
of his ranch boyhood guide his maddened
pony northward like a frightened rabbit
  he had a hundred yard start-no more
than that suddenly daly was aware of
the fact that the dh was stalling he
pushed forward on the stick as the motor
sputtered and died it always died
momentarily in an extreme stall
  but as he got the ship into a dive to
regain flying speed it did not catch again
the next second blue flame was playing
over the motor the gas line had broken
flooding the hot liberty a bullet had
weakened it doubtlessly but he was
afire six hundred feet in the air
  somehow it seemed unimportant he
got the ship into a sideslip as a wave of
heat blistered him his right wing which
was pointed upward in the slip was al-
ready being eaten by flames for the
moment he was not too uncomfortable as
the flames blew upward and away from
him his eyes were on the ground he
had to hold his goggles to keep the ter-
rific airstream coming upward at him as
a result of the slip from tearing them off
there was tex going like mad for
the mesquite one lone rider was
after him and gaining the others
were huddled near the river apparently
unwilling to separate themselves from
their nearness to mexico and safety
  if there was left in duke daly any
trace of selfishness or fear or dross of any
kind it was burned away during that
moment when he hung beneath a tran-
quil night sky in his flaming de haviland
the second he pointed its nose down the
draft would blow the fire back on him and
the fuselage would turn into a flaming
coffin by sideslipping to the ground he
had a chance for life down below the
man whose place could never be taken in
the life of duke daly was fleeing for his
life and losing
  the dh was three hundred feet high
losing altitude steadily there was a
curious look in dalys eyes as he took a
deep breath of the last pure air he would
ever breathe pain was gone from them
and shadows had lifted and it was as if
he were seeing visions as he brought the
ships nose down and started the last
dive
  in a split second his eyes were burning
and his clothes charring heat rolled
over him in a sickening wave his bleary
eyes never wavered however and pain
was non-existent he did not breathe
he would not fill his lungs with smoke
and fire yet
  he had his bead dazed his head
reeling he sent a hail of death down on
the pursuing bandit and not until the
bandit had toppled from his horse did
dalys hand leave the gun control
  fifty feet from the ground now his
body was a torturing shell he was
groaning as he lifted the ship in a side-
slip he gulped in air as he rammed the
bomber downward with top rudder he
unloosened his belt perhaps he would
be thrown clear of the fire-
  there was a crash and he felt himself
hurtling through the air the next second
his brain became a ball of fire which was
extinguished in an instant and there was
no more pain
he did not know it but tex had
doubled back as his pursuer had
fallen from his horse and his hands
had beat out the slowly burning spots in
dalys clothing ten minutes later a
laredo ship had arrived and carried him
back to the hospital it was there he
found himself next morning thoroughly
bandaged and listless from the effects of
opiates
  scarcely had he opened his eyes when
the nurse came in followed by mac-
dowell the big texan was unshaven
eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep and as
dirty as a roustabout but the old grin

thomson burtis
was there and there was a sparkle in his
eyes which took no heed of fatigue
  you probably dont feel so good but
i feel fine he drawled they say youre
all right-burns not so damn serious
and lungs ok
  daly smiled briefly
  how is everything in the oil village
he asked weakly
  not so bad did you know that the
ship you shot down had hank ivers in
it
  uh-huh i thought so
  tell me what happened up there first
after i left tex commanded
  he was sitting on the edge of the bed
and his glowing eyes were hard for daly
to meet daly told the story briefly and
haltingly and macdowells eyes grew
brighter all the time
  well he said slowly i guess as a
matter of fact that there were only a
couple of people who knew about that
fitzpatrick incident one was ivers and
the other this head bandit that had me in
charge he was enjoying himself so
much i was scared of what would happen
the rest of em were just supers dumb
spigs in for a little money from the
way he talked tjiis blond boy-you re-
member we saw him on the street-was a
follower of dave fitzpatricks and to get
me whod got dave put in jail was a
great pleasure between him and ivers
from what you said id have had a nice
time
  laredo got my message all right did
they
  sure and found the town in a hell of
a mess the sheriffs there now with a
big posse i guess he isnt happy they
like to let these oil towns alone-but it
had to be done the boys here say you
told em to get conklin and derringer
and hold em well they found slats
badly wounded some guy hed rooked
took a pot shot at him in the fights i
guess
  is he alive
  yeah but nobody knows whether
hell live or not tex said without sor-
row i tipped off the sheriff and sick or
no sick they gave him the third degree
didnt need much he figures hes a
goner and came pretty clean admits
everything including airplane smuggling
on the side except that he was not in on
the kidnaping at all and had nothing to
do with it it was ivers cute little idea
to have dad pay him fifty thousand
which he hadnt spent see
  hows that little banty rooster conk-
lin inquired daly and for a second a
real grin was on his pallid drawn face
tex laughed long and loud
  he admitted what he was up to and
the little squirt was pretty near right
hed been about ruined by derringers
crooked work and he aimed to get a
chance to live by fair means or foul he
didnt want us messing in just at the
moment when he started to take der-
ringer for a ride they let him go i
guess-nothing on him that isnt taken
for granted in a town like that
  daly felt better somehow it always
gave him a feeling of contentment to have
tex around it was great to have an
anchor of some sort somebody to tie to
he was busy figuring things out more in
detail
  assuming that this bandit i killed-
he had the poker money which i
got tex interrupted with a grin
  good anyway assuming that he was
tickled to be in on the deal just to get
back at a patrolman whod put his boss
in jail how do you explain ivers he
was sure poison
  tex nodded
  dads coming down in a week he
stated wired me in answer to mine
that it must have its root in some business
deal where dad got the best of him
probably partly just the money angle
too dad said he was always a penny
pincher and through that lost out on a
lot of stuff around texas in the past
you never can tell about these fifteen
year grudges they get big when you
think of em all that time dad fights
hard but he fights clean i know that
also nodded the duke all this
murder and stuff he was driven to when
the duke and the ducats

a guy starts to steal and the guns around
murder isnt far away and the deeper he
gets the longer lengths hell go to to get
out
  right you are drawled macdowell
as he got to his feet its my hunch hed
have shrunk from killing in real horror at
the start but this bandit guy-he was
looking at me and licking his chops
those breeds-and he is one-are tough
to figure resent the inferior blood in
em and are run by it
  he gave daly a cigaret lighted one for
himself and strolled to the door
  ill get out before they kick me out
he announced see you this afternoon
everythings jake and dont worry about
the papers if you get what i mean ivers
and the bandit are both out of the way
and your memoirs wont be published
daly smiled and took a deep breath
the blow which would have knocked him
out of sight of the world he loved would
not fall-not yet anyhow some day it
would probably
  and say duke macdowell said
casually thanks for the help last
night
  his eyes were on his cigaret dalys
were on his examining the ash critically
  sure everything came out great
he said evenly even to the acreage if
derringer confessed
  right you are tex said a trifle
huskily mission successfully com-
pleted doggone your crazy hide
w c tuttle
tells of a whittling sheriff and
the feud of mojave wells

hie                
by order of buck brady
buck brady was always whit-
tling thin shavings were an
i obsession with buck he would
sit for hours tilted back in a
broken chair against the shady side of his
little office knees almost touching his
chin his long thin face serious over the
task of reducing a piece of soft pine to
thin shavings
  buck was the sheriff of mojave wells
and mojave wells was a heat and sand
scoured false fronted town in road run-
ner valley the town was invisible from
a distance because even the painted signs
on the business houses had been sand
blasted until they were unreadable
  it was the end of the roundup in road
runner valley and buck knew that be-
fore night the town would be filled with
thirsty cowboys whose overall pockets
were lined with money and that when
whisky met cowboy there might be plenty
of work for the sheriff
 the first to arrive was ben dolan a
 thin faced gaunt sort of cowboy astride
 a weary looking roan instead of heading
 for a saloon ben dismounted in front of
 the sheriffs office dropped his reins in
 the dirt and sat down beside the sheriff
 hyah buck

 at his handiwork whatcha know

  youre welcome
  ben took his horse and headed for a
saloon while more cowboys came racing
in their horses covered with lather and
dust the sheriff watched the first con-
tingent arrive it was bud hickman and
his gang from the tumbling k bud was
a likable looking cowboy about twenty-
five years of age tall lithe swarthy as an
indian with curling black hair and a
white toothed smile his crew was a
wild riding lot of hard bitted punchers
ready for fun or fight at a moments
notice
  they noted that pete asher and the
j boys had not arrived yet so they all
headed for the desert well saloon the
biggest place of its kind in mojave wells
the sheriff stood on the edge of the side-
walk for a while cogitating deeply he
had been sheriff of that particular county
for nearly two terms which meant that
buck brady was pretty much of a man
finally he went into his little office and
after a search he found an old paint brush
t
w c tuttle
and a few ounces of almost dried paint
in a battered can he kicked the ends
out of a soap box drew out the nails and
sat down at his desk
  pete asher and his crew rode in from
the j tied their horses farther up the
street and entered the prospect saloon
asher was a heavily built hard faced
cowboy about the same age as bud hick-
man his hair was almost a neutral
shade his eyes deep set and blue there
was little to choose between his gang and
the one which came in with bud hick-
man and in numbers they were about
equal
  there were more outfits to come but
they were not connected with the feud
bud and his men were at the bar when
 he sheriff came in and they greeted him
noisily he was carrying a box end and
 hammer and without any leave from
the proprietor he proceeded to nail his
sign to one of the walls it read
      from now on every man
      must turn his gun over
      to my office until he is
      ready to leave town
           by order of
           -buck brady
some of the men laughed some
swore bud hickman strode over
to the sheriff and glared at him
belligerently
  you tryin to kid somebody buck
he asked
  the sheriff looked steadily at bud for
several moments
   i aint in the habit of ldddin anybodv
am i
  bud flushed quickly but he recognized
the fact that buck brady would back up
his sign that was why buck was their
sheriff
  kinda sudden ainteha asked bud
  no-o-o ive been thinkin this out
quite a while bud
  is this the idea queried bud we
all turn our guns over to you and you
turn em back when were ready to leave
town 
  thats what the sign says bud and
i wrote the sign
  bud laughed and turned to his men
its all right boys shuck your guns
i reckon we can stand it if the others
can and then to the sheriff you
might have a little trouble with pete and
his gang
  i hope theyll be reasonable
  the men put their guns on a poker
table and the sheriff picked them up
putting some in his pockets some inside
the waistband of his overalls
  youll have to remember your own
guns boys he said
  i reckon i can spot mine said bud
i made them handles
the sheriff thanked them kindly
and went back to his office where he
locked the guns in his desk then
he went over to the prospect saloon where
he nailed up his other notice asher and
his men didnt take so kindly to the idea
some of them were openly belligerent
and it seemed for a few moments that the
sheriff had a tough job but asher took
the matter out of their hands
  i suppose this thing only applies to
me and my men eh
  youre supposin wrong pete ive
already collected from the tumblin k
youve collected from bud hick-
man
  why not
  oh i jist wondered but suppose we
dont give you our guns
  the sheriff considered pete calmly
then
  ive alius liked you asher youve
been a damn fool in lotsa ways but
youre jist human like the rest of us
ive posted my notice and i wrote it
myself
  but jist suppose we refuse to give up
our guns
  that said the sheriff calmly would
be jist too damn bad
  oh- softly-and if i should hap-
pen to want to leave town youd give
me back my gun
   jist like the sign says pete
by order of buck brady

  all right heres mine take em off
boys we dont need em-now
  the sheriff looked over the guns as he
deposited them about his person he
walked out swinging the hammer in his
hand
  dont that beat hell laughed pete
  ill betcha somebody told him some-
thin said a cowboy
  i dont like the idea of a moth eaten
old sidewinder takin my gun away
complained a cowboy who was new to
the country wed a had some fun if
wed refused
  youve got a sweet idea of fun
growled pete that moth eaten old
sidewinder is jist thirty-two years old
and if we hadnt turned them guns over
to him hed jist about ruined the whole
gang of us with his pet winchester when
you see by order of buck brady you
better read the upper part of it and act
accordingly
 all the cowboys went back to
- their drinking and the sheriff was
forgotten but both bud and pete
kept track of the sun the sheriff humped
in his chair still whittling saw pete come
out saunter to the hitching rack where
he could view the sun it was still an
hour high
  ben dolan fairly well filled with liquor
came over again and squatted on his heels
beside the sheriff ben was as hard bitted
as the rest of the cowboys but he liked
both bud and pete so well that he hated
to see either of them wounded or killed
and ben was wise enough to understand
that both men would claim their guns at
sundown
  they saw bud leave the desert well
saloon walk halfway across the street
as if heading for a store stop and look
toward the west he too was keeping
cases on the sun then he turned and
went back to the saloon ben made
meaningless marks in the sand with a
forefinger while the sheriff whittled
thoughtfully
  you shore collected a lot of guns
sheriff
  yea-a-ah
  almost sundown
  the sheriff shut one eye and considered
ben then he looked toward both
saloons and went on whittling
  the boys are gettin nervous  said ben
  i notice
  several cowboys were standing in front
of the prospect saloon now and one of
them essayed a clog dance his boots
sounded loud on the old wooden side-
walk another beat time on a porch post
with the end of a quirt it was like the
beating of a tomtom and he kept it up for
a time after the dancer had stopped the
beater was swarthy with high cheekbones
  some of buds gang came from the
desert well and stood around in front
of the building one of them a little
drunker than the rest started across the
street toward the sheriffs office but the
others stopped him and after an argu-
ment persuaded him to desist
  its kinda sultry said ben rubbing
his forehead
  the sheriff nodded and looked at the
sun only half of which was visible now
he blinked from the strong light and cut
several shavings which did not suit him
at all a couple of dogs met in the middle
of the street town dogs fat and with a
friendship of long standing but now
they growled ominously at each other as
they circled looking for an opening
  sic em hissed a cowboy from in
front of the desert well
  take him tige shake his fleas
loose four bits on the yaller one
  youve done made a bet cowboy
choose him ponto
  but the dogs only circled and growled
and finally separated
  mebbe theyre waitin for the sun to
go down whispered ben
  the sheriff shook his head
  got more sense than men have
the sun was down only the tip
was visible and the crests of the
broken hills showed a golden high-
light it was very still in mojave wells
the shadows were gone now and the street

w c tuttle
glowed with a yellow light which would
not last long twilight was unknown in
mojave wells sundown a streak of
gold would quickly fade to blue and
then darkness
  bud hickman came from the desert
well and went straight to the hitch rack
where he untied his horse and swung into
the saddle simultaneously with buds
move pete asher came riding from the
rack beside the prospect it was not a
casual move they intended to deceive
nobody not even the sheriff of mojave
wells the cowboys of both outfits were
in the street watching intently
  bud came straight to the sheriff and
fifty feet behind him was pete buds
face was grim his mouth set in a thin
line
  im pullin out buck he said softly
would you mind handin me my gun
  the sheriff stopped whittling tilted
forward in his chair and got slowly to his
feet he looked closely at bud but said
nothing as he turned and went into the
office pete moved in closer but he and
bud ignored each other ben sighed and
leaned against the wall
  the sheriff came out carrying a gun
in each hand for several moments he
looked at the two men rather sorrowfully
  i reckon youre pullin out too
aintcha pete
  pete nodded quickly and held out his
hand for the gun they had been friends
these two until a woman had come be-
tween them bud holstered his gun
swung his horse around and rode slowly
down the street looking straight ahead
pete accepted his gun glanced at it to
see that it was fully loaded snapped it
down in his holster and swung his horse
around riding back to the center of the
street
  ben swore softly under his breath
both of these men were good revolver
shots
  goin to be a funeral around here
-mebbe two he muttered why
dontcha stop it buck gawd amighty
this aint right look at bud-hes
turnin
  you didnt expect hed run away
didja
  the contestants in this desert town
drama were two hundred feet apart
facing each other both horses moving
slowly they had both played a square
game there was no advantage now
two hundred feet is a long shot both
men had drawn their guns buds horse
was dancing a little and he spurred it
viciously
  pete waited
  bens hands were gripping the wall
beside him he had seen gun fights
before but they had all been unpre-
meditated affairs this one was too
much like an execution the groups of
cowboys were as immobile as dummy
figures even the horses at the hitch
racks had ceased moving
  bud and pete were closing the gap
between them closing it slowly each
waiting for the other to make the first
move with a gun they were only a
hundred feet apart now it was close
enough but neither of them made a
move to lift his gun
  ninety feet thirty yards either of
them could hit a tomato can at that dis-
tance eighty feet horses walking
slowly seventy feet sixty feet twenty
yards now they were almost in front
of the sheriffs office ben laughed fool-
ishly it would be a double funeral he
had seen bud shoot the head from a
prairie dog at that distance
  its a nice evenin for it said the
sheriff rather inanely
  and then it happened
both guns came up at exactly the
same instant bens eyes snapped
shut and he turned his head aside
  came a tiny ping hardly louder than
the mere snapping of a revolver hammer
another and another buds eyes jerked
open the two riders were thirty feet
apart leaning forward in their saddles
not a shot had been fired
  with a swift movement bud hickman
swung out the cylinder of his colt and
emptied the cartridges in his hand every
by order of buck brady

 primer had been dented there were
 marks on the bullets marks made by the
 jaws of a pair of pliers
    pete was swearing viciously as he
 drew cartridges from his belt and started
 to stuff them in his gun
    but the sheriff halted him with a sharp
  word
    damn you you pulled the powder on
 my shells snarled pete
    yeah and ill pull somethin else out
  of you if you make one more move
  said the sheriff calmly cmere bud
    bud rode up to him still holding the
  empty gun in his hand pete had quit
  trying to load his gun they looked
  coldly at each other
   you boys hadnt ort to fight said
  the sheriff calmly both of you goin
  off kinda half cocked as you might say
    the men from both outfits had moved
 in close now trying to understand what
 it was all about their enmity all but for-
 gotten in this queer turn of events
    i pulled them bullets admitted the
  sheriff i dont reckon either of you
  showed any yaller streak you played
  v the game square and i like you both for
  it personally i kinda enjoyed it it
  was like lookin at a sliow i was the
  only one that knowed how it would turn
  out
  was it any of your damn business
how it turned out demanded pete
hotly
  in a way it was pete- calmly
barrin my friendship with both of you
and my position as sheriff it still was my
business in a way now you two boys
was aimin to kill each other over a
woman yeah ben told me about it
you might thank ben instead of glarin
at him
  he liked both of you and he didnt
want no killin done so he told me about
it i dont think for a minute that this
smith girl would care to have you killin
each other over her most girls dont
anyway it was a sucker idea because
there aint no smith girl around here any
more so you was tryin to kill each other
for nothin
  what do you mean blurted bud
  the smiths aint moved away of-
fered a cowboy
  if you hadnt had so much killin on
your mind you might have found out
that me and the smith girl was married
over a week ago you boys better go
back and have your spree as soon as
you give me back them guns cause ive
got work to do
  whittlin asked bud blankly
  lookin for somethin to whittle on
a story of the teak forests of siam
        by clark brockman
william sommerfield
the british teak loalla in
charge of the work in the me
mai concession of the further
india corporation in north siam satin the
campchair in frontof his tent before him
stretched the dark walled avenue cut
through the jungle a few months before by
a wild tropical storm across its farther
end flowed the me mai still muddy from
t he recent rains on a high limb of a dead
cottonwood tree rising from the opposite
bank two grotesque hornbills carried on
their amours
  sommerfield stretched his long angular
arms luxuriously and inhaled the opiate
fragrance of the slender white blossoms of
the dawlc cham pee he gazed at the patch
of brown water down -the avenue a great
teak log floated lazily on its muddy surface
a faint smile twitched the corners of his
firm mouth he ran his long fingers
through his thin sandy hair that log
was a straggler
  during the preceding forty-eight hours
there had been a rain the like of which had
not been heard of in years and more than
twenty thousand logs that had been lying
in the dry bed of the stream for eight years
had been floated out to the river and started

elephant
g-he
  white
the white elephant

on the way to bangkok in those few hours
he had justified his recent transfer to the
me mai he had succeeded where others
had failed it had meant almost thirty
hours of constant toil but it had been
accomplished and fourteen hours of sound
sleep had put him in the best of spirits
 it was ten oclock in the morning and
the boy was just removing the breakfast
dishes sommerfield had decided to take
a day off he would inspect no logs he
would break his way through no jungle
he would rest read his mail and get what
pleasure there was in life for a jungle
walla exiled from civilization
 when the breakfast dishes had been
removed the boy brought out the stack of
mail that a carrier had brought from
chiengmai the day before sommerfield
had been too tired to read them then but
gazed at them hungrily as the boy placed
them on the table he crossed the tanned
knees between his shorts and golf hose
and settled himself for a comfortable
morning
  his feeling of satisfaction and content-
ment was dispelled by the first letter he
read it was a letter from hodgkins in
bangkok at varying intervals hodgkins
sent to all members of the company a copy
of his further india teak tirade a breezy
letter giving the news and gossip of inter-
est to every member of the company the
letter which sommerfield opened was
written in a more serious vein than was
habitual with hodgkins the first para-
graph was as follows
teak wallas to be discharged
    yesterday it became known that the rumors
  which have been afloat for the past two months
  are confirmed the lease on the prae jungle
  which was denied the further india corpora-
  tion on the ground that the government would
  itself extract the teak has been granted to the
  compagnie general dextreme oriente as
  this is the last uncut jungle in the country the
  work of the corporation will probably end with
  the work now under way unless the company
  is able to do something immediately to ingrati-
  ate itself with the government there will be no
  chance of finding further work for the assist-
  ants as only two men can be used in burma
  the jungle wallas may expect to have home leave
  and discharges within the next two years
  sommerfield reread the paragraph he
knew that it was not official but he also
knew that it contained more truth than
poetry he cursed the day he had signed
up with the company and cursed himself
for not resigning years before when he
would have been able to get into some
other kind of work for twelve years he
had given the company his all and now he
was to be turned out with no hope for the
future
e cursed the government
  a bunch of fools clutching for
a straw like a drowning man he
muttered currying favor with france
with the hope that if the crash comes
french troops will keep the king on his
throne and why the crash the igno-
rance of blind fools the tradition that
if buddha approves of a new king a white
elephant will be born in the kingdom
cant the new king reign without a white
elephant but no he calls in all the
mossbacks as advisors they get excited
because there is no white elephant their
fright spreads to the people and the rulers
fear insurrections conjured up by their
own imaginations damn them
  he pictured himself in england looking
for a position he knew he was not fitted
for work at home even if he could find it
his years in the jungle had made him
jungle shy he was afraid of people he
spent the christmas holidays on hunting
trips with some other jungle loallas be-
cause he was afraid of the crowds that
gathered at chiengmai and lampang
during the holidays he knew he would
be terrified if he had to accept a position
in a place where there would be a lot of
people around him
  his last home leave had been pleasant
in a way and yet the only times he felt at
ease were those when he was in a big arm-
chair in a corner of the club talking to
another jungle man who was also on
leave
  boy shouted sommerfield
  the boy appeared from behind the tent
  whisky soda
  the boy disappeared and in a moment

clark brockman
was back with the bottles and a glass
sommerfield poured himself a stiff drink
and gulped it down
  the boys eyes opened in amazement
the nai drinks yes but he does not
go at it with both feet in the trough as the
americans do he said to himself be-
hind the tent he gave vent to his surprise
bad news from muang nawk-the
foreign country- he announced and
discussed the possible nature of the news
with the cook and coolies
  when sommerfield had finished his let-
ters he ripped the wrappers from the six
copies of the bangkok times arranged
them in chronological order and started to
read the lurid details of the strike in
england and the general unemployment
situation offered a strange fascination
he wasreading a description of how col-
lege students were running the busses in
london when one of the men from the
elephant camp rushed into the clearing
  sir father eclipse of the moon is on
must maa he is as terrible as a cholera
breeding spirit he has been tied but he
is breaking loose and we can do nothing
sommerfields first impulse was to say
that he did not care what happened but
he smothered the idea he was still
in charge of the work on the me mai
father eclipse of the moon was the great
tusker who had succeeded in breaking the
stacks of logs that had formed in the
stream during the high water and had
made it possible to float the logs down the
river they had expected the tusker to go
on must black oil had been oozing from
his must holes for several days but during
the rise in the stream red moon his
rider had been able to control him
where is he demanded sommerfield
tied to a tree in the elephant camp
replied the native but he is breaking
loose and we can not get near him
has nai kow called in the other ele-
phants
  no sir we are all trying to get a rope
around his hind legs
  has that descendant of stupid buf-
faloes never heard that trained elephants
can hold a wild one while he is being tied
tell him to call in the other elephants
hurry
  the man disappeared down the jungle
trail on the run sommerfield picked up
his heavy walking stick and followed more
leisurely but at a rapid walk
  before he reached the camp he could
hear the bellowings and trumpetings of
the great tusker as he struggled to break
loose from the bonds that held him now
and then he could hear the shout of one of
the natives
when sommerfield came into the
clearing of the elephant camp he
saw father eclipse of the moon
standing beneath a great tree he was
bellowing and growling his mammoth
head swung from side to side his ears
flapped and his tail lashed angrily
around him a group of natives in their
blue red bordered suits and black tur-
bans were busily engaged in getting in
each others way but keeping clear of the
elephant
  scions of generations of pariah hounds
shut up commanded sommerfield as
soon as he reached the group
  the men stopped their shouting and
waited for orders
  have you sent for the other ele-
phants sommerfield asked of nai kow
the headman of the camp who som-
merfield insisted was the living proof of
the soundness of the darwinian theory
  yes sir i sent six men to find them
and ordered them to come quickly nai
kows beady little eyes shifted as hespoke
  do you think he can get loose red
moon sommerfield asked the great
tuskers rider who had been darting in
almost under the elephants feet in at-
tempts to slip a noose over its hind legs
red moon was tall for a native broad
shouldered and muscular he was so
quick energetic and resourceful that
sommerfield thought he must have some
chinese blood in him
  sir last night i hobbled his front feet
and chained them to the big tree then i
tied his two hind feet to those two trees
i knew he would be like a cholera spirit
the white elephant

 today he roared and bellowed all night
and at dawn became even more angry
maal he pulled and snorted and puffed
like one of the fire wagons at chiengmai
he broke first one of the ropes holding his
hind legs and then after much jerking and
pulling broke the other i did not become
worried until he started to break the hob-
bles i have never seen an elephant break
a six ply rattan hobble but see two of
the strands have been broken
  while red moon was speaking father
eclipse of the moon was milling around
the tree snorting trumpeting and bellow-
ing he was fighting desperately for free-
dom he was moving so continuously
that it was with difficulty that sommer-
field was able to keep his eye on the
hobbles
  father eclipse of the moon had jerked
and twisted his feet so viciously that the
links of the chain had worn through two
tough pieces of rattan and it was only a
matter of time before the others would be
broken and then there would be trouble
the nine foot tusker was normally gentle
and docile but demented by the pressure
of the must glands on his brain he would
kill any one in his path
  as sommerfield watched the big
a elephant jerked back on his bonds
- until the chain was taut he
bellowed slapped the ground with his
trunk and curled the tip around the stray
ends of rattan he twisted and pulled so
viciously that the tough plaited hobbles
were wrenched almost out of shape
another strand broke
  ropes ordered sommerfield
  here sir said red moon
  sommerfield tied a running noose on
the end drew out a big loop and handed
it to red moon
  lay that on the ground there beside
his back feet if he steps in it jerk up-
wards and pull quickly
  without hesitation red moon ran in
close to the animals feet and dropped his
rope father eclipse of the moon kicked
viciously missing him by inches with a
stick red moon straightened out the
noose so as to give plenty of room for the
big feet
  get poles and beat him on this side
force his rump around over the noose
ordered sommerfield
  themenobeyed eagerly they pound-
ed beat and jabbed his hind quarters
with anything they could lay hold of
father eclipse of the moon reacted to the
punishment by bellowing the louder kick-
ing more viciously and straining to get
loose he was stepping on the edge of the
loop time and time again
  the men became excited and a little
careless one of them with a light bam-
boo got his pole too near the elephants
head father eclipse of the moon lurched
suddenly extended his trunk wrapped it
around the stick and twisted it from the
mans hand	i
  jump shouted sommerfield but it
was too late
  although the pole was wielded awk-
wardly it descended on the mans back
and knocked him to the ground in a
second the great foot was over his pros-
trate form ready to crush out a life and
grind a body to a pulp sommerfield was
among the men before the foot could de-
scend and he broke his heavy walking
stick on the animals toes the move-
ment of the foot was delayed a fraction of
a second during that moment nai kow
who had caught the mans foot jerked
him out to safety
  father eclipse of the moon robbed of
his prey became more violent and slashed
madly with his pole the men were al-
ready out of range bellowing and roar-
ing he whirled the pole above his head
and hurled it at the group his aim was
bad and the pole missed the men by several
feet he was still as far from the noose as
ever and another strand had been broken
  sommerfield ordered the men to try
again and red moon moved the noose
closer
  father eclipse of the moon lunged
backward again the fifth strand gave
way under the tremendous pressure
  run for your lives shouted sommer-
field

clark brockman
  the warning was useless the men
were already disappearing the britisher
knew that he was in greater danger than
the others he could not reach the cover
of the jungle before the tusker would be
upon him a house would be of no protec-
tion as father eclipse of the moon could
knock it to a pulp in one charge and som-
merfield could not climb a tree like a
barefoot native he looked for a tree that
was easy to climb and yet strong enough
to stand under the charges of an infuri-
ated elephant
  the rope shouted red moon as he
pointed to the rope hanging from a large
tying tree a few yards away
  sommerfield ran for it made all the
height he could on his jump and started
laboriously up toward the branches
something caught his legs and he was
lifted a full two feet it was red moon
with his hands under the soles of sommer-
fields feet he helped again thebritishers
hand caught the limb he raised his legs
and wrapped them about-it affectionately
  as he raised his chin above the branch
a wild trumpet of rage echoed through the
jungle sommerfield saw that the great
tusker had broken loose from the tree and
was gazing around as if bewildered his
trunk outstretched and his ears cocked
  hurry whispered sommerfield
the tusker caught sight of the
dangling figure and with another
trumpet charged
  red moon was coming up the rope like
a monkey sommerfield braced himself in
the branches reached down caught the
riders hand and with one jerk swung him
to the branch as the elephants extended
trunk caught the rope and snapped it as if
it had been a piece of twine furiously
father eclipse of the moon charged the
tree it shook but held again the
elephant charged
  he cant get us panted red moon
this will never come down
  the tusker tried again and bellowed
with rage
  in the distance sommerfield caught
cries of warning
  take your elephants away father
eclipse of the moon is loose flee
  father eclipse of the moon also heard
the cry and made off in the direction of
the sound as he passed a sapling he
snapped it as if it had been a reed and
disappeared into the jungle waving it
over his head
  both sommerfield and red moon sat
motionless listening to the crashing of the
undergrowth when the noise of the
charge was no longer audible they could
still hear an occasional trumpet and an
angry bellow even these sounds died
out in the distance slowly they came
down and as they did they saw the men
slipping from trees and emerging from the
surrounding wall of jungle
  nai kow was the first to arrive
  send for sewai ordered sommer-
field tell him to bring his poisoned
arrows and shoot father eclipse of the
moon tell him that i will give him ten
ticals more than the usual price if he gets
him today but also tell him that i do not
want the elephant shot full of arrows
just in the foot and just enough to cripple
him temporarily you understand
  kow chai-understood replied the
head man
  he turned to one of the men and gave
the orders telling the man to make all
possible speed
  sewai is not at home broke in a deep
voice
  sommerfield turned to see who was
speaking it was panya the aged and
shriveled spirit doctor who was some-
what of a demigod in the district because
of his supposed control over the legions of
evil spirits that daily harassed the jungle
people sommerfield had known panya
for years and had had long and interesting
talks with the old man on the subject of
spirits and exorcism panya was no
charlatan he was a real student of his
profession and honestly believed in his
amulets and formulas
  where is sewai asked sommerfield
  he has gone to shoot paa luang
chow rajaboots tusker who has been on
must for the past two weeks and has
the white elephant

already killed two men wrecked a village
and killed one of the princes best ele-
phants and gored several others as long
as paa luang only killed men and wrecked
villages the choio did not bother about
him but when he started killing other
elephants the chow became excited he
told sewai to shoot him immediately
that elephant is a devil at all times but
when he is on must he is worse than a
spirit tiger he will kill anything he
sees
  when did sewai start out to find paa
luang
  only about an hour ago he ought to
find the elephant today because when last
seen paa luang was not far away and was
coming in this direction
  sommerfield turned to red moon
  go find sewai and tell him i will give
him fifteen ticals extra if he cripples
father eclipse of the moon before night
  after a few questions as to where
sewai might be found red moon
started off hurriedly the camp
which had been deserted now assumed
its normal appearance the men sat in a
circle discussing the rage and fierceness of
the great tusker tie men told panya of
his terrible strength and how he had
broken loose the stories they told were
such wonderful fabrications that sommer-
field stayed to listen
  as the tale was nearing completion
boon the rider of a quiet female elephant
rushed up breathlessly
  bua kam calved this morning and the
calf is an albino he exclaimed she
would not let me get close to touch the
calf but i could see the hairs on his tail
they are white as white as cooked rice
  the group of natives stared at boon
as if he had announced the end of
the world they were incredulous be-
wildered stunned
  it is true nai som-er-fee he said
turning to the britisher it is true i
thought i was crazy when i first saw it
i rubbed the eyes i pounded the head i
looked again the hairs on the tail are
white and there are five toes on the
right front foot i saw them too his
whole body is pinkish and covered with
white hairs
  where did you get your opium
asked sommerfield
  nai som-er-fee i do not smoke opium
i sell my allowance of opium every month
it is true come and see
  sommerfield knew that it was possible
that the calf was a white elephant or
albino as the siamese word should be
translated but he also knew that the
chances against its being a white elephant
were more than a thousand to one if it
were a white elephant he knew it was a
startling event-an event important
enough to bolster up the tottering desti-
nies of the government he recalled the
letter from hodgkins unless the com-
pany can do something to ingratiate itself
with the government- ingratiate itself
if it were really a white elephant the com-
pany could get anything it wanted he
would not be discharged he would not
have to look for a situation in england
for a moment sommerfield saw a long and
pleasant career as a jungle walla stretch-
ing out before him and then put the
thought out of his mind why raise false
hopes
  nai som-er-fee i believe boon is tel-
ling the truth said panya the spirit
doctor many omens have foretold the
birth you have just witnessed the last
father eclipse of the moon is the young
elephants sire you have seen an exhibi-
tion of strength and power which to my
knowledge no elephant has ever dis-
played this morning father eclipse of
the moon went on must and at the same
time the young elephantwas born that
prodigious strength of the great tusker
was the strength of buddha the white
elephant will be as strong as his father
and the king will be as much greater than
other men as father eclipse of the moon
is greater than other elephants
  i have noticed other omens prob-
ably nai som-er-fee did not notice that
three days ago there was a large white
cloud in the eastern sky which took the
form of a white elephant the head was

clark brockman
fully formed and at first the trunk hung
down with a slight curl at the tip but as
i watched the trunk curled over the fore-
head as if the cloud elephant were saluting
the king as the sun set the whole body
of the cloud elephant was changed to a
deep pink which nai som-er-fee knows
is the real color of an albino elephant the
tail remained white long after the rest of
the body had been colored by the rays of
the setting sun and i doubt not that it
will be found that there are white hairs on
the tail
  it is true broke in boon
  and if his tail is white continued
panya he is a white elephant in spite of
any other qualities he may lack nai
som-er-fee has heard the old proverb
when buying an elephant study his tail
when buying a wife study her mother
that nai som-er-fee was the first
omen then that night there was a rain
the like of which has not been heard of in
this region for a hundred years there
was no stint to buddhas generosity i
have been told that your company floated
out logs that have been lying in the bed of
the me mai for over ten years that rain
flooded rice fields that were parched
and it will flood rice fields from here to
krung tape-bangkok-as it flows down
the river
  after such a rain as that to usher in
his representative would god buddha
give us an elephant that is only partially
white i have not seen nai som-er-fee
but i believe that the elephant is white as
boon has told us i believe that the new
king has great merit and that god is
showing his approval by sending an ele-
phant perfect in all eight points he is
also showing his approval of the company
by having his representative arrive in its
herd the company has great merit
ommerfield smiled in apprecia-
tion of the old mans corfipliment
nai panya how does this show
that buddha approves of the new king
the ancient tradition says that there
is a white elephant born in the kingdom
whenever a new king comes to the throne
-if that king has the approval of god
buddha it he does not have the approval
no white elephant is born the white
elephant is therefore the representative of
buddha some say that it is buddha
himself coming in the form of an elephant
but i doubt that that buddha did come
to earth once in the form of a white ele-
phant is beyond question-every priest
will tell you that-but that was many
years ago
  in ancient times the king sent princes
to escort the white elephant to his palace
a gorgeous hall was erected in the palace
grounds for his abode dancing girls and
musicians were in constant attendance
he was fed by slaves in splendid uniforms
who offered him food on platters of silver
and gold a body of priests were appointed
to chant prayers before him and also to
give him instruction in conduct and man-
ners singers from the royal opera sang
him to sleep he was treated as the
buddha himself might be treated
  but the late king forgot the ways of
his ancestors and the white elephants
were put in stables and lacked attention-
at least so i have been told he died a
young man but buddha is honoring the
new king and the birth of this elephant
proves that the new king has great merit
i have heard people say he was unworthy
because no white elephant was born but
now here is the proof of buddhas favor
who dares doubt now
there was a murmur of approval
when the old man finished speaking
after waiting a few moments the
spirit doctor continued
  some time ago nai som-er-fee told me
that there was no significance in names
he told me that i was not wise simply
because my name panya means wise
perhaps he will say that bua kam-
moon-white lotus-the name of the
mother elephant has no connection with
giving birth to a white elephant perhaps
he will say that nai boon the rider is not
lucky although his name means luck
  i am indeed lucky nai som-er-fee
said boon his frank young face all aglow
the white elephant

and his eyes shining with excitement
princes and nobles will come for the
elephant a hundred of the greatest
tuskers in siam richly decked with gor-
geous howdahs or gold embroidered trap-
pings will escort the white elephant and
i as the mothers rider will be envied of
all the king will give me a uniform and
maybe presents of silver and gold
  we shall go to see this calf and deter-
mine whether it is a white elephant or
not said sommerfield one look is
better than many omens nai panya
bai bai lets go lets go shouted
the men in chorus but boon interrupted
  nai som-er-fee i met a man who was
on his way to the temple i told him the
news and asked him to send the priests
here as soon as possible would nai be
willing to wait for them
  sommerfield was eager to see the cere-
monies that would be performed and
assented
  the priests are necessary said pan-
ya we shall all do obeisance to the
young elephant and then the priests will
say prayers for his health and wisdom
when they have finished i will chant
incantations to drive out all evil spirits
that may hurt him or cause him to become
sick every care must be taken for his
health else we may be severely punished
by the king if he should die before he
gets to bangkok we would indeed lack
merit the king will wreak vengeance
upon every one of us it is an honor to
have a white elephant for the king but to
have a dead one is disaster
it was not long before the priests
entered the clearing they came in
single file with the old patriarch of the
temple leading the procession immedi-
ately behind him was an acolyte carrying
his elaborately embroidered ceremonial
fan haversack and betelnut box behind
these came four other priests with acolytes
carrying their ceremonial equipment
  a group of novices dressed like their
seniors in brilliant yellow robes came next
last of all came the villagers men
women and children all in their holiday
attire they made a colorful picture
with panungs - trousers-and pasins-
skirts-of every color of the rainbow
many of them carried great silver bowls
filled with scented water and sweet smell-
ing flowers the priests were given the
place of honor in the group the men
mingled with those present while the
women and children formed a second
group a little distance away but close
enough to hear the conversation
  while the new arrivals rested nai panya
told of the omens he had noticed and then
boon described the young elephant
  bai said sommerfield when they
had had time to rest
  bai shouted the men and off they
started with boon leading the procession
sommerfield next and the others fol-
lowing in the order of their rank boon
took a trail leading to the stream crossed
it and headed for the salt lick about a
mile from camp he skirted the clearing
and started up the ridge behind it it was
broiling hot and the villagers straggled up
the path panting through the trees
could be seen the outline of bua kam the
mother elephant she had heard them
coming and was headed in their direction
  tinee dee quoi here is better said
boon
  the crowd protested they wanted to
see the white elephant they had not
come to look through the trees at the head
of an old one
  she is in a very bad humor exclaimed
boon she almost charged me this
morning when i went close
  an argument followed it was settled
by sommerfield who announced that he
with panya boon and kow the headman
of the camp would go closer to determine
whether or not it was really a white ele-
phant
  the four started forward quietly
  boomp
  bua kam slapped her trunk on the
ground so fiercely it sounded as if some
one had broken the biggest drum in the
village temple the four stopped short
behind them they could hear the frighten-
ed cries of two or three children

clark brockman
  mai dai it cant be done whis-
pered boon
  dai it can insisted sommerfield
  boomp warned bua kam
cautiously sommerfield made his
way through the undergrowth
boon was right behind him but the
other two kept timorously to the rear
bua kam continued her warnings until
sommerfield was within ten yards of her
and then let out a nasal shriek
  through the bushes before him som-
merfield could se the little clearing that
bua kam had trampled down in the
shade of a tree lay the calf it was of a
pale red color and seemed to be covered
with light fuzz its toenails were white
and there were five on each hind foot
instead of the customary four on its
tail the larger hairs stood out white and
stiff the eyes were closed so it was
impossible to tell their color but whether
they were black or pink made no differ-
ence the calf was an albino-a white
elephant a representative of buddha the
indubitable warrant of a favored king
  i think he needs water whispered
sommerfield see how he is panting
yes water he has no water god
buddha he hasno water boons whis-
per was hoarse as if he also needed water
we must bring water here on the
ridge there is nowaterand the little onecan
not walk down the steep hill she can not
carry him and will not leave him to get
water godbuddha ifheshouldperish
like a wild animal he darted noise-
lessly through the bushes to the place
where the priests were waiting when
sommerfield arrived a prayer service for
the little elephant was in progress seated
on a decaying log his ceremonial fan
before his face to prevent thoughts of
mundane things from creeping into his
mind was the head priest on the ground
before him with elbows on the ground and
palms together in the attitude of prayer
were the brown villagers heads were
bowed low to the ground or thrown back
with faces uplifted to the leafy dome
made by the great jungle monarchs whose
branches spread out between them and
nirvana
  prayer after prayer fell fervently from
the shriveled lips of the aged priest
  when the priest had finished his pleas
for the mercy of buddha panya the
spirit doctor took charge of affairs as
naturally as if it were a part of the same
service as indeed it was the priest saw
nothing incongruous in it why should
the people
  but panyas tactics were totally differ-
ent his was not the attitude of a sup-
pliant coming to a greater power for help
he stood before the spirits of the jungles
with shoulders back and head up he
called them by name dared them to lay
so much as a finger upon him who was
their master he reminded them that the
spirit he controlled was greater than they
singly or collectively he recounted his
marvelous deeds and threatened to bind
them and tie them for eternity if they
did not accede to his will
  he ordered all spirits of disease and in-
sanity away from bua kam and the white
elephant he called in the thirty-two
good elements which are necessary to the
health of men and animals alike spirit
after spirit was called upon and ordered
to perform certain duties
  the angry bellow of an elephant broke
through the stillness of the jungle it
was not bua kam it was from the op-
posite direction the animal trumpeted
and bellowed again the confident
haughty expression on panyas face
seemed to be frozen there he stared
incredulously in the direction of the noise
some jungle spirit was evidently dis-
puting his authority
  the crowd was in a panic they could
hear the crash-crash as the elephant
broke wildly through the jungle there
was another trumpet with one accord
they started down the steep path toward
the salt lick men and women dropped
the silver bowls and spilled the scented
water which they had brought to sprinkle
on the sacred animal the smaller chil-
dren were swung up to their elders hips
and carried off in the rush for safety
the white elephant

the trumpeting was closer panya was
among the first to seek shelter
  sommerfield caught a thick vine that
hung from the branches of a great teak
tree and made his way upwards boon
was right behind him halfway up
sommerfield stopped to laugh the
situation was in a way ridiculous he had
had many experiences with elephants but
he had never before been forced to climb
to safety twice in the same day after
all it was a pleasant interlude in the dull
monotonous routine of jungle life
they were well concealed in the
dense foliage when the elephant
appeared
  paa luang gasped boon it is the
chows elephant if he does not follow the
people he will kill the white elephant he
has attacked every elephant he has found
since he went on must we have no
merit we have no merit
  you are right said sommerfield to
himself we have no merit
  he had not allowed himself to count too
much on the change in the companys for-
tunes that would follow the advent of the
fetish but he had felt a peculiar exulta-
tion when he had satisfied himself that
the calf was actually an albino why
should hope be dangled momentarily be-
fore his eyes and then snatched away
  from his high perch sommerfield saw
paa luang crashing through a clump of
bamboos he was one of the largest ele-
phants sommerfield had ever seen he
was a stately beast that would make a
wonderful showing in a procession but
his tusks which were four feet long curved
inward so that they almost touched at
the tips they would be in the way of an
elephant working with teak logs but for
show they were splendid long black
streaks of oil oozed from the must holes
above the elephants eyes
  the elephant trumpeted again an
answering trumpet was heard boon
clutched sommerfields arm that trum-
pet was not from bua kam either it
was too far away the tusker stopped in
his tracks cocked his ears and felt the
air with his trunk he trumpeted it
was answered he bellowed and kicked
up the ground with his front foot his
challenge was again answered and som-
merfield could hear a crashing of trees in the
direction of the newcomer paa luang with
another growl charged through the jungle
in the direction of the white elephant
  boon your knife whispered som-
merfield throw it stop him
  as the tusker passed under the tree the
rider drew his heavy j ungle knife from its
sheath and hurled it at the animals head
the aim was good about six inches of
paa luangs scalp was opened to the bone
paa luang ducked his head hunched his
shoulders and backed as he started
forward again boon hurled a dead limb
which checked him a second time
  back worm shouted boon but a
trumpet from the other side of bua kam
held the elephants attention he trum-
peted and charged
 the head and shoulders of father
eclipse of the moon broke through the
jungle around the clearing in which the
young calf lay he passed the mother
elephant without seeming to notice her
and rushed on to the fight
  with heads up trunks curled tightly
between their tusks ears fanned straight
out from their heads and tails held high
and stiff the two tuskers rushed at each
other like two locomotives under full
steam their heads dropped low and
came together with a reverberating bang
  it seemed that one of them would cer-
tainly be stunned by the impact but both
went at the fight as if nothing has hap-
pened each animal strained and pushed
as he grunted and roared round and
round they went in a circle paa luangs
tusks were longer and although he could
not get them to the sides of father
eclipse of the moon he did rake them
back and forth across his chest moons
shorter tusks could not reach paa luang
so long as they kept head to head both
elephants strained with tails high and
lashing furiously
 phra buddha chow murmured
boon

clark brockman
blowing grunting and bellowing
the two elephants struggled at
first neither seemed to be able to
get an advantage but father eclipse of
the moon was stockier and could use his
weight with greater effect gradually
paa luang lost ground with a tremen-
dous effort moon pushed him back a full
foot at the same time moon ducked
his head and disentangled his tusks which
had been straddling the long slender ones
of his foe as quick as a cat he twisted
his head to the left and sank his right tusk
into paa luangs tough chest before the
chows elephant could take advantage of
his own unprotected side moons head
was back and their tusks were interlocked
at that game paa luang did not have a
chance his tusks curved together and
were so long that only at an angle could
they do effective damage
  again they struggled in a circle with
heads lowered straining and grunting
again moon tried to slip past his oppo-
nents guard to make another thrust but
paa luang lifted his head suddenly to
keep the short tusks from slipping free
so suddenly did both elephants move and
so fierce was their attack that the long
slender tusks of paa luang were broken
two stubs remained one a foot long the
other over two the ends were jagged
and sharp
  the maneuver had disengaged their
tusks moon with his head below paa
luangs lunged forward for a deadly
thrust but the short jagged tusk caught
him between the eyes and tore the skin
from his forehead and raked it back be-
tween the ears the heavy skull had pro-
tected his head and moon had sent a
second thrust into the massive chest
as moon drew back for a second lunge
paa luang backed and dropped his head
to the defensive again they maneuvered
in a circle bellows of pain mingled with
those of rage
  paa luang became desperate as he felt
himself being pushed back he exerted
every ounce of strength in a supreme
effort moon went back his hind feet
struck a decaying log and he faltered
paa luang was upon him in a flash moon
struggled to maintain his balance paa
luang caught a ragged tusk in his shoul-
der he thrust again into moons right
side and was making a third jab as moon
regained his balance and whipped his
hind quarters to the left paa luangs
jagged tusk raked moons leathery side
  like a demon moon tore into paa
luangs unprotected flank once twice
three times moon sent his tusks home
bellows of pain echoed through the jun-
gle then they were head to head again
tusks locked and heads lowered
  moons thick tusks were now between
his enemys broken stubs with a tre-
mendous effort he forced paa luang back
he shoved again and suddenly raised his
head his tusks fitted closely around paa
luangs neck moon seemed to expand
upward both elephants forefeet were
off the ground still moon was coming
forward suddenly he twisted to the
right paa luang was unbalanced and
fell to his side he did not move his
neck had been broken
  but father eclipse of the moon was not
through time after time he thrust his
tusks into his prostrate foe stamped on
him and knelt on him and stamped on
him again he seemed controlled by a
demon he was even more savage than
during the fight
  bua kam gave a quiet coaxing call
he stopped suddenly and faced her
bleary eyed and wild she approached
him fearlessly the call was repeated
she slipped her flexible trunk over the
wound on the fighters head and seemed
to tickle his ear father eclipse of the
moon swaying and heaving from his
exertions looked at her with dull stupid
eyes the quiet coaxing sound was re-
peated
  bua kam turned back to her calf and
ran her trunk over his little body as if
caressing him she felt the dry panting
mouth father eclipse of the moon fol-
lowed he too ran his trunk over the
little form but he did not seem to be
caressing it it was more as if he were
trying to decide just what it was bua
free wood

kam stepped gently aside as father
eclipse of the moon slipped his reddened
tusks gently under the calf with his
trunk across the little animal to hold him
firm father eclipse of the moon lifted
him from the ground held him high in
the air and slowly with bua kam at his
heels started down the ridge down to
water
  neither sommerfield nor boon moved
for some time finally the words phra
buddha chow slipped reverently from
the natives lips as sommerfield reached
the ground he noticed panya the spirit
doctor waiting for him
  did you see nai som-er-fee asked
panya
  i saw replied sommerfield
  it was buddha said panya the
strength of buddha broke the rattan
hobbles when father eclipse of the moon
tried to get away it was buddha that
brought him here to protect his white
elephant it was buddha that gave him
the strength to win the king has great
merit
free wood
 by leonard h nason
a great many houses in the basque
country of france have been built
 with what looks like second hand
lumber the beams of the ceilings the
supports of the barns and the balconies
that are the feature of every basque
farmhouse all show signs of having been
used before
  to the average observer this would
mean nothing except that the basques
were a thrifty race and had probably
built their houses from the wreckage of
former habitations once in a great while
however some visitor to the pays basque
discovers that these massive beams in the
ceiling these gigantic corner posts are
ships timbers
  the beams of the ceiling are mostly
stringers easily recognized by the scars
of doweling and notching where the
frames were attached in the center of
the room is usually a strake or a huge
two foot square timber that has served
some vessel as keelson one never sees
knees those natural wood angles that
are used to support the deck this is
explained by the fact that at the time
these houses were built the shipbuilders
were accustomed to use heavy ledges
instead of knees maintaining-and per-
haps rightly-that these ledges added to
the longitudinal strength of the ship
  whence came all this timber
  the writer set himself to find out the
writer likes to talk to basques because
they speak very wretched french and so
does the writer well then after a great
deal of asking the writer found a basque
who thought that he the writer was
english and wishing to insult him said
that the beams came from captured
english ships this was passing strange
the histories make no mention of the
french taking enough english ships to
furnish the entire department of basses
pyrenees with houses
  the basque swore that it was so he
said that in the napoleonic wars a man
lived in hendaye who was a great sailor
this mans name was pellot and he was
alive in  he defeated the english in
fight after fight and brought so many
prizes into saint jean de luz that the
authorities forbade him to bring any more
  it is said that a man could walk from
ciboure to saint jean across the bay a
distance of over a mile simply by stepping
from one deck to another it is these
ships that were broken up and distributed
piecemeal to any one who would cart
them away and their bones were put into
the supports of farmhouses
 the ice goes out
by frank richardson pierce
    a story of alaska in which honest men and
    crooks proposej but inscrutable nature disposes
the hand of winter was on the
north country the sap had not
started to run valley stream
and mountain in the grip of the
ice lay like something dead
  and then it changed slowly the sun
began to swing north and long before the
sap began to run or the first flight of
birds men began discussing the ice pool
  the ice pool
  not january  but the break-up mark-
ed the beginning of the northern year
welch and several others would handle it
this year they had handled it for several
years and given satisfaction the ice pool
was the great sporting event that sur-
vived the nome sweepstakes and other
dog racing events had lost their import-
ance had dwindled as nome itself had
dwindled but the break-up each spring
was the nearest thing to a lottery that
remained under the american flag

  sometime late in april or early in may
the ice went out men sent in their
money and with it the day hour minute
and even second they believed the ice
would go luck governed the contest for
no man could tell the exact hour the
man coming nearest to the moment of the
break-up won the pot less the expense of
holding the event
each spilled the contents of his poke
on the rough cabin table
enough he muttered to buy
twenty ice pool chances this year im
going to win each year ive come nearer
each year the pool has been larger but
this year i win
  dont be too sure atridge his part-
ner observed
  leach stretched himself and stepped
outside the air was almost balmy the
sky a deep blue the mountains stood out
the ice goes out

sharp and clear the sap was running in
the willows but then a willow is a foolish
sort of tree and frequently buds too soon
the creek on which their cabin was lo-
cated was frozen down to its gravel
bottom leach looked into the sky and
a peculiar hardness grew in the muscles
around his jaw a flock of geese was fly-
ing northward to some open body of salt
water a willow may be foolish but
geese know
  this year he repeated i win the
ice pool
  atridge did not speak for several
seconds
  i think he finally said i get you
but dont you mean this year we win the
ice pool
  yes if you want to go in on it-fifty-
fifty otherwise im counting on you to
keep your mouth shut
  im with you whats your plan
  we cant lose ive worked it all out
last winter when you thought i was
brooding and maybe had cabin fever i was
figuring to win the pool
  whats your plan atridge repeated
easy blow the safe in welchs store
and go down the river ahead of the break-
up what chancehas the marshal with
the whole country flooded i know of a
dozen cabins in the lower country where
we can hide out nobody will know
whether weve wintered there or just
arrived nobody knows were here and
we wont show ourselves in the camp
like most prospectors he spoke of any
thriving town as a camp originally it
had been a gold camp from it a town
had grown
  they camped on the outskirts of the
community a week later excitement
was on the increase it was late april and
money was coming from every part of the
world from traders and eskimos in the
north from trappers miners and business
men throughout alaska to men of poverty
and wealth alike who chanced to be spend-
ing their declining years in warmer
climates to some it merely meant
thumbing a bill off a large roll to others
it meant a sacrifice back of it all was the
sporting blood of another day prompting
them to take a chance whispering that
they had as good a chance to win as the
next fellow loudly they might declare
they knew they didnt have a chance but
the faint voice of hope whispered-
  but maybe you have
con welch opened up his place
of business to find the mailbox
crammed with envelopes one
larger than the other attracted his atten-
tion he opened it a small poke of gold
dropped into his hand with it a note
which read
  ice pool committee
heres enough placer gold to
  buy me twenty chances im
  guessing the ice goes out as
  listed on the accompanying pa-
  per i expect to win this year
  sure im sending this up by a
  si wash that i know is honest
  my address is klahowya landing

  from the lower river country eh
welsh mused coming by messenger
there was of course no date or postmark
hang it i wished that siwash had show-
ed up in daytime id like to have asked
him some questions about the lower river
country well leach heres hoping
twenty chances will give you the edge on
a lot of others but the man with one
chance often wins
  he opened a safe already crammed
with gold dust and bills added the con-
tents of the poke entered the name and
times in a large book and filed the letter
away
  men were already working on the ice
in the center of the river a tripod had
been erected just below it a wire had
been strung across the river on the town
side the wire was connected to a clock as
well as a siren when the ice moved the
tripod was carried against the wire the
clock registered the exact time and the
scream of the siren proclaimed the ice

frank richardson pierce
was going then the camp went mad
  the last of the entries arrived that day
the contest was now in the lap of mother
nature
  con welchs safe was closed and locked
until the great day when the winner
appeared to collect robbery the
thought never occurred to any one in
camp there hadnt been a theft in
years escape was too difficult in a land
where all movements of humanity must
of necessity converge at the neck of the
bottle-the steamers connecting the
country with the outside world
  no telegraph line reached the camp
and yet by a curiously circuitous method
the miners learned that the ice was be-
ginning to break far up the river white
horse sent word to vancouver and a
vancouver radio station broadcasted the
news a local set picked it up the camp
waited a day or two perhaps only a
matter of hours and the question would
be settled
  a low boom startled con welch he
opened his eyes and listened
  there goes the ice he cried and
rushed to the window the tripod had
not moved he rubbed his eyes and
waited must have been dreaming
that sure sounded like ice breaking
  he returned to the warmth of his
blankets and dozed off at six oclock his
telephone rang a voice came crisply
over the wire
  con this is kenmore speaking how
much money did you have in that safe
roughly twenty-five thousand dol-
lars why
  shes been blown get down here as
quick as you can
a mob had surrounded his store when
con welch arrived each man
 had made his guess on when the
ice would go out each felt himself rob-
bed of twenty-five thousand dollars the
men buzzed like hornets and they were as
greatly aroused
  ive got a dozen men circling the
camp kenmore the marshal explained
if theyve taken a trail out of camp
well catch them your place aint so
badly wrecked as it looks the job was
done by men who know how to use
powder but dont know much about
safes
  con nodded
  half the men in camp can use pow-
der
  even as they talked a deputy hurried
up
  weve found a trail it aint much
but they went out over the ice theres
at least two of em
  twenty men were standing about
ready for the trail and spoiling for a
chance to take part backed by authority
kenmore picked his men
  well travel light he announced
and have others follow us up with grub
were taking to the ice before she goes
  they fairly raced down the frozen
surface a half hour gained now was
equal to several hours hard work once the
ice was gone
  an hour later they caught the scream
of a siren behind them it was a sound
that never ceased to thrill them other
whistles in camp took it up and with it
came the ringing of bells and the crack of
pistols and rifles
  i wonder who won a deputy won-
dered
  it wont make any difference ken-
more replied if we dont overhaul the
crooks
  something cracked ahead of them
they ran swiftly and leaped an opening
in the ice water began to pour through
spreading slowly over the smooth surface
it would be a tough job returning an
hour later they reached boulder creek
and kenmore threw up his hands and
groaned they knew what they were
doing timed things just right weve
got to quit the ice
  theres a bend in the river one of
them shouted if we cut across it will
save something
  lead off the marshal ordered
  the roar grew louder first the ex-
plosive sound of breaking ice then the
grinding of millions of ice cakes as the
the ice goes out

flood waters lifted the ice bodily and
carried it toward the sea here it strand-
ed on bars and piled cake on cake until a
dam had been formed there it broke
through the banks and relieved for a
moment of pressure while the country
was flooded
  they crossed the bend in the river and
instead of the smooth surface they had
desired a churning ice dotted flood filled
the course to the banks they ran madly
taking turns at trail breaking helping
one another over the bad places min-
utes counted it was a tossup whether
they could cross the flat country ahead
before the water flooded it
  they cut across to the stream once
more and followed along the bank here
the river had broken through a low moun-
tain range after ages of effort walls were
of granite scraped by the ice of thousands
of years a panting deputy cried out with
excitement-
  look at that
ice had choked the gorge and the
river was climbing the sheer walls
but in the midst leaping from cake to
cake were two figures they seemed tiny
when compared with the vastness of the
breakup they moved with desperation
falling fighting each for himself but
working toward the jam
  one man looked up and saw the posse
but a greater danger confronted him ice
cakes were being sucked into a vortex that
poured through an opening in the jam
he judged his situation carefully leaped
at the right moment and was on the jam
proper he did not look back at his com-
panion but climbed upwards knowing
that if he gained the top and the smooth
ice beyond the posse had no chance
knowing too that if he failed the river
would demand its toll
  no word passed among the posse as it
watched they knew the ice these men
knew that the might of the river was
exerting tremendous pressure to overturn
the jam knew that in the end the river
would succeed
  one of the men gained the top the
other was halfway up for an instant the
leading man was outlined sharply he
waved his hand in defiance and far be-
neath a cake of ice weighing tons groaned
in agony then burst
  a man in the posse cried out at the
drama the river had won the whole
jam was moving cakes and blocks
shifted and the tiny figure of a man was
hurled into the stream an instant before
the jam overturned another dot a
thing of arms and legs fighting a river
remained on top of the shifting ice a
moment clawed for a niche on the bank
and then fell back the river with its
burden of ice moved on toward the sea
 the youngest member of the posse
stood where the jam had once held the
flood waters of an empire in check
  do you suppose     he ventured
no the marshal answered pointing
to a spruce log three feet through at the
butt it was a sound timber from heart
to bark but it was now a pulpy mass being
destroyed by the ice the only thing
thatll ever be found son is the gold nug-
gets and maybe the river will keep even
them the rest will be destroyed well
boys lets go back and report some-
bodys out twenty-five thousand dollars
eagerness to learn who won the pool
spurred them on long after muscles cried
for relief near camp a supply party met
them
  got the crooks one of them in-
quired slipping a pack from his broad
shoulders
  no theyve gone down with the ice
say who won this year
  kind of an empty victory the packer
replied according to con welshs book
it was a feller named leach
  in the distance the ice ground its way
to the sea

two birds of evil omen
  at jason mellishs dingyclut-
  tered desk in jasons cluttered
  and dingy office that bleak
february day one old man was
sitting with another not so old and
what the two were plotting dipped into
crime so monstrous that even for the
love of money it seemed hard to think
men would conspire to such ends a
prime pair they made in wickedness this
old ship owner and this shellback sea
captain of the hard fisted deep water
school
  done exclaimed jason in a voice
harsh as the rasp of a file of course it
can be done come come set everything
taut and shipshape bohannon and take
a bingo chance when theres a little
job like this to do a job with a full cargo
of cash in it for your own hand youre
the devils own boy to do it
  bohannon-captain isaac bohannon
of the seven seas-leaned back in his
complaining chair and with the heel of
his calloused hand rubbed bits of plug
tobacco in his other palm for his black
pipe a charged silence hung between
the conspirators for a long moment the
captain stared at the window-panes
against which drifted the fog of south
street only a dull light-for it might
have been four of the afternoon-seeped
through those grimy panes but even that
cheerless glimmer revealed the office as
one of the old type now passing away

a novel of a condemned windjammer and its
shanghaied crew on a tempestuous voyage
around the worlds worst corner
  pictures of an-
cient windjammers
that once had flown
the mellish house
flag hung askew
against the walls
on top of an obso-
lete safe lay tat-
tered copies of
lloyds register
from sailing ship
days two or three
half models a little
crude but revealing
the love and care
of forgotten lob-
scousers who had
used their watch
below to carve
them depended
from rusty wires
a whales jawbone
stood in one dafk
corner and on
shelves reposed va-
rious dustycurios-
a balloon fish two
varnished flying fish
affixed to boards a full rigger in a bottle
chinese brass gadgets a pierced metal
ball with a lamp inside it odds and ends
of trinkets
  the same bleak wintry gleam that fell
upon these trifles showed captain isaac
bohannon as a bull necked bucko of
sixty-odd going a bit bald with dangerous
looking pale blue eyes under bushy and
graying brows the eagle beak of his
nose dented by a scar that wiped across
the prominent cheekbone gave witness to
one of his many battles his thin gash
of a mouth twisted a bit as he made
speech
  yes im the devils boy to do it if i
mind to but if we miss stays theres
one hells flamgs
long stretch in quod
for both of us not
as i care how long
you count cell bars
youd be doing a
hundred years hand
runnin if you got
your dues the
captains voice was
spotted with hostil-
ity as he filled his
pipe and fired up
its myself im
t h i n k i n  of he
added with a huge
outblowing of
smoke no jails
for mine thankee
clew up re-
torted mellish with
a pull at his sagging
lip loose over a
white bristled and
unshaven chin
clap a stopper on
all that capn
dont you go
worrying about jails
  the old ship owner squinted from be-
hind his steel rimmed glasses which were
mended with wrappings of black thread
for in his squeeze penny philosophy a
farthing saved was better than two
earned
  stress o weather and a rotten hogged
old chump of a ship off the pitch o cape
horn-whos to prove it
never can tell the captain growled
with sullen smoldering eyes somebody
might blow the gaff and bring charges
wont be anybody to bring charges
when its over-
  yes i know theyll all be to davy
jones and gone that is if it works

george allan england
right but theres sometimes a slip in
these little barratry games they dont
always wash some scut-god stiffen
him-might make a fetch of pullin
through and shoot his gab
  the ship owner shook an uncombed
head his gesture was dismissive of
peril
  the long drill round the roaring horn
-thatll take care of all hands he
mouthed while his pale lips slewed into
an avid twitch come on capn dont
hang in irons
  i might hang in a rope if-
  theres no if to it we can always
count on ten months o bad weather off
the horn youll make it by the end of
april thingsll be piping then the
horn-shell take care of everything
she might take care o me too
bohannon retorted with splenetic em-
phasis
  how so when youre safe ashore in
buenos aires
 ah you mean i see hmmm
thats better the captain admitted as
their two lines of understanding now
began to run more in unison he leaned
forward immense of shoulder in his hulk-
ing pea-jacket so thats the lay but
if i quit the ship
  whats to hinder your deciding youve
got to put in at buenos aires for repairs
whats to prevent your getting sick
there fever or-
  how can i get sick to order de-
manded bohannon with some dubiety
hells bells never been sick in all my
life-exceptin sick o ship owners the
captain grimaced bitterly about his well
chewed pipe shank and if i slipped
some spig doctor a few dollars to certify
i was hove down hed maybe have me in
a clove hitch
  a man might break a leg some way
mellish expounded or get himself hurt
not too bad if there was cash enough in
it for him eh
  yes thats so the captain heaved
a deep breath and smokily brooded i
get your drift well-
  youre my man then
  i aint sayin - yet might be
though-if 
silence stretched tensely between
the two conspirators a silence troub-
led only by the dull rumor of truck
traffic on the gutty drizzly cobbles of
south street the blurred hooting of
steamship and ferry whistles in the river
a dirty day that congruous with the
business now in hand
  if what suddenly asked jason mel-
lish under breath eager to reach the
marrow of the bargain
  if what why you dried up bundle o
sea tripe if you double your offer thats
what
  double it my god capn the
ship owner quavered horribly discounte-
nanced where would i come in then
as if i gave a hoot in tophet i dont
care where you come in-except in jail
theres my terms and im goin to stick
to em
  youre driving a hard bargain
capn the ship owner whined a won-
derful hard-
  hard hell bohannon railed upon
him youre a fine old pirate to be belly-
aching about hard bargains you are
the glint of some ancient enmity some
perhaps more recent grudge flicked his
pale cold eye his fist tattooed with a
blue foul anchor smote the cluttered desk
here youre askin me to take a rotten
old choppin tray of a skysl yarder and
sail her to the devil put my own neck in
chancery for mebbe a ten year bit in jail
drownd at least twenty-five men-
they wont be men not the kind well
ship only common jacks
  human beins anyhow and i reckon
most of em wants to live as bad as a
sculpin like you youre askin me to
drownd em and lose the ship and all
for why
  partly answered mellish so you
can have ten thousand good dollars to salt
away in your pocket for your old age
stop your gammoning a devil of a
lot you care about my pocket the cap-
tain flung at him with an objurgation
the roaring horn

hereto though if its anythin itll
be a fatter wad of money than ten thou-
sand by the lovely ratline itll be
twenty and not a soumarkee less its
what youre goin to salt in the bank
insurance money on hull and cargo youre
thinkin about all right im yours to
oblige but mind now twenty thousand
and paid on the nail too before so much
as ever a moorin lines cast off
 hard terms bohannon wonderful
hard terms
  yes and this heres a wonderful hard
game
  the captain put a curt period to the
discussion he blew thick gusts of smoke
  take it or leave it go get a better
man than i am cheaper-if you can
  lord bless me its extortion but-
well-
  done eh bohannon demanded
  silently old mellish nodded and for a
moment silence held them once more in
that dingy spider web where murder
wholesale was a-planning
hen all at once the old ship owner
spoke
  its my last job he declared
rubbing a mottled and veinous hand
toadlike flesh across the flabby bags of
his cheek sink or swim im going to
try it after that i lay up its coming
to me something tidy is- he sought to
salve his conscience-after years and
years of a losing game ive got to have
something to retire on now that im
broken down from keel to truck i cant
starve
  not hardly with all you got laid by
   pon honor im a poor man mellish
affirmed for years now ive been on a
lee shore with no way to claw off
  have eh why didnt you go into
steam then like the rest of em have
mostly
  the ship owner sketched a vague ges-
ture
 couldnt he murmured some
way couldnt get a handhold in it im
of the old school the old windjamming
school the worlds passed on and left
me hove down capn i belong back in
another new york and another age o
ship owning
  pathetic aint you sneered bo-
hannon well what cant be cured
must be insured-right up to the trucks
and lost at sea
  he tamped his pipe with a horny
thumb and added
  i dont want none o your guff not by
a sailful i dont whether you take your
canvas off and lay up or not dont make
a damns odds to me all as matters is
business right now a bargains a bar-
gain and the least said the better
youre right there anyhow no
long tongues wanted in this little
deal
  weve both got to keep em damn
short the captain affirmed to save our
bacon but lets clew up and see the
color of some cash though i know you
fair hate to fork over the rhino it aint
for nothin that old jason mellish has
got the rep of bein so close hed sell his
grandmother to make sausage skins of
her cash in advance yunderstand
lets have a stain o rum on it and get to
work
  the old ship owner bent hauled open
the lowest drawer of his desk fetched out
a squareface and two thick dirty glasses
he poured rum slopping a little as his
hand shook one glass he shoved toward
bohannon
  the captain -spatted his pipe sparkily
into the cuspidor and gripped the glass in
a hairy tattooed paw
  well happy days huskily said the
old man
  and plenty of em bohannon echoed
gulping his liquor at a draught
  the ship owner drank more slowly
a little of the rum guzzled down his un-
shaven chin and dribbled to his waistcoat
untidy with grease spots reminiscent of
slobbered food
  ah he exhaled setting down his
glass that suits me to the ground
good stuff a raw day with a thick o fog
like this
  if you werent so damn stingy you

george allan england
wouldnt pay a nickel to see an earth-
quake growled the captain refilling his
pipe youd keep a decent fire in that
rusty old stove o yours then itd be
better here but never mind how he
asked cannily how about the c-a-s-h
cash	
xts not for myself i need this
 maintopsl haul the shipmaster
remarked slowly confidentially
theres some one else
  is eh i never heard tell youd been
spliced
  i havent its my nephew
  so
  yes man dear ah theres a lad
for you and mellish nodded vigor-
ously i love that lad i do
  the captains small blue eyes widened
that old jason mellish had ever loved
anybody but himself or could love was
news for bohannon news of the most
amazing
  my sisters boy the old man mur-
mured only sister i ever had she
died when he was a baby hes twenty-
six now a fine figgerhead of a man you
can bet and risk it if you ever saw an
a-l upstanding lad its him knows
his ropes with the best of em no better
capn ever took a ship out of new york
and brought her back again got his
papers in sail and steam too clean
square brave knows his work that
boy fine navigator more than half a
doctor too smart
  he dont favor you much then
gibed bohannon squinting at the ship
owner in the slowly fading wintry light
but avast talkin about him what i
want to know is when do i get some
rhino in my fist to bind this here bar-
gain
  a fine clean lad mused the old man
its the sorrow of my life he dont-
wont-have anything to do with me
wont eh ah i think better of him
for that now
  but he will he will when ive got a
good fat bank account to show him i
aim to set him up for life
  without the captain sneered mali-
ciously o course ever lettin him know
where the money come from and where
is he now this here precious nephy
wandering hes a seafaring man
as i told you the ship owner went on
unpercipient of bohannons mockery
and a rare one too good in both sail
and steam you wont find many like
him
  something of old mellishs vulturine
expression had faded almost a certain
softness shadowed his blinking eyes
strange though it seemed that jason
mellish could care for any man the truth
outstood that in his withered heart some
queer and twisted niche sheltered love for
this nephew of his he leaned back and
in fond reminiscence spoke softly
  hes a rare fine fellow now im telling
you
  yes yes the captain indifferently as-
sented but heave ahead to business
speakin about the money now-the
twenty-
  went deep water when he was only
sixteen pursued old jason and think
of his having his masters papers in both
sail and steam you dont find many like
that his age if hed only cruise in and
see his old uncle once in a month of
sundays-
  shows damn good judgment he
dont testily observed the captain
pouring himself another drink a stiffish
one twenty thousand for the job
thats what i want out o you by the
salt sea yes sir in advance too every
penny of it
  i dont know where he is now
  the old ship owner doggedly pursued
his thought
  last i heard he was chief officer on
a blue star freighter from boston to
havre and-
  for the love o god mellish stow the
gammin about that blessed nephy o
yours bohannon interrupted and
rammed it down with a stiff oath i
didnt come here to yarn about your
nephy its the job i want to talk about
that and the dinerol
the roaring horn

tes yes yes to be sure assented
 old jason arousing as if from half
a revery the job thats gram-
matical well then you know the ship
the china girl aint she
  yes thats right the china girl
last one ive got now been a good one
in her day too
  devil of a long time ago her day was
maybe maybe but she was good
once shes a deepwaterman all right
wooden bath built three skysl yarder
fourteen hundred tons used to carry
passengers too well fitted with cabins
for em and-
  i know ive seen her a many and a
many a time been aboard her too in
callao and hong kong but she was
parish rigged even then and dirtier n a
hog you always did go in for penny
squeezin bohannon affirmed sucking
at his pipe i wont drill on that part
of it though question is how is she
now must be pretty rotten by god-
frey diamonds yes
  pretty ripe ill admit a trifle un-
seaworthy the ship owner answered
a trifle hogged as ive said framing
is weak but she looks fairly good last
survey a fitter iknew put the thing
across and didnt look too close masts
and rigging a bit weathered but-
  but shell make the horn at least
yes shes not so bad itd raise any
suspicions trying to send her round old
cape stiff to valparaiso all the keen
buzzard greed and craftiness had returned
to jasons baggy features as he sat there
in the dimming light that filtered through
the one window obscured by dust and
cobwebs he drummed with knuckly
fingers on the litter of his desk i can
get her clearance papers and fix up the
insurance right enough get a cargo
too of sorts
  mmmm shes always been a jinker
though aint she
  well not so good for luck thats a
fact
  dog luck is what shes had the
captain asserted chronical black luck
always leakin goin ashore killin men
shes been loaded to the hatches with
hoodoo and no mistake i reckon the
only one proud of her is the devil-and
you same thing mind how she killed
that man young feller named humason
in a blow off hatteras winter of ninety-
eight or nine
  as i was saying the ship owner
ignored the reminiscence there wont
be any question-
  that was a hard case bohannon
continued he got killed on the lower
foretopsl yard as i recollect it chain
sheet of the lower topsl thrashed round
looped itself over him tore the whole
belly out o him innards and all ship-
mates got him down from aloft but he
went to glory in five minutes just been
married too afore sailing a damn bad
take enough to jink any ship and make
it hard to sign a crew
  dont you worry about a crew jason
assured him a bit grimly ill get a
crew all right if youll go captain
  ive said i would aint i that is
when i see the color o your cash where
is this here precious hell wagon of yours
anyhow
  tied up at pier  stapleton staten
island been there grounding on her
beef bones ever since she came in last
september from burma with jute
haporth of tar and paint will fix her
up enough to reach the horn after
that-
  well let her have it mustnt spoil
a ship for a haporth o paint and tar
but mind im a hearty feeder and the
captain vastly erupted smoke even if
youre forelayin to drownd all hands
but me dont scamp the stores not for
the cabin
  i wont therell be grub enough to
last to the horn for you anyhow
mellish assured him cant afford to
stir up suspicions by not providing every-
thing just as if she was going all the way
round to valparaiso ill tend to that
part dont you worry
  get your cargo mellish
  right i will
  and crew

george allan u england
  yes yes
  ill pick up a few hands myself too
theyll be proper good uns and
bohannon grimaced in a manner intended
to be humorous his scar tautened with
that grimace
           there was tinkers and tailors
           and sodjers and all
           they all shipped for sailors
           aboard the black ball
he quoted the old sea rhyme thatll
be us all righto
  pick as poor trash as you can sug-
gested jason ill do the same any
riffraff will do just so you can work ship
with it we dont want to sacrifice decent
lives
  conscientious aint you sneered
the captain well youre one fine
double riveted copper bottomed old
hypocrite ill say but never mind
when do we sail
  call it about a fortnight from today
right and-my twenty thousand
youll get it cash in hand when the
tugs alongside not before old
jasons eye glinted craftily im taking
no chances of your jumping ship with it
and leaving me on my beam ends under
the circumstances i couldnt very well
recover
  youre damned right you couldnt
laughed bohannon sly old barnacle
aint you but dont let it chafe you i
wont throw you by crook im honest
i am burn me yes and when im
hired to do a job i do it yes sir even
if it means sailin pretty dogfired close to
the wind like this time and this here
job is sure like a winters day-short and
dirty ill take my davy on that
  i dont know mused jason whats
a few riffraff lives after all too many
bums in the world anyhow as for the
china girl id rather she came to a
proper sea burial than have her really
get round to the coast and sell her to the
salmon fisheries in frisco or the timber
trade between there and chile or have
her cut down to a coal barge or a scow
besides my needing the money
  dont get mushy growled bohannon
its the coin youre set on like iron
nothin but well youll get it by the
law clink your shipll get her bring-up
at old cape stiff dont worry shes as
good as on the rocks of the roarin horn
this very minute-or to the bottom
thats all now you know where i
berth now ill pull away he stood
up stretched mightily and jammed a
peaked cap on his baldish head so
long
  a fine lad to raise money for fair
means or foul the old ship owner re-
verted sagging in his twine patched chair
by his desk finest that ever spliced a
halyard or cussed a raynick worth
fifty gutter jumpers-a hundred if
theres a better sailorman on all the
seven seas than roderick tyson i dont
know where youd cross his hawse
  already at the door captain bohannon
baused turned round his gray and
upshy brows contracted sharply
  what he demanded whatd you
say his name was
  tyson answered the old shipmaster
roderick tyson why know him
do you
  er-no i thought-thought you
said hyson well ill bear away and
bohannon was gone
  the door closing behind him left
mellish still engloomed among the musty
memories of other and better days
  on the twisty unclean stairway cap-
tain bohannon paused to relight his pipe
the grip of his jaw was very grimly set on
it with the match flame revealing his
scarred nose and cheekbone the hard
salience of his chin as evil a light as
ever glinted lurked in his pale blue and
dangerous eyes
  smash my eternal old bobstay he
muttered well by the law clink can
you beat that know him do i well
by god
  he flung down the match savagely
trod upon it and with sundry profane
mutterings clumped down the stair to
mingle with the crowd along the drizzly
sidewalk of the waterfront
the roaring horn

chapter ii
to the suthard
snow sodden with a gray and pelting
rain spread its dour carpetover the
pier at stapleton the february
day lowered in consonance with the ugly
drama now being there begun as the
china girl-her cargo mostly second
hand steel rails for the minas de juncal
railway-put out to sea
 old jason mellish stood near the
stringpiece of the pier watching his last
ship clear for what he felt was her last
passage in silence he waited with thin
shoulders hunched up an old wine colored
tippet about his neck and chin his thread
wound spectacles blurred with rain did
any emotion lurk behind that baggy and
masklike face no man could have fath-
omed its tenor
  there the old man watched one of a
little group of farewell sayers-a steve-
dore a couple of roustabouts even a
reporter who was getting a fairish story
from this sailing of one of the very last
skysail yarders unmoved he remained
there thinking
  thats a proper good cargo ive got
aboard her theyll rack her the steel
rails will lord bless me rack her won-
derful hard
  to his muffled up ears drifted the pluffy
coughing of the tug that hauled his ship-
how unwillingly she moved-out toward
the gray and rain scourged channel
before his eyes slowly passed and faded
the black wall sided bulk the soaring
masts and spreading yards of the old
china girl silent he stared and glum
even a man like jason mellish may he
not find it grips his heart to send a one
time gallant ship at long last out to her
death and what may his thoughts be
if any thoughts he have for them about
the doomed crew there aboard of her
  captain isaac bohannon richer by
twenty thousand dollars in yellowbacks-
money that by hard shifts mellish had
raised for him-stood at the vessels star-
board quarter stood and glowered in
silence at the old ship owners dwindling
figure bohannon had received those
yellowbacks from jasons mottled hand
in the cabin some ten minutes before the
old man had stiffly clambered down the
gangway ladder
  all the while bohannon had watched
the springs being taken in forward and
aft the singling of the head and stern-
lines and lien their casting off the com-
fortable bulge of that money in his breast
pocket under his rain gleaming oilskins
had given him good cheer with the
final let go forrard and the let go
aft he had felt the last bond severed
whereby any possible loss of that fortune
might overtake him now the money
was his all his irrevocably his and he
was rich richer than ever he had hoped
to be the hard heart swelled within
him and he smiled as a wolf perhaps
might smile
  youll get your moneys worth you
damned old son of a one he was thinking
as the ship drew away a very demon of
malice gleamed in the pale blue of his
eyes your moneys worth and then a
lot if you knew if you only knew-
  he leaned elbows on the snowy rail
spat into the swirling sullen water and
sardonically grinned
  youll know soon enough by gumbo
but not too soon the captains thought
continued not so soon that you can
stop it happenin
  and with viperine relish he fell ponder-
ing about a certain letter he had written
old jason a letter he had left with a
friend in brooklyn to be posted one week
later not before thoughts of that
letter must have given bohannon extraor-
dinary satisfaction for they gendered in
his bull throat certain hoarse rumblings
that stood him in lieu of laughter
  youll be all ends up old boy when
you get that there letter the captain
savored his reflections a little of the
merry hell youre ladlin out to others
youll get it in your own dish eh what
hove on your beam ends entire thats
what youll be i reckon any score i got
against youll be all paid up and youll
be paid too for your murderin plot-

george allan england
paid in full signed sealed and delivered
when you do know man above id
nigh hand give half the twenty just to
clap my eyes on you then 
  through gray rain curtains the wharf
now was fading from bohannons sight
laggardly dispersed the little group
there began melting away still how-
ever the ship owner stood at the string-
piece a motionless and muffled figure
but all at once he raised a hand in signal
of farewell not so much farewell to
captain bohannon as to the old and
dying ship last of his line
  in answer to that signal the captain
lifted his own hand and shook it that
hand though was a fist then turning
inboard bohannon went below to drink
a glass of grog and brood evilly triumphant
on the cynic thing that had been done
to gorge his spite by pondering upon the
letter predestinate one week from then to
shatter jason mellish
under a stiff quartering breeze the
china girl toward four bells of the
afternoon watch was logging off a
matter of seven knots flurries of wintry
rain whipped a gray heaving and moder-
ate sea that cradled the old girl as if to
lull her for her final rest
 doomed though bohannon meant her
to be still he had had her put shipshape
under the hard fisted persuasion of the
mates-william furlong and peter mayes
-the waterfront scrapings which for the
most part comprised that scurvy crew
had been kicked and cuffed horsed and
pushed and rustled about from station to
station to bring matters into some sem-
blance of order
  even while still in tow this work had
been going on and by the time the tug
had dropped her off ambrose lightship
the china girl had begun to assume a
certain air of reputability much had
been to do all loose objects on and
around the decks to be secured for sea
gear coiled down and made all clear for
running
  out of the sixteen men rated as a b
hardly more than half knew one end of a
ship from the other even in cleaning up
decks stowing away the hawsers and
making the anchors fast with sea lashings
the intelligence of many had been over-
taxed hence oration of no gentle tone
from furlong and mayes a lubberly
gang of canalboat sailors that
  all thumbs though some of the comple-
ment were still they could pull and haul
after a fashion when the gear was put
into their hands and presently out of
chaos emerged a certain kind of order
this despite the fact that some of the
haymakers were already seasick and not
only got in each others way but also in
everybodys else
  with tongue and fist the mates drove
them waking up their crowd of shiners
with a will
  come on now lads masthead that
yard walk away with them halyards
and hesitantly the ponderous yards
inched up the masts with complaining-
blocks and creaking parrals yards were
trimmed sails sheeted home and gear
coiled ready on pins and rails two or
three of the clumsiest farmers had to be
manhandled for not jumping quickly
enough but no great damage was done
captain bohannon on the poop mean-
while watched with some ennui the
scene all too familiar through years of
having witnessed such in wind wagons
more often disreputable than not
  at last they got the china girl under
topsails and courses and finally set the
maintopgallantsail
  thats about all shell carry the
captain opined and so for the present
they let it go at that
 all hands were mustered aft as
- soon as the gear was reasonably
shipshape a sorry looking com-
pany indeed they were take it by and
large as they lined up a tough crew-
wharf rats waterfront bums wastrels
pierhead jumpers it seemed quite
obvious that some had left their countries
for those countries good the countries
being several some had come aboard
without sea chests or dunnage bags
the roaring horn

having naught but the generally ragged
clothes in which they stood and shivered
others possessed a few rotten slops
that had perhaps one time belonged to
sailors now dead and had been foisted
upon them by shore harpies nearly all
were stony broke the boarding masters
and bowery doggeries had seen to that
some seasick others with hangovers
from having been recently three sheets in
the wind on bootleg a miserable gang
they stood there shuffling on the snow
slushed deck growling and cursing to
themselves unshaven and grimy faces
foul teeth rum bleared eyes-as an en-
semble of human ugliness a fine picture
  captain bohannon addressed them
from the break of the poop his words
were few but pithy
  you sons o sculpins listen to me
some o you never been off soundins and
dont know deepwater law mebbe so
im tellin you ive washed my face and
hands in a bucket o sea water and by
that token land law and all is left behind
im the whole sea breeze now the full
sail and the double reef all in one and
you aint thumb high to a flatfish get
me if any o you cockabaloos got any
contrary notions dont try em aboard
me or ill come across rugged and youll
damn soon find the wind took out of
your sails entire im ridin this one
and you can lay to that solid thats all
and thats enough
  having said which bohannon turned
and went below for still another glass of
grog
the mates on whom devolved
the duty of choosing watches eyed
askance their bewildered and booze
fuddled raw material
  damn few lobscousers we got in this
lot im thinkin remarked peter mayes
second mate he a black liverpool irish-
man short and bowlegged a hard and
accurate hitter with belaying pin or fist
good thing we got a cat aboard even a
dirty alley cat for a mascot sure well
be needin one
  great gang o farmers all right as-
sented furlong even if most of em
wasnt still beered up carryin cargo
they wouldnt know the truck from the
kelson bout all the seamanship they
got is to know block an fall booze when
they see it drink it walk a block an
fall but well make em into proper
shellbacks you can bet an risk it well
learn em or well kill em by god
thus spake william furlong first male
of the china girl a six foot six red
headed man mauler was furlong with a
countenance rendered even more sinister
by a bullet wound on the left cheek
he had got that wound in a savage mu-
tiny some twenty years agone off the
coast of sumatra
  the bullet had stopped in his mouth
after having knocked out two teeth he
had spat the bullet into his hand just
before having with his naked fists killed
the mutineer who had fired it ever
since that day the nickname lead-
spitter had clung to him the wound
had puckered in such a wise as to draw
his lip into a perpetual snarl even in
his calm moods which were few furlong
looked as if about to commit homicide
now his snarl revealed carious teeth as
he repeated-
  well learn em seamanship by god
or well kill em
  hell of a gang o haymakers to take a
ship round old cape stiff commented
the boatswain
  anthony saltash his name was and by
birth a p i that name and his long
seafaring had given him a monicker less
printable than accurate usually with the
adjective old prefixed and a real old
salt he was for all his seventy odd years
tough as pig iron well dusted by weather
and wind a barnacle from heel to head
  now as he stood there a squab figured
oldster in knee boots reefer and peaked
cap he sorrily surveyed the crew
  a healthy lot the body bulk of em
he appraised but theyll be healthier
afore were through up wid em or dead
and he worried at his stringy gray mus-
tache turnpikers
  aint above half a dozen sailormen

george allan england
in the lot complained peter mayes
damn town rats look a them dagoes
an dutchmen nigger too an if that
one there aint a rooshian finn ill eat
my souwester everybody knows the
kind o luck a ship carries with a finn
aboard sure thats nigh worse n a
preacher or a woman
  barrin that gammy foot newfund-
lander we got to the wheel now lead-
spitter judged and a few more ill be
tarred if the lot of em is worth the
powder to blow em to hell how in
blazes we ever scraped up a bunch o
sodjers like this gets me
  same here mayes agreed he spat
a great deal of tobacco juice over the
lee rail now-as the sails were drawing
well-inclined toward the gray smooth
seas boiling past then after a pause
that feller in the focsle him the old
man had brung aboard last night all
barreled up sure i wonder if hell be
any good
  looks like he could hand reef and
steer leadspitter opined looks like a
good sailorman from truck to toes a
complete hand id call him a grand
built fine grown young feller and a blue
water man or im no judge soon as he
gets on an even keel well turn him to and
soon see by judas priest
  hope he comes out o his square
bender afore long the irishman re-
marked we need good men worse n i
need a drain o rum this blessed minute-
and thats bad enough lord knows
work enough to do and a plenty he
glanced aloft at the swelling belly of the
maintopsail well well preach the
boot and belayin pin gospel to em all
right well convert em or sure nobody
elsell never have the chance to now
then here goes to choose watches eh
an a sweet proper job itll be at that
jumpin jupiter yes sir
something more than an hour
later with the china girl heeled
well over on a south southeast
course and with the rain abatecj to a
penetrant drizzle the young husky of
their discussion dragged himself out of a
bunk on the starboard side of the forward
deckhouse which served as a forecastle
  for a few minutes he sat on the bunk
edge elbows on knees and head between
hands in the dazed anguish of the tor-
ment that throbbed his temples vague
and cold light through the deckhouse
ports showed him as a rather heavy
shouldered man in patched dungarees
and worn down jackboots it revealed
his crisp set chestnut hair tousled all
awry and-on the crown-blood stiff-
ened but of his face hidden by well
corded hands nothing was visible
  some few dim figures lolling in bunks
or on the wooden benches at either side of
the table cast hardly a glance at the suf-
ferer incurious in their misery they
left him to his own
  presently the man perceived the slow
roll of the ship the slithering whisper of
the sea mustering at least enough
strength to look about him he blinked
with bloodshot eyes saw his mates their
dirty canvas dunnage bags a sea chest or
two dingily battered his forehead knit
in webs of puzzlement
  what ships this he demanded in a
dry hoarse voice barely louder than a
whisper whats her name and where
bound
 no one answered one of the men
there present was a st pierre-miquelon
frenchman who had scant english
one a swede who had little more a
third the russian finn constitutionally
silent then there was a weasel faced
cockney sucking at a limp cigaret and
near him a stolid beaky nosed old ger-
man his cropped hair gray as a badger
hands blue with tattooing chin fringed
with a stubble of white beard a lump-
ish cross eyed negro blent with the deeper
shadows of the forecastle only one man
of all this flotsam appeared to take heed
of the sufferer and this one was perhaps
most unprepossessing of all-an east
side gangster and gunman now nursing
bruises recently acquired
  this gangster had found it prudent
after a chatham square battle to stand
the roaring horn

not upon the order of his going but to go
at once fate had led him to stapleton
the china girl had offered a haven of
refuge he had made shift to stow away
aboard of her but so clumsily that
hardly half an hour after the watches had
been chosen leadspitter had discovered
him hence these bruises on the
dodger as was his elegant title in his
own world
  what ship and where bound re-
peated the man with the bloodied poll
still no reply
  well are you all deaf and dumb
the frenchman shrugged indifferent
shoulders under his striped gansey
the finn lighted a pipe of willow wood
ingeniously carved yawned with yellow
fangs and fell a-smoking
  a fine bunch of swabs you are the
sufferer gibed sweeping them all and
severally with his contempt if i had
you aboard o my own ship id soon have
something out o you
  ah dont get shirty the cockney
retorted gorblimey its only another
billet in sail an wot odds vhere to too
soon to be funkin it mytey we all got
to stick it now
  the shanghaied man blinked stupidly
at the londoner half seeing a pale face
with reddened eyelids and with a sickly
com colored wisp of mustache then he
perceived a water bucket on the table
and his eyes brightened water ah
  he got up unsteadily staggered a bit-
for he had not yet got the feel of the ship
the slant of the deck-and seizing a tin
cup drank deep gurgling draughts he
drank still again with the greedy thirst
of fever
   ot coppers eh laughed the cock-
ney you eynt the only one perish
my pinkies no well drink earty
though well all need more than water
fore were through with this cos were
goin round the orn thats wot an
if you eynt never been round the orn
gawd elp you thats all i got to say
what demanded the shanghaied
one horn round the horn no
impossible
  fact mytey an you cant op it
now so it eynt no use to grouse abaht
it an that
  my great god gulped the man and
turned toward the port door the
horn no
he breath sawed between his
parched lips as he jerked the door
back admitting a gust of raw and
damp air to the stifling fetor of the deck-
house
  hey you snarled the gangster with
a garnishment of oaths shut that door
you poor boob
  the man turned with hard knuckled
fist
  look out i dont shut you he
menaced
  the gunmans eye gleamed from the
shadows but he ventured no retort a
moment the shanghaied man narrowly
measured him with a look that for all its
inflamed pain held steady then he
stooped out of the house and banged the
door to
  damned cattle he spat if i had
em on mine id clew and cat em quick
enough	p
  reviving a bit under the stimulus of
the fresh salt edged breeze he made way
to the high bulwark just abaft the break
of the forecastle head and stood a minute
looking off to leeward little enough
information he got there boiling tangles
of foam gray rolling surges sullenly fad-
ing into mists told him nothing save that
-though how he had come there not at
all did he know-he was already far at
sea only the immense and primal soli-
tudes of the regardless ocean met his gaze
  the jokes on me all right he mut-
tered if i was a booze fighter i could
understand it but-
  he raised a hand to his head a spe-
cial focus of pain there and the feel of
clotted bibod wakened nebulous mem-
ories
  batted me by gad he exclaimed
ah now-
  vaguely as through these same mists
shrouding the atlantic some colorable

george allan england
outline took form of what must have
happened he recalled having left his
own ship the steamer lyndon castle
lying at pier  east river that had
been at night but what night how long
ago he could not tell somewhere at the
back of his mind uncertain memories
wove he seemed to have approached a
subway station with purpose to go
uptown to a movie then-but though
film flickers palely irradiated the dark
places of his mind nothing grew coherent
there
  he rubbed his wounded head once
more
  batted me he growled took me
abaft all right and maybe dosed me
with knockout drops into the bargain i
wouldnt so much mind being capsized in
a fair fight but this well by the mighty
typhoon somebodys going to pay for
this thats sure
still unsteady on his legs-hard-
muscled through the dirty and
ragged dungarees that now encased
them instead of the trim blue he last re-
called having worn-he made his way aft
his gait for all its weakness revealed
him as a sailor only a sailor meets the
deep sea roll under his boots as he met it
he passed the galley the sailmakers and
boatswains quarters and the carpenters
shop all in the forward house on which a
boat lay bottom up purposeful was his
going
  no one gave him any heed two or
three raynicks were sweeping clumsily
coiling braces a couple of the more
experienced with greenhorns to help them
and be cursed were busy lashing spare
spars that lay along the deck why
should any notice him dirt and misery
were they not too common aboard the
china girl to excite even a passing glance
  with the walk and set up of a true deep
waterman hesteadfastlykepton instinc-
tively he cast an eye aloft he saw a few
men-the best these-placing crows
nests or pudding bags on the mainstay
forestays and crosstree horns
  getting the bagwrinkle on her he
thought he and knew it prophesied a long
passage
  the ship he sensed was dingy and ill
found with slovenly irish pennants
flickering from her gear aloft and geordie
patches spotting her canvas nothing
truly shipshape and bristol fashion here
yet outraged and suffering though he
was still something stirred within him
some recognition of the beauty of mast
and sail that not even times decay and
the neglect of man had quite been able to
obliterate loftily sparred built on
graceful models of old days the ship still
met her ancient comrades wind and sea
with something of her one time joyance
  the shanghaied man breathed now
more deeply as with rucked up hair and
smoldering eyes he trod the scarred foul
deck he passed the main hatch came
abreast of the main fiferail and still pro-
ceeded aft there all at once a harsh
voice hailed him
  here you where the devil you
goin
  the man stopped short peered from
beneath contracting brows he saw a
huge red headed lumbering figure with a
scarred cheek advancing upon him from
the weather side of the big iron watertank
just abaft the after hatch
  heave to there where you goin
going the shanghaied man re-
peated the word going aft sir
  what for was leadspitters sum-
mary question
  i want a word with the captain sir
oh you do do you well this aint no
time for questions get along forrard
the eyes of the shanghaied man com-
menced to glower in his head for a
moment silence fell silence save for the
thudding swish of waters along the hull
the muffled plaints of the old ships creak-
ing in the seaway into that silence
shocked seven metallic clangs struck by
the wry leg newfoundlander at the wheel
followed by seven from the bell stand at
the break of the forecastle head-seven
bells of the afternoon watch leadspitter
ordered again
  get along forrard i tell you this
the roaring horn

aint no private yachtin cruise by judas
priest you look like a seasoned shell

  mr furlong there
at sound of captain bohannons
- raucous voice the mate turned he
glowered up at the break of the
poop where now the captain stood pipe
in mouth and hands on rail
  yes sir
  send that man aft here
  sour mooded leadspitter made a surly
gesture he ordered-
  come aft here you
  answering no word but very grim of
face the shanghaied one climbed the port
ladder and like a sturdy son of anak
stood before the old man leadspitter
followed him up
  you want to see me eh the captain
demanded round his pipestem his pale
blue eyes evinced something of the qual-
ity of a cat with a cornered mouse
well what say
  yes sir
  what about about your ratin as an

bohannons hard slitted eyes revealed
cold fires i think youre still drunk by

  hells bells the captain interrupted
his voice fining down to a snarl of poison-
ous menace harkee now and he
drew a step nearer on the snow slushed

hawse again you whelp
  the muscles of the shanghaied man
stiffened he opened his mouth to speak
again but bohannons fist caught him
flush on the curve of the jaw with a crack
like the kick of a mule
  stunned he reeled backward over the
rail he hung there a second then
dropped to the top of the water-tank and
lay inert on the iron
  leadspitter clumped down the ladder
plucked tyson from the iron tank and
while bohannon sucked his pipe and
cursed dragged the insensible body to the
forward deckhouse
  he jerked back the door heaved
tyson in like a sack of potatoes and
slammed the door shut again
  round one quoth the mate and
dusted off his hands and laughed
chapter iii
boat ahoy
a plain of slow heaving glass ruf-
fled only here or there by cats
- paws the sea stretched to vague
shimmering afternoon horizons of heat
a sea of luminous and melting turquoise
that was of ultramarine and lapis-lazuli
patched with jasper and malachite and
golden pulsing absinthe all a-shimmer
under skies of glamourous and phantom
blue that overarched the undulating play
of color
  under the burnished drench of a merci-
less tropic sun-a broadcast rain of molten
gold-the china girl now lay almost be-
calmed there in   west  
north some eight hundred miles almost
due east of porto rico she was making
only slow headway what little breeze
fitfully whispered abroad upon the sea
was mostly up and down like a dogs
foreleg in sailor parlance
  baffling light airs hardly stirred the
courses and topsails now hanging from
the jackstays her summer suit that had
replaced the heavy weather canvas under
which the ship had cleared and that
barely gave her steerage-way as the
china girl rolled gently in the idle swell
her reef points lazily rippled sleepy
weather
  captain bohannon would have done
better to have made almost for the
canaries there to have picked up the
northeast trades then to have hauled
his wind aft and to have driven nearly
due south but he had had his own ideas
and now the ship lay nigh becalmed to
the souring of his temper-were that pos-
sible still more-and the sullen weariness
of all hands
  leaning over the quarter rail bohan-
non stood in dirty shirtsleeves and smoked
with staccato puffs that betrayed his anger
the roaring horn

  damn this calm he growled and
this hells flames bunch o farmers too
of all the beachcombin lousy swabbies
ever i commanded-
  his evil mood was heightened by memo-
ries of how that morning when he had
seen peter mayes kick dago viterbo for
working his broom athwartship instead
of fore and aft while washing down the
deck of how mayes had demanded-
sure is there anything under gods
blue sky you can do right you burgoo
swillin son of a whelp
  i one good paper hanger on de land
viterbo had most surprisingly retorted
you like i do fine job paperin your
cabin
  whereupon mayes had fetched him a
blow that had sent him skirling for back-
talk and had earnestly assured the son of
italy that the only one proud of him was
satans own self
  of all the bushborn muttonheads
pondered bohannon damned hay-
makin sons o sea cooks aint half a
dozen a-l sailors aboard us all the rest
o these here thick skinned clodhoppers is
tarred up with the lazy stick theyd
oughta be kicked to death by cripples
thats what quicker i get clear o this
ship and leave em all go drownd off the
horn the better shelp my god
with jaundiced eye of spite and
venom he surveyed the china
girl and the work now going on
for the most part with inept clumsiness
the watch on deck indeed was as far as
it dared largely doing only government
stroke which is to say just putting in
time soldiering on the job bohannon
glowered at paavola the finn now at the
wheel to which from time to time he
gave an easy spoke a pale and sweating
figure in the stifle of the wheelhouse
  he regarded with misprisal some of the
more expert who were making sennit
knotting rope yarn for spun yarn making
sword mats for chafing gear not even
the competence wherewith saunier the
miquelon frenchman and the big red
bearded dane tondern were coach
whipping a spare sheerpole relieved his
mood evil eyed he watched them
working with canvas tar spun yarn and
serving board and as he watched he
smoked and chewed curses on all hands
  keel hauled is what theyd ought to
be he bitterly affirmed his scar con-
tracting as his gash of a mouth snarled
up god stiffen em the sons o scaldies
  no very pleasant ship to be aboard of
was the china girl and that was living
truth from the seams of her holy-
stoned decks stewed and bubbled pitch
that smeared the soles now mostly naked
of all who trod them a sickly stench of
bilges arose from the forepeak cock-
roaches had begun to swarm and even
rats driven up from below by the intense
heat had commenced venturing furtively
on deck this despite the ravages of the
slit eared and filthy cat which humphrey
chubbock the newfoundland cook had
fetched aboard in new york and which
now snarled and spat at all with a veno-
mous temper almost equal to the cap-
tains own
  from the galley while bohannon
watched and listened a clink of tinware
and coppers sounded as chubbock messed
with grub few wanted on the sweltering
ship chubbock had to labor under diffi-
culties what of weevily biscuit salt beef
so hard that the foremast hands had nick-
named it sole leather tea flavored with
roaches rotting potatoes and other skulch
  as chubbock worked he was singing to
himself the irregular gusts of noise that
served him as music suddenly fell silent
as he stoked his range into that silence
issued a sailorman out of the forward
deckhouse his tough skin powerful
hands manner of glancing aloft all
marked him as a seasoned lobscouscr
the vigorous modeling of his head his
bitter and steady gazing dark eyes strong
beard and rich tanned sunburn made him
an arresting figure as open throated and
with muscular bare arms he stood gazing
over the tropic sea searching for any sign
of breeze
  in dogs wool and oakum singlet and
dungaree trousers with naked feet thrust

george allan england
into pitch smeared shoes there he stood
and looked about him yearning for a
capful of wind
  hell of a situation this is tyson
vented his thought becalmed on this
old wagon when every hours one hour
more i dont get even up with bohannon
and his pretty pair of bucko mates
then he relapsed into a smoldering
silence turned aft and made way toward
the galley somewhat bruised about the
neck though he was and with a faint
greenish purple patch reminiscent of an
extensive black eye roderick tyson still
made a fine figure of a man he breathed
largely and looked steadily though his
body was held captive the heart in him
was scathless gait and bearing showed
none of the shuffle or cringe that some of
the other poor wretches manifested
fight enough and plenty still remained
in tyson
at the galley door tyson paused
h and with something like a smile
listened to chubbocks song-a
mournful ditty about shipwreck and
southern seas and girls that were left be-
hind
  what do you know about girls old
tindercrack demanded tyson
  hello roddy exclaimed the new-
foundlander dat you by
  who else and how do the girls fit
with you
  gals fits wid evveryting in dis here
world the cook affirmed smearing a face
brown and wrinkled as an old sickle pear
with a cloth that did him duty for a
sweat rag dish towel and all on his
right hand he had only a thumb and little
finger which he used nipper fashion like a
crab ever since dem dere garden of
eden days if you can find anythin as
stands clar of gals tarmentin its a
quare thing ive had many a hard fuss
wid women i have man dear
  you look it laughed tyson
 dont i eh many a hard smack
ive had wid the judies best way to
keep a loose leg is go furrin an nivver
come back twas a woman as knocked
out most o my teeth by and anodder as
lost me me fingers you aint nivver
yeard dat yarn but i aint goin to spin
it today chubbock grinned gummily
dat d take too lang just now when i
got a little spurt o singin on me an
you dont need  advice lang o petti-
coats ill take my davy you had pliny
truck an dealins wid em yourself
blamed little answered tyson while
chubbock sat down in the galley door on
an onion crate so crossed and wired that
it resembled an ancient roman chair
women dont mix very well with salt
water
  right fer you i nivver seen a woman
at sea yet as didnt bring on a wonnerful
rookus one way or anodder
  the cook nodded gravely while tyson
produced a pipe and lighted up tyson
had got this pipe and some tobacco with a
few shoddy clothes from the slop chest at
extortionate prices to be stopped out of
his pay
  a martal cold smack is what women
alius brings knotty wedder dey fetches
an no coddin you women an parsons
whistlin fer a breeze tearin a flag an a
dead carpse in de cargo-dems ahl
tings id nivver go a-nigh
  go on tune up again smiled tyson
id rather hear you sing than philoso-
phize youre a rotten philosopher but as
a singer ive heard worse what about
your song
  well layve me see chubbock began
but all at once vibrated a cry-
  sail hoi
it was tondern the red bearded
dane who happening to look up
from his work at the sheerpole had
seen something afar and thus reported it
  where away sounded bohannons
voice from aft
 bout tree pints on de stabboard
bow sir dat look like a smoke sir
smoke eh then after a pause in
which the old man located the smudge for
himself all right and silence fell again
   twas de like o dis about my song
began chubbock but tyson turned away
the roaring horn 

walked to the starboard bulwark and for a
minute stood gazing off in the direction
tondern had indicated
  what ye make of it by the cook
demanded
  dont see anything but a little smoke
well smoke or no smoke what odds
and chubbock went on with hisculinary
labors and his wooing of the muse
  the smoke continued to increase to
drift on a little easterly fan of breeze that
presently began ruffling the sun shim-
mered ocean
  on the quarter deck leadspitter
squinted with an ugly eye at that far
drift
  shes cornin up thick now by jolly
bohannon commented that there
smoke looks to me like it meant trouble
yes sir agreed the mate that
aint no steamer thats a ship afire or
the like o that if it aint by judas
priest i never see one
  get me my long gun
  yes sir and leadspitter went
down the poop ladder to fetch it
  back again in a couple of minutes with
the biggest telescope aboard leadspitter
handed it to the old man bohannon
scrutinized the smoke with a certain
interest then passed the glass to lead-
spitter
  see what you make out of it
  thats a ship afire sure sir the
mate reaffirmed after intensive study
but shes the devil and all of a long ways
off what dyou think sir stand down
for her and see what we can do in the
way of rescue or salvage
  bohannon shook his head
  we got no time to be gallivantin all
over the ocean to pick up fools as aint
got sense enough to keep their ship from
burnin up on em he decided and
as for salvage out here not a chance
aint nobody can haul us to looward
for not standin by and thats a fact
muttered leadspitter no way to prove
thats a ship afire
  right theres plenty o these here
soogie-moogies aboard us asd like to
make trouble in port but they cant do
nothin so let the ship burn by jolly
if thats what it is let her burn-what
odds
  by this time a little stir of interest had
moved the watch on deck and such of
those below as were not sleeping -out
from the deckhouse lagged a few ex-
hausted dishevelled men hatchet faced
an toon-he had been a taxi driver ashore
-and cultan the rock scorpion once a
bumboat -man at gibraltar lounged
along the rail together with broadfoot
the negro gorley the cockney the finn
paavola and jubal tabry he of the
gammy leg tyson watched too and
from the carpenter shop looked out the
mild huge mustached face of chips 
solomon moon like chubbock moon
was a newfoundlander his especial
pride lay in the boast-
  im a grandfader in seven places i
am so
  now like the men on watch who stole
an occasional glance at the smoke they
centered all attention on that far off
happening with sun dazzled eyes they
blinked at the drift of dun vapor that
smearing the southwest horizon gave
hints of some sea tragedy there voices
murmured
  ship afire wot wish to gawd twas
this blinkin one hanything for a
chynge    gee that must be a
hell of a lot o good money gone blooey
when a ship burns up    say if a
guy could find a boat with everybody
gone off an left it like dat- this from
the gangster-dey might cop a lot o
good hooch an stuff huh    oh
boy she sho am burnin somei thus
sam broadfoot the cross eyed negro
bohannon now sent tondern
aloft with a glass bandoleered over
his shoulder for reconnaissance
lay aloft to the foretopmast head
he ordered and have a look at that
smoke lets see what you make out
from his lofty perch the dane care-
fully took an observation
  well how bout it called the skipper
  nuttin but smoke sir the danes

george allan england
voice drifted down through the brazen
heat nothin else in sight sir
  all right lay down
  some poor gozaroos havin it pretty
knobbly over dere judged moon
same as wem like to get afore wem to
port agin
  how so asked tyson
  you not knowin an you a sailor-
man the carpenter exclaimed us
wid a cross eyed man aburd an you not
knowin wem in fer a hard punchin
tyson laughed
  of course he agreed of course
you might laugh an you might make
a joke on it moon affirmed but i
niver de divil iver seen a ship wid a cross
eyed man aburd as could hold a straight
course wem goin to have it bad some
o doze odd times or im way off de
line
every ship catches it first or last
right me son tis a proper hard
life seafarin ye been follerin it lang
quite a while tyson fired his pipe
y aint ralely de owners nevvy is
you now
  yes i am straight goods
  an you layve de old man knock you
sinseless off de poop nigh to hells alley
an niver done nothin about dat the
carpenters mild eyes widened howlin
swile cats me son i cant fadom out
dat
  tyson shrugged and rather grimly
smiled
  only a plain damn fool strikes back
at an officer aboard ship he remarked
in hardly more than a murmur itll
all come out in the wash chips when
we make port dont lets talk about it
please
the eloquent smoke banner
gradually faded on the far south-
western horizon still the idlers
watched it sucking at pipes spitting
lazily speculating who the victim might
be and ever idly creaking the old china
girl rolled with slow pendulum swings
upon the sea of molten emerald and azure
glass
  the little easterly fan of air that had
sprung up offering some hope of relief
once more died away not even wetted
fingers held on high could find a hint of
breeze restive grumbling the crew put
in a weary time bohannon between
nipping rum and cursing made himself
venomously ugly a few flying fish
flittering aboard were welcomed by the
cat-the only man aboard permitted to
walk the poop on the weather side with
the captain lying out on the martin-
gale saunier the miquelon frenchy
reported a pilot fish believed by sailors
to be a sure sign of a shark hanging about
the ship this caused uneasy bodings of
a death on board among some few
  indolently the off watch men yarned
smoked talked of wreck and peril
watched an occasional filmy purple portu-
guese man o war trailing its poisonous
filaments through the clear brine the
advent of a school of porpoises leaping
with swiftly graceful joy aroused fugitive
interest frenchy having sighted some
bonita came inboard for a harpoon and a
coil of heaving line from the boatswains
locker he succeeded in striking a fairish
specimen but when the meat was tested
as usual with bonita by putting a silver
coin into it the silver turned black
wherefore the fish had to be flung over-
board and curses followed it had the
bonita been good it would have made a
welcome addition to the ships wretched
tucker for wretched enough it was in
all conscience and daily getting worse-
all save in the cabin
  the after guard theyre gettin the
good stuff all right grumbled hook
visaged antoon the ex-taxi driver aint

the swift night of those southern
seas engulfed the world the watery
world where the china girl lay idly
wallowing although with every ripple
and breath of air they trimmed the
yards still she made barely headway as
one more day of her death journey came
to its end
  from deckhouse and cabin skylight
gleamed vague glows binnacle and
running lights made three blurs-white
garnet emerald-in the gloom a wraith
in the star flecked night paavola the
lookout man lounged on the forecastle
head the spectral pale eyed face of
karlstad the swede half illumined by
the binnacles sullen glimmer hung at the
wheelhouse window dark figures moved
along the still hot decks voices mur-
mured from the carpenter shop around
the door of which lounged a few hands on
their watch below issued jerky and stri-
dent chords from a consumptive accordion
noah landerry the p i rated as sail-
maker was sitting on a wooden bench
there lanternlight played uncertainly
over his gaunt features as he whinneyed
out that lusty old favorite
     in amsterdam there lives a maid
     mark well what i do say
     in amsterdam there lives a maid
      an shes the mistress of her trade
      a-rovin a-rovin since rovins been my ruin
      ill go no more a-rovin with yon fair maid
  atta boy one approved walk
back on er another hayve aeed
wid de rest part of it by chimed in a
third
  landerry turned his quid and con-
tinued 
     i placed my hand upon her knee
     mark well what i do say-ay-ay
     i placed my hand upon her knee
     says she young man youre rather free
      a-rovin  a-rovin since rovins been my ruin
      ill go no more a-rovin  with you fair maid
  as the old sea song proceeded in all
its unexpurgated vigor leadspitter cursed
even such light hearted diversion as this
bout with the muses his ominous bulk
lounged a shadow among darker shadows
on the weather poop leadspitter was
hating all hands aboard that night but
most especially was he hating tyson
the muscular and bare armed shanghaied
man brown and bearded and unafraid of
him filled him with poisonous antipathies
  theres intrest runnin up on that
son of a one all the time leadspitter
dully reflected as he spat overside
  to him it was almost a personal affront
that tyson was turning out so well doing
his duty like a proper seaman offering no
occasion for assault and battery this
certainly was something of a grievance
to the mate
  if that laddibuck d only say some-
thin or do somethin id soon preach the
belayin pin to him shelp my god
leadspitter cogitated id jump down
his throat just as soon as helld let me

george allan england
ill learn him a lesson yet even if he has
got his masters papers somewheres else
he aint got nothin aboard o this un 
  here now lay the vital point of lead-
spitters spleen against tyson the mate
felt inimical to all superiority felt dis-
countenanced and put down by any of
his betters and that tyson was de-
cidedly one of his betters not even he
could deny marlinespike seamanship
was about the limit of leadspitters
ability but rumors had reached him and
well he knew that tyson was possessed of
mysterious mathematical heights whereof
leadspitter knew not even the names
  the best that leadspitter could do in
folding latitude was to use the old sloven
way of working with the constant of 
 sometimes as he well knew such
reckoning might put a ship six or eight
miles out and that on a lee shore in hazy
weather might be an infernally serious
matter good enough for a collier as
the old phrase has it is not good enough
for a skysail yarder going round the
horn
  i got no masters papers leadspitter
sullenly reflected never can have all
along o these here damn fool mathe-
matics and than again ill learn him
mathematics if ever he falls foul o me
ill learn him stronomy hell be writin
books about the stars after he sees all of
em i got packed in my fist
  thus did tysons superior knowledge
engender viperish hate in the mind of
leadspitter thus did the mate dream
of vengeance there on the china girl
which herself seemed a ship o dreams
upon a dreaming sea and somewhere
off there to westward in the night under
the silent wondering stars still lay the
mystery of what that day had brought
to pass
  toward two bells of the middle watch
a timid breath of air stirred the ocean
and presently began to breeze on a bit
from north northeast soon hauling more
from the eastward the idle canvas
bellied into a white cloud aspiring toward
the sky as the sails filled and drew the
china girl commenced shoving her cut-
water through tiny spats of waves now
building
  under the ships forefoot waters began
to curl white and astern flecks of evasive
phosphorescence gleamed winked and
faded as if the milky way itself had been
shaken to a froth of stars one hour and
with a moderate breeze the old wind-
jammer was on her course again on into
the south that waited to destroy her
gently reaching along before a
	fair following breeze the old
china girl was logging three knots
or four the smoke of breakfast a-making
wafted from charley noble coppers
clanked the scent of even cockroach and
chicory coffee gladdened the hearts of
men
  aloft serving the main topgallant stay-
rotten and perished like much of the gear
-roderick tyson looked abroad upon
the sea of splendors he knew that
despite all this toil humiliation abuse
life still was good his eye caught some-
thing a speck a far and tiny atom on the
ocean off to southwest at this he
squinted a moment then called down to
peter mayes on the quarter deck
  small boat ahoy sir
  whats that demanded the second
mate boat you say
  yes sir
  where away
  on the starboard bow sir
  mayes scrutinized the sea but from
that lower position could sight nothing
he went below for a glass this brought
the drifting object into his range of vision
leadspitter came up too a moment
later and took a long look as the ship
gradually forged nearer
  thats a boat right enough he
affirmed surly as if the presence of the
boat constituted a direct affront to his
majesty
  sure that must be off the ship we
seen burnin yesterday judged mayes
anybody aboard her sir
  looks like one man anyhow here
have another sight at her
  thats right one man at least
the roaring horn

now-hes wavin a signal i can see
him good
  well reckon we got to run down to
him
  without callin the old man sure
wed lose all o twenty miles by pickin up
that feller we could just fail to see him
couldnt we
  hell no growled leadspitter not
after that whiskered whelp o misery
tyson reported it theres plenty
aboard here asd like nothin better than
to jack us up for it after we made port
his scarred face contracted to a snarl
we got to run down on her damn the
luck i say
  and the old man
  last thing he said afore he turned in
was not to call him for nothin short of a
typhoon whats more i reckon i got
authority to shift the course without
none o your lip
  leadspitter snicked the telescope shut
ill take this on myself he decided
and commanded keep her off three
pints to westard port fore brace
shake a leg there you bushborn cod
haulers port fore brace
  the watch on deck jumped to the
order mayes slacking off the weather
braces so handled the ship swung
round till the wind was abeam on her
starboard side with the yards trimmed
accordingly thus she stood away toward
the vague speck that alone upon the
vast heaving breast of old ocean broke
that immeasurable solitude
  tensions of interest keyed up all hands
along the rail dishevelled men leaned
peering discussion speculation waxed
keen that interest leaped suddenly to
high intensity when a few minutes later
leadspitter took another sight
in amazement the mate exclaimed
hells hinges what dyou think now
if my eyes aint gone plumb bad-
what is it sir interrogated mayes
you said twas a man eh well it
aint
  what is it then
  what else could it be if it aint a
man
  sure you dont mean a woman sir
thats what i do a woman shelp
my god
chapter iv
      a problem in petticoats
  as this intelligence ran through the
ship disparate emotions came into
- play some of the roughnecks
laughed cheered even essayed a word or
two of ribaldry for to the run of sailors
as to jailbirds-both being reft of feminine
society for long stretches-a woman makes
more elemental appeal than to normal
free citizens
  certain of the more seasoned men
though frowned and shook anxious
heads picking up anybody at sea is it
not risky business chubbock rich in
lore and proverb muttered
        save a drowndin man at sea
         an hell prove your enemy
  an a woman my glorianna added
solomon moon a woman an a parson
dats bound to be ten times worse
leaning against the batten of the
forward main rigging there in the cutting
sunlight old solomon voiced his fears
ive see bad luck happen a ship
manys de time from losin a cat over-
burd specially a black un likewise
anybody exceptin de old man whistlin
at sea an a hatch cover put on deck
upside down yes me sons he crisply
declared an ive see wracks alang of
hayvin a draw bucket into de ocean
tearin a flag sewin sails on de quarter
deck an a hundurd odder tings but
de most an worst bad luck ive see from
parsons an women aburd ship
  speaking thickly by reason of his quid
he told of jonah ships and sailors and
especially how during one spell of long
continued heavy weather a certain mis-
sionary had been adjudged a j inker on
the golden cloud bound from st johns
newfoundland to ceylon one dark
night off the cape of good hope that
unfortunate individual had mysteriously
vanished

tured the sea with tobacco juice

of misogyny only the more inflamed
solomon
  no sir he indignantly repelled one
allusion i aint got a tousand wives an

to kape our wedder eye lifted now me
sons you wait an see
  even aft anxiety touched leadspitter
and peter mayes
  there aint no good cornin o this
the mate growled i hate like thunder
to have petticoats aboard this is likely
to get the wind of us bust up discipline
hell bent an crooked as cargo id a
damn sight rather carry oil an dynamite
or quicklime in a leaky ship than what i
would a woman
  same here mayes agreed this is
goin to put a kink in us sure as guns
were liable to go a lee bad his black
brows contracted all his short hard
bow legged figure expressed anxiety
sure twould ha been a good job if
wed gave that there boat the go by sir
  damn f i dont think youre in the
rights of it-for once leadspitter as-
sented his lip asnarl by judas priest
i would have too if id known but
its too late now devil burn the boat an
the woman too i reckon he added on
a tone of great uneasiness i better go
down an tell the old man as a job
ive seen others i liked better
down in his cabin isaac bohannon
was at this moment lying stretched
out in his berth pipe in jaw he
lay there a scarred eagle beaked old
ruffian of the seven seas shirt sleeved
unshaven sweating and bald ridged with
muscular saliences and ugly as a chinese
demon he had just wakened from a good
kink of sleep and was now indulging in
reflections of great and happy poignancy
  his pale blue eyes surveyed the repeat-
ing rifle in the rack above his bunk and
the two revolvers over the chart table
the chronometer and navigating instru-
ments the shelves containing his nautical
almanacs and tables bowditchs navi-
gator and trashy paper novels that at
odd times beguiled him then they fell
upon the medicine chest affixed to the
bulkhead the chest containing no incon-
siderable supply of his choicest stimu-
lants the sight of that chest caused
him to smile slightly his smile widened
as he gazed upon the old fashioned iron
safe opposite his littered desk medicine
chest and safe-ah fine combination
just now they held much that made life
dear to captain bohannon
  without getting up the captain poured
himself a mans size hooker of whisky
from a bottle on a chair beside his bunk
and drained it he wiped his unshaven
lips with the back of a hirsute hand and
sighed deeply as one temporarily content
with life to have twenty thousand
dollars in ones possession plus always
the possibility of extorting more from a
ship owner in due course of time is not
this enough to cheer even a humor as
the roaring horn

black as on the average was bohannons
  and just what happened to old skin-
flint mellish when he got my letter
murmured bohannon robustiously he
chivvied this idea about hope he had a
fit and fell in it the old pirate when he
found out his precious nephy was aboard
and going to the rocks o the roarin
horn he must have been a subjeck to be
tied-god stiffen him
  most delectably bohannon imagined
jason mellish shaken and sick with
panic cabling to lloyds in buenos
aires instructing them at all hazards
and expense to get roderick tyson off
the china girl before she should clear
from that port or still better the
captain figured to himself that even at
this very moment old jason was aboard
some steamer bound for buenos aires
there to intercept his ship and rescue the
one being whom in all this world he
loved
  that there letter o mine i left with
my friend in brooklyn to be mailed a week
after wed sailed thats aready takin old
jason all ends up mulled bohannon with
keenest pleasure when he found out
hes sendin tyson to die with the rest of
em hell go crazy and roarin by crook
ive paid all my scores aginst tyson and
the old man too and then some eh
what the only thing he loves on
earth-the thing hes doin mebbe twenty-
five murders for-and then the nephy
goin to davy jones with the rest of em
crazy and fit to be tied is what the old
boy  be
  bohannon took another drink and
with vast contentment sucked at his pipe
never in all his life violent and cruel
though it had been had he once con-
summated a plot of vengeance so coldly
malicious so cruelly successful
  let him cable his damn head off
thought bohannon smacking his mental
lips over this vengeance even as he
smacked his physical ones over the whis-
ky let him go to buenos aires and
wait for us longer he waits and more
he cables the better let him stew
much good itll do him by godfrey dia-
monds i wont put in at buenos aires
whatever no sir not that port we
got no wireless he cant get in touch with
us well put in at bahia blanca instead
theres where ill get hurt or somethin
and quit the ship
  so there wont be no news of us at
buenos and hell wait wait wait
hell gnaw his fingers to the old bone
jason will-go crazy die ravin ill
have the laugh on him ill have my
twenty thousand and all scores paid
smart idea eh smart as paint damn
smart if i do say it myself 
into the midst of these enjoyable
reveries leadspitter broke with a
knocking at the captains door
hello whats wanted
  sighted a small boat sir
  have eh pause come in and
lets hear about it
  leadspitter entered red haired and
red necked and generally red with prickly
heat and unpleasant emotions
  i knew you was takin a caulk sir or
id of reported it sooner reckon its
boat off that ship we seen burnin yes-
terday
  do eh where away
  she was off to westard sir dead
ahead now i took it on me-you bein
asleep-to run down to her
  so you took a hell of a lot on you i
must say
  yes sir but you know yourself sir
you cant leave a boat at sea lead-
spitter had become unusually apologetic
if you did an some one was to perish
you know what theyd do to us
  mmmm yes growled the old man
blowing smoke but shiverin top-
masts we dont want no truck with
boats we aint in the life savin busi-
ness not much however i reckon you
done the only thing to do only we got
all the trouble we want as tis without-
but no matter how many men aboard
her
  thats the devil of it sir we aint
sighted no men at all
  what you dont mean to say you

george allan england
altered our course just for an empty
boat
  no sir theres somebody into her
all right but no man as we can see
its-fact is sir its a woman
a which
  a woman sir a female woman
woman you know what i mean sir
a she un
  chewing a curse bohannon swung out
of his berth
  a-woman but hells hinges we
dont want no woman aboard o this one
no more n we want the itch
  not so much sir leadspitter agreed
but there tis sir an cant be no tizzer
an i know lots about itchin too
  ill damn soon see about this the
captain affirmed with a brimstone volley
and up on deck he mounted forthwith to
see about it indeed
the china girl was by this
time within half a mile of the boat
and even to the naked eye the fact
was growing apparent that the boat car-
ried a woman leadspitters binoculars
discovered another form there probably a
man lying inert and motionless in the
stern sheets under the pitiless cooking of
the sun
  the woman sat beside him making
now no signals for rescue was at hand
with keen and growing tensions of inter-
est-for the most part heavy with fore-
bodings of evil fortune that impended-
officers and crew watched while their
ship bore down on the boat bohannons
brow above all was clouded with dis-
pleasure at this embroilment what effect
might it now have upon his plans his
cherished and delightful plans which just
a few minutes before he had been so
savoring on the tongue of anticipation
  but there the boat lay drifting and
whatever impended pick her up the
captain must his face was a chart
of grim ugliness as when the ship
had ranged within a quarter mile he
ordered-
  back the main topsl
  the main yard was thrown aback and
the ship brought close to the wind
slowly losing way she lay in irons com-
pletely stopped
 get the port dingey over com-
manded bohannon
  the watch jumped to the boat-little
urging they needed now-cast the lash-
ings adrift hove up the davit falls and
swung the boat out when the dingey
was lowered leadspitter took a crew of
four of his best seamen carefully over-
looking tyson and gave way handsomely
like something of a nabob the mate sat
in the stern sheets almost an atmosphere
of heroism enveloped him of rescue for
the distressed knight errantry for the
afflicted leadspitter looked quite puffed
up and proud in his role as the dingey
foamed buoyantly over the chrome
green swells splashed with gorgeous sun-
light
  in a few minutes he was alongside the
drifting boat had made her painter fast
and was returning with her in tow the
very copper of excitement lay on the
tongues of the watchers aboard as lead-
spitter drew up amidships on the star-
board side where the jacobs ladder had
been put down a strikingly different
type of boat the castaway was from a
mere ships dingey handsomely metaled
and varnished and built of fine hard-
woods she showed the emblem of a
yacht club on her bow a small pennant
with the initial v also depended from
a staff
  bloomin yachts boat commented
the cockney millionaire stuff an
that perish my pinkies if it eynt
cheeif dems millionaires into it the
gunman judged deyre damn hard
lookin millionaires de skoit-shes all
in down an out an de old feller if he
aint kicked off hes jeezly near it
poor gal the cook murmured
pretty nigh wopped out a wonnerful
perishin sheve had
  what you spose they got in that there
suitcase asked antoon the taxi driver
bunch o kale eh
 stow it growled tyson you
damned jackal
the roaring horn

silence fell save for the orders
necessary to get the castaways
aboard and the boats hoisted
those at the rail could see that the
rescued man although still breathing
was frightfully burned heavily ban-
daged though he was the terrible severity
of his injuries was apparent strips that
seemed to have been torn from a white
duck skirt swathed his head and arms
a grizzle of grayish beard that jutted
from the head bandages proved him an
oldish man and the quality of his charred
suit of blue showed he was no ordinary
sailor inert this man lay in the bottom
of the boat
  wid just about enough life left in un
to breathe on as solomon moon said
proper bet out an burned black as a
tawny he is so
  the aspect of the woman-the girl
rather-now also lying insensible on the
bottom cleats near the man confirmed
the opinion that these were people of
wealth more clearly than any one else
tyson leaning over the rail abreast of
the main hatch perceived that here was
a woman of no common clay often
enough when captain of his own ship
tyson had come in contact with such
people a personable and seemly young
woman this was despite the terror and
hardships she had suffered tysons iner-
rant divinatory glance told him here was
one of the daughters of the house of have
  he noted her blue serge skirt and her
middy blouse of fine white linen now
sadly smudged with dirt and ashes and
salt water observed a ring wherein a
magnificent pigeons blood ruby glowed
in the sunlight but more especially he
saw the opulent mass of lustrous and
blue black hair that all loosened and
disheveled spread thickly on the bottom
cleats of the boat as for the girls face
that remained invisible lying as she
was it was turned from him hidden
against the bandaged right arm of the
unconscious grizzle bearded man
  tyson had however scant time for
observation work was to be done and
at once
 k alive there commanded
 leadspitter rig a whip and
 bring em up
  karlstad attached a small block to the
topmast backstay and through it rove a
line a bowline was lowered into the
yachts boat and the inanimate forms
were hoisted on dcck by a dozen willing
hands
 the boats dropped back from amid-
ships to the quarter where the davit falls
of the dingey were hanging loose first
the yachts boat was hooked on and
brought inboard to be placed amidships
on the poop deck then the davit falls
were overhauled to hoist the dingey
the captains interest centered in the
castaways
 bring em to the break o the poop
and lets have a look at em mr fur-
long commanded bohannon from the
starboard ladder
 tyson was not among those who car-
ried the rescued aft since bohannon
had knocked him over the poop rail that
place had been to him repellent only
when standing trick at the wheel or at
other orders had he even approached it
now leaning against the carpenter shop
he watched the scene in contemplative
silence strange scene under the slash-
ing sunshine of those tropic waters
  vile was bohannons humor viler even
than leadspitters as they inspected the
castaways delays and complications
sequent to life saving lay far outside the
captains purview worse a woman
introduced factors of the most vexatious
the berthing and accommodation of a
woman aboard that old windjammer
might mean god alone knew what trouble
worst of all bohannon previsioned that
the presence of a woman might impose
certain restrictions of speech and action
on him and bohannon was no man to
welcome any restraints whatever
 we got to take em in though god
stiffen em he exclaimed after a pre-
liminary view into the cabin with em
  four sailors under supervision of abey
buzzard the wry necked old steward
carried them through the starboard door

george allan england
into the main cabin where they laid the
man on the table the girl on the lounge
at the port side for the moment all
bohannons thought was directed to get-
ting once more under way
  fill your main topsl again mr
furlong he commanded let her fall
off on her course
  yes sir leadspitter answered
but between you an me an the capstan
sir- and he showed his crooked teeth-
were into quite a rookus with these here
passengers damn f we want to pick up
any more boats let em go to hell or
wherever says i
  right agreed the old man what
we dont see we cant be blamed for not
-rescuin but get her on her course
sooner the better now
  under leadspitters orders the china
girl presently took her course again
leadspitter summoned a few hands to
the quarter deck
  come on bear a hand pass a lashin
round this boat he commanded indi-
cating the one just picked up and let
her stay where she is then get forrard
all o you swabs look alive or ill learn
you how
bohannon turning to inspect the
boat saw the suitcase lying in the
stern sheets
  hello what the devils this and
he lifted it out through all the fume of
his displeasure there was that which now
gleamed speculatively in his pale blue
eye that eye diminished to a point of
wonder they got away with some o
their dunnage all right
  that theres a jim-dandy of a piece o
baggage capn judged leadspitter
its the genuine cowhide liable to be
some good stuff inside there one kind
another an look at them letters on it
will you sir gold letters shelp my
cod
  i l r read bohannon mmmm
tony folks eh what more hell
theyll be wantin us to put in some-
wheres and set em ashore
  he pondered a silent moment frag-
mentary thoughts crossed his tortuous
brain might this not after all jump
with his plans his spade ended fingers
scratched his cranium as he tried to stimu-
late thought how colorable an excuse
might this not give him for making port
somewhere-port where he himself could
quit the doomed ship not too bad this
notion and moreover rich folk like
these what might they not pay for such
service far from bad matters might
after all be in excellent train for captain
bohannon
  for all that though the captain still
let his anger burn anger was to bohan-
non a luxury he never missed freely
indulging but abey buzzard inter-
rupted his thoughts by coming on deck
to report
  we got em stowed sir any time
you wants to put em to a survey sir
theyre ready
  here stewart take this bag below
the captain ordered ill go down and
see whats what ill send mr mayes
up to take charge this to leadspitter
then you come below yourself we
got a few matters to decide on now
atters indeed problems of
the most urgent
  the man stretched out on
the cabin table they saw without need of
more than half an eye was already dying
burns such as he had received could end
in only one way
  this old cuss is nigh hand to hove
down on his beam ends leadspitter
commented hes took some jeroosly
awful damage sir as abey loosened
the bandages with sundry jerks and
quavers of his head the steward being a
nervous man the three saw that the
strangers race was run hes all-fired
nigh dead sir thats sure as shootin
look a them arms an that face burned
to a crisp
  yes and his chist too the captain
answered scrutinizing the man under the
gleam through the skylight looks s
if hed been spattered with burnin oil
or somethin like gas mebbe hes
the roaring horn

more n likely breathed fire too i think
its a doubt if hell stand it till night
hardly burned black as zip
  yes sir an old too goin up for
seventy years or the like o that death
struck is what he is i hope to tell you
i	wouldnt give a tinkers dam for his life
well thats one of em well get clear of
anyhow there aint nothin we can do
for him
  nothin is right bohannon agreed
you and the stewart take him in one o
the spare cabins any one  do he
wont be occupyin it long
  when they had carried the dying man
to a berth and left him there-
  now then said bohannon lets
have a look at the gal
  they found her uninjured so far as
burns were concerned shock exhaustion
thirst accounted for her prostration con-
templatively they studied her devoid of
pity but with keen calculation
  shes had one cold smack all right
grunted leadspitter but she aint hurt
none shell soon come to rights on an
even keel whoever she is devil take
me but shes one good looker
  you take a reef or two and bear
away the captain meaningly warned
stow that kind o talk whatever this
here ship is you bet your jib halyards
there wont be no funny business no
monkey business like that mind you
were carryin a good full o trouble
right now without no petticoat mixups
what id like to know is who the hell
she is where from and where bound
likewise if it comes to that how
much its worth to me rescuin her at
sea
  only way to bottom that out i
reckon is to bring her to a little stain
o rum might fix her
  stewart bohannon ordered a
bucket o water and a tot o rum
  yes sir and abey buzzard fetched
both will i fix her up im a married
man sir i knows all about women
  if you do you old gumphead the
captain retorted you know more n any
other man livin but heave ahead with
her youre old enough so its safe
anyhow
they watched while abey buzzard
roughly swabbed her hands and
face with water then forced rum
into her mouth slopping more than
half of it over her full rounded throat
watched while she stirred there on the
lounge groaned opened dark eyes dazed
with pain and wonder
  youre all right miss the captain
rumbled in a tone he meant to be ingra-
tiating soothing youre gettin all
fine and shipshape again youre safe
aboard now-safe
  the girl shuddering tried to struggle
up but bohannon pushed her back again
with his huge and anchor tattooed paw
  no no miss you lay down and keep
quiet he commanded youve had it
tough and rugged been took a bit
abaft and keeled over youre dll spun
out now but youll soon be a-l slicks
a mole lay still now thats the best
you can do
  father she exclaimed in a weak
voice fining down to a whisper wheres
father
  right in that there cabin miss
and he jerked an unseemly thumb at
the cabin door we got your dunnage
all righto he picked up the suitcase
and set it on the table here she is
see your father hes comftable as
could be expected now go to sleep
get a little kink and youll be fine
  i want to see my father
  well you cant see your father-not
just yet the captain asserted with con-
siderable vehemence were lookin out
for your father
  is he-dead
  no he aint there now you lay
quiet
  for a moment with large and fright-
ened eyes she peered up at bohannon
leadspitter and old abey buzzard
dimly she perceived the cradling roll of
the ship heard the creak and give of
timbers that constituted the old vessels
answer to the sea but very clearly she

george allan england
had not fully recovered her understand-
ing life still swam before her mistily
obscured as if dimming veils of haze
at last-
  if you say hes all right- she fal-
tered and they saw her eyes were deeper
blue than any sea so blue so deep they
verged almost on black
  aint i said so aready demanded
the captain think im lyin eh what
im truthful miss  am
  the girl tried to say a few words but
fell away to silence without making herself
intelligible drawing in a deep breath
she sank to oblivions of exhaustion
  leave her be sir beggin your par-
don ventured old abey i knows all
about women shell be fine arfter a bit
o sleep
  look answered bohannon carry
her in that spare cabin next her old man
fix her up comftable mr furlong
you bear a hand too-that is carryin
her in
  mate and steward bore her away limp
helpless the captain remained staring
at the suitcase fascinated by its luxurious
leather the gold stamped initials the
possibilities it might enclose presently
leadspitter emerged from the cabin
whither they had carried the girl bohan-
non silently beckoned him gestured
eloquently at the suitcase leadspitter
nodded
  just then the captain saw abey buz-
zard peering out at him with an odd
wondering look
  will i bring her baggage in to her too
sir the steward asked
  no ive given you your orders you
old mope fix that woman up comftable
in that there cabin and look alive about
it or ill give you a bit o the rough side o
my tongue and remember one thing
stewart
  yes sir
  nothin as happens here goes out o
here savvy no long tongues wanted
aboard o this one im the best tightener
of loose mouths as ever trod a ratline
get me
  yes-yes sir abey vanished
  bohannon picked up the suitcase and
nodded his head toward the door of his
own room leadspitter followed him
thither once inside with the catch on
the door shot home bohannon laid the
suitcase on his desk
  now then mr furlong he bit out
now then lets see whats what
chapter v
 treasure and death
tt thats what echoed lead-
 spitter his thick fingers shook
  	 a little as he filled and lighted
his pipe this thing of investigating rich
folks baggage had somewhat sapped his
nerve it wouldnt be just the proper
ticket to open that there suitcase dyou
think
  why not wouldnt it
  well sir i aint superstitious nor
nothin but you know the old sayin
as how a suitcase aboard ship alius brings
bad luck best thing we-you-could
do seems like would be to leave it lay
well i aint goin to nohow bohan-
non decided and whats more im
askin you to heave up longside and bear
a hand with me doin it i want you to
see alls done reglar and shipshape-no
shenanigans
  leadspitter thought
  devil of a lot you care about reglar
and shipshape youre only askin me to
help because id know you done it any-
how and you want to work me in on it to
share up the trouble if it comes to that
all he voiced though was
  youre capn here heave ahead sir
if you think fit
  course i think fit bohannon re-
turned his eyes narrowing why
wouldnt i aint i got the legal right to
know whats bein brought aboard my
ship supposin there was smuggled
stuff into it or arms and ammynition
might be a pistol eh what
  yes thats so the mate assented
i never thought o that an besides-
well what
the roaring horn	

  oh nothin heave ahead sir lets
put it to a survey
  bohannon unstrapped the suitcase
which here or there showed charred spots
he opened the lock raised the cover
  mmph he grunted only a female
fit out i reckon not much here and
what there is its all like an old fireships
garret everythin on top and nothin
handy
  his huge and tattooed hand pawed at
feminine small wares and apparel he
was about to close the suitcase again
when his fingers touched metal his
half embarrassed ineptitude vanished
  hello whats this now he ex-
claimed with an oath a gun
 it was not however a gun as
bohannon dragged out the metal object
it stood revealed as a japanned dispatch
box with j d l painted on its lid
  what the devils this the captain
repeated
  its a tin box sir
  oh it is eh thanks for tellin me
bohannon gibed his scarred lip asnarl
youre a man of grand observation
mr furlong i aint blind a box yes
but whats into it that ah thats the
question now
  setting the box on his desk he turned a
key still in its lock
  by judas priest sir leadspitter
protested thats mebbe sailin a bit too
free openin that there
  who knows but what the pistols in
here demanded the captain i got
the legal right to know its my duty by
jolly to know and im goin to
  whereupon without further ado he
opened the metal box
for a moment they remained there
meshed in silence a silence into
which intruded only the creak of
masts and yards the whispering of cloven
waters along the hull the various voices
of a ship at sea but all at once-
thunderin god the captain gulped
leadspitter reached out uncertainly
touched the contents of the box drew
back again the mates eyes were wide
his jaw hanging the pipe fell spark
throwing and unheeded to the floor
  by the jumpin jehosophat he
stammered
  bohannon fell to pawing over the cash
under his rough and trembling fingers
the sheaves of yellow backs crumpled the
bonds wrinkled a lust of greed burned
in his eyes which had become those of a
wolf eagerly he licked his lips
  hells bells furlong-what a find
its all o that by the judas looks
like a little million but but what dyou
mean sir a find
  a find is a find aint it you lump-
head moneys money
  yes but thats cordin to whose it is
and this here-it aint ourn
  no not now but it might be eh
what
  might be sir i-i dont quite
fathom it out where you drivin
silence again while eye met eye lips
tightened the captains scar had grown
livid he swallowed mechanically
  are you a mouse or a man he shot
at leadspitter
  youd oughta know whats on your
chist heave it off
  pull up your braces and square your-
self fore an aft mr furlong take your
bearins lets see how much guts you
got
  well sir
  who does all this here stuff belong to
them two an when the old un
slips his wind its the gals i-i aint
quite got the lay of it yet sir
  you aint got the wit of a louse
bohannan growled just supposin that
there gal-somethin was to happen
her-
  ah meanin-
  you damn muttonhead supposin-
and bohannons voice lowered to hardly
more than a thread of sound-supposin
some dark night she was to get lost over-
board or the like o that
  by god
  we could take care o that part of it
slick as pins but thered have to be
two of us savvy one reports it tother
	george allan england
      
calls the mainmst to witness its true
swears to it on a stack o bibles-swears
till alls blue
  shhh ease off capn not so loud
leadspitter hauled up a camp stool
and sat down cheek by jowl with captain
bohannon
  this here now is what i calls gram-
matical youre a cool star all righto
but im just as cool without no frills
to it you mean were to whack up this
here stuff
  you aint so damn tender that you
dont get my drift you wont tear under
the wing
  we goin to let pete mayes in on
this
  bohannon shouted an angry answer
hells bells no what djou think
i am a complete fool
  mechanically leadspitter drummed on
the desk top
  no i never thought that o you any-
how so then its just you an me
  the first wine of excitement was dying
in their veins now their pulses were
beginning to beat with a more calculant
tempo
  lost overboard the captain re-
peated thats what i said act o
god stress o weather or whatever and
nobody but us two knows what in this
here box do they
 no how much dyou make it
capn
  bohannon dumped the contents of the
dispatch box on to his desk and spread it
abroad a little chamois bag caught his
eye this bag had lain beneath the
paper money and the bonds and thus had
till now escaped him with thick fingers
that quivered a bit he picked it up lead-
spitter eagerly exclaimed-
  cast off them cords there sir an
lets see
  with some difficulty bohannon loos-
ened the chamois bag from it he poured
out a cascade of diamonds small and
large of emeralds rubies sapphires
even in the half light of the cabin the
precious stones winked and shimmered
fascinating pools of liquid light
oly murder in ireland the
captain gasped
  leadspitter made odd grunt-
ing noises half breathless and blown by
winds of covetousness he managed to
articulate-
 how-how much-
  lashins o money bohannon ex-
claimed i aint strong on estimatin
joolry or the like o that but i know
theres many a kings ransom e for less n
just these here as for the bonds and
cash-
  devil take the bonds we dont want
no truck nor dealin with bonds capn
aint people always gettin ketched up
that way an hove on a lee shore mon-
keyin with bonds burn em up sir
heave em to hells alley an gone thats
my say but the cash money there the
rhino-how much count it capn
count it
  bohannons clumsy fingers shook as he
stacked up the heavy bundles of bank-
notes-some of them the big white ones
of the bank of england-and began
counting wolfish eyed leadspitter
watched with suspended breath
  hundred and five thousand amer-
ican the captain announced sixteen
thousand pounds english thats lets
see call it eighty thousand bucks hun-
dred and eighty-five thousand without
them jools
  he fell silent his eyes like live coals
for a moment leadspitter could find no
words only the rumor of their heavy
breathing and the send of the waves
against the hull disturbed that pregnant
silence
  hundred an-eighty-five thousand
gulped leadspitter sweating and with
red hair rucked up he made a singular
figure of agitation thats-by judas
priest-thats more n ninety thousand
apiece for us an-
  slack away aft the captain growled
who said anything about even-steven
aint you goin to
  like hell here here dont you try
to get to windard o me mr furlong
youre on the wrong tack entire one
the roaring horn

third is what you get and thats a damn
sight more n you deserve too me thinkin
up the whole scheme and all one third
all snug and tidy take it or leave it
well what say 
  a moment it seemed that leadspitter
was minded to contest but the cap-
tains brow was heavy with menace he
threatened
  youre liable not to get a cent if you
dont speak up lively
  all right sir the mate conceded
have it your own way one third
thats sixty for my cut anyhow an
them there stones
  same share but-
a timid knocking at the door
checked him
	who the devils that
  me sir sounded abey buzzards
voice i just wanted to say sir the old
man-its all off with him
  kicked the bucket you mean
  yes sir thought youd oughta
know
  all right sheer off to leadspitter
he muttered i hope by jolly that old
fool of a stewart aint noticed we got the
suitcase in here
  he dont notice nothin the mate
hardly more than whispered he dont
notice not even the sun dont know hes
alive i aint worryin none about abey
already bohannon was tying up the
gems in the buckskin bag replacing bag
money bonds much as they had been in
the metal box he closed the box and
locked it then shoved it back into the
suitcase which he tightly strapped a
moment he pondered with another and a
new idea pulling him by the ear lead-
spitter watched him keenly he smeared
sweat from his forehead heavily beaded
and huskily breathed-
  man aloft but its hot here
harkee mr furlong the captain
suddenly spoke you and me were
pardners into this here now one third
for you and two for me thats a say so
both of us and stands but im thinkin
this here may not be such a picnic at that
its all up to you to keep a stopper on
your jaw if this here if any breath o
this money now was to get forrard-
among them beggars forrard
thats it if they was to suspi-
cion it-
  you mean they might start a manus
mutinize on us
  youre a good guesser we might
have a racket with em all right that
gang o hell benders theyd tear the
hearts out of us through our teeth to
get the stuff yes and the livers too
and you can lay to that solid
  a lot they could do truculently re-
turned the mate
  you cant never tell what they might
do so you just be careful and double-
reef your tongue savvy its a fact we
got all the guns bohannon glanced at
the ships armament suspended above
but our aft guard is only me and you
peter mayes and old abey course we
could count on bosun saltash and a few o
the stiddiest men but forrard theres
fifteen or more as hard cases as ever i see
in one bunch whats more theres one
of em-
  you mean that black livered cod
tyson
  right hes got brains that lad has
most of em dont know enough to lap
salt bohannon judged but if they
was torched up and led by tyson-
and youve got to log him as a smart un
hed be in our wake sure as shootin
hes got guts too hed tackle hell with
half a pint o water aint much like his
uncle damned old yeller spined coward
and-
  so you admit as how old jason mel-
lish is his uncle for a fact
  whats the use denyin it to you
no odds anyhow all as matters is
tyson with a scrapper like that-
nothin to hinder tyson takin a
high dive too some night is there
not the captain replied not if we
was put to it proper but there aint no
use takin long shots the winds hangin
from a good quarter for us lets keep
it so there aint no use takin chances
s
george allan england
eloquently he touched his thin and gash-
like mouth so-you know
  im wise capn but what you goin
to do with the stuff for now
  do goin to give it back to the gal
o course arfter that well if i spilled
all the wind out o my sails youd know
as much as what i do
  an thats just what i got to know
the mate declared with choleric insistence

were pardners that means we got to
work together
  yes just as far as im willin and no
farther stow that stuff mr furlong
im runnin this here business but
youll get your whack dont you worry

your superior officer hells bells but
thats nigh hand to mutiny bohannons
pale eyes bored through the mate gimlet-
like leadspitters own fell now then
mums the word and here goes to put
the stuff back all proper and honest-
like
while leadspitter keenly watched
him he got up and unlocked the
door taking the suitcase he
swung across the slant of the main cabin
floor to the girls cabin knocked got no
answer and entered he set the case
down beside the berth where she was
lying then for a moment he stood watch-
ing her with evil and prehensive cal-
culation
  all at once the girls dark eyes opened
and bohannon found himself enveloped in
a gaze whose steady scrutiny for all his
bravado just a little abashed him
  my father the girl asked weakly
is he better
  miss replied the captain with rather
a failure of trying to render his tone sym-
pathetic miss i wish you was a little
stronger the news i got for you-
  her look widened she struggled up
and sat there trembling in the berth
you mean-
 bohannon boggled the divulgation
clumsily as an elephant trying to play a
harp
  i mean-dont take it too hard miss
he mustered enough hypocrisy to condole
i mean as how theres things happen
to all of us now and again
  you mean hes dead
  well his moorins has slipped for a
fact in a manner of speakin his anchor
chain has parted i got to admit
  if hes dead tell me
  aint that just what im doin miss
when i tell you hes topped his boom as
you might say-parted his gear-
  where is he she cried and got to
her feet holding unsteadily to the side of
the berth where is he
  next cabin miss but you hadnt
oughta-
  let me go to him let me go
  oh all right then as she tried to
reach the door he caught her arm half
supported her but dont take it too
hard not too doggoned hard miss
he led her to the cabin where the dead
man lay and opened the door for her
  dont come in please she whispered
brokenly i just want to be alone with
him for the last time-alone 
half an hour on-a half hour
during which bohannon had sat
herding his thoughts about rob-
bery leadspitter bahia blanca and the
roaring horn-the captain spatted out
the last of several pipefuls and betook
himself to the cabin of death he knocked
and entered
  he stood a moment in the doorway
covertly smiling his heart granitic with
exultation that things were so aptly fall-
ing to his hand but-
the roaring horn

  come come he made a shift of
saying in a voice that tried to soothe
he laid an ape paw on her shoulder as
the girl knelt beside the bunk where lay
the dead man come now miss this
here dont do no good grievin dont
we all has to go by the board all come
to anchor forever one time another
takin on that dont help none whats
done is done aint it well then buck
up thats what i say miss-buck up
she looked at him a silent moment
with a courage that nobly partnered her
grief then she reached for his hand
pressed it bohannon dribbled out a few
more words of cant
  i know its tough miss its all fired
awful tough but-
  youre good to me she whispered
forgive me if im weak her lip
trembled i-oughtnt to be weak im
a sea captains daughter myself so i

  eh what he had a ship what

  sure it wouldnt do yknow keepin

forrard theyre that superstitious
trouble enough as it is without addin
none to it and besides he added with
  fine tact this hot weather-and no
ice-

away
  yes miss right off the bat as you
might say
  she sighed heartbrokenly
  just go out a minute captain
please just till i say goodby to him
then it-itll be all right
  he left her alone closed the door and
stood waiting his eye gleamed with
mercenary calculation
  a game un he pondered sea
capns daughter too hmmm thats
bad no easy mark this here female
aint he scratched his baldish head
with some displeasure but arfter all
that dont make a damns odds shes
only a gal and theres ways ways
presently she came out of the cabin
stood a moment with her hand lingering
against the door then walked to her own
room even in those few steps as
bohannon watched her slim grace he
knew she had spoken truth no woman
walks like that who has not long been
familiar with the sea
when she had vanished into her
cabin bohannon went to his own
for a welt of rum and-thus
fortified-sought leadspitter in the mates
room he found leadspitter barefoot
and in only undershirt and trousers the
mate stretched out in his bunk was
brooding in a smoky atmosphere
  time to give the old son of a one a
sea toss began the captain quicker
the better they dont keep long this
hot weather they get high mighty all
fired quick
  o k sir ill have the stiff sewed
up right away leadspitter grinned
with yellow teeth thats one of em
anyhow got rid of and expectantly
leadspitter sat up

kind o deep water man himself a skip

  bohannon withdrew to the dead mans
cabin while leadspitter grumbling sum-
moned boatswain saltash
  bosun he ordered get some old
togaln cloth in the sail locker an sew up
the stiff be sure you ballast him good
  too quick as youre ready well heave
him
  yes sir answered the old p i and
twisted his stringy gray mustache
couple o prayer books  do sir
  put in a bible too for full measure
i reckon he was a pretty good man an
it takes a lot to keep a good man down
on which jest both grinning they
terminated the interview leadspitter
continued smoking the boatswain de-
parted to busy himself with preparations
for the burial at sea
  bohannon meantime was searching the
body his eye was the eye of a crocodile
his smile that of a hyena into his pocket
he slipped some thirty dollars in bills
and silver of which he relieved the
corpse
  here by god he muttered is a
little jack i dont have to share up with
leadspitter and whats the devilish
use of lettin this old stiff keep it lot o
good itd do him where hes goin
 the dead mans watch and a few
papers he laid aside to give the girl
then matters seeming in good train he
went back to his own cabin once more for
another drink or two
  the china girl meantime with a fair
and following breeze was logging off the
knots shortening the long sea miles that
lay between her and the horn

    a gold strike is likely to change a
    mans viewpoint on many things
especially
   dance hall
           women
 by alma and paul ellerbe
c jim briggs wandered into
als dance hall one night when
captain mac was drunk and
throwing things
  she had splendid deep red hair and a
skin as white as blanched almonds and
he admired her extravagantly as a
child admires a christmas tree and dif-
ferently too-very differently he had
even given up prospecting now and then
and made good money as a carpenter so
that he could spend it on her he had
spent it all and he knew her very well
but he had never seen her drunk before
he had been in such places a good deal
but he hadnt got used to seeing women
drunk it hurt him
  he was about to wander on out again
when he heard one of the other girls say
shes gonna pay for this all right a
will make er come acrost with the ex-
penses of the whole damn place for a
month for that big mirror she broke
long jim hesitated and then started
toward her she took a saucer from one
of t he little tables and sailed it like a clay
pigeon it curved and hit him over the
eye the blood ran down his cheek and
everybody laughed he wiped it away
with his handkerchief and put his hand


alma and paul ellerbe
on her arm just as she was going to throw
another saucer
  why rosie- he said reproachfully
in his soft rumbling bass and stopped
helplessly his soft black eyes looked out
kindly above his soft brown mustache and
his great soft brown beard and said what
his tongue couldnt find the words for
  captain mac was madder than she
was drunk all her sensations and her
thoughts were combined in one ache like
the ache in a tooth and she was biting
upon it savagely and taking a kind of sat-
isfaction in the keen shoots of her pain
she could have knifed a that night out
of hand and seen through stoically what-
ever might have come of it but jim
briggs voice and his eyes were the kind
of things she had forgotten the existence
of and they slipped in under her guard
and pierced the quick of her
  she didnt throw the other saucer but
suddenly rosie ellen mccarthy a decent
irish girl looked out of her eyes and said
with a flash of passionate appeal-
  for gods sake jim take me out o
this
  jim didnt expect it it touched him
so deeply that he could only gulp and nod
his head with his great height and bent
shoulders and baggy clothes he looked
uncouth and awkward standing beside
painted half nude captain mac in her
spangled dress he looked around help-
lessly for something to cover her shoul-
ders with
   thisll do she said stretching out her
hand for a yellow scarf on the top of a
gilded upright piano
  she took it with one strong pull sling-
ing heedlessly along the floor in a rain of
broken bits half a dozen pieces of bric-a-
brac that had rested upon it
  jim folded the gaudy stuff clumsily
about her and took her by the arm and
started to go out when a came up and
stood in front of him dapper suave and
touched with cynicism
  theres money owing me he said po-
litely and she aint going nowhere till
its paid see
  the red surged into jims cheeks pale
from working underground and his voice
rose dangerously out of its soft rumble
  theres a hell of a lot more than
money owing you you god-forgotten lit-
tle skunk and if you dont get out o my
way im liable to pay you the part of it
you aint lookin for
  he kept his eye on the others hands
and his muscles braced if you started
things in als place you finished them
swiftly or they finished you
  the white hairy fingers twitched into
the expected signal and jim swung the
bony mass of his fist against als ear as he
would have swung a pick into a stubborn
conglomeration of quartz but that was
incidental he didnt even notice where
the little man rolled jerked forward
by als signal a very different antago-
nist was coming on the jump-hard pan
schmitz the dance hall bouncer
  jim briggs was no match for him and
knew it almost as if he had followed
through the blow that sent a spinning
he snatched up a heavy lighted lamp
whirled it above his head and flung it it
struck schmitzs raised forearm smashed
down his guard and covered him with
broken glass and burning oil
  in the stunned second before the racket
began jim took rosie by the wrist and
broke through to the street behind
them the place seethed like an ants nest
laid open by a spade
  he pulled her around the first corner
they pelted through the snow as fast as
she could run he zigzagged his way
through the town taking alleys when he
could they came at length to the door
of a wooden shack below the level of the
sidewalk on an unlighted street its
unpainted boards were warped it listed
heavily and in common with all the other
houses in the block it looked deserted
but jim jumped down to it key in hand
and by the time rosie had descended the
rickety steps that led from the sidewalk
he had opened the door
  he shut it behind her struck a match
and led the way into a room furnished
with a stove a camp cot a chair and a
small pine table with a smoke blackened
especially dance hall women

lamp on it he lighted the lamp rosie
fell into the chair breathing in big pain-
ful gulps she wasnt used to running
the great altitude-ten thousand feet-
had played havoc with her breath jim
had swung a pick there too long to be
much affected they looked at each other
in the dim light
  its jest a place to sleep he said
awkwardly nobody knows i own it
feller gave it to me that struck it rich an
went away mostly im in the hills any-
how so wouldnt anybody look for us
here
  and then
  the sheriff and the marshals both
down on al if we can get away without
bein noticed it aint likely anybodyll
foller
  maybe itd be safe for you to stay
then said rosie when she had breath
enough to say anything
  maybe but i was aimin to go any-
how why dont you go with me an-
an stay with me
  she looked at him steadily
   i aint fit
  youre as fit as i am he said quietly
in the soft rumbling reassuring bass that
seemed kin to rivers and winds what
dyou say to a clean break an a new start
together he lingered on the last word
wistfully ive been pretty lonesome
you know a-knockin round from one
prospect hole to another an livin like a
pack rat
  she got up and came close and looked
at him intently the yellow piano scarf
that covered her befrizzled red head like
an incongruous cowl and clashed crudely
with her red dress her silver slippers
her spangles the bunch of cotton roses at
her waist her rouged cheeks and scarlet
lips and half-bared heaving breasts con-
trasted strangely with her honest eyes
do you want it for yourself jim
for myself-moren anything
youre not lying to me
  so help me god
  he had expected her arms about his
neck but she gave him her hand like a
man
  ill never let you down she said
shortly lets go
  they went out under a sky of faint
clean blue where a frosty moon queened
it amidst a scattering of small pale stars
and found a man who was driving out of
town in a wagon and went with him
  by one means and another they made
their way into the gray dome country
and jim built a cabin there
fifteen years later rosie briggs
stood in the door of it and watched
jim climb down the steep trail to-
ward his latest prospect hole
  there was a fresh sprinkling of snow
so light and dry that the faint wind
started bits of it to rolling like feathers
beneath it the smells of spruce and pine
and juniper and little silver mountain
sage were dormant the cold clean thin
air of early morning was stripped for the
odor of long jims pipe and it drifted up
rank and acrid rosie liked it at that
hour and in that place
  she watched him until he waved his
hand far below like a tiny marionette be-
fore he took the fork of the trail under the
big engelmann spruce and disappeared
for the day she waved back and turned
to her tubs every week she washed the
clothes of four families in gray dome the
mining town down the main road just
around the next bend it was hard work
but she didnt mind it much
  she didnt think about it besides she
only worked four days a week the
other three she rested-sewed a little
crocheted a little knit a little-sweaters
and stockings and mittens for jim and
herself and kept her diminutive house as
clean as a chemists scales or sat quietly
out in front in summer or inside by the
stove in winter and let the long waves of
peace wash deeper and deeper in peace
is good after a life like rosies she lay
in it thankfully as in a bath and soaked
old stains away
  on the side of gray dome mountain
with the sheer drop of the canon at her
feet and the range spread out beyond
in the midst of cleanness and silence

alma and paul ellerbe
unbroken since that old rocky backbone of
the continent thrust itself up into the sun
she had risen slowly out of the shards of
the life of captain mac and come late
but surely into her heritage of womanli-
ness and dignity the years had chipped
away her prettiness but in its place was
beauty for those who could see it the
smooth face had been sculptured into
something fine and strong and self-di-
rected something steadfast and serene
she wasnt blown about by tantrums any
more
  she had a stake in the game of life now
and she played to hold it she had stead-
ied to meet the responsibilities thrust
upon her by jim he was as kind and
patient as the seasons and as unreliable
and she was like a cottonwood tree she
put out the leaves of her affection and
confidence surely and abundantly but
with tireless caution and she rarely got
nipped she controlled him where he
could be controlled and where he couldnt
she accepted him as she did the weather
her knowledge of men was empirical un-
hampered by theories
  jim would give anybody anything she
had-he possessed nothing himself-and
be perennially surprized if she objected
usually she didpt but if it was some-
thing she wanted she went after it and
got it back if she could any bum or
crook or sharper could win his friendship
and pick his mind or his pocket if either
happened to have anything in it
  but rosies mind was her own and in-
stead of a pocket she used the conifer
county savings bank she met him at
all points as shrewdly as if he had been
an opponent-which in a sense he was-
but she loved him and she knew that
he loved her and counted on it but only
for what it was worth
  she put more trust in his poverty
every day of course he expected to strike
it and for a while she had thought he
might but gradually as the days lay
themselves down in long pleasantly mo-
notonous rows until the sum of them
made many years she came to know that
he wouldnt and that far more than his
love was the foundation of her content
while he was poor he was hers-wholly
unqualifiedly unthinkingly hers
  poor was scarcely the word though
jim lived in a moneyless world out of
the little she made she supplied the sim-
ple necessities of both of them and he was
willing to wait for everything else until
he struck it then- then- was
what he thought of as he made his slow
way up and down the mountainside to
him the thought was roseate luminous
rejuvenescent
  but rosie hated it if for nothing
else because it held the seeds of possible
change after a chancy life she valued
most of things attainable by human be-
ings a life that was free from chances
  on this morning in spring an eagle
slanted down the sky on wide still wings
the ice broke up and tinkled in little cub
creek in the canon the orange and yel-
low shoots of the willows swelled out to-
ward catkins and rosie washed her
clothes contentedly secure in the knowl-
edge that there was no then while over
in his hole in the side of old baldy jim
broke up her world with quick excited
blows of a short-handled miners pick
  she was hanging out the clothes on the
squawberry bushes at the back when she
heard the impatient crash of his elk hide
boots she went quickly through the
house and stopped in the front door at
sight of him
  when he swung up his heavy bag of
samples for a signal she knew knew
before she heard his whoop and when
it cut across the stillness like the whistle
of a locomotive it struck her cold it
chilled the core of her spirit as an icy
wind loosed in the tropics would chill a
naked native
  struck it by thunder two hundred
dollars to the ton if its worth a cent
an the vein as plain as a layer o choc-
late in a cake
  he fell into a chair on the porch rosie
stood and stared at him the one thing
he knew was ore he had the kind of
knowledge that men had been willing to
pay for when hed sell it his then had
especially dance hall women

come the realization went through her
consciousness in widening rings what-
ever else it meant it meant the end of
this the beginning of uncertainty
  he caught her in his arms and swept
her into the cabin and danced her about
until the place shook
  didnt i tell you didnt i say youd
ride in your own auto yet it had to
come old lady it jest nacherally had to
come
  he gave her a hug and turned her
loose
  i knowed it he said solemnly ive
alius knowed it away down deep in
there- he tapped his breast-ive had
a hunch
  he flung himself into a chair and looked
at her hard aint you glad he said
suddenly
  she was like a boat that has luffed into
the wind for a moment her mental sails
hung flapping then they filled and
strained and she set out before this new
cold breeze she told him as best she
could that she was glad
  to look at you a feller might think
you was kinder sorry like he said quiz-
zically whats the matter
  i was thinkin a little about how happy
wed been right here-just you and me
and the house you made yourself
   twarnt a patch on what its gonna
be he said and jumped up and was off
with his samples to the assayers in gray
dome he stepped strongly as a young
man does half the stoop was gone from
his shoulders
  rosie turned back slowly and sat down
heavily at the kitchen table her occupa-
tion gone jim didnt need a grubstaker
now she sat there a long time while
memories of other miners who had got
rich swarmed in her brain like little devils
that fell over each other in their eagerness
to stab her senator sherrill and tom
potts the hotel man and hooker bates
who took his flier in wall street and
mike watson who divorced his wife for
dora schoonmaker and a dozen others
they made their money and then were
gathered in by women like the schoon-
makers she had seen so many of them
they always left the women they had
picked up when they were poor espe-
cially dance hall women even when
they were their wives
 and she and jim had never been
married
but rosie briggs wasnt a quit-
ter little in her life had gone by
default when the terms of the
sale of the mine had been arranged and
everybody in conifer county knew that
jim was going to be a rich man she
capped his plans with hers and squared
about to meet what was coming she
went over her clothes and spruced up as
much as she could to match her new
station and very carefully she laid
down a program of buying to be carried
out as soon as the money came in
  among her things she found a picture
that she had clipped from a fashion mag-
azine twelve years ago-a colored picture
of an electric-blue plush dress of a style
that she had admired she felt a twinge
of sadness as she wondered how many
other things that she had wanted and
gone without would look as queer as
that now
  the dress she had worn when jim took
her out of the dance hall-the red dress
with the spangles on it-looked queerer
but that night while jim was in the vil-
lage on an errand after supper she put it
on and sat waiting for him by the fire de-
termined to play such cards as she
had
  when he came in he stopped at the door
of the little sitting room with a whistle
of surprize
  i aint seen that for ten years didnt
know you had it
  it isnt much- she said smoothing
the skirt
  she had lengthened and renovated it
as best she could it was the only piece
of finery she owned
  its all right lord how purty i uster
think it was
  the windows were open to the night
the weather had turned suddenly warm

alma and paul ellerbe
that day as if the old earth had decided to
start life all over again with the briggses
there was a moon and the new tender
leaves of the aspens about the cabin
made patterns on it that twinkled you
could almost feel the soft wooly anemones
thrusting up their oval spear points out-
side
  the feel of it all had got into rosies
heart and driven out some of her fears
she even had her old banjo in her lap
she wanted to prove to him that she
meant to help him to be happy she
touched the strings and began to sing
  she knew only the songs that had been
popular a good while ago-daisy
two little girls in blue sweet rosie
ogrady and one or two more of the
same sort these to her were music-
all there was of it she sang
   daisy daisygive me your answer true
   im half crazy just for the love of you   
and felt a load slipping from her heart as
the snow slips from the summit of gray
dome mountain when warm weather
comes
  gosh jim murmured you aint
sung that sence-
  he let the sentence die his eyes
smiled above his grizzling brown mus-
tache and beard she wanted to put
down the banjo and go to him and touch
his hand but she went on singing
pleased that she remembered the tune so
well that her voice rang out so clear and
true and jim came and sat close beside
her
  a strange deliciously sweet odor crept
in under the smells of growing things and
wet earth out there on the dripping moun-
tainside she felt just then that jim was
as steadfast and as sure to stand by as the
huge silver spruce that the cabin was
built against she let her cheek rest on
the shoulder of his coat -
          it wont be a stylish marriage
         for i cant afford a carriage 
the odor came more strongly it was like
orange flowers she smiled at the senti-
mental notion orange flowers on the
side of gray dome-
      but youd look sweet-upon the seat
      of a bicycle built-
  the odor came from jims coat
  it said suddenly lorraine schoon-
maker as plainly as jims lips could
have said it to smell it was to see the
girl standing behind the counter in the
gray dome dry goods companys store
probably there was no one in town who
would have failed to connect her with
that perfume
  a knife seemed to unfold inside of
rosie it cut her song off in the middle
of the line and brought her upright in her
chair with a gasp
  whats the matter jim said startled
  she got to her feet she almost came
straight out with it that would have
been like her it was what she wanted
to do but for the first time in many
years she was afraid she stared at jim
with deep revulsion suddenly he was
part of an elemental horror that she had
climbed out of long ago and that now was
closing around her again
  i-i hadnt ought tove sung that
she said thickly it-makes me think
too much of the old days and went
stumbling off to the bedroom
  he followed her and stood around say-
ing things to comfort her and finally she
pretended that her mood had passed
but when she lay still at last by his side
and thought about lorraine schoonma-
ker hard lines pulled at the corners of her
mouth that hadnt been there for fifteen
years long after all traces of it had van-
ished she fancied that the air was faintly
touched with the perfume of orange
flowers
  women would have been bad enough
but he would have tired of them and come
back thered be no coming back from
this girl of twenty-one clever and hard
of mind and soft and pink of body with
the first taste of what money could do
fresh in her mouth
 men didnt come back from the
schoonmaker women behind lorraine
especially dance hall women

with her sleek black pomaded hair her
short tight pussy willow taffeta one piece
gown her chiffon stockings and high-
heeled satin pumps with rhinestone
buckles her vanity case almost as big as
a traveling bag her jeweled wrist watch
and swinging bead girdle rosie saw ally
schoonmaker her older sister who had
married timothy bund practically on his
death-bed for his house and his shares in
the north star mine and behind ally
up the ladder of the years a rung or
two dora schoonmaker breaking up the
watson home when mike watsons mine
began to pay and somehow juggling him
into a divorce from the woman who had
seen him through the lean grim years of
penury and into marriage with her and
then carrying him off east and effie
the oldest of the four who had run away
with perce williams nearly two decades
her junior when he came into his fathers
money and held him grimly to her side
ever since
  yes and even bertha schoonmaker
the mother with her wig and her dirty
chiffon blouses and her painted cheeks
and brown teeth and pink-lined hats with
floating pink veils playing the man-game
still at sixty-four their lean rapacious
schoonmaker hands were all alike if
lorraine took jim shed take him to
keep at the altar for very definite
financial ends of her own
  the tacit bargain between long jim
and rosie had never got itself into words
they hadnt felt the need of them he
had pulled her out of hell the strength
of her allegiance to him couldnt be in-
creased by the mere saying of words how-
ever sacred or the giving of a ring mar-
riage would have added nothing to her
side of it nor she had thought to his
she wished now that she had it but it
had not occurred to her to wish it before
she had had something so much solider
in poverty marriage might hold and it
might not but while he had been depen-
dent upon her for his food and clothes
there had been no doubt
  she went back to that over and over
that night seeing the placid years in the
little house as very beautiful through a
mist of pain she had a feeling that pull-
ing at the almost forgotten cadences of
the song she had brought the past down
about her ears she felt the old trapped
fatalistic despair and sick rage without
the old vigor something began banking
up inside of her steadily relentlessly
she was terribly afraid of it it seemed
to her that it was a great bubble of black
blood in her brain and that when it
burst- she tried to keep from thinking
to ease the strain on it but her thoughts
streamed out swiftly from oubliettes in
obscure corners of her mind
  they were hideous thoughts and really
not hers at all it seemed that some devil
sent them to torture her the unfair-
ness of it gagged in her throat she had
fought her way out of filth and blackness
to cleanness and the sun and now with-
out volition the old horror came on her
again from within-clicked through her
brain like yards and yards of cinema film
the current of her life had swept past its
one clean tranquil place and was swirling
along muddied and normal the familiar
ache was in her heart and rosie was her-
self again-captain mac of als dance
hall you didnt get away from things
like that
  well there were things that captain
mac knew how to do that rosie briggs
had forgotten she had whipped a can
along the street once with revolver bul-
lets as a child whips a hoop to the ad-
miration of every idle man in town and
ended the demonstration by shooting a
strangers plug hat off his head with-
out disturbing his hair her whirling
thoughts showed her jims old  in the
left-hand end of the bottom drawer of
the dresser
  she must wait she told herself-and
her heart gave a great bound-she must
wait until she had them together she
laughed out with sudden raucous cruelty
in the still cool night jim stirred in his
sleep but didnt waken she raised her-
self on one elbow and looked down at him
while her thoughts raced and danced
piling themselves into the bubble

alma and paulellerbe
  and then it burst and left her weak
with compassion seeing them together in
her minds eye seeing them as clearly as
the daylight that was climbing over gray
dome mountain that fragile empty
smart little thing and long jim briggs
gaunt weathered grizzled old jim-and
her shed no more be able to shoot than
to enter into her dead mothers womb
and be born again
  feeling as old as the granite hills that
ramparted the canon and with some-
thing too of their plain ineluctable dig-
nity she arose and dressed herself and
built the breakfast fire in the stove
  when jim came out to her she got slow-
ly to her feet closed the damper and
faced him
  jim she said that girl dont want
you take a good look at yourself in the
mirror over there and then think of her
shell throw you away like a sucked
orange when the moneys gone
  long jim briggs stood up with his head
in the rafters of the tiny room and stared
like an idiot
  i smelled her perfumery on your
coat said rosie shortly and compre-
hension dawned slowly in his face
  holy jumping june bugs he said
from somewhere down in his boots so
thats what you thought wait a min-
ute i was hidin it in the wood house
i wanted to surprize you
  in a moment he returned with a pack-
age with awkward swift movements he
ripped off the wrapping paper and shook
out the folds of a brilliant electric blue
plush dress of a fashion fallen into forgot-
ten desuetude ten years before
  he displayed it pridefully down the
front of his long person head a-cock and
a twinkle in his eye
  thats all there was between us
smell it the room reeked of orange
blossoms she made it for me nights
to make some extra money its the kind
you kep a picture of from a fashion book
i got it off your dresser do you-do you
like it rosie
  she tried to speak but could only nod
her head he patted her shoulder awk-
wardly the dress swam before her eyes
like a pane of blue glass in the rain
  its goin to be the swellest weddin
he said huskily that little old gray
dome ever seen an then- he cleared
his throat with a rumble like summer
thunder-were goin to denver an buy
a house on capitol hill an the finest auto
in town an a nigger to run it an drive
around an tell em all to go to hell
the story of a flying lieutenant who went a wol
in line of duty
a heavy truck lumbered
slowly along a road in central
france on both sides of the
road was an uninspiring vista
of brown fields stretching away as far
as the eye could reach and only occasion-
ally broken by small clumps of small
scrubby trees on the seat of the truck
beside the driver sat a little man with a
drooping mustache this droopiness was
evidence that he had come there by way
of paris when he reached the french
capital the mustache had been smartly
waxed
  finally he addressed the driver out of
sheer boredom
  pretty sad dump around here aint
it he remarked obviously
  sad inquired the truck driver a
horse faced man with a large bulge in his
cheek who suggested mules rather than
mechanical means of locomotion sad
say lieutenant you aint seen nuthin
yet wait till you see the fiyin field
they have to lay duckboards to get out
to the airyplanes on the only birds who
have a good time around there are the
dutchmen-prisoners you know i took
em out a load of beer and cognac this
morning and there was a hardboiled
mp sergeant ridin the load to make
sure it all got there an it did too and
then the lucky suckers work in the kitchen
and get all they want to eat too-the
dutch i mean makes me sick to think
o them krauts lyin around with nuthin
to do but stuff an guzzle while hard
workin guys like me- look theres the
field now
  he pointed ahead to a group of low


h p s greene
barrack buildings which clustered near
the road on the left hand side farther
away could be seen several hangars but
no signs of activity
  i dont see any flying going on re-
marked the lieutenant whose name was
tommy lang
  no an you wont probly till next
spring returned the driver
  he turned off the rough but hard road
through the gateway into the camp and
the engine of the truck began to labor as
its wheels sank deep into the soft mud so
he shifted into second once more the
truck lurched forward but only for a
moment the driver shifted back into
first but the new impetus gained was
only temporary and presently the chain-
less wheels spun vainly the driver shut
off his motor and climbed to the ground
  this is as far as we can go lieuten-
ant he said youll have to lug your
own baggage in from here the frogs
wont let us use chains on the road so they
took em away from us
  he proceeded around to the back of the
truck and let down the tailboard with a
bang tommy climbed down gingerly
but immediately sank almost to his
knees the driver was dragging out his
bed roll and trunk which fell to the
ground with a squashy sound then he
went around to the front of the truck and
began to labor at the crank
  what do i do now asked tommy
looking around
  there wasnt another soul anywhere in
sight
  report to the personnel officer up
there answered the driver waving his
arm vaguely toward the row of long
barrack buildings nearby so saying he
climbed once more to the seat and began
to churn his way backward toward firmer
ground
leaving the sad monument of his
baggage tommy sloughed through
-the mud until he reached a pathway
of duckboards which ran parallel to the
row of barracks on one of these build-
ings was a sign and as he approached it
the latest addition to the great american
flying field was able to see that it read
as follows
         personnel office
         for
         officers
         flying officers
         flying cadets
         cadets
  and the shepherd separates the sheep
from the goats thought tommy as he
climbed a short flight of steps and entered
the office the shepherd a small pot
bellied man with captains bars but no
wings on his serge blouse eyed the newest
flying lieutenant his whipcord uniform
and his papers with disfavor
   all right he said in a querulous voice
find yourself a bunk in the flying offi-
cers barrack you will be assigned to a
section for duty look on the bulletin
board in the operations office
  tommy saluted and went out he saw
his baggage still forming an island in the
sea of mud but it seemed to have shrunk
appreciably since he left it he had an
idea that he must salvage it before it dis-
appeared entirely
  walking along the duckboard he heard
a chorus of voices raised in ribald song
in one of the barracks and stopped feeling
that he had reached a friendly haven
when i joined the army i was clean and neat
now-
  the noise ceased abruptly as the flying
officer entered
  attention shouted one voice
  ma-a-a-a-ah said another
  the place was full of irreverent and
antagonistic cadets and tommy re-
treated feeling that it was not the time
to stop and explain that the only reason
he was not among them was through the
mistake of some nodding homer in wash-
ington in giving him a commission as
soon as he enlisted instead of when he got
his pilots license the song followed him
   the officers live on the top of the hill
   the flying cadets in the slush and the swill-
   i dont want any more array
   gee how i want to go home
in line of duty

  he came to the last barrack of all
which was only about three-fourths built
going inside he found it empty of human
life but the contents was reassuring
under the neatly spread double-decker
bunks were officers bools and the walls
were covered with overcoats bearing the
single stripe of a first lieutenant and with
various flying clothes and equipment
in what would be the middle of the long
building was a single large stove which
feebly radiated its rays of heat against
the blasts of cold damp air from the open
end near that end were several unoc-
cupied bunks one of which tommy de-
cided must be for him
it was commencing to get dark out-
side and colder too the little flyer
huddled closer to the stove and
smoked a cigaret somebody must come
in before long somebody did
  there was a clatter on the duckboards
outside and a horde of flying lieutenants
trouped in making loud noises and crowd-
ing around the stove tommy scanned
their faces anxiously but there was no-
body there he knew a tall thin man
eyed him in a friendly manner and
tommy asked him t help him with his
baggage the other assented readily
and they excavated the large french
trunk and fancy bed roll which marked a
man who had enlisted in paris and one
by one dragged them inside
  you might as well take this bunk next
to me and fat said the tall man who
was known as long john we got left
behind for a day in paris by accident and
when we got here the barrack was almost
full up so we had to take bunks near the
end what ground school did you go to
i never went to ground school re-
turned tommy i was an ambulance
driver and enlisted in paris
  he looked around curiously at his
companions in the barrack they were
of an unfamiliar genus men who had had
their preliminary training and got their
commissions in the states
  there were various strange divisions in
the early days of the air service in france
at the french school at tours there were
outwardly at least several different
breeds of americans first the foreign
legion trained there and then a lost or
strayed detachment of american gobs
then the army started enlisting men in
paris mostly former ambulance drivers
who continued the old feud between the
american ambulance and norton harjes
but united in scorn for those whose service
had been confined to the mexican
border
  then one day a body of men marched
into camp in column of fours a military
evolution which the ambulance drivers
regarded with pitying contempt
  who are those men the question
ran around
  ground school men was the reply
and the ex-ambulanciers immediately
joined together in one clique against the
others
  now tommy was meeting a new divi-
sion in the ranks of the flyers-those who
had not only been to ground school but
had had preliminary flying training in
the states
  he inquired after various of his friends
only to find that they had been trans-
ferred to a more advanced field and
realizing that more than an hour still re-
mained before supper he started down
the road toward a house he had noticed
when the truck brought him to the field
perhaps he might find a drink there and
possibly some one he knew he was cold
and shivering and thought longingly of
the woolen underwear sent him by an
aunt which was buried in his trunk for
years he had worn nothing but so-called
athletic underwear but the time had
evidently come to change
  he approached the house a solitary
farm but still somehow suggestive of
liquid refreshment the door stood open
hospitably and he walked in his nose
had not deceived him for though there
was no ne in the room a small bar stood
along one end and when the gnarled
stooped lady of the establishment came
in he ordered a glass of rum the strong
liquor warmed him

h p s greene
  there was a puttering roar outside and
a motorcycle pulled up at the door
tommy observed the evident agitation of
the madame with surprise then a man
with a hard face came inside he looked
at tommy threateningly
  have a drink invited the little pilot
in friendly tones
  he hated to drink alone even if he was
cold the other who wore a brassard
around his arm like a stretcher bearer in
the french army agreed in a surly man-
ner tommy wondered who the fellow
was as he gulped his drink and waited to
see if the other would return the compli-
ment as was in vogue in those days he
didnt and tommy turned to leave
  hey feller said the surly one
guess ill have another one
  sure if you like answered tommy
surprised
  he ordered and paid for another round
there was something peculiar here that
he didnt understand just then there
was the sound of another motorcycle
outside
  the officer of the day exclaimed the
tough man with the arm band rushing
out tommy heard his voice raised
placatingly
  yes sir it said i just went in to
see if there was anybody inside but there
was no one there
  all right get on with the patrol said
another voice
  the two motorcycles roared away
tommy was bewildered he left the
cafe and walked back to the barrack
perhaps he could find out there what it all
meant although he bore lieutenants
bars on his shoulders he was as innocent
of the army and its ways as a baby
 at the open ended barrack he
found the flying lieutenants gath-
- ered around the stove among
them was long john and he singled him
out and told him his queer story to
tommys surprise he burst into raucous
laughter
  heyfat hey guys listen to this
will ya this bird goes up the road to
the cafe thats out of bounds and when
the mp comes in he asks him to have a
drink
 chorus-
  yeah
  yeah and then he wonders why the
mp dont buy him one
 no
  fact and then the mp tells him to
buy another one and he does
 yeah
  and then the officer of the day drives
up and the mp tells him theres no-
body in there and they ride off and now
this bird wants to know what its all
about
  a howl of glee went up and from that
moment tommy became a marked man
at issy-la-boue as he had a habit of doing
everywhere he went
  a bugle blew at this juncture and all the
flying officers rushed to their bunks and
seized peculiar looking instruments with
which they went outside still wonder-
ing tommy followed them
it was dark by that time but he
could see them trouping into a
brightly lighted building and he fol-
lowed there they had formed in line
and were approaching a counter behind
which stood cropheaded fat men who
were ladling out what tommys nose
told him was food
  as they were served the flyers hurried
away to seat themselves on long benches
at bare wooden tables and wolf their meal
tommy accosted the large man whom
long john had addressed as fat whose
bulk had evidently cut down his speed
so that he was near to the end of the line
  say he asked where do i get some
of those things they eat out of
  what aint you got no messkit
queried fat youll have to draw one
in the morning for tonight youd better
borrow long johns hes always in the
head of the line when the doors open and
he eats faster than any man in the outfit
but where have you been in the army not
to have a messkit
  we always ate in the canteen at the
in line of duty

french flying school until the y m c a
came along and closed it up because they
served wine there answered tommy
they made a speech about the evils of
drink and were going to serve chocolate
instead but the chocolate never came
after that we generally ate at the
greasy spoon across the road because
they didnt serve anything but boiled
beef and boiled potatoes at the mess
hall but even there they furnished
dishes
  well youll get no dishes furnished
here said fat but look there goes
long john already follow him out to
the tubs and get his messkit when he gets
through washing it
  tommy trailed the tall man out into
the cold dark night where several dim
forms could be seen and heard slopping
around near two large tubs on the ground
as john rose from his task and shook his
tools in lieu of wiping them tommy
accosted him and borrowed the messkit
then he rushed back into the mess hall
just in time to get the last of the slum
he eyed the german k ps with some
misgiving
  it occurred to him that it would be a
fine opportunity for some patriotic boche
to wash out the american air service by
a judicious application of ground glass or
rough-on-rats but he ate the slum which
was fairly good though teutonically
greasy
  then he went outside to the tubs
where the late eaters were still trying to
wash their utensils by this time the
water was stone cold and full of frag-
ments of food cries for more hot wasser
rent the air but the german k ps only
stood in their warm kitchen and laughed
and made guttural and doubtless insult-
ing remarks in reply after the iron
discipline of their own army they were
tickled pink at the opportunity to insult
any kind of officer even an american
aviator who was the lowest of the low
tommy wiped most of the grease out of
his dish with his handkerchief and then
returned the mess kit to long john at the
barrack with an apology
the tall man and fat were
about to start for the operations
room to find out the schedule for
the next day and invited tommy to
come along on the bulletin board he
found that he had been assigned to sec-
tion  various other changes in sect ions
were posted butnthe last one took his eye
it read
st lieut john smith a s s o r c
transferred from section  to death in line of duty
by order of
-herman krause major signal corps
  whats the idea ordering some guy to
death in line of duty he asked long
john
  huh oh they always do that when
some bird gets bumped answered the
tall man youre in section  same
as me we go to rotary motors in the
morning and then machine gun
  what do you mean rotary motors
inquired tommy
  oh theyve got one of these le
rhone motors like they have in the
nieuports mounted on a block over at
the hangars and some goof gives a lecture
about it and then we practise twiddling
the little levers-manettes they call
em-that make it go weve had it four
or five times already they always give
it to us when they cant think of any-
thing else for us to do
  but ive flown hundreds of miles with
rotary motors tommy exclaimed i
made all my voyages and my altitude test
for my brevet with them
  never mind that returned long
john youll probably have all the more
lectures about em on that account
they returned to the barrack and
tommy started to unpack his things
from his bed roll he produced a pair of
rubber boots made in such a close imita-
tion of regulation officers boots that it
took a close inspection to see that they
werent the real article
what a trick for roll call mornings
exclaimed fat looking at them enviously
you know we have roll call at six
oclock and then we have to wait until

h p s greene
seven for breakfast most of the fellows
just put on boots and overcoats to stand
the call and then come back to bed
again you can pull those things on in a
minute and get by with them
  a good idea proclaimed tommy
and went to bed with that idea in mind
he was going to dig out his heavy under-
wear that night but decided that it was
too cold and that he would do it in the
morning
meanwhile there was another
conference going on at head-
quarters major krause the
commanding officer of the field a red
faced apoplectic man whose military
heroes were frederick the great and
baron von steuben was roaring at the ad-
jutant his yes man
  here they are he bellowed sending
us another squadron of mechanics when
we havent got half enough room or work
for the ones we have now i dont know
what well do with them well have to t ry
to pry another of those folding barracks out
of the french and they have no officers
and neither have we though theres a
whole camp full of young fools with com-
missions around here but well have to
pick out one of them to command the
squadron just to sign the reports that go
in have you anybody to suggest
well said the adjutant heres a
man got in today named lang whose
commission dates back to september
earlier than most of the others but i dont
know anything about him
  i know too much about most of the
others said major krause give him
a trial perhaps he may know something
about his military duties by the way
did you tell the commanding officer of
those officers in the unfinished barrack
that if they wanted it finished they could
do it themselves
  yes sir and they said they hadnt
got cards to the flying carpentersunion
and they didnt give a damn whether it
was finished or not they kicked a lot
about having to go out and pick up stones
off the flying field in full uniform too
because the german prisoners stood
around and laughed at them
  they did did they roared major
krause what they need is discipline
and im going to give it to them tell
captain yuma to give them an hours
close order drill every morning after roll
call
  yes sir said the adjutant with
satisfaction
next morning tommy woke
with a start he was cold and
cramped from the night on the
narrow bunk with insufficient blankets
and for a moment he thought that he was
back in the ambulance sleeping on a
stretcher then he saw the other flyers
rushing out of the barrack and realized
where he was he rolled quickly out of
his bunk dragged on the rubber boots
shuffled into his trench coat which barely
covered his bare knees grabbed his hat
and ran out after them only to slip and
come turn bling o ut of the barrack head first
amid hoarse guffaws from the other suf-
ferers lined up outside it had snowed a
couple of inches during the night and the
sharp flakes bit into his tender knees he
scrambled to his feet and lined up with
the rest
  the short fat captain to whom he had
reported the day before called the roll
in his squeaky voice and then at the top
of his lungs cried-
  squads right
  a horrified look ran up and down the
scantily clad ranks but the march
followed grimly and inevitably the
captain who had been a real estate broker
two short months before had forgotten to
have them call off and they broke into a
milling mob
  as you were he howled
  the ranks formed again after a con-
siderable delay during which several
men tried to sneak around the corner of
the barrack and the captain finally got
them marched away to tommy as
well as to the late realtor and most of the
rest it was a doleful hike with every
step the man in front scuffed snow and
in line of duty

equally cold mud up against his bare raw
knees and soon his boots were full
   in other parts of the great field where
 they marched there were other proces-
 sions of unfortunates one of flying cadets
 one of cadets and also several companies
 of mechanics they however had the
 advantage of expecting the march and
 were fully dressed most of the flying
 lieutenants were not but at last it came
 to an end and in the doubtful shelter of
 the barrack once more tommy wiped the
 mud from his cold wet knees with a towel
   where can i take a bath he asked
long john
   john cackled with raucous glee
bath he snorted hey guys
heres an hombre wants to know where he
can take a bath
   bath said fat why paris is the
last place i had a bath and i dont expect
to have another one till i die and go back
there youll get no baths here theres
a bath-house in town but you cant go
there for the posts been quarantined ever
since it was started the mps know
that anybody that goes a w o l will
want a bath so they keep a special guard
ov er the bath-house to pick you up just
like at the barrooms
   they dressed wentto the mess hall for
 beans washed their mess kits and then
 formed in sections to march to classes
 first section  spent an hour standing
 around in the blast from the propeller of a
 rotary motor and then went to an un-
 heated barrack to handle the icy parts
 of a lewis machine gun after which
 they were allowed to escape to the red
 cross hut and buy some hot coffee hard-
 ly had they reached this haven when an
 orderly entered
  lieutenant lang he bawled is
lieutenant lang here
   tommy took an envelope addressed to
him signed for it and opened it with ap-
prehension this was well justified for
the letter told him to assume command of
fethe th aero squadron upon its arrival
at the field he showed it to fat and long
john who once more burst into laughter
can you imagine the lucky little
stiff john inquired of the world in
general heres a guy knows so little
about the army that he doesnt even
know an mp when he sees one and
here he gets command of a squadron
youll get out of reveille and standing
morning formation on that and have an
orderly to shine your boots for you you
can have them build off a separate room
for you in their barrack with a stove in
it pretty soft for a squadron com-
mander ill say
 but what will i command them to
do tommy asked anxiously
 let old krause and the adjutant
worry about that returned john
theyll find plenty of commands for
you but turn everything over to your
top sergeant and make him do it tell
him look here sergeant if you wont
bother me i wont bother you then
all you have to do is look wise and sign
the papers that the sergeant-major or
staff sergeant bring you and keep out of
krauses way
when the squadron arrived tom-
my followed johns half joking
advice and found that it suc-
ceeded admirably the men partitioned
off one end of the barrack after they got
it up and there made an office for the
sergeant-major and one for tommy in
which he set up a g m cot of course
this office had to have a stove and so it
served splendidly for quiet games of stud
which continued long after lights were out
in the quarters of the flying lieutenants
less fortunate than tommy and his
cronies and he got along well in his
command by keeping out of sight and
signing unquestioningly the morning re-
ports rosters ration reports and what-
nots his sergeants brought him
  but one morning the sergeant-major
approached him with a troubled face
  i dont know what to do about this
lieutenant he said holding out a letter
i sent it to the adjutant three times and
he always sends it back marked incor-
rect you see they have held up cor-
poral letars pay on account of a tailors

h p s greene
bill against him for twenty-five cents for
repairing his breeches at shenannigan
field texas now here is his service
record and it shows a deduction of a
quarter made there in july for fixing his
breeches and he says thats the only time
he ever had it done but theyve been
holding up his pay for three months
holding up his pay have they said
tommy angrily sent the letter back
three times well see about that ill
take it up to the adjutant myself
  he entered the adjutants office and
spoke loudly
  say whats all this about corporal
letars pants heres the letter all
o k-just as his service record shows
twenty-five cents was deducted from
corporal letars pay in july at shenan-
nigan field texas for repairing his
pants 
  ah thats whats wrong replied the
adjutant smoothly wheres your gram-
mar havent you ever been to school
what you should say is twenty-five
cents were deducted from corporal letars
pay at shenannigan field texas- 
whats this burst an angry roar
from an inner office as major krause
rushed out whats all this about pants
whos this talking about pants dont
you know theres no such thing in the
united states army as pants who are
you young man
  tommy stood speechless at the out-
burst why oh why hadnt he kept on
following long johns advice about keep-
ing out of sight
  this is lieutenant lang sir said
the adjutant silkily the commanding
officer of the th aero squadron on this
post we were discussing a very serious
error in one of his reports
  oh it is is it said major krause
angrily i was going to send for you i
issued orders that all commanding officers
of organizations on this post should per-
sonally give their units an hours close
order drill every morning yesterday
morning i saw a sergeant drilling your
squadron where were you sir why
werent you drilling them yourself
  why blurted tommy i dont know
how to drill em i never drilled anybody
in my life
  what you a commissioned officer
in the united states army stand there
and admit that you are not capable of
drilling the men under your command
well sir you are hereby relieved from
that command remove yourself and
your belongings from the th squadrons
barrack at once to make room for your
successor and young man remember
this never give you dont know how
as an excuse in the united states army
if you dont knoto how learn how if you
get an order do it and if you cant do it
do as near it as you can that will do
you may go
tommy dragged himself away dis-
consolately and had a couple of
men of his late command carry his
stuff back to the barrack with the open
end it was colder than ever now after the
warm quarters from which he had been
ousted but on the other hand perhaps
this was a blessing in disguise he had
been flying lately and had graduated
from the penguins whose wings were too
short to fly and from the gawky twenty-
three meter nieuports and now he was on
the eighteens
  he ought to be finished with them soon
and then he would be due to move away
from the main field to field  for the
smaller faster fifteen meter machines
perhaps there would have been some
hitch about going if hed been hooked up
with the squadron but now he could leave
as soon as he was ready
  and he was ready to go somewhere
too hed now been quarantined at issy-
la-boue for over a month and hadnt been
able to leave the post for a bath if it
wasnt the measles or the mumps it was
the chicken pox or somebody had a sore
toe there was a spreading line of red
blotches around his waist and he knew
only too well what it was the scabies
and from his experience with the french
he knew there was only one cure-hot
sulphur baths with a scrubbing brush and
in line of duty

plenty of them they had them at the
bath-house in town but he couldnt get
away howeaer perhaps something would
turn up it always did sooner or later
  it did the next day he finished flying
early and returned to the barrack as he
came in the telephone rang and he an-
swered an excited voiced called
  hello is this the main field this is
field  tommy lang just crashed here
in an eighteen
  hah said tommy
  yeah deadern a doornail too the
whole top of his heads gone above the
eyes an awful mess the only
way we knew who it was was by his
mustache
  the spreader of bad news hung up
leaving tommy dazed he pinched him-
self to make sure that he was alive it
must be phil who had crashed he had a
mustache like tommys own but he was
about six feet tall while tommy was
nearer five however no doubt he had been
crumpled up like an accordion in the fall
then tommy had another thought he
seized the telephone receiver and called
the adjutant
iater that evening when the orderly
came to the operations office with
- notices for the bulletin board tom-
my was waiting for him an hour later
found him luxuriating in a hot sulphur
bath in the town of issy-la-boue he had
caught a ride on a french truck from the
field and there had been no mps on
duty when he went in when he came
out there were two near the door but the
night was pitch dark and they were
wrangling about something-a girl ap-
parently-and he passed unnoticed then
he sought a hotel
  the madame in charge was cordial and
voluble
  but yes she had plenty of room that
sale guerrel there were hardly any com-
mercial travelers nowadays and then
that salaud of a chief american gen-
darme who spent nothing himself and
forbade her hotel to other brave ameri-
cans who would indeed he had closed
all the cafes and hotels in town to his
countrymen and opened a cafe of
his own importing two petites femmes
from paris to run it for him but
there was another american officer-a
man very distinguished-at her hotel who
appeared lonesome perhaps this worthy
monsieur would like to join him
  she led tommy to a small office of some
sort wherein a man in american uniform
was sitting gloomily alone before a bottle
of wine the little pilot recoiled at sight
of the gold leaves on his shoulders but it
wasnt major krause who sat there on
this majors blouse were the legion of
honor the medaille muitaire and the
croix de guerre with many palms instead
of the jingling hardware krause carried
to show that he was a marksman or
something and this mans face lit up with
a welcoming smile instead of the con-
gested dignity habitual with the com-
manding officer of the flying field of issy-
la-boue tommy gasped as he realized
that he was in the presence of the great
ace himself
  he sat down at the others invitation
and had a glass of wine they joined in
lamenting the fact that they couldnt
hang all mps on the meat-hooks in
front of butcher shops as the poilus did
the gendarmes at verdun and agreed that
the french are a great people
  look at me said the ace gloomily
when i took this commission i had no
idea that they were going to order me
away from the front but now all the
others are killing more boches and get-
ting ahead of me while i rot in this hole
they sent me back here to help train you
fellows but major krause wouldnt pay
any attention to what i said so i left
i heard some guy who had never flown
over the front give you a lecture on how to
do it and when he said that if you got lost
over germany the way to find out where
you were was to fly down and read the
name on some railway station i couldnt
bear it any more i dont know what the
devil to do-im not doing any good
around here
  his gloom was justified a few months

h p s greene
later he was shot down in flames in a
machine condemned by the french
  they heard the voice of the madame
raised in loud objurgations outside but
there was a knock at the door afad im-
mediately a man entered he wore the
uniform of a first lieutenant and on his
arm the brassard of an mp but his
truculence subsided into oiliness at the
sight of the majors leaves
  excuse me major he said but
orders are very strict you know major
krause is very particular that no flying
officer should leave the post under any
conditions i beg your pardon lieuten-
ant but have you got a pass
  hes with me said the ace shortly
  oh said the mp uncertainly and
went out he wasnt sure exactly what
the aces status was but his rank was
plain enough and the mp was afraid of
burning his fingers
  wait till that guy catches me alone
said tommy
  stick around with me said the ace
krause doesnt quite know what to do
about me yet for ive got a pull in paris
and hes let me alone since i left the
field
for three days tommy did
stick and lived the life of riley
sleeping in a good bed eating good
meals drinking good wine and taking
sulphur baths twice a day at the end of
that time his scabies was gone
  i guess id better be getting back to
the field he told the ace i want to
get through there and get to the front
i took an awful chance going a w o l
but maybe my little scheme will work on
krause if it doesnt and he takes me off
flying ill be sunk think i might as well
go out and let that mp pick me up and
give me a ride back to camp
  he shook hands with the ace and
walked out and down the street alone
  he hadnt gone far when a ford drew
up beside him and stopped in the front
seat was the mp lieutenant and behind
a hard-boiled sergeant with a 
  hey said the lieutenant in rough
tones lets see your pass
  i aint got a pass the little man re-
turned
  all right then youre under arrest
get in here and ill take you out to the
field
  tommy obeyed meekly and they rode
along without conversation presently
he was ushered into the presence of
major krause
  what growled the major in town
without a pass eh what have you got
to say for yourself young man
  well tommy replied the other
day you told me never to question an
order in the army and if i couldnt obey
an order to come as near it as i could
what rigamarole is this asked
major krause angrily do you mean
to stand there and tell me i ordered you to
go a w o l
  not exactly sir answered tommy
respectfully but you see this order
here i couldnt see my way clear to
carry it out so i thought id better leave
here so as not to embarrass you
 major krause looked at the paper
tommy extended and his eyes goggled
his face became more congested than
ever and wrinkles corrugated his brow
what could he do if he court-martialed
this young idiot this order would un-
doubtedly be his defense and krauses
dignity a carefully tended hothouse
plant of uncertain virility could hardly
survive so he waved his arms in a
furious gesture of dismissal and gurgled
like an active volcano and tommy
saluted and left discreetly
  the paper he had given krause read
st lieut thomas lang a s s o r c
trausferred from section  to death in line of duty

old man stitch-away old man sails
with his long gray beard hes as hard as nails
his teeth are yellow and his eyes are gray
and hes seaming and hes roping all the livelong day
stitch away stitch away sew them strong
for the lofty spars where they belong
rope them tight and seam them true
so never a capful of wind blows through
a big ships topsails a big ships courses
royals and skysails a big ships wings
to race her along through the wild white horses
to lift her high where the comber swings
stitch them sails aye sew them tight
for the mad squall blowing in the maniac night
sew them to stand the beat of hail
the lash of rain and the hurricanes flail
sew them strong so theyll never rip
when were bow to bow with a rival ship
bolt on bolt of canvas high to tower in a pyramid to the sky
bolt on bolt of canvas wide to cast swift shadows on the blue seas tide
bolt on bolt of canvas white to gleam in the glory of the tropic night
and if theres a little bit of sail left over
save it sails for a fellow rover
old man sails with his gray head bowed
hes sitting and hes stitching at a dead mans shroud

 the man who
hated himself
by walt
every stockman in the north-
west recalls the hard winter of
- it broke most of them
one cattleman spending his
winter in the south wrote back to his
ranch to inquire how his stuff was winter-
ing his line rider took a pencil and
drew the picture of a starving cow hung
up in the drifts under it he wrote
  waiting for a chinook the last of the five
  thousand
  the man who drew that picture was
charlie russell the daddy of them all
when it came to putting the cow and the
horse and the indian and the cowpuncher
on canvas or in clay but in  charlie
was a cowpuncher
  this is not a story about charlie rus-
sell he is mentioned no more in the tale
i speak of him here because when a cow-
man of montana recalls the winter of 
he invariably mentions that picture of
charlie russells as an illustration for his
tale of hardship it tells better than any
words the bitter curse of that hard winter
  the circle c outfit made their last
shipment of steers along about the first of
november that fall it was spitting snow
when they finished loading the cattle
train pulled out for chicago the boys
rode back to where the roundup wagon
was camped on main alkali they
gulped down hot food and black coffee
caught out their town horses and headed
for malta
  as they jogged along the road with their
ears tied up with silk handkerchiefs heads
bent against the raw wind big buck bell
rode up alongside the wagon boss
  winters done come horace grunted
buck fashioning a cigaret with numbing
fingers
  shore has returned horace humped
across his saddle horn
  makes a man wonder whats become
of his summers wages buck led up to
his subject
  horace nodded a trifle absently he
was wondering how hed get his mess
wagon loaded and started for the ranch
before the cook got too drunk to handle
his four lines
  hows chances fer a winters job
coburn
ridin line horace buck tried to keep
the eager tremor out of his voice
  were full handed fer the winter bell
you should a tackled me a month ago
  a month ago said buck bell with
grim humor i was fattern a bear in
berry season had a thousand dollars
had a idee i was a top hand at draw
poker the nighthawk took me fer my
roll
  this story of tough luck was not a new
one to the ears of the wagon boss it is
a tale as old as the oldest cow hand
horace still thinking of the cook missed
the flicker of disappointment in buck bells
snow bitten eyes he failed to see the
beaten droop of the big boned shoulders
inadequately clothed in a soiled flannel
shirt and two undershirts buck didnt
own an overcoat his boots were rusty
and he kicked his toes against his stir-
rups as he rode by way of restoring cir-
culation
l
ooks like when a man begun gittin
white beaded said horace as
they dropped down the ridge to-
ward town hed have sense enough to
save a winter stake
  he did not mean to be unkind there
wasnt aimean drop of blood in the cow
bosss veins he was sorry for buck
bell and hid his softer emotions under
the words he now mumbled into the up-
turned collar of a threadbare coat truth-
fully speaking horace himself was prodi-

        a powerful story of the montana cattle
        trails and the great bliiard of 

walt coburn
gal as the rest of the cowpuncher clan
  buck took a last pull at the bit of stub
of cigaret and threw it away then he
chuckled softly they were riding down
the lane that approached town to the
left of them was the malta graveyard the
wooden slabs whitening with the first
snow
  what struck you as bein so comical
buck
  just thinkin how them boys planted
in yonder boothill dont need worry no
more about winter jobs and coonskin
coats they aint got the coin to buy i
kin name three-four that i bet is plenty
warm where they went
  they rode into town and put their
horses in the feed barn the stalls were
filling with circle c horses there was an
unwritten law of the outfit that a man
must stable his horse before he got drunk
  over at dick powells place the boys
were paid off dick saloon man and
sheriff voiced his friendly warning
  the towns yourn boys take care
of er
  the hard earned money went into swift
circulation the tin horn gamblers open-
ed up their games bartenders set up free
drinks at proper intervals to the laughing
cussing free harrded men who lined the
bar and swapped yarns and thawed out
  boot heels clicked on the pine board
floors spurs jingled along the streets
  cant spender all in one place
  they moved along to the next saloon
crumpled banknotes lay along the bar
the men greeted old friends jov ial bar-
tenders most of them old time cow-
punchers wiped right hands on soiled
aprons and voiced profane welcome
  fiddles squeaked above the voices
loosened by the whisky tin pan pianos
banged lights defied the coming dusk
of early night there would be no night
guard to stand tonight no long circle to
ride in the early dawn while their money
lasted these cowboys owned the town
  buck bell found the nighthawk sitting
in a monte game
  heres that fifty dollars you still got
cornin cotton eye
  the nighthawk looked up grinned and
shook his head
  to hell with you an your fifty buck
pay me half when you die the rest
when you come back im winnin off
this gamblin man
  buck grunted an indistinct thanks and
clumped up to the bar
  a little red licker dick give the
boys what they want wake up that
sheepherder in the comer and tell the
gentleman that ol buck bell is in town
im a red eyed wolf from bitter crick and
its my night to howl whereupon he
howled long and loud with a quivering
high keyed sadness in his voice
ee you later buck said as he
moved on out and along the
street
  the wind moaned darkly down the
lonesome lane between the rows of saloons
and stores he stood with bowed legs
spread wide thumbs hung in his sagging
cartridge belt leaning a little against the
storm his howl was blotted out in a
flurry of snow that was ushering in the
long winter buck felt sad in spite of the
dozen drinks under his belt sad and
lonesome and restless he belonged down
in texas and he was a long way from
home he had aimed to go back home
this winter wearing store clothes and
with coin in his pockets but cotton eye
had cleaned him he crossed over to
long henrys and was promptly pulled
up to the bar by several celebrants buck
tossed out a ten dollar bill with the air
of a man who scorns money somebody
was singing sam bass
  sam bass is a ballad that extolls the
deeds of that notorious texas outlaw
the old time outlaw has always held a
place in the hearts of the cowpunchers
his vices are buried his virtues real or
imaginary live on in cowland saga
   sam first came to texas a cowboy for to be-
   a kinder hearted feller you seldom ever see
  buck bell twirled his whisky glass
between thumb and forefinger the
singer had a good voice and his audience
the man who hated himself

was mellow and prone to the sentiment
that has to do with white haired mothers
golden haired sweethearts and gene-
rosity of dying outlaws
sam met lis fate at round rock july the
   twenty-first
  they pierced poor sam with rifle balls and
   emptied out his purse
  jim had borrowed sams good gold and didnt
   want to pay
   so the only shot he saw was to give poor sam
   away
    he sold out sam  
   buck bell nodded at his dim reflection
in the mirror above the back bar
   i usta work dost to round rock he
told the man next to him
   he downed his drink at one gulp and
reachcd for the bar bottle as it came down
along the line he became more quiet
more thoughtful as the night wore on
that haunted restlessness drove him out
to the deserted street he drifted alone
and wrapped in brooding thought into
cavanaughs
   the negro piano player knew the song
of sam bass he sang it through three
times for buck buck gave him ten dol-
lars only ten more remained in his over-
alls pocket	
iy more drinks buck bell
for a place across the
his last ten was spent
his heart was as empty as his pockets
the mournful shriek of a locomotive
made him shiver as he halted in the lee
of the station to light a cigaret the
train dispatcher stepped out of the
lighted telegraph office an eyeshade
across his forehead train orders in his
hand he did not see the tall form of
buck bell leaning a little unsteadily in
the darkness just to one side of the loco-
motive headlight
   no  squealed to a halt to deposit two
sleepy traveling drummers the door of
the express car opened the armed mes-
senger dropped a heavy iron box on the
waiting truck alongside the car the
train dispatcher was now signing for the
box the drummers hurried for the
malta house
  payroll for the mines the express
messenger explained wish  had that
much id quit riding these damn night
runs blizzard cornin
  the door of the express car slid shut
a yellow lantern circled in the night the
train pulled out slowly and the dispatcher
wheeled away the truck with its steel box
  the wheels of the truck creaked its dis-
mal passage the form of buck bell
moved in a blackness made more opaque
by the departure of the train lights the
man was pushing the truck within arms
reach of the tall cowboy
  buck lifted his gun from its old scab-
bard he balanced its weight in his hand
moved out of his tracks swung the long
barrel in a swift arc the man wheeling
the truck slumped down gently an indis-
tinct lump on the deserted platform
  buck bell moved swiftly now he
picked the steel box up in his arms and
ran down the tracks he did not halt
until he reached the stockyards a mile or
more from town he hid the box under
the loading chute then started back
  the walk in the cold air had driven the
whisky fog from his brain buck was
sober now the sadness the brooding
restlessness had gone and in its place
came swift regrets he fought down those
regrets as best he could hed been a fool
to do it but he was into it now hed
hang and rattle play er out as the cards
fell and ask no man for better than even
odds he wondered how hard hed hit
that depot feller cant let a man lay out
in the cold that way besides there was
the trains to attend to
  but as he circled the depot he saw the
sheriff and the train dispatcher talking
earnestly inside the lighted telegraph and
ticket office buck moved away across to
dick powells place nobody took notice
of his entrance as he slipped in the back
door and dropped into a chair by the
stove then somebody called the house
up for a drink and buck joined the crowd
he had not been missed
  hows things stackin up buck it
k
fter me
  started
  tracks

walt coburn
was old horace who voiced the question
need a little money i was talkin to
the old gent and he said to let you have
what you need you kin come back and
work it out in the spring it aint every
man id do that fer but like i was tellin
the old gent youre on the square and
kin be depended on
  bucks mouth opened then closed
without saying a word he had been on
the verge of telling the wagon boss the
whole thing until now buck bell had
accepted the trust of his fellowmen as a
matter of course now well now it was
all over he was beginning to pay already
for his crime
  ill just make er out fer a hundred dol-
lars buck
  horace was misinterpreting the cow-
boys silence buck shook his head
  id ruther not horace ill make er
somehow its right white of you and the
old gent i wont fergit it
the sheriff came in an icy gust
of wind and snow following him in-
side the lamplit smoke hazed saloon
dick powell was a blunt statured man
husky reddish of hair with keen gray
eyes and a drooping mustache a good
natured sort of fellow who was rated as
a crackerjack cow hand the grin on
dicks mouth held a grim twist as his eyes
swept the crowd with slow deliberation
  belly up to the mahogany dick
invited some one
  dick powell did not seem to hear a
hush fell over the gathering the fiddle
in the hands of a cree breed squeaked
thinly and wet silent the bartender
from force of habit reached for the sawed
off shotgun under the bar
  boys said the blocky sheriff his
voice heavy with sadness rather than
anger theres a damn skunk amongst us
tonight when you boys rode in i give
you the run of the town a man hates to
think he has to watch boys that hes
worked with in the wet and cold and hot
weather i never thought a circle c man
would coyote on me
  what the hell you drivin at dick
asked horace his mild eyes glinting a
little
  some polecat knocked the depot man
on the head and got off with five thousand
dollars thats all
  where did that key pounder ever git
five thousand bucks asked some one
  payroll fer the landusky mine five
thousand in cash
  well drawled cotton eye the night-
hawk i reckon them mine folks will keep
on runnin things just the same have a
drink and fergit it
  whoever lifted that roll wont have to
worry none about forkin hay and openin
water holes this winter chuckled another
cowboy
  dad burn the luck complained a
third why didnt i think about glaumin
that payroll now i gotta break out of a
early mornin from now till spring shovel-
in hay into a lot o bawlin dogies some
gents gits all the luck
  but for all their banter they felt
uneasy who among them had stolen
that five thousand dollars  oddly enough
no man blamed the thief they rather
admired his ingenuity he had made a
lucky haul
  well dick said horace slowly
whoever done it must a been blind
drunk you know every man in the
outfit there aint one rotten egg in the
bunch say how do you know it want
some tramp er some stray miner that done
it
  the depot man heard his spurs jingle
so he says growled the sheriff just
before he got beefed it was some cow
hand and outside of you boys there
aint a cowboy in town he heard them
spurs
  got ary idee who might a done it
asked horace
  if i have ill keep it to myself came
the tart reply i look to you boys to
lend me a hand and all i git is some
horrawin
  no need to git hot about it grinned
the wagon boss toying with his drink
  the sheriff ignored that remark and
turned to his bartender
the man who hated himself

  was all of these men in the place at
midnight when no  come in
  the bartender smoothed his bald head
in grave thought he had taken a goodly
amount of drinks since the boys got in
owl eyed he tallied the crowd
  near as i kin recollect dick not a
man o them has left since i come back
from supper-t eleven
  then that alibis this bunch of cow
dodgers and the sheriff moved on out
and down the street
the robbery gave the cow-
punchers a meaty topic for talk-
talk and more drinks they hit
upon the idea of following dick powell
in his sleuthing
  from one saloon to the next they wad-
dled in the wake of the annoyed sheriff
the crowd had taken on numbers until by
the time they reached the bloody heart
the entire outfit was crowded into the
saloon
  various bartenders had furnished iron-
clad alibis for every circle c man powell
gave up in disgust and slipped away from
the throng which was growing somewhat
boisterous horace followed the sheriff
out the back door twenty-five cow-
punchers set about to make the most of
the momentous occasion
 months of hard work in the saddle and
branding corrals without a holiday long
days from the crack of dawn until dark
with two hours night guard for good
measure had starved them for a little fun
these men belonged to a breed that has
no equal for forty dollars a month and
grub they ride mean horses face death
and hunger and thirst and cold and bitter
discomforts they ask no favors whine
out no complaint taking the good along
with the bad it is all in a days work
most of them were cowmen at twelve
years of age at sixty there would be
much of the boy left in their big hearts
it is not for those who have not known
their breed to censure their faults they
lived according to their lights
  john law and his rules meant little in
their lives they had a way of settling
personal affairs those men who roamed
the west in the eighties when the country
needed them
  so they held kangaroo court the bar-
tender at the bloody heart was found
guilty and fined several rounds of drinks
then they moved on to the next saloon
and again held court another dispenser
of redeye was found guilty guilty as
hell by ballot the fine was duly paid in
liquid form and at daybreak they had
routed the sheriff from his warm bed
stood him up on the bar clad in a knee
length nightshirt boots hat and a cold
cigaret ballots were passed signed and
dropped in dicks hat he read them
one by one
  guilty as hell
  gash damn you bonehead misfit
loco idiots
  but he paid the fine setting out the
glasses and bottle with his own hand
  it was a large night guns popped
jubilant greeting to a day that held no
hard ride after stray cattle
  most of them were flat broke cotton
eye the bloated financier had lost his
money and hocked his spurs for a bottle
to take along then he engaged the bar-
tender in conversation while a confederate
stole back the spurs
  horace gathered his men one by one
mounted them and started them out of
town they bucked their horses down
the street emptying their guns at a leaden
sky behind them was their nights plea-
sure ahead lay the dread winter
buck bell got his private horse
from the barn because he owned
no overcoat he donned his slicker
and wrapped his feet in strips of gunny-
sack alone his hat pulled down across
his eyes his ungloved hands shoved down
against the saddle cantle he rode out of
town
  as he neared the stockyards he glanced
about no living thing moved in the
snow swept world that met his eye he
swung off his horse and dragged the steel
box from under the loading chute a
heavy padlock fastened it buck drew

walt coburn
his  and shot off the lock his stiff
fingers pried up the lid there lay the
banknotes in piles bound with wide rub-
ber bands he shoved the money into
the deep pockets of his angora chaps
then he buried the empty metal box in
the debris under the chute
  five minutes later he rode on again
into the storm he looked old and sadly
troubled the bitter cold was pinching
the color from his face he was a little
sick from the liquor that he had drunk
sick and lonesome
  through the lane and past the grave-
yard on to the wind swept benchland
headed south toward the badlands of the
missouri river almost a hundred miles
away with the wind at his back buck
bell drifted his heart was as heavy as
the leaden sky ahead of him rolled a
giant tumbleweed on and on across the
bench grotesque almost alive blown
along by the north wind headed south
  in the pockets of his black chaps was
stowed more money than he had ever
seen or even dreamed of there was not a
chance of the theft being fastened to him
it had been easy almost too easy to seem
true with five thousand dollars a man
could buy a good bunch of cattle down in
new mexico or arizona buck was cow-
man enough to make a herd pay it
would mean that he no longer need work
for wages for forty a month    forty
into five thousand buck was a good
hand at figures one hundred and twenty-
five months ten years and more even if
a man didnt spend a dime for poker or
redeye or smokin-or clothes socks and
such he had sold his bed for twenty
dollars that twenty was in his vest
pocket now he had kept it separated
from the other money-the money he had
stolen
sam bass was born in indiana it was his na-
  tive home   
  the song high pitched quavering
drifted along the wind from behind buck
blurred a little in the flurry of hard snow
that swirled across the ground like white
sand buck halted as the singer came up
out of the storm it was dick powell the
sheriff
something hot scalded buck
bells heart as the rider came
alongside had the sheriff some-
how found him out buck almost hoped
so but powell grinned as easy greeting
he was warmly clad in chaps overshoes
and a buffalo coat the stock of a car-
bine jutted from his saddle scabbard
  you look fer all the world like a bull
thats been whipped outa the herd bell
here see what thisll do to you
  he passed over a quart of whisky they
drank together and rode on with the
storm
  trailin that gent that done the rob-
bery dick
  the sheriff grunted into his fur collar
trailin hell whoever done it didnt
leave a sign but mark my words bell
hell give hisself away
 how
  buck bell slapped his cold hands
against the slicker to beat the blood into
circulation
  here take these the sheriff pulled
a pair of yarn mitts from his pocket i
brung along an extra pair the missus
knit em
  buck pulled on the red mittens mum-
bling his gratitude
  how the sheriff replied to his
question well its thisaway bell i
know every man that was in town that
night i know where each man will be
workin this winter horace gimme their
names and what camps theyd be at i
wired fer the serial number of them sto-
len banknotes when that money begins
goin into circulation ill nab my man
er if ary man quits this range ill be
follerin him ill have the other towns
posted hes corralled
  the sheriff consulted a little book
heres the list stuart and contway
at big warm howe and smith at little
warm you and cotton eye at rocky
point down on the missouri and so on
he shoved the book back into his poc-
ket bucks head was lowered as he
the man who hated himself

fumbled with clumsy hands at a witchs
knot in his horses mane his brain was
working swiftly why had horace lied
why had the wagon boss told the sheriff
that he buck bell was going into a line
camp at rocky point
  i wouldnt be tellin this to everybody
understand continued the sheriff i
know i kin trust you bell
  if the sheriff had taken a sharp knife
and struck the cowpuncher in the back he
could not have hurt buck bell more than
he did when he spoke those words
  they rode on in silence buck was
chilled to the bone by the wind it bit
through his inadequate clothing dick
urged the bottle on him to warm his blood
   i got some stuff thatll be driftin with
the storms this winter bell i spoke to
the old gent about it he said itd be all
right if you boys kinda kept an eye on em
and feed a few if need be
  shore mumbledbuck shore thing
their trails parted a little farther on
the sheriff made buck take his overshoes
and the bottle
  ill be back home in a couple o hours
dont be a damn fool bell so long
good luck old-timer see you next
spring when the chinook melts you outa
the bad lands
  when they had parted buck rode on
the ache in his heart more bitter than
before the words of the sheriffs song
came drifting back out of the storm-the
song of sam bass
       sam he is a corpse and six foot under
   clay
  buck stayed that night at a line camp
and pushed on the next morning he
kept wondering why horace had lied it
hung like a sand burr in his thoughts all
that day he stopped late the next after-
noon at a horse camp and because they
were short handed buck worked there a
week then he drifted on once more
refusing a cent for his labors it was the
ethics of the grub line that forbade his
accepting payment they had given him
and his horse food and shelter he asked
no more though the work had been hard
and he had eaten but two meals each day
breakfast before they rode away supper
when they came in after dark he had
made the biscuits helped with the dishes
and split wood to boot and he had
given them what was left of the whisky
because rocky point lay along his
route to somewhere south he rode
up there one evening at dusk
  a saddled horse was humped in the lee
of the shed hollow eyed cattle bawled
in the corral no smoke came from the
little log cabin filled with grave mis-
givings buck bell stepped into the cabin
the moan of a man in pain came out of its
dark interior he found cotton eye
lying fully clothed in bed his leg broken
between the ankle and knee he had
been like that since the day before he
told buck through set teeth
  horse fell on me cornin up the river
buck built the fire and made the crip-
pled man as comfortable as possible then
he took care of the horses and scattered
hay for the gaunt cattle when he came
back to the cabin he hid his fears under a
careless banter
  ill throw some soup into you cotton
eye and coffee now roll over on your
back and cuss me while i git this boot
cut off ill be as gentle as a cow with
her first calf pardner
  those men of the frontier were steady
of hand and ingenious of brain broken
bones and gunshot wounds were not un-
common a man needed to know the
rudiments of crude surgery in those days
when doctors were few and far between
  there was no sleep for either man that
night buck fashioned a sling to hold the
suffering man while he pulled the frac-
tured bone into place the erstwhile
nighthawk groaned buck swore softly
as he labored he splinted the leg with
stout willow sticks and strips of tanned
rawhide saddle strings beads of sweat
covered the drawn face of cotton eye he
lay back whimpering a little through
clenched teeth sick and faint but game
enough buck held a cup of black coffee
to his mouth

walt coburn
  shes all over but the knittin pard
heres a cigaroot shell hurt like hell fer a
spell but its a clean break and orter heal
fast ill run the show till you git well
id a died if you hadnt come along
buck
 mebbe
  buck built up the fire his chaps with
their precious store of money hung on a
wooden peg with his bridle now and
then he glanced that way his lips smiling
without humor
  you saved my life buck i aint
fergittin
  you better try to sleep feller grunted
buck
  cotton eye lay there a little flushed
with fever his eyes brighter than they
should have been
  i wonder buck if youd be doin this
fer me if you knowed
  knowed what cotton eye
  that money i won off you that deck
was marked
  shore thing nodded buck bell i
knowed that but a mans gotta have
some kinda excitement around a cow
camp even if its playin poker with a
marked deck i was ketchin on to the
markins about the time i went broke
cotton eye was delirious by morning
buck was forced to tie the man down
while he fed and watered the cattle
because there was only one bed buck had
made out with the saddle blankets and
the sick mans overcoat
during the days that followed
buck bell did the work of five
men he chopped wood cooked
and nursed cotton eye whose fever went
down slowly he rode out each day
gathering poor cows that were too weak
to rustle he hooked up the work team
and hauled hay scattering it in a wide
circle outside the corral he opened the
water hole twice a day he puttered
about the cabin fixing it for the long win-
ter and forced a cheerfulness into the chat-
ter that he flung at cotton eye when he
finally crawled into his improvised bed
fully clothed save for hat and boots he
was too weary to mind the cold much
  he killed a beef one evening that
night he brought in a square piece of the
hide and worked on it with his pocket
knife
  lets have that good leg o yourn
pardner buck wrapped the hide about
the leg nodded marked it with his knife
and took the hide back to his seat by the
fire
  them splints kin come off in a day er
so im fixin a sorter casin to fit around
that game laig this hidell be plenty
hard and well lace it savvy padded
with the felt from a mans hat shell make
a cast thatll be useful and right orna-
mental with the hair on the outside im
stretchin it around this wilier pole to
make er smooth
  buck tanned the rest of the hide and
made himself moccasins and a coat that
was ill fitting but warm enough he kil-
led a blacktail buck and they feasted on
venison buck spent his evenings tanning
the hide the rawhide cast smooth and
hard and padded with felt from bucks
hat now replaced the willow splints
buck wore a cap made out of a piece of
hudsons bay blanket he refused the
offer of cotton eyes clothes
  with december came real winter-the
hardest winter the cowmen in montana
have ever known the hay was giving
out buck worked on a snowplow the
cattle in the field grew in number each
day gaunt flanked hollow eyed bawling
as they trained at a stubborn walk with
the storm
  gray days white days bitter days
the cattle drifting down into the bad-
lands even the big native steers were
finding it hard to paw to feed under the
crusted snow
  bucks black chaps no longer banked
his stolen money he had buried the
stuff in a corner of the cow shed wrapped
carefully in his slicker his daylight
labors brought peace of mind but some-
times he lay awake far into the night
haunted by thoughts of the buried wealth
the dream of a cow outfit of his own was
replaced by the black nightmare of his
the man who hated himself

theft he was tempted a hundred times
to share the burden of his guilt with cot-
ton eye who was now hobbling about on
crutches made of forked sticks wrapped
and padded with deerskin
  wish i could git word out to the
ranch said buck this hay aint gonna
last the only shot if this keeps up is to
drift south o the river where the shelter
is better mebbe train out from there
they could buy hay at lewistown and
gilt edge i had to kill three more calves
today cows didnt have milk to feed
the lil beggars hear the cows a-bawlin 
hell aint it
  the haystacks were becoming fewer
buck and his crippled partner found it
hard to fill the long silences that fell over
them cotton eye hobbled about now
getting the meals and washing dishes
he scraped the thick frost from the win-
dow and would sit there smoking and
watching buck bell pitch hay sparingly
to the starving cattle when buck sad-
dled his horse and rode back into the
breaks to bring in more stumbling gaunt
steers and cows cotton eye would curse
with futile fury at his aching leg
  brung in three more o dick powells
steers today weak as hell three-four
circle diamond cows another square
steer one er two bear paw pool strays
and the widder browns jersey milk cow
the widder sets a heap o store by that
cow it must be shore a-stormin up on
the ridges to drift that stuff into the
breaks if this keeps up there wont be a
cow left in the country
  you was sayin something about get-
tin word to the ranch buck i kin make
out to ride now id like to tackle it
aint doin no good here
  if youre plumb sure you kin make it
pardner
  shore thing i kin ill pull out in the
mornin
buck wrapped the injured leg in a
blanket and cotton eye rode away
in the gray dawn buck grinned a
farewell when cotton eye was gone
buck tried to whistle away the gnawing
loneliness he worked feverishly not
even taking a few minutes off at noon
for his usual coffee and beans and meat
now and then when his chores took him
past the corner of the shed where the
stolen money had been buried he would
quicken his pace as a man afraid of
ghosts might pass with haste by a grave
  why did horace lie he asked him-
self a thousand and one times
  because horace knowed who done the
robbery came the still answer out of
each nights darkness
  cotton eye had left his bed and his war-
sack filled with a few clothes and knic-
knacks delving into the sack for a
needle and thread one day a week or so
after cotton eyes departure buck came
upon a large envelope of heavy paper he
emptied its contents of saddle wax and
thread and harness needles and awl he
sat there smiling softly the worried
frown momentarily gone from his fore-
head
  ill do it ill use this envelope to hold
the money else ill be plumb crazy
before spring ill send the money to
horace first man that passes along
  he spent an evening composing a
laborious letter to the circle c wagon
boss that night he slept without tossing
and dreaming and with the first streak
of dawn he was out in the shed with pick
and shovel digging in the corner with
hands that shook with eagerness he undid
the slicker a choking cry broke from his
pulsing throat the money was gone all
of it the slicker held nothing but some
scraps of old newspaper rudely cut and
bundled in imitation of the bank-notes
  for a long time buck squatted there on
the ground staring with dazed eyes at the
slicker and its mocking contents a rack-
ing horrible laugh rattled from his dry
lips then he went on back to the cabin
his brain aching dully with milling
thoughts
  cotton eye had taken the money cot-
ton eye was a thief as well as a crooked
card sharp it was hard to take-after
what hed done fer cotton eye
  well the damn stuff is gone gone

walt coburn
fer keeps too late now to send it back
with that confession    cotton eye
would be headed south by now    south
   with five thousand dollars
  then a slow grin spread across the
mouth of buck bell he chuckled then
laughed until the coffee boiled over and
on to the stove
  thats shore one on me frettin and
stewin around about that money him
playin possum with that leg diggin
er up when i rode off yesterday but
howd he know i had it howd he know
where it was buried well i got all win-
ter to figger er out
days slipped into weeks weeks
of white isolation the hay was
about gone no word from the
ranch and that eternal gray sky over-
head like a shroud
 came that morning when buck bell
looked out at the empty hay corral this
was the end of the trail all about the
cabin the gaunt eyed cattle walked aim-
lessly bawling buck went back into the
cabin and began packing when his grub
was sacked and his bed rolled he went out
to the barn and hooked the team to his
crude snow plow he tied his saddle
horse to the off horse and loaded his bed
and grub on the snow plow then he
scrawled a note and laid it on the raw-
hide covered table weighting it with a
can of frozen tomatoes
  closing the door of the log cabin he
picked up the lines and seated himself on
the snow plow as the team got under
way he grinned back over his shoulder
so long cabin here goes nothin
behind him bawling hungrily trailed
the cattle their dumb faith was pinned
to the man and his horses
  south into the breaks across the frozen
river the sun was a dim white ball in a
dead sky the air was still and sharp
the snow plow creaked and groaned
come on dogies
  a gaunt scarecrow of a man riding his
crazy plow a beard covered his face up
to the frost blackened cheekbones his
clothes were a patchwork of blanket
cowhide and buckskin with the hair on
his hair came to his shoulders under
the deerhide covering his hands and feet
were swollen and stiff from frostbite
sam bass was born in indiana it was his na-
    tive home
  and at the age of seventeen young sam begun
    to roam
  the song blended crazily with the bawl
of starving cattle the creak of his covered
plow runners and the click of hoofs
  south into the sheltering badlands
where the snow was deep but soft the
plow cut through clearing a ten foot path
through the drifts the cattle packed
the trail crowding and riding one another
to get to the precious feed
  grass belly deep cried buck look-
ing back come on you hungry
dogies git the wrinkles outa your
paunches mebbe so its come christ-
mas fer you
 he unhooked the team at last and
watered them at a hole cut in the ice he
camped at the edge of the cleared bottom-
land and his pitch fire sent its crimson
shaft into the night he had found feed
for his cattle there was more to be had
for the plowing he slept that night with
a smile of tired happiness on his bearded
frost cracked lips
  in those days to come buck bell found
a measure of happiness and peace he
labored untiringly a man of rawhide a
bearded frost blackened scarecrow and
the haunting ache of that stolen money
slipped into a forgetfulness buried by the
work he was doing
  he cleared huge patches of grass he
rode back across the river and trailed in
more starving cattle to share his grass
sometimes he came within a mile of the
cabin at rocky point but always he was
too busy to stop those short days were
too brief to waste even a few minutes in
idle pastime the snow was too deep to
tire his horse in breaking useless trail to
the cabin to see whether any one had been
there
  so he did not know that horace had
coma and found that note on the table
the man who hated himself

     hays played out im pullin out if i dont
   die off before the chinook comes ill come in
   and give myself up i taken that money that
   night in town then i lost it so the law kin
   take it outa my hide-bock bell
  a frozen wolf gnawed steer carcass lay
near the cabin its ripped paunch held
no grass only willow sticks some of
them almost the thickness of a mans
wrist
this was the winter of -
when the drift fences and cut cou-
lees held the hide and bones of a
hundred thousand steers when the
mercury hung below forty-five and more
than a few cowboys died for their out-
fits when cowmen stared out across
the blizzard swept hills dry eyed with
aching lumps in their throats grim
silent defeated
   the sun was a white ball inside its circle
of gray cold as the eye of a corpse sun
dogs followed its passing across a sky that
knew no warmth at night the patches
of stars seemed frozen in a black agate sky
  and when the last of the hay was gone
the men sat about the bunkhouse stove
and the strings of staggering bawling
cattle drifted on down the wind to death
  at night the wolves and coyotes flung
the death song toward the glittering stars
  that was the winter of - the
winter that broke the back of the cow
country
  south of the river buck bell watched
the last of the feed go he had lost track
of the days he did not know what month
it was but he knew that the grass had
played out and that the end of the trail
lay just ahead his grub was gone and he
was living on meat and beans each day
he felt of his teeth to test the coming
symptoms of scurvy his clothes were a
mass of patches his eyes were swollen
almost shut the lids scaled from frost the
eyeballs discolored by snow blindness
only half a dozen matches remained in
his pocket he could not remember the
taste of tobacco and coffee
  half frozen he lay in a knot under tarp
and blankets that night in early spring
when a wind roared down out of the
canons with a droning rushing sound
  the scrub pines whispered cattle got
to their feet buck stirred a little under
the tarp hardly awake then the wind
cut down the river and swept his forlorn
camp no man who has ever heard the
voice of the chinook wind can ever forget
its whimper buck threw back the tarp
and the warm blast rushed down upon
him
  a harsh choking cry broke from his
throat as he sat up in bed his arms
ragged aching frost seared flung out
in a wide gesture his face bearded and
scarred black lifted his eyes found the
stars that seemed close overhead in a
warm sky terrible sobs shook him
tears streamed down from his aching
eyes
  god oh god
  over and over again
  god
  he could find no other word to fit into
the prayer that sobbed and rattled and
laughed in his throat
  the weary horses felt the blessing of
that chinook wind the cattle milled and
bawled a restless chant the melting
snow in the tree branches dripped with
increasing cadence a golden moon rode
across the sky toward the jagged skyline
the hard winter was over the chinook
had come its passage through the pines
sang the requiem of cattle and horses and
men that slept beneath the crusted drifts
  and when the coulees became rivers and
the ridges lay bare buck bell trailed his
straggling herd up the ridge and on to the
open prairie
git along little dogies git along
  he sang in a cracked voice as his horse
patiently followed the drags
nd so they found him that day in
- the spring of  horace and the
little man with the white beard
and puckered sky blue eyes who owned
the circle c horace and the old gent
  they did not know him their eyes
were dim with the miracle that lay before

walt coburn
them cattle hundreds of cattle graz-
ing hungrily and behind them a snow
blind man who was all hair and rags who
sang in a crazy voice the words of sam
bass
  a phantom herd followed by a ghost
it was impossible to believe that so many
cattle could have lived while so many
thousands of others had died bucks
herd filled the coulees and covered the
ridges the chain harness rattled on the
work team that was hooked to a bull hide
which held bucks bed and two young
calves hog tied
  a dozen brands were represented in
that gaunt herd one of those calves
belonged to the widow browns jersey
milk cow its father was the prize circle
diamond bull that had strayed down
from its canadian range half of dick
powells herd was there
sam bass was bom in indiana   
  between them the old gent and horace
got buck bell to the ranch somebody
went for doc steele fifty miles away for
buck was blind and one foot so badly
frozen that three toes had to come
off
  hell see agan in ten days said the
doctor let him sleep give him warm
food go slow on the whisky he has a
barb wire constitution and a rawhide car-
cass he was a little puzzled at bucks
delirious babbling
 hes been worrying about some-
thing
  horace and the old gent exchanged
glances the owner of the circle c
thoughtfully stroked his whiskers and
smiled down at the sleeping buck bell
then he handed the doctor the note that
horace had found on the table at the
deserted line camp at rocky point doc
steele knew cowboys he understood he
handed back the note and blew his nose
like a trumpet the old gent fetched
glasses and the bottle
 cotton eye got here about new
years doc he had five thousand dol-
lars and said hed stole it wanted to
plead guilty and take his medicine his
story didnt hold water hed been sitting
in a poker game when the money was
stolen at the depot horace knew buck
was the thief because the melting snow
on bucks hat and clothes showed hed
been out in the storm about the time
that depot man was robbed cotton eye
finally admitted hed stolen the money
from buck buck had kept him awake
nights talking about the robbery in his
sleep like a man gone loco buck saved
cotton eyes life and he wanted to re-
turn the favor
  doc steele chuckled deep down in hiss
muscular throat
  couple of sentimental old sage
hens its a damn shame sir that
we havent more of such outlaws in
this world
  he lifted his glass
  heres to em
  may their breed never die out
when they had set down their glasses
doc steele looked quizzically at the cow-
man
  how is this thing going to be squared
with the mining people
  the sky blue eyes of the old cattleman
twinkled doc steele was somehow re-
minded of the sun shining through sum-
mer rain
  i bought the damn mine doc last
fall i dont think that anything more
need be said about that fool holdup buck
bell saved what cattle i have left god
and buck bell alone know how he man-
aged you should have seen what i saw
the whole range spotted with dead crit-
ters like a boneyard a hundred miles
square wed rode all day across a cow
country graveyard when i heard cattle
bawling i thought i was dreaming that
herd trailing up out of the breaks a
man too weak to walk riding behind
em singing- it was something doc
that a man wont ever forget
  they filled their glasses and drank in
silence then they tiptoed out and buck
bell slept on a smile of peace on his frost
cracked lips
  outside the chinook wind whispered its
promise to the cow country
ghost island

one sunny day in early june
a cowboy dressed in his town
clothes and freshly shaved drove
a jersey cow and her calf to the
widow browns place on the head of
rock creek as he poked along lazing
in his saddle he sang a song that had
to do with the life and death of one
sam bass
  tall grass hid the bleached bones in the
coulees a meadowlark sat on a cotton-
wood limb and filled the warm air with
liquid warbling buck bell now wagon
boss of the circle c roundup rode a-
courting
  in the spring said a poet a young
mans fancy lightly turns to thoughts of
love
 and while buck bell was no mere
youth and this was the spring of  this
cowboy rode his love trail
  lawiee if it aint sukie tears of
joy filled the soft eyes of the ample lady in
the cabin doorway with a big heifer
calf a-follerin and of all people buck
bell light buck and look at your sad-
dle
  about third guard time buck rode
slowly back to the roundup camp down
the creek his head was tilted toward the
stars and he sang with joyful abandon-
sam bass was born in indiana  
ghost island
   by donald a cadzow
on the north shore of st lawrence
island in bering sea are two
eskimo villages called kok-u-lik
and sa-von-ga the doors of the stone
houses in the villages stand open to the
chill north wind from the arctic under-
neath the sagging timbers which once
held up the roofs grinning skeletons look
out at the intruders
  these villages are tabu to the eskimo
now living on the island and are supposed
to be inhabited by ghosts and evil spirits
according to local tradition a terrible sick-
ness came upon the people wiping out the
entire population because they violated
certain unwritten laws of their people
  so much for local tradition which as
a general rule seldom approaches the
truth these two villages of the dead
stand as a monument to a whaling cap-
tain who traded for furs on the side
  in the summer of  a ship put into
st lawrence island to buy furs from the
natives having little else in his hold for
this purpose but whisky the captain pro-
ceeded to get the natives drunk the
taste of rum was new to them and when
the vessel sailed back to the states the
cargo of whisky had been exchanged for
precious skins-the captain chuckling be-
cause of his canny trade
  for days the natives must have re-
mained drunk which caused them to neg-
lect their hunting the caribou and bear
roamed unmolested near the camps and
as the winter drew in they too moved
away to better feeding grounds how it
all ended no one knows for there were no
survivors to tell the story and at least
four hundred people died of starvation in
consequence of the introduction of the
cargo of whisky
empty bottles
    what use had any six foot man
    for an empty one quart bottle
by raymond s spears
a rather large awkward man
shambled into the one way
thru saloon sidled over to the
bar and addressed cock eye
baer the mixer his voice was so low that
cock eye leaned to hear and then asked
for repetition of the nearly voiceless
words
  i want a bottle the man blurted out
  oh yeh the bartender grinned
fatly the question now is gent how
big a bottle
  a quart
  a mans size-and now what liquorll
you have in it
  the familiar patrons were listening
the visitor was plainly modest at least
before beginning his drinks but in buying
by the bottleful he would obtain more
liquor for much less money and there
was a certain aspect which indicated that
the visitor was not quite familiar with the
lingo or the customs of this business place
he had asked for a bottle-not for a
quart of liquor he was a long time
coming to the point too
  why if you please i dont want no
liquor i want an empty bottle
  an empty bottle
  yes sir the awkward fellow said
deprecatorily i want it clean-you
know-no whisky or anything-
  as though whisky ever soiled the in-
sides of a bottle some one exclaimed
sorrowfully
  go in back the bartender lifted

empty bottles

his flat nose lotsa bottles out there
the man went through into the yard
he returned smelling alternately of two
flat quart bottles one white the other
brown they smelled of whisky and he
rinsed them many times finally taking
the white one with him down the street
  the saloon crowd watched him take his
departure
  what dye make of him one asked
snortily
  what he needs is a nipple to go on
that bottle cock eye grinned
  the laughter of the listeners was loud
prolonged and terminated by a serious
round of drinks cock eye was always
good that way he talked brightly and
smartly after several had bought the
bartender served a drink on the house
and then a man came in the front door
the boys gathered around him made
sure he had a drink and then all of them
told him what cock eye had said when a
fellow took an empty bottle out the front
door instead of a full one it was
awfully funny but cock eye had to
elucidate his wit himself because none of
the explainers had exactly the lingo and
tang with which to tell the story
he following afternoon along
butte street cock eye who was
off for the day saw the awkward
fellow coming down the side of the square
shambling the bartender grinned remin-
iscently so that the stranger angled over
und addressed him
  i dont knowf i thanked ye for that
bottle the man said i had to have
it for a baby a lady had downt the camp
you see you fill it full of pretty middlin
warm water an when the kid has the
stomach ache you put the bottle on the
stomach which warms it course you
wrap it in rags
  quite an idea cock eye approved
thas all right but whyd you want it
clean for that
  i didnt know they was going to put
warm water in it i thought it was for
feedin or something
   taint your lady had the baby
  no sir taint theres a sickly feller
there the husband i expect an old
woman come over to my wagon about a
bottle so i come up an got it im
just lookin around myself
  cock eye went on his way he rolled
in his mind this new opportunity by
the time night had come and he was in
his white apron behind the bar he was
ready for the boys to come in which
they did in due course
  say he said  member that feller
come in last night to get a bottle-
empty well i metm up the street
today he did want it for a baby
theres a lady had a kid downt the
strollers camp and an old woman sent
him for it sos they could put warm
water into it to warm the babys stomach
when it ached
  say aint that funny you did hit

cock eye spots a feller wants an empty
bottle fr a baby whatd he want a
clean bottle fr anyhow
  he didnt knowt was for a warmer
he thought it was to feed the kid out of
old woman sent him for it he come
here
  thas funny-come here pr an empty
bottle one of the boys laughed les
have a drink
 around the square in boxelder
a the boys told about cock eye
- the empty bottle and the stroller
down at the campground where there
was a lady had a baby the stranger
again came uptown and shambled to the
emporium went to the post office and
headed down the creek to the camp his
arms carrying packages he was pointed
out and people laughed he was the
fellow who asked cock eye for an empty
bottle that was funny he wanted it
to put on a babys stomach too
  who are you the city marshal
pete culder softened his insult to the
stranger by adding if its any of my
business

raymond s spears

the man answered readily enough im

  what hesberns gray eyes squinted
the baby was crying sir they wanted
to put warm water on its stomach count
of the ache
  the city marshal laughed and strolled
on while hesbern watched him wonder-
ingly thereafter in the days that fol-
lowed sometimes one sometimes five or
six inquirers would speak to the stroller
asking him about the empty bottle after
listening to the explanation they would
say
  thats funny
 then they would go on their way
leaving the awkward stranger puzzled
more and more 
one day cock eye waddling on
his short legs and with his rotund
stomach protruding was again
strolling around the square in the after-
noon it chanced that he met hesbern
who greeted him
  say mister the stroller asked
whats there funny about me getting an
empty bottle
  cock eye bristled angrily
who you talkin to he demanded
hesberns gray eyes looked wonderingly
into the mans face steady narrowing
and losing their sparkle in an odd moon
colored opacity
  ten-twelve fellers told me you said
it was funny hesbern answered quietly
i want to know why
  cock eyes face swelled a blotchy
white red and purple
  whats it to ye cock eye cried his
voice rising from a growl into a shrill
hawklike shriek which attracted atten-
tion far and wide
  i got that empty bottle for a baby
with the stomach ache hesbern de-
clared an old woman ast me to sos
they could put it on the kid account of
the lady what had it being in bed an
her man sickly i dont see nothin

arm

saturday night in boxelder was an
occasion boisterous and full of life
music from crowded dance halls
whoops from exuberant men the rustling
of an active throng filled the community
around court house square with jubilee
just after ten oclock when an unusual
throng had come in due to cattle droving
exigencies with nesters homesteaders
and bad land scatterers all at hand an
agile little fellow with a face pointed like
a rats dashed iijto the one way thru
saloon and stooping low hissed to cock
eye baer for attention

  cock eye ran his hand under the bar
where he had a long barreled  revolver
and made sure that there were loads in it
a minute later another man came in
leaning over and whispering to the bar-
tender
  look out cock eye that stroller
bought two quarts to the claybank-
  aw right sam im ready
  then two men came in from the alley
hurrying

  the bartender swallowed obviously
his beady little eyes rolling in their fat
sockets he took a couple of slugs him-
self he needed a bracer he was a
humorist not a fighting man at the
same time he wasnt deficient when it
came to a showdown hed bashed in a
mans skull served as a bouncer innumer-
able times and had come clear on the
charge of shooting dingo washington in
self-defense he wouldnt back down in
face of necessity he hung up his apron
and the proprietor of the one way thru
quietly took the bartenders place spelling
him
  grimly looking neither to right nor
left cock eye baer sallied forth into the
darkness of the alleys no one followed
him men sauntered casually out into
the gloom and stood listening then
they heard two shots almost together
but none could tell by the echoes from
blank walls and bad land bluffs just
whence came the sounds
in a few minutes the one way thru
saloon was crowded to overflowing
every one waiting expectantly cock
eye baer did not return in ten minutes
nor in half an hour in an hour or two
men went scouting cautiously around in
the alleys but it was dawn before any
one learned anything of importance then
on the shortcut path down to the strollers
camp ground city marshal pete culder
found cock eye lying dead with a bullet
buried in his thick chest driven in the
direction of his heart in cock eyes
hand held in rigor mortis was his heavy

raymond s spears
revolver with one bullet gone from its
cylinder
  doggone i knowed that hesberns
bad culder gasped ill go down to
find im f i can
  he hurried to the strollers camp-
ground where the strangers usually
stopped he saw hesberns wagon and
his two heavy draft horses staked in the
grass on the creek bottom but hesberns
saddlehorse a beauty was nowhere in
sight
  the city marshal went over to the outfit
where the strangers had been delayed by
a baby and by the sickness of a man
  wheres hesbern the city marshal
demanded of the weak but convalescent
man
  why marshal- the man shook his
head-i dont know las night my
wifes mother broke a bottle we had to

  city marshal culder returned to boxel-
der court house square he told the
sheriff coroner and prosecutor what he
knew they had a jury sit over cock
eye baers remains and they rather side-
stepped the question of who why and
whence the killing that night in the
one way thru saloon the boys gathered
sorrowfully along the bar staring at cock
eyes apron spotted large and limp
hanging right where cock eye himself
had hung it just the other night

during the great retreat from
mons in the first stage of the
great war the commander of
the dublin sabers received orders to
attack the enemy at once and check if
possible the impetuous german onslaught
until the guns of the british artillery
could be withdrawn
  it was the first instance in the war
where cavalry was used for direct attack
before that it had been used only for
scout duty
  sir john english the commander of the
dublin sabers called into counsel the
troop captains and laid down the law to
them he was a little fat squire from
yorkshire and knew nothing about the
game of war except to obey orders
  there must be nowavering he told the
troop captains no retreat the attack
must be rushed through to the finish
he completed his stern instructions by
quoting napoleon-
  the guard dies but never surrenders
  after a moment he added
  i will lead the first troop the others
will follow in echelon
  the troop captains all fresh faced
young irishmen saluted and answered
we understand sir it is an attack to
the finish
  then one fair haired officer bolder than
the rest protested-
  pardon me sir we can not spare you
out in front
  to hell with regulations the colonel
exploded i dont push my men from
the rear i get up front and pull them
he understood the tremendous impor-
tance of stopping the german advance
if only for an hour
    so the little fat colonel from yorkshire
  who knew nothing about war mounted
  his big black charger the dublin sabers
  settled into their saddles and the historic
  charge began
   it was a memorable charge three
 hundred yards from the enemy line the
 fat little colonel toppled from his horse
 the regiment swept on slashing and
 shooting their way through two regiments
 of bavarians in spite of the murderous
 machine gun fire
    turning they slashed and shot their
  way back pausing to pick up their
  wounded
    the regiment went up six hundred and
  sixty strong it rode back with two
  hundred and twenty-one men
    but the enemy advance was checked
  the r f a saved its guns
    searching for the fat little colonel be-
  cause they would not leave the field
  without him they found him beside the
  fallen black charger and the one re-
  maining troop captain carried him on his
  pommel into the lines there he was laid
  out with his saber beside him and the two
  hundred and twenty-one men of his
  broken regiment passed through the tent
  to take their last view of him
    some of them merely touched his hands
  others stooped to kiss his forehead a
  few knelt for a moment and sent up
  a silent prayer for the repose of his
  soul
    all of which was somewhat strange be-
  cause the troopers were south ireland
  men and the colonel was church of
  england-a game little yorkshire gentle-
  man who knew nothing about war except
  how to die

thraldom
of
singan
prologue
it may be no particular consolation
to a man who is down and out to
reflect that he has no one to blame
but himself though its a sure
thing he will blame the world
  charles cartwright confined his abuse
to that particular part of the globe that
lies between suez and yokohama and
thereafter accepted the occasion with the
philosophy of a young man who takes
things as they come it was not the first
time in his life that he had found himself
out of a job with his capital reduced to
one dollar mex and no immediate
prospects
  seated on the singapore waterfront
contemplating the lights of the ships at
anchor in the roads and the tropic star-
light mirrored on the black oily water of
the harbor north of blakan mati island
he reviewed with neither embitterment
intolerance nor any degree of satisfaction
his thirty-one years of adventurous mis-
spent life
  during the ten years he had been in the
east he had tried his hand at rubber
planting tin mining and brokering and
now he looked as if he were becoming a
beachcomber
  to attempt to find excuses for himself
would amount to a kind of moral coward-
ice-and cartwright was not that sort

a novelette
of the
malay peninsula
by charles gilson
he preferred to look facts in the face
the ordinary poor devil who went under
in the tropics was either an inveterate
gambler or an unreformed drunkard and
he was neither just a first class special
fool-one of those people who possess
what may be called a genius for irrespon-
sibility who work and live drink laugh
and make love with never a thought for
the morrow
  of a sudden his introspective medi-
tations were disturbed by something very
like a broken sob for a moment he was
startled for he had believed himself to be
alone the seat upon which he sat on the
palm shaded praya was backed by a
clump of shrubs and he had not noticed
that on the other side of these shrubs
was another and a similar seat the one
faced the shipping and the sea the other
the deserted cricket ground beyond which
were the lighted windows of the singapore
hotels clubs and cafes from the hotel de
leurope to raffles
 now there are men-god save the
mark-who speak like women and women
with the voices of men but there was
never a man and a woman who wept alike
this was a womans sob and though soft
it was pitched on a plaintive vibrant note
which made cartwright sit bolt upright
and forget for the moment his own worries
and troubles
  a woman undoubtedly and if so a


charles gilson
tamil or malay tamil women wept for
nothing though their oily unfaithful
talkative husbands usually took good
care they had something to cry about he
hated tamils as much as he liked
malays but he knew how to handle their
womenfolk indeed life on a jungle
estate consisted as much of settling family
disputes as tapping rubber or weeding
lalang
  he would put her right in two shakes
tell her to send her husband to the devil
and hit the other lady over the head with
the empty gin bottle that had doubtless
started the trouble it would give him
something to do and besides when
youre at the end of your tether its en-
couraging to be told-even by a long-
haired weeping asiatic black as sin and
all grease except her earrings-that you
are her father and mother that the light
of your countenance eclipses the sun
  he got to his feet stepped off the
paved esplanade on to the stiff kiss
grass under a travelers palm and beheld
-the woman of his life
a white woman indeed the face
that looked up at him in startled
- surprise was the whitest face that
he had ever seen for it caught the moon-
light and the lights from the street lamps
opposite and it was powdered
  black eyes and scarlet lips and a
coloured shawl that half concealed a
short skirted evening dress that sparkled
a slim little woman beautiful graceful
dejected wearing silly satin shoes for the
dewy grass her black hair shingled--and
that white powdered face
  i beg your pardon he stammered
i thought perhaps i might be of some
assistance
  as he felt an unutterable fool there was
nothing either presumptuous or insinuat-
ing in the tones of his voice
  she just stared at him as for cart-
wright he felt he had to explain things to
find out who she was what she was doing
there it occurred to him that he had
seen pictures like her but never anything
real
  you see he went on i heard you
and i thought you were crying i ex-
pected to find a native woman and being
darned miserable myself i thought i
might be able to put her right theyre
rather like children you know
  with this illuminating statement he
came to a full stop observing that she had
not yet taken her eyes from him
  you speak french she asked with a
slightly foreign accent
  im wise enough not to try said he
my vocabulary consists of tamil
malay a choice collection of chinese
swear words and a few latin tags for
example facilis descensus averno-highly
applicable to myself at the present time
if as you say you are in trouble she
observed you are able to make light of
it that is not so with me
  im sorry he answered but its
not much good worrying as often as not
it only makes matters worse
  what can be worse she asked with
such spirit as to be almost vehement
than to be tied to a man you fear and a
life you hate to see the father you love
being slowly poisoned in both body and
mind to know that there can never be any
release except through death itself
 a startling announcement for a
powdered lady in an evening dress on the
pray a in singapore
  youre in a worse way than i said he
im only stone broke-out of a job
  she regarded him critically but with
marked approval she beheld a good
looking young hercules in the crumpled
suit of white ducks the open collar of
both shirt and coat displayed a bare
muscular neck a somewhat battered solar
topee perched well on the back of his
head he stood awkwardly in front of
her with legs parted a fist in one of his
trouser pockets grasping his only dollar
  she gave a little shrug of the shoulders
and drew her shawl closer around her slim
little body
i do not know why i should tell you
about my private affairs she said im
afraid you caught me in a weak moment
though ive not the remotest idea
the thraldom of singan

who you are said he you may depend
upon it you can trust me if i can do
anything to help you i will
  she ignored the suggestion opening a
handbag that lay upon the seat beside her
she took out a small gold cigaret case and
lit a cigaret cartwright remained stand-
ing interested almost fascinated and
yet for some reason or other nervous
  it does one good to talk she re-
marked tell me about yourself you
ought not to be out of work you are a
young man you are very strong and you
are well educated
  i daresay said he thats why i
ought to be ashamed of myself and i
suppose i am
  you have some business she asked
a planter at least ive done more of
that than anything else i lost my last
job because i was under a manager who
was a scoundrel and i was indiscreet
enough to tell him so before i knocked
him out so i cant exactly ask that firm
for a letter of recommendation
  she sat thinking a moment smoking
her cigaret gazing at the passing rick-
shaws under the street lamps beyond the
cricket ground her next remark was
surprising	t
  that would make no difference she
said as if speaking to herself my hus-
band does not want references he has
come to singapore to find the right man
and i think you may be he
  he stared at her in astonishment
  you dont mean to tell me youve got
a job for an out-of-work planter he
asked ive had ten years of it off and
on i ought to know something about it
ive worked in perak selangor and
johore which state have- you come
from ive never seen you before im
dead sure of that
  i do not live in the malay states at
all she answered i come from the
island of singan
  never heard of it said he
  that is possible she replied
singan is between borneo and celebes
in the macassar straits
  dutch he asked
  it belongs to the sultan of singan
she answered listen i think i can ar-
range this provided you understand that
it will be no ordinary work you may be
asked to do many things that i do not
think you will like doing still that is
better than starving i give you one
word of warning there are no police
courts in singan there is no mercy there
no justice no law but jungle law which
means the strongest wins
  charles cartwright never thought twice
about it if this little powdered woman
who would have looked more at home in a
limousine on the champs elysees had re-
turned to civilization from some unheard
of savage island then he was going there
too if he got the chance
  in his heart he knew he was a fool he
was asking for trouble it was a blind
bargain but never in his life had he seen
such an appealing look in the eyes of any
woman
  i would give a lot said he to get
out of the malay states
  then do as i say she told him
you know the cafe riche my husband
will be there for an apertif at eleven to-
morrow morning he is very tall-taller
than you-he has a black moustache and
wears a large emerald ring get into
conversation with him tell him who you
are and he will engage you naturally
you will not say that you have talked to
me au revoir
  with that she was off across the wet
grass in her satin shoes and from that
moment charles cartwright went out of
the world for fourteen months and when
he turned up at the nolak estate on the
yalai river he looked like a man who had
just come out of hell
chapter i
on the yalai river
the little flat bottomed tin
kettle of a paddle-boat was called
la chauve-souris and there were
only three passengers on board because
there was no accommodation for more

charles gilson
and because nolak was just about the last
place on earth where any one would want
to go
  of these three john eade wool mer-
chant of new york and melbourne was
one and of the other two the first was a
little french lady and the second a fat
man short of both sight and breath who
could never have been anything else but a
german
  in the offices of an old established firm
of new york solicitors it had been sug-
gested that eade should go himself to
malaya in search of a more or less dis-
reputable younger cousin who having
inherited a moderate fortune for the
third time in his life was nowhere to
be found
  from certain rubber estates in both
perak and johore a tin dredging company
in singora from even a poste-restante ad-
dress in pulo penang it was not possible
to learn anything of charles cart-
wrights whereabouts he was believed
to have left the malay peninsula alto-
gether since he had been neither seen nor
heard of for months
  eade who had undertaken to find the
young reprobate if he could was per-
sonally interested in thewinding up of
a maiden auntsestate and as he was
going to melbourne in any case had de-
cided to take in singapore en route
  there had never been any real harm in
charles eade remembered him well as
a boy at college strong good looking
and a fine athlete cartwright had suffered
perhaps from overpopularity he had al-
ways been too ready to make both friends
and enemies a rowdy young devil he
had never cared two straws whether he
spent his money or used his fists-the very
type to prefer a precarious happy-go-
lucky existence knocking around the
world to anything in the way of a con-
ventional settled life
  and from all accounts he had made
things hum in the malay states before he
had had a free fight with his boss on the
sunchor rubber estate in perak a day
or so after that incident charles had put
in an appearance at ikeys bar in sing-
apore where he had stood drinks all
round and that was the last that had
been heard of him suddenly and un-
accountably he had just disappeared as
men sometimes do in the east
eade was inclined to believe that
his cousin was dead in any case
he very much doubted whether he
would ever get any news of him and
then the very day he arrived in singapore
he heard that the missing man was alive
charles had turned up about a week
before looking pale and haggard as if he
had been having a thin time of it
  no one could say where he had been or
what he had been doing for once in his
life he kept his business to himself
though all his friends remarked that he
looked an altered man anyway with
his usual luck he dropped straight on to a
new job for knowing nothing of his
aunts death he believed that he hadnt
a dollar in the world nolak wasnt the
sort of place any one would choose but
cartwright who was admitted to be one
of the best men with natives in the
country had been glad enough to take the
first chance that offered
  as for eade having come a good two
thousand miles out of his way he thought
he might as well see the business through
his cousin had gone up-country to one of
the most inaccessible places in all malaya
but in raffles hotel he ran across a
german rubber expert of the name of
gottheimer who had got a passage to
nolak on the yalai on board a kind of
tramp paddle-boat that was owned and
skippered by a portuguese this port-
uguese a feriiao quental had been
pottering about the islands for years and
had long been suspected of having a per-
sonal interest in the smuggling carried on
by the chinese and japanese he was an
ugly little fellow this quental with a
parchment colored face and no hair as
proud of the glorified ferryboat he owned
as if it were a man-o-war
  gottheimer and eade went aboard at
midday and an hour or so afterward the
lady herself turned up she had evidently
the thraldom of singan

met quental before for she took the
portuguese by an arm and marched him
straight off to the poop apparently to be
out of earshot of both eade and the
german
  there the two talked for some time
quental gesticulating excitedly then he
suddenly ordered his lascar serang to pipe
his odds and ends of a crew on deck
scrambled up to the bridge and got the
packet under way
  that was something of a surprise to
both eade and the worthy gottheimer
for quental had just sworn by all the
saints he didnt believe in that he
couldnt weigh anchor until nearly sun-
down to clear the roads before dark
  eade didnt much mind so far as he
could see they could do no worse than
run aground he supposed he would get
to nolak somehow and that there he
would find his cousin charles what
more immediately interested him was the
lady passenger who hadnt come out of
her cabin all day long from the glimpse
he hadgot of her when she had come
tripping up the gangway john l eade
had more than liked the looks of her
  fascinating little bit of goods and none
the less so because he had never expected
to come across anything at all like her in
the heart of a tropic forest from the
captain he had found out her name and
that she was either married or a widow-
found out just enough to make him in-
quisitive but apart from her prettiness
there was the attraction of a mystery
about her since for some reason or other
the little portuguese was risking the
safety of his ship on her account
  eade sounded gottheimer who had
been up the river before and who had
spent the entire day in a deck chair
smoking cheroots cursing the climate and
drinking beer
  there would be dinner at six-thirty he
declared at which quental would act as
host the chauve-souris was a hell-boat
because there was no ice on board
nolak was a fever trap at the back of
beyond and were it not for rubber would
have been forgotten long since by gott
and never by man discovered the lady
passenger at dinner might appear-he
could not say in the east he didnt take
any particular interest in white girls he
preferred japanese javanese or burmese
  herr gottheimer enlivened by pale
india ale expressed his views with more
conviction than delicacy as he had
never heard of any one attempting to go
up the yalai by night he would be sur-
prised if before morning they were not
shipwrecked and eaten by crocodiles
and in any case he repeated the chauve-
souris was a hell-boat and the yalai an
earthly styx
  eade who had no use for this sort of
thing strolled toward the little saloon
which lay aft across a shallow well-deck
between the engine room and the poop
it was rapidly growing dark-the
swift sunset of the tropics what
could be seen of the sky above the
treetops was a blurred streak of reddish
brown and the air alive with insects
was like a wet blanket heavy and
suffocating
  eade entered the saloon where a lamp
was burning and a chinese boy was lay-
ing the table for dinner in which task
he was being helped by the lady passenger
herself
  she was dressed in a japanese kimono
and in that light eade thought she
looked even prettier than before she was
talking to the boy in chinese and as the
tablecloth was not as clean as it might
have been she was insisting upon having
another one when eade walked into the
saloon she looked up and smiled
  this is how men keep house she ob-
served with her fascinating french
accent and just the suspicion of a lisp
were it not for women i think you
would all become savages again
  eade liked the way she said that quite
apart from the fact that he thought there
might be some truth in it
  at any rate he answered we can
appreciate the niceties of life if some-
times we dont bother about them can i
be of any assistance

charles gilson
  everything is finished she declared
the boy understands dinner will be
ready in five minutes it is already late
and i have not yet dressed
  that knocked the courtier out of john
eade wool merchant in a tramp
paddle-boat on an out-of-the-way malay
river when they might run aground at
any moment she proposed to dress for
dinner he wondered whether he could
rake out something in the way of a black
tie and dinner clothes as he had only
five minutes to spare he would have to be
quick
  he dived into his cabin hurled the con-
tents of his box all over the place and was
struggling into a stiff collar when the
chinese steward let fly at a gong as if he
were scaring devils a few minutes later
eade turned up in the saloon to find herr
gottheimer and madame scala dining
tete-a-tete the captain not having ven-
tured to leave the bridge
  madame might have been in a restau-
rant on the rue royale she bowed her
approval of the americans compliment
to herself and gottheimer who was wear-
ing a much creased pongee suit expressed
his disgust by a succession of grunts into
his soup plate
  the meal passed pleasantly enough for
eade madame who was as charming as
she looked had plenty to say for herself
from time to time gottheimer who sat
opposite her gazed at her in a bovine
manner over the top of his spectacles and
then went on with his food
  so charles cartwright is your cousin
she observed after it had taken her about
five minutes to find out all about eade
  why do you know him he ex-
claimed
  of course she laughed a little nerv-
ously he thought we are-friends in
fact i go to nolak especially to see him
  eade inwardly cursed his cousin and
then did some rapid thinking
  and whats the hurry he asked
  she half turned toward him and looked
him straight in the face
  is there a hurry she asked i do
not understand
  i certainly thought there might be
something urgent he stammered the
little dago captain gave out that he sure
couldnt navigate this river in the dark
i	though it was you who made him change
his mind
  she laughed again at that though a
good deal of her self-assurance seemed to
have deserted her
  that should be my privilege she
said but quental is no fool he knows
his business you may be sure we shall
reach nolak soon after midnight
  im glad to hear it said the other
herr gottheimer had doubts about it
just now
  he had hoped to draw the german into
the conversation but the worthy gott-
heimer wasnt taking any he looked up
grunted and then went on cutting a pine-
apple
 suddenly madame scala touched
eade upon an arm
  tell me she said when we get to
nolak you will sleep on board
  sure said he time enough to
look up my cousin in the morning
a moment after complaining of
the heat she suggested that they
should go on deck
  and then and there outside the door
of the saloon she admitted that she had
not told him the truth
  fernao quental just does what i tell
him she observed charles cart-
wrights life is worth a great deal more
than the little chauve-souris but i
would not admit that in front of herr
gottheimer who did not seem to approve
of me
  she led the way up the steps to the poop
where there was an iron seat clamped to
the deck here she sat down inviting
eade to join her
  there is plenty of room she said
and it is cooler here
  the last of the daylight still lingered in
the west-a dull burning streak above the
treetops of the jungle the flickering
light of a hurricane-lamp fell upon a small
boat immediately in front of them sus-
the thraldom of singan

pended from davits they could see
nothing else the chauve-souris was
traveling at less than half speed her
engines rattling like a hundred tin cans
being dragged over stony ground she
seemed to be gliding through the darkness
as a man swims under water
  madame had given john eade some-
thing to think about this little
powdered lady to all intents and pur-
poses was master of the ship so his
cousins life was in danger and she was
going to nolak especially to see charles
looked like a love affair eade was as
curious as ever
  and whats up with charles he
asked from all accounts he has been
lost for months where has he been to
and who wants to do him in
  i can not tell you she answered
perhaps you will be told everything
when we reach our destination
  if we ever do said eade
  of course we shall get there she
laughed little quental is himself on
the bridge and he can see in the dark like
a wild cat he is used to it
  and gottheimer says we havent a
dogs chance said the american
theres no moon until late at night he
thinks well run aground before that
and if we do it looks like a bad business
for cousin charles eh
  i tell you she said emphatically
quental can see in the dark he has run
this ship into worse rivers than this be-
fore now and with no lights indeed at
one time that was his business i tell you
that in confidence
  all the same insisted eade if my
cousins lifes actually in danger as you
say it will be a serious thing if we do
come to grief
  there is a boat she said i expect
you know how to row and herr gott-
heimer too if he wishes we can not
be many miles from nolak as it is
  if i know anything of discipline on
board a packet like this suggested the
american theres likely to be a panic
about nothing its ten to one therere
no oars in the boat
  he could just see enough of her white
face in the lantern light to realize that at
last he had struck home she looked
genuinely alarmed and there was a little
catch in her breath
  that is perhaps possible she ad-
mitted could you manage to see if
everything is all right it would be so
terrible if i do not get to nolak tonight
  there should be no great difficulty
about that said eade i can catch
hold of the gunwale of the boat and
climb up the rails but i shall want the
lantern its dark as pitch
  he unhooked the lantern which was
suspended at the end of a little deck
storehouse-the worst place in the world
in which to keep provisions in a tropical
country eade who was a tall man
had no need to climb to the top of the
taffrails to look into the boat but no
sooner had he done so than he sprang
backward to the deck while something
that might have been a human panther
alighted almost noiselessly by the side of
him
it took him a moment to recover
both his surprise and his balance for
wearing patent leather shoes he had
nearly slipped and fallen and then he
was aware of the fact that a man was
standing in front of him but a few inches
away-a man who had been hiding in the
boat
  who the hell are you he cried
raising the lantern which had fortunately
kept alight
  he stepped back at once-a short
quick step-and clenched his fist the
light had disclosed a tall good looking
chinese with the pale lemon colored face
of the cantonese very black eyes and a
high though slightly receding forehead
he was wearing a pair of white duck
trousers and a flannel shirt completely
open in front disclosing smooth shining
skin
  the chinese made no attempt to
answer he glanced rapidly with the
look of a hunted thing from eade to
madame scala and then for a moment

charles gilson
seemed to consider the advisability of
jumping overboard from the lady there
came a shriek not loud but half sup-
pressed and tremulous which however
suggested the utmost dismay
  mon dieul she cried liu tang
le diable oh que faire
  at that the chinese turned to run
for it and as he did so john eade
flew at him like a dog and caught
him by the throat
chapter ii
the hell-boat
eade soon found out that he had
taken on more than he had bar-
gained for though the chinese
was not as tall as himself and nothing
like so heavy he was a strong man
and slippery as an eel and during
the brief struggle he did his best to
get at a naked knife he carried at his
waist belt
  it was by no means an unfortunate
thing for the american that madame
scalas cry of alarm had the effect of
bringing the little portuguese captain
down from the bridge like a terrier after
a rat eade had put down the hurricane-
lamp and this gave quental all the light
he needed while passing down the deck
the captain had armed himself with a
belaying pin and with this he dealt the
chinese a blow on the head that knocked
him completely out and very nearly
killed him
  eade was glad enough to extricate him-
self with no greater damage done than a
crumpled shirt for quental wild with
excitement and shouting at the top of his
voice in his own language had laid about
him right and left and it was more by
good luck than good management that he
had not floored eade as well
  the american got to his feet shook
himself like a wet dog and then stared at
madame
  she stood in a tense attitude her
hands clasped in front of her her face-
even in that dim light-looking whiter
than ever he could see that she was
trembling as if it were only with the
greatest effort that she was able to con-
trol herself
  and so you know this man he
asked
  she seemed not to have heard the ques-
tion until she gave a little start and
slowly turned to eade
  i might have know it she said as if
speaking to herself liu tang was
certain to have followed me but how
did he come on board
  must have climbed on deck last
night said the other he has been
hiding in that boat for nearly twenty-
four hours under the tarpaulin
  i dont mean that she answered i
can not think how he got to singapore in
time
  then you know where he came from
eade exclaimed
  helasl she sighed i know that-
to my cost
  the chinaman lay upon the deck
stiff and straight as a corpse and there
was a look upon his face that put the
wind up john eade who had no
wish to figure in the malay newspa-
pers as a witness at a trial for man-
slaughter
  he went down upon his knees and
placed an ear to the unconscious mans
heart
  hes alive all right said he with a
sigh of relief but if he hasnt got con-
cussion the fellow must have a skull like
a flatiron what do you propose to do
with him now
  it was to quental that he spoke-
quental who was leaning right forward
with his elbows on his knees staring into
the immobile waxen countenance of the
chinese the expression of the little
portuguese was extraordinary he looked
half frightened and half jubilant and he
was panting like a man who has run a
race his mouth wide open he still held
the belaying pin in his right hand and
seemed to be ready even eager to use it
again should his unfortunate victim
move so much as an inch
the thraldom of singan

the sudden crashing of branches
overhead a kind of roar from the
engine room accompanied by a
squelching noise as the paddleblades
thrashed heavily into thick slimy mud-
and then a shock that shook the boat
from stem to stern and hurled the cap-
tain eade and madame scala to the
deck
 a moment afterward quental was
shouting like a maniac
  my ship he cried finish one
damn serang him i leave on the bridge
and now i am ruined-finish
  at that he lapsed into his own lan-
guage a string of exclamations and oaths
that seemed to eade to be all one inter-
minable word
  the little man seemed to have gone
raving mad he danced upon the deck
he slobbered at the mouth and then
picking up the belaying pin which had
fallen fron his hand he rushed forward as
if he would again strike the unconscious
chinese indeed it is possible he might
have done so had not the american inter-
vened
  it is his fault quental gibbered
getting his words out with difficulty
rolling his eyes this damn liu tang
i	tell you yes 
  then upon a sudden he remembered
that his proper place was on the bridge
that there might yet be a chance of get-
ting the boat clear of the mud into which
all this time she had been ramming her
nose like an old sow at a heap of garbage
still shouting at the top of his voice he
hastened forward leaving his two passen-
gers alone with the senseless man
  and so the worst has happened said
eade as calmly as he could though it
may not have been the captains fault
this madame is what we feared
  she stood motionless biting her painted
lips
  some way must be found she said
perhaps quental will be able to put mat-
ters right he knows i must get to
nolak
  then she brought her right hand to her
left shoulder and eade saw her wince
  you have hurt yourself he ex-
claimed
  a bruise she answered when 
fell i think i hit the end of the iron seat
but that is nothing she went on it
does not matter
  at that moment the worthy german
appeared on deck rolling in his gait
when he had gained the head of the
ladder the light from the lantern caught
his spectacles and made them look like
little headlights
  did i not this bredict he exclaimed
have i not said to dravel by night was
a foolishness and now we are till
kingdom come here stucked in the mud
and my business goes to die hounds
  time enough to think about that
later on said eade madame is hurt
she may even have broken her collar
bone
  gottheimers eyes revolved slowly in
the direction of the little french lady
  der gollar bone he exclaimed
that is der glavicle let me see i was
one time medical student we go to the
saloon where there is better light
  but he had not got half way down ihe
poop steps before he again swelled with
indignation in his own language and
under his breath he went offwith the
lady abusing quental in particular and
the whole portuguese nation in general
eade found himself left alone with
the unconscious chinese he could
hear the captain shouting on the
bridge the engines roaring and straining
the paddle blades lashing and churning
deep into the mud nothing much could
be seen yet eade was conscious that the
branches of trees overhung the deck that
rattans were tangled in the rigging the
atmosphere was foul with the stench of
the mud brought to the surface of the
water
  presently the chinese moved rolled
his head slowly from one side to the other
and then with some difficulty lifted him-
self upon his elbows staring at the
american
  eade knelt down by his side

charles gilson
  can you speak english he asked
  the man nodded
  then perhaps youll answer my ques-
tions now where do you come froiri
and what are you doing on board this
ship you had best speak the truth
  the chineses eyes narrowed into the
merest slits though he never shifted his
gaze he was certainly a handsome fel-
low though far from pleasant looking
he looked as if he had about as much pity
and human sympathy in his composition
as a cobra he replied in almost perfect
english
  i tell you nothing until i know who
you are said he why should i
  youre a cool customer anyway said
eade im a passenger on board this
ship if you want to know-and thats all
you will know you seem to have for-
gotten that youre a stowaway if you
understand what that means
  the other laughed-not as a white man
laughs just a curl of his thin lips and a
kind of snarl
  if i wanted to said he i could take
a first class passage from here to frisco
when i travel i please myself
  eade was getting interested he
wanted to find out more about this ex-
traordinary manwho was certainly no
coolie but a well educated high class
chinese liu tang however knew how
to keep his own counsel and it is open to
question whether eade would have dis-
covered anything more about him that
night even if quental had not then re-
turned to the poop accompanied by his
lascar serang-a gray bearded barefoot
seaman from the malabar coast with a
countenance as brown and wrinkled as a
walnut
  when quental saw that liu tang was
sitting up he stepped back quickly and
let out an oath in a breathless frightened
voice
  liu tang its queets now see he
cried i pay you back yes but you
come aboard my ship without passage
money i put you in irons savvy i
gotta the law my side liu tang hands
up or i shoot you presto
  as he spoke he produced from out of
his coat pocket a huge revolver the big-
gest eade had ever seen in his life
whether or not the little portuguese was
capable of using it to any good effect was
another question for the american ob-
served that quentals hand was trembling
and though his words were brave enough
there had been a distinct quaver in his
voice
  the chinese on the other hand re-
garded the captain with the utmost
scorn in the lamplight his features were
seen to assume a sneer in which there was
as much amusement as contempt at the
same time he did what he was told
though it was only with the greatest
difficulty that he succeeded in holding up
his hands
  drawing himself into an upright posi-
tion still sitting on the deck he swayed
slightly from side to side as if he were
still dizzy quental with his revolver
leveled at liu tang gave orders to the
serang who with the deft hands of a
sailor quickly knotted the two wrists
together after he had lowered both arms
behind the chineses back
  now you queeck march said quen-
tal you gotta get up or i shoot
lock you up in a safe place liu tang i
gotta the law you not forget that i
queeck settle a chinese stowaway you
not do what i say and i punch a hole
right through your stomach savvy
  again eade feared for the china-
mans life for quental was so
obviously frightened that he
might let off the gun by mistake at any
moment for the time being most of
eades sympathy was on the side of the
unfortunate liu tang
  hold hard a bit he intervened
the fellow cant get up guess hes half
asleep still and his head sings like a kettle
if you want to lock the poor devil up i
suppose youre within your rights but
give him a chance captain you cant
hit a man when hes down
  give him chance quental almost
screamed that yellow devil much
the thraldom of singan

chance he give me i gotta him now you
make no mistake mister
  disregarding the portuguese and rea-
lizing that his own life was in no little
danger eade placed his forearms under
the chineses armpits and lifted him
into a standing position and even then
liu tang staggered like a drunken man
though he had eade on one side of him
and the serang upon the other
  they led him to a small cubbyhole
alongside the cooks galley the place
was unlighted and unventilated and half
filled with all sorts of odds and ends such
as coils of rope paint pots and brushes
oilcans brooms and holystones quental
pushed the chinese over the threshold
then slammed the door locked it and put
the key in his pocket then he looked
round at eade and grinned showing
yellow dirty teeth
  gotta him he repeated mister
one good nights work yes
 and what about the ship asked
eade are we here for good will we
want a tug to pull us off or can you
manage it yourself
  the fact that the engines had been
silent for some minutes had made eade
think that perhaps gottheimer was right
and they would never get up to nolak
  quental shrugged his shoulders
  much dark now said he the mast
has fouled the trees mister bimeby
when daylight come i think we got off
the tide up then and that make plenty
difference you trust me mister i
not want lose my ship
  well said the other and are you
going to leave that fellow in there all
night
  more safer place for him said quen-
tal you not know him mister same
like me best thing for you you go to
sleep no one come up this river we
gotta wait
as it was still quite early eade had
- no desire to turn in he went on
to the main deck and lit a cigar
and was there joined after a few minutes
by both madame scala and gottheimer
who announced that there was nothing
the matter with the ladys shoulder be-
yond a severe contusion
  the three talked for a while on general
topics gottheimer becoming almost
amiable and then madame scala de-
clared that she had no intention of sleep-
ing anywhere but on deck as below there
was not a breath of air to breathe in-
deed she had already given orders to the
chinese steward to bring up her mattress
and blankets
  as gottheimer refused to follow her
example saying that he would rather
sleep in an oven than be eaten alive by
mosquitoes-john eade was left in a
predicament he knew that he would
never get a wink of sleep in his cabin
but on the other hand his inexperience
of the east led him to think that he
ought to consider the proprieties
 when madame scala went below to
undress eade decided to make the most
of the few minutes that were left to him
and finish his cigar on the poop whch
being well out toward midstream seemed
to be the coolest part of the ship
  there the hurricane lamp was still
burning where he himself had placed it on
the deck and there too lay the curved
knife that had dropped from liu tangs
hand when quental knocked him down
eade picked up that knife and looked at
it it was a murderous looking weapon
with a long thin blade and sharp as a
razor
  the crew seemed to have turned in
quental had himself disappeared prob-
ably into his cabin eade threw the knife
down the sharp point sticking in the hard
teak boards the ivory handle vibrating
like a tuning fork that made him thank
his stars that he had managed to hang on
to the chinese during their struggle if
liu tang had got a hand free with that
knife it would have been all up with
john eade
  he sat down on the iron seat where he
had sat with madame scala and tried to
think the matter out he wondered who
the devil this liu tang was he had
evidently come on board the chauve-

charles gilson
souris with a definite purpose and the
purpose of a man who carried a weapon
like that was not likely to be philan-
thropic
  anyway both the portuguese captain
and the little french lady knew very well
who he was-though they preferred to
keep their knowledge to themselves
  eade got to his feet and stretched
himself the mosquitoes were singing
about his ears though the smoke of his
cigar kept them at a safe distance well
tomorrow whether or not quental suc-
ceeded in getting the boat off the mud
he would make it his business to find out
everything he could and if they would
tell him nothing he would make in-
quiries at nolak it was more than
likely that his cousin charles cart-
wright would be able to clear things up
  with that reflection and remembering
that the lady proposed to monopolize the
deck for the night he resolved to turn in
and at the foot of the steps on the after-
well deck he came face to face with
madame herself
  she was dressed in pajamas of dark
silk and was smoking a cigaret in a long
holder and in her right hand she carried
an electric torch
  the chinese steward came out of the
darkness behind her like a ghostly shape-
less bundle he was loaded up with a
mattress and blankets and little of him
was visible except the ends of his white
baggy trousers and his soft felt shoes
  youre not afraid of the mosquitoes
eade asked her
  oh no she smiled i am used to
them like human beings they have
their preferences and besides there
comes a time when one is almost im-
mune i have lived in the east too many
years
  she tripped up the few steps that led to
the poop where eade heard her giving
her instructions to the boy as to exactly
where he was to spread her mattress
and then suddenly he remembered the
knife that he had left on the deck he
had noticed that she had nothing on her
feet but a pair of silk bedroom slippers
through which the sharp blade of that
bloodthirsty weapon would slice like a
razor
  look out for that chinamans knife
he cried i left it up there i ought to
have taken it away
  she came to the rails above the well-
deck and looked down at him
  that is all right she laughed i
have found it and put it on the seat
quental tells me that liu tang is safely
under lock and key that is well-well
for us all-and your cousin charles she
added sleep well my good american
you will find it hot in your cabin if you
are wise you also will come on deck
 tell me he asked arent you
frightened to sleep there-almost in the
jungle
  she laughed again
  i do not fear the jungle she said
do not think that i am nervous because
i was afraid of liu tang 
she disappeared and eade
turned and walked amidships un-
der the bridge there was a light in
the captains cabin and looking in
through the porthole which gave upon the
main deck he could see quental stretched
out upon his bunk wearing a suit of very
dirty pajamas uncovered by either
blanket or sheet
  if john eade was going to get at the
truth why not now why shouldnt he
wake the man up and insist upon knowing
why quental had risked his ship why he
had wanted to kill liu tang and who
liu tang was eade was dead sure that
somehow or other his cousin was mixed up
in this affair and besides the portu-
guese was interfering with the liberty of
a citizen of the united states you
couldnt put a patron to great personal in-
convenience and refuse to give a reason
  eade tried the door and found it both
locked and bolted on the inner side
seizing the handle with both hands he
shook it violently using all his strength
hoping that the noise would wake the
sleeper
  then he went back to the porthole and
the thraldom of singan

saw the reason why quental would not
wake up the man lay with his eyes
closed and his mouth wide open for the
first time he noticed a sharp pungent
smell that issued through the porthole
and lying on the floor in front of the
berth he saw an ivory opium pipe upon
a little table at the bedside was a china
bowl in which was a kind of skewer and a
small spirit lamp that was still alight
  guess he thought he wanted some-
thing to calm his nerves said john
eade to himself i thought he was an
opium smoker the moment i saw him
darned fool
  with that reflection he went below
there was no one to be seen on deck
not even a night watch the serang too
had apparently turned in
  he found the heat in his cabin almost
insufferable-a kind of wet heat that
caused a man to perspire though he
never moved a little finger the prox-
imity of the engine room made matters
worse though the atmosphere of the night
itself was like that of a vapor bath
 the cabin porthole was open when
eade undressed he could see nothing
without though he was conscious that the
thickets and undergrowth of the jungle
were tangled and massed against the very
side of the ship he could hear noises
too continuous and to him more or less
inexplicable the ceaseless droning of in-
sects movements in the water the stir-
ring of animals in the tree-tops
  he put out the oil lamp which tended
to make the room even hotter than it was
and for more than an hour tried in vain
to get to sleep the situation was novel
enough to his experience quite apart
from the heat the little ship on which
he found himself was a kind of floating
mystery an opium drugged captain a
little french woman painted fascinating
and playing some deep game of her own
and finally a murderous chinese with
the features of miltons satan and the
manners of a cultured man who had got
on board as a stowaway
  he had made neither head nor tail of
the whole thing when he drifted into a
kind of semi-conscious condition that was
neither sleep nor wakefulness he was
aware that he tossed continually from
one side of his bunk to the other that
oncq or twice he groaned aloud and
probably swore
  there were brief intervals however
when he actually did sleep and from one
of these intermittent dozes he awakened
with a start springing from his berth to
find himself standing trembling in the
middle of the little cabin
  there was a crash in the jungle outside
the porthole a crash followed by a half
smothered guttural exclamation that
might have been an oath he heard bare
feet running lightly swiftly on the deck
above him and then other sounds in
the jungle-the breaking of a rotten
branch a splash in the water and lastly
a momentary flash like some gigantic
will-o-the-wisp
john eade didnt know why he was
trembling he had an idea that
something terrible had happened
which might have seemed terrible only
because it had got mixed up with
something in his dreams-something he
couldnt remember it took him a mo-
ment to realize that he wasnt wholly
awake and then for a few seconds he
was inclined to believe that everything
had been only imagination
  he stood listening and could hear
nothing the jungle was silent now
except for the insects he could hear no
one moving anywhere on board no
sound but the throbbing of the running
engines
  fumbling he found a box of matches
and lit the lamp then he thought that
he had best look over the ship to see if
everything was all right he felt ill at
ease and a breath of air at any rate
would do him good
  hastily putting on a pair of slippers he
left his cabin and passed along the alley-
way by the engine room to the after well-
deck there was a sort of moon now a
blurred light in the sky behind the mist
as soon as his eyes had grown accustomed

charles gilson
to the darkness he could make out the
dark trees of the jungle the hurricane-
lamp was still burning on the poop where
madame scala-he presumed-was
asleep		j
 and then he saw something that
warned him that she couldnt be asleep
from where he stood he could just see the
poop deck upon which two blankets lay
wide apart and well away from the
mattress as if they had been cast hur-
riedly aside
  he was up the steps like a streak of
lightning there was no sign of the little
woman there though he looked every-
where with the help of the lantern and
not only was she gone but liu tangs
knife had also disappeared from where
madame scala had said she had put it-
on the iron seat aft of the deckhouse
 something was wrong-perhaps a
tragedy had taken place he must report
at once to quental even then as he
hurried forard it occurred to him that
the chinese might have escaped
  he came breathless to the captains
cabin in it there was still a light as be-
fore he looked in through the porthole
and there fernao quental lay in much
the same attitude as before his head
had fallen a little further back his mouth
was even more wide open and one of his
arms hung over the edge of the bunk the
hand touching the floor
  drugged senseless oblivious to the
world of sentient things dreaming per-
haps in blissful inconsequence and confu-
sion that much at least was sugges-
ted by the expression on his face-the
lips drawn back upon the teeth lines at
the corners of the eyes he was like a man
who would laugh aloud had laughed not
demanded a certain physical effort that
was beyond him a voluptuary who re-
posed in some garden of armida of his
own conception or who floated upon
wings of down through space like helios
in his golden boat-and there above him
not an inch from his head driven deep
into the woodwork of the cabin was the
gleaming blade of a knife
  eade knew that knife at a glance he
recognized the ivory handle it must
have been hurled through the porthole
with terrific force for the sharp point was
an inch deep in the wood and the blade
had missed quentals skull by the breadth
of a little finger while the mans sub-
conscious self drifted through an under-
world of intangible delights his physical
body had tottered and quavered on the
very brink of the grave
  eade drew back conscious of alarm
unanswerable questions revolving in his
brain like changing colors before the eyes
of a man who has stared at too bright a
light where was madame scala dead
in the river-to be dragged from the mud
by the crocodiles
  he still had the hurricane-lamp that he
had brought with him from the poop
pulling himself together with an effort
he went down the companionway to the
cooks galley to the little cubbyhole in
which he had seen quental lock up the
chinese liu tang
  sure enough the door was open he
hadnt expected anything else the lock
had been picked with a stiff piece of wire
that the chinese had not even troubled
to remove from the keyhole
  for a moment eade stood half dazed
he found it difficult to think somehow
he remembered gottheimers phrase he
had come on board a hell-boat the
steaming heat the surrounding im-
penetrable darkness the very silence
punctuated by spasmodic metallic groan-
ings from the engine room-all served to
foster the illusion he was stranded on
the styx
chapter iii
quental becomes confidential
eades thoughts flew back to
madame scala he remembered
her fear of the chinese her pal-
pable and abject terror when she had
first seen the man who for some time
during that night had been at large on
board the chauve-souris
  if dead or alive she were yet any-
where in the ship she must be found
the thraldom of singan

somehow or other he must wake quental
who was the only man on board who
knew the truth
  in something not far from panic the
american returned to the deck and again
made frantic efforts to break into the
captains cabin failing both in that and
in getting any sign of life out of the
drugged unconscious man though he
shouted through the porthole at the top
of his voice he hastened forard he
walked rapidly without the least effort
though limbs felt heavy as lead-more
or less as a man thinks he walks in a
nightmare when he came to the fore-
castle he groped his way in the darkness
his nostrils offended by every conceivable
smell that ever came out of the east
  quentals crew had been made up of
lascars malays and chinese here were
the composite odors of tar and opium of
rotten fish and ghee of garlic and per-
spiration mingled with human breath
scented with bctelnut
  eade struck his head against an iron
stanchion and then stumbling over a
box saved himself from falling only by
bringing a hand down violently upon a
greasy naked chest
  there was an oath at once the place
was babel eade shouted in english
and although they couldnt understand
him they recognized the language and
it was that alone perhaps that saved
him from a knife
  when a lantern was lit he saw and
recognized the serang to whom he was
able to make himself intelligible since
the lascar boatswain had served on board
a british ship plying between london and
bombay
  come here said he i want you
 the man followed him to the main
deck he heard what had happened
without emotion though he nodded his
head from time to time to let the ameri-
can know that he understood it took
eade a long time to impress upon the
lascar the importance even the necessity
of waking up the captain and that with-
out delay
  with some reluctance the serang went
back to the forecastle to return in less
than a minute carrying an ax and ac-
companied by several inquisitive mem-
bers-of the crew for all that he dared
not break down the door himself but left
that to eade
  one blow was enough to shatter the
lock and splinter the woodwork of the
jamb the noise caused quental to sit up
and half open his eyes when eade
entered the cabin the captain looked at
him with a dazed silly expression
  john eade caught the portuguese by
the shoulders and shook him so violently
that his head rocked backward and for-
ward on a limp scraggy neck rather like
that of a dead fowl
  pull yourself together you darned
fool he cried look at that knife and
realize that youre lucky to be alive
more than that madame scala has
vanished and that chinaman has
escaped
  these three items of stupendous news
took time to filter into quentals drugged
and sluggish brain he stared at the
knife with an inane expression and then
gave a kind of snigger proving thereby
that even yet he failed to realize its
significance
  eade repeated what he had said shout-
ing word for word in the captains ear
quental now sitting up upon his bunk
with his dirty skinny feet upon the floor
  liu tang he exclaimed at last
escaped mister i think you make
joke yes
  he had gone white in the face
  eade seized him by a wrist and dragged
him to his feet
  come and see for yourself said he
youll come to your senses all right
when you get the shock of your life
forcibly he dragged the captain
along the deck of his own ship and
then pushed him stumbling down
the companionway the exercise had the
desired effect quental began to regain
the use of his limbs his memory and his
voice when he saw the open door of the
cubbyhole it was as if he had received a

charles gilson
violent blow in the pit of the stomach
for he gasped and leaned back against the
wall of the alleyway breathing heavily
  he mumbled a few words in his own
language-oaths probably-or invoca-
tions to the saints then he realized that
he would have to be practical that some-
thing would have to be done
  madame he cried you say she
gone
  i left her on the poop said the other
where she said she was going to sleep
she isnt there now and so far as i can
see shes nowhere on board
  quental still leaning against the wall
began to gnaw his fingernails
  liu tang wouldnt kill her he
shivered scala not let him
  at the same time eade could not fail
to detect a want of confidence in his
voice the man was not so much stating
a fact as asking himself a question
suddenly quental flew into a temper
the vital part of him revived straight-
ening himself trembling all over he
stamped with his bare feet like a bad
tempered child
  your fault mister he cried i kill
liu tang if you no stop me now i
gotta pay for it liu tang not miss
anothertime oh mister fernao quen-
tal and dead man-all same thing
savvy
  his rage was snuffed out of him like
a candle and he was on the point of
blubbering when eade again seized him
by the shoulders
  try to be a man he cried or as
near to it as you can get youre in com-
mand of this ship arent you well get
a move on have the boat searched from
stem to stern for all you or i know the
lady may still be somewhere on board
yotf dont even know that that china-
man himself isnt hiding somewhere
that startled quental again but a
moment after he slowly shook his head
half despondent half relieved
  damn sure thing him go he ob-
served liu tang gone into jungle was
madame dressed
  pajamas said eade and silk slip-
pers old gottheimer wasnt far wrong
when he called this thing a hell-boat
  quental climbed up the companionway
sagging at the knees as if all the strength
had gone out of him half pulling himself
up by grasping the brass rail
  on deck he found the serang and gave
him his orders the whole crew was now
on the main deck several with lanterns
with the light on their faces they looked
a strange collection-every cast of counte-
nance the malay states can produce
some evil some fierce many grinning all
curious
during the next five minutes a
systematic search was made from
one end of the paddle-boat to the
other even the engine room was not
neglected and then the serang returned
to the main deck saluted and reported
that no trace of either the lady or the
chinese could be found
  quental looked at eade his jaw
dropped his eyes staring as before his
first thought was for his own safety
  mister said he in a hushed tremu-
lous voice if we not getta the boat off
the mud perhaps liu tang come back
again
  look here said the american its
about time i knew the truth and im
going to get it you knew this liu tang
before ever he came on board this ship
just you tell me where
  in singan said quental hanging his
head
  and wheres that
  island mister said the captain
macassar straits tween celebes and
borneo
  and did madame scala come from
there
  the captain hesitated shifting upon his
feet and again began to bite his finger-
nails
  come on cried the american
speak out did madame scala come
from this place singan i have a sort of
idea she did
  thats right mister quental con-
fessed
the thraldom of singan

  and who is she
  wife of battista scala mister the
daughter of bernard le camus
   is this battista scala still alive
   quental shrugged his shoulders
  may be mister may not be in a
place like singan a man may die any
minute-when there re ver many who
wisha him dead
  and what do all these people do on
an island away out in the macassar
straits
   the captain leered as if to give the sug-
gestion that he was no such fool as his
interrogator thought him
  i know better than to say that said
he i no ask your business mister i
think best i know nothing about what
happen in singan savvy
  eade was silent a moment he had
already found out more than he had ex-
pected and realized the advisability of
not appearing merely inquisitive for a
few moments he considered possibilities
  come tell me he asked did you
ever come across a man in singan of the
name of charles cartwright
   course mister said the other
that man the bottom of all the dam
trouble we gotta him away when
scala want his blood i no go back there
after that i gotta more dam sense
did any one else help cartwright to
escape
  yes madame scala i betta liu
tang come board my ship killa me and
try find cartwright
  at that john eade received some-
thing in the nature of a shock
  do you know he exclaimed that
charles cartwright-who is my cousin-
is up at nolak now
  quental looked up quickly
  so mister said he appearing more
or less unconcerned then he good as
dead man already and then the recol-
lection of his own narrow escape caused
him to shiver thank god i locka my
door he exclaimed lui tang couldnt
get in my cabin i think he gotta very
little time to spare thats why he make
throw the knife through porthole
  and who is this liu tang asked
eade
  he do alia dirty jobs for battista
scala said quental they work to-
gether mister-handa glove as you say
nobody care what they do in singan
  and whos the other man you men-
tioned eade went on with his question-
ing you spoke of a certain bernard
le camus as being madame scalas
father whats his business on this out of
the way island
  quental held up a dirty thumb and
then pointed it downward to the deck
after the manner of a spectator in a
roman amphitheater
  scala gotta le camus just like that
said he yes mister old man can do
nothing they drugga him all time he
smoka opium hes frightened of scala
same like everybody else battista
scala ver handsome ver strong big
man ver fond women-all kinds yes
but he much love his wife and she no
afraid of him i seen that mister plenty
time
  anyway suggested eade looks as
if she has run away from her husband
now
  may be said the other i think
she kinda caught on to this cartwright
he never gotta away from singan
mister if it no been for madame scala
scala savvy that thats why liu tang
come after her and cartwright
eade sighed on the face of things
it looked as if he would never set
on his cousin alive at any rate if
anything could be done to save charles
there was no time to waste it was a dead
sure thing that the chinese had gone
overboard into the jungle
  well captain quental said he
im much obliged to you for your con-
fidence you and i ought to work to-
gether i may tell you that if you can
do anything to save my cousins life youll
not regret it i came out here specially to
find him
  i no think you will said the portu-
guese with a degree of finality that was

charles gilson
not a little disconcerting liu tang
he getta up to nolak all right he
knows this dam country and speak
malay
  theres the boat said eade im
ready to go up the river and can start at
once i can kill two birds with one stone
so to speak-warn my cousin that his
lifes in danger and get whatever help i
can for you
  quental thought for a moment to
some extent he had regained his presence
of mind but he still greatly agitated
never for long could he go without biting
his nails and he kept glancing nervously
from one side to the other as if he sus-
pected that some one might spring at
him at any moment
  you getta upstream in boat mister
i give you two good men to row you
cant miss nolak-only few miles away
as soon as he had given his orders to
the serang he went back to his whining
and reproaches
  i killa that dam chinaman if you not
stop me presto he complained if
you finda your cousin with throat cut
your fault mister
  oh dry up cried eade losing all
patience with the man how long be-
fore daylight if you lose no time in
lowering the boat i might get to nolak
before liu tang at any rate there may
be a chance
  quental shrugged his shoulders
  the boat alia ready mister soons
you are said he i think ver like i
getta the boat off the mud under her own
steam when the tides up
  tell me what you really think asked
eade whats become of madame
looks like shes dead mister if she
try make the alarm liu tang perhaps
killa her and throw body overboard
eade strode into the captains cabin
and using all his strength wrenched the
knife out of the wooden wall
theres no blood on this said he
that make proof nothing said
quental she cry out liu tang catch
hold her throat strangle her presto
easy work-and ver quick
eade shuddered as he went below
to his cabin he had certainly
heard a splash in the water could
that have been madame scalas dead
body he couldnt believe that true-
the little woman to whom he had talked
at dinner but a few hours before who had
rather fascinated him if this was the
east he thanked god he didnt have to
live in the country
 he was sweating profusely as he
scrambled into his clothes before he left
his cabin he took the precaution of put-
ting a small automatic pistol into one of
his pockets and a handful of cartridges
into the other
  five minutes later he was swinging
through the darkness up the river the
silence disturbed only by the sweep of the
oars in the strong hands of two lascar
seamen
  he made no attempt to steer seated
in the stern he held the rudder taut and
left the boat in charge of the two oarsmen
each of whom glanced repeatedly from
side to side whispering directions to one
another there was a moon now
screened by a thick watery mist as the
river narrowed the branches of the tall
tapang trees on both sides almost touched
overhead
 to john eade minutes seemed like
hours with the approach of dawn there
came a cool damp breeze that caused the
foliage in the jungle to rustle-an un-
canny sound because it was indefinite and
yet everywhere the perspiration with
which his shirt was saturated quite sud-
denly became cold and he began to
shiver his teeth chattering and he could
feel his heartbeats racing and his throat
dry as sand
chapter iv
in cartwrights bungalow
he approach of daylight
brought john l eade to the reali-
zation of two very different facts-
the superb beauty of the malay jungle
and the circumstance that he had con-
the thraldom of singan

tracted a chill and strangely enough
the one seemed to be not altogether dis-
connected with the other the very
fact that he knew himself to be feverish
seemed in some way to account for the
exotic scenery the profuse extravagance
and variety of the vegetation here was
something that he had never experienced
in his life before something altogether
different from the american forests or the
australian bush
 the prodigality of nature almost
frightened him looking upward into
the density of the undergrowth almost
from the level of the water he thought
the jungle more amazing even more
savage looking and impenetrable than
when he had seen it from the deck of the
chauve-souris
  there was something not real about it
all something in keeping with his fevered
blood and quickening pulse the two
lascars now looked neither to the right nor
left with short quick strokes they
plied their oars in unison the sweat
dripping from beneath their faded blue
turbans while they muttered rather than
sang a haunting song so monotonous in
its melody and so repetitious in its words
that to eade it was like the persistent
beating of a tomtom
  beyond a sharp almost right-angle
bend the river broadened out to more
than three times its former width and
there upon the left bank was nolak-or
at least enough evidence to prove to eade
that he had reached his destination
  three bamboo jetties projected into
the water between which were clustered
some score of native craft river proas and
canoes as the boat drew nearer two or
three aitap thatched bungalows came into
view standing upon high ground half
cleared of trees about a quarter of a mile
from the river bank one of them stood
out upon the skyline against the red of
dawn with its floor raised about six feet
above the ground supported upon strong
poles it looked like some quaint gigantic
prehistoric insect standing upright upon
stiff jointless legs
  to the left of this was an open clearing
across which ran a broad well made road
of red gravel that ascended another hill-
ock more or less devoid of vegetation
save for a few scattered palm trees be-
neath which were several barrack-like
buildings constructed of wood and also
thatched with palm leaves all exactly
similar in their dimensions and so
arranged that they formed two lateral
streets
  upon the same hillside were scores of
chickens and goats while here and there
among the huts native women and chil-
dren were to be seen the former gossiping
in groups these were women of all ages
dressed in flowing dirty robes that de-
pended from the left shoulder the hair
of many hung down to below their
waists and their skin was black as jet
  on the far side of the clearing imme-
diately facing the jetties was a long low
building that was evidently a factory and
drying shed and not far from this were
one or two smaller and better built
houses that had the unmistakable ap-
pearance of offices beyond the factory
between the two hillocks one could ob-
tain a glimpse of the gently rising ground
that marked a plantation of young rubber
trees where a gang of coolies was to be
seen at work
the lascars ran the boat along-
side the central jetty and then
shipping their oars produced dirty
looking bundles that contained a mixture
of rice and fish which they proceeded to
eat by the primitive method of scooping
it into their mouths with their fingers
they had fulfilled their part of the trans-
action they were no longer concerned
with john eade having infinite respect
for the capacities of the white man whose
ways were not their ways who was in all
things incomprehensible they were not
even curious
  eade climbed out of the boat the
rickety jetty creaking and swaying be-
neath his weight he had not the least
idea where to go but had little doubt that
sooner or later he would come across
some one who could tell him where he

charles gilson
would find charles cartwright or the
manager of the estate
  three or four tamil children playing
with empty coconut shells in a puddle of
mud desisted from their game to stare at
him in awed astonishment a little
farther on he came across a chinese who
could give him no better information
than a no savvy and a look of con-
tempt the offices appeared to be de-
serted until eade entered without knock-
ing a small room in which an indian clerk
dressed in a white duck suit that looked
much too tight for comfort and wearing a
white sun helmet well on the back of his
head was seated writing at a desk
  can you tell me please asked the
american if i shall find a mr charles
cartwright here
  the clerk who was a telegu a hindu
and a person of no little importance in his
own estimation-if in nobodys else-got
to his feet
  an affirmative reply sir he ex-
claimed with a heartiness that almost
took eades breath away mr cart-
wright has the responsible charge of
number two division a considerable
mileage from headquarters even as the
crow flies but i can send out for him
if your esteemed business is at all pre-
cipitous
  he was too concerned with his cousins
safety to note the mans extraordinary
choice of words
  is mr cartwrights bungalow far
from here he asked
  the telegu pointed out of the window
toward the hill downstream upon which
eade had seen the bungalows
  the second of those residences sir
is officially deputed to the assistant
manager responsible for division num-
ber two
  at what time should mr cartwright
have left his bungalow this morning
at a quarter to five sir though of
course some procrastination may have
unavoidably delayed him
  eade thought for a moment his fingers
to his lips
  it would be dark then said he as if
to himself and then to the clerk do
you know for a fact that mr cartwright
did go out to the estate this morning
the telegu stared at him in astonish-
ment his sleepy eyes opening sufficiently
to display white rims of eyeballs at the
same time he leaned forward on the table
and the american noticed his refined al-
most feminine hands the tapering fingers
terminating in lead coloured finger nails
  i see sir you anticipate some bitter
pill the clerk interposed
  sure said the other mr cart-
wright is my cousin ive come out from
the united states to find him and while
on my way up this river i learned that
his life is in very serious danger
  the telegu threw up his hands pal-
pably alarmed
  you dont say so he exclaimed
sir that is almost well nigh inconceiv-
able mr cartwright is so jolly popular
by gosh sir you have indeed hurled a
blue bolt at me
  look here said eade you and i had
better go up to mr cartwrights bunga-
low right now it may startle you to hear
it but theres some reason to fear that
the worst has happened he may have
been murdered during the night
  the clerk flew to the door
  sir i stir my stumps he cried and
then suddenly looking frightened again
he hesitated you have a weapon he
asked
  eade produced his automatic the sight
of which gave the man some confidence
  in an uncivilized vicinity said he
self-defense is a good egg you may take
my word for that sir
on the way up the hill along
the broad red road he plied eade
with questions the american
told the clerk that the boat on which he
had come upriver lay stranded some miles
downstream and that a chinese stowa-
way had gone overboard into the jungle
with the deliberate intention of getting
to nolak to murder cartwright when
he had left the ship the man had cer-
tainly been unarmed but if there were
the thraldom of singan

villages in the jungle he might have got
hold of a malay kris en route
  there is no malay village anywhere
approximate said the telegu farther
back in the hills there are orang benua-
dirty black men sir he added
  the tones of his voice suggested the
utmost contempt and disgust eade re-
garded him with surprised amusement
for the clerks complexion was a rich
chocolate brown
  at the top of the hill the road was over-
hung by palm trees on the right was a
row of four or five bungalows each sur-
rounded by its own garden a lawn of well-
mown kiss grass and formal beds gay
with tropical flowers the veranda of
each bungalow was decorated with orchids
in hanging baskets as well as with various
kinds of trailing plants and ferns
  the telegu halted at the bottom of the
steps of the second bungalow he was
plainly scared there was a kind of leaden
color about his gills and he kept tugging
nervously at his long mustache
  after you sir he bowed pray go
first let us hope theres no fat in the
fish kettle he observed that would
be terrible
 eade was wise enough to take his
automatic from his pocket before he
ascended the steps to the veranda he
had seen enough of liu tang to be pre-
pared to shoot at sight
  the bungalow consisted of but three
rooms-a long oblong room that extended
across the whole front and two smaller
rooms at the back each having doors into
the front room and connecting one with
another the big room was furnished as a
sitting and dining room the chairs being
basketwork of the two rooms at the
back one was charles cartwrights bed-
room and the other a guest room from
which there were steps that descended to
a bathroom below the floor
  while eade searched the place cau-
tiously on tiptoe the telegu waited at
the head of the steps apparently ready to
fly for his life at the first sign of danger
  neither in the sitting room nor in cart-
wrights bedroom was there any sign of
life save scores of lizards upon both the
walls and the canvas ceiling that sagged
under the attap roof but in the other
room he came unexpectedly upon a
chinese coolie seated on an empty pack-
ing case whitening a pair of tennis shoes
who was startled out of his life at the
sight of an armed intruder failing to
make the boy understand a word he said
eade returned to the doorway and man-
aged to persuade the clerk to enter the
telegu came in shivering glancing about
him nervously and with his back to a wall
moving sidewise like a crab
  when he saw the coolie who could not
have been much more than sixteen years
of age he immediately gained confidence
asked him one or two questions in the
dictatorial tones of a schoolmaster and
then interpreted to eade
  he says that no one has come here
since mr cartwright went out he de-
clared that was before daybreak this
morning he says we will fish out cart-
wrights boy from the kitchen the boy
can speak english he will tell you any-
thing you want to know
  following the coolie they went down
the few wooden steps into the bathroom-
a wooden tub in a bare room with a con-
crete floor a water tap protruding from
the wall and shower bath
  from this place there was a small door
that led into the garden across which a
gravel path led straight to the outbuilding
which comprised the servants sleeping
quarters and the kitchen
  here in a semi-dark steaming room
where the air was alive with flies whose
buzzing was almost deafening were two
chinese-a short fat cook and a tall thin
boy or personal servant-as well as
the malay kerboon who should have been
at work in the garden
  as the american had no wish to re-
main in that atmosphere longer than he
had to he asked the boy to step out into
the garden where he received prompt and
intelligent answers in pidgin english to
his questions
  mr cartwright had gone out to his
work as usual that morning at a quarter

charles gilson
to five and would not return to the
bungalow till twelve oclock for tiffin
after he had been called mr cart-
wright had had his chota hazri he never
took very long to dress as he never
shaved until he came home at midday
he always rode a bicycle up to his
division and sometimes when there was
much work to be done his lunch was taken
out to him as mr cartwright had given
no such orders that morning he was
certain to return to the bungalow at
about twelve oclock
  eade gave a sigh of relief if cart-
wright was at work on the estate with a
gang of tamil coolies his life could be in
no immediate danger especially as the
boy informed him that his master in-
variably carried a revolver
he american was in two
minds what to do he might take
a walk along the road to meet
cartwright coming back or he might
remain in the bungalow and await his
cousins arrival he did not feel in the
least disposed to adopt the former course
having had little or no sleep during the
night he was dead tired and besides the
sun was now well up and the heat terrific
on the other hfind it occurred to him
that to wait in the bungalow might in-
volve a certain amount of personal risk
presumably liu tang was still on his way
to nolak through the jungle and might
arrive at any moment
  the circumstance that he still had a
temperature made eade disinclined to
walk even a short distance he felt a kind
of heaviness in his limbs and every joint
in his body ached all he wanted to do
was to fling himself down upon a bed
quench his thirst and drop off to sleep
  on his returning to the bungalow a
cursory inspection of the place at once
suggested a compromise there were but
two entrances to the building-the steps
up to the veranda and the door into the
bathroom the latter could be locked
from the inner side and having done this
eade was careful to put the key in his
pocket as an additional precaution he
lowered the trapdoor which had stood
open at the head of the bathroom steps
in the spare room and assisted by the
chinese boy-to whom he explained the
situation-he moved the chest of drawers
to the top of this
  he had barred that way all right in
military parlance his flanks and rear were
secure the telegu clerk before re-
turning to his office assured him that he
could trust both the chinese boy and the
coolie to keep a sharp look-out on all sides
of the bungalow feeling tolerably safe
eade asked the boy for some quinine
swallowed fifteen grains and then lay
down on one of the long chairs on the
veranda with a big tumbler of well iced
tonic water and his loaded pistol on a
small wickerwork table close at hand
  he had placed himself immediately
facing the steps up which no one could
ascend without being seen at the same
time he realized that he would have to
exercise a certain amount of will power to
keep himself awake there were two or
three shelves of books in the sitting room
but he had no desire to read
john eade lay in that long chair
for more than three hours with
nothing but his thoughts for com-
pany and the lizards of all sizes that
swarmed in the bungalow
  he had plenty to think about the
very fact that if he fell asleep he might
have his throat cut or be shot with his own
gun was enough to keep him awake he
was free to puzzle his brains to his hearts
content to ask himself riddles he knew he
couldnt answer
  the mystery of the island of singan
the extraordinary people who lived there
whom quental had described batista
scala and bernard le camus madame
scalas father and what has happened
to madame herself she had vanished as
suddenly and unaccountably as if she had
been spirited away and why had
charles been obliged to fly for his life
from the island was it jealousy on
scalas part that had made him send liu
tang to the yalai river or was there
the thraldom of singan

some other motive at the back of it
  eade perplexed and baffled reminded
himself that he had but to wait a little
longer he was bound to learn the truth
from charles as soon as his cousin arrived
  suddenly a new fear possessed him
the road to the estate led through the
jungle what if liu tang attacked
charles cartwright on his way home-
lay in wait for him and took him by sur-
prise it was easy enough to knock a
man off a bicycle a stick thrust into the
spokes was enough
  eade called the boy whose name he
had discovered to be ah yen
  is mr cartwright ever late he asked
  always about same time said the
chinese him come few minutes now
i catch his shaving water and then lay
table for tiffin master wantchee me lay
two places he asked
  you may as well said eade though
i dont feel inclined to eat much
  the boy went into the bedroom and in
less than a minute returned so far as a
chineses face can express anything he
appeared to be more concerned than sur-
prised
  master got mr cartwrights razor
he asked
  razor eade exclaimed of course
not why
  no can find said the chinese with a
conclusive shrug of the shoulders
  eade got to his feet
  you had better look for it said he
what kind of a razor is it a safety
razor
  no said the boy mr cartwright
use backward razor all same number one
size pocket knife
  well said eade he had it yester-
day i suppose
  i see it last night dinner time on the
dressing table said the chinese
 member very well master mr
cartwright go out to dinner and i tidy
up look see all belong proper
  eade stared at the boy in astonish-
ment
  youre dead sure you saw this razor
last night he asked
  certain sure master
  and its nowhere in the bungalow
now
  make look see everywhere said the
boy no can find
  eade was silent a moment
  my god he exclaimed half under
his breath then somebody has been
here just before or just after sunrise
  when he tried to think he realized
that owing to a splitting headache it was
as much as he could do to arrive at the
simplest logical deduction if the razor
had been stolen it was more than prob-
able that it had been stolen by liu tang
if charles had been called by his servant
at half past four and had left for the
estate at about a quarter to five then
liu tang must have got to the bungalow
somewhere between the latter hour and
sunrise which would be about six oclock
it looked as if liu tang had taken the
razor that he might use it as an effective
weapon when an opportunity presented
itself
  and if that were so where was liu tang
now he was not in the bungalow-that
was a certainty he must be hiding some-
where in the jungle and there was cer-
tainly a chance that he might intend to
attack cartwright on his way home upon
an unfrequented road
  eades nerves were all on edge he fell
the want of sleep he had a touch of fever
the situation in which he found himself
besides being novel to his experience was
something in the nature of a climax
soft unsteady footsteps upon the
steps that led to the veranda caused
him to swing round in alarm hold-
ing his pistol ready to fire for a second
he was convinced that he was about to
find himself face to face with liu tang
the would-be murderer of his cousin
the footsteps he had heard had been
quick and shuffling-those of one who
has bare feet or who wears light soft
shoes
  he beheld instead a sight that was at
once amazing and pathetic more than
half way up the steps clutching the rail

charles gilson
for support as if to prevent herself from
falling full in the tropic sunlight stood
madame scala
  the brilliant sunshine framed her
slender figure as in gold in a way this
was an apotheosis of the woman he had last
seen on board the chauve-souris when he
had looked up at her from the well-deck
  her face was drawn and haggard even
smeared with blood which had dried upon
the powder on her cheeks her scarlet
lips were drawn back as if she suffered
pain the thin silk pajama suit that she
was wearing had been torn by thorns in
a dozen places and her flimsy shoes were
cat to ribbons
  she looked half savage half martyr
and yet she had lost little of her beauty
there was a wild expression in her eyes
like that of a hunted thing it was evi-
dent that she was so exhausted and so
weak that it was as much as she could do
to stand
  as with a great effort she dragged her-
self up the few remaining steps recog-
nizing eade she came forward tottering
with both hands stretched out in front of
her and what struck john eade as the
most incongruous thing about her was a
gold wrist-watch studded with diamonds
  you here she exclaimed oh
tell me-charles he is safe
  so far as i know said eade but you
madame you must lie down and rest
  he had moved toward her when she
drew back a step and passed a hand
across her eyes
  and liu tang has not come she
asked
  not so far as we know said the
american
  the bon dieu be praised monsieur i
was asleep-you remember where you
left me on the deck i woke up with a
start i do not know why i saw the face
of liu tang-that devils face-quite
close to me-in the moonlight i think i
shrieked and then he fled it took me a
moment to recover myself i heard him
trying to force his way into quentals
cabin i saw him struggling to open the
door but when i came upon the main
deck he saw me and threw the knife
through the cabin porthole is quental
dead she asked suddenly breaking off
  no said eade he missed-by the
fraction of an inch
  she gave a sigh of relief and went on
with her story
  liu tang sprang overboard into the
jungle like a wildcat i knew what he
meant to do-to come here to kill
charles and i know too from whom he
got his orders
  and you went in pursuit of him
eade exclaimed madame you were
mad
  she leaned for support against the back
of the chair in which john eade had
spent the greater part of the morning
  yes monsieur i was mad desperate
she said i did not care what happened
to me i did not wait to think i tried to
jump ashore but one foot went into the
water into the mud i had my electric
torch in my right hand i switched it on
and saw where i was i caught hold of a
bough of a tree pulled myself out of the
water and hurried after liu tang for a
few minutes i could hear him in front of
me breaking his way through the jungle
but soon after i had come to a narrow
path i lost him he is strong that man-
he is like a leopard
  she paused as if she wanted breath
and then tried to draw her silken shreds
of clothing closer about her stooping
sylph-like body eades feelings toward
her were a mixture of bewilderment pity
and admiration his own fears and
troubles were forgotten
  you must rest madame he insisted
you might have killed yourself
  a moment i must tell you all she
went on mile upon mile hour after
hour oh my good friend the never
ending jungle it is awful i did not know
where i was going i just followed the
path and went on and on and on my
torch went out but when daylight came
i could see better and then i met a
malay who told me the way to nolak
from the way he looked at me i could
see that he thought i was mad and
the thraldom of singan

for that reason he was frightened of me
she had spoken in a quick breathless
voice and having finished her story she
closed her eyes for a moment and then
opened them and looked round the
veranda as if she saw everything there
for the first time
  but it is impossible said she that
liu tang is not here he must have
been miles in front of me
  thats true enough said eade if
the man has been here at all it was more
than six hours ago
  then he has come she cried in new
alarm
  madame i know nothing for certain
but to tell you the truth theres evidence
that he may have come and gone
  again she carried her hand to her heart
  i fear for charles she said
  a heavy step on the veranda caused
them both to turn john eade recog-
nized his cousin at once though he had
not seen him for more than twenty years
well over six feet in height clean shaven
fair haired and powerfully built cart-
wright looked younger than his years he
was wearing breeches and puttees a flan-
nel shirt open at the neck and a pith
helmet he stood at the head of the steps
with his legs wide parted he glanced
first at eade and then at the lady
though he had not the remotest idea who
his cousin was he recognized madame
scala at once
  valerie he cried
  she turned quickly gave him one glance
and then closed her eyes
  thank god you are safe she
breathed in a voice little above a whisper
  and had john eade not caught her in
his arms she would have fallen to the
ground
chapter v
news of battista cala
it was as if the life had gone out of
her her powers of endurance had
been taxed to the utmost by sheer
will power alone she had managed to tell
eade the greater part of her story and
nothing but anxiety and suspense had
kept her going until the tension was sud-
denly relieved and she had fallen forward
in a swoon
 when john eade made known his
identity to his cousin cartwright showed
little or no surprise his sole concern
seemed to be for madame scala whom he
took from eades arms and for a moment
stood irresolute as if he didnt know what
to do with her
  ill take her to mrs headley said he
shes certain to be at home now in the
heat of the day headleys our manager
he went on to explain his wifell look
after her theres not a doctor within
ten miles of us
  eade went to the head of the steps and
looked up and down the road he had no
particular object in doing so he merely
felt that he wanted to do something and
could think of nothing that could be in
any way useful just as he could think of
nothing to say
  he saw the red road in the glaring
light-shadowless though it ran like an
avenue between towering trees the
suns rays were vertical the elongated
glaucous leaves of a shrub at the foot of
the veranda steps shone in the glare as if
they were of silver
  not far away leaning against the low
fence that divided the garden of cart-
wrights bungalow from that next door
was a man whose personal appearance was
as unprepossessing as it was singular
had that not been so john eade would
not have looked at him twice instead of
staring at him as he did for the best part
of a minute
  at first he could not decide whether
the man was an asiatic or a european
he was certainly dressed like a white
man in a dust colored suit of crumpled
shantung silk that included even a
waistcoat he wore both a soft collar
and a necktie as well as a white sun-
helmet
 his face however was that of a
mongol for he had chinese eyes-ex-
traordinary big eyes but almond shaped
-beneath which were repulsive looking

charles gilson
blue sacs that made him resemble some
sort of loathsome reptile
  he had also the cadaverous complex-
ion of a corpse high cheek-bones thin
lips half concealed by a straggling and
very thin mustache the few hairs of which
drooped downward to the corners of his
chin
  he did not appear to have anything
definite to do he was smoking a cigaret
in a holder which it appeared to be too
much trouble for him to hold in his teeth
for the thing hung down so far that the
lighted end was in danger of touching the
lapel of his coat both his hands were
thrust deep into his trouser pockets his
whole attitude suggested indolence and
yet eade had not failed to notice that he
was regarding cartwrights bungalow in
a furtive suspicious way
  at that moment charles himself ap-
peared on the steps carrying madame
scala whose slim body he had wrapped
around in a sheet taken from his bed
  come on to headleys he ex-
claimed as he brushed past his bun-
galows not more than half a mile
away
  he was down the steps in no time and
turned to the right upon the road that
took him to within a few feet of the man
who stood loitering between the two
bungalows and no sooner was cartwright
abreast of him than he stopped stone
dead
hat the devil do you want
here he asked savagely
  the man took his cigaret from
his mouth still leaning against a post
he exerted himself to the extent of shifting
his balance from one foot to the other and
removing a hand from his pocket
  you said he he pointed at the
white shapeless object in cartwrights
arms whos that he asked
  mind your own damn business
cried the other with an oath and be
off youre the last man on earth i want
to see at any time and least of all now
with that charles hurried on moving
from the center of the roadway to the
grass at the side under the shade of the
palms and as he walked he hurled
questions over a shoulder to his cousin
who found it was as much as he could do
to keep up with him cartwright was
told the bare facts of what had happened
the discovery of liu tang on board the
chauve-souris the stranding of the
paddle-boat the escape of the chinese
and madame scalas pursuit of him
clad only in pajamas
  by that time they had reached a big
bungalow standing in a well kept and
spacious garden passing up a drive that
formed a semicircle they came suddenly
within sight of th house before the
veranda of which stood a high wheeled
gig with a malay syce holding the ponys
head
  headleys there himself said cart-
wright he tiffins early and then drives
round the estate in the heat of the day
the idea being-from what i know of him
-to cultivate a thirst
  the manager of the nolak estate a
little bald headed fellow who had run to
fat in the east met them on the steps
cartwright hastily explained so much as
he knew of the situation a lady he had
known in singan had tried to find her
way alone to nolak through the jungle
the boat on which she had come up-
river being stranded some way down-
stream she had fainted from exhaustion
but had recovered consciousness before he
left his bungalow all he wanted was to
ask mrs headley to look after her if
necessary some one could be sent to
bukit tirah for the doctor
  headley who looked as mystified as a
man with a cheery almost circular face
can declared that his wife would un-
doubtedly do everything in her power
and no sooner were the words out of his
mouth than cartwright went straight
into the bungalow leaving john eade to
introduce himself
  there followed further interrogations
eade using his discretion as to what ex-
tent to confide in his cousins superior
headley however appeared to be a man
who took life as he found it who had
the thraldom of singan

lived long enough in the east to be sur-
prised at nothing
  looks as if your cousin had got him-
self into a fix he observed were
more or less used to that sort of thing out
here an indian june from one years end
to the other you know and you may
remember that kipling says something or
other about married women and new
pianos however thats not my affair
and i suppose it dont matter a great lot
to you
  he offered eade a drink which the
american accepted according to head-
ley whisky was the one great panacea
for malaria and all the other ills of the
orient whenever he got anything the
matter with him-which was seldom
enough-why he just drank it out
  except that his face was somewhat
colorless and pasty he looked healthy
enough and anyway he was brim full
of vital energy and humor while wait-
ing for his cousin eade availed himself of
the opportunity to tell headley of the
fate of the chauve-souris and to ask if
anything could be done to get the paddle-
boat out of the mud
  weve no tugs here said the man-
ager i know that little packet well and
i dont mind telling you her reputations
none of the best but ill send a message
to quental and if a gang of coolies can
help him they can go down on our
launch
  upon cartwrights return headley
kept the two men nearly half an hour
offering them one drink after another
before he would let them go
when john eade and his cousin
found themselves again upon the
roadway on their way back to
cartwrights bungalow eade acquainted
his cousin of his good luck of the business
that had brought him out to the east
  the old lady has left you a very com-
fortable fortune said he and if youll
take the advice of an old friend this time
youll stick to it
  cartwright seemed to take the news
more or less as a matter of course he
seemed neither elated nor surprised he
looked at eade critically
  yquve altered a lot john since i saw
you last said he i dont think id
have recognized you even if i hadnt had
something else to think about
  and youve changed mighty little
since the old days at college said eade
you look bigger and strong perhaps
but you havent grown out of your boy-
hood yet
  then i dont know how ive man-
aged it cartwright laughed i dont
mind telling you ive been in hell since i
came out here-stone-broke more than
once absolutely down and out john
and ive had some strange experiences
too but tell me more about this business
what brought madame scala and liu
tang up here i havent yet quite got the
hang of it all
  eade again related the whole story this
time in greater detail cartwright
listened with the utmost attention he
never interrupted save for an occasional
exclamation until his cousin came to the
part when the chinese boy had declared
that his masters razor was missing at
that cartwright whistled
  then liu tang was inside my bunga-
low some time this morning said he
looks as if i was lucky
  so far as i can make out said eade
he must have got there between the
time when you left and sunrise had you
been asleep when he got here he would
have murdered you for according to
madame scala thats what he came here
for on the other hand he couldnt have
stolen the razor when it was broad day-
light he could never have got into the
bungalow without being seen by one of
your servants
  that seems rational enough john
have you started business as a private
detective if so you ought to be able to
tell me where liu tang is now
  i dont know that said eade
from what we know it seems probable
that having got hold of your razor hes
hiding somewhere and biding his time
hes not likely to show up until after dark

charles gilson
  good lord cartwright suddenly ex-
claimed i never thought of it before
theres a scoundrel here who was out in
singan with me who would give a lot to
see me under ground of course liu
tang may not know hes here but if that
rascal happens to come across the gentle-
man who calls himself mr eugene pai
well have two of them to tackle instead
of one
  eade glanced at his cousin he had
got a sudden idea that was not alto-
gether reassuring
  what sort of a fellow is that man
he asked
  man repeated cartwright hes
not a man a shanghai sewer rat-half
of him chinese while not even he him-
self knows what the other half is i ex-
pect he thinks eugene sounds better than
yu chin in this place hes running a
store where he sells cheap gin to tamil
coolies and conducts a profitable money
lending business a weeks credit at
twenty per cent i warned him that if i
had any trouble with him id get headley
to clear him out
  thats not the point said eade
is this the man you spoke to when we
left your bungalow the chap you told to
clear out and mind his own business
sure said charles i wonder what
the fellow was doing hanging around
there he may have seen madame scala
come in and thats why he wanted to
talk to me john this looks like trouble
  as he was speaking cartwright not
h only quickened his footsteps but
- he had visibly paled as he ap-
proached his bungalow he broke into a
run and dashed up the steps of the ve-
randa three at a time
  ah yen he shouted and rather
like a cuckoo out of a clock the chinese
boy appeared from the spare bedroom
  ah yen said charles i want the
truth has eugene pai been in this bunga-
low during my absence
  yes master promptly answered the
boy
  what did he want
  say him wantchee see you
  and that was a damned lie said
cartwright for he knew i wasnt here
how long after i had gone out did he
come in
  no can say master replied ah yen
when you go i go kitchen-side to catch
tiffin coolie there too nobody in
bungalow when i come back i find
eugene pai standing in veranda all same
corkscrew just like he see ghost
  corkscrew looking as if hed seen a
ghost echoed cartwright what the
dickens do you mean ah yen
  him standing very funny way body
all bent sideways him look plenty
frightened when he seen me then him
make bobbery shout very loud where
mr cartlight you number one size
fool i tell him no belong my pidgin
cartwright with raised eyebrows
turned round slowly and stared at his
cousin
  can you make head or tail of that
john asked he because im blowed
if i can
  john eade shook his head
  nor i said he youve got to re-
member im not only a stranger in this
country and from what ive seen of it i
dont mind telling you im darned glad
i am but i know absolutely nothing
about whats been happening in this
place singan from which im told you
escaped by the skin of your teeth
  ive no time to tell you all that now
said charles hurriedly you wait here
for a few minutes if youve got a touch
of fever you want to keep out of the sun
im going down to the office to tell our
telegu clerk-who is one of the best men
we have on the estate-that hes got to
get hold of a policeman and keep eugene
pai under close observation until he gets
further orders from me there are two
men here of the malay states police ill
take the responsibility the district
police officer only comes here once in a
blue moon
  cartwright was out of the bungalow
before he had finished and eade glad
enough of a rest flung himself into a
the thraldom of singan

chair neither the brisk walk in the hot
sun nor headleys whisky pegs appeared
to have done him any harm on the con-
trary he had broken out into a mild
perspiration-evidence that he had
shaken off his chill and his temperature
was down
  for all that he was as puzzled as ever
though he had given his cousin the
benefit of all the information he had he
had been told little or nothing in return
never once had charles mentioned
madame scala though he had evidenced
the greatest anxiety in regard to her the
whole business was as great a mystery as
ever the only source of satisfaction
eade had was that he had found his
cousin safe and well
  eade waited for more than an hour
and as his cousin had not by then re-
turned and he felt well nigh starved he
told ah yen that he would get ahead with
what there was to eat having made his
first introduction to malay curry he felt
an irresistible desire to go to sleep which
was natural enough in the circumstances
the boy had made the bed in the spare
room eade took off half his clothes
and flung himself down and almost at
once was fast asleep
he must have slept for more than
four hours for when he woke up
the sun was low its rays stream-
ing through the open bungalow windows
and the atmosphere was considerably
cooler
  eade got up explored the bungalow
and found it empty in the kitchen he
discovered ah yen who informed him
that his master had not yet returned
  the setting sun was like a great ball of
fire hanging low above the dark trees of
the jungle up the river valler when
charles cartwright came tearing up the
steps in as great haste as he had gone out
  heres the devil to pay he cried the
moment he saw his cousin eugene pai
has cut off he left the place soon after
midday it has taken me the greater
part of the afternoon to find out that
he has left his store in charge of the
chinaman who helps him and has gone
downstream by himself in a canoe
  i cant see anything particularly
alarming in that observed john eade
  well said the other pai wouldnt
leave  all his worldly belongings in
charge of a chink if he hadnt got some-
thing urgent to do but thats not the
worst of it quental got here at half
past three he managed to get the
chauve-souris off the mud and has
anchored just above our jetties ive
been on board and seen him and he gave
me just about the worst news i ever
want to hear
  whats that asked eade
  scalas on the river
  you mean madames husbandeade
exclaimed
  none other scalas the nearest thing
to the devil in all east indies and thats
no mean compliment john he has come
over from singan in a motor launch hes
got a boat he uses for river and coastal
work there re plenty of places on the
way where he could pick up petrol-
macassar surabaya batavia palembang
and singapore
  hes after his wife suggested eade
yes and me and for some reason
or other he has brought poor old le
camus with him
  madames father if quental can be
trusted said eade
  quental cant be trusted but that
happens to be right the old mans the
bait with which he hopes to catch his wife
he would never have kept that woman
all these years if it hadnt been for the
love she has for her father he had the
old mans money long ago that was all he
wanted he keeps le camus drugged
with opium a moral and physical wreck
a man who has lost all the will power he
ever possessed my god he has just got
him like a caged bird its only pity for
her father and the knowledge that she can
now and again do little things to help
him that has kept madame scala in
singan
  she seems to have left the place on
your account said eade significantly

charles gilson
  charles glanced at his cousin quickly
john said he in a serious voice i
take my gospel oath ive played the
game-or tried to he threw out his
hands with a hopeless gesture how
could i help being sorry for her he
asked what could i do but help her all
i could and if you want the truth
john you shall have it its neither my
fault nor hers that were in love
  i guessed that said eade in a quiet
voice bad business charles these
things always are
  cartwright rounded upon him angrily
dont preach to me he almost
shouted ive done nothing im
ashamed of youll admit that yourself
when you know the truth you and i
have got other things to discuss now be-
sides morality scala went on board the
chauve-souris and saw quental darned
lucky for quental he didnt kill him-he
would have done if this had been singan
but he knows weve got police and law
courts here and he never does anything
on impulse and besides there was a fat
german on board who took a kind of
bovine interest in what was going on
  well charles continued after a
pause for breath scala questioned
quental and as the little portuguese was
scared stiff at the very sight of him for
once in his life he couldnt tell a lie
scala got the whole truth about what had
happened in the night how liu tang had
been captured and escaped and how
madame had vanished quental saw
le camus through the windows of the
saloon on the launch he said the old
man looked more haggard and ill than
ever utterly broken and dejected
  and wheres the launch now eade
asked
  thats just the trouble said cart-
wright scala went up-stream but no
one at our offices saw him pass nor did
quental see him on his way up to nolak
that means that hes turned into one of
the backwaters-there re lots of small
tributaries that flow through the jungle
and that launch only draws a few feet of
water scalas hiding somewhere and
somehow or other eugene pai knows it
and has gone to find him
  eade uttered an exclamation of aston-
ishment
  you cant know that for a certainty
he cried
  i do said charles for the simple
reason that pai left here nearly four
hours before quental arrived and quen-
tal who was on the bridge all the way up
the river is ready to swear that nobody
passed him
  john eade tried to think within the
last few hours so many things had hap-
pened that it was as if there was some-
thing in the atmosphere that made it
difficult for a man to breathe
  if this fellow scala has gone straight
to some hiding place in the jungle said
he it looks as if the whole plan was pre-
arranged and the chances are he
added that where scala is there too
will be liu tang
  its on the cards said charles and
if so theyre waiting for something-
waiting until its dark
chapter vi
what happened in singan
dinner that night in cartwrights
bungalow was a surprisingly
pleasant meal in the circum-
stances the two cousins who had not
seen each other for years had plenty of
news to exchange eade had entirely got
over his touch of fever he had no doubt
caught a chill on board the chauve-
souris in the misty river valley but his
temperature could never have been very
high and in the heat of the day he had
sweated the fever out of him
  john eade was not a man who was
accustomed to finding himself in a position
of considerable danger he was one
however who was susceptible to both at-
mosphere and environment and that
evening he could not but be conscious of
the novelty of the situation though to
all intents and purposes his cousin was the
same boy whom he had known years
the thraldom of singan

before at college that was the strangest
meal that he had ever had in his life
  they dined on the veranda which was
illumined by three large oil-paper chinese
lanterns ah yen waited at table
taking the plates and dishes from the
hands of the coolie boy who brought them
from the kitchen up the front steps it
was as if they were sitting in a fur-
nished greenhouse the trellis-work of
the veranda was overgrown with creepers
the orchids in their hanging baskets sus-
pended from the eaves of the attap roof
resembled so many minute fairy faces
peeping curiously from out of banks of
moss and fern ah yen moved here and
there soft footed his features inscrutable
though his bright eyes were wonderfully
alive
  beyond the veranda the night was
dark as pitch there was no moon
not even the palm trees across the road
were visible though they leaned towards
the bungalow and could not have been
much more than ten yards away more-
over there were no stars the mist from
the river hung like a pall above the tree
tops of the jungle
  they had already discussed their plans
cartwright had decided that it would be
useless to try to find scala that night
they might as well look for a needle in a
haystack there were so many jungle
streams up any one of which the singan
launch could have made its way that
they might explore a dozen before they
struck the right one
  and so mahomet could come to the
mountain if they remained where they
were sooner or later liu tang would
turn up all right the chinese hadnt
stolen cartwrights razor for nothing
and they could do no better than be
ready for him even as they dined eade
had his automatic and cartwright a colt
revolver both ready loaded in their coat
pockets also the two sikh policemen
whom the district officer had detailed for
duty at the nolak estate were on watch
outside one in the jungle at the back of
the kitchen the other on the far side of
the roadway
  eade caught something of his cousins
self-confidence instead of being nervous
as eade would have expected him to be
he was more speculative than anything
else he even let fall the observation that
he hoped the night wouldnt pass off
without event
  when youre worked up to concert
pitch he observed guess you want
something better to do than twiddle your
thumbs youve got the stage set
charles my boy for a very pretty
tragedy or comedy-whichever its going
to be and if this fellow doesnt turn up
some time in the night i shall feel ive
got a moral right to get my money back
ohn eade remembered that remark
afterward
  knowledge that madame scala
was in safe hands and being well looked
after was quite enough to put cart-
wright at ease for the time being if liu
tang was joined by eugene pai and even
by scala himself they would find the
proposition more than they bargained
for the sikhs who were big and strong
men were armed with rifles and as ex-
soldiers of the indian army first class
shots it was impossible that any one
could approach the bungalow unheard by
one or the other
  i ask nothing more said charles
than a reasonable excuse to put a bullet
through that chinaman had i not got
away from singan in the nick of time he
and scala would have made short work of
me
  by which token said eade you
may as well tell me what actually hap-
pened on the island
  charles pushed a box of borneo che-
roots towards his cousin
  try one of those said he you can
smoke em all day but youve got to
keep your throat wet in this country
headley drinks short drinks one after the
other and mixes gin with rye whisky i
dont believe in that on the equator
dont drink until sundown and then
stick to stingers and put them away as
fast as you like singan eh well it

charles gilson
was a sort of hell but im glad i went
there i wasnt in the place a year and
yet those months have changed my life
i know that john damned funny thing
the world it was just a fluke it ever
happened
  he went on to tell eade how he had
met madame scala by chance on the
singapore praya he wasnt much of a
psychologist but its pretty clear to every
one that certain personalities blend so to
speak whilst others clash madame
scala whom he called valerie had liked
him from the first and he had liked her
-and that was a mild way of putting it
that was why he had gone to singan in
the first place though he had thought he
was a fool for doing so it was like buying
a pig in a poke but the uncertainty of the
whole business had rather appealed to
him
he had met scala the next day
in the cafe riche behind the
singapore club and hated the
man the moment he saw him a big
broad shouldered fellow with black eyes
curly hair and a black mustache-a kind
of cross between an operatic tenor the
traditional bandit and the reigning mon-
arch of some tinpot principality scala
fancied himself no end he was conceited
about his physical strength his good
looks his brains and money
  though he was a sicilian by birth he
had been educated in holland his
mother was probably dutch anyway
as a young man he had gone to java
where he had had something to do with
a big shipping firm in surabaya the
company had agents in most of the
oriental ports and scala had spent a
good many years knocking around the
indies and all the coast from rangoon to
shanghai at one time he had been
posted in bangkok whence he had been
sent to saigon and there he had fallen
in with old le camus and his daughter
 le camus was a french colonial
official who had come into a good deal of
money in spite of his daughter he
couldnt tear himself away from cochin-
china because of opium he was living
a life of ease and idleness with the
opium smokers extravagant ideas when
he fell into scalas clutches
  before then scala had discovered
singan-a little island not more than
twenty miles across lying not far from
the beaten track between macassar and
balikh papan in borneo due south of the
little paternoster islands and north-
west of the spermonde archipelago
scala had landed there at some time or
other and made friends with the sultan
he was quick enough to see possibilities
in the place the virgin jungle was thick
with mature and healthy rubber trees
and only wanted clearing
  he got le camus to come into the
business and it was the old mans money
that bought a good third of the island
the sultan had had a taste of occidental
civilization and wanted more of it to
which end he found a banking account in
paris more than helpful he did the
grand tour not in the approved manner
of an eastern potentate-for no one had
ever heard of him-but with the sole idea
of exploring all the dissolute haunts he
could find between port said and mont-
martre
  he duly returned to singan with en-
larged ideas and a lightened purse by
that time scalas scheme was well under
way he had got a gang of chinese
coolies down from hainan to do the
clearing work and liu tang had started
off as foreman in course of time the
astute chinese became a partner for it
was he who suggested the main lines upon
which the business should be run
  for scala soon found out that rubber
planting wasnt as profitable as he had
thought especially as his so-called expert
mr eugene pai let him down badly more
than onee besides there was too much
competition in the field and then came
the government restriction of output in
british malaya and that was scalas
chance
  liu tang fixed it with japanese estates
in the peninsula who were ready to dodge
the government and anxious to get rid of
the thraldom of singan

their surplus stuff at a moderately fair
price quental was engaged to do the
running and nobody in the world can
beat the japanese at a game like that
they got their stuff out of perak and
johore without the authorities being any
the wiser scala couldnt trade with the
javanese ports because of anglo-dutch
cooperation but he found a ready buyer
in shanghai who was willing to ship to the
states
  it was a profitable business and it
might have gone on indefinitely had
scala not been greedy by then he had
been married to valerie le camus about
three or four years just long enough to
tire of her and the very fact too that
she was the only person in the island
except liu tang who did not tremble at
the very sight of him made him furious
with her yet in some fashion he loved
her
  and then charles added lowering
his voice the sultan saw her-and this
part of the storys damnable he used to
make no end of excuses to come down to
scalas bungalow so that he might see
valerie he never spoke to her he just
sat there and stared at her and that
used to frighten the life out of her for hes
a fat oily looking brtite a pure bred
malay all the same thats the funny
part about it nearly everywhere you
go in this part of the world youll find two
or three distinct races living in the same
place i expect the sultans forebear
who first settled in singan was a malay
pirate who wanted a comfortable life
the aboriginal inhabitants are more or
less dyaks therere not many of them
left and theyre no good for work
  the sultans palace as he calls it is
on a hill on the north side of the island
well away from scalas estate hes got
about half a dozen malay wives but
montmartre has given him somewhat
advanced ideas and he suddenly came to
the conclusion that he ought to include a
white woman in the collection and
scala wanted more land he wanted to
open up a tract of country to the west
where he had found the best soil in the
island he had got to the end of old
le camuss money and he was putting
his own away
  in true oriental fashion the sultan
took his time over the bargain ive some
reason to believe that weeks elapsed be-
fore he had the pluck to put the propo-
sition into so many words he had to be
careful because like every one else he
was afraid of scala he suggested that
scala should swap valerie for a new con-
cession of land
ind you john i didnt know
that when i got there nor did
valerie herself they wanted
a real planter to run the show that was
why scala had come over to singapore
when valerie found me by chance when
i got to singan i soon tumbled to what
their game was they had an a  little
harbor tucked away behind a long tree
covered islet that screened the place from
view of any ships that happened to pass
they had made a proper wharf in water
deep enough for the chauve-souris to
berth alongside
  quentals boat was called the bat
because she used to fly by night on the
wharf was a godown where they stored
the stuff which quental took up to
shanghai about three times a year they
turned eugene pai into a kind of store-
man after i got there though i wasnt
supposed to go into that godown or have
anything to do with it i darned soon
found out that there was more rubber
there than we had ever tapped in singan
did madame scala know that
asked eade
  yes she hated her husband and she
hated the whole business but she couldnt
leave because of her father quental al-
ways brought up supplies of opium from
singapore and the whole lot of them
smoked it-even valerie sometimes to
try to drown her sorrows
  she never looked that sort eade
exclaimed
  because shes no fool charles
answered she never let the drug get
hold of her nor did scala for that

charles gilson
matter as for liu tang he seemed to
thrive on it the old man and to some
extent quental were the only two who
went to pieces i stayed there because of
valerie for a long time i never said
anything to her nor she to me but we
understood one another all right she
knew i was her friend
  thats why i went about with my
eyes skinned he continued when i
found out that i had joined a concern
that was five-sixths a smuggling business
it didnt worry me much i knew there
was a good deal more than that going on
behind the scenes i had to watch four
people scala eugene pai liu tang and
the sultan i had no idea what i was
likely to discover but i soon struck oil
it hadnt taken me long to size up mr
eugene pai or quental either and i
guessed that they had both got more re-
sponsibility than was good for them i
learned that they were carrying on busi-
ness in a small way on their own they
were selling stuff privately and faking the
way-bills
  but surely scala checked his own
stores eade asked he wouldnt be
such a fool as not to do that
  of course he did said charles
but not all the smuggled rubber that
quental brought down from the malay
states went into that godown quental
always came into the harbor from the
south where there was a narrow strait
between singan and the islet that
rounded a coral reef at the end of what we
called seraglio point they gave it that
name because the channel was like a
miniature bosporus and behind seraglio
point there was a shallow creek running
in a northwesterly direction just like the
golden horn scala knew constanti-
nople well and so did le camus
  quental nearly always came in at
night and eugene pai with two or three
chinese-who made a good thing out of
the squeeze-used to wait for him on
the south side of seraglio point with a
raft they would take off as much sur-
plus stuff as they could carry and store
it in a safe place in the jungle-a hole in
the ground covered with branches and
palm leaves something like an elephant
trap
  did you discover that by chance
eade asked
  no sir not by a long chalk
when you find a rat run you may bet
your last dollar it leads to a chicken coop
i struck their track in the jungle and
being a bit of a woodsman i had no diffi-
culty in finding their hiding-place
what did you do then asked eade
did you take the story to scala and
make an enemy of eugene pai for life
no fear said charles i didnt care
two hoots whether they swindled scala
or not i didnt even tell valerie about
it until months afterward-after i had
discovered that her brute of a husband
was thinking of selling her to the sultan
and how did you find that out
eavesdropping charles confessed
by then valerie and i were beginning to
understand one another she had warned
me there was danger ahead though she
didnt know anything for sure i risked
my life one night by getting inside the
palace which is nothing more or less than
a fair sized bungalow with a separate
building for the harem
  they discussed business in the most
mongrel language that any two human
beings ever spoke though i was hiding
under the window and could overhear
every word that was said i could only
understand half of it it was made up of
malay chinese french pidgin english
dutch and pulu petak the southern
dialect of borneo as i understood them
all except the two last i managed to get
hold of the drift of what they were talking
about
  the next day he went on i told
valerie about it we met by appoint-
ment in the jungle out by seraglio point
i offered then and there to take her
away but she wouldnt go because of her
father we thought we were alone but
we werent we had been shadowed by
eugene pai i expect he got the wind up
when he had seen me going oft in that
direction
the thraldom of singan

  fortunately i spotted him and caught
him before he could split to scala i
wasnt going to trust my life and valeries
to that man he thought he had got me-
and he had always hated the sight of me
-but by god i bluffed him good and
proper i told him what i knew about
the game he was playing with quental
and exactly where he had hidden his
stolen goods and whats more john i
said that i had already told scala and hed
better clear out while the going was good
  you should have seen his face he
went pale green for he knew that scala
would kill him i hadnt any qualms of
conscience about telling a lie to that man
i got rid of him all right and that was all
i wanted he got a proa that very night
and cleared out and i never saw him
again until i turned up here where i
found that he was at his old game
cheating tamils
   i hat piece of bluff gave valerie
  j and me a breathing space
charles went on it gave us
time to formulate some sort of a plan
for scala was in no particular hurry to
close the deal if the sultan was and
before we knew where we were eugene
got his own back h had seen quental
in singapore and told him i was a
dangerous man afterward i got the
whole truth out of the portuguese
when next he came to singan he warned
scala that valerie and i knew all about
his proposed dealings with the sultan
my life wasnt worth a copper-cash
  from that moment scala meant to do
me in and would have done it too if
valerie hadnt warned me in time liu
tang was going to do the job and the
very fact that scala had struck his wife
warned her that he knew he had always
treated her badly enough for months she
had watched him slowly poisoning her
father with opium he was going to sell
her into the harem  of a fat native
prince but he had never hit her before
whats more he locked her up but her
malay servant let her out and she came
straight to me
  we got a canoe and rowed out to the
chauve-souris which was anchored in the
channel it was pitch dark when we got
on board we found quental half
drugged with opium but valerie knew
how to knock some sense into his head
he was under steam already and we told
that if he didnt weigh anchor then and
there we would give him away to scala
whether he liked it or not he was in the
same boat as ourselves and as i had to
get out of the island without loss of time
he would have to do the same or else
share my fate that settled him all
right he knew that if he gave me up
fd split on him he saw the game was
ended
  then there was a scene with valerie
i begged and implored her to come with
me but she just set her teeth and
wouldnt her father was dying she
said and she couldnt desert him
naturally i wanted to stay too i swore
i couldnt leave her but she told me it
wasnt any good my staying-they would
only kill me
  there was sense enough in that said
eade what happened after you had
left and how is it that they have all
come here
  she has told me that said cart-
wright i had a few minutes talk with
her in headleys bungalow scala never
knew why pai had disappeared and
quental suddenly cutting off in the mid-
dle of the night made him suspicious
it took him weeks to find out the truth
when he learned it he was like a wild
beast he swore that he would be re-
venged not only on me but on quental
and pai when he found out where i
was he at once sent liu tang across to
surabaya in the motor launch with
orders to catch the first steamer to
singapore and not to come back to
singan until i was a dead man
  he taunted valerie with this played
with her like a cat with a mouse and told
her that when he had finished with me
he would hand her over to the sultan
he had actually gone up to the palace to
close the deal when she escaped she

charles gilson
got away in a flying proa and had the
good luck to be picked up by an island
ship coming up from port darwin she
had thought she was well ahead of liu
tang thats why she couldnt make out
how he had got to singapore in time to
come aboard the chauve-souris as a
stowaway he must have had the luck
to fall in with one of the coastal packets
from timor
  as for the rest he concluded we
can only guess what happened on dis-
covering that his wife had escaped-
obviously to warn me-scala must have
boarded the motor launch as soon as it
came back from java he probably had
to wait three or four days while the
malay in charge went on the bust in
surabaya when he got to singapore
he probably found out from the harbor
master that the chauve-souris had come
up to nolak and as he knew i was here
he guessed his wife was on board
  and whats happened now eade
asked what do you think the game
is
  i know no more than you said the
other the only thing were certain
about is that scalas not far from here
and well hear from him sooner or
later 	
  supposing he attacks headleys
bungalow suggested eade if eugene
pai is with him he will have been told his
wife is there
  headleys all right said cartwright
ive warned him and he has armed all
his malay servants i offered him the
two policemen but he said he didnt want
them hes got about fifteen men under
arms and when its dark as this the one
weapon i personally shouldnt like to run
up against is the malay kris
  eade nodded in satisfaction and hurled
the butt end of his cheroot over the
veranda the sparks flying in the road like
a kind of firework
  theres one aspect of this business i
cant make head or tail of he observed
scala wants eugene pais blood almost
as much as yours pai didnt strike me
as being a man with any more pluck than
a cockroach besides hes got a guilty
conscience one would have thought
that he would rather run a hundred miles
than find himself face to face with either
liu tang or scala and yet you tell me
that he has deliberately gone down the
river presumably to meet scala by
appointment
  charles cartwright shrugged his
shoulders as he got to his feet
  i havent the remotest idea said he
yawning and stretching his arms you
may depend upon this however before
many hours are passed well learn the
truth-or some of it
chapter vii
tiie jungle path
eade didnt feel- in the least dis-
posed to go to bed he had slept for
quite a long time that afternoon
and his cousins story had given him food
for reflection stretching himself on one
of the long chairs on the veranda he lit
another cheroot
  as for charles he went to the head of
the steps and stood there a moment
gazing into the black night in the direc-
tion of headleys bungalow suddenly he
turned and spoke to eade
  im going round the outpost line
said he these sikhs can be trusted
but its as well to see theyre doing their
job
  he went down the steps and eade
could hear his footsteps on the gravel as
he crossed the road suddenly a low
breathless voice with something of a
snarl in it the words clipped short in the
broken english of every native of india
from kashmir to colombo
  who goes there
  muffled voices and then silence again
two minutes afterward the same chal-
lenge from the back of the house from
the jungle behind the kitchen
  a little after cartwright reappeared
at the head of the steps he was so tall
that his head almost touched the eaves
well said his cousin theyre on the
the thraldom of singan

qui vive all right the fellow opposite was
on you like a knife
  yes said charles casually ive
sent them both away
  eade sat up in his chair
  whatever for he asked
  because we can look after ourselves
john those two men have gone up to
headleys whether he wants them or
not you and i are going to bed right
now
  i dont exactly feel inclined to go to
sleep yet said the other im as wide
awake as a tomtit i feel as if i had eyes
all round my head
  i dont want you to go to sleep said
cartwright you would be a fool if you
did	you neednt even take off your
clothes all the lights are going out in
the bungalow anyway youve got to lie
down on your bed my son and have your
revolver ready under your pillow i ask
for nothing better than for liu tang to
come here looking for trouble hell get
it
  eade rose from his chair
  give me another of those whisky
pegs as you call them said he and ill
obey orders if thats all you want
charles im game another drink and
im sure ready for any one i seem to
have picked up the customs of this darned
country mighty quick you keep your
soda nicely iced by the way
  and another wouldnt do me any
harm either said charles helping him-
self to a good three fingers worth
heres to the night he cried raising
his glass ive had some exciting ex-
periences since i came out here but ive
got a hunch that the next six or seven
hours are going to produce something
extra special
  this morning said eade i was a
sick man dead tired and all nerves i
wouldnt have been much use to you
but now why im just glad of the chance
to see this thing through though i warn
you im not a particularly good shot
ill give you an electric torch said the
other theres a spare one and after
midnight the moon comes up-a full
moon too if nothing happens before
then itll be almost as light as day
one after the other he blew out
the chinese lanterns on the ver-
anda and then put out the lights
in the sitting room beyond
  eade had the spare room from which
the steps led down to the bathroom
that no intruder might enter by this way
the door of the bathroom that connected
with the garden was locked from the
inner side and the trapdoor at the top of
the steps was lowered in consequence
eade felt tolerably safe any one who
proposed to attack them must cross both
the veranda and the front room before he
could enter either bedroom
 nonetheless john eades sense of
security diminished somewhat the mo-
ment the bedroom lights were out and he
found himself straining his ears listening
to sounds imaginary and real there was
not a breath of air the stillness was
broken only occasionally by faint and
indefinite noises in the jungle a gigantic
moth brushed with velvet wings past his
face so suddenly that it frightened him
  he certainly had no inclination to fall
asleep he lay there trying to imagine
what kind of man this scala was trying
to picture the island of singan he had
read about places like that in conrads
books but it had never occurred to him
before that that sort of thing could be
real
  in a way he was sorry for charles
he couldnt blame his cousin for having
fallen in love with madame scala he
actually smiled when he remembered the
chauve-souris
  he felt that the whole of this place-or
rather the little he had seen of it-had
confounded his capacity to associate
ideas little painted powdered women
hadnt as a rule got the reputation for
being courageous she didnt look strong
either and yet how many of her sex
would have been able to travel all those
miles through the jungle and in
pajamas ye gods what a land
  for more than an hour john eades

charles gilson
thoughts kept him company kept him
from getting cold feet and then by
degrees the uncanniness of the whole
affair began to tell on his nerves waiting
there in the darkness unable to move-
lest the camp bed on which he lay should
creak-he found it necessary to remind
himself that he was a new york business
man who believed in a comfortable life
who traveled first class and stayed in the
best hotels he had now a sense of being
imprisoned in themidstof an impenetrable
tangled wilderness he imagined at the
back of the silence soft footed prowling
beasts there might have been no other
living soul within a hundred miles of
him
  and then charles in the next room
began to snore-or to produce a very
good imitation of the real thing that
saved eade from becoming morbid had
he not been determined to play his part
as well as he could he would have
thanked charles audibly for the con-
necting door between the two rooms was
wide open
  cartwright kept up his nasal serenade
for the best part of half an hour and
then apparently getting tired of it he
confined himself to regular and heavy
breathing-so lifelike a reproduction of
the real thing that eade began to fear that
he really might be asleep
  once or twice eade was tempted to
speak but his amour propre prevented
him from doing that time and again he
assured himself that charles wouldnt be
such a fool and yet the doubt per-
sisted
suddenly he sat bolt upright
conscious of the feeling that sug-
gests the hair of ones head stand-
ing on end he had heard noises before
inexplicable noises-rats perhaps rep-
tiles or bats but he could not mistake
the quick soft pattering of feet that were
either bare or lightly shod
  as quietly as he could he swung him-
self round into a sitting position until his
feet touched the floor at the same time
with his right hand he whipped out his
automatic from under his pillow in his
left hand he held his torch
  he was startled by the sound of his
cousins voice quite close to his ear
wait for me charles whispered
  the bright beam of cartwrights torch
suddenly stabbed into the darkness like
the blade of a simitar-a dazzling diverg-
ent ray that terminated in a golden disc
framing the white face of madame scala
  she stood perfectly motionless she
had the staring eyes of a blind person as
indeed for the moment she was blinded
by the glare she could see nothing until
charles switched off his torch and lit the
candle at the bedside she looked first
at charles then at eade and then smiled
when she saw their firearms
  you are safe at any rate she said
i was told that you were dead
  valerie charles exclaimed what
on earth are you doing here
  she was wearing a dress of shantung
silk that belonged to mrs headley-who
was a little woman too she had evi-
dently thrown it on in a hurry for she
was without stockings and her black
shingled hair was ruffled
  ive got much to tell you she said
i thank god that you are alive and
you too mr eade she added i was
assured that charles had already been
murdered with his own razor
  whoever told you lied you see said
cartwright all the same theres a
glimmer of truth in it because my razor
has been stolen and you couldnt have
known that
  no she said and stood thinking a
moment my husband is not often
wrong she added
  your husband cried charles has
scala seen you here
  it was he who sent the message she
answered i will tell you i was asleep
sound asleep when i was awakened by a
voice at my window the veranda as
you know runs round three sides of the
bungalow and i was in the end room on
this side the man at the window told me
not to be frightened i thought i recog-
nized his voice the moment i heard it
the thraldom of singan

when i lit a candle i saw his face it was
eugene pai
  pai how did he get there
  quite easily said madame scala
there are men watching the house and
mr headley himself is awake pai told
the malay syces that he wanted to see
mr headley and the men let him pass
i suppose he found out from one of the
chinese servants which room i was in
did headley see him asked cart-
wright
  no he came straight to me along
the veranda the message he gave me
was terrible-so terrible that it could have
come only from my husband he said-
that my husband was not far away wait-
ing for me that i must go to him at once
he swore that you were dead that your
throat had been cut in your own bunga-
low and if i didnt believe it i could go
there and see for myself
  and wheres pai now cartwright
demanded he looked rather like a dog
straining at a leash
 half way down the road she
answered between the headleys bunga-
low and here he wouldnt come any
farther he was too frightened of liu
tang he thought liu tang was in this
bungalow and might kill him
  was that all the message
  no it is all terrible eugene pai
brought me my husbands orders i am
to go at once to the place where the
launch is hidden if i do not return with
pai immediately my father will be
murdered
  cartwright uttered an oath under his
breath and then turned to eade
  you see the type of man weve got to
deal with said he
  so far the games in our favor eade
answered the opposition programs not
according to schedule youre supposed
to be dead my boy remember that
upon a sudden cartwright flung a
hand upward and snapped a finger
and thumb as if he were throwing
something over his right shoulder next
he blew out the light
  youre right john he exclaimed
we can spring a surprise on scala you
dont mind talking it out in the dark
he asked
  its better said madame scala
quietly eugene pai is not far away
headley knows youve left his bunga-
low cartwright asked
  i suppose so she answered though
no one may have seen me leave
  itll be best to warn him said
charles for if he finds out youre gone
he may be anxious we go past his
bungalow anyhow
  where are we going asked eade
speak in a whisper said charles
ive got an idea we want to find out
where scala is eugene pai shall show us
the way valerie has got pluck enough to
do anything im going to send her back
to pai with the news that im dead as
mutton shell act the part all right
that will not be so difficult she said
i am already frightened i fear for my
father
  well save him valerie said charles
i swear it if we look in at headleys
on the way hell want to come with us
and hell be a good man for the job hes
the best tiger shot in this country one of
the few fellows ive ever heard of who will
sit down in a clearing and eat his lunch
while the beaters drive a tiger up to him
unless liu tang is with him scala has
got no one who would stand up to a java
sparrow well be three to one and if we
cant get the old man away were not
worth much
  and what about pai asked eade
i guess that fellow wont give much
trouble but weve got to account for him
somehow
  dead easy charles replied if
valerie does what i want if pai came
through the jungle he must have brought
a lantern with him
  that is so said madame he had
a lantern in his hand but it was not
alight
  hes bound to light it when he gets
into the jungle otherwise he wont be able
to see his hand in front of his face that

charles gilson
lantern is going to be our star of bethle-
hem john though weve got to keep at a
safe distance or pai may hear us im
going to leave the most important part
of the business to you valerie if you
find out from pai that were on a path
that leads straight to the launch or if you
suddenly catch sight of the lights of the
launch ahead halt-to give us time to get
up to you say youre tired or too
frightened ill back headley and myself
to catch that scoundrel alive stop his
mouth and tie him up to a tree
  and then asked madame scala
anxiously you save my father bat-
tista means what he says my father is
no use to him now you will have to
be quick
  cartwright answered her tenderly it
was so dark that they could not see one
another but john eade suspected that
charles had taken her hand
  trust to me said he god knows
how this nights work is going to end
but whatever happens i wont fail you
valerie id rather die
  i understand she said in a very
quiet voice i will do what you wish
it is the only thing-our only chance
  at that she left them without
another word they heard her
run lightly and swiftly down the
steps of the bungalow on the veranda
they stood listening and presently could
hear voices a little distance down the road
cartwright grasped his cousin by an arm
  come along said he valerie wont
hurry shell give us all the time we
want but weve got to get a rope and
something that will do for a gag at
headleys
  they went down the steps and at the
bottom walked on the stiff short grass
the peculiar wild grass of the malay
peninsula that stands upright like the
bristles of a wire brush pai and madame
scala were on the gravel roadway for they
could hear their footsteps a little way
ahead of them
  it was so dark that it was difficult to
discern even the outline of the tall palm
trees nothing else but the shape of these
could have told cartwright when he had
reached headleys bungalow for the gate
lying in a bay of shrubs was invisible
  wait here john said he ill be
back in less than no time weve got to
let headley know and besides we want
him if liu tangs with scala well have
our work cut out
  what about madame eade asked
she and pai will be out of earshot in two
seconds supposing we dont find them
again
  little chance of that said the other
about three hundred yards farther on
this road ends at nothing hell have to
go into the jungle and he cant do that
without lighting up besides i dont
propose to be away for long
indeed he was back again before
eade had had time to feel anxious
and with him was headley who an-
nounced that he had a loaded revolver a
six foot length of rope and a thirst that
he wouldnt swop for a hundred dollars
  cartwright had already explained the
situation to his manager and the three
of them set off in indian file cartwright
leading headley next but they had not
gone far before charles came to a halt
  we had best wait here said he i
know where we are theres the pine-
apple plantation on this side of us where
the ground drops down toward the river
if we wait sooner or later were bound to
see a light
  and ten to one i know the jungle path
he means to take headley whispered
last week i shot the biggest pig there
ive ever seen in my life ive got his
tusks at home the old fellow looked as
if he could have ripped up an elephant
were after something a damned sight
more dangerous than a wild boar now
said cartwright
  if what ive heards true said the
other the mans something worse than
a scoundrel by god to think of selling
his wife to a malay
  you wouldnt be surprised at that if
you knew him said charles scalas
the thraldom of singan

an extraordinary man vain as a pea-
cock cruel as a cat clever as a monkey
i dont mind telling you that i was
frightened of him theres no way of
getting at the brute hes always so
cocksure of himself
  he wont be-after tonight said
headley by gad look he exclaimed
theres pai
  sure enough there was the glimmer of
a light some way below them on the hill-
side evidently on the outskirts of a strip
of jungle that lay between the pine-
apple plantation and the river cart-
wright still leading they followed a cul-
tivated furrow between two straight lines
of the low growing slender leaved plants
  though they were now in the open it
was as much as eade could do to make
out the stumpy figure of headley who
walked in front of him the light from
pais lantern was more or less sta-
tionary though it swung backward and
forward until suddenly it vanished to
appear again a moment after
  at once headley cut off in a beeline
toward the spot
  come on he cried follow me i
can find the place in the dark
a few minutes afterward they
were in the jungle headley still in
 front as eade couldnt see an
inch in front of him he was given the end
of the rope and holding-jhis he followed
his two companions something after the
manner of a blind man led by his dog
  they had not gone far before the light
of the lantern again came into view con-
siderably nearer than when they had seen
it before indeed so close were they now
to the man whom they were tracking that
john eade was convinced that they must
be heard since time and again one or the
other stumbled and dry twigs were con-
tinually breaking under foot
  for this reason they slowed down and
proceeded with greater caution they
found it safer to go forward with long
slow strides-a gait more resembling the
stealthy advance of some nocturnal beast
of prey than the walk of a human being
  to eade the path seemed endless a
narrow tunnel through a labyrinth
sometimes their feet squelched in sticky
mud while at other times they walked on
moss as soft and deep as eiderdown
  half an hour of it and john eade was
wet with perspiration which dripped from
the back of the hand that clenched the grip
of his pistol the other hand was sore
from holding the rope and his eyes ached
and smarted from staring into the
darkness
  at last the light in front of them
stopped cartwright in a whisper told
his cousin to be careful still in single
file they moved forward on tiptoe feeling
the ground like cats
  the sound of voices came to their ears
the heard madame scalas voice dis-
tinctly and the very words she used
there could be no doubt that she was
playing her part to perfection
  i go no farther she cried i dare
not and then she groaned oh take
me back she said this is more than i
dare do
  little fat headley was life and soul in
the business before charles could stop
him he had gone down upon all fours
and had crawled off into the jungle under-
growth
  wait a bit cartwright whispered
headley means to cut him off and
hell do it too
  he allowed his manager the best part
of a minute and then by giving a jerk to
the rope he intimated that he wanted
eade to follow
  eugene pai was talking protesting
vehemently and even using threats when
cartwright caught him by the throat
a hand was clapped upon the mans
mouth before he could cry out and at
that very moment headley took him from
behind
 they tied a scarf tightly around
eugene pais mouth and then with his
hands bound behind his back they lashed
him to the trunk of a tree
  thats a makeshift gag headley
whispered in the mans ear but itll
serve its purpose you cant escape and

charles gilson
i	warn you it will be more than your lifes
worth to make any attempt to give the
alarm ill settle with you afterward my
friend youre not going to get off scot
free for this nights job or i dont know
the difference between plymouth gin and
lime juice
  from the first pai had made no at-
tempt to struggle the lantern had fal-
len from his hand the light had gone out
and they were in utter darkness
madame scala grasped eade by an arm
  battista she whispered see he
is there those lights are on the launch
  at that moment headley gave a grunt
of satisfaction upon having disposed of
their prisoner when cartwright asked
headley whether they should relight the
lantern eade quickly interposed
  better not said he the launch is
only just ahead of us
without a word being spoken
they advanced in single file
cartwright again leading pres-
ently they were able to see the dense
foliage on either side of the path and the
rope-like creepers suspended in festoons
from the branches of the trees it was
then that they discovered that madame
scala had forced hei way to the front
  headley took her by the shoulders and
held her back forcibly yet almost play-
fully
  this is no place for a woman said he
in an undertone
  my father she pleaded breath-
lessly
  i daresay said he but you can do
nothing the fun may begin at any
moment and if theres shooting well
want a clear field of fire
  reluctantly she dropped back and
allowed both headley and eade to pass
cartwright was now some few yards
ahead they could see his stooping
figure silhouetted against the lights on the
launch and when he went down upon all
fours they followed his example to come
up on either side of him when he halted
behind the trunk of a great tapang tree
that had fallen across the path
  in this they were in lucks way for the
tree trunk was not ten yards from the
bank on the stream which was but a few
feet wide-only just wide enough in fact
to accommodate the motor launch
  amidships was a covered in saloon in
which no full grown man could have
stood upright with three large portholes
on either side of it all of which were open
the light within emanated from two
electric lamps and so blinding was the
brightness that neither cartwright nor
his companions could see anything for
more than a minute
  while they waited they were able to
hear distinctly the voices of the two men
in the saloon the one high pitched and
querulous the other deep and quiet
  by degrees john eade became conscious
of the details of his surroundings he was
first aware that there was a strip of water
no more than a few inches in width be-
tween the side of the launch and the bank
of the creek in the bows of the boat were
two or three men whose figures being in
the shade were more or less indefinite
though from the squatting attitudes they
had assumed they were evidently natives
of some sort
  in the saloon the heads of the two
occupants were visible the one front face
the other with his back to the porthole
the first was the emaciated wrinkled
countenance of an old man who had al-
most snow white hair that stood upright
on his forehead a short untidy beard
white eyebrows and a mustache his
eyes were deep sunken with black rings
round them-watery eyes with minute
irises his complexion was a most un-
healthy parchment color and his should-
ers round and stooping
  as for the other man little of him
could be seen but a pair of enormous
square shoulders and very unusual black
curly hair that grew as thick as a kind
mane over the nape of his neck he was
evidently sitting upon a seat immedi-
ately underneath one of the portholes
  it was he who laughed such laughter
john eade had never heard in his life
before it was laughter that suggested
the thraldom of singan

the panting of a hunting lion there was
neither mirth in it nor satisfaction it
suggested nothing but brute physical
strength
chapter viii
the turn of the scales
for the moment there ap-
peared to be no way of getting on
board the launch without being
seen they lay there listening not five
yards away from the very man they
wanted able to hear every word that was
said
  the conversation they overheard was
carried on in english and french alter-
nately in moments of extreme tension
old le camus lapsed into his mother
tongue though for the most part scala
spoke in english and it was he who did
most of the talking
  have you ever known me not mean
what i say they heard him ask but
my friend he went on in a voice meant
to be conciliatory do not distress your-
self she will come back to me all right
she may be here at any moment
  and then the old man asked
  they could see his face scared
agonized like that of a man in torture
  and then said scala to singan
where once and for all i have done with
both of you
  he rapped out these words with a kind
of vicious glee and they saw him throw
back his black curly head as if he
laughed again
  yes he went on ive had enough
of you valerie has done her best to fool
me but i am neither blind nor a fool
le camus was staring at him hisjea-
tures immobile his whole face like wax
his lips parted for a moment he never
moved
  diable he exclaimed and then in
english you are not human
  i am too clever to be that perhaps
said scala you are nothing to me but
an incumbrance i shall be glad enough
to get rid of you valerie knows that
and therefore she will come back
  what will you do with her in sin-
gan le camus asked
  she shall have time to repent said
scala for the rest of her life she can
find what consolation she can in a malay
harem and such sympathy as she can get
from the daughters of malay fisherfolk
and hainanese coolies
  the old man must have flung himself
upon his knees for his face suddenly dis-
appeared and they could see nothing but
his thin clasped hands he spoke
volubly excitedly and in such rapid
french that of those who were listening
only madame scala could understand a
word
  during these brief moments she ex-
perienced the most terrible anxiety the
most fearful suspense she was powerless
to help she saw in torment-as she had
often seen before-the old broken man
who was her-father she knew the vio-
lence of her husbands temperament and
his unscrupulousness and yet all this
time she had the strength of mind and the
courage not to cry out and disclose the
fact that she and her companions were
there
  she had crawled to cartwrights side
when the old man flung himself upon his
knees the young planter extended a hand
and grasped one of hers in a mute attempt
to strengthen her fortitude
  presently le camus rose to his feet
and they could see the tear drops stream-
ing down his hollow cheeks to hang like
like shining drewrops in his white un-
kempt beard
  sheer physical exhaustion had at last
silenced the old man he stood there
trembling panting scala made a cluck-
ing noise with his tongue against the roof
of his mouth much as one does to a
naughty child suggesting regret more
than disapproval
  pray calm yourself said he i can
well understand that for you these
minutes must seem unconscionably long
it is but natural that you should be over-
anxious permit me to recommend your
usual solace-the opium pipe
  he appeared to lean forward to take

charles gilson
something from the table in front of him
the old man hesitated a moment and
then cried out in french
  never never again the good god
will give me strength
  he must have flung the opium pipe
through one of the portholes for they
heard something strike the trunk of a tree
in the jungle at their backs and then
again scala laughed softly
  how often have i heard you say
that he sighed my old friend your
good resolutions grow monotonous
spare me the trouble of listening to such
cant for once i have advised you for
your own good if you are to be a sane
man when valerie arrives i suggest you
calm your nerves
le camus mastered himself with
difficulty they could see his
face he was moving his lips
chewing the ends of his mustache scala
had spoken in english and as if he found
he could better control himself when he
used a language with which he was not
thoroughly familiar the old man an-
swered in english too
  and if she does not come he asked
  you die said scala quietly
  for myself sighed le camus that
would be-release escape from hell
  scala repeated
  if she is not here by daybreak you
die	but as i have said my friend you
have no great cause to fear for valerie
will come
  he said this in such confidence with
such silken deliberation in a voice so
soft and yet so venomous that the three
men who were listening took in a
deep breath and tightly gripped their
weapons
  they could still see le camus his
face was like that of a corpse more
waxen more still than ever
  scala must have been looking the other
way so sure of himself so despising his
impotent and miserable victim that he
neglected for the moment the most ordi-
nary precautions
  for they saw le camuss face undergo
a rapid transformation his numbed
frozen features suddenly became alive
with staring eyes and parted lips his ex-
pression was that of a fiend
  they saw him move forward quickly-
a spasmodic jerk of the body as if he
snatched something from the table
realizing what was going to happen
those who were hiding in the jungle could
remain in idleness no longer madame
scala gave vent to a half suppressed
shriek cartwright sprang to his feet
headley appeared in the light streaming
from one of the portholes of the launch
with the bright barrel of his nickel plated
revolver gleaming in his hand
  at that moment a deafening report
came to their ears a revolver shot in the
confined space of the little saloon break-
ing like a thunderbolt upon the silence of
the jungle though they sprang on board
almost simultaneously john eade was
the first to enter the saloon where he be-
held battista scala dead
  the man of signan lay sprawled upon
the narrow red plush seat that ran the
length of one side of the saloon under the
portholes his attitude was as un-
natural as his appearance was terrible for
one elbow was pulled in under him and
that shoulder was several inches higher
than the other while the other arm hung
down to the floor
  his legs were stretched out underneath
the table he wore no collar and no tie
his great muscular neck was like that of
a wild beast it was clean through the
base of the throat that old le camus had
shot him the bullet having smashed
through the cervical vertebrae of the
spine death had been instantaneous
  john eade had never seen the man
alive but scala looked formidable even in
death there was a certain massiveness
about the lower part of his face that in
spite of his good looks gave him an ape-
like appearance his lips were drawn
back showing almost perfect teeth under
the black mustache upon the hand that
was visible there was a ring on nearly
every finger including one in which was
set an enormous emerald and these
the thraldom of singan

feminine ornaments looked strange in-
deed upon one who had the limbs of a
hercules
  as eade turned his attention to the old
man his companions entered the saloon
though he still held the smoking revolver
in his hand le camus did not yet seem
to realize what he had done he stood
motionless astonished as if unable to
believe he never looked away from
scala until his daughter flung her arms
around his neck and by then headley
had taken the matter in hand
  this can be hushed up said he
ill wire for richardson the district
officer to come here at once hell not
make a case of it weve evidence
enough that this scoundrel has met with
no more than his deserts
old le camus who had begun
to tremble violently all over was
conveyed by charles cartwright
and his daughter to one of the little
cabins aft here madame remained with
him while her husbands body was
wrapped up in a blanket and laid out on
the saloon settee by then cartwright
had gone ashore with eade and had
brought on board eugene pai still
bound
  headley decided to return to nolak by
way of the river instead of the jungle as
he considered neither madame scala nor
her father in a fit condition to walk and
they could certainly not be left on board
the launch they had some difficulty in
finding their way in the darkness out of
the narrow backwater but by the time
they reached the main river the full moon
was up and a few minutes afterward they
anchored oft the nolak jetties alongside
the chauve-souris
  quental was hailed and told to take
charge of the three malays who were on
the launch but headley was determined
to find a safer asylum for eugene pai than
the paddle-boat and a more trustworthy
jailer than fernao quental who was
known to have been the prisoners con-
federate in certain shady transactions
  two rickshaw coolies were routed out of
their hovels at the foot of the hill on
which was the tamil compound and
these were ordered to take le camus and
his daughter straight back to headleys
with a note to mrs headley telling her
that all was well
  in the meantime the telegu clerk was
got out of bed and eugene pai was
locked up in one of the inner offices until
such time as he could be questioned on the
morrow it was about two oclock in the
morning when headley suggested that
they should all turn in
  there is nothing remarkable about the
fact that all three should have entirely
forgotten the very existence of liu tang
during the last hour or so they had had
quite enough to occupy their minds and
besides the after effect of acute tension is
as often as not a kind of mental negli-
gence on the assumption that enough
had happened that night to last a life-
time they were inclined to believe that
the whole business was ended
  but it so happened that liu tang
though long since incapable of wreaking
scalas vengeance on his enemies had
prepared for them unconsciously some-
thing in the nature of a sinister surprise-
the kind of gruesome practical joke that
might have afforded the astute cold
blooded chinese no little satisfaction
the three men were walking
abreast on the roadway and were
discussing every aspect of the
strange events of the night when they
came to cartwrights bungalow they
stopped at the foot of the veranda steps
to say good night to headley and john
eade had actually climbed half way up
the stairs when he let out an oath and
sprang down to the bottom
  my god he exclaimed pointing up-
ward to the right of the house look
there
  a half naked rigid body was sus-
pended between earth and sky between
heaven and hell-a yellow corpse that
looked to be floating in the moonlight in
mid-air
  like some great oriental gargoyle the

charles gilson
upper part of the mans body protruded
stiff and horrid from the side of the
bungalow from under the eaves of the
attap roof at the point where the canvas
ceiling of the front room ended at the
veranda
  that he was dead there could be no
doubt for the moonlight was full upon
his pale gleaming body though the
greater part of his arms were visible
these appeared to be pinned to his sides
in the sharp angle formed by the beam
that supported the roof and the outer
rafter that continued over the veranda
his head had fallen downward and was
turned a little to the right which made
it appear as if he was endeavoring to look
round the corner into the veranda itself
  cartwright was the first to find his
voice
  what do you make of that he
asked its liu tang all right
  and hes dead said headley
theres only one way to answer that
question charles and thats to get him
down
  they had some difficulty in doing this
and it was a job none too pleasant john
eade standing upon the top rail that in-
closed the veranda was able to push the
body away from him until it was no
longer wedged in the acute angle formed
by the rafter and the beam cart-
wright in the meantime had climbed out
of the little window at the end of the
sitting-room and standing upon the sill
of this he was able to grasp the body with
one hand and jerk it clear of the attap
roof it came away with several dried
nipa leaves of which the thatch was com-
posed as well as with a portion of the
canvas ceiling that must have been
rotten with damp it fell with a dull thud
upon the close cut grass of the little lawn
headley had pretty thoroughly examined
the body with the help of his electric
torch by the time that his two com-
panions joined him and he had found in
one of liu tangs clenched fists charles
cartwrights razor
  no signs of violence here he re-
marked theres rigor mortis and hes
stone cold he must have been dead
some time by gad charles he sud-
denly exclaimed you havent got a
wildcat in your bungalow by any chance
have you
  no said cartwright theres one
next door though beverley says it keeps
him awake half the night tearing up and
down the canvas ceiling after the rats and
lizards
  yes said headley thoughtfully
thats just it beverleys rats have all
migrated to you and youve got a worse
lodger up there in that roof than a wild-
cat a snake and a venomous one too
cartwright whistled
  youre right said he thats what
got him but when did this happen
must have been in the earlier part of
the night said eade you remember
pai told madame scala that she would
find you with your throat cut
  do you mean he was in the roof all the
time
  sure said eade your boy ah
yen told us that he found pai standing
on the veranda with his body all twisted
round looking as if hed seen a ghost
well i guess he went up there after youd
gone to see what he could find out and he
got the shock of his life liu tang saw
him and spoke to him somewhere at the
back of the veranda there must be a gap
between the roof and the wall
  there is said charles i see what
you mean pai got his orders from liu
tang who sent him down the river to
scala directly he found madame scala
on board the chauve-souris of course
liu tang must have guessed that scala
himself wouldnt be far behind
  thats about it said eade and
the fellow lay up here determined to do
his job properly with your own razor be-
fore he joined scala he played his cards
uncommonly well too for if madame had
found us both with our throats cut theres
very little doubt that by now she would be
well on her way back to singan youll
remember we went out of the bungalow
in a pretty great hurry and we naturally
never looked back
the thraldom of singan

  he wasnt there when we went to
bed said charles before i put out the
lights id swear to that
  no said eade it was when we
were waiting for him pretending to be
asleep-and i dont mind confessing i
was just about as nervous as ive ever
been in my life-that that snake got him
and made a better and a quicker job of
it charles than you and i would have
done
the following day the evi-
dence given by mr eugene pai bore
out the truth of eades conclusions
pai declared that at about midday the day
before he had been out on the bungalow
road he had seen madame scala break
from the jungle exchange a few words
with a chinese coolie on the pineapple
plantation and then make straight for
cartwrights bungalow
  he had thought he had recognized her
though he could scarcely credit his eyes
a european lady so scantily attired who
staggered as if she had reached the last
stage of physical exhaustion was an
object quite sufficient in itself to arouse
his curiosity
  he had followed her to the bungalow
where he had waited outside until cart-
wright himself returned by then he had
made quite sure that it really was the
lady he had known in singan he had
heard cartwright say that he was going
to take her to headleys and when the
coast was clear he had gone into the
bungalow to try to find out what he
could from ah yen
  he had been startled by a voice that
he recognized at once when he was on
the veranda he had seen liu tangs face
up above him at the point where the
attap roof crossed the outer wall and
liu tang had told him exactly what he
had to do he was to take a canoe and
go downstream and sooner or later he was
bound to come across scala to whom he
was to give the news that liu tang had
been too late that morning to do the job
that had brought him to nolak but the
thing would be done all right that night
it was of the utmost importance that he
eugene pai should tell scala that
madame had been placed in the charge of
t he wife of the manager of the estate
 when he had heard the evidence
headley looked across at eade and
laughed
  looks as if weve got to thank that
snake for a lot said he at the same
time charles youll have to pull out
that canvas ceiling to get rid of the brute
a wildcats preferable and by way of
explaining the matter to eade he added
in this part of the world sir youve got
to have one or the other its a choice be-
tween two evils thats how we live out
here
  seems to me said john eade that
on occassions therere more than two
evils to choose from
 maybe youre right headley
laughed and then shouted for stingers
detail
it honestly warms my heart and
makes me feel that adventure is doing
a truly great work in the world to see
the way in which scores-on a bad break
thousands-of readers come right up with
no hesitation and criticize any mistake in
our pages though there are times on
any magazine when silly misrepresenta-
tions get through i think that this sort
of thing happens less often on adventure
than-on what name you
  down here in the office were as careful
as we can be any questionable story is
read and re-read until it is well nigh worn
through all authorities at our command
are consulted on doubtful points then
if still there remains an argument the
ask adventure experts are called in-
always with the authors permission
  in this way we feel that our fiction is
kept clean of cheap careless errors at
any rate-but even then there come some
slips here is a small one-important
enough however one of our most popu-
lar and experienced of authors is criti-
cized and admits the mistake
  in the march th issue in a story lost le-
gions major malcolm wheeler-nicholson tells of
american and british sailors having black braid
on their collars this he states because they
are supposed to be in mourning for lord nelson
  how come on every blouse i wore in the amer-
ican navy all i had was white tape if it ever got
black-well we certainly did not hear about it
furthermore i heard it was that the neckerchief we
wore for mourning maybe im wrong lets hear
from somebody that has some real facts on this
too bad that slip came early in the story it left a
flat taste in what otherwise was an interesting tale
  tell mr pendexter to stick to his short stories
they cant be beat but his serials not so good
give us more of tuttle bedford-jones nason
raine they are all good
and how about a long modern story on some big
city dont tell me there is no adventure there
  sorry to have to butt in with a criticism but
wishing you well i am sincerely yours-charles
reechia  lexington avenue new york city
dear mr reechia
  the editor of adventure has forwarded me your
letter containing the how come concerning my
having ascribed black braid instead of white to the
american sailors uniforms in my story lost
legions
  i must admit having stubbed my toe and landed
heavily on my left ear on this detail what makes it
worse is the fact that i really know better although
my knowledge of the navy is rather limited being
confined to those rare meetings when army and
navy would get together for a good old fashioned
party the resulting celebration was generally
such that all details became strangely blurred
i remember meeting the gang from the helena one
glorious fourth of july in hong-kong sometime
i am going back to hong-kong and see what it
really looks like   
i believe it to be a fact however that the amer-

the camp-fire

ican sailor actually does wear a symbol of mourning
for lord nelson as you suggest it is probably the
black neckerchief which was copied no doubt from
the british naval uniform there still sticks in my
mind some legend to the effect that there is a story
behind the braid worn on the american sailors
collar perhaps some one who really knows the
facts can give adventure the correct dope on the
mourning for lord nelson and whether it is the
neckerchief or braid or both
  thanking you for your interest in the matter and
trusting that between us we can find someone who
can give us the correct dope i am yours very
sincerely-major malcolm wheeler-niciiolson
their day in court
not to cramp the style of cap-
tain guthrie whose interesting let-

trifle at his use of the word spotless
doubtless the captain knows his ground
far better than i but i spent a couple of
summer seasons between the skeena

  may i add that olfactory memory once
made me reject unconditionally a darned
good story by one of our best known
adventure authors because he allowed
his chief character a dartmouth college
graduate to fall instantly in love with a
tagish indian maid
  perhaps i was inflifenced just a trifle
too by the fact that i myself obtained a
sheepskin at that particular new england
college at any rate i understand the
story was purchased-without a qualm-

  almost everybody in the states has a miscon-
ception of siwash a name generally and vulgarly
applied to the alaskan indian in two years resi-
dence in alaska as officer in charge of the second
section of the washington-alaska military cable 
telegraph system headquarters in seward i have
learned considerable about this people and respect
them far more than i thought i ever could when i
came up here
  the term siwash is given as a designation
generic to cover the thlingits aleuts eskimos
and all the native peoples along the yukon and in
other parts of the interior the natives themselves
hate it fiercely and to not like even to be called
indians preferring natives if you have to men-
tion them as a class by themselves i have found
great numbers of them intelligent loyal conscien-
tious and even artistic in alaska they are known
either to be slovenly housekeepers and unspeakable
cooks or just the reverse a native housekeeper
and cook who has had proper opportunity to learn
is a household martinet and is widely appreciated
as a kitchen adornment some of the interior
roadhouses are operated by fullbloods and are nota-
ble for their wonderful meals and spotless cleanliness
  as mothers the native women are sometimes
truly wonderful a tribe near ruby has had a
custom ages old of trading babies their babies
are taken away from the mothers at birth by
neighbor women and raised on a mixture of moun-
tain sheep suet and a local weed that produces some
chemical action which reduces the nourishment of
the suet to the value of mothers milk the children
thrive on it so well and the system has been so
beneficial to the health of the young mothers that
nobody in that tribe ever raises her own children
at all in some eskimo tribes children are wor-
shipped in about the same way the chinese worship
their ancestors
  chief alexander who lives near tonsina says the
white man has broken down a civilization which
was superior to that he introduced the so-called
siwash of today wears good clothes studies the fur
markets by radio and votes they are not always
uncomely some of the women are snappy dressers
the young girls invariably dressing as well as the
average shop girls in the states the clotheslines in
a native village indicating that they wear finery
from the skin out morally the siwash if given
proper training is not different from other peoples
of immediate primitive origin and intellectually they
are only a grade lower than the tribes in the states
  one thing i have noticed that interests me very
much is that they have little real chivalry toward
women and apparently no family affection chil-
dren sent to mission school lose contact with each
other as brother and sister and only refer to their
parents when questioned about them and very
indifferently at that-ralph r guthrie captain

a finer vacation than one on which sun

gasoline freighter   
  but read g a es letter

adventure
  we are here at last after some very stirring
exieriences by sea and land came from grand
cayman itself full of obeah wreck and mystery
on a freighter loaded with gasoline which was worse
than an open barrel of gunpowder were over a
week on that death-trap the slightest spark would
have blown us all to atoms it was sure some tick-
lish experience living in a heavy reek of gas and
i admit i was scared mighty glad to get foot on
terra cotta again i see a big story in this-
a maniac on a gasoline steamer running amuck
with a torch have positively all the dope on this
sort of conveyance far more than i enjoyed getting
the captain told me the exact location of a spanish
galleon on a reef not far from cayman he wants
to go after several chists of gold in three fathoms
of water with me ill give you the whole story
when i get back to n y hes a hardheaded old
caymanian and no phantom-chaser positively
affirms the stuff is there and that if we could get a
schooner and a diver we could salvage it seems
to me as if there ought to be some man with a bit
of cash and time who would cooperate the capn
and i have the time but not the cash we could
give the backer the thrill of his life and a 
share of the loot maybe you can help me locate
the right man this sounds like a wild-goose
scheme but judging by the character of the capn
i have entire confidence in it the more so as some
friends of his have already taken a good bunch of
coin from the same reef one months supplies
would be needed as rough weather might hold up
the game we should have to wait for a calm day
or two before diving think it all over and prepare
for the full story when i arrive
  i am now full of obeah voodoo treasure spanish
sunburn sharks palms coconuts and bananas but
no oil of same in a few days leave for the virgin
islands then back here and to new york with
best personal wishes i am as ever most cordially
yours-england
  if any reader desires to inquire further
concerning this project it would be wise
to address mr england at bradford
now hampshire
once aboard your lugger-
 and the delight of far horizons
tx- is yours the gal-well weve
always found her there too note
for once we employ the editorial we
so shall you find her probably in every
port-or even back of beyond
  its the toughest thing i have to face-
this having to tell other comrades about a
thousand and one trips id like to make
one of these times-in camp-fire-im
going to put in a bid for a certain chap i
know he is six feet two weighs one-
ninety was a fair boxer a poor-to-fair
shot a good enough swimmer for thirty-
five and able to cook desert or mountain
chuck but he has never been to sea-
except on liners and on two-masted fish-
ing schooners
  i	wont reveal his name but if after
you read these letters which follow if
you still are interested at all-
  since i was a kid ive been watching the sil-
houettes of men from the far places pass before
your camp-fire ive brushed sleeves at times
with some of these silhouettes at slave lake
matamoras burk-burnett miami or on a little
belgian boat or a liner i chatted with one on a
broken wall at soissons stripped souvenirs from
anothers plane at fismes picked up anothers
broken sword in the avoncourt woods
  once in a while it occurs to me that i ought to
throw a chip or two on the camp-fire flames i
have a chip-a little brass plate-that is good fuel
it carries a name that electrified the world one hot
day in july a few years ago but it will tell its
own story and im almost convinced that i should
offer it for the walls when adventure opens its igloo
as a meeting place for glorious vagabonds
   also im going after more fuel for the fire were
going out in a windjammer when my partner gets
back hes gone down to see if the equator is still
in its proper place
  our boat is not quite sixty-five feet long and is
shoal draft so we ought to be able to go lots of
places
  and now comes the problem we are going
purely for pleasure and we have from now on to
make the cruise or cruises
  we have been asking many questions and still
we havent decided just all we want to do we
plan to cruise the south american and african
coasts well have a movie camera motorcycles
and small speed boat well have short and long
wave length radio
  now we want advice perhaps we wont take it
when we get it but im asking for it what would
you do mr adventure if you wanted pleasure and
excitement and still do something which would count
  im garrulous i know but youre such a friendly
human and such a good listener
  our idea is to keep to the back of beyond
visiting cities only occasionally
  havent you some pet far place which you
would like to visit by proxy or some animal
whose existence youd like verified
  perhaps you ought to know our joint equipment
in knowledge my partner is pretty smart so we
know french spanish german english-photog-
raphy and painting-antiques-animals-geology-
geography-marine science- well well have a
large encyclopaedia along anyway to look things up
the camp-fire

  suggest things thank you very much-donald
mackay u s naval hospital c-s brooklyn n y
dear mr mackay
  adventure has delegated three of us to answer
your fine letter about suggesting something to look
for on your contemplated cruise to me falls the
south american portion or certain parts of that
vast continent
  your idea brings back to me an idea i had years
ago i had conceived making the overland trip
down through central america from mexico to
see how the work on the panama canal was pro-
gressing the c a country was then i believe
much wilder than it is now there were fewer rail-
roads and highways than there are now-and they
do not have them in abundance at this very time
especially of the north and south variety they
most all run east and west what few there are
  well i hit out i made fair time through mexico
down as far as the isthmus of tehuantepec and
asked the general manager of the pan-american
railroad for a pass down to the guatemalan border
he was a mr wise from texas he insisted on
giving me a return pass saying the trip i was going
on was impossible and i couldnt even get through
from the end of the line to guatemala city i took
the return pass and used it as a passport when i got
locked up in a thatched fort on the border the
officers could not read and i told them it was a new
sort of passporte and they let me go i was an
awful wreck when i finally hit the canal zone i
had forded and swum dozens of rivers some of them
literally crawling with alligators and dotted with
swimming sharks i worked a while for the govern-
ment and then hit south america i made some
long walks in that country and i fear me i will
never recover from the effects of a few of them
  now i can sit right here and visualize the entire
s a coast all the way around from panama back
to colon i ought to be able to do that for not
only have i seen the coast for long stretches where
i hiked but i have answered literally thousands of
questions about it in past years i can also visualize
the entire topography of the s a continent in one
hunk and in small portions i can take a pencil
and jab at a map and say there and there and
there you will find something its a danged big
continent
  there are not over a hundred real indians left
down there there are just a few stops on the coast
where something might be seen on the pacific side
these are i am omitting the big ports salaverry
and go out to the chan chan ruins and make
enquiry about the general digging that has been
done in the past and try to spot the place where the
little fish was dug out the big fish was never
found the little one ran to about 
also for my part i would like to know if the peru-
vian government will allow treasure and curios to
be carried out i have heard a rumor that they
have shut down on the permits the old aqueduct
and the modern sugar mill thats using it and the
general dope on the realm of old chimu the great
should give material for a magazine article or a
newspaper supplement
  there is another similar but different ruin near
lima known as pachacamac these are not inca
ruins they are contemporaneous with the incas
and were subjugated by them i dont know
whether you can follow me or not im getting all
spread out pachacamac is fairly well known to
archaeologists im thinking about the big fish
when i mention the chan chan ruins at trujillo a
short distance by rail from salaverry up in the
highlands of peru are the pre-incan cyclopean
ruins and the incan ruins in various places these
are pretty well known the same people put up
those big stones there that put them up on easter
island just who they were no man can ever sur-
mise along down the top of the andes we have a
number of volcanoes and high peaks all the way
from ecuador to chile the quechua indians sub-
jects of the incan kings have been domesticated for
longer than we have
  in southern patagonia the nomad indians used
to make their long circle up and back to the straits
during a year i dont imagine many of them are
left now there is a welsh colony on the atlantic
side of the chubut river there isnt much to see
all the way up to b a thats a big city with all
that the word implies same all the way up to rio
the things to see are back inland there is the big
southern pine forest in brazil the coffee ranches
big cattle also in the south and back behind that
an unknown country to the andes from rio all
the way north there are rivers that might be inter-
esting to travel up then the amazon is a -
mile trip to iquitos any of the river trips up from
iquitos put you into wild country but you are in
a lugger and wont be up there possibly up
around the shoulder of s a you veer west around
the guianas some gold up-country in all three
and some diamonds in british guiana there is
undoubtedly a connection somewhere between the
diamond fields of brazil and this one trouble to
follow it is the heavy jungle back around vene-
zuela you might make a trip or two inland to see the
llano country the poets of the plains do the
herding then along the colombian coast at
honey shark point you hit the san bias coast
they are much tamer than they used to be and
you can stop in their villages if you get back on
your boat before dark
  the only thing i ever heard of being found in
south america that excited undue comment was
when i was in panama a sailor claimed he found a
prehistoric horse and killed it with a club a quar-
ter of a million dollars was spent by an expedition
to go to the spot-and failed to find it it might
have been a sailors yarn at that-edgar young

alaska
the copper river region offers ex-
cellent prospfects for good fishing and
big game hunting
  request-about june i  my brother and i
intend to go to alaska for about a two year stay
for an outing we would like to go inland about
fifty miles to a place where wc could enjoy hunting
and fishing will you please furnish us with in-
formation as to the best part of alaska for this
purpose also as to equipment required for a trip of
that duration also about what the cost of the trip
would be for clothing arms and food supplies
-geo carter san quentin calif
  reply by mr theodore s solomons-there are
so many many places fifty miles or so from the
coast where you would have ideal conditions that i
hesitate to select any also the great yukon valley
is pretty attractive with mighty good hunting and
fishing you might say most anywhere
  the big hunting region most people know about
is the alaskan peninsula kodiak island and kenai
peninsula and also around prince william sound
and the copper river you get plenty of big game
around there and big bear especially but youd
   have to employ a guide some of those places and you
   probably dont want to be bothered it would cost
   you a great deal more to go into the yukon not only
   in transportation up there but in groceries and such
   afterwards
chicle
rom the bush of far off guatemala
comes the principle of one of our
favorite vices
    request-will you tell me about chicle how
  is it obtained are the natives of central america
  the ones that made it into a commercial product
  -rose chew los gatos calif
    reply by mr charles bell emerson-chicle
  also called balta the crude basis of chewing gum is
  obtained from the forests of peten district in
  guatemala balta is the dried juice or gum of the
  bullet or bully-tree used for insulating wires etc
     it is the gum chicle of the bully-tree juice that is
   used in chewing gum manufacture and also as a
   substitute for gutta-percha
     the chicle is put up in bales weighing from  to
    lbs each making a bundle about the size of the
   cakes of artificial ice as sold ic the cities of the
   united states
     the milk of the chico-sapote or sapodilla tree

ask adventure
from which chewing-gum is made runs only during
the rainy season from june to january inclusive
during which time the chicle bleeders are living
in the bush
  the camps are located near aguadas water-
holes and sometimes are quite permanent camps
the houses are palm-ieaf thatched on roofs with
sides made of boughs but they are thoroughly water-
proof at the end of this season of hard work the
chicle bleeders return to their homes for three or
four months to spend in a fortnight all they have
so laboriously earned during the seven or eight
months and then they live on credit until the be-
ginning of the next season
needle gun
ould cure an indian of wanderlust
at the distance of half a mile
  request-do you remember the needle gun-
fifty caliber center fire with a flip-up extractor that
threw the empty shell into the next county every
time they were popularly supposed to be an
adaptation of the muzzle loading springfield rifle
of civil war days they were issued to the settlers
in central nebraska in the seventies as an antidote
for indian raids and they worked fine i knew
an old scout who claimed he could cure an indian
of wanderlust at the distance of half a mile some
range  years ago
i want one of those guns  loaded shells and a
reloading outfit primers etc you will confer a
great favor on me if you will give me the ad-
dress of a company that can furnish this outfit
-f l bukee petersburg alaska
  reply by mr donegan wiggins-i well recall
the old needle gun or -- springfield in
fact i have two of them one being given me by the
grandson of the man who used it in the indian wars
in the seventies
  they were good rifles and very sure in killing
power i even have two of the rare  rimfire the
first variation from the muzzle loaders and i knew
the men in the antelope county nebraska sand-
hills to whom similar rifles were issued by the
government as you mention
  now as regards getting one of the rifles
  rifle at  or carbine at  cartridges at
 per hundred primers at  cents per thousand
are to be hand from the following firm
  messrs bannermans sons  broadway new
york n y the rifles are good used ones
  for reloading outfit the following sell one at 
complete
  the lyman gunsight corp ideal tool dept
middlefield ct
  with this outfit and a few pounds of black powder
and some lead you should have a rifle that would
give you many hours pleasure as much in reloading
cartridges as in actually shooting them and that
will kill game as dead as it ever did ive fired my
old rifles and while they smoke up the scenery a
bit still they certainly do something when that
bullet arrives
