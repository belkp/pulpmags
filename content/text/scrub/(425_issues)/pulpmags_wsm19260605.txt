good reading

by

 charles houston

  we novelists are the showmen of
life said a famous english writer
once putting in other words shake-
speares comment on holding the mirror
up to nature and to be sure it is the
writing people who show us how thrill-
ing a thing life can be they can come
with their little words on paper into
our commonplace surroundings and
change drab existence into glorious ad-
venture they can take us away with
them on desperate affairs send us to
face the most overwhelming odds give
us romance within book covers that
transforms all our workaday world

  it is sheer nonsense to say that we
americans are not romantic that we
spend all our time in pursuit of the
almighty dollar as a matter of fact
we ar the most romantic of all peo-
ples on the face of the earth to-day
compared with us most europeans are
a skeptical cold materialistic breed it
may be because we are younger than
europe because it is still possible for
us to cherish the illusions of youth

  whatever the cause it is true that we
sit at the feet of our story-tellers and
listen to their romancing just as little
children gather round some beloved
maker of magic

  this is nothing to be ashamed of
we have our achievements in the world
of material things we are unsurpassed
in the matter of industry of organiza-
tion of invention ours is the right
then to dream a little if we will to
find in good fiction escape from modern
struggle and strife

  to meet the need that is in all of
us for romance a great publishing house
has called on the best of the fiction writ-
ers of the day giving them free play
to let their fancy wander asking that
they tell us stories that will hold us
in their spell

  here are reviewed some of the most
recent books which that house has pub-
lished they are books about the great
west books of mystery fine clean love
stories they are chelsea house books
your guarantee of good reading the
four mentioned here may be had from
any reputable bookseller in your neigh-
borhood ask your dealer or write to

     apple price  cents published by
chelsea house  seventh avenue new york

  a murder without a motive is the height of

hate and admire and almost respect his out-
standing character for those whose appetite
for detective stories has become a bit jaded i

apej le garf ield story by frbisckley

                           author of peg leg fills the jail etc

chapter i

a good laugh

or about three calendar
weeks circumstances had
allowed me to revel in
the opinion which i
should like to hold per-
manently it is-that
after eight years in the texas rangers
followed by fifty as a sheriff not to
mention various long terms as pro-
prietor of a general store registrar of
births and deaths station master tele-
graph operator freight agent and news-
paper correspondent at three pines a
man becomes sort of vaccinated against

unpleasant surprise i dont mean that
unpleasant events will cease to happen
to him even after he has accumulated
seventy-eight years and a wooden leg
it is merely that having heretofore
been hit by every weapon in fates
armory he will be more or less used
to whatever she hits him with next of
course such an idea is the bunk of
apple sauce to say nothing of banana
oil at the same time i keep going
back to it occasionally regardless of the
fact that it has always proved to be
the forerunner of some trouble hitherto
unknown in my experience

witness the afternoon on which i
start the herewith narrative sitting on


western story magazine

the porch of my international em-
porium and sheriffs office smoking a
cigarette and surveying the landscape
i had run over in my mind all the
possibilities of dirty work for the im-
mediate future including the likelihood
of my going bankrupt at last there
could be an outbreak of rustling just
when i was due for one of my rheu-
matic attacks jake henson might
quit the deputy-sheriff job as hed re-
cently threatened to do et cetera et
cetera i had come to the conclusion
that while any of these things might
happen neither they nor anything else
i could imagine were capable of giving
me that nasty feeling of shock of hav-
ing been taken unawares which is the
most unpleasant feature of mans battle
with civilization

  secure in this conviction and a little
chilly at the approach of evening i
had retired to the interior of my store
i was using the counter as a reading
desk in perusing the mun to odd vol-
ume of my encyclopedia when a
shadow fell across the sunset light from
the doorway and then shut the light
rather completely off my book

  since there is a small window behind
the counter i moved the volume and
never for an instant doubting that this
visitor was a cow-puncher desiring to
swell his charge account with a can of
pears a bottle of ginger ale or some
such merchandise i finished the article
on the nervous system before giving
the newcomer my attention this took
about fifteen or twenty minutes it being
a lamentable fact that the older a jasper
grows in an administrative office like
mine the more he has to bust the book
of etiquette in the eye if he is to main-
tain discipline in his bailiwick without
too much shooting

  well finally i looked across the
counter and what did i behold was
it pie-face lammermoor tom lear
marty odonnell two-toes trotter
pee-wee nicholson wont-wash

walter cowen excuse-me bradley
or any of the other fifty or sixty guys
i might reasonably have expected o
see

  no instead of any of these suffi-
ciently disgusting objects my gaze came
to rest upon a tall rangy jasper who
though handsome appeared to have
been run over by a stampede of two
thousand seven hundred and fifty-eight
cattle and who in point of clothes
wore positively no more than one shoe
and a shoulder holster what inter-
ested and dismayed me more than any-
thing however was the fact that in
spite of his condition and the way i
had accidentally treated him this here
stranger was smiling with all his muti-
lated features indeed he looked as
though it wouldnt take much tickling
to make him burst forth into a loud
laugh

  taking one thing with another i per-
ceived that he was certainly the victim
of some crime requiring my attention
so i reached for my star hat and gun
belt before indulging in any idle chat
having got which appurtenances prop-
erly attached i said briefly

  well and what happened to you
honest i thought he was going to
burst forth into yells of merriment and
from what i came to know of him later
i believe it was only the expression in
my eye that held him back

  i fell off the bluff he replied
chuckling  dismal danny driggs is

what they call me on account-

  what did i care for his nickname
or the reasons for it

  fell off the bluff i asked wonder-
ing whether his method of annoying me
was by turning out to be a lunatic
fell off what bluff

  well ive only seen one said he
and you can bet i wish i hadnt

seen-

  you mean to tell me that you tum-
bled over the edge of that split rock
near gold creek
thats funny



  well it certainly was a rock and

it sure-

  well why didnt you go to gold
creek for your medical attention
then  thats only a quarter of a mile
and you must have walked nearly ten
to get here

  at this he burst into a string of
chuckles by gosh is that a fact
he inquired isnt that just my luck
honest thats a scream there was
i all bruised up and tired out and full
of bits of the spanish bayonet i fell
on startin out along the railway track
in the wrong direction an walking-
tee-hee haw ha-ha ho-ho-ho-

ho-ho i-tee-hee ha-ha-

  why didnt you look in the other
direction anyway i demanded feel-
ing surer and surer that doc brewer
would have to come over and ask this
guy how many blue beans made three
you can see gold creek from that
rock

  he stopped laughing of which i was
glad

  well you see with these guys shoot-
ing at me he said i didnt seem to
have much time to look around i
just beat it down the railroad tracks

and it seems now that i-tee-hee-

  what were thev shooting at you for

who-

  thats funny too i was sittin
there laughin over a comic strip an
positively payin no attention to any-
body or anythin when suddenly one
of these guys comes an shakes me by
the shoulder an says tf you are a
deaf and dummy you put em up too
he shoves a great big  gun under
my nose naturally being startled i
jumped up and pasted him one in the
jaw well at that naturally all these
buddies of his commenced shootin an
 didnt dare fire back for fear of hit-
tin some of the women finally i

jumped through the window-

  by this time my brain was beginning
to spin around on its axis so fast that

i was getting seasick windows and
women and funny papers and split rocks
and mutilation and mirth-they were
beginning to make me feel i also was
crazy shut up i interrupted in-
serting my fingers in my ears and
when he had ceased talking i asked
who were these guys

  how should i know asks the vic-
tim fm only just arrived here from

nev-

  what did they look like then
  well all i could see beyond their

masks-

  masks i demanded with a con-
siderable sinking of the heart what
were they wearing masks for

  its quite the usual thing when hold-
ing up a train replied my informant
patting his face back into position

  i was all out of shrieks so i just
stared at his still smiling visage and
in a feeble voice inquired what train
had been held up and where

  it was the ten forty from long-
horn city said dismal danny an
so far as i had time to notice it stopped
about a hundred yards the other side
of this here split rock i fell off yeah
im sure about that because it seemed
two hundred and fifty years before i
got to the edge of the precipice and
what seems two hundred and fifty years
when youre being shot at is just about
twenty-five seconds and twenty-five
seconds is just about my time for the
hundred

  well i heaved a sigh of relief and
at once got a better opinion of the
mans mental condition if he could
bring me such good news as this-
namely that the robbery hadnt taken
place in my county at all but where
it would annoy ben pokeson-obvi-
ously he couldnt be entirely off his
rocker nothing could have been more
rational in fact than the way he said
he was tired reasoning out that a good
remedy would be to sit down or that
his firmness in insisting that he should


western story magazine

pay for the bread cheese eggs canned
meat peaches sarsaparilla coffee and
medical supplies which i now expended
upon him he was accustomed it
seemed to carry his roll in the nose
of his holster his beautiful considera-
tion for the women and children in the
train having prevented him from shoot-
ing had preserved his fortune of eleven
dollars from being lost

  as for the clothes he said while
i got him the usual overalls and so on
out of stock i cant pay you now
but the minute ive got a job ill be
over

  one moment i said taking the
phone and calling old simon bridges
of the diamond b yeah-bill gar-
field want to speak to simon oh
hello alice yeah your pa thanks

  turning to the young man i asked
have you ever punched cattle be-
fore

  his mouth wras full but he nodded
and made a sound like montana so
that was all right

  oh simon well listen ive got
that new man for you just the very
one you were lookin for hes right
here-only got into three pines to-
day hes a bit battered but nothing-
no he hasnt got a horse yeah if
you want to send alice with the buck-
board say bud-i turned to dismal
danny-are you ready to take a job
to-night diamond b old friend of
mine forty and found

  boofleitch he answered which i
translated as meaning that i might bet
my life on it

  all right i told simon hes
hired say about my commission-
never mind it old friend just give
alice seventeen dollars and a quarter
for the clothes ive sold him and you
may deduct the amount from his wages
dont mention it pleasure good
night

  feeling pleased with life in general
and leaving the receiver off the hook

so that ben pokeson wouldnt be able
to call up and demand my help in the
catching of his train robbers i stumped
over and sat down near the young new-
comer

  you havent been punching cows
lately however said i having noticed
that the remaining boot he had worn
on arrival was hobnailed and lacked
a high heel

  no matter of fact he answered
gathering up a last handful of crumbs
and eating em ive been home-stead-
ing got the land hunger an tried to
eat the state of nevada

  and it gave you indigestion i told
him having heard the same story be-
fore

  well would you believe it he lay
back in his chair and chuckled hon-
est it was too funny said this peculiar
guy you know i worked like-a dog
for two years gettin the land fit to
plant an then when id planted it
twice over owin to not havin known
how to do it the first time the jack
rabbits got away with the crop before
it was two inches high out of the
ground the calm way theyd walk
up an eat themselves fat-i nearly died
laughing

  while i stared at him wfth my eyes
popping he chuckled some more i
never saw such a guy and he wasnt
being brave either with this amuse-
ment over his own misfortunes he
simply couldnt help it

  well after id spent about two hun-
dred bucks on traps an poison an am-
munition gettin rid of the jacks an
planted the whole layout over again
he went on in a rollicking manner
what do you think happened then
honest it sounds too funny to he true
but i swear i tell you no lie tfiere
wasnt a drop of rain all summer an
every blade of everything i had planted
burned up to a crisp

  i couldnt sit there dumb as a jug
and the way he was smiling didnt in-
thats funny



vite an- condolences so i took a chance
and gave a titter

  he-he-hee i giggled insincerely

  he laid his hand on my knee yeah
but wait a minute he said eagerly
i got right to work with a couple of
borrowed mules-id filed on the flood
waters already-and i got to work all
alone except for the broomies i built
a dam fifty yards long six feet thick
an about ten feet high all stone mor-
tared an put together as nice as you
please took me eight months workin
fourteen hours a day well what do
you think happened then 

  well gents i couldnt titter any
more i just sat and looked at him

  after id got all my crops in an
cornin up grand there was a fierce
rainstorm in the mountains an the
floods came down like old boots an
the dog-gone dam gave about four
cracks an a pop an away she went
lettiir the water loose to wash all my
seed away after all my trouble-id
actually laid stones by lantern light
gosh when i imagine what my face
must a looked like i could split my
sides ha-ha-ha-ha-ha oh-ho-ho-ho-
ho-ho  wooooof ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

  the point i wish to make is that he
wasnt faking all this cachinnation in
fact after hed kept this particular
burst up for about twelve minutes he
was evidently in great pain with his
ribs and the muscles of his face the
only effect of my efforts to sober him
by rapping his knuckles with the stove
poker was to increase the spasms owing
to my accidentally missing him once
and hitting my own thumb

  after a little i retired to the porch
and spent my time pitying him and
looking for the diamond b buckboard
it didnt come for twenty minutes more
by which time dismal danny had kind
of got over his amusement

  alice bridges entered the emporium
just in time to interrupt his laughable
account of how he sold his homestead

to a neighbor for two hundred bucks
of which he actually got fifty

 good-by-and thanks mr gar-
field said mr driggs after i had per-
formed the necessary introductions and
alice had remarked that she had to
hurry back home anything i can
ever do for you in return why let me
know

  miss bridges having given me the
seventeen dollars and twenty-five cents
i felt inspired to put forth merely my
standard request to new arrivals

  be a good boy and dont give me
any official trouble i begged of him

  on the contrary ill save you some
if i can said he prophetically with
these blessed words he shoved off leav-
ing me alone and somewhat apprehen-
sive

  i couldnt figure out at first what
gave me this feeling of approaching
trouble but at last the explanation be-
gan to dawn old simon bridges was
a nice old guy in many ways though
foolish in many others but on one
point he was as fixed as death  a
dead indian

  he wasnt going to have his little
alice pulling off any of these here
ranch romances and wedding one of
the help he had decided and an-
nounced that she was to marry a ranch
owner like her pa and he stood ready
to enforce this rule with anything up
to a shotgun

  whereas i now realized that though
alice bridges was herself a merry soul
ready both to take part in any diver-
sion that was going and to invent oc-
casions for mirth herself-her appear-
ance and my introduction of her to
mr dismal danny driggs had been
the signal for that gentleman to can his
perennial smile and adopt the facial ex-
pression of a calf with the indigestion
which obviously indicated-now i had
time to think about it-the beginning
of love

  i didnt sleep that night

chapter ii

a little sunstroke

tp pie next afternoon hot though the
day turned out to be badly as my
store stock freight receipts and vital
statistics needed arrangement and
threatening as had become the rheu-
matic twinges in my various working
parts my fears forced me to put on
my working clothes my peg leg with
the iron ferule saddle up and go over
to bridges had simon been a texan
born and bred or this new hand of
his one of those young men that seem
to be manufactured by the dozen lot
and supplied through a mail-order
house i might have taken my precau-
tionary measures by telephone but
considering that the old man had spent
most of his life ranching in oregon
where things are different while the
new employee had a habit of pasting
folks in the jaw while they held re-
volver muzzles under his nose i thought
it advisable to have a few explanatory
words with both simon and dismal
danny each in the presence of the
other

  this was not to be first because
when i reached the diamond b the
new hand was out somewhere on the
range and secondly because according
to si bridges nothing needed ex-
planation on either side except bridges
astonishing good luck in hiring such a
mixture of all the virtues

  i cant thank you enough bill
said simon patting me on the back un-
til we stood in a cloud of dust if
i wasnt well acquainted with your
sturdy independence of spirit i should
ask you to accept a ten-dollar bill as a
recognition of your finding danny for
me but as it is he went on hastily
i can only express my gratitude hon-
est i didnt know there were any
punchers like him outside of oregon
what you figure needs explaining about
him is more than i can tell

  well said i he kind of laughs
a lot for one thing

  is that a drawback protested old
bridges too wrapped up in his sub-
ject even to notice that we were stand-
ing in the full glare of the sun and
me with my throat as dry as a lime-
burners wig bill if youd had as
much experience as i have with punch-
ers who look down their noses if you
ask em to do some little extra thing
such as riding over to longhorn city
in an evening or getting up an hour
or two early to dig a drainage ditch
thats badly needed youd appreciate
having a guy around that grinned a
bit he--

  another thing i interrupted look-
ing yearningly at the veranda where
alice was rocking in a wicker chair and
drinking iced lemonade through a
straw i forgot to mention to him your
ideas about-er-your opinions con-
cerning-aw- 

  not another word says simon
nodding and winking at me mysteri-
ously i understand but hes not
the kind of jasper to spend his time
dangling after the boss daughter when
he aint wanted alice is a sensible
girl and whats more to the point bill
-well well see about that in time
all ill say now is that driggs is the
kind of puncher that makes a man
change his opinions about punchers
imagine a new hand turnin up an
before hes been here twenty minutes
fixin to save me hundreds an hundreds
of dollars on ditch diggin alone
how

  dynamite said simon used in a
way i never heard of though he says
its well known then again you know
as well as anybody how i been laughed
at for tryin to protect my cattle against
this here hollow-horn disease

  he had indeed there being as every-
body knows no such disease in exist-
ence up in the northwest cattle quite
commonly get their horns frozen dur-
til ats funny



mg the winter and shed them in the
spring-these relics being taken by
folks that dont even know all horns
are hollow as a symptom of some new
scourge in texas where we dont go
in much for ten-below-zero weather of
course the evidence is lacking except
when a beef breaks a horn off in a
fight and you can bet your life that
the diamond b men werent in the
habit of reporting any of these dejected
members that they did happen to find
however strict old bridges orders on
the  subject might be naturally
enough they didnt want to go scour-
ing the range on a false alarm roping
perfectly peppy cows and giving em
pills or what not

  w ell continued the poor old en-
thusiast this boy didnt laugh at me-
no sir he knew too much seen
the ravages of the plague himself work-
in cows up in montana he says to
me he says-

  here he comes now if im not mis-
taken i interrupted still with one eye
on the veranda

  after a moment however the optic
which was fixed upon the approaching
mr driggs hogged all my attention
and drew its brother to join it so obvi-
ously did his method of riding indicate
something radically wrong it was as
i have remarked a hot day neverthe-
less dismal danny had come into sight
plying his spurs in an effort to reach
the ranch house sooner than possible
t ie looked so desperate and the clouds
of dust around him was so big that
for a second or two t absent-mindedly
thought of indians

  at a range of about fifty yards he
saw us wrenched his pony to the left
so hard that its rear legs absolutely
slipped and as he galloped down on us
raised his left arm brandishing some-
thing in the air i couldnt see what
it was and neither could bridges un-
til having done a flying dismount-
after which his poor horse lay down

and rolled-the messenger flung the ob-
ject at our feet then we perceived
that if you talk of the devil he certainly
will appear the trophy was rlone
other than a steers horn evidentlyde-
tached from the animals head akid
naturally hollow all the way up

 i-found it-other side-blue
creek gasped dismal danny driggs

  simon staring at this sign of death
to his herds and ruination for himself
gave what i can only describe as a
bass shriek i myself should have re-
garded this as sufficient reaction to the
news but mr bridges didnt stop there
i must explain at this point that he
is a gentleman bountifully equipped by
nature with white hair and whiskers
he is the only person i ever met whose
hair would literally stand on end in
the days before those scary mary
toys came into the market and when
all of us boys around three pines were
younger and less dignified we used to
have a lot of fun with simon telling
him some frightful news such as that
the country was going dry and watch-
ing his thatch defy the force of gravity
he used not to have any whiskers in
those days and  have got to confess
that the stunt he now pulled off with
their assistance nearly keeled me over
hardened as  was

  his hair started to stand up from the
crown of his head forward-that was all
right and i regarded the phenomenon
with interest but without surprise
when however his goatee arose and
stuck out like a bowsprit and his side
whiskers raised themselves into a posi-
tion that would have got him first prize
at a persian cat show even i had to
grin as for dismal danny driggs he
gazed at his employer for some seconds
as though hypnotized gave a kind of
choking sound fell flat down on the
grass and literally began to writhe

  the suns been too much for the
poor lad said bridges in a dazed
tone you look after him bill take
western story magazine

him into the house ive gotta--hi

you-all in the bunk house you
reddy you jones what do you
think youre doin you bow-legged lot
of food destroyers

  naturally enough the spectacle of
dannys flying arrival had wakened the
six or seven punchers that were off
duty and they were now standing in
the doorway of the house old simon
advanced toward them at a run wring-
ing his hands and calling them names

  get your horses he cried jump-
ing back and forth in his indecision as
to whether to punch them all first or
get the veterinary supplies and hit them
afterward you trotter-fork your
mule and beat it over to longhorn city
for doc smith odonnell-ride
around and get every hand on the place
an tell em to meet me at blue creek
hop to it you lot of paralytics

  honestly he held me fascinated for
three minutes at the end of which time
there was nothing to be seen of him
but a dust cloud rapidly receding to the
south with five men while two-toes
and marty odonnell receded with
equal rapidity to the north and east
the thermometer was at a hundred in
the shade the atmosphere had been
made a good deal warmer by the re-
marks of the boys as they saddled up
nevertheless i stood there like an as-
bestos statue until dismal danny
driggs began to make gasping noises
and to tap me  the ankle

  help me-into-house said he
faintly ill fry--if i-stay here

  the way hed laughed had probably
jarred all his pores open so i picked
him up and commenced to assist him
toward the bunk house in the door-
way sat tom lear exempted from duty
by a sprained ankle but obviously ready
to murder mr driggs for old sakes
sake the body would no doubt have
been a nice present for the rest of the
boys on their return but it was not

so to be before we were halfway
there mr driggs still making small
gurgles and snorting noises as i shoved
him along there was a rustle of silks
alice came flying off the porch

  where are you taking him she
demanded hes to come into the
house he can lie down on daddys
bed im so sorry its perfectly ter-
rible oh dear how do you feel now
mr driggs

  if he had as i confidently expected
greeted this inquiry with a shriek of
laughter this story would come to an
end right here i was sure that after
the way old simon had affected him
the mere sight of a member of the same-
family would be enough to touch him
off again however there descended
upon dismal dannys features that
sweetly solemn expression which had
kept me awake all night

  i feel-weak miss bridges said
he in a faltering voice immediately
she took him under the other arm and
tom lear literally got up and danced
on his sprained leg i feel-kind of
-weak and sick

  i dont wonder said alice look
out for that gopher hole lean right
on me mr garfield would you mind
running ahead and asking maria to feel
under the bookcase in the living room
and get out the bottle shell find there
theres just one drink left lean heav-
ily on me mr driggs do please
theres nothing so bad for sun-
stroke i said as alcohol

  danny turned a real vicious eye on
me i dont believe this is the sun
he gasped pitifully i think-its just
-exhaustion

  hurry hurry cried alice as the
poor invalid tripped on a blade of grass
and staggered hither and yon

  weil that was that and there was
a lot more to it besides such as dismal
dannys being commanded-after he
had lain down for fifteen minutes-to
take the easiest chair on the porch
thats funny



and to ask for more ice in his lemonade
any time he felt it getting too warm

  i dont propose to go into the horrors
of what he got away with myself be-
cause it might be thought that i was
prejudiced on account of having been
made to play gooseberry and thus com-
pelled to start for home long before i
was ready instead let me describe
tom lears view of the afternoons in-
cidents as evidenced by his actions

  concerning this i will state that
when i dropped into the bunk house
en route for my nag mr lear was not
in the doorway not sitting on a chair
not even upon the floor he had in
fact taken off all his clothes and gone
to bed furthermore piling himself up
with blankets-despite the temperature
-until nothing was visible of him but
his nose

  go away he mumbled upon hear-
ing my footstep go away bill gar-
field  its no use

  poor boy i sympathized with him

  whats no use  i asked in the tone
i generally keep for the very best local
funerals

  its no use your cornin around
shrieked tom lear flinging oft the cov-
ers and sitting up in a high state of
rage and perspiration lookin the way
you do with your sideburns and your
benevolent expression an tryin to
make me believe youre santa claus

  at this his strength seemed to leave
him and he sank down on his elbow
gazing at me in a haggard manner

  there aint none said tom hol-
lowly

chapter iii

good-by 

pespite cow-punchers reputation
for changing their minds every five
minutes the prevailing opinion of tom
lear and the whole diamond b bunch
when they came over to my store two
days later to spend saturday afternoon
eating canned fruit was that kris

kringle was dead dismal danny
driggs had murdered him

 though whatever anybody ever
called him dismal for said mctav-
ish graham who is a scotsman and
very literal minded i dunno he re-
minds me more of a laughing jackass
than anything else

  youve got no kick cornin said
tom lear he got the saddle on your
hawse for you this mornin when you
couldnt do it yourself now-

   twasnt my hawse-it was that
new mustang bridges got the other
day shouted graham in a voice that
made me reach for the stove poker a
wild ragin man-killer an if he did
get the saddle on him what did he
do when the nag gave me a little spill
why he leaned up against the corral
railin an laughed at me until i darn
near went up an punched him in the
jaw

  well why didnt you i inquired
knowing that nothing saves so much
ammunition as a good fist fight

  i would of said mctavish look-
ing kind of hot and uncomfortable
only that-er-only that-

  you didnt dare said two-toes
trotter who doesnt love graham too
much

  ouch yelled the insulted party
suddenly putting all the fingers of his
right hand into his mouth

  after which tossing the poker lightly
from hand to hand to show my agility
with it in case everybody hadnt seen
me swipe graham over the knuckles i
myself took charge of the meeting

  with your permission gents i in-
formed the assembly we will totally
refrain from rising and hurling our-
selves at each others throats not so
much on account of the possible damage
to our persons which are of no value
to anybody but out of consideration for
the furnishings of this international
emporium and sheriffs office which
belong to w garfield a just man but


wlsiern story magazine

a stern one instead we will behave
like little gentlemen and if we have
any accusations against our absent
friend d driggs esquire we will
cough them up in aunties hand
whats he ever done to you for in-
stance you marty odonnell

  didnt he get us all sent out ridin
around in a blast furnace two days
ago demanded marty dropping a
whole apricot on the floor and getting
so hot under the collar that he forgot
to pick it up again

  he did indeed said i but thats
ancient history if you were goin to
kill him for that why didnt you do it
right away

  well- replied marty trying to

hide considerable embarrassment behind

a new apricot i-er-

  evidently mr driggs was appearing
even more of a bear cat on closer ac-
quaintance than he had seemed to me
i was just rejoicing in this because it
made my chances of having to step in
and protect him so much the less when
a sinister voice from a corner broke up
the happy dream

  why should we slaughter the gig-
glin hyena growled pie-face lamrner-
moor when we can get it done
for us

  ssssssh whispered a dozen other
citizens

  one of the things which has kept me
alive up to the present date in spite of
my early birth on july   is my
remarkable ability to take a hint how-
ever small so i inquired bringing
the stove poker to rest-save for a slight
shaking movement-in my right hand
and who if i may make so bold as to
put such a question is the obligin
thug in the case

  suppose you mind your own busi-
ness said two-toes trotter putting
all his knuckles where i couldnt get at
them but entirely forgetting his knee-
caps oh curse your silly soul bill
garfield youve crippled me

  only for the moment i reassured
him taking a firm grip of pie-faces
left ear now come mr lammer-
moor just the name of the gentleman
thats to deal with mr driggs for you
tf you want to add the date and place
of the proposed felony of course ill
stop twisting even sooner but dont
i added using the poker a little try
to bite my wrist please

  its aubrey bleachmantle shrieked
pie-face suddenly this afternoon-

at the diamond b oh bill-

  pie didnt need to plead with me as-
tonishment had forced me to relinquish
my grasp

  do you mean to tell me said i
surveying the whole gang much to their
discomfiture that a son of the bleach-
mantle family a disrespected ranch
owner in his own right is thinking of
so far demeaning himself as to fight
with a mere cow hand  it cannot was 
oh cant it answered mctavish
graham well unless i miss my guess
it not only can was but by this time it
probably has should what the blazes
do you expect when a big fightin guy
like bleachmantle has been hangin
around a girl for three months and then
finds her ridin around an siftin on
the porch an so on with a guy that
hasnt been in the country moren five
or ten minutes i wouldnt be sur-
prised if he dotted old bridges one in
the snoot either first sayin nobody had
a chance but a ranch owner an then

the next thing you know-

  well i should be surprised i in-
formed him putting on my gun belt
star and hat as usual very much sur-
prised and pained and angry if any-
body has so far forgotten himself as
to dot anybody on the nose without my
permission come on take your cans
along with you and hurry to get out-
side

  where are you goin bill  a wail
arose

  the diamond b
thats funny



  but you yourself asked us why we
hadnt pasted him one

  quite-when you had reason to
bleachmantles got no reason to except
that miss bridges dont like him any
more seemingly an for my part i
dont see how she could ever have
seemed to a great hulking bully like
that he aims to pick a fight and a
picked fight generally means a gun
light an gun fights are my meat out-
side now an let me get this door
locked

  well go over to timsy geogehans
then said tom lear sulkily

  since it is no use to mention my busi-
ness rivals to me when i am on the
path of duty and since i knew that
timsy wouldnt charge more than a
dollars worth of fruit per man per
afternoon i brightly told them to go
ahead then i mounted tony and
started for the bridges ranch

  of my journey over there i will
merely report that the day was even
hotter and dustier than thursday had
been my arrival is sufficiently de-
scribed by the statement that no mur-
ders had yet occurred though it didnt
require any psychic gifts to see several
floating around in the atmosphere
bleachmantle and dismal danny driggs
and alice and old simon bridges were
all  the porch and ever one was
glad to see me except bleachmantle
as to their states of mind t would
state that bleachmantle was obviously
ready to bite holes in corrugated iron
roofing alice and her father were so
nervous that they had respectively gone
pale and started to play snowstorms
with bits of paper dismal danny was
perfectly perfectly calm though not
grinning as usual

  its a pity said bleachmantle after
some idle conversation between the five
of us that your face is all plowed up
by that nasty purple scar mr driggs
youd be real pretty if it wasnt for
that

  i hadnt noticed the scar when
danny had called at my store owing
to his having so many other brighter
colored and newer than the one to which
bleachmantle alluded however i no-
ticed it now-a sort of two-inch dent
over his left eye

  driggs is the name said danny
mildly d for dumb-bell mr bleach-
mantle yeah that scar does sort of
wreck my beauty funny coincidence
-it was a criminal that made it only
he didnt have time to make any re-
marks about its appearance

 did you-did you-arrest him
stammered alice trying to stall off
calamity

  no miss said danny

 oh he-er-he-er-

  got away sneered bleachmantle

  no miss said danny addressing
himself entirely to the starter of the
question and letting the thing go at
that

  i found out later that hed served
two years as deputy to old eat-em-
alive watkins near bishop city and
only left because watty couldnt stand
being laughed at when shot

  after this there was kind of a sick-
ening silence which was frazzling even
my nerves and which was evidently re-
ducing alice bridges and her pa to a
condition of positive idiocy neither
simon nor danny had a gun on
whereas a bulge under bleachmantles
left arm announced that he had one
anyhow and while t was plentifully
armed the veranda provided nothing
under which the noncombatants could
crawl

  lets go for a walk cried alice
suddenly thus proving her state of mind
to be far nearer lunacy than i had
thought

  with the bright idea of cooling us
off by means of a stroll through the
one-hundred-and-ten degree sunshine
she jumped up from her chair her
leap was kind of unstudied and hasty


western story magazine

not to say careless the result being that
she caught some tuck frill fold plait
ruffle hem gusset or gather of her
dress on a curlicue of the chair and
ripped the whole back panel out of the
thing from her neck to her knees
luckily she had her back to her pa
and me who have both been married
men with grown-up daughters even if
i havent seen mine for thirty-eight
years the accident seemed to embar-
rass her a whole lot nevertheless she
backed off the porch into the house
with a face as red as a barn and we
heard her go rushing upstairs to put
something else  then without a
moments warning dismal danny
driggs grabbed hold of a veranda pil-
lar and began to laugh

  i thought id heard him throw off
a chuckle or two before that time now
i realized that comparatively speaking
id never met him except when he was
sunk in the lowest depths of gloom i
figure that on this occasion he was made
worse by the nervous strain hed been
standing all afternoon and also by the
ghastly efforts he was making to hold
himself in every once in a while
noticing simon and bleachmantle and
me looking at him disapprovingly-and
also knowing that alices room had a
window right above the porch roof-
the poor fellow would clap one of his
hands across his mouth and hold it there
with the other until the pressure became
too great then hed blow up with a
yell you could hear in salt lake city
utah there wasnt any doubt that he
wanted to stop laughing i distinctly
saw him pull a pin out of his lapel
and sink it in his leg to a depth of
half an inch but it was no good this
here sense of humor of his was too
strong for him finally he gave up
all attempts at control and just hung
to the porch railing bellowing his head
off

  father cried alice from the head
of the stairs inside

  it has always been my personal rule
when hearing a woman use that exact
tone to start singing i want to be
happy at the top of my voice-and
go visit some other section of the
county old simon couldnt very well
do that having no official business else-
where so he ducked humbly through
the entrance door

  after a little while he came out
looking palish and with his hair about
half elevated he hummed and hawed
in the doorway for about thirty sec-
onds  then  he walked over and laid
his hand on dannys shoulder

  im sorry my boy he said affec-
tionately but-er-but-my daughter
-aw-my daughter-er-she-mm

  probably has a headache suggested
bleachmantle nastily as if it was only
to be expected after the bombardment
well as for me ill push off

good-

  no said old bridges not you
bleachmantle please stay i want you
to join us-me-in a cup of tea

  did any reader ever witness the spec-
tacle of a man looking perfectly heart-
broken and at the same time giggling
and chuckling to such an extent that he
couldnt speak  i never had up to then
and if asked i would have bet next
years reward money to a jefferson
davis nickel that the feat could not
be accomplished however it can so
if anybody offers to lay money dont
take it dismal danny driggs pulled
off the double event with ease i may
say in passing that i never want to
see it done again though accustomed
to sad events such as hangings and the
arrest of gentlemen with large families
i havent been so harrowed up in a long
time as i was by the sight of that poor
boy his afternoon ruined all his
hopes nipped in the bud and his rival
watching him he went to the deserted
bunk house still gurgling and holding
his ribs as he walked
thats funny



  will you-er-will you stay for tea
too bill asked old bridges evidently
craving company

  i thank you no i never drink
anything stronger than whisky in the
afternoon and besides i continued
turning my back to bleachmantle and
using my lowest tone it seems to me
you might have done a bit more plead-
ing for that boy if youre as stuck on
his abilities as all that

  i did bill said the poor guy
wringing his hands and drawing up his
lip in dislike of bleachmantle but
she-

  and anyhow i concluded hearing
bleachmantles triumphant footsteps at
my back all i disturbed myself for
was to see no-that nothing occurred
around these parts as you might say
the cause of anything that might have
occurred being now removed i will go
home and take my harness off good
afternoon simon say the same to alice
will ya good afternoon mr bleach-
mantle 

  this is not the place to detail my
griefs against this latter gentleman
suffice it to say that in my opinion as
in that of most other inhabitants of
three pines he is a pale-pink son of a
gun accordingly he doesnt like me
either personally or officially

  by he answered with his back to
me

  good-bywhat  i queried having a
reputation to maintain

  do you know he swung around as
though intending to be even ruder
only something seemed to check him
and change his mind i cant think
what-unless it was the gun i happened
to be holding in my hand

  good-by said bleachmantle star-
ing at this

  and the rest

  garfield

  but didnt i say mister bleach-
mantle 

  mister garfield then

  and the whole lot in a nice polite
voice

  good-by mr garfield

  splendid said i replacing my gun
as alice suddenly appeared in the door-
way

  well good afternoon miss bridges
good luck

  and so i went home

chapter iv

a pjcnic

por the next five days that is until
the following thursday i enjoyed
peace and quiet enlivened only by a
rather acrid correspondence with ben
pokeson concerning train robbers it
appeared from bens remarks by tele-
phone telegraph and picture post card
illustrating the longhorn city free
library that though no  had been
tickled practically within the gold
creek city limits on the occasion of
danny driggs adventure the ticklers
hadnt seen fit to await bens arrival or
give him a decent chance of meeting
them subsequently they had in fact
taken to the hurst county hills among
which ben being somewhat of a fat-
head despite his remarkable talents in
a free-for-all had been totally unable
to find them

  it was his view that under the cir-
cumstances it was my duty to raise a
posse replacing the one that had called
him names and gone home i should
place myself rheumatism and all at the
head of this organization in short
muck in and do his job for him when
i remarked that i didnt myself per-
sonally just seem to figure the thing out
exactly that way his behavior and his
language over the phone became per-
fectly scandalous finally i had to
send jake henson my deputy over to
gold creek either to conciliate mr
pokeson or knock his block off but in
any case to put a stop to his custom


western stgry magazine

of calling me up at three a m and in-
sisting me

  jake returned at eleven oclock
thursday morning having succeeded by
the second method however said
he sitting down on the counter and
drinking ginger ale it seems to me that
wed better be throwing one of our ex-
tra eyes around our own county about
now bill

 why

  well you remember that general-
alarm sheet we got from idaho a month
since-the one we laughed over be-
cause there was no photographs of the
wanted guys no finger prints and no
description except of their clothes
ive got it tacked up in the kitchen
i told him to remind me that hope
springs eternal in the human chest
what of it

  well of course its just a chance
said jake taking a long drag at his
cigarette but ben pokeson had that
sheet laid out on his office table when
i dropped in and he seemed all-fired
anxious i shouldnt get a slant at it
why so

  five thousand reward for two of
the guys and one thousand each for
two others murder and robbing the
mails and what i could gather in gold
creek sort of tallied with what the
sheet said bill trainmen seemed to
remember two strange guys ridin back
an forth on no  a week before she
was held up this bunch is supposed
to spy out the land very thoroughly be-
fore actin which is why they aint ever
been caught then again they were
masked from hat to chin-holes cut in
the handkerchiefs-an they wore gloves
so their hands couldnt be recognized
the idaho sheet mentions that too
an-

  well i groaned what are we
goin to do then

  jake looked down his nose i fig-
ure this ticklin of no  was just a
tryout of local conditions said he

the sheet says theyve done similar
before what theyre aiters most
likely the pay car for the construction
works at dead mans gulch

  shut up i told him the walls
have ears

 well anyhow said jake i
thought it wouldnt do any harm to
sort of absent myself from your side
bill and more or less mooch around
lookin for strangers with a taste for
train ridin hither an von itow about
it

  fine i exclaimed

  you meanwhile stayin here added
jake getting off the counter and wiping
his mouth giving your well-known im-
personation of a genteel old gentleman
who really has no suspicions of any-
body

   tis well

  then pip-pip said my deputy leav-
ing take care of the rheumatics
bill

  it was a warm day again and all this
consideration on jakes part had filled
me with loving kindness toward my fel-
low man otherwise having promised
to watch my health at all costs i should
not have acted as i did half an hour
later when a horse came to a disgusted
halt outside the store and the miser-
able-looking figure of old simon
bridges entered dressed in its best
clothes

  hello bill said simon sort of
shrinking

  well said i briefly being still
disgusted at his actions the saturday
before

  i want a dozen cans of sardines
please bill mr bridges suggested
an-an a little sympathy for petes
sake

  what for  i demanded though in-
wardly sorry for the guy

  my daughters goin to marry that
bleachmantle simon moaned bill
he sat on my porch last night till all
hours flatly tellin me that if i thought
thats funny



there was such a disease as hollow

horn i was a-

  your family affairs dont interest
me i told him since it became obvi-
ous that your daughter runs em i
asked you what you wanted the sar-
dines for so i can know whether to
give you the small silvery morsels of
deliciousness at fifteen cents or the big
he-mans fish price a quarter

  i dunno theyre for a picnic said
simon abandoning all pretense of man-
hood and burying his face in his
hands at which im listed to get up an
tell the assembled punchers about
alices engagement look at my fancy
vest if you dont believe me

  i stared at his bowed head for some
seconds

  will danny driggs be present i
inquired

  no replied the anguished father
all the other boys got the day off and
an invitation to the picnic except him
hes out somewhere diggin ditches this
patent way of his the poor boy oh
dear oh dear

  i slapped down twelve cans of the
largest sprats in stock and in silence
took three dollars out of five

  anything more

  bill exclaimed old simon in a
heartfelt manner

 what now

  bill

  yeah

  bill he repeated for the third
time dont let me down you had
a mother once and if you werent bald
youd have snowy locks like mine bill
dont leave me alone with a daughter
thats goin to marry a whangdoodle
with the whangdoodle aforesaid an
with a lot of holiday-makin help that
knows tve had somethin put over
 me

  what can i do about it

  you can put a coat on said the
poor parent pawing my sleeve des-
perately an ill put the saddle on your

hawse for you bill an shine your boots
up for you an then you can come
on over an sort of hold my hand at the
picnic

  no

  bill

  no

  because i am a poor old good-na-
tured fool i went and stayed although
i found the picnic being held in the
absolute dampest most rheumatic part
of the diamond b a kind of rich green
basin on the shores of blue creek it
was always flooded in the wintertime
and in the summer gave off what you
might call a cold steam but it had
picturesque trees around it and alice
had never had a days sickness in her
life so that was the spot selected
simon and i came into it without at-
tracting any attention save a dirty look
from bleachmantle and seated our-
selves  two live-oak stumps while
alice and some eighteen helpers each
possessing two left hands got busy lay-
ing the cloth

  simon regarded this much as i have
seen guys watch other guys putting up
gallows theyre gonna start eatin
now said he hoarsely an its after
the sardine course that ive got to do my
bit bill do you think itd be any use
pretendin that im not her father at
all an that you are me havin adopted
her to cheer up the lonely ranch an
you make the speech 

  evidently the guy was losing his
grip not to say his reason

  brace up said i sternly look
around you stop perspiring this is
your ranch these trees that creek
this swamp were sittin in are all your

property you-

  im goin to have it drained if
driggsll stay with me after this said
simon striving gallantly to follow my
lead and get his feet down to earth
honest bill the way that boy digs

ditches-

 whats his method  t asked


western story magazine

brightly seeing his eyes begin to giaze
again

  why he takes a crowbar first hav-
in laid out the line of where he wants
the ditch said simon an he goes all
along this line makin holes about eight-
een inches deep an about two feet
apart or it might be three or some-
thing then he puts a chunk of dyna-
mite in each hole without any fuse to
it an tamps the earth down thoroughly
then he lays out the line of where he
wants the ditch to go an he takes a

crowbar an he-

  what again i asked

  simon passed his hand over his brow
excuse me he said i dont feel so
good no after hes got all the holes
filled with dynamite he goes off to the
end of the line an fires the last stick
in the usual way that sets off the one
next to it and that one fires the next
an so on all down the line

  dad called alice from the center
of the valley

  yes my dear

  all ready come and sit down
needless to say i would sooner have
remained on that comparatively dry
stump even at the cost of missing the
indigestibles but i couldnt resist old
bridges piteous look as he obeyed 
stumped over my peg leg sinking deep
into the soft earth at every step and
took my place beside him

  we were just like one big blithering
family alice had brought out the big-
gest tablecloth from the ranch house
and laid it on a nice level spot the
party was seated around it about six
to a side alice and bleachmantle op-
posite from simon and me from the
way merry badinage flew hither and
yon youd have sworn those punchers
were delighted to find themselves ac-
tually eating in the open air the first
thing on the bill was salted nuts which
neither simon nor me could touch our
teeth being too far apart the second
was ham sandwiches which might have

been useful for looking at eclipses
through but which were incapable of
supplying nutriment in lots of less than
one thousand the third item was dev-
iled eggs and i can only say that
simons language must have made em
feel at home his doctor having forbid-
den him pepper and alice having de-
prived him of his lunch that day
probably to make his voice clearer the
sardines were due to come next but
neither of us was going to eat them
i-because i knew how long theyd been
in stock and simon--because i nudged
him

  meanwhile ginger ale was passed in
foaming beakers to see the assem-
blage quaffing and calling out skoll
santysaluda prosit and
all those sacred words over a mess like
that made me feel worse than the eggs
had

  bill said simon in a low tone
balancing his glass on his palm and
watching alice start to serve the fatal
fish

  yeah

  sssssh could you do with a stick
in this

  a what asked i joy making me
incredulous

  a bone said mr bridges a
fish two fingers of bourbon ive
got a flask

  i put my glass down where he could
reach it conveniently pulled up the
tablecloth before me so as to form some
kind of protection from spies on one
side leaned forward to block off in-
quisitiveness from the other and told
my dear old friend not to waste time on
foolish talk but to go ahead and pour

  he was just reaching for his hip
pocket when having eaten her first
sardine alice spoke

  father

  the poor guy paused in midreach
paralyzed yes darling said he in
a feeble voice

  the girl made no further speech but
thats funny



confined herself to a motion of the
hand the motion was upward and
the order it conveyed was that simon
should forthright rise to his feet and
announce

  hooray said tom lear sticking
a sandwich in his mouth like a pirates
dagger and starting the applause
fpeef fom mifter vrizhest fpeef
fpeef

  speech yelled all the other asses

  slowly and wearily the wretched gen-
tleman hoisted himself into a perpen-
dicular situation gents said he-
and stopped

  of course he aimed to go on again
the stop was merely temporary his emo-
tions having proved too much for him
or his adams apple having come loose
and dropped into his lungs or some
such thing what i want to point out
is that the accidental stop saved the
day turned defeat into victory and gen-
erally was a darned good thing for
everybody this teaches us always to
stop before we say anything and if
possible not to start again

  simon never started again-at least
not on the subject of his daughters
engagement to mr aubrey bleachman-
tle before he could get his vocal ma-
chinery back into order something
happened to distract the thoughts of
all present from such worldlinesses as
marrying and giving in marriage i
will not ask the reader to guess what
it was because though i was right on
the spot and more or less thinking
about such matters it was some frac-
tions of a second before i myself could
diagnose what was happening

chapter v

the interruption

rphe demonstration started with a
most peculiar muffled thump some
distance away-a half mile at least as
it turned out over the lip of the valley
and behind several thickets of trees

following the thump there was a sharp
popping noise several times repeated
then a couple more thuds slighter than
the first then a sort of heavy tearing
sound which appeared to be getting
nearer and nearer

  simon was already on his feet of
course at this according to my rule
when startled i scrambled up myself
side by side we turned and looked to-
ward the source of these peculiar noises
and within the space of ten seconds
witnessed a sight more peculiar than
the sounds simons hair abandoned
all pretense of dignity and stood bolt
upright instantly i felt my own heart
bump for lo and behold over the lip
of the valley with a loud roar there
shot a three-foot wide furrow in the
green grass which furrow extended it-
self as though driven by an invisible
express plow straight toward the spot
where the picnic cloth was laid

  look out i cried leaping about
six yards sidewise

  id scarcely uttered the words when
cloth food ginger ale and everything
shot up into the air clods of turf
also ascended so did rocks hats gun
belts that had been laid aside coats
neckerchiefs and all sorts of personal
property where these articles had
been there yawned before our aston-
ished eyes a trench about two feet deep
extending to the edge of blue creek

  dynamite shrieked old simon
bridges in a high hysterical voice

  and at that moment danny driggs
rode cheerfully into the valley to see
whether his drainage ditch had dug it-
self all right of course the boy was
perfectly innocent he had discussed the
drainage of that very spot with simon
several days before not being invited
to the party he hadnt been told where
it was to be held

  being a sane sensible sort of lad
when not laughing i dont suppose hed
ever thought that folks might go ahead
and eat in a marsh no matter how green


western story magazine

its grass was or how tall its trees
he had spent all morning boring his
crowbar holes and putting in his dyna-
mite  hed gone off and had his lunch
and then hed returned and touched off
the end stick as per schedule if in the
meantime somebody had gone and
camped right on his blasting line it
was no fault of his

  i could see this quite clearly but
then i hadnt happened to be standing
in a miscellaneous shower of foodstuffs
the way old simon bridges had if
there is one thing that makes for hasty
injustice more than another it is the
receipt of a can or two of sardines and
tomato sauce right on top of the head
various other members of the betrothal
party had got in the way of the falling
viands but simon as if to make up
for his failure to eat had come out
way ahead of everybody else there
was a long lithe pickled cucumber
perched behind his right ear like a pen
the concussion had smashed his pocket
flask so that he smelled like a barroom
a pound or so of deviled eggs had been
plastered on his waistcoat like a bouquet
of dahlias his hair was full of tomatoes
and his face was one solid mass of fish
scales while a sardines backbone
drooped gracefully over his right eye
it was impossible that within three sec-
onds of the catastrophe he should have
had time to take a complete inventory
of how foolish he looked but he was
as mad as he could be anyhow in
fact when danny driggs arrived and
dismounted before him he gave the only
perfect imitation of a cougar i have
ever really heard from any human
throat

  im-im terribly sorry said dis-
mal dannv opening his mouth slightly
and sinking his fine white teeth into his
lower lip

  sorry screamed old simon satis-
fied with the correctness of his cougar
call sorry

  it was a great mistake for danny

to have tried to answer because he had
to stop biting his lip

  yes said he-and gave a chuckle

  he made a brave attempt to chew
himself some more but by this time
his mouth was wide open and try as he
would he couldnt get it shut he
started to laugh he commenced to bel-
low he howled and he roared and
in the middle of that circle of his
would-be murderers he continued to
laugh bellow howl and roar until sir
aubrey bleachmantle tearing off an
oath which i personally didnt consider
nice with a lady present walked over
and gave him a forceful and resound-
ing kick

  take that said mr bleachmantle
you blank blank giggling asterisk
you

  even so dismal dannys convulsions
didnt entirely come to an end he
turned deadly white and he stopped
laughing in the proper sense of the
word but as he turned to face bleach-
mantle he was still making queer
sounds and his shoulders were shaking

  you and your blankety dynamite
you fool cried out aubrey getting his
feet ready for an encore

  dont you-do that-again gasped
dismal danny

  no and why not huh

  because ill kill you stone dead if
you do mr driggs chortled ladies
or no ladies present-tee-hee ho-
hoo

  instantly a revolver appeared in
bleachmantles hand which was very
bad form first because nobody had
made as though to pull on him sec-
ondly because he must have sat down
to table armed which isnt done by
gentlemen i was getting ready to shoot
him neatly through the wrist the mo-
ment he carried out his evident intention
of kicking danny again at the guns
point but i was saved the trouble

  alice bridges suddenly sprang for-
ward smacked her almost-affianced a
thats funny



ringer on each cheek tore the gun out
of his hand and before anybody really
knew what had happened flung the
weapon into the creek

  there you miserable cowardly
bully she exclaimed turning white
and red by turns now turn around
and get out of here and never let me
see your face again thats the way
you act when you think youre top dog
is it get out you gun-toting black-
guard get out

 alice- began bleachmantle

looking fairly sick

  get out ordered the girl obviously
looking around for a quirt

  the gentleman seemed to think it
might be well to obey her it was as
well too because i stood ready to ar-
rest him for the unwarranted display
of a deadly weapon and to hold him
at least four days without bail-the
place of detention being the three pines
railroad tool house which lacks cush-
ions this solace was denied me pie
knew only too well when he was licked
with a speaking glance at simon who
was too furious to notice it he left
the circle got his horse from behind
a copse and rode away

  and now cried old bridges as
though suddenly uncorked you get
your nag young man and get out like-
wise

  father cried alice stamping her
foot it was only an accident it
wasnt mr driggs fault

  was it an accident he stood there
and screamed with laughter at me-his
boss-his employer shouted simon
tearing the sprats backbone off his eye-
brow and hurling it on the ground
was that an accident

  you know he cant help his sense of
humor cried the girl you saw what
happened when  tore my dress the

other day and-

 nemmine what happened nem-
mine the other day let him take his
hawse and get off my land while hes

safe i dont want any killin or any
unpleasantness whatever let him get
out quick

  father her tone was the identi-
cal one that had subdued the old man
on many a previous occasion but this
time he was impervious to anything
short of more dynamite

  silence girl he commanded ac-
tually as though he expected to be
obeyed you feller take your hawse
in place of any salary i owe you an
be out of here before i count ten oi-
lll have you thrown off one two

three-

  hed have had a job of getting the
throwing done unless he was ready to
do it himself because by the time hed
got as far as five all the surrounding
punchers had sort of slipped away into
the bushes where they appeared to be
lying down and trying to look like dead
leaves but his bluff wasnt called

  thank you miss alice said dis-
mal danny looking at her sadly but
never mind ill go hope ill see you
again soon

  i think she said yes but i cant be
sure on account of old simons having
abandoned his counting to cry

  you try it thats all get out i
tell you get out

  all right said mr driggs still
gazing at miss bridges

  with that as they say in the movies
he swung lightly to the saddle of his
faithful pinto and took his lonely trail
toward the setting sun

  plowever he never got there being
overtaken by night a cold wind a rain-
storm and other vagaries of the texas
climate just when he was in sight of
the illuminated windows of tanglefoot
ranch of which he had never heard

  the real name of the place was not
tanglefoot ranch at all but the hog-
pen o meaning quinlan-old thaddeus
m quinlan its owner the nickname
merely referred to the fact that every
square foot of the several thousand


western story magazine

acres was overgrown with loco weed
cactus and similar evidences of ne-
glect coyly mingled with wire from
the fallen fences

  thaddeus in addition to being a mil-
lionaire several times over owing to his
purchase of oil-bearing cattle lands in
sonora was what might be called eccen-
tric he had quarreled with everybody
in the neighborhood including his mil-
lionaire son now living in chicago
for the last ten years he had lived all
alone on this beautiful ranch of his
refusing either to raise beeves himself
or to sell the land to somebody that
would once when asked why he paid
taxes on half a county since half an
acre was more than he needed to live
on he had replied that some day he
might feel like taking a long horseback
ride or something and he could do it
on his own land

  that was the kind of hairpin im-
personated by t m quinlan esquire
i dont suppose that until dismal
danny driggs knocked on his front
door he had had a visitor in ten years
barring book agents new to the terri-
tory it was so long since id heard
of the old man or thought of him either
that when danny mentioned his name
on the tuesday following the picnic
it took me several seconds to recollect
any such person i must admit how-
ever that my mind was somewhat dis-
tracted at the time by the acute rheu-
matism which confined me to my chair
and by speculations as to what danny
might be doing all dolled up in a swal-
lowtail coat and desirous of buying a
ticket to lone star

  mr quinlan lent it to me said the
transmogrified exile he said it would
make a better impression at the bank

  what i inquired of him are you
aiming to do with a bank anyhow

  ah that said danny taking oft
the swallowtail folding it neatly and
sitting down near me is a long story
mr garfield which with your permis-

sion i will narrate while i massage your
aching joints ive got fifteen minutes
before train time i should have
thought your deputy might have
dropped in to help you

  hes out on-er-business said i
wondering whether jake had caught
the train robbers or whether they had
caught him but if you insist on being
so kind theres a bottle of bortlecogs
royal indian anti-pain specific on the
second shelf up thats it aaaaaaah
thats right-just lie back and
luxuriate said dismal danny with a
tenderness i should never have ex-
pected from anybody capable of his
laugh well mr garfield no doubt
youve been wondering where ive been
at these last few days i half figured
youd be dragging the local rivers for
my corpse an i dont mind admittin
i was in a low frame of mind when i
left the diamond b that day

  the memory of that wet grass made
me groan

  yeah said dismal dan soothingly
thats just how i felt until about eleven
oclock that same night ridin all the
time without earin where i got to
then i found myself all hungry an
wet an cold an the hawse likewise
just as a lighted window appeared on
the horizon well mr garfield i
made a line for that window an i
knocked on the door an when this
mr thaddeus quinlan opened it for
me i asked him if he could oblige a
poor wanderer with some coffee and a
place to sleep

  well mr garfield what do you
think happened next the old gentle-
man says come in kind of sulkylike
and right then and there while i stood
in the middle of his livin room and
dripped he looked me in the middle of
the eyeball and says it seems that once
upon a time there were two irishmen

named pat and mike- if youll

believe me before he put the coffee on
or asked me to run my nag into the
thats funny



corral he went ahead and told me that
joke about the two harps that got on
the train

 i know-i know  i protested
dont tell me that chestnut again

  it is kind of ancient said dismal
danny but do you know mr gar-
field the idea of him startin off to tell
stories under the circumstances me
soaked to the skin an shiverin an a
total stranger it struck me so funny
that i had to laugh i didnt want to
especially in view of the misfortunes
it brought down upon me in the past
but i couldnt help it i just stood there
an shrieked the old jasper stared
at me so kind of astonished and pleased
that he made me laugh harder than
before finally he got sort of worried
and told me to stop it but i couldnt
then he seemed to get an idea i was
kiddin him an made as though to turn
me out into the night but you know
how i am when im started

  you bet i do

  well said dismal danny sort of
calmed down by my tone of voice to
make a long story short me and the
old gentleman got real chummy before
the night was over we had a fire built
up an my pony was filled with oats
an we had five or six pots of coffee
and some egg sandwiches an in the
intervals of humor we talked about
pretty near everything under the sun
includin my griefs over at the dia-
mond b i never knew a guy so sym-
pathetic finally as we were goin to
bed he laid his hand on my shoulder
and he says

   my boy the first thing for you to
do is to get to see that girl-quick
if she thinks youre obeyin her fath-
ers order to stay away shell never
forgive you so to make a long story
short mr garfield i rode over the
next night about twelve thirty or one
an threw gravel on alices window un-
til she opened it and we had a nice
little talk though t wished she hadnt

been so high up in the air i had to
talk kind of loud and that woke up her
dad

  what happened i demanded
why nothing said dismal danny
except that he thought i was some-
where i wasnt an fired both barrels of
a ten-bore into his chicken coop hon-
est bill i was sorry considerin the
pride he takes in them blue-ribbon birds
but as i rode away i had to laugh
ill bet you did well what next
well alice had told me before this
here unpleasant interruption that the
peg her pa was hangin all this wrath
an tarnation on was my bein a plain
common or ordinary cow hand she
said he refused to admit that he hadnt
liked the sardines but that hed always

said his girl should marry-

  its true too

  yeah well of course mr quinlan
was sittin up when i got back an he
wanted to know all about what had hap-
pened when i told him addin this
about mr bridges alleged objection to
me what do you think he up and said
probably tag youre it  i re-
plied having no taste for conundrums

  no said dismal danny he just
looked at me and he said well if
thats all thats bitin the old fool well
soon make a ranch owner out of you
you just give me ten thousand bucks
an ill give you title to this place an
you can pay me the rest as you
earn it 

  whaaat  i cried waking up sud-
denly for the hogpen q on such terms
as that was a gift for the gods

  yeah said dismal danny thats
what i said too then i remembered
that i didnt have any ten thousand or
any means of gettin it so i told him
but he says oh tush any banker in
lone star will lend you the money
when he knows what youre goin to
get with it run into town to-morrow
dressed up like a scarecrow in some oi
my go-to-meetin clothes theyll


western story magazine

slather money on you well bill-
mr garfield-thats where im goin
now an if im not mistaken theres
the train whistlin for geogehans
crossing

  b-b-b-but i stammered kind of
dazed by this story whats gonna be-
come of old thaddeus 

  why hes goin to live with his son
in chicago replied mr driggs putting
on his coat he said the boyd been
writin him to conic for a long time past
but that hed got kind of soured on hu-
manity on account of never meetin
anybody with a sense of humor he
mentioned you mr garfield sayin that
youd fired a revolver at him in 
for askin you that wheeze about what
animal is it that starts on four legs
continues on two and ends up on
three

  it may be so i muttered having
been sixty in the year mentioned and
sensitive on the subject but say lis-
ten danny-

  yes said he taking his ticket from
the rack paying for it and giving him-
self change

  have you ever had any doings with
bankers

 no but-

  well  have an i want to tell you
somethin boy you dont want to
reckon a banker as an ordinary human
bein theyre different you mark my
words even if you do miss the train
this unfortunate habit of yours now-
laughin youve got by with it pretty
well around here because most of us
crack an occasional chuckle ourselves
an we know what it feels like but
you try it on a banker an youre goin
to get into trouble bankers never
laugh anybody above the rank of
cashier caught smilin durin business
hours is at once arrested on suspicion
of embezzlement an the bank is closed
by order of the state inspector are
you listenin to me now youve got

the bang-tailed coat mind you live up
to it

  but how gasped the applicant for
a loan staring at me in horror

  if you cant do anythin else i
said as the train clanked into the sta-
tion and stopped pretend that whoever
it is you love best is dead dead dead
an that youre wearin the coat to her
funeral

  he turned white as a ghost but said
he would do just that then he bolted
from the store and just swung aboard
the last car as it departed

ing been in laredo that day i cant

scene tuesday afternoon of a disgraceful
fracas as a result of which mr samuel crow-
ley genial president of the hoof and horn
third national bank city is confined at his
home with a severe headache j d williams
able paying teller of the same well-known
institution is at work suffering from bites
james bull klingenthal the stalwart door-
keeper of the bank is exhibiting to his in-
timate friends a large bruise of blue-green
coloration four and a quarter inches in diam-
eter and seventeen other citizens are nursing
cuts scratches and lacerations

  a statement issued by the bank recounts
that about  p m shortly after mr crow-
ley had returned from his lunch his office
was entered by a tall and powerfully built
individual wearing an old-fashioned swallow-
tail coat but marked by his bowlegs as a
cowman he had a scar over one eye and
was noticeable for his expression of extreme
thats funny



melancholy seating himself at mr crow-
leys desk and introducing himself by a name
which the genial president permitted to slip
his mind in the ensuing excitement the stran-
ger asked for a loan of ten thousand dollars
stating that if convenient he would take the
money with him at once questioned further
by mr crowley who at once began to en-
tertain suspicions of the visitors sanity the
man told a confused story about the purchase
of a ranch in hurst county and stated that
if mr crowley would have the cash brought
at once he would be able to catch the two
twenty train home

  convinced by this time that he had to do
with a dangerous maniac the courageous finan-
cier pretended to be in deep thought and as
is his habit during periods of perplexity be-
gan to draw his right forefinger across the
bridge of his nose as though playing the vio-
lin a fewr seconds later he observed that
the stranger was apparently on the verge of
a burst of unreasonable laughter but before
he could say anything to take advantage of
this condition the man laid his head down
upon mr crowleys genuine mahogany desk
and commenced to weep

  keeping his head in spite of these remark-
able events the local financial genius pressed
the  push button connecting him with the
banks watchman james bull klingenthal and
upon arrival of this well-known and justly
popular and respected officer indicated that
the unwelcome visitor should- be thrown out
however by this time the maniac had recov-
ered from his emotional crisis and when mr
klingenthal inserted hands in his coat collar
and waist band as a means of inducing him
to leave he turned and administered a severe
kick to the officer causing the latter to fall
down

  turning to mr crowley the madman then
commenced a speech to the effect that he
would take his custom to another bank but
noticing that the president had drawn a twenty-
five caliber automatic pistol from his desk
drawer he instantly sprang forward and struck
him over the head with a plate-glass fountain-
pen stand as advertised on page  of this
weeks longhorn which had been presented to
mr crowley by a maiden aunt the previous
christmas falling on the floor the genial
financier attracted the attention of paying
teller williams and twelve or fourteen de-
positors who happened to be in the bank at
the time all rushed gallantly at the stranger
who was now standing in the middle of the
office breathing heavily through his nose no
detailed account is available of the melee
which followed but according to the statement
of elmer ivrack   eighth street city

when picked up on the other side of the road
suffering from nasal hemorrhage and shock
the strangers method of dealing with his ad-
versaries was to pick them up and pelt one
with the other

  after some minutes of this a telephone
call was sent in for the fire brigade this call
being passed through the city exchange at
 by operator dorothy hatchberry who as
many of our readers will remember won the
first prize for local beauty at the recent live-
stock show the gallant boys in buttons had
scarcely received the call to duty before they
arrived at the bank building with hose ready
for immediate action but by this time the
pugnacious stranger had left the bank and
made good his escape he has not yet been
apprehended though when seen by a longhorn
representative yesterday sam bonney city
marshal stated that he was in possession of
a clew

  before returning to its barracks the fire
brigade gave an exhibition of its prowess
with the hand engine the maximum length of
jet attained being  feet v inches

  well the mysterious stranger had
made good his escape by the very sim-
ple process of rushing down to the
depot and boarding the two twenty
train which hed told that bank presi-
dent he wanted to catch in the first
place he got in to three pines on
this train at  p m according to
schedule and-

  now fm up a creek again for the
reason that a long lifetime of collecting
giving and acting upon evidence has
made me wary of stating anything i
didnt actually witness myself being
of course pinned by rheumatism in my
chair at three pines while dismal
danny was on the two twenty from
lone star i wasnt present during
most of the next and concluding act
of this drama i guess it will be neces-
sary to carry on the yarn by writing
here what danny told me later

  this same two twenty-but on sat-
urdays only whereas this was tues-
day-had the honor of hauling the pay
car to the dead mans gulch construc-
tion workers on other days such as
this it consisted of one locomotive one
tender one baggage car and about three


western story magazine

day coaches and it stopped at every
place imaginable by the mind of man
even i never in any hurry to get to
lone star when i have to go there or
back to three pines either-i really
find that train almost too much for my
nerves

  as the lone star longhorn has so
clearly hinted danny driggs didnt
have time to do any shopping for books
or even to buy a magazine from the
butcher who knows better than to ac-
company the train so naturally with
all this excitement and disappointment
fresh in his mind the boy began to
fidget according to his own statement
he held out pretty good until the train
had been on its way half an hour cov-
ering twelve miles and making seven
stops most of them seemingly in the
midst of the boundless prairie then
he had a drink of water he put the
window down then he put it up again
tried the blind in several different posi-
tions changed his seat started con-
versation with some guy and finally
started to walk up and down the train
from one end to the other dismal
danny was wondering how they let a
homicidal lunatic like crowley be presi-
dent of a bank and brooding over the
problem of saving ten thousand bills out
of a maximum earning capacity of forty
a month

  lie was wrestling with this question
in a corner of one of the vestibules
when he observed that he wasnt alone
in the corridor-walkers club two
other jaspers were tramping around
scowling at the scenery as it crawled
past asking the conductor the names
of the various stops and how far to
the next examining the air-brake
valves et cetera et cetera as though
similarly bored to death

  it struck danny that a little con-
versation might be good for the current
ailment when one of these individ-
uals approached where he was standing
le piped up and observed that the

weather looked like continuing fine
provided that it didnt rain it was a
harmless remark as anybody can see
and one that has frequently led to the
most pleaasant of relations as well as
marriage

  the jasper addressed however didnt
seem to care for it according to dan
he said something that might have been
yes no or words even more impolite
and at once walked right away to the
other end of the car as for the other
guy mr driggs took one good slant
at him and decided jiot even to try the
opening of negotiations like so many
of the folks one sees on accommodation
trains the man looked like hed been
born with a grievance against humanity
unlike most he also looked ready and
able to work the grievance off on any
sample of the race that peeped dan
looked at the fellow with respect but
without eagerness as he stated to me
he was feeling kind of low in his mind
and besides he had had enough fighting
for one day

  of course it had to be this identical
savage-looking person specially selected
from among the two hundred and
thirty-five men women children and
dogs on that train who while walking
through dannys vestibule should catch
his foot on the flexible metal strip be-
tween cars make a wild grab at the
air and fall down on the steel floor
in falling he brought his right eye vio-
lently into contact with the toe of mr
driggs boot which seemed to improve
neither his appearance nor his temper
the effect of this latter was in fact so
bad that for some seconds after get-
ting to his feet the injured guy stood
perfectly speechless glaring at danny
with one eye while he held the other
tenderly with his hand it was obvious
that he wanted to pin blame for this
outrage on somebody other than him-
self and after an interval of silence he
got to work doing it

  what the blazes do you think youre
til ats funny



playin at be demanded in a loud
hoarse voice puttin your feet where
im liable to bump into em and fall 
huh 

  agh gasped danny slightly taken
aback

  you heard what i said said the
gentleman taking the hand down from
his eye and rolling it up into a knobby
fist what you mean-

  mr driggs was all for peace being
low in his mind and no hog for per-
sonal combat but the question of what
soft answer to return was taken out
of his hands because at this point he
felt himself starting to laugh he de-
scribed the sensation as resembling the
rising of an elevator in the throat and
says that in this particular case what
touched him off was the thought of
this great two-hundred-pound jasper
crawling cautiously around floors look-
ing for a boot to knock his eye
against

  dismal danny gave one long hoot
and at the same instant had the good
sense to move sidewise thus the fist
of the jasper with the grievance in-
stead of knocking the laugh back where
it came from merely thudded harm-
lessly against the wall of the car-
harmlessly to danny that is this
seemed to cause the peevish citizen both
pain and annoyance the other surly
guy having heard the disturbance was
running down the car crying hey
lay off that stuff jim you dog-gone
fool but his plea was of no avail
jim gave a low roar and launched him-
self at mr driggs whereupon danny
found no course open to him but the
hitting of jim on the jawbone and the
lifting of him to the other side of the
coach

  this punch missed the button the
fallen james drew a large colt from
his jacket pocket and without troubling
to rise or even roll over fired three
shots at dannys calves none of which
took effect this was luckv because

it is not to be supposed that with even
one  bullet in the leg my young
friend would have taken the pleasure
he now did in jumping upward and on-
ward and landing with both his feet
in the firers middle

  danny supposed and rightly that
this- would be the end of jim for the
time being fie also supposed wrongly
that it was the end of the fight but
on turning around he found that the
other jasper who the instant before had
been counseling peace and quietness
was now himself in possession of a gun
and acting as though he intended to
shoot mr driggs in the back only
the poor lads swinging around so sud-
denly and getting a good kick home on
the mans kneecap made the shot go
wide it smashed a glass window val-
ued by the railroad company at four
dollars and thirty-five cents before
another could follow it the gun bad
been pretty completely confiscated and
thrown through the broken pane onto
the tracks

  arthur his new jasper was a much
better fist fighter than jim had ever
been also cooler and in possession of
both his eyes within fifteen seconds
he had turned this into a real advantage
by closing one of dannys eyes after
successively pasting him one on each
cheekbone another flush on the end of
the nose and two roosters to the lower
ribs staggering back from these lat-
ter danny tripped on the fallen james
went to his knees and was only brought
back to life and love by the realization
that this wasnt any exhibition bout
but a regular scrap in which the loser
was extremely liable to be knifed shot
or strangled to death this i need
scarcely say is not usual in texas any
more especially in three pines county
of which i have the honor to be sheriff
and through whose peaceful pastures
the train was now tearing at fourteen
miles an hour while the engineer blew
his whistle loudly for the police

chapter vii

the prisoner

its funny you know but after it

  was all over i remembered hearing
those whistles and paying no attention
to them so interesting was the conver-
sation of alice bridges and so sooth-
ing the effect of her rubbing my wrists
with anti-pain specific as a general
thing ladies dont much care for this
great medicine perhaps owing to its
ability to raise blisters on skins not
used to it including those of horses
but on hearing that dismal danny
driggs had anointed me with the stuff
alice could not be prevented from do-
ing likewise

  do you think hell be back on the
two twenty by any chance uncle bill
asked the girl abandoning all pretense
of having come over to see me and
bending my little finger double in her
eagerness

  tush tush girl i told her in-
dulgently when the excitement had died
down you little know the ways of
high finance probably he wont be
back for days do you think people
walk into banks and walk out again tak-
ing what they happen to need along
with them in a truck not so far
from it

  well i did think so replied alice
defiantly

  you are but a child i murmured
drifting pleasantly toward dreamland

  well child or no child ill bet i
know more about banks than danny
driggs does she said i dont be-
lieve hes ever been in one before to-
day oh dear i do hope he doesnt
get into any trouble just when ive got
such wonderful news for him

  he wont get into any trouble i
said soothingly and in the complete
confidence that i was telling her the
truth certainly he wont get into any
trouble what trouble is there he could
get into

  i dont know said alice

  well then i asked settling myself
comfortably for massage of the left
wrist whats the good news

  she chuckled

  fathers back

  back has he been away

  no when i say back remarked
alice judicially i mean back under
i had to open one eye under
under here said the innocent girl
exhibiting a very pretty pink thumb
you know he got out uncle bill and
acted perfectly awful ft was two days
before he would even stop talking when
i told him to it was only this morn-
ing that i made him say that danny
could come up and visit at the ranch
house whenever he feels like it-thats
the good news but even so he sticks
to saying we cant be married until
dannys owner of a ranch and i dont
believe i can get him to change his
mind

  i should hope not said i being in
the father class myself to put it mildly
and if you do ill ride over and
change it back for him the idea

  there was a silence while she gently
rubbed bortlecogs into my trigger
finger

  well she said softly at last 
hope danny gets the ten thousand dol-
lars soon

  simultaneously the two twenty got
into the station-which is immediately
in back of my store there being no
other buildings within miles-and hon-
estly i dont see how we could have
failed to hear her coming three quarters
of a mile away the engine was blow-
ing its whistle fit to wake the dead
every passenger that could shout was
doing it and those that couldnt were
having a nice long scream car doors
were banging windows were being let
down and over the whole racket the
voice of bud blenkinsop the con-
ductor was roaring for me to come out
and do my duty
thats funny



  cant  i roared back bring it in
to me

  buds a nice boy and he knows me
in addition to being an acquaintance
so he obeyed though the job was evi-
dently distasteful to him for some
reason though he has been  the local
line for years he still thinks punc-
tuality is a virtue and whenever the
two twenty is late he takes it as a
personal insult nevertheless he very
properly escorted whatever it was that
he had in his charge to the middle of
my store floor stood it there right end
up and gave me the necessary particu-
lars about it on examining it care-
fully i perceived it to be dismal danny
driggs

 prisoner for you said bud
double murder well were three
minutes late now good-by

  just as he hurried out the sharp eyes
of love made out what id discovered
some thirty seconds before and alice
bridges gave a piercing shriek

  danny she cried hurling herself
upon it

  he extended his arms and gathered
her to him i dont know where she
found a dry spot to kiss or whether
there was one anyhow they seemed to
me to go ahead and kiss each other for
the better part of five minutes it got
perfectly monotonous and you can bet
i was glad when finally mr driggs
disengaged himself

  and now said he its time for
you to run along home no place for
little girls ive got a couple of men
outside that are much worse chewed
than i am an i dont want you to see
such things im responsible for you
from now on you know sweetheart
you mustdo as i say

  y-y-yes danny said old man
bridges boss b-b-but-did you get
the ten thousand

  the poor kids hed been so sure
of getting it and shed been so sure he
would i tell you when i saw him

swallow a lump in his throat before
answering by golfy i had one with
him

  n-no replied danny not exactly
but itll be all right

  and now youre arrested she
wailed

  it was sellf-defense said danny
and besides alice i told you to go
ill be right over and see you as soon
as i can now its all right just
get your pony and be oft and dont
look behind the store

  she shuddered ill bet they de-
served all they got-and more she
cried fiercely-at me mind you

  never you mind about that said
danny leading her to the door and
kissing her again itll be all right
and the first thing you know well be
all cozy in the hogpen q raisin prize
herefords or somepn good-by
good-by

  good-by

  good-by

  finally they got through with it and
mr driggs got down to the serious
business of his interview with me
well i asked him sternly
well said danny kind of breath-
lessly it aint a double murder at
all events they aint dead and if

they had of been-

  bring em in said i

  he looked at me much in the fashion of
a naughty schoolboy and obeyed first
he went out and brought in one gentle-
man and laid him on the floor and then
he went out and brought in the other
gentleman and laid him on the floor
is this all i inquired

  yes mr-garfield

  then explain said i leaning back
and closing my eyes

  of course i havent any right to hold
inquests and preliminary examinations
of criminals and so on but i generally
hold em for all that and they have
saved me a lot of grief look at this
one for instance i ought to have


western story magazine

locked danny in the tool shed on the
conductors complaint and given the
victims free board and medical atten-
tion until they could appear against him
themselves

  ha-ha

  he had scarcely mentioned the jasp-
ers interest in the vacuum valves be-
fore i got an inkling of something
wrong it grew stronger at the descrip-
tion of the gun pulling and when he
chanced to tell me how the second guy
had shouted to the other to lay off
i took the liberty of interrupting his
narrative

  did you leave any pockets on these
gentlemen i asked without opening
my eyes

  what do you think i was doing
he demanded quite hotly robbing
them 

  if so said i disregarding his im-
petuosity would you be so extremely
obliging as to look through the pockets
in question reporting to me the nature
of any objects found

  you want me to frisk them
even so and i heard him fum-
bling

  heres a jaekknife said he and
a packet of tobacco and two folders
of brown papers and a silver watch

heres a notebook-

  ah yes said i and whats in
the notebook

  papers said he time-table of
the railroad somebodys marked the
two twenty in pencil and written sat
by it heres a map

  we grow warm said i whats
the map of

  looks like--yes by gum its right
around here heres lone star marked
an heres three pines with a star by
it-

  thats me i informed him
  what is

  the star i wear one

  there was silence while he thought
this over then he went on in a kind

of awed voice the map ends at a
place marked dmg whats that
dead mans gulch

  after this i paused and let the sus-
pense ferment a bit as it were dead
mans gulch i added pleasantly is
the destination of the pay car

  there was another silence after
which he suddenly took such a grip of
my most inflamed knee that i had to
yell being averse to the waste of
breath i put the yell to a good use

  go into the kitchen you dog-gone
mass of mud and muscles i shrieked
and read the poster thats stuck up
on the wall

  i heard him lumber across the floor
and shove the door open also noticing
the alteration of his breathing as he
read the concluding lines of the poster
stating the amount of the reward and
where to apply for it then i took a
firm grip of both arms of my chair
thanked heaven i hadnt had new glass
put in the windows yet and waited for
him to start laughing

  honest the situation was such that
i could almost have given a gurgle
myself here was this nice boy after
all the troubles hed had apparently
landed in one afternoon with two reg-
ular knockouts-a failure to raise the
money he needed so badly and an ar-
rest for assault and mayhem and
here it was turning out that the very
thing that had set all his troubles on
him-this here unbridled laughter-had
caused him to earn the money outright
by bringing to justice the very train
robbers that had chased him off no 
in the beginning whether theyd rec-
ognized him and that was why jim
champollion wanted to lay him out or
whether it was just pure accident i
never got to know whichever it was
i expected some little old burst of jubi-
lation and merry laughter believe me

  seconds passed and there was no
howl of mirth from the kitchen more
seconds passed dismal dannys foot-
thats funny

steps returned and stopped by my chair
there were still  chortles finally i
opened my eyes-to find him standing
there staring down at the two uncon-
scious bandits he wasnt unconscious
himself of course but aside from that
there wasnt much to choose between
his condition and his adversaries

  you think theyre the two five-thou-
sand-dollar ones asked danny slowly

  no harm in hopin so anyway i
told him cheerfully

  as it turned out they actually were
-mail robbers and murderers several
times over

  still he didnt burst forth into one
of his well-known explosions though

the facts of the case were quite as well
known to him as to me and better he
didnt give a chuckle even and when
at last he did make a sound can you
imagine what it was

  standing there triumphant and vic-
torious with the hogpen q as good as
his worth a quarter of a million if a
penny with alice bridges as good as
his likewise and worth a whole lot
more than any ranch that ever was
and with all the amusing circumstances
that had made them his fresh in his
humorous mind he looked down at the
faces of the fellows whose capture had
brought him all these things and said

  poor guys

wild animals of north america
the fisher

the swift and agile tisher or pekan is a deadly foe to fish toads frogs
snakes birds and small forest creatures such as rabbits and chipmunks
he is very much at home in trees and leaps nimbly from one to another to
capture squirrels he will even pursue and kill his relative the marten

     a fisher has the characteristic long body and short legs of the weasel family
to which he belongs his coat varies in color from dark brown to black
sometimes there will be gray or grayish-white markings on the animals head
neck and underparts

    although he is so fond of trees that he usually has his den in a hollow
one the fisher likes to roam through dense forests near the water or especially
in winter along wooded ridges he will hunt out traps and eat both bait and
captured animal and despite the quills of the porcupine he does not hesitate
to attack this animal which he finds very palatable

    like that of most wild animals the range of the fisher is no longer so
extensive as once it was but he may still be found in the mountains of new
york state vermont and maine westward from maine and southern labrador
to the pacific coast and north to the great slave lake

    the young of the fisher which as a rule numbers two or three are born
in spring and early in life begin to accompany their mother in her perambulations
depending on her protection until they are almost adult a large-sized pekan
will sometimes weigh eighteen or twenty pounds and be from three to three and
a half feet long but the average animal is much smaller than this

hue to being ruined at the race track dick rutherford the colonel leaves virginia to seek his
fortunes in the west he breaks his engagement to martha farnsworth though both still love
each other and takes leave of his slaves with misery in his heart

    with him on the overland-horseback tour is christy deever a twelve-year-old boy whose knowl-
edge of horses and loyalty has endeared him to the young colonel

    after their encounter with hears the boy feels the presence of some unseen person a rifle
shot eventually proclaims the presence of an indian at whom the colonel shoots

chapter vii

a great idea

had loaded my own rifle
again by this time but i
didnt want to waste any
time punching holes in
desert air while there was
such a marksman as the
colonel along i swung my gray mare
kitty alongside his horse and passed
him my loaded gun while i took his
emptied one he gave me a nod and
we drove in at that indian from differ-
ent sides

  the indian was hurt by the bullet
and more than half stunned by the fall
from his horse he had hardly done
rolling head over heels when we were
it him and i suppose that his head

must have been spinning like a top
but he wasnt ready to call quits plis
rifle was lost in the grass so he had
pulled out a knife and staggering
around on his hurt leg he waved the
knife and seemed ready to fight until
he dropped

  if i had been the colonel i should
have fired the loaded rifle into the ras-
cal but the colonels way was not
mine when he came up close to the
indian he leveled his rifle then he
waited until the redskins head had
cleared enough to understand what was
happening that required only a mo-
ment then the brave drew himself up
to his height and resigned himself it
was plain that he expected to have the
shot sent home through his heart or
his brain
trail of the stone-that-shines



  plenty of nerve eh said the
colonel

  he shot at us from behind said
i and what wrong had we ever done
him

  how do we know what other whites
have done to him however asked
the colonel and these fellows put
us all under one blanket as i under-
stand it make a sign to him to put
down that knife and surrender

  i did it as clearly as i could after
which the redskir shook his head so
that a ripple ran down through his long
hair by gesture he told us that if
he gave up his knife and surrendered
we would promptly cut his throat at
this the colonel tapped his rifle sig-
nificantly and the indian nodded as
much as to say i am at your mercy
i deserve nothing else i expect noth-
ing else

  what am i to do with the fool
asked the colonel greatly exasperated
he wont surrender and i cant
butcher him like this

  put a slug of lead through his
head i suggested that would be
the best way for everybody colonel
its what he has coming to him

  i dont want to appear on the plains
as a destroyer said the colonel
besides what would we get out of
this man nothing christy not even
information because we couldnt talk
to him in his language

  very well said i it looks as
though hell bleed to death

  the colonel was a great deal moved
curse him said he liell stand
there like a roman and die wont
trust himself to us and wont surren-
der christy we cant go through with
this hes human under his red skin
after all open up the pack and get
some bandages

  i did it and the colonel made me
open a roll of cloth and show the brave
how it would be used to wrap around
his leg and stanch the crimson flow

then mr rutherford drew back
waved to the copper-faced man and
started off across the plains in our ori-
ginal direction i was too staggered to
even argue about the thing all i could
say was that he had now a double rea-
son for wanting to trail us and kill us

  if he were a wolf and not a man
said the colonel he might do as you
say but theyre human these people
i have always found that a bad dog
has been made bad by stupid treatment
and a bad horse is generally owned
by a brute or a fool give them half
a chance and they turn out well and
so christy were going to give this
indian his chance

  youre giving him two chances
said i and i suppose hell have both
of them hanging at his belt before an-
other day has gone by

  the colonel laughed at this but he
wouldnt change his mind and as we
jogged along through the wilderness i
began to wonder what would come of
us-a boy of twelve and a madman like
the colonel thrown out on the prairies
together

  he said to me a little later now
that were getting well into the indian
country we have to decide what were
to do christy

  i admitted that that was true and 
said that i had been wondering for a
long time just what his plans were he
took my breath by replying

  plans havent a plan in the world
my boy not a plan in the world i
know what i have to do but i havent
the slightest idea of how to go about
it you understand why im out here
christy

  i know that you have to make
enough money to go back and marry
miss farnsworth said i

  exactly responded the colonel
thats what i have to do and 
know that in a borderland like this
there is always a good chance for a
fellow with a few wits and steady


western story magazine

nerves my wits arent the best in the
world christy but my nerves are spe-
cially healthy so here we are only
i began to wish that some money-mak-
ing opportunities would show them-
selves  martha cant wait for me for-
ever 

  i have written down these words i
believe exactly as he uttered them and
i believe that this speech should be
carved into stone to stand as an im-
perishable monument of thoughtless-
ness idiots and madmen may have
done such things but i dont think that
any other human with brains ever took
a two-thousand-mile journey with no
better idea of what he would do at the
end of it for my part i would not
walk across a street without a clearer
purpose however the colonel was
the colonel though it strains even my
credulity when i reflect on some of the
things which he did and said

  he watched me with a good deal of
anxiety saying christy you dont
seem to approve

  i was only thinking it over sir
said i

  but said he you must approve
you know because you are the practical
head in this party would never have
dreamed of starting out to make a for-
tune christy without having you
along to show me how to manage the
thing you  must agree with me
christy

  well what could i do matter of
fact i wanted to cry like a nervous girl
but i simply said theres a lot of
money out here there isnt any doubt
about that buffalo hides and such
things all we have to do is to get the
hang of the business

  gold too said the colonel bil-
lions in gold out here in the plains and
the hills eh

  i suppose so said i

  thats it said the colonel rich
land too could make money farm-
ing this land christy take all we

wanted to inclose a hundred miles
square raise wheat confound it this
soil can grow such grass that it would
have to do well with wheat get
twenty bushels to the acre wiihout any
trouble-twenty bushels to the acre
six hundred and forty acres o ke
square mile lets see thats more than
seven thousand-call it seven thousand
bushels even to the square mile say
that we work only a hundred square
miles a hundred times seven thou-
sand-seven hundred thousand bushels
take in more land make it an even
million bushels of first-rate wheat every
year lets see-how much money
would that bring in at present prices

  a whopping big fortune sir said
i youd have to ship that crop out
though

  build rafts float it down the river
right down the river christy thats
the thing wait a minute why not
run up some flour mills along some of
the fast streams yes sir thats it
he clapped his hands together and
could hardly sit on his horse he was
so excited think of that christy
gad but im glad that that idea popped
into my mind plain inspiration
well run up the flour naills and grind
our own wheat turn out the finest
brand of flour that you ever saw old
george knows all about milling flour
and what do you say that we send for
him 

  i didnt laugh no i remembered
that i was out on the prairies with this
man and i felt a long distance from
laughing i can tell you

  well sir said i youd have to
fence in your ground first before you
sent for george

  why fences asked he the in-
dians cant be kept out bv fences
maybe the buffaloes cant either
said i but wed have to try

  buffaloes of course said he
well im glad that i have you along
to remember the little things for me
trail of the stone-tha t-shines



christy but the fences are fixed
ill build strong fences around the
whole hundred square miles eh thats
the thing for us

  well have to buy the posts and the
boards some other place and ship them
here that would cost a good many
thousands i told him

  his face fell a good deal true
said he but wed manage that can
you think of anything else

  it would cost a good deal to bring
men out here for farm work youd
have to pay them for working on a
farm and fighting indians and that sort
of wages comes pretty high you know
then thered be the cost of buying
plows and harrows and scythes and tim-
ber for barns and seed wheat and after
that you can double the price for the
cost of shipping it out here

  the colonel looked so sad that i felt
as though i had stabbed him in the
back

  money is the first necessity said
he at last one can see that well
have to rustle about and get us some
money-through the gold mines-buf-
falo robes-or some such thing when
weve made a handsome stake well turn
it all into our land development pro-
ject eh would you agree to that
christy

  certainly sir said i

  looks absolutely feasible to you
  certainly sir

  matter of fact christy its a great
idea and youll admit it

  certainly sir

  it came on me out of nothing at all
plain inspiration said the colonel
write this day down in red christy
because its the foundation of our for-
tune why lad well be so rich that
youll never regret the years of your
life that ive stolen so selfishly
stolen sir

  do you think that im not aware
every moment went on the colonel
that these are years when you ought

to be in school but here i keep you
slaving for me i am ashamed christy
bitterly ashamed but from the day
that i took you by the neck and you
ran a knife into me-from that day
my dear lad i knew that i would have
to buckle you to me with hoops of
steel i knew that you had the stuff
of which the poet spoke if only i could
bring it to light and i have brought
it to light christy-so much that i keep
putting off the day when i must let
you go

chapter viii

in exchange

at a time like that it was foolish to
argue with him because when he
had fixed his mind on a subject noth-
ing would put him off no one could
explain matters or alter his ideas i
could not say that i hadnt the least
wish to let him go to school-that
i didnt have the money to go to
school unless he sent me-that simply
to live with him was a grand education
-that he had found me a little gutter
rat and made me into a self-respecting
youngster i couldnt say any of those
things because he had his head firmly
fixed among the clouds so i made no
attempt-and he went  working him-
self into a fine misery until evening
when we found a little creek and
camped  the bank of it building our
fire down close to the water where the
blaze of it couldnt be seen at any dis-
tance

  after supper i sat at my watch and
enjoyed the crispness of the pure prai-
rie air and listened to the wind humming
through the grasses on the plains the
water at my feet bubbling and singing
it was all too pleasant i remember
putting my head on my knees for a mo-
ment to close my eyes and rest them
a breathing space

  when i looked up the fire was almost
out and i was stiff from my cramped
position besides i was no longer sit-


western story magazine

ting alone at that fire there was a
shadow on the farther side of it and
now that my wits all rushed back upon
me i reached for the rifle with a gasp
for it was an indian hooded in a buf-
falo robe and looking at me with a
face of stone nothing stirred about
him except the feathers in his hair
bending a little in the breeze

  i thought as first that his calm was
caused by one of two things either
a dozen other braves had surrounded
us and we were in their hands or else
this fellow had already cut the throat
of the colonel and made no account of
a boy like me

  turning my head i gave one swift
glance at the colonel no there he
was with his fine face faintly lighted
from the fire sleeping with a smile like
a child when i looked back to the
indian he raised a hand from beneath
his robe and greeted me with a how
-so soft that it could not possibly
reach the ears of the colonel and dis-
turb his sleep

  i was badly shaken as to nerves i
can tell you i managed to raise my
own hand and whisper how in
return-since that seemed to be the po-
lite thing in the best indian circles for
the moment then i pushed a bit of
brush onto the fire and as the flames
leaped i saw that this chap out of the
night was none other than the very
brave who had attempted to take our
scalps that same day

  he saw that i was filled with wonder
and he smiled a little at me then he
laid a finger on his lips and pointed to
the colonel as much as to say that he
would explain everything if he could
but not when his voice might awaken
the white man his smile had a strange
effect upon me because his features
did not seem made for gentle expres-
sion

  but however much he did not wish
to disturb the colonel i distinctly felt
that this was a time when my com-

panion should be alert all seemed
well but there might be mischief which
a boys mind could not understand so
i spoke a word that brought mr ruth-
erford to his feet

 you will understand that the
colonel was generally so very well
poised and at ease that one rarely saw
him startled beyond control and i
hoped that the sight of the brave might
shock him half as much as it had
shocked me well it was another dis-
appointment for me as he had said
earlier in that same day his nerves
were fairly strong and you would have
thought that the warrior was an old
friend whom he really expected to find
beside his fire when he opened his eyes

  he stepped forward with his hand
extended saying friend a man
from mars could have understood that
word from the gesture and the smile
that went along with it and the brave
took the hand of the colonel with such
energy that i could see the long muscles
quiver and jump along his arm and
how his eyes flashed

  this red warrior was no ordinary
man for copper skin or white skin
there are degrees of manhood and this
fellow was a hero among his kind and
a person of importance as any one
could tell with half an eye he had a
collar of grizzly-bear claws and i had
seen enough of those huge brutes to
respect a fighter who decorated himself
with such gear his clothes were of
the finest deerskin fringed as fine as
silk at the leg and arm seams and the
bead work on his moccasins alone must
have cost the labor of a woman through
a whole winter season his horse
which was now in the background was
one of the usual dumpy hairy beasts
which the indians rode though it might
have possessed extraordinary qualities
for all that we could tell in addition
there was his rifle which was new and
of a good make what was more it
was well-kept and this was an ex-
trail of the stone-that-shines



traordinary feature with an indian as
even such greenhorns as we could tell

  however in spite of such dignity as
this man possessed it warmed my
heart to see the way in which he con-
ducted himself around the colonel
in the first place he caught the word
friend and kept on repeating it over
and over again hitting a little bit closer
to the correct pronunciation eacli time
when he had managed that all the
while smiling and nodding at the big
white man lie got busy in another way

  he went down the edge of the stream
to the pony which he had been riding
and he came back carrying the saddle
which was an extraordinarily good one
out of the saddlebags he brought a
shirt which he had apparently taken
along with him to make himself gaudy
in case of a great occasion arriving
while he was wandering across the prai-
rie he had some other trinkets to-
gether with a hatchet with an edge as
murderously sharp as a razor an old-
fashioned double-barreled pistol which
had a rusted lock that could not pos-
sibly be fired but which he handled
with the greatest reverence and fear
and an excellent hunting knife

  all of this stuff he laid out before us
first throwing plenty of fresh brush on
our fire so that we could have suffi-
cient light to know what he was doing
and if he was a bit grandiloquent in
this he could be forgiven for at the
root of his nature every indian is half
a child

  this was not all when he had gath-
ered everything he possessed except for
a little rope which was twisted around
the head of his pony he stripped him-
self of all of his finery by this time
he had reduced himself to the horse
the rope and a little pouchlike affair
made of the skin of a rabbit and which
we were too ignorant to know was his
medicine bag

here he rested content but not un-
til he had made gestures to show that

he would have given the horse to us
also except that he had a long distance
to go to his home and his leg was
crippled with a wound however the
rest went to the colonel with the
blessings of the donor so far as we
could make out

  i kept waiting for the colonel to
gather in this loot it was a great thing
to see him standing up there the mot
magnificent man that ever walked this
earth as far as my eyes have ever seen
he had his arms folded and his big head
thrown back a little his face was
quite impassive except for a little glint
at the corners of his eyes by which i
knew that he was tremendously pleased
well he might be i thought for here
was almost enough stuff to open a
museum he could go back east and
travel with lectures on this one batch
if he wanted to and make a great deal
more money than he was ever apt to
gather by his visionary western farm

  however i was wrong again he
was a confounded man to decipher
usually he jumped the way that i
didnt expect he waited until the
brave was finished and was about to
leave us then the colonel picked up
the saddle and carried it to the side of
the pony after that he fetched the
stuff that went into the saddlebags
finally he pointed to the clothes of the
red man and indicated that the night
was cold more- than that he in-
dicated the fire the water flowing-
gleaming by our little camp the tall
romantic banks of the stream the
darkness of the night and the glitter of
the stars beyond and having included
the whole universe in his meaning he
took the hand of the redskin and re-
peated the word friend and hts
gesture waved away the rest of creation
and made it of infinitely less value

  i can feel in my old heart now a
echo as it were of the thrill of excite-
ment that jumped in me at that mo-
ment the indian could barely contain

himself there were bright tears in his
eyes his whole body trembled and
his broad breast rose and fell as though
he were in pain

  so far as he was concerned as the
bowlers say it was a ten-strike he
took back his goods and he gave the
colonel his soul in exchange

chapter ix

friend 

you and i could have given back the
indians loot just as well but we
could never have done it as the colonel
did before he ended the material
universe was simply banished and
nothing but human relations remained
to be worth a candle

  after that the warrior sat down by
our fire and we got his name out of
him which was sanjakakokah-with a
meaning which we were to learn later
the colonel then introduced himself
and me and when the poor indian had
tried to stagger through our appella-
tions a few times and failed miserably
mr rutherford suggested the title of
colonel for himself and christy for
me he shortened the name of the
brave to sanja without perceptibly
hurting his feelings

  we found out next that he was hun-
gry-which we could have guessed by
the flatness of his stomach without the
gestures by which he indicated that the
sun had gone around the world twice
since he had eaten the colonel put
me to work cooking and for his part
he looked to the wound of our new
friend the red man had done a very
poor job in bandaging and the wound
was very sore and inflamed but the
colonel was a past master at first aid
and he fixed up the hurt as comfortable
as you please in no time at all

  then we sat back and watched sanja
eat and by the time he had finished
the sky was beginning to turn gray
that didnt bother sanja for when his

stomach was filled he wrapped himself
in his robe and was sound asleep before
you could count ten

  i whispered to the colonel and
asked him what the upshot of this
would be he hardly understood what
i meant but i told him that this man
was certain to ask us to go along with
him to his tribe wherever that might
be and that then we must accompany
him the colonel didnt like the idea
he declared that it would spoil every-
thing to make use of sanja but that
this little affair should remain simply
a pleasant memory with no other ma-
terial results

  that of course was what one could
expect from the colonel but i pointed
out that we had no better destination
if he wanted to make money out of the
prairies he would have to learn prairie
ways and prairie people and that this
was a heaven-given opportunity for us
finally he agreed with me though i
had a hard time of it convincing him
in the end he decided that we would
surely accept the invitation if we got
one

  the sun was well up by this time
and sanja suddenly stood up and
stretched the air was icy cold and
the black water of the creek in the
shadow looked just a bit icier but that
didnt deter sanja he stripped off
his clothes tied up his long black hair
in a handy knot-ridiculously as a
white woman might have done-and
then dived into that stream bandaged
leg and all

  he disappeared while we stood shiv-
ering and he came up halfway across
the stream with a shout then he
turned and came back toward us
frolicking like a child in that cold bath
when he had had enough of it he
climbed out whipped the water from
his body and dressed for the ride as
for his wounded leg you would have
thought that he had never had any
trouble with it in his life and the
trail of the stone-tha t-shines



colonel had to force him to stop for a
new bandage

  after that came the thing which i
had foretold he rode out a little in
front of us and with many gestures
persuaded us to ride repeating
friend friend he indicated a
great number of people as much as
to say that he would take us to a
place where every one would be a friend
to us

  you are a rascally little prophet
said the colonel to me with a smile
and i suppose that well really have to
go along to make this fine fellow
happy

  so off we went and there was a load
off my mind for i felt that now we
were about to make a beginning of
some sort and with the colonels tal-
ents if he wished to make money he
would soon succeed with half a chance
to work his way on the prairies we
went along at a good clip i think we
were traveling for a matter of four
or five days before we came in sight
of the indian town the colonel was
much impressed he pointed out to me
that civilized men would not wander
this distance from their homes through
hostile country equipped with only a
rifle and a horse to make their living
as they went along and i presume that
he was right here was sanjakakokah
cruising about on the plains a hundred
and fifty miles from his base of supplies
but simply hungering for any sort of
adventure and most of all for scalps

  there couldnt have been a better
way to learn the indian language
sanja was perfectly willing to try to
speak our tongue but we insisted on
being pupils while he was the teacher
as a teacher he was the best in the
world his gravity was so colossal that
nothing could shake it for an instant
and our most ridiculous attempts to
pronounce after him some of his gut-
turals and consonantal sounds never
made him so much as smile he was

always encouraging us and telling us
that we spoke so well he could hardly
believe that this was the first time in
fact he was a prime good fellow this
sanja

  fie was hungry to talk and we were
hungry to talk he had a thousand
things to say and we had talked to no
one except ourselves for weeks to-
gether so we chattered away all day
long as we crossed the prairie whiie
sanja enlarged our vocabularies by
leaps and bounds i was never able
in after years to make such progress
with an indian tongue but then our
minds were fresh the first writing
of the prairies was inscribed upon us
by sanjo as upon a slate and we really
made a remarkable bit of progress

  we learned that sanja was a man-
dan that his nation had once been
great in war and in numbers and that
they were still as brave as any people
on ithe plains their enemies-who
were all the other neighboring red-
skins-were constantly pressing back
the mandans and thinning their ranks
until finally the mandans were no
longer of a sufficient strength to rove
across the prairies with men women
and children on the march they
could only send out small war parties
or single scouts like himself to do what
deeds came in their way

  in the meantime the rest of the na-
tion was cooped up in a little city which
the- had built on the edge of a cliff
beside the river where the water and
the rock covered two sides of their
homes and a strong wall guarded the
rest here constantly on their guard
like a cornered wolf which the dogs
dare not close on they kept the sioux
and the rest of the prairie dwellers at
a safe distance they planted corn-
he showed us a handful of the dried
seed much smaller than any corn which
i had seen before-and they gathered
berries sallying out to hunt buffalo
when chance brought a herd within


western story magazine

striking distance of their town on the
whole they lived very happily though
it was plain that sanjakakokah yearned
to be out with his men ranging across
the plains as free as any sioux chief
to hunt down enemies and increase the
number of scalps that hung in his
tepee

  he talked to us about many other
things too and as our vocabularies
swelled we could understand most of
what he said though in a fragmentary
way it seems that he had seen us a
full three or four days before he had
finally attacked us and the second day
of his trailing of us he had almost tried
his hand in picking me off when i
lagged behind in the hope that at the
sound of the shot the big white man
might come hurrying back and be a vic-
tim to a second bullet that was the
day indeed when i had received the
fright we questioned him closely he
swore that i could not have seen him
therefore it must have been a pure
matter of telepathy though not a very
strained one i suppose

  we asked sanja why he had planned
to attack men who had done him no
harm and his answer was beautifully
illuminating to people who were not yet
accustomed to the indian manner of
thought a long time before-how
many years we could not find out since
indians are apt to be a bit inexact in
their chronology-five mandans were
paddling a big canoe down the river
when a sudden burst of rifle fire from
the bank filled the craft with dead and
wounded a party of whites-rascals
no doubt of the blackest kind-had
taken the mandans by surprise but
one of the party a cousin of sanja-
kakokahs had managed to dive over-
board and swim to the farther shore
in spite of a bullet through his body
he reached the mandan town and gave
an account of everything that had hap-
pened before he died therefore as
sanja cheerfully told us since that

moment he had known that it was his
duty to send to the happy hunting
grounds every white man who fell into
his hands this he had done to the
best of his ability having accumulated
two handsome scalps as he assured us

  before he had finished this narra-
tive i looked upon him as merely a
cheerful murderer but the colonel
seemed to have no such feeling toward
him he regarded sanjakakokah with
a calm smile and told him that he un-
derstood the exact feeling of the chief

  this was not all sanja went on to
declare that he had hoped with all his
heart to take both our scalps and that
he had followed us for many days full
of this desire he apologized for his
lack of success and he assured the
colonel that ordinarily he would not
have delayed so long had it not been
that the great spirit who governs all
things had held back his hand against
his own will

  of course that was simply another
way of saying that he had never been
able to come upon an opportunity which
exactly fitted his sense of safety how-
ever the colonel seemed to swallow
the entire yarn and rode on as full of
friendship as ever until in the dis-
tance we made out the mandan village
on the bluff and saw that this stage of
our wanderings had come almost to an
end

chapter x

the village

axhen we stood there on the top of
the rise from which we had our
first view of the mandan town san-
jakakokah stopped his pony for a mo-
ment and laughed softly to himself

  you are happy brother said the
colonel

  how can i be anything other than
happy said the indian i see my
city again it is the most beautiful and
wonderful city in the world other
peoples build their dwellings with the
trail of the stne- hat-shines



skin of buffalo raised on poles bux our
houses are so big and so strong that a
hundred men could stand on the top
of one o them and yet the house will
not fall down and the mandans are
not great in numbers it is true but
they are great wits and they are near
to the spirits of the earth and the air

  i wanted to break out laughing at
this silly speech but the colonel gave
tne a side glance that ripped down to
the quick and sobered me thoroughly

  he said sanja these things that
you tell me come from the mouth of
a man who speaks the truth but i
wish to know more i have heard that
the dakotas and the pawnees and the
cheyennes are very great nations

  i repeat the answer of sanjakakokah
a nearly as we could make it out from
our imperfect knowledge of the lan-
guage at that time

  he said it is very true that the
dakotas pawnees and cheyennes are
great peoples and the comanches in
the south are wonderful with their
horses the crows are a mighty
people also their beautiful hair hangs
to the ground and the tips of it trail
when a chief walks out all of these
are brave and wise nations they are
no braver in battle than the mandans
for the mandans will not become
slaves we will not join one of the
great tribes and become swallowed up
in their numbers because we are proud

  i shall tell you the reason of our
pride when the first man was made
and the first woman they were man-
dans all the other nations of the in-
dians came from that first mandan
and he had a son who had a black
skin that son was the father of all
the negroes he had another son with
a pale skin and that son was the father
of all the white men in the world
therefore because we were the first
people in the world you will see that
we could not let ourselves be taken into
another tribe and lose our names be-

cause the great spirit would be angry
with us

  the colonel listened to all this non-
sense with a face as grave as though
he were hearing the gospel preached
but he said at last i have heard
that the pawnees also say that they
were the first people to be made and
the dakotas say the same thing do
they not claim it sanja

  sanja nodded and smiled with some
contempt these peoples said he
because they have many braves on the
warpath and because they take many
scalps also flatter themselves with lies
as you say but i shall give you this
proof that the mandans are the first
people in the world and the nearest to
the spirits of the air and the earth and
the underwater people also this is
my proof which all men know

  when the buffalo leave these hills
and pass far away we might starve for
the lack of meat because we cannot go
out and hunt at a great distance as the
other nations do for our enemies would
come on us like rivers in the spring
floods and wash us away but since
we cannot chase the buffalo at a dis-
tance we call them back to us with the
buffalo dance sometimes it is very
hard we must make big medicine
and i have seen the dance last for fifty
days and nights but in the end the
buffalo always come he said it with
a childish smile of triumph

  it is a great thing said the
colonel i know of no other people
who could do such a thing

  but we can do a greater thing than
this said the mandan serenely
there are times when it does not rain
for many weeks then the ground be-
comes dry see-it is dry now and
the roots of the corn may wither and
die of thirst then one of our young
men goes and stands on the top of a
house and makes his medicine all day
and if the rain does not come then the
next day another young man goes to
western story magazine

the roof and makes his medicine i have
seen this work kept up for twenty days
but in the end the medicine of some
one among the young braves is strong
enough we see a cloud blow in from
the edge of the sky and after that the
rain falls the corn drinks and the har-
vest is saved since the ground is so
dry it will be strange if they are not
making medicine to bring the rain to
us even now

  there was a certain amount of very
strong logic in all of this even though
i had to choke to keep from laughter
for if people could dance long enough
the buffalo were sure to return to the
grass which they had left and if the
young men of the village could make
medicine long enough one day it was
sure to rain however even i could
see that it would have been very foolish
to attempt to point this out to the chief
he was perfectly satisfied with his
reasoning and the reasoning of his
tribe as for the colonel he showed
nothing but interest he really looked
as though he believed this stuff and
then we started on toward the town

  in the swale beneath the village we
came to the cornfields there were
half a dozen indian women and their
daughters laboring and every stroke of
their hoes made out of the broad
shoulder bones of buffalo raised the
dust they were all white and pow-
dered with the dust also when they
saw us they came as fast as they could
run it was a sight partly horrible and
partly amusing to see one fat old squaw
hobbling along as fast as our horses
trotted shouting questions at sanja
he paid no more attention to these
women and their girls than he might
have paid to the blowing dust which
they raised he simply twitched his
horse to a new course and brought it
into a gallop

  while we were heading toward the
village i crowded kitty close to sir
turpin and called quietly to the

colonel are we going right in with
him now sir wouldnt it be better
to stay at a little distance and have a
parley with the head chief before we
go into what may be a trap

 every man has to take a few
chances said the colonel carelessly
so well ride right on in christy
mind that sanja doesnt see you talk-
ing to me like this or hell think that
we dont trust him and i wouldnt hurt
his feelings for the world

  so we made our entrance into the
town we were sighted from the wall
before we got near the gate and there
was already a fair-sized crowd gathered
as we rode in with sanjakakokah
women and girls and boys rattled
questions at us like hail on a roof as
we pushed our horses through the
gang but sanja kept on now and then
raising his hand and hailing some
friend among the warriors they stood
here and there and each of them gave
a start of curiosity when they saw the
two whites but they wouldnt demean
themselves by babbling questions like
children

  i was busy taking stock of this vil-
lage certainly sanja had been right
when he called their dwellings houses
and not tepees because these were
great round structures which might
house a dozen families at a time and
on one of them just as sanja had
prophesied there was a brave making
his medicine to bring the rain he had
had quite a crowd around him too but
they showed him their backs when we
approached however this fellow had
worked himself into such a lather that
he did not seem to see us even when
sanja stopped and hailed him as the
beaver and wished him good luck in
his medicine making

 

the beaver went right on he was
dressed in the white skins of mountain
sheep fringed with black scalp locks
a very flashy costume and a fiendishly
hot one i suppose for a man standing
trail of the stone-tha t-shines



on the roof of a house under such a
broiling sun as this was heat couldnt
stop him however he had a lance
in one hand and a shield covered with
gaudy daubs of color was in the other
he kept brandishing one or the other
of these at the sky and spouting out a
speech of which we heard a cross sec-
tion i dont think that there was
much else to it he merely stood up
there and repeated the same idea over
and over again all the long day and
the only thing that he varied was his
emphasis which was screaming one
moment and soft as a whisper the next
while the crowd stood about and drank
this talk down like wine

  sun said he i am the beaver
i must have water to drink and water
to swim in therefore do not dry up
the earth do not melt the clouds out
of the sky i know you sun you
are trying to keep back the wind which
is my friend the kind wind has heard
the voice of my medicine it is trying
to blow a good rain to us that will turn
the ground to mud and make the river
as yellow as paint but you sun will
not let it you keep it back with your
heat however you will see that the
wind and my medicine are stronger
than you to-day the rain is coming
the rain is coming i can taste it in
my throat i can smell the big drops
hitting the dust i hear the corn drink-
ing my medicine is not a liar it is
a true medicine and the rain will come
listen to the beaver sun listen to
me wind

  very silly stuff but not so silly to
me as i sat my horse in the dust cloud
of that street and watched the enthu-
siasm of that fellow on the roof he
was a grown man a strapping big one
too he had killed his enemies in
battle-witness the scalp locks with
which he decorated his very clothes
and as i watched him broiling and
shouting and groaning at the sun and
the wind i began to feel that perhaps

  we had come to a place where men
could hold a conversation with the ele-
ments i didnt have long to watch
this scene for sanja pressed ahead and
was suddenly mobbed by three women
and a couple of children

chapter xi

the quail

it was his family the three women

  were his wives and the two children
-a boy and a girl-were his offspring
he had been away from them more
than two months on his long hunt and
i know that he must have been wild
to sit down and talk with them how-
ever that was exactly what he would
not let himself do

  his son-eight or nine years old-
came with a flying leap boosted him-
self using his fathers foot and sat
laughing and shouting on the horse in
front of him it must have made the
heart of sanja jump but he merely
took the youngster by the hair of the
head held him squealing and dangling
and dropped him into the dust almost
under the hoofs of my mare the
mother scooped up her fallen boy with
a scream of fear and shook her fist at
me as i rode past but that example
was enough to hold the others back

 sanja was asking some one if
ompah the head chief was then in the
village a middle-aged man with a
good deal of dignity listened to this
question but before he answered it
he ran his eyes over us that glance
lingered on me just the split part of a
second-about as long- say as it takes
a hunting knife to drive to the handle
then his eye wandered on to the
colonel and began to flame while he
surveyed him there wasnt any doubt
about what he would do to us if he
had the ghost of a ohance this gloomy
chap answered our guide do you
know where the house of harratta may
be found go there for harratta


western story magazine

has a daughter the quail harratta
is gone on the warpath and ompah
makes himself a fool and a woman
waiting for harratta to come back
that he may ask the girl for his wife
tell me rain-by-night said sanja
is it true that ompah has at last de-
cided to take a wife

  it is true said rain-by-night
that ompah will be found making him-
self a thing that even the children in
the city laugh at-waugh

  with a grunt of rage and disgust
he threw an edge of his fine buffalo
robe over his head as though in mourn-
ing and strode past us with a sidewise
thrust from his eyes that glided be-
tween my ribs to my heart once more
he was a gloomy fellow this rain-by-
night and i was glad to be away from
him after he was gone sanjaka-
kokah said

  this is a thing more wonderful than
the absence of rain from the mandans
you have heard what rain-by-night
told me now i tell you that ompah
is a great chief there was never a
greater warrior among the mandans
than this elk he had never taken a
wife he would have nothing to do
with women and other mens wives and
daughters cooked for him and made
his clothes and his robes but he never
had much he is a poor man except
in horses of which he has a great herd
for himself he could have bought the
most beautiful girls in the village to
have for his wives but he would not
take them he wanted a life of peace
when he was in the city he would say
and he preferred doing his fighting
from the back of a horse and against
an enemy of the whole nation how-
ever now it seems that he has lost
his heart i am sorry for ompah but
i am glad for the mandans that we may
have a son to such a great man

  it was doubly impressive to hear
such talk about a chief from another
leader of the tribe as a rule an in-

dian prefers to talk about himself and
he can usually manage to expand his
own exploits to a sufficient volume to
fill the ears of every auditor that he
can gather but when he talks about
another man to praise him it means
that that other man is big medicine
you may be sure

  as we went on down the street san-
jakakokah told us that the quail was
the daughter of a hardy old warrior-
harratta the wolf she was the
prettiest woman that ever was seen on
the prairies and therefore it might be
that ompah had never taken a wife be-
fore because he had not been able to
find one who filled his mind as a mans
wife should

  here we turned through a winding
of the narrow alley and we saw in
front of us one of the queerest pictures
that i ever hope to see in this world
in the entrance to a lodge sat an in-
dian girl who was just as sanja had
said the most beautiful thing that ever
stepped upon the prairie just in front
of her sat a middle-aged warrior en-
gaged in painting her face his own
face was made up in a wild combina-
tion of yellows and reds and grisly
blues so as to make himself attractive
in the eyes of his lady love i suppose
and now he was improving the ouail
as fast as he could

  this was the final touch in his work
of decorating her in the dust beside
him lay three or four lengths of clothes
of various colors which he had evi-
dently tried on her but had not liked
the one which he had finally selected
and gathered around her was yellow
with a blue design and border and
rather a fetching thing it seemed to
me he had put her in this then
he had put half a dozen necklaces
around her throat he had wound
pounds of gaudy beads around her
arms and he had woven quantities of
the finest feathers into her hair

  when we came closer and he turned
trail of the stqne-that-shines



his iace to us i saw one of the harshest
visages ever created he could have
posed for the central figure in a childs
dream of an indian raid but this
monster was so far lost in love that he
actually did not see us we were
simply dim figures moving through the
mist that obsessed him and he turned
his head back to the girl

  she however took more interest in
us a white man was a white man
after all and i suppose that she had
not happened to come across many
whites like the colonel as a matter
of fact he was almost as much of an
exception among white men as she was
among indians but not quite because
the daughter of the wolf was not only
an oddity among indian women-she
would have been an oddity among any
set of women in the world

  christy said the colonel what
a wonderful golden girl she is-if shed
only wipe the old fools paint off her
face

  that was the word for her-golden
i never could find out just what blood
was in her because i never could learn
any details about her mother it may
be that the quail was not of the man-
dan blood at all but carried off from
some border town in a raid it may
be that her mother belonged to the
tribe and had strange blood in her it
may be that she was simply a freak of
nature though of course i cannot help
doubting this

  at any rate her hair and eyes were
very dark but they were not black
they were simply a dusky shade like
the evening and her skin was as far
from copper as it was from white per-
haps youve seen some of the ma-
donnas which the italians painted when
they were half mad with color well
this girl was like one of those golden-
skinned madonnas except that her
color was a bit more shadowy than
anything an italian would put down on
the canvas somewhere ive picked up

the theory that the indians may be de-
scended from the chinese or an ante-
typal race from which both the china-
man and the red man may have evolved
i never could take much stock in that
theory although it might do to explain
the unusual complexion of this girl
she might have been a throwback to
a type that was gone an unknown span
of centuries before

  these big dusky almond-shaped
eyes looked at us with as calm a stare
as any barbarian queen could have de-
livered from a throne then she de-
liberately wiped the streaks of paint
from her face and gave us our first
chance to really see her for my part
i saw enough to understand why
ompah had lost his wits about her

  sanja said go into your house
quail i have to speak to ompah

  speak to him then said this im-
pertinent girl or do i make sanja-
kakokah dumb

  there was a great deal about in-
dians and their ways that i did not
know but t did understand that in-
dian women do what they are told to
do and it chilled my blood a bit to
hear the girl talk in this manner sanja
was so enraged that he even lifted the
whip in his hand as though he was
about to strike her but i suppose
that the presence of the big chief
stopped him at any rate the main
thing was that the girl remained sit-
ting there staring at the colonel

  and the colonel stared back at her
in the meantime ompah pulled him-
self together a little and stood up draw-
ing his robe around him-a whale of
a man he was when he stood up but
his eyes still had a dazed expressior
as he faced us he asked what it was
that sanja wanted and finally he
seemed to make out what had hap-
pened sanja was talking four or five
times faster than i could follow with
my abbreviated understanding of thy
mandan language at that time bui


western story magazine

i understood enough single words and
gestures to make out that the chief was
telling the great war leader how he had
trailed us and tried to lift our scalps
and how he had been followed shot
down and then turned loose with a
gift by this odd giant of a white man

  by degrees the big chief recovered
from his trance and began to under-
stand and when he understood and
came wholly to himself he did all that
we could have asked of him he came
to the colonel and shook hands with
him he said that sanjakakokah was
his brother and that having spared the
life of sanja we had spared his own

  then he led the way to his own
lodge pointed out that there was va-
cant room around its walls and begged
us to stay there with him here sanja
put in to the effect that he could not
allow us to go anywhere except to the
house where he himself lived so that
ompah could only wind up with offer-
ing us the freedom of the town so to
speak and hoping that we would make
them happy by forgetting to leave their
nation after that he began picking
up stuff to give us as a present but
the colonel managed to extricate us
and we went off with sanja sure of one
thing at least that with the protection
of the war chief around us no mandan
would dare to handle us lightly

chapter xii

the music of the night

jje found ourselves that night in a
great hut with a fifty-foot diam-
eter with a pair of beds assigned to us
and plenty of time to stare around at
the strange furnishings of that house
there was a whole circle of these little
bed chambers each fenced in with elk
and buffalo skins and in the four or
five foot space between the beds there
stood a post on which the belongings
of the warrior hung his war club his
ax his headdress his spear his quiver

bow and arrows his strong shield his
medicine bag and top of the post in
every case the head and horns of a
buffalo with a pendant strip of skin and
the tail sweeping the floor those buf-
falo masks stared at me with their hol-
low eyes that night like a circle of
devils

  for half the night i could not dream
of sleeping it wasnt the strange-
ness of the place alone that kept me
awake but my ears were not yet ac-
customed to the noise of an indian vil-
lage i had always imagined indian
towns as places of majestic silence in
the midst of the prairies but i was a
thousand times wrong if there had
been nothing else than the dogs the
town of the mandans would have made
a good study for the noises of hades
for in every family there seemed to
be a score of wolfish starving skulk-
ing brutes and every now and then a
dog in a far corner of the town would
discover something in the wind or
scratch up a buried bone or get into
a fight that would attract the attention
of every other dog in the place the
whole canine population started with a
yelp and tried to pile over to the cen-
ter of attraction in two jumps then
there was a grand turmoil of snarling
screeching and howling as twenty
fights started but before those fights
were settled something was sure to
happen in another corner of the camp
and the whole mob scooted in that di-
rection

  the dogs were not alone as noise
makers however half a dozen young
men felt inclined to have a concert that
evening and unluckily they selected the
roof of the house next to ours for their
show it was a grand affair each
of the young men took turns in sing-
ing the lead the rest of them sat
about beating drums or rattling bones
and moaning out a burden while the fel-
low who was elected to relieve his
spirits for the time being screeched
trail of the stne-that-shines



like a wild cat with a knot tied in its
tail when his throat began to show
signs of wear-another pair of lungs
of brass took up the good work where
he left off

  i kept looking about our own house
ito see how long the grave and staid
warriors would stand for this non-
sense but they paid no attention to it
at all finally the colonel said to
sanja

  the young men have strong voices
sanja

  sanja looked up and appeared to be
hearing that vocal maelstrom for the
first time saying that is white
buffalo and some of his friends and
they are singing because they are to
go on the warpath at the first favorable
time of the moon it is a pleasant thing
to hear the brave young men of the
mandans telling how they will destroy
their enemies and bring home scalps

  even the colonel was a bit stag-
gered by this it sent him off to his
bed and i retired to mine as ive said
before only to lie staring out through
the entrance gap at the leap and glow
of the fire which smoked or burned in
the center of the house i say smoked
or burned advisedly sometimes the
flames jumped up happily toward the
big hole in the center of the roof which
was supposed to serve as a chimney
most of the time it didnt serve as a
chimney at all it wasnt even a par-
tial excuse for one and when the
wind puffed from a certain quarter
great white billows of that smoke
rolled down and back and curled into
the obscurest corners of the house-
including my lungs as i lay there
coughing and trying to breathe it
was not pleasant-smelling smoke either
for anything that can be made to burn
is good enough for a mandans fire i
only thank heaven that they had not
discovered rubber up to that time

  after a while the sextet on the ad-
joining roof got a bit hoarse and went

off to bed but just as i was begin-
ning to give thanks a young brave
came walking into our own lodge
helped himself to a handful of buffalo
meat from the pot that steamed night
and day above the fire and when he
had fortified himself with that broke
into a little impromptu dance circling
around the room ihooting and screech-
ing in such a key that a pain settled in
my brain and began to throb with every
beat of my heart this temporarily in-
sane young man was merely telling how
he had had a good evening gambling
and how he had won two horses and an
old shirt from old pipestem in the
course of the night he yelled himself
out of the house at last and went off
through the town still whooping it up
leaving an echo and an ache in my
mind i actually prayed for the next
dog chorus to begin and drown out the
song of this young gambler

  now however matters quieted down
to such an extent that i could hear the
crying of the baby in our house you
may have noticed that a baby will
usually make itself heard yes time
and paticnce may be required but a
baby has oceans of both qualifications
and a little noise-making art of its own
i have often looked with wonder at a
baby it is a standing proof of the
old doctrine that only a poor workman
casts blame upon his tools for here
is a mite of humanity whose lungs can-
not possibly hold more than a handful
of air and yet which can handle that
bit of air so deftly that it rivals the
best and longest-winded piper that ever
called down the eagles in a highland
glen

  it is not mere volume it is the way
a baby does it that counts first it
establishes a regular rhythm and that
rhythm of crying sinks in on your brain
you adjust yourself to the beat of the
tune as it were and get your nerves
fortified and composed but just as
that happens the baby shifts to an up-


western story magazine

per register and charges on your atten-
tion with an entirely new harmonic
scheme of things take it all in all a
thunderstorm can be a considerable
disturbance but  would back any
three-months baby against the most
ripping thunder that ever deafened the
mountains and shook loose the upper
pinnacles of rock

  a thunderstorm has a comparatively
small register also it cannot help
being rather grand and soul expanding
but the crying of a baby is simply
mean and wicked and acid it wears
out the heart like water dropping on a
stone

  well as i said before there was a
crying baby in that lodge i didnt think
much of it while the sextet was per-
forming on the near-by roofs or while
the young gambler was telling the
world about his good luck but after
those disturbances died away and the
camp reverted to the comparative
silence of the dog fights the snoring
warriors the talking women the crack-
ling fires and the sneezing of smoke-
irritated lungs the baby began to as-
sert itself it had simply been getting
in voice during the first part of the
evening now it tuned up in earnest
and in another ten minutes i was sit-
ting up and gasping and wondering
what could be done to keep the poor
mite from choking to death or would
it not be wiser to put a merciful end
to its misery

  just then the squaw shifted her po-
sition and brought herself into view of
me she was squatting by the fire
with a year-old boy in her lap that
youngster was the one who was using
its voice on the rest of the world it
gave its mother the full benefit of hands
and feet it kicked her beat her
yanked her hair and screamed most
loudly when she dared to remove its
grip from her nose which the boy was
extra fond of pulling the manner in
which the poor squaw absorbed this

punishment and kept on dandling and
stroking and cooing to the youngster
was an amazing thing i was twelve
at that time but i then made a sur-
mise which i have repeated many times
since-that a mother must be almost
equal parts of fool and saint

  presently a buffalo robe was thrust
aside and a tall brave appeared

  now thought i to myself the
boy will get the first spanking of his
young life how i hope that the strong
right arm of that warrior doesnt grow
tired too soon

  no i was entirely wrong this fel-
low who looked ugly enough to
slaughter asleeping city merely squat-
ted on his heels and looked at the little
thing with much painful attention and
affection he seemed delighted when
the boy stopped crying in order to get
a good hold on his fathers ear with
one hand and whack him in the face
with his other fist

  you see said this red-skinned
idiot that even before he can speak
my son knows his father and this
father knows his son he is hungry
that is why he makes such noise

  he reached into the pot of buffalo
meat and gave the baby a whole hand-
ful the child had no sooner swal-
lowed it than he piped up again a
little louder than before but there sat
the pair of them-father and mother-
dandling that devil-inspired youngster
for another hour until it grew tired of
pommeling them at last and fell asleep
in the middle of a screech the mother
was asleep too-poor tired thing-
with her body sagged against one of
the posts which supported the meat
kettle but even in her sleep she was
smiling as though to placate that vei-
ling and wonderful son of hers

  after that i managed to get to sleep
in my turn and i dreamed that i was
an indian father with a whole flock
of children it was a rare bad one
even for a nightmare

a dandy

oerhaps i have allowed you to
have the impression that this was
an exceptional pair of indian parents
but they were the ordinary thing among
the mandans and among all the other
tribes so far as i was ever able to
learn a child is considered to have
its own privileges and these are first
and foremost the right to yell when
it feels so inclined an indian would
never dream of kicking a dog merely
because it was yelling at the moon
neither would he dream of punishing
a child for crying

  in the morning i was a bit groggy
and even the magnificent nerves of the
colonel seemed to have been a bit-
strained by the ordeal of the night be-
fore-not that i intend to infer that
the day was much quieter the dogs
were tireless day or night made no
difference to them their lungs were
simply equal to any and all demands
that could be made upon them the
children were screeching all day long
too and every now and then one of
the braves would be inspired to break
into a dance for no particular reason
prancing around in a circle like a
rooster courting a hen and yelling or
chanting at the top of his lungs

  this comparison struck me that
morning-that indians are like school-
boys who are enjoying a recess the
difference being that the indians never
go to school and always are enjoying
the recess

  sanja was  hand as soon as we
turned out he showed us the best
way down to the river where we all
had a swim and the colonel did his
shaving in the cold water that did not
bother him however for small matters
never weighted on his spirits we
climbed back to the plain above in time
to see an odd performance going on
among the hills

  all the boys who were old enough
to run at a decent clip and keep it up
for any time were drawn out of the
town and split into two parties with a
wise old warrior ait the head of each
band they had play bows and rush
arrows together with wooden knives in
their belts and each youngster had a
little tuft of dried grass on top of his
head to represent a scalp lock after
that they were led through all manner
of maneuvers the two warriors got
their bands into good defensive posi-
tions among the hills and then they
started the two gangs for one another

  they went through all the work of
sham attacks and feints and retreats
setting off the fine points of indian
tactics and in the meantime giving
those boys enough running to kill off
most grown white men finally the
two lines closed that is to say they
came to close range and- began to shoot
off their arrows the moment that an
arrow struck a vital place the victim
had -to drop dead while the lucky
fellow who had shot the arrow ran up
and scalped the dead boy with his
wooden knife the scalp was the tuft
of dead grass which was put into the
belt of the victor and then the young-
ster ran back to help his party as
before

  i thought altogether that it was the
most exhausting game that i could
have imagined and it made me ache to
think of going through such maneu-
vers then when the battle was ended
the whole party trooped back into the
town and we entered with them

  it was a great sight to see the boys
carry on they whooped it up for a
while as though they had really done
great things and what amazed me was
that the grown men stood around and
seemed perfectly serious when they
heard the boys boasting about what
they had done

  the reason for that seriousness was
partly to encourage the boys to fight


western story magazine

and partly to encourage them to talk
for an indian who cannot boast is not
apt to be much considered you must
not think that boasting and lying are
practically synonymous among indians
as they are among whites when an
indian boasts there is always a grain
of truth at the bottom of what he has
to say the art of the speaker is in
making that grain of truth color all his
chatter and the art of the listener
is to be able to tell by the color of the
boast the amount of real fact that is
contained in it so you would see the
older braves listening to these screech-
ing youngsters in turn and going from
the windy ones to those who had
actually done something

  after all this part of the celebration
was only a warming up for what fol-
lowed the boys who had taken scalps
then stepped forward and began a
scalp dance that was fairly blood-curd-
ling for half an hour that dance had
the city ringing then it subsided the
excitement vanished completely but
i could realize in what a manner the
ferocity of these people was trained
and encouraged from their infancy

  after the games of the boys had
ended the colonel and i consulted
about our next best moves and we had
a considerable talk on the subject
when he asked my advice i admitted
frankly that i had no idea how we could
get into a prosperous business by the
means of people like these neither
had the colonel a thought of how to
commence but i felt that this con-
nection we had made with the mandans
was a foothold of some sort and i sug-
gested that we simply wait here in the
town for a time-until we saw the
mandans a bit tired of our company
or until we had a chance to do some-
thing worth while for ourselves

  he agreed to this but he seemed
rather anxious i dreamed all night
about martha farnsworth said the
colonel confound it christy i

havent sent her a letter for a month
or even for more than that and it
is a weight on my mind suppose that
she gives me up for dead and picks up
another man like young gilmore-that
sleek-faced young puppy i worry
about it and we have to turn a trick
of some sort have to get something
out of this money or reputation
christy so look around you and see
what there is ahead of us will you
wake your wits up christy youre
always able to find something

  sometimes it seemed to me a little
unfair that the colonel should put
burdens of this nature and this weight
on my mind but i was fairly used to
it he always came to me when he
was in a corner and i was accustomed
to thinking for the pair of us though
how we were to make capital out of a
lot of poor red-skinned beggars who
had nothing worth while except runt
horses and buffalo skins i could not
tell

  we went down the street together
and sanja came along with us he
proposed that it would be a good idea
to go listen to the medicine that was
being made that day to bring the rain
he said that there was no doubt that
the rain would come the mandan
young men alzvays made medicine
which brought the storm clouds but
this time it seemed an extraordinary
hard job they had used up a great
many of their young men in a vain
effort but none had developed a medi-
cine great enough to make any impres-
sion on the sky-strange to say

  now he understood that a youthful
brave named stone-that-shines had that
day taken post  the roof of the medi-
cine lodge and he had heard that the
brave was making a really heroic effort
to bring down the rain so that it
might be worth our while to go listen
to him and give him our good wishes-
and what could foe better than the good
prayers of such a hero as the colonel 
trail of the ston e-t hat-shines



  we went along with sanja until our
way was blocked by a young man who
rode a horse very slowly before us and
who seemed to me the most beautiful
picture of an indian that i had ever
seen or even dreamed of it was a
piebald horse in the first place and a
perfect beauty with its colors rubbed
up and set off -to perfection the rider
sat on a saddle of beautifully white
mountain-sheep skins saddle and
bridle were a mass of jingling little
brass bells all burnished until they
shone as brightly as they tinkled he
had an elaborate headdress of feathers
and his clothes consisted of a tightly
fitted suit of shining white skins all
covered with beautiful beadwork his
long black hair hung down beneath his
stirrups and as he rode along he cooled
himself by waving a fan of feathers

  what great man is this asked
the colonel softly of sanja

  great man great man said
sanjakakokah his lips curling with dis-
gust ah my friend this is no great
man but a shadow and a disgrace to
the mandan people his father was
d worthy man and my friend if he
were living now he would first use his
knife to stab that rascal in the heart
and let the crows eat his flesh there
is no greatness about him you see
that he has fine clothes and a pretty
appearance but that is his whole
work he does not ride to battle with
the mandans he does not work to
gather game for the meat pots all
that he performs is to make himself
beautiful and to whisper lies to the
women as they are working so that
they may make beadwork for him and
give him food when he comes begging
like the coward and the villain that
he is

  a dandy said the colonel to me
with a smile nothing to do but to
make himself fine oh christy how
i wish that some of the dressy young
men in virginia could be on hand here

to listen to what sanjakakokah has to
say of dandies and dandyism it does
me good to hear him but theres an-
other dandy on the roof of the medi-
cine lodge

   it looked like another beau as a
 matter of fact but when we came a
 little closer and mingled with the crowd
 which was listening to the shouting of
 this youth we could see that there was
 a difference

   for instance the burnished necklet
 which he wore was made of the nar-
 row deadly claws of a mountain lion
 which this brave must have killed in
 battle his shield was beautifully
 whitened to be sure but it was so pon-
 derously made of the thickest hide of
 the buffalos back joined together in
 layers that it looked capable of turn-
 ing a rifle bullet and at the end of
 his lance streamed the scalps of three
 enemies

   this was very apparently a young
 man but it was certain that he was
 an important man already u spite of
 his youth

chapter xiv

the medictne bag

 rphis warrior on the roof of the
 medicine lodge was capering and
 dancing and shouting and crooning a
 good deal as the man of yesterday had
 done yet there was a difference which
 struck even inexpert eyes like those of
 the colonel and myself this brave
 had made himself fine because he was
 going to stand the eye of his nation and
 of his god furthermore he knew
 that the corn was dying in the fields
  and that a famine might follow he
 was not only excited he was desperate
 and religion seemed to give him a
 drunken enthusiasm

   he said hear me wind of the
 southeast hear me clouds of mist
 which are filled with cold water in
 rivers i demand that you hear me and
 i am worthy of being heard because


western story magazine

i stand here to make a sacrifice others
have offered you their best buffalo
robes others have killed for your
sake their favorite dog or even their
fastest horse but  shall do some-
thing more than this hear me wind
and cloud and all my dear people-
unless the rain falls on our city this
day i shall sacrifice myself and this
is how the thing shall be done unless
the rain fall this day i shall take off
this shield i shall throw away my
medicine bag i shall throw down my
rifle and my spear and my knife i shall
creep away and never raise my head
where the warriors boast again i shall
burn my three scalps in honor of the
great father and i shall live among
the women and the dogs this i shall
do unless i draw down the rain but
i shall draw it down i feel the cool-
ness of the shadow of the clouds com-
ing upon my heart do not fear
women who hoe the dust of the corn-
field t shall bring down the cold
showers of the rain this day or else
i shall be a sacrifice

  this was his speech repeated over
and over with a very few variations
throughout the entire day but his
audience didnt mind repetition they
listened with silent enthusiasm and awe
for the thing which the young stone-
that-shines was offering to do was a
good deal more than a threat to com-
mit suicide he declared that he would
condemn himself to a life among the
women and the dogs giving up his
standing as a warrior if he failed to
bring the rain this day the danger
in which he stood from the indians
point of view was that of a sort of
living death

  it impressed the mandans terribly
they grew positively pale when they
heard of this dreadful sacrifice which
the youngster was offering to make
sanja for instance could not look on
the picture after a single glance but
he turned away saying that it made him

sick and weak to think of such a thing
-and such a useful warrior lost to the
not over-thick ranks of the mandan
fighters

  here there was a general murmur of
applause for young stone-that-shines
in the midst of a frantic capering
across the roof suddenly opened his
medicine bag and took out its contents
now a medicine bag is a sort of a sec-
ondary soul to an indian he first goes
out when he is on the verge of man-
hood and sleeping in the midst of the
prairie or on some dangerous buffalo
trail he dreams of an animal which is
then sacred to him it may be a mouse
or a beaver or a toad or a rabbit when
he wakes up from his dream he kills
the first specimen that he can find of
the creature which had appeared to him
in his sleep and with its cured skin
he makes his medicine bag sometimes
it is a huge affair and great inconveni-
ence for a warrior to carry about with
him sometimes it is a tiny skin of a
young frog which can be tucked away
out of sight and never noticed except
in the most careful search of the per-
son of a fallen warrior

  such searches are always made when
a warrior drops a foeman if he can
come out of battle carrying his own
and his enemys medicine bags it is
not only a curiously interesting battle
trophy but also a double soul equip-
ment as one might say it doubles a
mans importance on earth and it
doubles his importance in the shadowy
life hereafter

  once a medicine bag is lost or stolen
or taken in battle it can never be re-
placed the greatest chief in the
whole tribe would not dare to fabri-
cate a new medicine bag to take the
place of one which had been disposed
of but if he can lay hands upon the
medicine bag of an enemy then he is
saved again-and he is able to lift his
head without shame among his fellows

  i have enlarged on the theme of the
trail of the st one - t h a t-shines



medicine bag so much and so long be-
cause i want it to be understood that
an indian fighter would almost as soon
open his heart as open his medicine bag
before the eyes of the world usually
the bag is stuffed with dead dried moss
or some other stuff which is very light
but gives the bag a living shape in
addition it of course holds some mys-
terious element of the spirit world
that is its great importance

  however stone-that-shines opened
his medicine bag before the entire
crowd and with a groan of wonder at his
daring courage and recklessness passed
over the host that watched him he ex-
tended above his head in one hand what
looked to me like a ball of living yellow
fire it looked like a segment of the
blazing sun itself which now poured
down from the center of the sky

  i looked at the colonel and i saw in
his eyes a faint reflection of that same
yellow fire which blazed in the hand of
the warrior it was perfectly easy to
understand how the brave had acquired
his name he had actually found a
stone that shone but my thought was
the colonels thought and the
colonels thought was mine who
could tell if the indian might not have
discovered some wonderful outcropping
of diamonds on the prairies or among
the hills that bordered it

  we crowded as close as we could and
strained our eyes but the instant that
stone-that-shines had finished prancing
in his first direction along the roof of
the medicine lodge and had turned
back toward his first position the blaz-
ing fire died out of the stone which he
held and all that was bright in it was
a few glittering dazzling eyes of fire
whatever it might be it was certain
that it was  jewei-no diamond at
the least

  the colonel having stared his fill at
it suddenly turned around and drew
me out of the crowd asking christy
what can the thing be

  wouldnt i give my eyeteeth to have
a look at it said i but i cant tell
what it is any more than you can it
looked very much like fire to me at
first

  christy said he you may laugh
i know but i tell you that we have our
first sight of the treasure which im go-
ing to find and to take back to virginia
with me where ill marry martha
farnsworth and send you away to
school

  he was beginning to have this dream
right out in the middle ol the day
which wouldnt do it didnt seem
healthy at all

  i said colonel thats  diamond
looked to me like a big chunk of glass
-and thats all

  what cried the colonel there
was something that glittered in that
glass though

  yes some sort of coloring said i
they used to make balls of glass with
sparkling stuff in it when i was back in
virginia youve seen them too and
what that brave has in his hand is
simplv a chunk of one of those broken
balls think

  this took down the colonel a good
deal he complained how could
a grown man be such a fool over a piece
of broken glass christy will you tell
me that

  why i said the indians never go
by the price of a thing beads are just
as good to them as emeralds and rubies
its just the first flash of a thing that
counts with them and so this stone-
that-shines has turned a little broken
glass into big medicine

  and now growled the colonel
he stands on the roof like a perfect
fool and tells the sun to notice the part
of itself which he is holding in his hand
and he is pointing out to the rest of
the tribe that the bit of sun which he
holds does not burn him although it is
hot enough to shine what rot
christy and if theres nothing in the


western story magazine

thing why dont the mandans make a
laughingstock of him

  because partly theyre too polite
said i and partly they really like to
believe in wonderful things

  i think that the colonels feelings
were really badly hurt because i refused
to allow him to make anything wonder-
ful out of this glittering handful which
stone-that-shines had in his medicine
bag

  it was about time for eating we
thought so we stepped into the first
lodge that we came to and helped our-
selves from the pot of buffalo meat
that was the rule for a stranger it
didnt make much difference whether
he was a guest of one man or of an-
other as long as he was a friend of
the tribes he could go to any mans
food supply and take what he wanted-
and welcome too the squaws didnt

and a wrinkled old hag reached into the
meat pot almost elbow deep until she
found a sizable and tender chunk which
she handed to me

  i couldnt refuse i think that i
would have if it hadnt been for the
colonels eye fixed steadily on me with
a good deal of danger in it i had to
take that meat and thank the old squaw
and eat it in front of her eyes other-
wise she would have been insulted
which would have meant an insult to
the lodge which would have been an
insult to every warrior living in that
lodge which gives you an idea of how
indian courtesy worked forward and
backward from- high to low and big to
little

  we were getting out of that lodge
when a bit of misfortune came my way
in the shape of a brave who was just
balancing between boyishness and man-
liness with nothing much to give either
way

scowl at us for invading their larder

they came up grinning and nodding

 author of shorty inherits a ranchec

ltiiough sam canutt
would not have won a
movie contract for looks
-his ears stuck out and
his nose was long his
hands were huge and his
feet oversize-in the saddle he was al-
most graceful his bowlegs fitted his
broncho like a glove and his short
wiry little figure swayed with the move-
ment of his mount as though grown
there born to the cow country one
would have told at a glance now as
he rode into ticote his face was solemn
almost sad save for the droll expres-
sion about the wide mouth the only hint
that he was the little puncher from dry
river known in his own bailiwick as
chucklin kid

a total stranger in ticote the wild
volcanic barrens of northern arizona

chucklin kid canutt was none the less
the bearer of a letter that would intro-
duce him to judge lamison the ticote
lawyer as an individual of importance
sam had ridden for ten hours west-
ward from dry river through sharp-
rock country he was hungry and his
mount was tired and footsore hence
he looked first after his horse dis-
mounting at the town corrals leaving
instructions for feeding then he hied
himself into the chinese restaurant next
door

  lie ordered a pair of chicken dinners
radishes olives celery two pieces of
apple pie and ice cream for the first-
time in his life he felt rich but that
did not lighten his blues

  i feel discouraged and me a heir
he muttered settling back in his chair
i knowed plumb well t didnt like


western story magazine

this country-nothin but rocks and
lava my dream is blasted down in
dry river cheys at least some grass i
wouldnt stick here if i inherited the
whole country let alone a little thou-
sand-acre ranch of rocks  reckon im
homesick for the boys

  and he was for a month he had
been in kansas city settling up his
uncles estate he had landed in dry
river just long enough to cache his
city-visiting dude clothes and start
north to claim his ranch the letter
he carried was from the legal firm in
kansas city to judge lamison anent
the cowboy heir and the bar t dot
property

  his spirits rose somewhat as he fin-
ished the meal he walked out and
up the dusty street to the weather-
beaten building from which hung the
shingle judge t i lamison attor-
ney at lav

  the judge-whose title was purely
honorary-sat at his desk playing soli-
taire  he was a lanky alkali-dusty indi-
vidual in faded shirt suspenders boots
and spurs one who rode daily to and
from his ranch place eighteen miles out
of ticote beneath shaggy gray brows
a pair of mild-brown eyes twinkled
genially chucklin kid canutt liked
his appearance he looked honest sam
extended the letter and watched the
lawyers eyes widen as he read it judge
lamisons gaze swept to the cowboy
appraising him critically

  we-all thought the new owner was
a city man-a tenderfoot the judge
scratched his head gil crawford will
be surprised so will bowie kurtz and
the whole frying pan outfit

  sam canutt chuckled they the
ones thats offered me twentv thousand
aint they well im goin to take it
sight unseen without even travelin up
to look her over the stocks about
worth that and i wouldnt give a mex
nickel for this whole blamed so-called
range

  the judge smiled itll save vuii a
mite of trouble to do that mr canutt
-to sell i mean

 yea-uh huh how sam
slowly manufactured a cigarette

  itll save gil crawford and the
syndicate a lot of fuss forcing you io
sell thats what they planned to do-
yea-uh the chucklin kids
protruding ears seemed to jerk for-
ward and his chaps-incased legs
whipped up under the chair how
come 

  syndicate-the frying pan-has
been swallowing up everything gradu-
ally jot some tough hombres working
for them of course i dont want to
discourage you-seeing youre a cow-
man i had made up my mind to ad-
vise you to sell thinking you were a
tenderfoot and would not have a
chance even as it is youll have a
hard time bucking the big frying pan
outfit they fought your uncle for
years drove off his stock and maver-
icked his calves of late years he
stayed away as you know leaving a
foreman here named gillis to run
things-and cross-eye gillis between
us is a tool of gil crawford and the
syndicate

  whe-ee sam canutt whistled
and a throaty chuckle came from him
this is plumb inter-restin glad i
come he showed a row of glisten-
ing teeth resume t

  not much to add judge lamison
shook his head they offered the
twenty thousand-not a bad figure-
and i communicated the offer to the
k c firm bowie kurtz crawfords
foreman came down monday and
asked me to mention to the new owner
what happened to another stranger h
h blair who tried to run cattle up on
the cougar

  the chucklin kid looked solemn as
an owl what happened to mister
blair jedge

  thev burned him out and ran his
when chucklin kid didnt chuckle



beef over the cliffs into cougar
canon

  oh that all remarked sam dis-
appointedly they didnt do him any
bodily harm-personal

  he got out too fast

  the kid breathed a sigh of relief
then theys a chance for me yea-uh 
theyll burn me out-the sin-dy-kate
will and run my beef over them cougar
cliffs you mean jedge they jest
natcherly ruin me in a business way
if i dont sign on the dotted line

  thats about it-or try to the law-
yer affirmed seriously you might get
along being a cowman if youd hire a
hundred hands that liked a scrap then
it would be doubtful the frying pan
syndicate has a million behind it
crawford their agent and kurtz
foreman have instructions to bust
all the little outfits as your at-
torney i might suggest waiting until
the syndicate makes trouble then put-
ting crawford and kurtz under bond
but the frying pan has money enough
to fight even that frankly id advise
you to sell as i intended to do when
i thought you were a tenderfoot

  chucklin kid canutt scratched his
curly head that shore is inter-restin
here i come up here bilin mad at this
whole rock-lava country cussin a
region where there wasnt enough grass
for sheep decidin id close the deal
and sting them suckers that offered me
the twenty thousand it did look most
discouragin and now you spring this
promise uh trouble robbery arson and
mebbe murder temptin me to stay right
here where my new ranch is located at

kicked at his war bag disgustedly

  judge lamisons jaw fell you

yourself just because of some of their
threats 

  uh huh jedge where is this craw-
ford person as is agent for said sin-dy-
kate

  the chucklin kid rolled his big blue
eyes jedge if i was a pore ignorant

  and how do i get over to the bar
t dot my precious new holdins

  t was to take you over on the two
fifteen train your ranch lies west
forty-odd miles the santa fe stop is
cougar station

  sam canutt chuckled you wait
here a few minutes jedge

  he hustled out of the office made for
the general store across the street went
to the rear of the long storeroom and
picked out with some difficulty a suit
of clothes salt-and-pepper check mate-
rial  a summery cream-silk shirt purple
tie hose to match tan oxford shoes
and a light crush hat-such an outfit
as was infrequently sold to cowboys for
the monthly pay-day town dance

  when he eased himself into judge
lamisons office half an hour later the
judge blinked at him uncertainly

  dont you know me sam chuckled
yea-uh im him the new dude
owner of the bar t dot

  the transformed cow-puncher strut-
ted about the little room hands thrust
deep into the pockets of his black-and-
gray check trousers pants is about
wide enough crease and all to hide my
bandy laigs take care of my war

corner where he had dropped the bundle
containing his range apparel and
look after my hoss

utes

mr canutt im only an agent for
laird  baker the k c firm if
youre determined to fight crawford

more power to you- lie cut off

short theres crawford now
call him right in here jedge sam
hastily slid into a chair produced a
tailor-made cigarette lit it and puffed
tranquilly while the lawyer hurried out
a moment later the latter returned with
a tall lean personage wearing range
boots and a five-gallon hat sam made
quick appraisal of the cattleman-banker
as of the rule-or-ruin type of cow-coun-
try czar none too scrupulous not at all
merciful his crafty close-set eyes
told that

  mr crawford shake hands with
air canutt new owner of the bar t
dot

  a slow grin came to the face of the
syndicate agent as he fixed his gaze on
the nattily attired young man and
reached out a gaunt callous hand
crawford was no office capitalist

  mighty glad to meet yuh mist
canutt when yuh get in

  who-me  the chucklin kid
crossed his brightly clad legs uncrossed
them flecked the ashes of his snow-
white cigarette with a ladylike twist of
the wrist oh sir i jest arrove from
little ole ic c

  gil crawford eyed him amusedly

mighty glad yuhre here he said
blithely reckon laird  baker com-
municated my offer now we can draw

up the papers right here before the
judge

  sam canutts eyes opened wide
but sir i aint decided to sell he
said innocently

  what the syndicate man laughed
easily slowly drew up a chair yuhre
not figuring to operate the bar t dot
yuhrself his eyes roved over the
dude from purple tie to socks to
match

  yes sir thats jest about what i
figured id do the chucklin kid
reached for the feather duster on lam-
isons desk brushed the tips of his shin-
ing tan oxfords you see sir he
added plaintively i want to learn to
be a cowboy

 crawford grinned of course
yuhre joking mist canutt

  if i am i aint heard tell of it
there was a long moment of silence
during which gil crawford turned
questioning eyes on the judge flis
voice suddenly changed from genial
good nature to tones of silky menace
yes yuh must be joking mist canutt
assuming to go into the cow business
yuhr own self being a tenderfoot only
reason i can see is that yuh dont savvy
how rough this country is why yuh
wouldnt last any longer on ticote
range than a celluloid jack rabbit be-
ing chased by an asbestos coyote through
hades-if yuhll excuse me talking
plain

  ill excuse you sirif you mean im
said jack rabbit and youre that said

coyote now-

  look here young fellow the
range boss thrust his lean gaunt face
forward and his small intent eyes
gleamed with sinister meaning dont
yuh come any of that city-gangster
stuff on me yuh aint the usual type
of tenderfoot--yuh think yuhre tough
dont yuh yuh aint even educated
i reckon yuh dont know yuhre in
arizona his gaze bored into that of
the dry river puncher if yuh did
ivhen chucklin kid didnt chuckle



youd know who gil crawford hap-
pened to be now ill tell yuh some-
thing the syndicate czar tapped the
desk with his oaken-huecl knuckles

  i was in cougar station this morn-
ing-just rode overland from the fry-
ing pan he went on slowly theres
a big bunch of rustlers hanging around
in the hills and from what i heard
over there they calculate the bar t dot
will be easy picking the fact is there
are rumors yuhr foreman cross-eye
gillis is working in cahoots with the
rustlers gillis has got yuhr cattle all
bunched on the mesa right over cougar
canon yuhre a tenderfoot and
wont hardly understand but if i know
anything the only way you can save
yuhr stock is to take our money now
and let the frying pan punchers take
charge of yuhr herd rustlers wont
dare make a move with my boys and
bowie kurtz as guardians of the herd
do yuh savvy what im talking about
chucklin kid canutt looked decided-
ly sad and downcast oh sir you
think the rustlers whatever they are
will come down and do something to my
cows if i being a tenderfoot go in
there to take charge and you take
pity on me and want to save my cattle
by buyin them out sos your boys can
take charge-is that it mr crawford 
yuh hit the target son with both
barrels

  but them villains wouldnt do any-
thing mean right off sir immediate
would they

  rumors said they would likely strike
to-night son while cross-eye has yuhr
stock bunched thats why i wanted
to close this deal now so i could take
the two fifteen train back and place the
frying pan boys on guard gil craw-
ford rose its up to yuh son yuh
take the twenty thousand

  you couldnt make it twenty-five
mr crawford could you queried
sam anxiously lighting a fresh white
smoke

  not a cent over twenty that price
is liberal the syndicate aint a piker
son in buying in what it wants

  no really i dont think ill sell
then sir said sam rising and running
his hand smoothingly about the crown
of his new light hat somehow ive
always wanted to be a cowboy id jest
love to fight rustlers-and everything
yuhll likely have no herd left by
to-morrow canutt

  but dont you think them rustler
fellers would hold off a day say-if i
should come back to-morrow noon
ready to close sam chuckled silently
as he met the swiftly narrowing gaze
of the syndicate man

 what do yuh mean snapped
crawford yuh insinuating i
have anything to do with those rus-
tlers

  oh goodness gracious no sir 
sech a wicked thought never entered
my cranium chucklin kids ex-
pression was very sad and reproachful

  look here canutt you dont run
any blazer on gil crawford sabe
now ill tell yuh ill send a rider
over there to-night telling my boys to
guard yuhr herd-this one night if
yuh think yuh might change yuhr mind

and come back to-morrow-

  id kinda like your permission to
look over my property-jest once said
the tenderfoot meekly if you dont
mind sir then if i decide to sell
would you have the cash

  i reckon my bank could raise the
money asserted the range boss stiffly
ill give yuh till to-morrow noon-and
then the deals off after that my boys
wont protect yuhr stock now i got
to be going gil crawford turned
hastily and strode out to the street

  chucklin kid canutt grinned up at
judge lamison a nice perlite way
he has of tellin me hell assassinate my
herd if i dont take his kind offer
now give me some writin paper and
you fix yourself out a power of attor-

ney sam sat down at the desk he
scribbled hastily and in three minutes
handed the lawyer a sealed envelope
your instructions open her to-mor-
row if i dont get back here before
noon now i got to ketch the train

  he straightened his legs smoothed
his trousers and struck out toward the
depot a low adobe building boasting a
lone telegraph operator-ticket agent and
a squint-eyed indian squaw who sold
pottery on the rare occasions when
trains stopped on flag when the two
fifteen departed chucklin kid departed
with it an hour and ten minutes later
he climbed down from the dusty day
coach at cougar station consisting of
one building and many cattle pens and
shipping chutes

  he walked a few steps halted drew
out his snowy silk handkerchief and
mopped his brow then he struck a
pose gazing about in bewildered fashion
as he had often seen eastern tourists
do mouth agape he seemed awed at
the queer sights the odd-looking char-
acters loading cattle on a siding in flap-
ping bat wing chaps bearskin goat-
skin calfskin one of these sidled down
from the seat of a buckboard and strode
toward the stranger this was probably
the puncher who had come to meet
judge lamison and the new owner
he was a study in range ornateness in
huge green felt hat robins-egg silk
shirt speckled fawnskin vest flaming
red neckerchief gay ribbon dust rags
about the sleeves and scroll-leather
peaked boots

ter canutt wheres the jedge

into the warped old buckboard and the
were on the way

hanniford yuhre due to be eddi-
cated

the tenderfoot rapturously and the bar
t dot puncher turned quickly and shot
him a look
when chucklin kid didnt chuckle

niford wait till yuh meet yuhr fore-

the dry river man i want to learn
to be a cowboy which is why im goin
to stick you look like a real good
one do you give lessons

  yuhll git lessons enough growled
buck

  im hopin so

  they rode on in silence after for-
ty-five minutes they readied the old
weather-beaten ranch house more of a
ruin than a dwelling a few corrals
and two miserable sheds near a wind-
mill completed the improvements of the
bar t dots thousand acres of precari-
ous grazing range

   the place was deserted save for eight
or nine bronchos in tlie horse corral
and ling the ranch flilnky and cook
at sams suggestion hanniford drove
the buckboard to a rise beyond the
house now said the new proprietor
which is the boundaries of my hold-
ins 

  the puncher motioned south and
east yuh see the line uh that dry
crick well it jumps from there to
them three buttes southward then the
foothills is the boundary breakin into
cougar crick again theres the boys
and i reckon chuck is waitin

  five horsemen had trailed in from
the canon side of the ranch when
buck had got back with his passenger
they found supper ready in the dilap-
idated mess hall of the old house four
glum and silent hands were seating
themselves around the oilcloth when
sams dude figure loomed in the door-
way they gave him a single look
hung their heads down low to their
granite-ware plates and rudely rammed
their boot heels down on each others
toes

  boys said buck hanniford sud-
denly cheerful as he strode in this is
the new owner mister sam-u-el canutt

of missoury-k c missoury he
calclates if this country is wild and
woolly he has got to be showed he
wants to take lessons in cowboyin
wheres the boss he wheeled quick-
ly at sound of thudding boots mis-
ter gillis shake the hand uh mister
canutt of k c missoury thats got
to be showed thats decided to stick and
wants to take lessons in cowboyin
cross-eye gillis had come to a sud-
den stop he backed away a step and
rubbed his eyes are yuh joshin me
he snarled at hanniford and strode
quickly forward and pinched the dudes
arm then pinched himself

  sam canutt reached out languidly
and yanked the foiremans long red
mustache yes sir he said dole-
fully were all awake im the new
owner i got to be showed and i
dont intend to let go of sech a promisin
property as this here bar t dot till
ive learned to be a cowboy he slid
into a chair by the table spread out his
snowy handkerchief for a napkin but-
toned his check coat and sat back erect
hands folded do you gentlemen esti-
mate ill make a success of it

  oh yeh oh yeh cross-eye
gillis dipped into the seat farthest re-
moved nudged buck hanniford
yuhll do elegint

  the bar t dot bunch ate swiftly in
silence save for the continuous smack
of lips munch of teeth and frequent
growls at the obsequious chinese cook
chucklin kid canutt caught their fur-
tive exchange of glances with one an-
other but he tackled the broiled steaks
and fried spuds with solemn earnest-
ness saying nothing

  suddenly cross-eye gillis slammed
down his fist and rose it was a signal
for a general scramble for the rickety
gallery we got to hustle cried
gillis to show the new proprietor his
herd afore dark

  sam canutt leisurely lit one of his
tailor-mades rose brushed his light

crush hat with his sleeve adjusted it on
the back of his head and followed

  kin you ride a hoss cried gillis
fixing sam with a stare that crossed him
botli ways

  oh yes sir i think so if its a
nice tame horse asserted the dude
readily if you boys will put on the
saddle

  tlieys a nice tame anemile already
saddled said the foreman grinning
and raising a hand toward the corral
he led the way toward the inclosure
a moment later the riders were swing-
ing up to their own mounts two of
the bronchos sam noted bore frying
pan brands the others were labeled
with the bar t dot but the dry river
puncher was more interested in the
sleepy-looking hammer-headed pony
that stood tied to the top pole of the
corral at the lower end already sad-
dled chucklin kid had seen such
sleepy-looking buckers before he sur-
mised that cross-eye gillis had sighted
the buckboard and the new arrival on
the hillside and had got the broncho
rigged probably with difficulty for a
special purpose

  the riders walked their mounts to-
ward the lower end of the corral while
gillis motioned to the new owner to
follow before the sleepy broncho they
halted

  thats yuhr pony mist canutt
informed gillis gravely jest climb
aboard he turned his own mount
and the other riders spread out about
the tame-looking outlaw horse

  are you sure hes a nice easy-ridin
mare asked the tenderfoot approach-
ing the animal timidly

  he is asserted cross-eye solemnly
aint he the tamest mare on the
ranch  he gestured to the hard-faced
crew who were watching the scene with
shifty averted eyes

  hes as gentle as a kitten affirmed
one and if yuh listen real dost yuh
kin hear him pur

  i dont know whether you boys is
jokin me  not said the new pro-
prietor meekly but i dont guess he
can kick any harder than a missoury
mule he sidled up toward the
broncho lids narrowing at the wall-
eyed stare of the broomtail inten-
tionally he approached from the oft side
which is the proper stirrup for climb-
in up onto these here western ponies
anyway 

  whoa-a there hombre warned the
alarmed buck hanniford you better
git on his left becawse even a dead
hoss is techy if yuh fuss with his

right-

  jumpin frijoles it was the awe-
some yelp of cross-eye gillis the dude
had yanked loose the slip knot of the
tie rope and with a sudden grotesque
jump in which he hit and left the
ground like a rubber ball sams pep-
per-and-salt figure shot upward and
astraddle the prize bucker of the ticote
range his well-pressed trousers
widened and closed like a pair of scis-
sors and his tan oxford shoes fitted
into the stirrups chucklin kid half
closed his eyes and winced he expected
to be pitched and made ready for the
spill in the art of which he was adept
he was bootless and spurless unpre-
pared to battle a sun-fishing son of a
gun such as he knew the outlay to be
he waited for the inevitable pin wheel
of the bronchos legs and the ferris-
wheel skyrocket of his back

  then while cross-eye gillis buck
hanniford and the bar t dot hands
leaned forward in their saddles with
sagging jaws the outlaw horse trotted
down the line like an old cow carrying
the strange creature in dude clothes as
though they had been friends for life
whether it was the absence of the spur
or through mere horse amazement at
the audacity of the leap and the queer
looks of the rider sam did not know-
or care he suppressed the chuckle that
welled deep in his throat shook his
when chucklin kid didnt chuckle



shoulders to simulate the jogging of a
green man in the saddle made sure that
the broncho had no notion to perform
then drew up and waited for the bunch
who sat glued to their saddles a hun-
drew yards back

  when cross-eye gillis finally jogged
slowly up in the van of the gaping rid-
ers he swept his hand across his eyes
squinted painfully in the sunlight at the
meek outlaw sniffing at a wisp of dry
grass oblivious to the doleful figure
astride him gillis lips moved but no
sound came from them chucklin kid
canutt looked surprised

  i thought you boys was in a hurry
he said this here mare is tame and
slow enough  but he certainly is a faster
pacer than them ponies of yours or
was i goin the wrong direction

  yuh was headed correct said gillis
hoarsely looking from one to the other
of his men

  well then lets hustle and you ride
alongside of me mister foreman
sam turned his mount and set the
pace while the amazed cross-eye loped
at his side gaze fixed on every move of
horse and man presently where the
mesa yucca and spanish bayonet grew
denser cross-eye broke into a slow jog

  mist canutt was yuh ever cnnected
with a circus or anythin like that  he
queried

  no sir i cant say i ever was as-
serted sam gravely

  yuh never had no dealins with han-
dlin anemiles-lions tigers panters
and sech

  only anemiles i mostly ever had
anything to do with was bulls and bears
-playin the stocks said sam -humbly
why

  oh i was jest wonderin

  they rode west in the face of the
setting sun where is this here fryin
pan ranch i hear gil crawford tellin
about queried sam after a time

  cross-eye gillis halted yuh was
talkin to gil eh he pointed to the

purple-shadowed foothills the fry-
in pan lays agin that granite slope
where yuh see that patch o white
the new owner looked puzzled
how do cows live on sech a waste
of sand and rock and cactus he de-
manded this thousand acres aint
worth a lot is it mr gillis

  the foreman laughed yuh kin git
a thousand like it for nothin easy
yuhr cows is grazed on forest range
fer a fee except about two months
when there is a leetle grass after the
rains yuhr holdins is chiefly cattle
and the buildins and yuhre foolish if
yuh dont snap up the offer of the
syndicate pronto mist canutt

  but i want to learn to be a cow-
boy protested sam i want to learn
to ride on them wild horses you read
about and throw a lariat and shoot a
pistol gosh i wish there really was
rustlers like jedge lamison and gil
crawford tells about

  there shore is rustlers aplenty
enlightened cross-eye right up in
them hills gesturing beyond the fry-
ing pan theyre itchin to grab yuhr
herd any minute now 

  but gil crawford said hed send a
rider sos the fryin pan would guard
my herd how long would it take a
man to reach here from ticote
three hours takin the short cut
through the cougar pass

  thats encouragin affirmed sam
by to-morrow ill have all you boys
organized to fight the rustlers myself
cross-eye gillis swore softly not
me he said i wont be led to no
slaughter by no tenderfoot

  then youre fired

  the foreman gulped i dont mean
i wont foiler orders mist canutt i
was ony say in you better let a experi-
enced cowman like me that knows
rustlers do the guardin

  cougar canon was in sight and cross-
eye swerved over to a little rise

  them is yuhr cattle on the aidge uh


western story magazine

that mesa he informed brusquely
them beef is prime for this range
see that gray stretch down there 
thats where the cliffs lies-where the
rustlers aims to run off yuhr herd
most uh the beef would be killed out-
right i reckon yuhd lose fifteen thou-
sand dollars if them thousand-odd head
went over that bluff mist canutt
kind of a mean cuss this rustler
captain and his men you think they
might be workin for bowie kurtz and
gil crawford of the sin-dy-kate 
gillis stiffened not any theyre
after the fryin pan cows too

  kinda funny gil told me hed let
the rustlers take my stock if i didnt
inform him id sell by noon to-mor-
row you know what i think mister
gillis i got a hunch gil crawford
is hirin them rustlers

  the foremans eyes bulged he
glanced narrowly toward buck hanni-
ford its easy to see yuhre a tender-
foot he growled huskily lookee
there fryin pan boys is cornin now
in the fading daylight a bunch of
seven or eight riders were rounding the
rim of the mesa they came on while
the bar t dot contingent waited

  five minutes later chucklin kid
canutt was introduced to the bearded
leader of the frying pan punchers
bowie kurtz sam marked him down
instantly as a man not to be trusted in
any outfits corral he was broad and
short shifty-eyed and profane in every
sentence with amused glances toward
the dude owner of the bar t dot he
talked of signs of rustlers

  dont swear so cussed much i dont
like it mister protested sam solemn-
lv i aint used to it bein new to the
west

  yuhll git used to it replied kurtz
withholding an oath boys lets all
turn in fer the night

  chucklin kid meekly followed the
example of the others in dismounting
asked buck hanniford to show him

how to remove bridle and saddle which
buck did with cautious movements
about the now placid outlaw horse
sam let cross-eye gillis help him
spread his bed roll and was the first
to turn in under the early stars the
hour was a ridiculous one for a bunch
of cow-punchers to go to bed sam knew
especially if a raid was expected he
watched gillis pass around a bottle post
two guards and order no fire no loud
talking no poker  lighted cigarettes

  we want to ketch em red-handed
explained the foreman

  gimme another lick at that redeye
muttered a puncher my couridge is
oozin fie broke into song

yeah my couridge is oozin

i gol to go boozin

i ought to be snoozin

this dog-gone battle ill be sure to be losin 

  fie let out a yelp as one of the
squatting punchers hurled a boot

  when cross-eye gillis kurtz and
hanniford began to talk in whispers-
loud enough for sam to hear-the dry
river cowboy chuckled silently he
suspected what was in store-an intro-
duction to rustlers more than once
in his own speckled career on the range
he had indulged the sport of tender-
foot baiting

  they was armed to the teeth he
overheard bowie kurtz declare it
was shore lucky fer this here dude that
gil crawford sent us waddies out to
guard the herd

  yuh shore they aim to strike to-
night gillis asked in a hoarse whis-
per

  they shore do-but theys enough
uh us to give em all the lead thev kin
tote

  out of one eye chucklin kid watched
their preparations for a surprise recep-
tion of the rustlers it was significant
that camp had been made a safe dis-
tance from the bedded cattle where
they would not take flight and go over
when chucklin kid didnt chuckle



the cliff gil crawford was not yet
ready to destroy the herd

  sams surmise was accurate to a de-
tail around ten oclock while guards
stood with six-shooters ready and while
cross-eye gillis kurtz and a dozen
others feigned slumber with loud snores
one of the guards came running and
shook the bar t dot foreman

  theyre cornin he exclaimed
huskily

         

  gillis and kurtz were on their feet
barking orders shouting loudly sad-
dle up

  suddenly a shot snarled from the

                s

brush and a cavalcade of riders bore
down on the camp another shot and
another stabbed the darkness with jets
of flame yells and yelps of pain
punctuated the tattoo of pistols and
rifles the frying pan and bar t dot
punchers made for their horses
chucklin kid lay very still he saw
riders topple backward from their
mounts and groan and lie motionless
he heard the wild shout of bowie
kurtz

  hey yuh canutt git onto yuhr
hoss and run fer yuhr life the rus-
tlers is too many

  cross-eye gillis and buck hanniford
sprinted for the blanket bed of the dude
owner seized the snoring form and
shook him sam yawned loudly and
opened his eyes whats all the fuss
he demanded sleepily

  rustlers theyre killin our men
lookit the dead gillis waved an arm
git up and run fer yuhr life we
halted em on the first charge but they
outnumber us ten to one-and we got
to git

  sam sat up youre fired if you
run sir he cried rally the boys
oh joy this is glorious-wunderfull
what i was prayin for real honest-
to-gracious skunkin sneakin robbin
murderin rustlers boys rally around
your leader well capture and shoot
and burn and skelp and torture and ex-

terminate these outlaws to a man
chucklin kid pulled  his shoes rose
stretched his arms brushed his trousers
and demanded the location of the at-
tacking army

  theyre right over in them shad-
ders cried cross-eye motioning to a
dark splotch on the sky line where
horses were faintly visible theyre
gittin ready to charge agin

  good chucklin kid shook his
legs and sauntered forward how
many dead on our side

  they must be six-seven

  that aint so bad will one of you
gentlemen kindly lend me your gun
we need our guns for self-pertec-
tion cried the foreman

  gimme your pistol or youre tired
snapped the tenderfoot he reached
and had the weapon in hand now
get me somethin white

  somethin white exclaimed bowie
kurtz whats that fer

  a flag of truce sir has anybody
got somethin white oh well-
chucklin kid slowly pulled off his
shirt-thisll do pie reached for
kurtzs rifle

  no you dont git that gun snarled
the frying pan foreman

  chucklin kid thrust out his bor-
rowed  let the barrel weave reck-
lessly amateurishly on the person of
the protesting cowman kurtz held out
the rifle hastily

  cross-eye gillis was swearing lustily
he watched the dude tie the loose arms
of the silk shirt to the muzzle end of
the rifle whats the idee of a flag
o truce he questioned angrily

  to trick em betray em double
cross em villains that would shoot
down our men dont deserve to live
well bluff em into thinkin were goin
to hold a parley then shoot em down
in cold blood you boys jest follow
along he strode forward climbed
onto one of the hastily saddled horses
and loped toward the faintly visible
western story magazine

riders his cream-colored shirt held aloft
on its rifle mast

  sam had not been blind to the swift
departure of one of the punchers a brief
minute before he had observed the
galloping rider round the bend of a
near-by draw and guessed his purpose
-to notify the others of the syndicate
outfit that the tenderfoot was on the
way armed with a colt  and a rifle
-and fool enough to use them

  shirtless bare arms bobbing his un-
dergarment billowing in the wind the
make-believe tenderfoot increased his
speed cutting a figure that gave the
staring punchers pause dead men
jumped to their feet gaping at the hazy
vanishing figure and the fluttering flag
of truce he bore

  well ill be cursed blurted out
bowie kurtz

  and hes got my six-shooter with
four catridges in her growled cross-
eye gillis hes fool enough to shoot
and i sent buck to warn em theyll
beat it shore and the next best thing
we kin do is to sneak home and go to
bed gimme another shot of redeye

  yuhve had too much aready
bowie kurtz assumed charge git
home the bunch uh yuh he snarled
im goin to stick an se this thing
through he mounted swiftly and
started in pursuit

  ho hum sam canutt chuckled as
he saw the milling rustlers turn and dart
away in the near shadows now i
got to risk a exhibition of horseman-
ship

  he sank the heels of his low oxfords
into the flanks of his mount knew from
his experience with horses that he was
astride an animal that could run with
the best from his meager knowledge
of the lay of the country he guessed
that the fleeing punchers were heading
for the frying pan at the base of the
distant foothills

  he yanked down the rifle flagstaff
bent forward and galloped straight for

them they were streaking through
the mesquite and cactus of the mesa
he was gaining as he neared he
could see their moving heads as they
turned to watch him and guessed with
a long-drawn-out chuckle that they were
an amazed and half-scared bunch of
cowboys

  looking back he saw but one rider
in his wake and unerringly surmised
that the rest would not be there when
he returned dead men included who
was in pursuit he did not know the
forward bunch reached a deep arroyo
were forced to slacken speed to cross
it and chucklin kid struck the near
bank in time to sight the colorful buck
hanniford among eight others he
hoisted the rifle flag and yelled shrilly

  halt you villains or ill wipe out
the bunch he sent a  ball spin-
ning near the ear of buck hanniford

  the nearest five wheeled and faced
him four raced madly away risking
fire sam was satisfied at that what
are you robbin murderin cutthroats
runnin for  he demanded with a show
of anger aint you ever heard tell
of a flag of truce

  there were low grunts of disgust
and buck hanniford swore softly if
yuhre a tenderfoot canutt he shot
out suddenly where did yuh learn to
ride 

  i aint a tenderfoot you gents have
plumb broke me into ridin returned
sam cheerfully now who are you
scoundrelly rascals anyway and whats
one of my own hired men doin here
with a bunch of cow-burglarin assassins
like you im a dude from missoury
but if you aint a bunch of low-down
sin-dy-kate fryin pan range yeggs
youve got to show me he turned as
the pursuing horseman drew up sharply
recognizing the bearded bowie kurtz
im goin to practice up bein a cow-
boy dead shot right here-now he
yanked the six-shooter from his belt

  hey yuh canutt put up that gun
when chucklin kid didnt chuckle



or ill drill yuh bowie kurtz lung-
ing forward after slipping from the
saddle halted in his tracks as the dudes
colt belched and a bullet ripped off his
hat sams shrill words broke the suc-
ceeding stillness

  now you thievin highbinders ride
and dont let me ever ketch you tryin
to burglarize a gentlemans honest cows
again he sent the three remaining
bullets over the riders heads very
close and they did not wait bowie
kurtz darted in and seized the empty
gun

  come along buck he snarled for
buck alone had held his ground
lookie here canutt ony thing
saved yuh from bein potted was be-
cause they didnt dast shoot a tender-
foot now i reckon is time to lay our
cyards on the table he thrust his
bearded face forward were the
syndicate sabe and we run this
range there aint any room for the
bar t dot lessen its part of the fryin
pan understand 

  my goodness gasped chucklin
kid im relieved to know how things
stands buckie and bowie will you
escort me home 

  i aint escortin yuh home flared
kurtz im ony pausin to tell yuh
git clear of ticote range pronto like
gil crawford told yuh to if yuhre

a hoof uh stock left

  thats too darned bad said sam
sadly rustlers will clean me out to-
morrow night sure wont they oh
well-buck will you show me how to
get home

  yeah the tall cowboy and
chucklin kid rode back to the bar t
dot buck hanniford waxed confiden-
tial i like yuhr style mister say the
word and ill stick with yuh and hep
yuh hold yuhr property

  much obliged returned sam dole-
fully i might call on you because
im sure goin to stick

  in the morning at breakfast sam
found a glum and silent trio of bar
t dot employees watching him nar-
rowly they were uncommunicative
about the raid all the humor gone out
of them

  i thought some of you boys was
dead sam drawled and no one an-
swered cross-eye gillis was fidgety
ill-tempered

  who is bringin in the dead men
pursued sam cross-eye admitted that
the two missing bar t dot hands were
out riding herd it was jest bowies
little joke he said

  you boys meant well and it was
sure entertainin affirmed sam

  i reckon i got to make a trip over
to the fryin pan on business to see
bowie about the fence hes puttin
around the mesa water hole muttered
cross-eye a little later

  they fencin a water hole de-
manded the tenderfoot quickly-almost
too quickly

  the foreman started talkin about
it he evaded

  oh well hurry back i might
need you

  you goin to stick gillis eyed the
dude owner crookedly

  you bet no need for you to tell
bowie he knows

  the foreman shrugged mounted and
rode off he had not gone far when
chucklin kid saw the frying pan fore-
man loping toward the bar t dot the
two conspirators came together they
halted talked a while then started back
to the bar t dot

  bowie kurtzs bearded countenance
wore a frown as he dismounted before
sam he looked at his watch noon
train into ticote leaves cougar station
in a hour and a half he said gil
crawford is expectin yuh then

  let him expect deal is off noth-
in im fonder of than this cowboy life
fightin rustlers and all

  kurtz and cross-eye gillis stuck


western story- magazine

around sam busied himself within the
old house moving the rickety remains
of furniture about arranging an office
room from which to direct the affairs of
the ranch kurtz grew more uneasy as
he watched these activities as train
time neared he could stand it no longer
yuhre a plumb fool if yuh dont take
the syndicates twenty thousand ca-
nutt to-night yuh wont be able to
sell all yuh got left for a thousand

  if your rustlers aint any worse than
them last night i aint worryin none
said sam grinning as he called in buck
hanniford to help him patch up broken
windows

  when time for catching the train had
passed bowie kurtz mounted and rode
swiftly south cross-eye gillis con-
tinued to hang around with his men
as the afternoon wore on storm clouds
gathered in the northern sky sam and
buck hanniford chatted as they worked
in the dilapidated old house

  yuh aint no tenderfoot murmured
buck finally

  no 

  no whats yuhr game

  fightin rustlers i reckon you
say theres only one trail to the bar
t dot through the pass

  yeah

  no more trains in to-day mused
the dry river man howd you like
to make yourself a hundred dollars

  middlin

  ease yourself off to that pass then
and if any rider comes through this
afternoon hog tie him or hold him
any way you want to dont let gillis
see you go

  it was arranged sam busied himself
making plans for permanent occu-
pancy knowing the cross-eyed foreman
was watching these activities narrowly
gillis asked where buck had gone

  mebbe i sent him to help ride herd
replied sam evasively

  fryin pan will act swift to-night
eaid cross-eye it looks like a norther

was blowin up couldnt be a better
night while them beef is bunched over
cougar canon

  didnt ever occur to you to move
that herd did it mister gillis
nobody give me orders

  you bunched em without orders-
unless you got em from kurtz oh
well get the boys together now and
well ride over im goin to test you
out see how well you will scrap rus-
tlers if you dont fight em youre
fired

  the cross-eyed foreman grinned as
though the threat worried him none
its plumb early yet he drawled

  get goin sir immediate chucklin
kid was a bit irritable

  since the departure of buck hanni-
ford he had been doing a lot of serious
thinking he wished now he had not
sent buck he was worried about the
cattle and his conscience began to trou-
ble him the meanness of the syndi-
cate hirelings in planning to maim and
destroy the dumb beasts became more
apparent to him but his own part in
the situation plagued him most

  he had already sold that herd with
the ranch

  the instructions to judge lamison
in the sealed envelope had been ex-
plicit to close the deal if sam did not
come back

  now buck hanniford would halt any
messenger from gil crawford bearing
news of the deal and the destruction
of the herd would go  apace it
would be sweet revenge on the syndi-
cate-but-

  chucklin kid looked genuinely sad
and downcast as he trudged toward the
corral as a clean square-shooting
cowman he must prevent destruction of
the cattle even if gil crawford de-
served to lose them through his own
manipulations then too sam wanted
to look more thoroughly into the wa-
ter-hole matter mentioned by cross-eye
gillis chucklin kid mounted the wall-
when chucklin kid didnt chuckle



eyed broncho he had ridden the night
before and the bunch set oft for the
mesa and the canon

  on the way sam insisted on veering-
southward to look at the earthen
tanks that had been thrown up
around the water hole to his amaze-
ment his practiced eye told him the
origin of the water supply was artesian
-and the spring was on bar t dots
ground there was no sign of fenc-
ing as yet but all was clear to the
dry river man the syndicate desired
that spring above everything else
hence the apparently liberal offer for
stock and land

  the bar t dot had been worth dou-
ble the price judge lamison had been
authorized to accept

  gloomily chucklin kid turned back
with cross-eye gillis toward the herd
the two punchers who had been left in
charge had already got the cattle hud-
dled together close to the rim of the
canon after satisfying their thirst the
fact was significant

  the wind rose the night fell black
starless chill with a hint of snow sam
canutt and his four employees joined
the other two riders at the trench-fire
camp where the mesa fell off into
cougar canon

  scarcely a word was spoken for

  cross-eye gillis countenance grew
ghastly in the light of the trench fire
he suddenly turned mounted and rode
through the darkness toward the silent
forms of the waiting frying pan con-
spirators

  ten minutes later a dozen riders were
on duty along the rim of the canon
chucklin kid rode with them through
the night others of the syndicate out-

twinkled and a chuckle escaped his lips
i reckon cross-eye and bowie both
stand fired before the day is out for
what they didnt do to my cows

 coloradans opposed to perpetual grazing permits
 the granting of permanent grazing permits on public lands in colorado is
 opposed by many prominent citizens and organizations in that state one
 of the most important of these organizations is the colorado mountain club
 it is pointed out that the granting of such grazing permits would tend to keep
 out homesteaders and delay development in much area of the state making-
 grazing rights practically superior to forest water recreation hydroelectric and
 wild-life preservation in national forest reservations

the race

ut on the desert the
mighty silence was broken
only by the thunder of
pounding hoofs-hoofs
that rose and fell with an
unbelievable beat on
swept the two moving things a
mounted route guard waved a hat
another was trying to quiet his nervous
pony as the racers flew by the pinto
was ahead annabel lee was leading
by three full lengths and the man on
her back was bending low over his
horses neck taking a backward squint
frequently at the rushing form follow-
ing him

  the second mile was passed anna-
bel lee was holding her own on she
galloped like a fantastical creature of
color up and down moved her mag-

nificent legs with a steady pound which
took the very hearts blood out of buck
tedford as he watched them the hills
came here was the first test-the
broken axle hills laden with grease-
wood and covered with mesquite-
through which wound the thin lurid line
of dangling red flannel markers this
up-and-down going would kill a lung-
weak animal

  at the very first rise the paint pony
showed her mettle over that low slope
she bounded like a deer the voice of
the man above her was soft and musical
in her ears these moved back and
forth as the coaxing tones drove a
sense of comradeship home to the mare
the crest was topped and here con-
nemara boy drew up on a dead level
with the pinto

  homely his face wet with perspira-
tion turned and stared brazenly into
the popping eyes of buck tedford


western story magazine

 have you got me graded he
shouted

  all the time and all ways yelled
buck and the finish of this romp
will be the finish of you

  you think its amarillo for mine
eh

  amarillo the devil its in this sand
right here and now

  connemara lurched there was a jerk
on the bridle rein then a long-shanked
spur bit into his side the great racing
machine swung at annabel lee while
buck tedfords loaded quirt end came
down on homelys neck but the
enormous heavily starched collar broke
the force of the blow and before ted-
ford could take advantage of half a vic-
tory connemara boy now furious at
the touch of the spur was pulling away
from annabel lee and running at
tremendous speed for a thick brush
cover

  just after buck had stung the high-
natured horse with the dig of the rowel
a man appeared on a slight rise directly
ahead

  buck tedford was frantically trying
to control his horse and signal the man
at the same time homely watched with
amazement

  then came a loud coarse shout
drop him as he rides by the voice
was bucks

  the being now directly ahead stared
into homelys face homelys mouth
opened his jaws sagged and a
ludicrous stupefaction filled his fea-
tures yet in the fleeting look as he
dashed past homely knew the man it
was menifee and in his hands was held
a carbine

  jerking annabels head to one side
and dropping his upper body over her
shoulder he pulled her into a thorn
thicket as a gun cracked and a bullet
whined above him the spines of the
cacti cut into his flesh and twice he
was nearly pulled from the saddle but
he guided the pinto back into the trail

and fled after connemara boy with an
even and tremendous gait

  now the thoroughbred was out of
sight

  a small hill crest lay between the
pinto and the larger racer when this
eminence was reached hlomely caught a
fleeting vision of buck laying back on
his mount and trying to slow it down
then he vanished

  buck again appeared-this time be-
side a guard a mounted man they
seemed to speak these two as they
rode a dust cloud arose and when it
settled both men had disappeared

  thats funny mused homely
whered that second fellow get

  out in a bare spot on the trail and
higher up on the hill connemara boy
shot and dissolved into another thicket

  then as homely sped between two
heavy clusters of greasewood there
flashed a sudden twisting streak of
white along the earth the youth
closed his eyes he knew what that
meant a rope a lariat had been
strung across that trial

  already he could feel the crashing
impact of the fall the biting contact
with the earth but it did not come
the saddle reared beneath his body
and a delightful arch came into annabel
lees neck he felt the mares power-
ful hind quarters gather in a mighty
effort then the constant clippety-clap
of those beating hoofs ceased to ring

  the beat of the feet was broken
homely reacted with the swift cunning
of his riding nature instantly he re-
adjusted his position and took the air
with the flying pinto settling himself
for the shock of those alighting feet
it came annabel lee resumed her
tireless and road-eating gallop

  thata girl yelled homely you
sure seen that bear loop didnt you
honey now lets go there cant be
no more of em

  then he looked back the rope was
being pulled into a bush and as it flew
homely hunter of ghost river



along small spirals of dust arose from
the jerking honda at its end homely
wiped his face and a streak of black
grease paint covered his crimson neck-
erchief

  the thought of how he would look at
the finish brought to his lips a pitiful
smile without being conscious of the
act he attempted to cleanse his face of
the black coating which covered it

  then somehow he felt the mare set-
tle herself into the long deep stride
which told of her second phase of rac-
ing far ahead so far in fact that
he could only see bucks highly colored
shirt ran the great connemara the
timbered hills offered a broken vision
of the road but the red flannel markers
were so placed that even a child could
have followed the route out came the
horse ahead on a treeless tract where
the road circled in a wide arch which
homely knew to be the last bend 
the return to the track clayton loomed
ahead

  annabel lee was cutting down the
lead of connemara boy

 ahead of tedford a horseman
showed who paid no attention to buck
and his mount but seemed engrossed in
the vision of the running pinto this
abstraction evidently intrigued buck
for he bent low and took a backward
glance at homely when he arose
hunter saw him gently prod conne-
mara with a left spur the act was
electrical in its results connemara
leaped side fell arose leaped again
and then rearing attempted to throw
his great bulk backward

  on ran annabel lee on went the
vague pantomime ahead and every act
of the great descendant of that other
connemara that wonderful sire of polo
ponies brought a tense thrill of delight
to homely hunter he knew what had
happened connemara had lost his
temper he had forgotten to run was
oblivious to the rushing hoofs back of
him and was fighting his rider

  annabel lee reached a point not
twenty feet behind connemara before
the distracted horse settled himself
the fury of connemaras mind gave
way before a stampede of eagerness to
get free from that hurrying sound back
of him the nobility of his irish and
american ancestry came with a rush
and as the mare flashed by connemara
he emitted a wild squeal like that of a
maddened mustang stallion

  homely sensed what that meant
knowing that a horse is of a single-track
mind one emotion at a time is all the
animal is capable of now connemara
was filled with an intense madness to
place his body ahead of that flying thing
before him his heart was in the work
his entire anatomy gave over to the
one business before him again came
the thud of those great hoofs as homely
took a new position in his saddle and
laid his head and shoulders along anna-
bel lees neck

  his voice murmured crooning words
into the flattened ears of the mare once
or twice his hand gently tapped in an
affectionate manner the long slick neck
now wet with perspiration somehow
this fondling of the pinto suggested
mollv mary-as he had last seen her
as he had seen her once in that shaft of
silver moonlight in the door of her
fathers house he saw molly mary
in her riding attire before the scream-
ing people jammed into the grand
stand closing his eyes homely be-
came another creature and no longer
heard the savage whistle of the wind
past his ears nor felt the tension of
the mares running effort he only saw
a girl

  that fancy gave way before a vague
hopelessness a soddenness of spirit
it was-chill dank and weakening
his heart beat furiously some qualitv
went out of his mind the spirit of the
race was jerked away from his con-
sciousness

  the rushing road the wraithlike cacti


western story magazine

and mesquite and prickly pear ap-
proached him jeered pointed with its
suggestive arms receded and was gone
the gray color overhead the scream of
the wind the drab and racing earth
under him-all these were it seemed to
him accompaniments to some destined
event soon to occur and he was rush-
ing into it blind dogged unafraid

  unafraid no he was afraid he
didnt want to lose molly mary he
didnt want to lose the sight the sound
the smell of that marvelous desert

  but the thing at hand now was to
win with this pinto this gallant little
animal running free and on its nerve
alone

  come on honey he screamed into
annabel lees ears

  connemara boy was heard at his
side the great nostrils were just out
there and a bit back of him but the
sound of the horses rushing breath held
for homely a strange and irksome note
he didnt glance at buck he paid not a
whit of attention to the animal at his
stirrup he was staring ahead at a
streak of color now dangling in a
vagrant wind at a rolling line of red-
the little flannel flags which led in a
gentle curve to a great and gaping hole
in a white and high fence the fair
grounds were almost before him the
top of the stand was alive with flutter-
ing ribbons of red and white and blue
beneath it was a motley of garish
shades-people the wind was up and
the streamers and flags and bunting
were calling to him 

  connemara boy moved ahead an-
nabel lee showed her first signs of
vexation but the leather bands which
joined her foaming mouth to iiomelys
hands gave forth ever so little pressure
stilling the eagerness which fled to the
mares heart

  now connemara was half a length-
then a full length ahead

  the gate of the track was jammed
with men these gave way and a wide

hole appeared and in this the white
posts and top-boards of the track fence
homely loosed his grip on the reins and
stroked annabels throat come on
baby nows your time as though a
gift of great delight had surged into the
resolute body of the mare she tore to
the side of connemara boy just as
buck tedford turned his head and
stared open-mouthed into homelys
eyes

  now buck cried homely heres
where we begins to ride a horse

  the pole arch of the gate flashed
overhead and both horses tore upon the
track in as even a position as one could
imagine

  from the stands came a multitude of
shrieking voices evoking some strange
and unfathomable sound the noise
seemed to strike the air a blow and be
hurled back by the somber sky above
in a hideous echo which magnified the
beat of the sound with a deafening
crash

   the fence posts flashed by like mobile
and living objects

  buck stared into homelys eyes but
made no reply to the taunt connemara
was forging ahead now his flaming and
pulsing and rigid nostrils were in front
of the finely shaped head of the mare
now his shoulder was opposite annabel
lees muzzle

  the first section of the grand stand
was approached and as the horses
rushed into full view of the frenzied
people the military band burst into a
wild and exultant music homely was
riding now so low upon his horse that
he could see her forefeet as they rose
and fell and seemed to touch the earth
he stared at the flashing boxes he
peered at the running row of people he
strained to catch a sight of just one
familiar face then he saw jeffries-
molly mary

   the girl was leaning far over the rail
of her box her face set in wild and
beautiful excitement she caught that
homely hunter of ghost river



look in that vision blind to her sur-
roundings her finger tips went to her
lips and she sent the symbol of a kiss
to him across that dirty flat surface of
the track

  homely was fast approaching the
point of exhaustion the race was tell-
ing on him the pound of the saddle
the tug of the pace the beat of the
pumping heart all these had worked at
his vital forces until now he was at the
border land of his endurance his
face streaked with black grease and
perspiration was twisted with exhaus-
tion his eyes were narrowed and grim
behind puckered and twitching lids and
his teeth had sunk into his lower lip as
though by this act he was enabled to
hold on

  but he had to do more than hold on
that thought boomed in him the
track had to be circled the finish was
to be on that streak before him that
white streak-when it flashed and ap-
peared the second time

  the thought of molly marys act
went hurtling into his brain as though a
rocket had burst there and showered
him with sweet and ineffable delights
she had flung him a kiss grimly
homely drew back his swollen lips and
laughed in answer to the girls greeting
then he was gone

  dixie was being played by the band

oh its a way down south in the land of
     cotton

        hurrah hurrah

        lead away lead away

 the maddened music seemed an
exultation a command lead away

  now cried homely youve got it
all honey

  he freed the bridle control and
pressed annabel lees sides with a
gentle touch of both spurs a cry hit
the air as the mare leaped even with
connemara the quarter-mile mark
flashed like a vague mass of gray into
the receding line of white posts the
back stretch seemed so close to homely

that he thought it was racing ahead of
him then he entered it he was count-
ing now

  another post went by a hundred
feet-and the noses of the two horses
were level buck tried to swerve con-
nemara into annabel lee for the mare
was on the rail but the furious pace
of the great horse permitted no atten-
tion to the tug on the rein it ran in
great leaps straight as a die three feet
off the side of the pinto

  the riding- position of the two men
was in some respects similar the only
difference being that buck leaned down
on the left side of his mount and home-
ly on the right as they rode each man
could stare directly into the face of the
other buck was watching annabel
lees head and stealthily peering for
some leg weakness which would permit
him to lurch his mount against her and
throw her off her stride homely
knew what was transpiring in bucks
mind and jeered into his face shes
just too much rooster old hand he
cried and shes a-going to win with
daylight between her tail and your
nose

  ill kill you for this as sure as i
meet up with you anywhere when this
is done i start smoking you  sight
shrieked buck

  youre killed this minute old centi-
pede answered homely youve shot
vour bolt and you aint got no stinger
left

  then came the straightaway and that
dim intangible shade across the track
buck saw it llomely fixed his eyes
upon it then annabel lee seemed to
inflate to fill with an abundance of
something which pulsed and upheaved
under the legs of her rider homely
caught the red nostrils of connemara
saw the horses raw and bulging eyes
then these were gone annabel lee
was out in front

 a roar came from the stands
homely turned his head and saw buck


western story magazine

using the quirt in a cruel and unbeliev-
ably swift punishment then he could
no longer sec the horse back of him it
was two lengths behind the whip had
jarred connemara boy out of the
thought of winning he became torn
by a frenzy to fight the thing on his
back

  there before the maddened people
the high-strung racer gave as true an
exhibition of resentment as was ever
evidenced by man he quit he quit
cold annabel lee with homely rid-
ing high wide and handsome and sit-
ting erect and holding with all his
strength to the reins flashed across the
whitewashed line a winner by at least
eight lengths

  the earth seemed to leap to jump
to fling itself up at him as homely
jogged annabel down the track an
eighth circled her and rode slowly up
to the judges stand

  amid a bedlam of sound he leaned
down and stared into the upturned face
of molly mary he felt hands striking
his back saw himself surrounded by
mounted men old jeffries was there
and in his gray eyes a dull and working
smoky fire played he was watching a
man of medium build walking slowly
across the track then came a tall man
and back of him ten other men the
sheriff big bill walton and his depu-
ties 

  homely stepped out of his saddle
and as he struck the earth molly mary
grasped his hand one of her arms went
around his waist oh she gasped
oh homely homely it was grand

  somebody was placing something
about homelys middle he abandoned
the beauty of molly marys eyes to
stare at the grim width of a gun belt
quick fingers buckled it

  your gun said a voice homely
grinned into the face of the foreman of
the lazy shield bar were kinda
fearin trouble

  then came another voice it was

that of a man of medium build whom
jeffries had been watching the
amarillo deputy sheriff

  i arrest you homely hunter the
man was saying for the murder of the
marshal of amarillo

  dont lay a hand on that boy
echoed the dull tones of hampton jef-
fries

  then up stepped big bill walton the
sheriff thats right he said if
you was to start away with this kid
these people would make sausage out of
you get out jeffries i parole
homely in your custody understand 
youll guard him and deliver him to me
upon proper credentials

   i sure will answered jeffries but
texas has got a real scrap on her hands
before she takes this kid braid that in
your cigarette he added to the officer
from texas

  a tall figure strode beside homely
a voice said and that goes just two
ways all across the board

  homely swung about and stared into
the working features of jerry ouigley

  boy was all the old man could
say boy my boy

  then after a moments silence jerry
raised his head and looked with kindly
eyes into the face of hampton jeffries

  darn my soul jeff he cried in a
strange voice ive been trying to stop
loving you for over thirty years ive
been a very old fool but this homely
showed me the way 

  jeffries leaped from his horse and
two old men stood with heads on the
shoulders of each and hands gripping
hands until the knuckles showed white
molly mary turned away her eyes
swimming tears her tiny polished boot
toe digging a hole in the earth

- ive been the fool jerry muttered
jeffries but its all right right now
gosh im tickled old friend

  come on yelled big bill walton
here comes buck and his men if a
gun cracks in this arena therell be a
homely hunter of ghost rlveli



hundred people hurt get him out of
here all you men

  slowly the little cluster of lazy
shield bar cowmen formed a circle
about annabel lee homely and the
rest as slowly working this circle out
of the press of the people toward the
jeffries stable at the far end of the
field

  the band was playing a martial air
the voice of the announcer was pro-
claiming the opening of the bronc rid-
ing and out in the open space a cow-
boy clown was provoking the crowd to
a loud mirth by grotesque antics with a
trained mule

  buck tedford took one look at the
slowly moving clot of horsemen then
turned toward his stable connemara
boy was streaked with lather trembling
in every fiber bucks men were stupe-
fied

  tedford rode slowly away alone as
he passed the grand stand a hullaballoo
of catcalls greeted him then hisses and
jeers buck lowered his head and laid
both hands over the horn of his saddle
when he reached the stable no handler
met him silently he unsaddled and
blanketed the racer washed out its nos-
trils and mouth and with a halter led it
outside walking it up and down for the
cooling out

  and as he walked a great tumult
raged in his heart a grim decision
came to him-murder

chapter xvi

a would-be lynching

in the closed surrey homely jerry
quigley molly mary and jeffries
hurried away from the grounds as
they were issuing from a side gate
fancy frank and jim kearney sig-
naled the driver who stopped the team
as jeffries stuck out his head

  we was a-wanting to sav a word

quigley sat in a room and talked talked
over topics which were dear to the

thing to jeff but by that time i was
pride poisoned and filled full of fiend

ther and further apart like a pair of
locoed mares

  and i interpolated jeffries i
tried to hem you up in all sorts of
cracks sos youd go poverty poor and
i could give it all back and show you
which a way i was a-setting in regards

enough to try to break you too why

eating a way under them big pine hills
at the bend and cutting a course through
ground what would water all that bot-

tom land of yours yes and run over

yarn in the hope that i could grab that
land and carry you some grief what
would make you bend and break my
way but it was all in my hate and in
that old greasers head

  no it wasnt cried homely she
sure is gnawing at them rocks heres
the real low-down on that thing

  and while jerry sat in a silent stupe-
faction homely told of his discovery
jeffries recounted the letter he had re-
ceived and what he had found out
about it in el paso jerrys face
blanched his hands gripped his chair
sides he seemed to seethe with a vast
and piercing inward emotion at the
close of the narrative he looked at his
watch

  ill be back for dinner he an-
nounced but right this minute ive
got a special thing or two to say to buck
tedford and i wants to have it said be-
fore he thinks he can ride back to my
ranch he picked up his hat and fled

  molly mary looked from the window

she cried and another man too do
you know him homely

  i cant identify his face said
homely but his nag sure looks like
the bronc i seen just before annabel
lee leaped that rope

homely hunter of ghost river



tent had opened the door and walked
from the room

  what homely said and what molly
mary answered was known only to
themselves and the four rough walls of
the small hotel time fled on  winged
feet before they were conscious of a
deep rumble down the street

  there was something ominous in that
profound tone of animal anger which
filled the air there was a quality
which hit a peculiarly evil and repulsive
chord molly marys face blanched
and her breath quickened then both
of them rushed to the window

  a mob exclaimed molly mary
theyve got menifee and that other
man in the lead yonder comes dad
and jerry and big bill walton oh
homely theyre going to lynch those
men on that flag pole in front of this
hotel

  i reckon somebody told somebody
what they tried to do to annabel and
me heres where i get down and talk
some for them hombres replied
homely moving toward the door

  but molly mary clung to his arm
dont go she implored i cant tell
you what it is but somehow i feel that
you should not go out on the street
homely please dont go you cant
do a thing its too late

  then a loud voice shouted wait
you boys wait i tell you

  it was big bill walton speaking
his voice arose out of the crowrd now
gathered about the flag pole in a mighty
tone it stilled the mutterings of the
crowd men paused and turned as they
led menifee and his companion to the
platform

  big bill leaped beside menifee and
raised a hand boys he shouted in
so loud a tone that his words carried all
over the square you havent heard it
all and im dead sure you aint aim-
ing none to pull off just half a job

  spill it quick bill the leader of
the mob cried

  these men have confessed that they
tried to kill homely or cripple annabel
lee because of a split they was to get
in the money bet bv smoky evans ike
witherspoon shorty fanton and buck
tedford if you fellows lynch them
here and now wheres our evidence to
hang a crime on these real bad ones
i promise you that these men will get
everything thats coming to them let
the law take its course boys

  molly mary turned back into the
room but homely was gone going
to the window she saw him walking
slowly across the street back of the
mob he elbowed a way to the sheriff
and she heard his clear and calm drawl
as he stared into big biirs eyes

  can i mutter a word or two he
asked

  a bellow of demand arose out of the
crowd

  i reckon boys said homely as he
took a place beside menifee and the
sheriff if any man in this here bunch
had oughta have a grudge its me but
what big bill says is dead right it
wasnt only to win this race that these
hombres tried to knock me silent out
on that sand no it was because of
a killing what come off back in amaril-
lo three men ike witherspoon
shorty fanton and the marshal of
amarillo years ago killed my dad last
summer i showed up in that town and
rode broncs and generally tried to earn
some easy-hard money them three
saw me and planned to put me away as
they did my dad for they figured i
was down out of wyoming to get ven-
geance the marshal led me down a
dark street he was joined in a quiet
spot by ike and shorty and then he
tried to kill me but i was too fast
for the three of them if you boys kills
these men then i stands trial for that
murder and ike and shorty are the
witnesses whatll put me away for
keeps if we can hang this job of to-
day on them weve sure got something


western story magazine

to say to a texas jury when they ex-
tradites me

  a murmur ran through the crowd

  what he says is plumb true yelled
menifee now nothing but a blanched
and trembling fear-stricken wretch
ike and shorty said just that much to
me and buck was wanting the kid put
away because witherspoon is a kin to
him ill sure tell what i knows if you
give me the chance

  jim kearney leaped beside homely
his face was white his eyes wild a
deep nervous tremor racked his
throat

  homely never shot that marshal
he cried i shot him from behind a
tree when i seen him about to pull his
gun

  then in a swift narrative he told
of all that he had seen and heard in
amarillo of his escape to the north
of the letter fancy frank had sent him
and why he had come to clayton to be
of service to homely then out of the
hotel window there came a voice

  the mob swung about as one man
and stared at the pale face of molly
mary her lips moved the throng
grew still to catch her words

  i know what these men say is true
she exclaimed i was passing down a
street in amarillo on my way to the
depot and i came to a place where three
men were surrounding a fourth one
of the men lit a cigarette and by its
light i recognized homely as the man
whose bronc riding i had admired that
same afternoon i complimented him
on his performance and passed around
the corner midway in the block i
heard a shot and an instant later a man
iknow to have been jim kearney
passed me on the run you mustnt
lynch these prisoners if you want to
do a good deed for me and for homely
let them live and all of you get out and
find ike witherspoon shorty and
ruck tedford unless something is
done and done quick homely will have

to stand trial for a murder he never
committed please boys please

  a silence followed her appeal then
the leader of the mob threw the rope
that had been placed about menifees
neck into big bills hand and turning
to the crowd cried boys i reckon
shes all right as big bill says whats
your pleasure

  get buck

  wheres them other birds  another
shouted

  lets go cried a third

  the mob broke into small clusters
and parted sufficiently for the sheriff to
lead his prisoners safely down the
street as he rounded a corner a man
ran to a hitch pole leaped upon a horse
and darted away the brand on the
hip of that pony molly mary recog-
nized as the two bar slash tum-
bling t

  instinctively she knew that the rider
was heading some place to warn the men
whom the mob was now bent  cap-
turing she tried to scream to catch
the eye or the ear of homely or her
father but the turmoil in the street
the rushing of men here and there and
the confusion incident to a new design
held the mob in a distraction which pre-
vented her from making her voice
heard when she saw jerry ouigley
homely and jeffries start for the hotel
she dropped into a chair and gave way
to tears

  when once more she looked from the
window the street was deserted far
away she heard the clatter of many run-
ning horses the frenzy of a man hunt
sounded in those galloping echoes the
turmoil of anger was in the sky the
earth itself gave forth the suggestion
of some dreadful portent icy fingers
seemed to chill the heart of the girl
and as homely entered the room she
threw herself upon his breast and clung
to him as would a little child

  there now honey he said nerv-
ously if it aint all right all ways i
homely hunter of ghost river



dont know a sure-enough sign of peace
why molly mary trouble has disap-
peared from all of us-all just like a may
morning were going to have rain
before a great while

  molly mary raised her face and
smiled through tears

  we sure are commented jerry i
heard a fellow say down the street that
the railroad agent just got a telegram
that its raining cats and dogs up in the
big yellow hills theyve had three
cloudbursts there already which washed
out two bridges and the water is head-
ing down ghost river in a wall eight
feet high just look at them clouds a-
rolling this way now

  a knock came on the door when
jeffries opened it a mexican boy gave a
letter to him the missive was ad-
dressed to homely hunter opening it
homely read the contents and with a
laugh handed the letter to jerry

  what is it demanded molly mary

  i reckon you better not know
honey replied ouigley

  if it has to do with homely ive
got a right to know homely and i are
to be married mister ouigley

  then read it yourself answered
the old man and gave the letter into the
girls hand you might as well start
early

  slowly molly mary read aloud

  both you and i cant live in this country
any more shes too small for the two of us
dont let the sun go down on you in clayton
and i dont mean perhaps ill be in town
and if i sees yoq on the street i starts shoot-
ing at the first squint

  who sent that inquired jeffries
incisively

  buck tedford replied molly
mary

  by this time remarked jerry
buck is sure heading out somewheres
with a real wholesale lot of trouble rid-
ing on his tail dont pay no attention
to that thing molly lets go down to
supper

chapter xvii

dont go

the sun had set and a wan twilight
was in the air it had been a no-
sun day those who feasted at the ex-
pense of the town had now gone home
clayton was deserted save for a few
old men and many eager and anxious
women a few storekeepers saloon men
and loiterers a wind sobbed a wind
before rain it was it echoed in the
hollow spaces between houses it
boomed in the heart of molly mary as
she stood staring at the dim silhouette
of hills where the hurrying posse had
fled on the track of the escaped ruffians
out there where that grotesque mass of
shapes cut the evening glow like a horde
of repulsive beings more than two hun-
dred of the countys best horsemen were
searching for shorty ike smoky and
buck

  buck if that were true if only
buck were ahead of that sheriffs band
but she felt that he was not far oft
she saw a flash another then three
more in an unbelievably quick succes-
sion she knew-apache fire signs v
dad mr quigley she cried
come here

  the men ran to her side and stared
from the window

  watch those signals she cried 
what are they

  injun signs no my signs said
jerry quickly and they reads we
go south meet us

  buck asked the girl is it
buck

  no not buck responded jerry
its my guess some hombres making
them signs for buck he dont putter
around with his fire like them fellers
bucks hiding out back this way maybe
hes gone up in the cedar brakes back
of town or out in the broken axle hills
but theres just one sure thing
what asked the girl staring at
homelys face as he came into the


western story magazine

 room from a meeting with fancy frank
 and kearney

   them fellers will never get away
 from that posse now

  why

   thems rattlesnake hills and the
 west side of em drops right off into
 mormon canon that means them fel-
 lers is sure enough trapped-rat-
 trapped whats the matter honey

   molly mary was scrutinizing the fea-
 tures of homely she did not hear
 jerrys anxiety nor did she feel the
 hand her father laid on her shoulder
 she was staring at a shallow light in
 hunters eyes at a peculiar twitch of
 the muscles of his left cheek

   leave us alone dad she said in a
 disconsolate tone i want to be alone
 with flomely

   come on jeff said jerry of
 -course they wants to be alone lets
 you and me go down the street

   no dont do that said homely
 in an ominous voice dont either of
 you-all go out of this hotel to-night
 why asked jeffries

   bucks in town announced home-
 ly and hes done a considerable
 amount of talking i reckon hes leap-
 ing wild with liquor by this time too i
 just wouldnt give him a chance
 come on said jerry well wait
 for you downstairs boy he added to
 homely

   whats wrong dear asked molly
 mary what has happened to make
 your face look like it does

  homely stared at the door as it
 closed after the old men my face my
 face he seemed to repeat the words
 like a man in a dream oh my face
 why sometimes my face gets that a
 way its funny about my face all
 sqee-geed with ugliness is that what
 you mean

   tell me spoke molly mary in a
 voice which mocked the beauty of her
 eyes tell me what has happened
 nothing except buck has been

down at the magpie saloon and he
makes his brags that hes a-going to
kill jerry and me as soon as he sees us
he blames jerry for everything that
went wrong with the race bucks hid-
ing out nobody knows where

  but why dont some of the men in
town catch him

  there aint no men in town to speak
of except that deputy from amarillo
a few of our hands and some of
bucks old friends looks like now as
if-as if i gotta leave you

  no cried molly mary throwing
her arms about homelys neck no
not that homely not that dear
why molly mary he replied you
wouldnt go for to want me to stay
cooped up like a setting hen when that
fellows prowling around and slinging
all kinds of talk about your dad and
me and jerry would you

  no not that way she cried
oblivious to his question i dont want
you on the street to-night in the
morning dear when the sheriff and his
posse come back then we can go out
and ridevhome nobody will know
nobody would blame you if you didnt
go out to-night cant you see that
youre not expected to hunt down this
man thats the sheriffs duty no-
body will criticize you nobody will ever
know

 ill know and youll know
honey

  all i want is you iiomely you i
dont care what people say or what they
think dont go promise me you wont
go

  there was silence-save for the howl
of the rising wind and the hollow echo
of walking feet along the wooden side-
walks these struck the ears of the
girl with a ghastly resonance she
turned and stared at the window her
lips moved she seemed to grow livid
and then to utterly blanch under the im-
pelling suggestion of that sound from
the street that light and catlike tread
homely hunter of ghost river



  promise me dear she repeated
through dry lips

  i cant do that he said i cant
do that

  not for me

  not for you or for me either i
couldnt do that molly mary its big-
ger than me this thing

  you mean you want to get even with
buck you mean you want to kill a
man and come to me with his blood on
your hands is that what you mean
the girl had become overwrought
launching into a tirade of accusation
dont you know that this is the biggest
instant of my life my very life think
of what it will mean to have murder
and marriage mixed in the very same
day the same instant oh homely
dont go out now

  she was clutching at him with her
beautiful hands fondling his cheeks
stroking his hair employing a prayer
an appeal a beseeching expression that
swept all timidity from her face and
eyes using in her fingers a soothing
movement which almost unmanned
hunter gently he took her hands and
held them over his heart

  listen honey he said sweetly and
she closed her eyes at the sound of his
voice at the rush of anticipation she
felt in his words i wouldnt any more
cause you to worry like you is than i
would think of sinking a knife in your
heart but this thing-everybody in
town knows that buck has beat that
posse he back-tracked big bill and
hes come here to do dirt to jerry and
me if i marries you and god knows
thats the big minute in my little life
id have to move away no matter
what else i would do afterwards this
here country would always remember i
was afraid to walk on the street
feared skecred silly of just one man
on the street after dark too i
couldnt hold up my head and after a
little while this gaunt and ghostly thing
would jump up and come a-tween i and

you youd look at me and see me
slinking in this here room my arms
about you sniveling like a little pup
cant you see i gotta be true to my
breeding  i gotta do what a man does
in a mans way when a mans up agin
the real thing in a young country like
this wheres a fellows grit -and his
honor is all thats left to him to throw
away or hold up so all men can see its
lily white and plumb clean i gotta
go and meet fancy frank and jimmy
i told em i would

  again came the sound of the walking
feet over the hollow boards molly
mary stared at the window motioning
with a slight nod that she wanted home-
ly to see who was making the sound

  he strode to the window and peered
from it boldly below in the street
he saw fancy frank walking up and
down glancing this way and that and
staring occasionally at the entrance to
the hotel he saw the blanched face of
a woman raised toward the window at
which he stood he caught a man in a
store door looking hard at fancy frank
then a vast revulsion swept him

  all the town was watching that hotel
door waiting for him to come out
watching the drama of his courage his
being seemed to grow numb then he
saw molly marys eyes she had mis-
understood what was raging in his
heart

  it was him she stated a fact as
though it were a question wasnt it
buck

  no he answered sharply its
fancy frank and hes waiting out
there parading up and down and run-
ning a risk of getting pot shot just to
give me a chance then i seen a
womans face peering from behind a
curtain and she saw me sneaking a look
out of this window and another fel-
low in a door was watching too
everybody waiting honey and now
i gotta go will ya give a fellow a little
kiss just to help him  his way


western story magazine

  if you go out that door norman
-she stumbled over his name and then
as though in palliation for the affront of
this formal tone she added-if you go
out that door and leave me to suffer ill
never see you again never do you
understand homely

  his reply came to her like an echo
then i wants these words to keep a-
ringing in your ears as long as you live
i couldnt be the sort of man you seem
to see if i was false to what i thinks
is right what you sees in me i dont
know and i been a-studying about that
too but whatever it is i know its
something mighty fine or you wouldnt
go for to give your dear little self away
to a pack rat like me unless you seen
me true blue if i was yellow i
wouldnt be fit to be a husband to you
no sir you just remembers that i
love you betterll my life but i couldnt
keep off this street one minute even if
i knew i had to give you up i aint
nothing but what the saddle pounded
into me and my riding has learned me
and the wind has drove under my skin
im just as i is and i cant sneak behind
the prettiest thing in my life to
hide away from the ugliest i gotta
meet it good-by honey for a little
while but dont you worry ill be
back i just know ill be back i got
that hunch

  homely molly mary screamed
and rushing toward the boy raised her
face and met his kiss with her lips

  and while he held her tightly to his
slender shape he felt her suddenly wilt
in his arms he withdrew his lips and
saw that she had swooned picking her
up he laid her on the bed loosened the
neck of her waist raised the window
high and then hurried downstairs
where he met jeffries

  molly marys fainted he said
you and jerry go  up and keep her
quiet ill be back in a little while if
im coming back if i dont then you-
two always be kind wont you

  boy said jerry stepping to his side
look out for a lady-gun up bucks
sleeve if you gets right close quarters
and watch him like a hawk watch his
shift he always moves a leg afore
he pulls a gun

  jeffries held out a hand which home-
ly grasped fervently and silently then
quickly he ran up the stairs

  im a-going with you said jerry
colonel you is needed up yonder
right now and if you wants to tickle
me pink you go up there and keep her
from worrying itll be all over in a
little while

  youre a big sorta little fella
homely

  you wouldnt have me do otherwise

  i know youre just perzactly my
kinda hombre boy and all i gotta
say is take care of yourself and shoot
slow and low good-by

ten minutes to live

v ex stood about in the magpie
saloon like automatons they
leaned against the side wall where both
doors could be readily seen they
waited they lounged they listened
back of the bar stood the keeper of the
resort polishing glasses before him
reclined fancy frank jim kearney
and the texas officer there was a low
hum of voices in a far corner the
gambling dev ices were stilled the gam-
blers sat idly smoking about their tables

  then every one became on the alert
footsteps grated on the gravel of the
street which was nothing more than a
road they pounded on the platform
before the saloon

  the door opened and in stalked
homely his eyes swiftly roamed
every face and form beneath that dim-
ly lighted ceiling and with a smile he
walked firmly to the bar

its sure my night to buy he
homely hunter of ghost river



laughed step up here all you sand-
eating cow-chasing thirst carriers its
my night to spill my money and the
winner pays  everybodys welcome
and this mahogany feels like plush
come on a fella would think some-
body had died

  men glanced at men one laughed
and then all moved toward the bar
when the glasses had been filled a gam-
bler proposed a toast

  to one sure-enough hard-riding de-
cent-living plumb-white cowboy he
said lets drink her down

  a door was suddenly flung back and
as all eyes turned at the sound buck
was seen standing just inside the room
he looked like a figure viewed in the
little end of a telescope then came
his voice

  you-all knows the code of this land
dont you

  homely took two steps away from
the men about him its your move
fella he said sharply yet with no sign
of anger or rancor in his words
start after your iron

  buck smiled and that expression be-
came a snarl i wasnt a-meaning just
that right now he said im a-com-
ing to that what i means is-the law
of this desert is that when a man drinks
with a man there wont be no shooting
under that roof now i craves to take
a drink with you kid a fare-thee-well
gargle of red-hot licker does that
gt

  youre as welcome as if you had the
smallpox said homely smiling
pour your poison its race money
whats paying for this seance drink
hearty and stay a long time

  a murmur ran throughout the men
fancy frank and jim stood away from
the others and it was noticed that each
of them loosened a belt that held a
gun

  buck approached the bar where
standing room was made for him and
without a word filled his glass this

he lifted and held high as his eyes
caught and fixed those of homely

  i heard what you spoke cincin-
nati  he said to the gambler who had
proposed the toast and im sure a-
swallowing this licker on top of them
words heres to a game kid maybe
guffawing loudly he put glass to lip
and the whisky vanished down his
throat in a single gulp other men
drank all but homely whose lips bare-
ly touched the glass the saloon man
threw away the whisky

  whats the game hunter ques-
tioned tedford

  im a-craving to find out just how
much nerve youve got ive drunk
your licker to a toast what i knows to
be a lie answered buck i knows
youre white-livered and low-down
but i wants all this town to know it
heres my proposition ill be walking
that street out there in just ten min-
utes ten minutes does you hear
ten minutes from the time i leave
go on homelys face was a sight
i aint a-missing a word or flicking a
ear and whats more im watching
that little old two-bit derringer you has
got up that leather-vest sleeve a man
what carries a gun where crooked gam-
blers carries a cold deck cant say noth-
ing whatll stampede my brains when
it busts into my ears ten minutes is
a long long time sometimes what
about this ten minutes of yours

in ten minutes if i catches you on
this street i starts shooting and you
can do the same is that agreeable
from that street came the sound of
voices hushed voices

  friends of yours asked homely
signifying with a nod that he had heard
the men outside are they waiting
for you

  yep just a few old podners wholl
see i gets a fair shake on this last lap
to-morrowll be another day and
maybe then no friends will do me much
good now i hankers for just one


western story magazine

whizzer with you if i cant get that
ill slide up and feed old jerry what
sure is his right medicine for ditching
me

  ill be out in ten minutes replied
homely and ill have a friend or
two with me just for to match yours

  my friends wont bother none of-
fered buck theys just old-timers
what believes a grudge ought to be
fought out and not tried out in a court-
room

  this kid will have friends buck
commented cincinnati just wrap that
up and remember it one of you boys
open that door and tell them hombres
outside that when this ten minutes is up
there hadnt better be no man a-loafing
around this house this kid gets away
from the magpie clean and only one
man takes a shot at him

  a faro dealer opened a door and
spoke quietly to a group of men stand-
ing in the shadow of a blacksmith shop
there came a voice which fancy frank
recognized that voice assured the in-
mates of the magpie that the men out-
side were there for no other purpose
than to see that buck was given a
square deal the door closed

 that was raton harry
announced fancy and you can tie to
what he says set your watch with
that there clock buck we moves
when the times up and she starts
when you shuts that door

  buck examined his watch adjusted
it replaced it in a pocket backed toward
the door and vanished

  some one gave vent to a click of
laughter it sounded like an affront
and every eye found the offender

  jim kearney dropped an elbow on
the bar and moved a forefinger up and
down the polished mahogany fancy
frank talked in a low tone to cincinnati
men moved away from the little cluster
about homely and one or two sat down
and rolled cigarettes the sound of
the saloon keeper washing glasses rang

with a silvery tone in the room a
windowpane rattled and the wind
moaned

  old podner said kearney i just
wish somehow youd let me go on with
this thing

  homely heard the look in his eye
chilled kearney

  oh i knows exclaimed jim
jerry told me all about it told me
all about it after supper

  about what asked homely ab-
sently

  about you and miss jeffries now
if anything was to happen to you itd
well nigh break her heart dont you
think just this once you could let a
buddy step up and shoot this thing out 
them fellers outside would agree to it
and make buck stand for it-if they
knew about you and this here girl
cant i

  homely waved a negative with his
head then he smiled and dropped an
arm about kearneys shoulders you
knew bettern to ask me that jim he
drawled you old hound you knew
bettern all that

  ill do it then cried cincinnati
you aint a-going to run no such risk
if theres a girl a-waiting for you let
me do this homely ill be glad to
turn a trick like this why-the game-
ster smiled with thin pallid lips an ex-
quisitely serene light dancing in his eyes
-doing such a thing as that might
square a lot of mean stuff ive slung
about in my life id sure be obliged if
youd let me take your place and im
right fast too

  thank you old pilgrim said
homely but you see buck and i just
didnt like each other from the first time
we met his hating me aint because
i beat him at that race or because i
wounded his skin no sir its deepern
all that when two men hates each
other its deepern acts and stronger
than motives its bedded down in the
brain and its gnawing all the time at
homely hunter of ghost river



a man bucks been mad at me ever
since i made a monkey outa him when
he tried to make a fool outa me boys
shes got to go as she lays two min-
utes has gone byf

  now if you-all dont mind some of
you spills along and sees that i have got
a free street in front of me when the
times up please jimmy you and
fancy and cincinnati and you deputy
too you fellows amble out and give me
just ten feet clear space in front of this
door now t wants to be alone a
while

  men poured from the saloon the
closing of the doors brought homely
up with a jerk only the ticking clock
could be heard this and the faint puf-
fing of a cigarette by the man back of
the bar-the puffing of a cigarette
which had gone out

  homely was insensible to what was
going on about him all he could think
of was the lifeless colorless lovely face
of molly mary as he had seen it last
the saloon man spoke to him but he
did not hear

  the glory of youth was in his eyes
and melancholy was in his heart-
anguish that hardened keeper of the
saloon who had seen death parade be-
fore his eyes many times who had dealt
death himself on occasions now quailed
before the sight of homelys face

  somehow hunter radiated some ab-
horrent quality his shoulders twisted
his neck cords twitched his nostrils
whitened his blue lips drew in at their
corners he looked like a pilloried
soul a spirit that was on the rack of
some ugly and evil thought

  have you looked at your gun
asked the saloon man

  huh  queried homely rousing and
half pulling his six-gun from its sheath
thats all right he smiled i was
thinking of something else-somebody
else

  his mouth became tasteless his
forehead worked and a clammy damp

came upon it which he felt impelled to
wipe away rub away cleanse away as
one would clease off an evil and de-
testable smear a flush made a pale
crimson take the place of his facial
tan then a shiver assailed him a
shiver which was more of a convulsion
than anything one could have called it
he had a paroxysm of rebellion as
though a loathing had flooded his rea-
son

  would a drink steady you asked
the bar man

  i dont drink replied homely and
i wouldnt now under no case

  i was glad when you set down that
glass a while ago replied the resort
proprietor youre all right sticking
sober

  a gust of wind drove around a cor-
ner both men stared at the lighted
street where the sifting sand through
the windows appeared like visible wind

  shes going to bust announced the
saloon man rain-and one whale of
a lot of it too i knows rain signs
yep answered homely staring at
the clock them clouds all day sure
meant a heap five minutes aint
that what you make it five minutes
left

  five minutes the man back of the
bar repeated as he looked at the time-
piece on the wall you got plenty of
time now get all set and on your
first sally pass up the street and get
that wind hitting you slantwise dont
look into it that is dont look it
plumb in the face the flying sand
might fill your eyes

  i reckon i gotta take the first thing
buck does to locate him replied
homely i gotta let him crack down
first then build up whatever is on my
mind after that

  there was an automatic phonograph
on the bar one of the old cylinder
kind this new asked homely this
talking machine seen one at medicine
bow last year


western story magazine

  yep operates with a coin in that
there slot wanna hear it

  homely grinned the man dropped
a nickel in the slot and a loud rasping
issued from the machine-then the
strains of open thy lattice love
homely grew pale and seemed to totter

  if i gets mine out there he said
weakly you look on this here do-ding-
ess and when you find the name of this
song you write a note to miss molly
mary jeffries and tell her that you and
i was a-listening to the song just before

i stepped out that door tell her-

  wanna write a note

  nope just tell her i was a-think-
ing of her while the music was playing
on and you tell her podner that i
was sure a-hating what i got to do tell
her that i reckon you knows i aint a-
shaking just because of what i thinks is
going to hit me does you you knows
i aint skeered of buck dontcha
yep i knows all that but i sure
wishes youd kinda settle down and not
do so much thinking it might slow up
your shooting some

  homely straightened stared at the
clock and to the utter amazement of
the saloon man quieted to a calm which
was as vast a change as his trepidation
had been but a moment before

  adios he smiled hitching up his
belt shes eight minutes and i reckon
t better be on the move

  he pulled open the door and stepped
through it silently leisurely he
glanced about him not a human being
could he see nothing but the dim shad-
owy images of building fronts through
the driving mists of the dust faintly
a lighted window caught and held his
vision then a curtain was pulled and
the illumination of the window was
flecked away like magic

  up the street he walked slowly dog-
gedly his hat brim flattened against the
crown by the savagery of the air the
driving pellets of grit stinging his face
in smarting jets of pain the quiet

which dwelt in the body of that howling
air had a loathsome quality about it
it was like an omen

  now he was in the middle of the
street

  a beating powerful gust of wind
hurled the sand into a cloud that rolled
down upon him like some grotesque
monster then as he gained the oppo-
site walk and was heading along it the
dust lifted was jerked aside as a stage
curtain is parted before a lighted
building he saw fancy frank stand-
ing watch in hand his voice came

  forty-five seconds

  three menacing words-it was like
the knell of doom the tones of the
voice held within themselves some note
or quality which homely did not asso-
ciate with frank they seemed foreign
even to any human voice

  once more the wind shut out the
vision of fancy

  then against the far swirl of sickish
light at the corner a shape appeared
a shambling gray form like that of a
pictured ghost it appeared it van-
ished it came on and on and on it
grew at last into the slithering image of
bucks form suddenly it was blotted
out

  and when the air cleared and a wan
but penetrative illumination spread
everywhere from the upflung curtains
in a group of houses tedford was no-
where to be seen homely strolled on
his senses were alive they hurt with
their keenness they dulled all functions
but the quality of sight and the gnaw
of strain he became the heir of intui-
tion

  now this time homely recog-
nized fancys voice

  something jerked at homelys hip
where his ornamental leather belt hung
about his waist then before his eyes
a long streak of light flashed out of the
smother of dust and those other lights
cast from the lamps of houses a bite
of pain followed it stabbed where the
homely hunter of ghost river



leather belt hung homely gritted his
teeth and his right hand instinctively
jerked at his colt

  even while his fingers pulled the
heavy weapon from its long sheath a
thumb lifted its immense hammer the
muzzle tilted and swung to the spot
where the flame had bit into the night
the men in the shadows watched in a
charmed daze

  once more a whining noise went past
homelys head then his gun spoke
and a long wraithlike form leaped out
of the mist and into the shaft of a
struggling light it was buck tedford 
he tottered caught his legs stiffened
and once more fired but the missile
went wild slowly he began to settle
and even as he fell his gun barked
homely spun upon a heel and would
have fallen had not his agile left foot
shot back to an unconscious propping
position

  but the movement awoke a deathly
agony in his waist a sharp torture in
the region of his shoulder cautiously
as he felt his faculties slipping from
him as though each infinitesimal beat
of time were a treasure he lifted his
gun and steadied it against his thigh
from this angle as he saw bucks leg
shift on the earth and caught the sheen
of a metal object coming from out the
mist without obvious aim he released
the hammer of his gun he saw bucks
form slump as though a log had been
dropped on it when he fired slowly
walking toward the man in the dirt
homely saw bucks fingers twitching
making ineffectual efforts to grasp the
 which lay just beyond their reach
then bucks shoulder wrenched a
shiver ran throughout his frame and
a boot fell flat upon another boot a
hand was half hidden in a sleeve for
an instant hunter stared at the figure
below his eyes then he turned about
where he had last seen fancy

  thats all i reckon he cried i
hit the poor devil both times now i

guess ill be moving up to the hotel
you boys better get all the names of
any folks what seen this hadnt you
i reckon ill have to talk to the law 
he was gone

  jim kearney fancy frank cincin-
nati the deputy sheriff from amarillo
and a small clot of other men gathered
about buck tedford one of the men
rolled him on his back and silently
pointed to the spots in his shirt which
were now changing from a garish color
to a dull and dirty smudge

  cincinnati muttered that kid
some of you boys out that a way go
and help him along look how hes
dragging that leg

  homely had reached the porch of the
hotel by the aid of two men when
molly mary flung wide the door and
ran toward him with outstretched arms

 my homely she cried my
homely

  i come back like i said i would
didnt i honey he gasped

  then he fell forward molly marys
arms around him two cowboys tenderly
catching him and breaking the fall a
great booming rang in his ears all
sight was blotted out the last mem-
ory he had was of that creaking
squawking talking machine grinding
out open thy lattice love
when they carried him to a room a
smile had made a lovely shape out of
his malformed face

chapter xix
alls well

down the street cincinnati was
holding forth in loud harangue to
a mob of women and children aided in
his narrative by the men who had wit-
nessed the shooting

  i reckon concluded the gambler
turning to the sheriffs man from
texas that what you seen in this
street was pretty much what took place
back in your town when them fellows


western story magazine

tried to put the kid away what you
going to try to do now take him
back

  swell chance exclaimed the
deputy i seen what he done and i
wants to tell you people here that if it
hadnt been for a big drop of rain
homely would be laying out there in
the dust right now

  a drop of rain some one asked

  yes a big drop of rain i was
standing in that doorway and not fifteen
feet from buck when fancy called
now and i seen buck lift his gun
what was ready in his hand just then
a drop of rain smacked that hand right
where the thumb and forefinger makes
a valley i seen it shimmer in a ray of
lamplight and i seen buck wince as
though somebody had hit him from be-
hind that was the shot that hit home-
ly in the side that drop of rain sure
did a big big trick and speaking of
rain here she comes

  the rain fell in blankets it filled the
air as the dust had filled the wind
then the storm died and nothing
could be heard but-the pitiless fall of
the large drops hitting the earth like
blows it dropped all night it fell all
the early morning it continued on into
middle afternoon

  then it stopped and into town came
the sheriff and his posse bringing in
ike witherspoon and shorty as prison-
ers and smoky evans body the peo-
ple were mad with joy the town was
a seething spot of wild hysterical gos-
sip and the hotel in which lay homely
hunter a center of deepest anxiety

  throughout it all homely hunter
lay in bed weak from his wounds and
by the bed sat molly mary sat and
watched and prayed no persuasion
advice or logic could close her eyes in
rest or make her give up that immobile
staring at the face that had now become
beautiful to her

  oregon pete made the first out-
sider visit to homely and the old

horse trainer gabbled like a child
molly mary had met him in the hall
telling him that homely could have a
caller or two but that the doctor had
instructed her to prevent hunter from
an excess of conversation so oregon
pete talked in a veritable hysteria

  that mare he said just before he
left homely she ran that distance in
fourteen minutes and twelve seconds
five watches caught her exact now i
can lay down and die i seen norfolk
a four year old with a hundred pounds
up at sacramento california septem-
ber rd  do three miles in 
and in - and i seen lady st
clair to a wagon pace five miles at
frisco december th  in 
but im telling you that with you at
your weight and that saddle and
blanket and over this course in this
heat annabel lee can beat any living
horse at that distance and in this alti-
tude and climate aint it a cryin
shame 

  whatta you mean-a shame  asked
homely

  that jerry and jeffries have buried
the hatchet thats the worst blow that
horse racing in the southwest ever had
it sure riles me to see them two hob-
nobbing around makes me sick now
i gotta go back to oregon and spend a
hundred days a year in the rain

  ah pete said homely smiling
thats all right its a dry spot of rain
though plumb full of climate and
health

  here comes some more i better be
moving said pete

  the deputy from amarillo big bill
walton fancy frank jim kearney
and cincinnati came into the room
the look on their faces was a marvelous
thing the solicitude and tenderness
with which they regarded homely was
as expressive of love as that of any
woman could have been

  it might perk you up a bit podner
said jim to listen to what this loafing
homely hunter of ghost river



sheriff man from texas laid over to tell
you

  you bet i laid over the deputy
laughed ike witherspoon shorty
fanton and menifee have sure told me
a tale and ive got it down in black and
white

  im taking ike and shorty back
to amarillo and on the strength of this
confession were all ready to indict
them for the killing of your dad ike
and shorty did the shooting while jake
the marshal lured your dad out on a
lonely road menifee tied up all the
missing links in that evidence which
exonerates you and makes jims use of
the gun a righteous act theyve
quashed the indictment against you
flow come them fellers to talk that
a way asked homely

  the night we got in with them
spoke big bill walton a mob of the
boys helped us get that confession it
was-tell us a story or be fed out to
that mob i wish you could have seen
them yellow hounds they couldnt
spread their talk fast enough

  did you get smoky evans

  get him cried big bill til say
we got him one of my deputies
dropped him with a - when he
started to shoot at me when i walked
forward to put the bracelets on ike and
shorty that saved some place a lot
of money

  sure looks like what that old friend
of mine told me was the plumb truth
remarked homely reminiscently

  braid your loop cowboy fancy
frank smiled ill bite what did the
old friend say

  you gotta hit the bottom before
you starts to bounce replied homely

 then molly mary came into the
room boys she said kindly i
know you-all love homely but you
must go now ties had enough to
make him do a lot of thinking to-
morrow you can stay a little longer
in a week hell be sitting in a chair

  you see how it is fellows dont
you said homely smiling i gotta
boss now and it wont be long afore
ill be branded and headed into a pew
pen where ill say i do and t will
and a long-faced black-coated trail boss
to heaven will pronounce the sentence
i better start obeying good-by and
good luck and for petes sake come
back all of you

  as the men filed from the room
homely called the deputy from ama-
rillo to his bedside what will you fel-
lows do with ike and shorty he
asked

  if you wants to push it well hang
em

  i dont want that said homely
seeking molly marys eyes i dont
want to think of them things when im
trying to make this little lady think
that im something sane when i aint
nothing but a crazy sorta canary gone
singing wild with love let em plead
guilty and take a sentence in the pen
i wont be back to your town man and
i dont want no hanging i wanna for-
get

  if they pleads announced the
deputy the judge will give them
enough to last this life and lap over a
little on the next

  molly marys face beamed its
because of that quality in homely that
i love him so she said just that
surprising sort of thing

  the deputy couldnt speak

  when the door was closed and they
were alone molly mary laid her face
beside homelys cheek

  two weeks from to-day and well
show you a sight she said

  what kinda sight

  never mind thats for you to find
out and think about

  if i could just have you over
yonder where i could feast my eyes on
you and pinch myself at the same time
thats about all the sight ill be crav-
ing

  molly mary in mock petulance arose
from his side and pulled a rocking-chair
before him

  softly quietly in a bird-twittering
voice she crooned open thy lattice
love homely closed his eyes but
at the completion of the ballad he
opened them and said just afore i

walked out of the magpie-

  ssssh whispered molly mary go
to sleep i know all about that lanky
hank the keeper of the magpie told
me what you said to him as his old talk-
ing machine was grinding out that tune
ive got the cylinder wrapped up in tis-
sue now on our wedding day lanky
is going to present me with the con-
trivance to make the music

  when is this said nuptials asked
homely laughing

  when a certain cowboy can fork his
horse and do a ten-mile ride with me
oh oh honey said homely now
watch me get well

  the wedding took place on horseback
on the very edge of the precipice which
overlooked the bow in the letter s
bend of ghost river the preacher
was jimmy engles the cowboy minister
from socorro who made the trip to the
lazy shield bar in the saddle and was
given a fee which would enable him to
build a church among a tribe of in-
dians where he had long wanted to
settle

  when the last of the words were
spoken and the congratulations of the
crowd bad been wildly given jeffries
and jerry moved their ponies to home-
lys side jerry said come on i
wanna show you something

  through the trees went the crowd
following the bridegroom and the two
old men molly mary and the preacher

riding back of these when the oppo
site side of the hill was reached homely
stopped his horse in complete consterna-
tion there below him a wide and
long and shimmering stretch of water
met his gaze

  huh he cried who did this

  old ghost river must of busted
through this hill that night you wa
battling against bucks  bullets an-
nounced jerry jim kearney and
fancy frank riding this way had to
make a detour of ten miles to get by the
overflow when the flood passed i and
jeff we put a gang of men to work and
dammed up the thing inside o two
months and well have a first-class stor-
age lake and a real cement spillway
then well let the water out as you
wants it

  as i wants queried homely
whats eating you jerry

  yes you cried jeffries jerry
and i have thrown our two ranches into
one and youre boss from this time on
you can grow anything on that bottom
now even little homelys

  homely couldnt speak tear welled
into his eyes and turning his horse
about he motioned molly mary to fol-
low him behind a clump of juniper
the girl patted his shoulder and restored
his poise

  a mexican orchestra burst into
music there came a rattle of pistol
shots and then oregon pete cincin-
nati fancy and jim kearney rode up
and escorted molly mary and homely
through the trees to a spot where a
great barbecue was under way

  dog-gone honey cried homely
racing away with molly mary come
on lets show this crowd irs just
you and me from this time on just
you and me-two against the world

the end

author of plenty grub an plenty goldetc

ay be greener men have
hit alasky-but i doubt
it

  the speaker a rheumy-
eyed old veteran of the
trails spoke thus dispar-
agingly of young harris benton the
old-timers perpetual sun-grin ex-
panded visibly as he watched bentons
parka-clad figure disappear around a
bend in the river trail

  wonder how long hell last the
old fellow speculated turning to the
group on the river bank ill bet ive
showed him a dozen times how to tie
his snowshoes to his feet an ive told
him little things about pitchin his tent
and makin camp till im black in the
face itll be three-four weeks yet be-
fore mushinll be any good but ive
got a right good notion to load up the
old yukon sled an take out after that
young chechahco

  an why

  the old-timer had paused for that
query the question certainly gave pith
and point to the clever thing on the

tip of his tongue the remark would
have lost its savor in the telling the
retort however was pungent

  an why he repeated ill tell
you for why ive been snow-blind
twice so my eyes aint what they used
to be nowadays when i aint wear in
snow glasses-an blast the dang things
i hate em-ive got to keep my eyes
clamped on the spruce

  spruce is dang restful to the eyes
its restful because its green but to
keep on lookin at it a mans got to
twist his head from one side the river
to the other an theres times when
i think im lible to twist my head
plum off-like a screech owl now
instead of takin all that trouble i could
start out an foller after this young
benton instead of lookin at the
spruce then i could keep my eyes fas-
tened straight ahead on him hes
greener than any spruce that ever
growed

  if young harris benton could have
heard this sarcastic speech he would
have been rudely made aware of the


western story magazine

withering contempt in which he was
held by the general run of alaskans
with whom he had come in contact
had he been aware of the feeling which
existed he would not have been
offended in the least he would have
been amused he was green but un-
like many greenhorns he realized the
fact and was anxious to learn more-
over he was willing to accept the hard
knocks-a part of the curriculum of
alaskas trail school-and come up
smiling for harris benton although
he was probably the greenest chechahco
in the north had not been raised a pet

  at noon young benton hauled his
sled to the river bank and with con-
siderable difficulty dropped a dead
spruce tree and built a small tea fire
after his noon meal he unloaded his
yukon sled inverted it so that the steel-
shod runners shone like twin mirrors
in the rays of the sun then-and this
is almost past believing-he proceeded
to smear the steel shoes of the sled run-
ners with lubricating oil

  the dealer who had sold him the
oil-either unscrupulous or a practical
joker-had seriously informed him that
greased sled runners makes mighty-
easy slippin on the trail harris ben-
ton had innocently bought five gallons
of the lubricant

  where a musher pulls without dogs
as young benton was doing every
pound of excess weight is an additional
check to his progress and besides the
five gallons of lubricating oil harris
benton was hauling other nonesscntials
he had more clothing than he really
needed about twenty pounds of books
and old magazines and the merchant
from whom he had bought his outfit
had sold him far too many cooking
utensils bentons entire outfit weighed
almost twelve hundred pounds and
since at best he could haul but four
hundred pounds on his yukon sled he
was relaying he would haul from
three to four hundred pounds as far

up the river trail as he could possibly
travel in a day cache his load and re-
turn to his camp with his empty sled

 early in the month of may he
reached the kentna country he had
been on the trail four months and he
had arrived with pick pan and shovel
together with ample food to last him
through the mining season also-as
every old-timer in the kentna country
will testify-he had arrived with the
ambition and energy of a half dozen
men in spite of the grueling work on
the trail

  young benton spent his first week
after arriving at the cricks in build-
ing a cache for his supplies it was a
simple box affair built of logs sup-
ported high in air by four posts he
was busily stowing his food and other
supplies in the cache when a voice at
his elbow brought him about with a
start looking up from his work he
saw the old-timer who had offered him
many helpful suggestions back at the
trading post the old man was survey-
ing him his small stock of provisions
and his crude cache with frank curios-
ity

  well i see you landed here all
right he remarked by way of greet-
ing im camped just above here on
penny ante crick an i aint got a
thing to do till the snow goes off so
i thought id mush over an see how
youre gettin along staked yourself
a claim yet

  benton admitted that he had not i
didnt know it was lawful to stake a
claim unless you discover gold he
added

  plenty of em stakes first an find
the gold afterward-if theres any to
be found the old mans rheumy eyes
were mildly disapproving i wouldnt
worry too much about makin my dis-
covery if i was you most any gravel
you find around here carries some gold
trouble is to find it in payin quanti-
ties so hurry up an stake yourself
greener than spruce



a claim or two before some of these
ground hogs comes in on the first boat
this summer an grabs it all us old-
timers takes just what we can work
to good advantage but most green-
hornsll wear out a pair of hobnail
shoes just a-racin over the country
stakin youre lucky to be here among
the first so hurry up an get busy

  thanks for the tip ill-

  its none of my business the old-
timer suddenly interrupted but what
in thunder have you brought into the
country in that

  benton had placed his five-gallon can
of lubricating oil near the cache and
it was that which had elicited the ques-
tion he was somewhat puzzled

  why thats my oil he said how
do you carry yours

  the ancient sour dough had all he
could do to keep a straight face this
green chechahco had actually brought
kerosene into this wilderness

  you wont have no use for a lamp
he said gently all summer you can
read fine print right in your tent-any
hour of the night too i thought evry-

body knowed-

  i have no lamp young benton in-
terrupted impatiently im green but
im not quite a fool-i hope that
isnt oil for a lamp its about four gal-
lons of lubricating oil that i had left
over from my winters sledding

  i see the old man shifted his
weight from one moccasined foot to the
other swallowing his adams apple
twice before he once more found his
voice i understand you but i dont
know what you mean he said how
much of this oil did you use an how
did you use it

  well i used about a gallon young
benton was looking doubtfully at the
old man i think i see what youre
driving at now i allowed that store-
keeper to sell me five gallons when one
was all that i needed

  the old-timer lifted his tufted eye-

brows an you got through the win-
ter with one gallon he said softly
wonderingly

  why i only used it in the morning
and again at noon just when i-but
maybe i didnt use it often enough
still the sled came along pretty well

  the old-timer barked apologetically
in his mittened hand at last he un-
derstood it had been so many years
since he had heard of the old joke of
greasing sled runners that he had for-
gotten but this boy was so very much
in earnest it wouldnt do to hurt his
feelings and besides it might lead to
serious trouble this innocent youth
had dragged this worthless stuff over
the trail-pounds and pounds of it
murder had been committed for less
than a joke like that

  the skinflint sold you too much all
right he said as he reached down and
thoughtfully hefted the can but
youve got it here-i reckon you might
as well forget it anyhow you wont
have any more use for it youre all
through sleddin xn now id better
be gettin along if you want anything
this summer youll find me over on
penny ante crick number five above
discoverys the name of my claim

  harris benton was highly elated
when he next saw the old-timer not
only had he staked a claim on what he
called benton gulch but he had actu-
ally discovered gold and he had found
it in paying quantities for a week he
had panned the gravel on benton gulch
and he was now displaying his sample
to the old-timer the old man listened
attentively to the boys story but did
not enthuse over the sample

  youve come clean over here to
penny ante crick to show me this an
im right sorry to have to disappoint
you in spite of the old mans words
young benton was grinning cheer fully
it takes a whole lot to discourage a
young rooster like you he resumed
but ill soon show you why youve


western story magazine

got to leave that gulch alone i dont
doubt what you say you got the gold
here to prove it but howre you goin
to work the ground answer me that
harris benton still grinned i know
why you think i cant work that
ground he said its what you old-
timers call a dry gulch i know there
wont be drinking water there this sum-
mer what you overlooked is this by
digging a ditch less than a quarter mile
in length i can get one of the best
sluice heads in this country right
over that shoulder at the head of my

gulch is where i-

  t know where you mean all right
interrupted the old-timer but have
you talked with joe mur try yet
havent even seen him but why
should i talk to him what has he
to do with it

  evrything joe murtry owns evry
drop of water in caribou crick he
recorded it last spring a year ago
young benton was on the point of
interrupting but the old-timer silenced
him now dont start to tell me that
ail youve got to do is to go over to
caribou crick an get joe murtry to
give you the right to take what water
you want for joe aint that kind he
aint only the luckiest man in alasky-
hes the meanest if hes worth a dime
hes worth a half million right now but
even so he wouldnt give a man day-
light in a dark cellar you just forget
you ever staked a claim on that little
gulch an start out prospectin for some-
thing thatll do you some good

  young benton thanked the old man
for his advice but he added im
not going to start out prospectin when
ive already discovered gold-unless
im forced to do so im going over
to see murtry at once

  all right but be ready to run if
he comes at you hes the meanest
man in alasky bar none joe murtry
never done no man a favor an he never
will mark what  tell you son hell

chase you off his ground just as soon
as you show up an tell him what you
want youre just wastin your time
but then thats the trouble with all
chechahcos they wont listen to an old-
timers advice

  young benton went at once to car-
ibou creek in spite of what he
had heard of joe murtry he was
not convinced there was an abun-
dance of water in caribou creek
and surely  man would be
mean enough to refuse to allow the
use of the surplus this line of rea-
soning gave him great confidence but
his first glimpse of murtry caused his
heart to sink

  murtry was not tall but he was as
broad as two average-sized men yet
he was not fat his arms were unusu-
ally long and due to a slight stoop to
his powerful shoulders his huge hands
hung slightly ahead of his knees
young benton looked at him and in-
stantly thought of a gorilla with two
others murtry was setting up a string
of sluice boxes

  benton watched them for a time
twice without waiting to be asked he
gave them a hand murtry who had
barely spoken paused at last and sized
up his caller what he saw evidently
satisfied him

  want a job he asked gruffly pm
taking one of these men upriver to-
morrow air if youre lookin for work
you can stay here an help sam do
whatever he tells you

  here was a golden opportunity
surely if he favored murtry he might
expect the big fellow to reciprocate
im not looking for work for the sea-
son he said but ill be glad to help
out for a few days-if that will do you
any good

  murtry grunted all i need he
said ive got a foreman an fifteen
men waitin for me upriver they
mush in from the coast-their time
starts the first of june whether theyre

here or not hunderd an fifty miles
from here im goin up in my boat
an bring em down you stay an help
sam out till i come back with my men
an ill pay you the goin wages-ten
bucks an grub

  sam soon shuffled off to cook the eve-
ning meal and benton decided to say
nothing about his sluice head of water
until after they had eaten their pipes
going he thought it time to broach the
subject

  i didnt tell you that i was a neigh-
bor of yours he said by way of open-
ing the conversation i spent the win-
ter sledding in my outfit

  that so murtry said with a mild
simulation- of interest where you
camped 

  benton indicated the direction
right over there he said ive named
it benton gulch

  you aint staked that little dry
gulch

  why yes you see i believe theres
a little gold there-i dont know how
much-ive already done quite a bit of

panning and i hope to-

  youre a fool murtry interrupted
in a rage if you dont know that i
own evry drop of water in caribou
crick its time you was learnin how
do you aim to work that gulch without
water 

  thats what i came over to see you
about said benton i heard that it
was your water and i thought that you
would be glad to spare me a sluice
head benton was speaking calmly in
spite of the others belligerent attitude
of course he went on if the water
in caribou crick should run low this
summer or fall id quit taking it out
but-

  youd quit takin it out murtry
cried youre never goin to begin
takin it out if yon ever start mon-
keyin with caribou crick ill drill

you so full of holes youll look like-

murtrys anger was intensified by his

failure to find the word he was seek-
ing say he cried you get clean
off this claim beat it quick while
youre all together

  benton was sitting at the rough table
he rose slowly why certainly-if its
your claim-ill leave he was speak-
ing hesitantly but he was not afraid of
the glowering bully who had com-
manded him to leave he was simply
surprised at the mans unreasonable
anger but even if i have no water
that gulch belongs to me and i mean
to hold it

  hold it as long as you want to
murtry was shouting after him hold
it till you get good an tired of doing
assessment work on it wait a min-
ute till i tell you something youd just
as well know now as later benton
paused and murtry continued there
aint any gold in that gulch but even if
there was youd never get to work it
ive got the water an i aim to keep it
the old-timer was right he was
right about everything he had said
that joe murtry was the meanest man
in alaska he had said that no matter
how much gold the tiny gulch might
carry murtry would never allow it to
be worked benton considered the
various things that the old-timer had
told him until he reached his camp in
benton gulch well he decided he
would follow the old mans advice and
quit the gulch on the following day

  benton had been prospecting the
gulch every day for more than a week
through force of habit he took his
pick shovel and gold pan and went to
work in the narrow cut which he had
been running into a shoulder of the hill
near his tent he was far from an ex-
pert with the gold pan but he enjoyed
the beginners thrill which always came
when he tailed off the residue in the
pan and saw the streak of yellow
trickling behind the black sand

  young benton extended his cut three
feet into the hill he was following


western story magazine

along the disintegrated slate bed rock
although he did not realize it the bed-
rock was totally different before it
had been slick now it was rough and
rotten

  he filled his pan with gravel and
carried it to a hole which he had dug
in the gulchs channel now the hole
was filled with water from the melting
snows in a week perhaps it would be
dry at least the old-timer had said
that it would and benton was now a
firm believer in the wisdom of the old
man

  it is a maxim with old-timers that
many things are mistaken for gold but
gold is never mistaken for anything
else a greenhorn is often fooled for
example by iron pyrites and cube
iron but when he discovers gold the
real thing he knows so it was with
benton for a week he had been pan-
ning pinhead stuff that would rat-
tle in the pan now as he tailed
off the pan he had taken from the dis-
integrated bed rock he saw that a half-
dozen dull-yellow pieces of gold were
in the bottom of the pan bentons old-
timer would have pronounced them
slugs

  benton was excited he held the
slugs in the palm of his hand while he
attempted to estimate their value the
smallest of them he decided was fully
twice as large as a five-dollar gold piece
the largest was surely worth more than
twenty dollars the six slugs would
total almost a hundred dollars che-
chahco that he was benton still knew
that he had uncovered bonanza dirt

  young benton went again to his cut
this time he worked feverishly for two
hours his pay streak was rich ex-
tremely so but there was a heavy over-
burden to handle in other words
above the pay he had discovered on bed
rock lay ten twenty possibly as much
as fifty feet of muck and gravel un-
doubtedly the ground was rich enough
that he could take out hundreds of dol-

lars that summer without water but if
he could only manage to get that sluice-
head from caribou creek he could
with a pressure hose run that over-
burden off like so much soup he must
have that water j but how 

  at five oclock next morning young
benton was seated on the stump of a
spruce where the clear waters of car-
ibou creek gushed into the brown
foam-flecked river he looked at mur-
trys river boat which was beached near
by it rested on two fresh-peeled logs
and benton saw that all preparations
had been recently made to launch the
vessel at six oclock murtry and one
of his men put in an appearance ben-
ton had no time to lose he spoke to
murtry at once

  murtry he said without rising
from his stump ive been thinking
the matter over and i wonder if you
would consider selling me a sluice head
of water from caribou crick ill pay
you what it is worth

  murtry paid him no attention he
and his man put their shoulders at the
stern of the boat and skidded the vessel
into the river murtry made a line fast
to a convenient dead man while his
man leaped into the stern of the boat
and started the engine no sooner did
he have the engine purring rhythmically
than he shut it off

  whats the matter murtry who
was about to cast off and leap aboard
made the line fast again anything
wrong with that engine

 no but- the man was look-
ing at murtry in wide-eyed alarm he
was afraid to tell what was wrong and
yet he dared not remain silent mr
murtry he said speaking swiftly as
if anxious to break the news as quickly
as possible there aint a single drop
of engine oil i spoke to sam about
it last night after wed loaded the other
stuff aboard an he said there was plen-
ty of oil here but i just looked an
theres nothin but gasoline theres
greener than spruce



more gasoline than we need but there
aint a drop of-

  you idiot murtry exclaimed
chase right up to camp an get some
out of the cache an hurry

  mur trys man leaped ashore but
stood hesitantly shifting his feet as if
in a quandary

  hurry i dont want to wait here
all day

  ill go look again but i looked last
evenin an there wasnt any there at
least i didnt see it thats why sam
was so sure there was plenty on the

boat

  of course its there if you dont
find it in the cache look in the tool
shed

  at this the man shuffled off young
benton was much pleased at murtrys
unexpected delay but he was some-
what nettled at the manner in which he
had been ignored he decided to try
again and this time he would do his
utmost to make murtry answer him

  i suppose you didnt hear me a bit
ago he began but-

  i heard you the first time murtry
interrupted with an oath now shut
your yap an get out

  benton did not move seeing this
murtrys great hamlike hands twisted
about convulsively his lips drew back
against his uneven teeth and with an
enraged snarl he quickly rushed at the
louth

  ill show you if you move or not
he shouted once i get a hold of you
ill-

  murtry suddenly brought up with a
sharp exclamation ten feet from ben-
ton he had stopped with an exprescon
of bewilderment on his broad face he
was gazing like a man fascinated into
the barrel of an automatic

  i came ready for you said young
benton coolly im not on your claim
and i dont see you or anybody else
throwing me off of government land
and now you can at least listen to

  what i have to say even if you dont
care to-

  ill listen you young pup murtry
said but theres a day cornin youll
wake up some day an learn that what
i say goes in this neck of the woods

  murtry advanced a step as he said
this and you said benton as he
menaced murtry with his weapon may
never wake up if you come another
step in this direction there thats bet-
ter he went on as murtry retreated
a step from what ive been told
murtry youre a mighty rich man it
wont bother you in the least to sell-
or give me for that matter-some of
your water youve got your pile made
now be decent and give me a chance
to get out of this country with a little
money for all the hardship ive gone
through will you listen to a sensible
proposition 

  rave on said murtry sullenly
youve got me dead to rights talk
away if it does you any good but youll
get nothin out of me

  ill give you a third of all the money
i take out said benton speaking
slowly and distinctly if youll give
me the water to work the ground is
it a go

  murtry opened his lips as if he in-
tended to reply then closed them
tightly a minute passed and he seemed
to reconsider you might as well trot
along he said contemptuously use
your brains why ivould i take a third 
if theres any money there i can have
it all after you starve out an if there
aint anything there whats the idee of
my takin a third

  benton said nothing more argu-
ment seemed such a futile thing so far
as murtry was concerned five min-
utes passed and murtrys man appeared
empty handed his manner was apol-
ogetic

  it aint there he said whining
an there aint any on the boat sam
or some of the other boys mustve used


western story magazine

  t all up last fall before the boat was
laid up i dont know what to do un-
less i mush up there an have the boys
come down in a boat or on a raft

  for almost a minute murtry raved
like a maniac an evry day that my
men stay up there its costin me a
hunderd an sixty-five dollars fie
groaned fifteen men at ten a day an
my foreman at fifteen a day thats
what comes of puttin a man like you
in charge of my boat say how long
do you think itd take you to mush up
there 

  a hunderd an fifty miles is a good
ways-goin through the brush like ill
have to do the man said ill do my
best though to make it in ten days

  sixteen hunderd an sixty-five dol-
lars  again murtry groaned an
maybe a whole lot more-if you dont
make it in ten days well what are
you standin there for get a move
on

  wait just a minute mr murtry
ive just thought about somethin that
may save you a whole lot of money
an save me that long trip upriver on
foot an old-timer over on penny ante
crick has been tellin all around that this
young benton sledded in nearly five
gallons of oil last winter he was
laughin about him usin it to grease his
sled runners an hes got upward of
four gallons of it left now if you
could buy it off him-

  why of course murtry inter-
rupted briskly i heard about it a
month ago just forgot it he turned
to benton how much do you want
for that oil he asked in a pleasant
voice

  young benton was thinking fast
he too had forgotten all about the oil
that he had bought to make slippin
easy he had considered the stuff
worthless but now-

  ill tell you mr murtry he said
thoughtfully i had a lot of work
sledding that oil in here last winter

i really hadnt thought about selling it
but since you need it and i dont ill
let you have it

  you mean for nothin murtry
asked incredulously

  of course not i mean for a fair
price

  murtry became suspicious what
do you call a fair price he countered
its worth nothin whatever to you an
ill give you-lets see ill give you
two dollars a gallon for it an allow
you a dollar a pound for freightin it
into the country fair enough aint
it

  benton grinned thats one wav of
looking at it he said amiably but i
really cant think of letting it go for
what you offer two dollars a gallon
is more than the oil is worth but-
the freighting the stuff into this coun-
try man that was the hardest work
i ever did in my life

  i get you murtry spoke thickly
youve got me where the wools short
an you aim to gouge me all right-
tell you what ill do-ill give you a
hundred dollars cash on the nail how
bout it

  that would be gouging as you call
it benton seemed to be considering
the matter no he said at last i
cant take that much money four gal-
lons of oil isnt worth a hundred dol-
lars

  say what in thunder are you driv-
in at murtry cried angrily are
you tryin to kid somebody

  not at all youve made your offer
and now ill make mine benton spoke
slowly and distinctly as you said a
moment ago that oil is really worth
nothing at all to me so ill tell you what
ill do ill just give you the oil pro-
vided that youll give me something
thats worth nothing whatever to you
in case you dont know i mean a sluice
head of water from caribou creek
are you on

  murtry was thinking hard there was
greener than spruce



not one chance in a thousand of this
confident youngster finding gold on that
little dry gulch there was water to
spare lots of it going to waste but oil
-there was only four gallons of lubri-
cating oil in the country with a scowl
murtry nodded his head in the affir-
mative

  it was a month later before the old-
timer visited young benton on his dry
gulch fully a half dozen men were
bustling about on the claim benton
himself was closely watching two men
who were holding the nozzle of a pres-
sure hose trained against a bank of
gravel the old-timer stood aghast un-
til benton came over to greet him

  well how in the name of sam hill
said the old man did you ever make a
deal with joe murtry to get this wa-
ter

  for reply benton fished a bit of paper

from his pocket and passed it over
read it he said with a grin

  the old-timer slowly spelled out the
brief document

  in consideration of four gallons of engine
oil i hereby agree to sell assign and trans-
fer to harris benton a full sluice head of
water to be taken from the waters of cari-
bou creek and i agree to allow hirn or his
agents to go on my claim or claims to dig
the necessary ditch to carry said water

joe murtry

  youre the first man that ever got
the best of joe murtry gasped the old-
timer how in thunder did you do
it

  benton explained

  and now he went on ive got
some good miners working for me but
-youre an old-timer-do they seem to
be working the ground all right

  listen son said the old-timer sol-
emnly you dont need the advice of
an old-timer

hey called him johnnie
crosscut for short-no
doubt because his real
name was john crossut
it may have been because
he was a shake maker
and a past master with a saw at any
rate he had an occupation and a temper
that suited the name crosscut was a
man who insisted on having his own
way he didnt give a whoop for his
old partner or anybody else for days
the two old partners had lived apart
except when there was a tree to fall
just now old crosscut was standing
near the edge of a cliff looking up at
the top of a huge redwood the tree
was a giant of its kind fully a thou-
sand years old standing not more than
twenty feet from the brink of a preci-
pice that did not matter to old john-
nie crosscut splitstuff bill his
partner was standing by his side
splitstuff had just taken his second con-
secutive bite of tobacco and when old
splitstuff did that the wind was headed
toward an argument

  of all the dang nonsense he was
saying they aint a bit o sense in it
only because youre so ornery and stub-
born that ere redwood crosscut is
one of the best shake trees on the claim
but if we falls her into the canon they
aint no earthly way you kin work her
up unlessen you get a balloon

  old johnnie crosscut was sighting
toward the other side of the canon a
gray squirrel had run out on the tree
above them and was announcing his de-
fiance as far as they could see there
was nothing but the everlasting green
of the redwood forest

  yeah he answered mebbe so
but if you had brains like i got split-
stuff and some of my vision youd
know what it was for

  it was not the first argument between
the two old men they had been going
at it for years until they had reached
the point where neither would tell the
other what he had in mind and where
each regarded the other as just a little
bit too old to have full possession of
his faculties they had been partners


western story magazine

so long that the name of splitstuff 
crosscut had become a trade-mark
they made shakes and inasmuch as
they always picked the best trees the
stencil s  c had now become a stand-
ard

  at first they had had the freedom of
the whole redwoods but lately there
had come rumors of sawmills so the
two old men had retired to long
canon there they had purchased two
hundred acres of a spanish grant the
said two hundred acres being the finest
stretch of redwoods in the whole belt-
all level and abutting straight out to
the precipitous sides of long canon
there was one tree in particular the
giant of them all that stood not twenty
ieet from the edge of the cliff from
where it grew the canon was not more
than two hundred feet across although
in depth it was close onto a thousand
feet the claim was shake timber from
beginning to end and shake timber is
the straightest-grained and the cleanest
on earth

  all had gone well until the big lum-
ber people had started looking over the
mountains the first thing that the
timber buyers had spotted was that two-
hundred-acre tract of shake trees it
was the core of the forest they had
to have it they wanted it so bad that
they offered the old men five thousand
dollars for their rights they might
have bought it at that figure too had
they had the foresight to get the two
old men together before making the
offer that would have been putting
the proposition straight up without
showing preference besides five
thousand was more money than either
man had seen in his lifetime they
did make the offer to johnnie cross-
cut and the stubby old fellow had
agreed to accept-providing they could
persuade his partner but old split-
stuff billy could not see it he was
either slighted because he had been the
second to be approached or else he was

just downright stubborn anyway he
refused to sell

  why you decrepit old knothole
he had cried to his partner t alius
did say that you was getting feeble me
sell i should say not alls the mat-
ter with you johnnie is that your brain
is getting soft its our timber aint
it and its mine just as much as its
yourn if them sawmills is a-coming
in here theyll have to have our land
to log this canon and theyll give twenty
thousand just as quick as theyll give
five

  all of which happened to be true be-
cause the man who had made the offer
was a speculator and the worst kind of
a rogue the speculator was planning
to get possession of the land before the
real advance he knew that the big
lumber interests would pay far more
than twenty thousand nevertheless
his coming had been the cause of the
final split of the s  c shake concern

  there had been a bitter row in the
end old johnnie crosscut had picked
up his wedges and saws and saddled his
pony then he had moved to the south
end of the claim where he built his own
cabin and lived by himself hence-
forth each man had worked his own
cuts and split his own shakes they
had only come together when there was
a tree to fall and they would not have
done that but for the fact that it takes
two good men to lay down a giant red-
wood that was what had brought
them together to-day

  just at daylight old johnnie crosscut
had slipped up to splitstuff bills cabin
and poked his head through the door
come on you stubborn old donkey
he had cried i want you to help me
cut a tree and you neednt go asking
me a bunch of fool questions about it
neither

  but when they had come to that giant
redwood near the edge of the precipice
and johnnie had started sighting the
fall straight across the chasm old billy
the bridge across the canyon



had  started to balk that was when he
had taken the second chew

  it will take a balloon to work her
up he exclaimed of all the dang
idiotic freaks now i know youre
crazy

  old johnnie crosscut was grinning
it tickled his fancy to think that he
had the other guessing

  yep he answered sighting the tree
and measuring the big trunk im
crazy splitstuff crazy just like a fox
are you or are you not a-going to help
me cut this tree i cant sell the land
without you sign the paper but i kin
fall any tree thats on my half we
agreed to help fall any tree that the
other wanted didnt we it aint my
fault that your brain is all frizzled up
and has lost its vision so vou cant look

                                         

into the future how about it

  a bargain was a bargain even with
old billy he lit his pipe showing that
he was nervous after that he tight-
ened his belt and sighted the fall over
the canon

  well he said finally the way i
gets it the distance is about two hun-
dred feet across this here tree is
about three hundred feet to the tip
when she falls shell strike on the
other side and snap off like a lead pen-
cil that is unlessen you rides her
down one of them big trees on the other
side

  you could do that of course
only it would bust all the limbs off that
tree over there that tree belongs to
the lumber people and they think each
tree is worth about a million dollars-
when they own it

  yes and i knows that too an-
swered old johnnie crosscut but i
dont aim to murder none of them trees
-not one ill let em act as a spring
to break our fall i dont aim to bust
nothing just the same i happens to
know that there aint two other men in
all californy who can make that kind
of a fall without bustin timber we

can put in the undercut then saw her
and wedge her down what you say

  now every craftsman likes to per-
form the supreme stroke of his calling
and billy was no exception if they
could fall that tree without splintering
it they would have something to crow
about

  well he said stroking his beard
and watching an eagle soar over the
chasm we kin try it but under-
stand i aint a-goin to be responsible
for your fool judgment any man who
would want to give away twenty thou-
sand dollars for five aint got no sense
and-

  at that allusion to the disputed sale
the argument was on again it went
on during the whole of the two days
that they were chopping the undercut
and dragging the crosscut old billy
would lean against the saw handle and
look across at his aged partner he
loved him with all the love of one crony
for another but it was not in his na-
ture to say it johnnie was getting old
he said to himself and needed watch-
ing and dang his old hide if he
wanted to live alone he could do it

  all the while old johnnie was grin-
ning to himself he knew that the
road around the head of long canon
took up twelve long miles and that by
falling this tree he was demonstrating
the best short cut in the mountains
there was a vast difference between
twelve miles and two hundred feet
he was going to sell out and sell out
just as soon as he could dang a pard-
ner like he had anyway

  it took two days to get ready for the
last strokes on the forenoon of the
third they were all ready for the wedg-
ing in fact old johnnie had just
stooped to pick up the sledge when
some one stepped from the tall ferns
that grew close by he recognized the
man as the same fellow who had at-
tempted to buy the claim a short time
back the old man dropped his sledge


western story magazine

in his surprise he did not know how
the cantankerous splitstuff would take
it splitstuff had reached into his hip
pocket but instead of a gun he had
fetched out a plug of tobacco old
johnnie was thankful for that he saw
the speculator turn white step back
and run his hand into his coat pocket
then he had checked himself the tree
was ready to fall but johnnie knew
that being a redwood it would stand
a long while-until it was wedged or
caught by the wind old splitstuff bill
was biting off a chew

  well pardner he was saying to the
speculator you thought i was reach-
ing for something else didnt you
and i dont mind telling you that if
you keep on shovin into somebody
elses business i will reach and just
to help you with your thinking  show
you how t do it he passed his hand
across his hip and a gun barked then
the gun was back again so he
said and ill warn ye that old john-
nie is even a better shot than i am

  the city man blanched he was a
tall man with exceedingly long legs
his body was small for his height and
his face was hawklike what with his
derby hat his hook nose and his black
eyes he was like a spider he had
reached for an automatic and had al-
ready drawn out the butt when he
caught the idea of the demonstration
he laughed wickedly

  well he snapped there are two
of us that can play that game only
i didnt come up here for anything like
that im an honest business man mr
splitstuff-not a murderer i havent
got anything to say to you anyway i
gave you your chance a while back and
you refused it so now i wouldnt let
you in on it if i could but mr cross-
cut here is different you can see with
half an eye that hes got brains hes
got a good head for business i want
to see him down at his cabin

  it tickled old johnnie crosscut to

hear his partner rebuked in fact he
had half expected to see old splitstuff
start shooting also it suited his van-
ity to hear the speculator tell which one
of them had the brains perhaps the
city man had thought of a way of get-
ing around his stubborn old partner a
city man would know all about the
tricks of the law yes he would go
down to the cabin the tree could wait
and so could old splitstuff bill

  the speculator looked up at the tree
for a moment and then started oif in
the direction of crosscuts cabin five
minutes later he was showing the old
man a piece of paper he had produced
it from one of many blanks that he had
in his pocket it was a thirty-day op-
tion on the old mans share of the land
it was an important matter lie said
and if he could get that option he would
be willing to write out a check for two
hundred dollars he did not say that
the deal was almost a certainty and
that the big lumber chief was even at
that minute coming into the mountains
the old man did not understand much
about business he read the paper over
and over

  you mean he asked at length that
if i sign this here paper you will give
me a check for two hundred dollars
flow about my pardner bill 

  the speculator had pushed his hat to
the back of his head his eyes were
growing blacker and his lips were set
-as if he could already see the old man
signing

  i mean just that crosscut he said
all you have to do is to sign the pa-
per ill give you a check for two hun-
dred dollars the paper says that you
agree to sell me your half interest for
two thousand five hundred dollars
it says that i am paying you two hun-
dred down and that if i dont pay the
rest within thirty days why the money
is yours its yours anyway because
when i pay the balance it goes as part
of the purchase price savvy  its
the bridge across the canyon



yours just as soon as it reaches your
hands here you are i got a check
all made out but first you better sign
the paper i want to be fair and thats
why im paying that two hundred al-
ways be fair is my motto honesty
you know now wait a minute here
-hello whats that

  old crosscuts pony was at the feed
rack just at that moment she had
taken a notion to nicker the specu-
lator seemed to have a sudden interest
in horseflesh

  dog-gone mr crosscut he ex-
claimed did you notice that horse
she can almost talk cant she never
seen anything like it for a voice she
seemed to just say i want some hav 
the words and the nicker apparently-
reminded the old man that he had not
given his pet her customary bite he
turned around and trotted her out an
armful of hay that done he came
back to sign the paper

  yep said the old man i clean
forgot her i alius gives her a nip
every time i comes in and she knows
it aint another pony like her for hav-
ing sense knows every word i says
yessir and when i whistles she
comes to me just like a dog split-
stuff bill my old pardner never kept a
horse but i alius did

  the old man had taken everything in
good faith he did not know that the
stranger had purposely diverted his at-
tention so that he could switch papers
neither did he know that the fellow
was a rogue and a master of his kind
the man said something about ink and
johnnie started to find some his hol-
ster got caught while he squirmed
around so he took out his gun and
placed it on the table he found the ink
and the pen in a far corner of the
drawer the man placed the paper in
front of him it was the option just
as he had read the old man signed
and the moment that he had done so
he learned something the speculator

had pulled a second sheet from under
the first and had left old johnnie hold-
ing an unsigned option the man
straightened up his evil eyes were
snapping like devils

  thanks old man he laughed
this is about the easiest trick that i
ever turned in my life an option ha
ha and me give you two hundred
dollars yeah well old boy ill tell
you what youve done youve just
signed me over all your interest in this
here shake claim the option was
what you was looking at but what you
was signing is just the same as a deed

  he should have known better but
he was the kind of a man who had to
gloat over an evil act the gun was
in the center of the table and he had
no idea that the old man would reach
for it as it was the rogue only beat
him by an inch old john turned and
the speculator shot from the pocket of
his coat johnnie crosscut reeled
around and then fell-shot through the
lungs it had all happened in a sec-
ond and was not at all in the rogues
calculations for a moment the fellow
stood still wondering just what had
happened then he stooped over to the
old mans form

  dead he said dead well i
got the deed anyway they aint
a-going to prove that i killed him
what i wants now is to get out of here
and get out of here quick ill just take
his horse and ride up around long
canon and come out on the other side
then i can hit straight for frisco

  two minutes later he was on cross-
cuts horse riding up the road- and
he had hardly got out of sight when
the lean form of old billy splitstuff
came hobbling down the path that led
to the cabin the keen ears of the old
woodsman had heard that muffled shot
of the automatic had it been an old-
fashioned  he would not have
moved but an automatic that
meant that the stranger had done the


western story magazine

shooting old bill came straight down
through the trees he saw that the
pony was gone that the door of the
cabin was open and he saw a man in-
side stretched out on the floor with
one leap old splitstuff had his partner
in his arms

  johnnie johnnie  he cried
crosscut old pal you aint dead
tell me to himself he muttered
no he aint dead yet shot-shot-
let me see-yep here she is thank
god shes high its his lung but
lots of men have lived through that
if i can only get him out and to a doc-
tor 

  but his horse is gone i suppose
that crook stole the horse and is riding
up the canon i got to have that horse
that crook will come down the other
side i got to get over and beat him to
it i got to take johnnie

  suddenly he straightened up and ran
to the door he looked out and up
at the sky the cool air of the forest
seemed to tell him what to do he was
thinking about that tree all she
needed was wedging-perhaps a few
strokes of the saw but could he get
her down alone

  he knew that he could not climb the
steep gorge of the canon in half a day
if he could drop that tree he would
make it in an hour that is-if he
could do it but first he would have
to take care of old johnnie the old
fellow had fallen with his head against
the corner of the stove he was un-
conscious

  in five minutes splitstuff had him
bathed and bandaged then he took
him in his arms and started back to the
great redwood old johnnie might
have had some wild notion in his head
when he started falling that tree but
it was hardly anything like this

  the first thing was to place his part-
ners body on a bed of soft ferns
then he picked up some wedges and
began sighting in a case like this the

first wedge was very important he
would have to hit the limbs of the tree
on the opposite bank before it had
been a matter of pride now it was a
necessity the tree would have to go
just right or it would snap off

  he started the first wedge-and
then another soon he realized that he
would have to saw sawing alone in
a case like that was a terrible job-al-
most impossible but old splitstuff was
sawing for a life he went back to
the wedge and when he drove it in this
time he got a pop like a rifle shot the
old tree was sending out its warning
another pop and another

  there followed a half hour of back-
breaking work three quarters of an
hour if he did not get it down pretty
soon the villain would come down from
the head of the canon and escape old
splitstuff could not keep his mind off
that horse the tree popped and
groaned its death agony but a red-
wood giant is hard to tip the old man
put in more wedges

  the time came when every stroke of
the sledge sent a quiver to the top of
the great monarch whang whang
whang he was perspiring profusely
and he was getting weak time was get-
ting precious then-right before his
eyes the wedge was getting loose the
saw cut had widened he drove the
wedge in with a mighty stroke after
that he stepped calmly back and waited

  a redwood does not go down with a
bang it starts with a slow hesitation
the top was just moving for all the
world as if the tree was taking its last
breath over-easy-easy down-down
first with a soft swish after that with
the speed of a bullet boom  crash
on the other side of the chasm there
was a shower of limbs stripping from
the trees a crash and a grinding of
splintered fragments then there was
a sudden lurch as the tree stopped still
old johnnie had guessed right the
limbs and the tangle of brush on the
the bridge across the canyon



other side had broken the fall the
tree was across the canon

  now splitstuff had another job the
tree was fully twenty feet through he
had to climb up the butt with old john-
nie on his shoulder by using a part
of the staging for a ladder he made
it he was up on the soft red bark
on his back was his partner and be-
low him was a dizzy fall of a thousand
feet his feet sank between the great
seams of red fiber he was conscious
of but one thing-and one thing only
he kept repeating over and over

  i got to get that horse i was a
jackass to act like i did i was a jack-
ass  poor old johnnie they aint
a-going to take him from me he
aint a-going to die i got to get that
horse

  and on his shoulder at that moment
old johnnie crosscut was coming to
he had just opened his eyes at first
it was all strange to him-like a night-
mare he could not understand where
he was then like a flood it all came
back-the land shark the switching of
the paper and the shot for a minute
he was puzzled he was over a canon
and he was on a tree some one was
carrying him he heard a voice

  i was a jackass to act like i did
said the voice poor old johnnie
they aint a-going to take him from
me

  that voice was splitstuff billys
how johnnie loved him it was worth
being shot just to hear the words the
durn old rascal thought johnnie to
himself well mebbe they was two
of them jackasses

  that was all he remembered their
coming among the great limbs and that
terrible gulf below them after that
blackness fell again

  when splitstuff billy reached the
other side and climbed out of the tree-
top johnnie was unconscious old
billy carried him three hundred feet
farther until he came to the road that

led down from the head of the canon
it was well sheltered and hidden in the
dense forest fie had hjvplan

  first he made his partner a bed by
the roadside and looked after his
wounds johnnie seemed to be breath-
ing easily then he straightened and
started up the road on a run there
was a chaparral hillside a little way off
and a clump of madrones above the
road he was going to play highway-
man the land shark ought to be along
any minute he chose a spot above a
cut in the road when the time came
he would land suddenly and take the
crook by surprise he felt of his 
there was a noise coming a short way
off fie planned to step on a fallen
madrone log flip out kis gun and wing
his man next minute the rider came
into view splitstuff waited he
stepped on the log

  but something happened a madrone
is about the slipperiest thing in the
woods the morning dew was still in
the forest and the bark was wet old
splitstuff had hardly placed his weight
on the fallen tree when his foot skidded
and he fell backward his head struck
the log and he was knocked uncon-
scious his body started rolling down
the steep bank a boulder was unlodged
and came after him plump his body
landed in the road it was followed by
a shower of gravel and boulders one
of the heavy rocks struck the old mans
body rolled over and passed beyond the
road the horseman had drawn up
the speculator knew in an instant what
had happened that splitstuff had been
hoping to waylay him he was wish-
ing that the old man was dead but he
wanted to be sure

  going to pick me off eh he mut-
tered just a-going to waylay me and
shoot me like a dog going to murder
me in cold blood eh well theres
two of us in this game now i might
just as well pass sentence right now
seeing as how he was going to kill me


western story magazine

ill just get off and see that a good
job is done i could use a gun but that
might look suspicious so ill get down
there and crush his head with a rock
that will make it look like he got killed
in the slide the low-down cur he
wanted to murder me eh

  he slid out of the saddle and started
to pick up a rock just having found
one to his liking he was startled by a
whistle from the road ahead of him
the whistle was faint but the mare
had pricked up her ears she shied to
the opposite side of the road and started
forward the man dropped the rock
a feeling of terror ran up his spine

  whoa he shouted at the horse
whoa you brute whoa i

  another whistle sounded this time a
stronger one the mare had started to
nicker and was running away with a
curse the long-legged villain started
running to head her off

  whoa he yelled whoa

  that only seemed to frighten the
horse she gathered speed and broke
into a gallop the man had his gun in
his hand he was ready for any emer-
gency but this time his opponent had
the advantage of a fair draw the land
shark suddenfy stopped in horror his
blood froze for there sitting by the
roadside was the man whom he had
killed old johnnie crosscut had
whistled to his horse and the horse had
come the old man was holding a
wicked  the speculator whipped his
automatic and let fire but he was too
late the  belched and the villains
hand dropped at the wrist with a yell
of terror the tall rogue started to run
but another shot stopped him he heard
the voice of johnnie crosscut

  no you dont dang you the old
mans voice was feeble and it was com-
ing hard but it was steadied by nerve
and excitement no you dont i
seen what you was a-going to do you
was a-going to crush splitstuff billys
head with a rock wasnt you kinda

nice and merciful aint you and i
suppose you wonder how i got here
eh well ill tell you that right now
old billy carried me over on that tree
he must have found me where you shot
me and he must have put my gun back
in my holster lucky thing he did
then he put down that tree and carried
me across he must have laid me down
in the road a ways back there and then
went up to wait for you

  i was unconscious when he put me
down but it seems that i come to in
time i was afraid something would
happen so i dragged myself to this here
tree i had the gun and i wanted to
help billy out if i could only he was
too far away thats why i whistled
didnt i tell you that that there pony
would come any time i whistled yep
so now you got a sore wrist and im
the boss and seeing as how ive got
the gun and old billys out of commis-
sion i guess ill just have to hold to-
gether until we kin get out ill warn
ye though that if i feel myself a-slip-
ping im just a-going to plug you and
let you lay now then you kin ketch
that horse billy and me has got to
ride somehow and you kin walk by
the way you better hand over that there
little paper oh now -ou neednt get
sore you dont want to feel bad just
because you got beat by a couple of old
shake makers like me and billy leave
that part of it until you get down to
the sheriff yep wait a minute
here comes some one up the road
mebbe they will give you a hand

  a horseman had appeared in the
majestic aisle of redwoods then another
and another before they knew it the
shake man and the crook were the center
of an interested group of listeners old
johnnie was almost ready to pass into
unconsciousness again but he managed
to gurgle out his story pointing to his
wound and the slip of paper as evi-
dence-also to the crumpled form of old
splitstuff billy one of the newcomers
the bridge across the canyon



dismounted and took the old mans
hand another stepped up to the crook
johnnie saw the man slip a cord from
his pocket and start binding the land
shark up evidently the man was an
officer the man who was holding john-
nies hand was speaking

  well i guess we got here just in
time crosscut im the head of the
new lumber company my name is
tompkins and i was just coming up
here to take a look at your claim our
cruisers turned in their report over a
week ago evidently this man knew
what they had said and was scheming
to get in ahead of us and hold us up
i dont mind telling you that we are
mightily interested and if what you
say about this tree is true your claim is
doubly valuable im going over now
and see the thing for myself then
to one of his companions he said take
care of the old men and see that they
are comfortable better take them down
to the companys hospital ill be back
in a few minutes

  when he came back both billy and
old johnnie had been loaded on the
horses and were on their way to town
but the lumber man spoke to his com-
panion

  that really was a wonderful piece of
timber falling its a natural bridge
the best part of it is that theres a
tree on this side that we can fall along-
side of the other and complete the job
it will save twelve long miles of hauling
when we get the other tree down we can
dig under them along the bank and let
them down to the level those timbers

will last forever and really i believe
that shake claim is the best that ive
ever seen its worth a fortune in itself
and that bridge makes it worth just that
much more again likewise i would
dike to engage both of those old men to
take charge of our timber falling men
who can handle trees like that are as
scarce as frogs hair but im almighty
glad that they caught that crook that
fellow has cost us a pile of money
now liell go where he belongs

  two days later the two old men were
sitting in adjoining beds in the hospital
there was a kind look in their eyes as
they talked splitstuff billy said
honest now johnnie why did you
cut that durn tree anyway

  the other smoothed out his whiskers
and smiled so far he had held it a
secret

  why did i fall it he answered
why you durn ole rascal why do you
suppose i didnt have a reason on
earth except to get your goat i was
just contrary thats all i figgered that
youd go right up in the air and that
id just make you help me do it any-
way

  there was silence for a minute and
then old splitstuff billy said

  well that might have been it but i
dont know it was kind of ducky
here tompkins has paid us ten thou-
sand dollars for our bridge and twenty
thousand for our claim say johnnie
i just been a-thinking we been a
couple of durn ole fools aint we
we sure have said johnnie cross-
cut
trinidad erie wilson

he second oldest town in
colorado is trinidad
the early explorers of the
region were spaniards
and the name of this
pioneer settlement which
means the trinity is a heritage from
these adventurers the first white man
to settle upon the site of this western
city was john hatcher who took up
land for a farm there in  this
hardy pioneer constructed an irrigating
ditch and raised a crop but the hostile
redskins not only destroyed his grain
hut succeeded in driving him away from
the valley

  other settlers gradually came to the
section however and in  trinidad
was a plaza of widely scattered adobe
huts in order to reach the place
travelers were forced to cross a bound-
less region of hills and plains during
the early days of western history
trinidad was a stopping point for
freighters with mule and ox teams who

author of topeka etc

followed the devious windings of the
old santa fe trail on the long over-
land journey to the new mexico city
in  cabins were built in and around
the crude little frontier hamlet and set-
tlers began to grow crops of hay grain
vegetables and fruit

  trinidad was incorporated as a city
in  the same year that colorado
became a state three years later the
first telegraph and railroad entered the
town electric street lights were in-
troduced in  and nine years later
a five-story building was erected in
 a street railway appeared and
from that time on the one-time crude
border settlement has grown steadily
to-day it is a thriving modern city with
a population of fifteen thousand rank-
ing as the fourth city in size in colo-
rado it is situated in the extreme
southeastern part of the state occupy-
ing a hilly site upon both banks of the
purgatory river the sangre de
cristo range of the continental divide
pioneer towns of the west



is about forty miles distant and pueblo
lies one hundred miles to the north

  much of the prosperity of trinidad
is due to the coal-mining industry
adjacent to the city a coal field occupies
a long narrow basin of about two thou-
sand square miles along the foot of the
rocky mountains this region con-
tains the largest deposits of bituminous
coal west of the missouri river
various mines in the section employ
about five thousand men with a monthly
pay roll of more than five hundred thou-
sand dollars stock raising is a thriv-
ing industry in the vicinity and many
excellent ranches are located in las
animas county of which trinidad is
the county seat agriculture is also ex-
tensively carried on in the land north-
east of this colorado city where sev-
eral irrigation canals supply water to
alfalfa fields and crops of various kinds

  trinidad enjoys a splendid reputation
as a place of residence elevated quite
some feet above sea level the cli-
mate is ideal the summers being bright
and cool and the autumns sunny and
dry this colorado city has well-paved
streets attractive homes successful
mercantile establishments and churches
of almost every denomination good
hotels a large opera house modern
theaters and a number of parks and
playgrounds all contribute toward mak-
ing trinidad a pleasant place to live
an equestrian statue of kit carson the
famous frontiersman was erected after
his death and stands in the park
bearing the name of this great west-
erner the public schools here rank
with the best in the country and there
is a well-equipped carnegie library a
fine country club provides one of the
best golf links in colorado and the city
maintains a convenient camping ground
for motor tourists

  some of the most beautiful scenery
in the west surrounds trinidad which
is in the heart of a picturesque canon
and mountain district overlooking the

city at the south stands fishers peak
named after a german artillery officer
who commanded a battery in the army
of the west that camped at its base in
 this wonderful mountain rises
to a height of over ten thousand feet
and is one of themost noted peaks in
the west to the north of the city is a
huge rock known as simpsons rest
there is a story connected with this
picturesque pile which dates back to
the days when trinidad was a frontier
settlement then it was that a pioneer
george simpson by name was attacked
by hostile redskins with his family
he took refuge on this high rock estab-
lishing a miniature fortress upon it
here he successfully withstood the sav-
age onslaught of the indians later he
expressed a wish that this fortress
should be his last resting place and
here he sleeps in a grave cut in the vir-
gin rock upon the summit of simp-
sons rest the city has erected a huge
electrically illuminated sign with the
word trinidad in eight-foot letters

  thirty miles away from trinidad
over a splendid highway lies the beauti-
ful stonewall gap and park the
famous stonewall is a huge stratum of
rock turned up edgeways rising some
two hundred feet in the air with a thick-
ness of about twenty-five feet through
this peculiar formation which stretches
for miles and miles is the stonewall
pass around which is a forty-acre
park maintained as a free camping
ground for tourists another fine scenic
drive out of trinidad is to the raton
pass a distance of twenty-five miles
away over a hard-surfaced road and
easily accessible from trinidad is the
san isabel national forest which of-
fers unlimited sport to the fisherman
hunter and camper

  trinidad is located on the national
old trail santa fe trail colorado-to-
gulf and the plains-mountains high-
ways it is served by four railroads
trinidad is said to be one of the best-

the sands of time

tn about one hundred and fifty years alamogordo new mexico will be entirely
covered by sand near this famous frontier town which has been a great
center for famous cattlemen outlaws pioneers and celebrated southwest charac-
ters are located the great white sands these consist of pure white crystallized
gypsum blown from an ancient lake bottom covering an area of two hundred and
seventy square miles

    the white sands are moving toward alamogordo at the rate of one mile
every twenty years old stage roads and cow trails of the eighties and nineties
are now covered fifty feet with white sand this mobile earth surface is formed
and kept moving by winds that blow always in one direction and this means
that the small city must within a century and a half disappear or change its
location nothing man can do will retard this earth creep as the dunes are fifty
and seventy-five feet high and the force with which the sand moves is almost
inconceivable

   navajos protest payment for bridge building

a vigorous protest was filed recently with the senate appropriations com-
mittee by the new mexico association on indian affairs against the use of
 of navajo indian tribal funds to defray half the cost of building a
bridge across the colorado river at lees ferry arizona and one across the
san juan river at bloomfield new mexico both being partly off the reservation
it had been planned to use  of navajo tribal funds derived from oil
royalties as part payment for the construction of these bridges the document
of protest however states that the navajo tribal council made specific objection
to such use of their money and that the indian bureau pledged its faith to
have the income spent for agricultural and industrial purposes irrigation ad
roads and bridges within the reservation and for the direct benefit of the
navajos they did not want their money spent on state or federal highways
it is declared that the proposed bridges are for the benefit of the general
public and that they will be of little or no use to the indians

hn little did not pull
n the lines when he
the command and
hances are that old
would have stopped
anyway for fifteen years he had
dragged the express wagon down to the
station before train time waited for
several minutes until the train arrived
and departed then hauled the usual load
of trunks and suit cases to the various
parts of town from time to time op-
position came in in the form of auto
trucks but for once gasoline and speed
did not triumph over horseflesh old
john and old bill had never lost a
piece of baggage yet and a few minutes
one way or another counted for little
when measured against reliability

  back up

  old bill did more than back he
swung slightly to the left cramped the
wheels at the proper angle then backed
and stopped john little wrapped the
lines around the whip he never used
and climbed stiffly down

  as the train came to a stop he sang
out in a voice somewhat weakened by
time baggage transferred baggage
baggage howdy mr stanton yep
ill get em right out hello joe howd
you find things in the city yep ill
get them trunks out right away bag-
gage transferred baggage

  when the last arrival had left the
platform john little found himself sur-
rounded by suit cases while his right
hand held a number of baggage checks
he did not consult the station agent
who also had charge of the baggage
room he merely removed such trunks
and bags from the room as he needed
and handed the checks to the official
many of the bags and trunks he recog-
nized without a glance at the names
or initials

  old john followed the same routine
to-day though it was evident his mind
was not on his work from time to
time he would glance at a beautifully il-
lustrated folder that spoke in glowing
terms of bathing and fishing happy
people mostly beautiful girls were de-

picted emerging or entering the cool
surf some were splashing around
while others were reclining on the sand
drenched with sun the only fish
probably in the vicinity was attached to
the end of a line which bent a pole at
just the proper angle to simulate reality
to prove that it was a fish on the end
of the line and not a snag the fish was
visible in the distance a sailboat could
be seen heeling over in the brisk breeze

  old john knew the folder by heart
yes sir he explained to his various
friends along the way itll be my first
vacation in fifteen years i was going
to take a vacation fifteen years ago
then my horse up and died on me and
it took all my money to buy old bill
here since then ive salted away some
not much but some and ive been too
busy to find time me and bill have
been on the job right steady

  some one asked how long will you
be away john

  im taking a real one im going to
be gone three months i figure a man
should have a little fun as he goes
along and not wait until hes too old
to play im going to have some of my
fun now while im gone young eddy
hillman will look after the business
hes home from college and can use the
money besides rasslin trunks will put
him in good shane to plav football next
fall

  there was another question the
townspeople naturally asked what
are you going to do with old bill

  old john and old bill were always
together therefore what was bill to do
during the period of relaxation

  well you see bill is only a horse
and a horse gets his fun as he goes
along in life each night rest a rest on
sunday and his feed right along it
aint like a man who needs a change of
scenery once in a while danny sex-
ton has some cultivating hauling and
the like of that to do this summer and
i figure old bill can earn his keep that

way next fall well be back at the
same old place doing business

  it is pretty well settled that animals
possess a certain process by which their
actions are governed there are those
who claim animals reason and think
there are others who deny this and in-
sist that every act of an animal is in-
stinctive

  old bili was not particularly con-
cerned over this problem of mankind
he only knew that the cool winds of
an evening brought with them the scent
of pine trees falling water and moun-
tain meadows for fifteen years he had
turned his eyes toward the mountains
some twenty miles away and speculated
on what might be there but the op-
portunity to investigate never came
his life it would seem was to be spent
on the pavements where a horses feet
all but burned from contact with the
hot black asphalt flis nostrils were
continually outraged with the heavy
scent of gasoline and burning oil ex-
cept on the hottest days the pavements
were hard to his hoofs each hoof-
beat was a mild shock occasionally
his duties took him down a dirt street
and when the earth was soft and springy
from a recent rain trotting was pleas-
ant but for the most part he knew
only the hot pavements

  each day it was the same old john
would appear about sunrise and rest his
arms for several moments on the top
rail of the corral then he would whistle
old bill would lift his head thrust his
ears forward by way of greeting then
break into a half trot half gallop until
he crossed the intervening distance-
whereupon he would sniff for the lump
of sugar old john so often brought
this daily act over with the horse was
cared for later hitched up and driven
slowly to the stand

  yes not only each day was it the
same but for fifteen years it had been
the same then without warning
old bill rebels



there came a change old bill respond-
ed to johns whistle and accepted a
lump of sugar but the man did nothing
this morning except to toss an armful
of hay into the manger it was good
hay but at times old bill found it some-
what dusty he longed for crisp dewy
grass occasionally he got it some
passing boy or girl would pull a clump
of grass and feed him or he would
nibble a stray blade or two when his
duties took him beyond the pavements

  for several moments old john con-
templated his faithful horse bills left
hip sagged badly due mostly to the way
he was standing his head dropped a
bit too john noticed

  bill youre getting old he said and
seemed surprised at the discovery
some of these days youll be dropping
off and some of these days theyll be
sending flowers to my funeral well
slong bill see you in the fall

  old john boarded the train and set-
tled back  - his seat still thinking of
bill yes sir sure as youre a foot
high that nag is getting old yes now
that i think of it he laid right down
on me one day-went to sleep hitched to
the wagon

  john was interested in the scenery for
several hours then he dozed a bit after
which he found the diner and ordered a
fine meal this was a vacation and no
expense was to be spared life was
short at best he reasoned and a year
hence he might not be alive to enjoy
a vacation

  when the train stopped at the beach
he gathered up his bags and stepped out
a number of taxicab drivers and bag-
gage men nearly mobbed him

  that aint the way i get business
he grumbled attacking people with my
bare hands

  he looked about for a horse-drawn
vehicle to carry his bags to the hotel
there was none so he submitted to the
sales talk of a taxi driver who had pur-
sued him knowing that eventually he

must weaken and fall john settled
back and experienced a mild thrill he
tipped the driver and registered later
he bought a newspaper and retired
reading in bed with a light directly
above his head

  pretty fine he muttered prettv
fine

  the following day he was up before
sunrise the beach was practically de-
serted except for an occasional bather
he walked worked up an appetite
later donned a bathing suit and spent
the day swimming and dozing on the
sand for hours at a time for the first
time he realized just how tired he was

  fifteen years steady work makes it
hard for a man to let down he mused
lazily this is sure going to make a
new man out of me yesterday i fig-
ured old bill and i would drop off
about the same time but now ill wear
out a couple more horses i wonder if
maybe i hadnt better swap bill for a
younger horse when i get back he
sure looked about all in that last day-
good old bill this was followed a
half hour later by good old bill

  back in the corral old bill was realiz-
ing that something was wrong a day
had passed in idleness and another day
had dawned without the appearance of
old john the sun began to climb and
about eight oclock danny sexton ap-
peared he fed and watered bill then
disappeared xan hour later he re-
turned climbed on bills back and rode
him into the country for nearly a mile
here he stopped at an old barn har-
nessed the horse and attached him to a
light cultivator

  all day long bill worked and it was
harder work than he had ever done be-
fore because it was steadier in the
express business a horse indulged in rest
periods between trains but there was
no rest in ranching dust came from
the ground under him dust was shaken
from the trees on either side when his
shoulders touched leaves and branches

he frequently cleared his nostrils by
violent snorts

  that night he was glad to lie down
in his corral it had been a tough day
no rest no sugar when it was dark a
breeze stole down from the mountains
it carried the scent of pines of green
grass and falling water bill sniffed
longingly somehow he sensed that
neither the pavements nor the orchards
was the place for a tired horse rather
it was up there in those moon-washed
mountains so near so silent and-so
inviting

  danny sexton arrived earlier the fol-
lowing morning he had as he ex-
pressed it a big day ahead he was
somewhat impatient with old bill

  come along he ordered speed up
a bit this is an age of speed

  and when bill a tide of rebellion ris-
ing within him for the first time in
fifteen years balked danny jerked
twice on the halter rope the third time
he yanked with all of his weight

  come on dang yuh

  at the same moment old bill tossed
his head in defiance the halter gave
and danny spilled backwards in the
dust almost instantly he was upon his
feet

  why darn yuh he exclaimed at-
tempting to haze bill into a corner bill
let drive with a pair of clean heels
snorted and galloped toward the open
gate when danny pursued bill speed-
ed up

  well can you beat that its the
first time in years hes showed any life
why if id expected anything like that
i would have handled him different

  for an hour danny pursued then he
gave it up old bill had cut through
several orchards followed a road and
was now inthe open an area of sage
stretched before him and he followed it
for miles here and there he found a
blade of grass but no dust and no hot
pavements seven miles from town he
crossed a stream it was very clear and

cool running over a gravel bottom old
bill drank leisurely as a man of leisure
might sip wine from time to time he
looked about as if expecting pursuit
but danny sexton did not show up

  bill found shade when it grew hot
at sundown he turned his nostrils
toward the breeze laden with the
scent of pine crisp grass and falling
water he did not hurry but plodded
steadily through the moonlit night
presently he began to climb at first
the grade was gradual then it became
steeper he followed a draw for a
while then worked along a hogback
first he encountered small timber then
larger until at last he topped a ridge
and looked below him in front of him
and all around him ahead he could
see the falls the way the moon struck
the water seemed to splash silver about
the stream eddied a moment in a basin
before cutting through the center of the
valley and working to the lower levels
where it formed the river from which
bill had drunk earlier in the day bill
nibbled a bit at the grass then tired
from the climb relaxed

  dawn brought the old horse much
that was new to him and nearly every-
thing that he desired he drank from
the cold stream ate the crisp grass wet
with dew and listened to the bird chorus
that seemed to rise with the sun dur-
ing the morning he explored a bit dis-
covered a doe and fawn and later
climbed a ridge from which he looked
down upon a laboring world the
valley below was flat and sweltering be-
neath the blaze of the midday sun the
orchards appeared to be tiny green
squares old bill knew that horses
were laboring among them breathing
dust and dirt bill kicked up his heels
a bit then trotted back to the valley
for hours at a time he contented him-
self with standing in some shady spot
while the cold mountain stream gurgled
about his hoofs for many years these
same hoofs had trod hot pavements
old bill rebels

bill did not know why but the gravel
and water felt good to his hoofs

  weeks followed and no one came to
the valley then one day a man passed
and seeing the horse stopped and tried
to catch him bill was not to be caught
he galloped away with tail up mane
flying and nostrils snorting defiance
several days later two boys tried to
catch him with even less success bill
was living and decided it was worth
while he did not propose to be caught
and have to spend the summer work-
ing

  yet as the days slipped by bill missed
something he did not know just what
it was it seemed indefinite yet it was
always there particularly in the morn-
ing his life now that the excitement
of his new situation had worn off did
not seem complete often he stood si-
lently as if listening or thinking per-
haps he was certainly man has no way
of definitely determining perhaps he
was only waiting for some one he knew
must eventually come the young
birds living in the trees around the
meadow became grown birds the fawn
became a spike buck and old bill be-
came young bill in actions he
stampeded in mock fright on the slight-
est occasion and once or twice he
bucked an imaginary rider from his
back but always this was followed by
a period of reflection

  old john little with the spring of
youth in his step swung aboard the
train his vacation was over he was
mighty glad he was going home

  i sort of wished id brought old bill
along he muttered ill be glad to
see the old cuss a man cant be around
a horse every day for fifteen years
straight and not miss him i suppose a
horse might miss a man too i hope
they didnt work him too hard this sum-
mer he was prettv much all in when i
left

  as the train neared home old johns

conscience prodded him slightly the
right thing would have been to pasture
bill somewhere for the summer but he
had not thought of that until now

  eddie hillman was at the train to
take his bags hello john he said

  others crowded about with greetings
they thumped him on the back and said
he was looking great pie had not
acquired a coat of tan for fifteen years
in the sun delivering baggage had
tanned him to an extent which no beach
resort could hope to improve

  wheres bill eddie

  eddie grinned bills gone john
  gone

  yep acted something scandalous
the day after you left tried to kick the
daylights out of things and disappeared
danny couldnt catch him i guess old
bill figured he was due for a vacation
too aint been seen around since

  i guess he figured right i should
have given him a vacation well dont
any one know where he is

  eddie pointed to a notch in the moun-
tains theres a meadow up there if
youll remember i saw bill while i
was up there fishing tried to catch
him but he was wild and had to give
it up

  it was night before old john reached
the mountains he camped in a cabin
until dawn then covered the last mile
to the meadow it was sunrise when
he stopped and shed the saddle he was
carrying a small windfall blocked his
path so he rested his arms on the trunk
and looked across the meadow there
was bill eating contentedly john whis-
tled sharply

  hey bill he called

  bill lifted his head with a jerk hesi-
tated a moment then galloped across
the field this was the thing he had
missed the morning whistle and what
came with it john climbed the wind-
fall and dropped down on the other side
then he extended a handful of lump
sugar


western story magazine

  im not the same man bill and
youre not the same horse youre
looking great

  old john glanced about the meadow
talk about horse sense im danged if
you didnt use more of it than i did
when it come to picking a place for a

vacation next summer were coming
up here together a couple of people
that work together ought to play to-
gether and youre just like a person
bill

  all of which bill confirmed with an
enthusiastic nod of his head

bear tail makes big medicine

nthe most imposing figure in the crow indian tribe is unquestionably bear

    tail the lone surviving medicine man of the crow people living on the
crow reservation in montana he is held in great reverence by his fellow
redskins especially by the older indians of the pryor district bear tails
prestige in this quarter arises from an incident that occurred five years ago
when the indians of pryor agency were planning an all-indian rodeo there
were two factions interested in the rodeo and of course one of these factions
wanted to dominate the other and control the events the faction to which
bear tail belonged was the weaker and failed to get the better of the various
arguments that arose after the manner of other races when disgruntled the
worsted faction decided to ruin the rodeo rather than have it conducted in
accordance with the ideas of their adversaries

    they therefore went into conclave with their medicine man bear tail
although everything seemed ready on the morning of the day set for the big
show bear tail came forward and warned the camp that there would be no
rodeo the younger members of the tribe jeered at him and ridiculed his
prophecy

    when it came near noon and the active preparations for the rodeo became
manifest bear tail went to his tepee painted his face with weird designs in
brilliant colors and covered his body with white clay he then bade his squaw
cover with mud the entire body of his pony with the exception of its eyes
nose mouth and ears he also warned her to make the tepee fast as a great
storm was coming

    his next move was to mount his pony and ride through the camp carrying
his medicine staff and a willow whistle he blew the whistle and chanted
incantations accompanied by pleading gestures toward heaven it is stated on
good authority that when bear tail left his tepee the sun was high in the
heavens and that the sky was cloudless everything seemed favorable for the
rodeo within a quarter of an hour of the time the medicine-making on the
part of bear tail was inaugurated however gusts of wind were tearing at the
tepees and in another five minutes a gale was blowing it blew harder and
harder until every tepee finally went down and the rain was falling in drenching
sheets the rodeo did not take place and as a result bear tail acquired great
prestige as one having unusual influence with the gods who make wind and rain
and thunder and control the destinies of rodeos

silent chick
the bear creek
 roped a runty
an mustang stal-
ed began to make
law over into a
cow horse the other ranchers of the
isolated district shrugged and shook
their heads sorrowfully

  why said joe myers of the three
bar that pair o hard uns is just bound
to kill one another thats all silent
hes as heartless as a stone wall-glum
sour an mean-an that runt stallion
has a bad eye his self to my way o
think in

  yep said floyd penny regretfully
theyre a good match but im bank-
in on the stallion i mentioned to
silent yesterday that he oughter look

out fer that blue roan but silent only
grunts sayin hell break him all right
enough im thinkin the stallion may
break silents haid fust

  while silent breen was not particu-
larly popular in the district because of
his taciturn demeanor he was never-
theless an old-timer and a good cattle-
man therefore he had the districts
respect if not love his neighbors
looking askance at the blue roan stal-
lion had warned silent in just the same
impersonal spontaneous way in which
they might have warned a tenderfoot
of a coiled rattlesnake it was simply
duty in their minds

  as for silent-he said nothing
whenever any one chanced by his ranch
and stopped to say something deroga-
tory about the mustang stallion old

western story magazine

silent merely grunted or else remarked
that the blue rcan ought to make a good
cow horse being smart and quick he
didnt have any doubt but that hed
eventually tame the little devil

  i guess hes about right at that
was the way ralph fairley eventually
summed it up old silent is heartless
enough to kill that pore boss if neces-
sary an when it comes to the devil in
a man and in a beast i guess the two-
legged devilll win out

  it seemed so before many weeks
silent began to ride the runty roan stal-
lion habitually and the mustang ap-
peared to be thoroughly broken the
range wiseacres shook their heads

  guess a mean man can lick a mean
hoss they decided

  but they were premature in their
judgment it appeared some two
weeks later thad salter rode by
silents place and dropped into the
ranch shack finding food burned to a
crisp on a stove in which the fire had
burned itself out that was a bad sign
when he went to the barn he found
two mares in their stalls stamping and
fretting and when he loosed them they
headed madly for the water tank
that was another bad gign thad
looked around put two and two to-
gether and then ran his pinto two miles
to the eddie owens ranch where he
spread a vague alarm

  hey eddie-old silents disap-
peared cried thad pulling his pinto
up in the owens yard reckon it was
yesterday too signs at his place ill
bet a dollar i will that hes done fer
by that roan stallion somewheres on
the range

  then thars just one thing to ho
said eddie making for the corrals
ill git my boys together-an well go
by frank campbells place an rouse
him then well spread out-but say
thad better take a fresh hoss

  it was almost dusk before the hastily
assembled posse of searchers after

hours in the saddle came upon a
huddled form on the open range in a
clearing just south of squaw mountain
in fact they might have missed the spot
altogether had not the eagle eyes of
thad salter espied a saddled horse
there

  on approach the horse threw up its
head and snorted a challenge it was
the runty blue roan mustang and the
searchers knew that they had found
their man in the crumpled heap that
sprawled on the earth near the nervous
horse

  i knowed it said eddie owens
quietly i knowed it would happen
that stallion has done fer him camp-
bell yuhre a good shot im thinkin
yuhd better-

  campbell had already had the same
idea he raised himself in his stirrups
and whipped out his six-gun quick as
greased lightning but the roan stal-
lion was quicker there was a whir
and the stallion running stiff legged
like a jack rabbit ducked for a willow
patch he swerved just as campbells
pistol cracked there was no need for
campbell to tell the others that he had
missed

  with the stallion tearing off through
the timber beyond range now the men
dismounted to examine the body but
they got a surprise the old rancher
was still breathing they pawed him
over quickly taking inventory of his in-
juries

  one busted arm-forearm left
said eddie owens expertly an two
or three ribs cracked at least an bad
cuts an bruises on his haid an -
eddie ripped open silents flannel shirt
-the same on his chest an on his
shoulders

  that stallion throwed him an then
stomped on him exclaimed thad
salter in a hushed voice

  but hes still livin boys said
eddie looking up hes unconscious
an id say he was bad oft thars only
just a cow horse



one thing to do-rope him across the
back o the easiest pony we got here
an lug him into the hospital at ever-
green eh

  yuhre right eddie

  all right ed reckon that sorrel
mare o mine is lected ill ride double

with young geiger an-

  on the way to evergreen where a
small hospital afforded silent his one
chance for life discussion centered on
the runty roan stallion and it was the
consensus that a bunch should be or-
ganized to go out and get the killer

  hes saddled an bridled said
eddie owens an hes crazy wild in
the timber around squaw mountain i
say let him be hell hang hisself sure
as shootin his bridle or the saddle
will catch somewhars on a limb an hell
die a harder death than ef he was shot
-good riddance-an we dont need to
hunt him down either

  while eddie made his prophecy in
good faith it turned out that he was
wrong silent breen had been in the
hospital only a week taciturn and un-
communicative as ever but slowly
pulling out of the shadow of death
when reports began to come in about
the blue stallion and they were terrify-
ing reports too

  i seen him on the mesa about two
miles west o bendemeer bill white
told eddie owens an hes got rid o
the saddle an most all o the bridle
hes loco sure as im a foot high i
seen him rush a bunch o cattle charge
down on a young bull an like to kill
him-kickin an bitin at him then i
rode out and he beat it pronto

  a killer said eddie judiciously
he aint loco  hes just a killer its
in his blood now that he almost done
fer silent some outlaws are like that
-attackin man an beast without fear
or favor-an old silent tried to gentle
that hoss well well have to go git
him thats all well lose cattle ef we
dont

  however nothing was done just then
tt was some two weeks after that that
young geiger who ran a bunch of white
faces on cub creek a tributary to bear
creek came racing into the owens
ranch to report more depredations by
the roan killer geiger was mad as he
could be

  we gotta organize a gang an go
hoss huntin he told eddie excitedly
that blue stallion o silents is raising
the devil on the range i went out to
see my stuff this mawnin an blamed ef
i dont find one o my best yearlin
steers stretched out daid an all kicked
an bit to pieces i thinks it may have
been a duel with a strange bull but
i looks fer sign an sure enough i find
it-its hoss sign small unshod hoof
ef im any judge its the killer the
blue roan stallion that liked to mur-
dered silent

  guess yuhre right said eddie
slowly well have to git busy
lets see to-days friday how about
startin a round-up monday thatll
give us time to get the boys together
better tell em all to lead a change hoss
too

  all right said geiger

  and so it was all arranged along bear
creek the ranchers were notified by
courier that the districts only recent
wild horse round-up would take place
the following monday object-to rid
the range of that runty roan stallion
that almost killed silent breen and that
was actually slaughtering stock while
many riders would have scoffed at the
idea of wasting time to get revenge on
the roan for injuring breen none of
them hesitated when it came to going
after a stock killer it was really
money in their pockets to rid the range
of the killer

  when monday came it saw a deter-
mined group of riders ready for the
hunt every man had an extra horse
some provisions and a bed roll eddie
owens was elected leader by acclama-


western story magazine

tion and then some time was lost reach-
ing a decision as to where the roan stal-
lion might be looked for first some
were for combing the thickets on squaw
mountain others were for sweeping
the bendemeer mesa and still others
were for riding the low meadows along
the creek itself

  while i aint no fortune teller an
able to say whar that roan is said
eddie owens finally im positive he
aint along bear creek thats whar
the ranches are an from all we know
o the brute hes afraid o humans
and i dont think hes in the timber
neither hes rid o his saddle an like
as not he lost that in the timber after
a hard struggle-may have been hung
up a day or two too no id say look
first on the bendemeer mesa thats
my vote boys

  eddies vote carried but at night
after hard riding and running down
everything that looked at a distance
like the stallion the searchers re-
luctantly turned their tired mounts of
the day loose to pick their way home
theyd use the spare horses on the mor-
row and hope to find the roan theyd
be out of rations the second evening
and that meant the hunt would have to
be called off for the time being the
roan seemed to have vanished off the
face of the earth he was not on the
mesa and he was not in the rich
meadows along the tumbling bear
creek

  waal said eddie at the start of
the second days ride well make
squaw mountain campbell you strike
fer the south slope an work to the
west the boys with me will work the
north slope an go east that way well
cover her ef you sight im-fire a
volley as signal an well do the same
an look fer tracks-that might lead us
right

  but the hunt ended the second day
without a glimpse of the roan the
cowmen went home discouraged

  for a full month nothing was heard
of the roan the ranchers began to be-
lieve that he had at last hung himself
by the remnants of his bridle in the
timber or else that he had left the
range

  meanwhile in the evergreen hos-
pital old silent breen had won his fight
for life and was rapidly convalescing
but he was as reticent as ever and out-
side of being evidently grateful for any
attention on the part of doctors or
nurses had nothing to say a few of
the ranchers from the bear creek dis-
trict visited him but they were received
so coolly that they went away quickly
without mentioning the roan stallion at
all they were afraid to bring up that
subject

  then out of a clear sky the roan
popped up again he was seen chasing
cattle on squaw mountain and the
ranchers immediately laid plans for an-
other hunt the plans were rushed par-
ticularly after thad salter who had
been doing considerable snooping
around on his own hook had brought
in word that the stallion had made his
headquarters in cup canon a blind
arroyo several miles south of squaw
mountain the first hunt had not ex-
tended that far

  owens at this news announced that
the new hunt would first beat squaw
mountain to scare the crafty mustang
to his retreat if he were on the moun-
tain and that then the avengers would
push into cup canon bottling him up
and riding him down until a bullet could
end his career

  well make it wednesday said
owens so all the boys can be notified
no spare hosses this time-just a short
fast sweep over squaw mountain and
then into cup canon everybody meet
here early wednesday mornin start
at eight oclock

  when wednesday came it found a
goodly bunch of riders at eddie owens
and the start was made promptly at
just a cow horse



eight oclock although not all of the
ranchers had come in by that time
with instructions to the cook to send
all tardy ones after the main group
owens pulled out and made fast time
with his cavalcade to squaw mountain
then with much shouting and the oc-
casional pop of a rifle or report of a
six-gun the riders rolled up and over
the densely wooded mountain hoping
that the roan if he were in the timber
was streaking it for his hide-out in cup
canon

  whether it was fate that made floyd
penny late for the rendezvous at
owens is problematical but he was
late the ranch cook obeying instruc-
tions told floyd that owens had said
to follow after and floyd wheeled and
was off but he decided that by cut-
ting down the valley road past silents
ranch he could make better time and
save several miles of riding he took
the short cut and much to his surprise
came upon old silent leaning on the
gate at his place floyd pulled up
more to give his horse a breathing spell
than to talk to silent

   lo si greeted floyd glad to
see yuh back didnt figger yuhd be
up so soon feel all right now

  tolerable replied silent got
back yisterday yuh seem to be in a
big hurry

  pm late fer that posse o eddie
owens said floyd before he thought
pm cuttin in now to beat em over
squaw an meet em at cup canon

  posse echoed old silent eagerly
who they trackin

  the rancher bit his lip realizing he
had let the cat out of the bag but he
decided to enlighten the old man-see-
ing there was no reason to believe that
silent wouldnt be pleased at the news

  why aint yuh heard countered
floyd theyre-were huntin down
that roan stallion that liked to have did
fer yuh hes been killin stock we
got him located now

  huh

  gotta be goin said floyd uneasily
slong

  and  his ride penny grunted to
himself  codger wasnt much ex-
cited about it one way or another
waal hes a heartless ol devil mebbe
i dont blame that roan fer tryin to kill
him-mebbe- 

  but no sooner had penny disappeared
down the road than old silent although
weak and shaky from his long stay in
bed galvanized into action he rushed
to the barn ignoring the questions of
the hired man who had tended the ranch
in his absence and there saddled up one
of the ranch mares fie was mounted
and off in a minute but he did not fol-
low penny instead he forced the
mare through the creek and the last the
hired man saw of them they were dis-
appearing in the timber beyond silent
knew he had no time to lose if he were
to be on the hunt and he also knew a
shorter cut to squaw mountain than
pennys route

  meanwhile the ranchers and the
cowboys with owens had combed
squaw mountain quickly and boister-
ously on the far slope they halted to
rest their horses before plunging into
cup canon the men dismounted
loosed saddle girths and lounged
around resting at owens suggestion
they lingered so that any stragglers
might catch up with them there

  we got the killer bottled in thar
said owens positively ive got a
strong hunch on that-but that aint
sayin we can keep him thar long
enough to shoot im hes a shrewd
devil that stallion is -hes got hidin
down to a fine art but my plan to git
him is this frank campbell here who
is the best shot among us hell wait here
at the mouth o the canon-ready to let
go with his rifle the rest o us will go
in hopin to see that roan ef we do
well shoot-ef we dont an the wily
mustang doubles back on us or sneaks

through our cordon then frank will
pick him off here as he tries to dodge
out

  good ideal eddie

  that way we cant miss gettin
him

  as the posse was mounting prepara-
tory to going in several late comers
arrived including floyd penny the
latter told of seeing old silent breen at
the breen place as he passed penny
did not add that he had stopped to talk
with the old man and no one in the
posse thought of asking at eddie
owens command the horsemen rode in-
to the canon leaving frank campbell
posted some fifty yards inside the
entrance rifle alert ready to pick off
the blue roan if he chanced to break
back for liberty

  as cup canon was some four miles
in length varying in width from a hun-
dred and fifty feet to a quarter of a
mile all densely forested except for
the tiny glacial stream that sifted down
its center the place was an excellent
hide-out for any animal campbell on
guard at the entrance did not doubt but
that the smart outlaw dodging the
riders might at any moment burst into
view headed out of the canon it was
for this reason that campbell stood
tense ready to shoot at a moments
warning it would be everlasting dis-
grace for him if he allowed the blue
roan to breeze past him to safety

  as campbell waited however and
no sound came from the depths of the
canon but the shouting of the riders
who had gone in he gradually relaxed
realizing that the stallion must be ahead
of the beaters or he would have made
a rush for the mouth of the canon be-
fore this a half hour passed and
campbell figured that owens and his
men must be practically halfway along
the blind canon half an hour more
and they would surely reach the high
cliff barrier at the head of the canon
there most likely they would find the

outlaw stallion at bay with  chance
to escape his fate

  suddenly as campbell waited eyes
fixed on the canon mouth he heard a
sound behind him it was ridiculous to
think that the stallion could have
circled but campbell shot a quick look
over his shoulder to gasp in amaze-
ment what he saw was not the runty
roan stallion but a white-faced old man
on a big bay mare

  it was old silent breen looking like
his own ghost campbell turned back
to watch for the stallion and silent
dropped off his mare and staggered up
to campbell who greeted him cheerily

  got im yit asked silent camp-
bell shook his head no-not yit the
rifleman answered apparently the
boys aint flushed him out yit but most

any minnit now i reckon-

  campbell broke off abruptly as the
sounds of thundering hoofs echoed up
the narrow canon he gripped his rifle
tighter

  now he whispered that must be

him-now-

  then old silent breen did a strange
thing he grnbbed for campbells
poised rifle and seemed about to wrench
it from the ranchers hands

  here campbell he cried excitedly
lemme have it i say-lemme have

the rifle i gotta-

  campbell took one look at the old
mans white face and then recollecting
that breen was noted as a dead shot
surrendered

  sure i get yuh silent said camp-
bell yuh want the revenge eh
waal yuh can have it take the gun
-but be sure yuh put a bullet home
be quick hell come roarin out o
that patch o brush like a cyclone
shoot low an ahead o him

  crash out of the timber just as
campbell had predicted catapulted a
runty blue mustang he brought up
with a jerk at the unexpected sight of
the two men bottling the canons
just a cow horse



entrance but old silent breen was as
quick as the stallion

  here bluey-here boy shrilly
called the old man advancing toward
the quivering animal here yuh are
bluey dont yuh know me boy
here here now thats a boy nice
boy nice ol feller nice ol bluey

  the stallion snorting suspiciously
seemed torn between opposite emotions
his instinct told him to wheel and run
for it but his heart urged him to delay
there was something familiar in the
figure approaching him something
familiar in the voice

  nice ol bluey-nice boy wheedled
the old man advancing cautiously
while campbell watched in dismay
nice feller-thats it boy stand still
bluey dont yuh know me good ol
bluey nice bluey here bluey-

  the stallion snorted and started to
rear back

  look out silent cried campbell
lies a-plannin to strike at yuh use
that rifle yuhre close enough pot
him

  but for answer silent dropped the
rifle

  gosh cried campbell jerking out
his six-gun

  he raised it-and just as he pulled
the trigger old silent seeing campbells
moves from the corner of one eye
plunged in front of the trembling stal-
lion there was a needlelike stab in
silents left shoulder and he was
whirled half around but he staggered
on whispering soothingly to the fright-
ened horse that seemed on the verge of
bolting the next minute he had his
arms around the blue roans neck and
was clinging there

  dont shoot campbell he cried
weakly this is my hoss-mine-mine
-an nobody can harm him now

  and while campbell stood open-
mouthed gaping at the strange sight be-
fore him the echo of his shot had re-
called the riders from down the canon

the noise of their coming alarmed the
nervous stallion but old silent clung to
his neck desperately

  thar thar bluey stand still no-
buddy is goin to hurt yuh pore fel-
ler nice bluey soothed silent

  and when the gang arrived fully ex-
pecting to see the blue roan stretched
out in death they tumbled off their
horses in astonishment as great as was
campbells there on the fringe of the
woods quivered the runt stallion and
hanging to him with a wounded shoul-
der was old silent breen

  the posse passed from awe to dis-
gust

  see here silent yuh ol fool chal-
lenged eddie owens what do yuh
think yuhre doin-trying to commit
suicide 

  that stallion is a killer hes been
killin stock on the ranges-killin cattle
-an he nigh kilt yuh

weakly but determinedly thats a
lie mebbe yuh think he did it but he
didnt that day i was hurt-bluey

which knocked bluey down an sent me
sprawlin afore i could git up the bull

  the ranchers eyes popped

who had regained his power of speech
i did that eddie i shot silent
afore i understood i shot at the mus-
tang an silent leaped in front to save

owens laughing in his nervousness

the throbbing throat of the blue roan

wealthy indian spendthrifts

an instance of what the wealthy indians are apt to do with the sudden riches
that have come to them of late years from oil leases is furnished by the
case of an osage indian woman who was released from government guardianship
a little over eighteen months ago and allowed to handle her own affairs her
average annual income from oil royalties and bonuses is twelve thousand dollars
when she was released from government control all the restricted funds held
to her credit with the exception of the sum of  were turned over to her

    a little while ago she applied to the department of the interior for this
 at the same time she filed a statement showing how she had spent
the rest of her money

    this statement showed that she had expended  for a fur coat 
for a diamond ring  for an automobile  for furniture 
to pay loans which she had obtained from her mother and sister  for
shipping furniture from florida to california  loaned to her sister 
as cash payment for a california home  for a lot and  put
into florida real estate the balance of her money was spent for such general
items as clothing traveling expenses income taxes and gifts to her people

on said old zeb prentiss
to his younger partner
tom slade im tellin
you that ive spent forty
years off and on in the
desert and im learnin
somethin new every day but one thing
i learned early and i reckon itll always
stay by me the desert gives you one
chance and if youre honest and fight
squar like a man should youll likely
win but this little old waste of burned
sand which has alius seemed to me like
some sleepin varmint thats ready to
rouse up and bite you unaware hasnt
one inch of space to spare for a man
thats weak physically or morally
the valley through which they were
plodding was a deep elongated hole in
the earth perhaps a mile wide and sev-
eral miles long just now it was burn-
ing dry with the drought that had
gripped the land for several weeks in
the distance were the cool snow-cov-

ered peaks of the little lost river
range and the sight of them was a
mockery to any thirsty traveler

  outwardly prentiss and slade were
unlike and a shrewd judge of human
nature would have guessed that the dis-
similarity went deeper at this mo-
ment it was more marked than ever
zeb prentiss was an old desert rat
gaunt stooped his whiskers bleached
by many suns almost to the neutral hue
of the desert itself yet his squinting
blue eyes were mild and trusting and
his voice was pitched in a companion-
able key

  slade was slender dark and impa-
tient of movement he was given to
scowling much particularly while old
zeb babbled on in his garrulous fashion
-it was as though some weighty
problem had fastened to him prentiss
had by chance met slade at cinnabar
and lonely for a partner had prevailed
upon the younger man to go on this


western story magazine

prospecting trip slade scoffed at first
but later became interested

  old zeb had made good they had
found gold not much it is true-per-
haps fifteen thousand dollars worth-
yet it was more than slade had ever
seen before much less possessed when
the old man with a skill born of long
experience had located color slade
excitedly believed they were going to
become rich yet the find had proved
to be only a pocket the discovery
made slade sulky he felt somehow
that zeb was at fault and when the
old man proposed that they hit for
town and enjoy their new-found
wealth while it lasted after the fashion
of the true desert rat slades irritation
turned to anger he wanted to stay out
in these hills and seek more gold but
old zeb to whom the search for the
precious metal counted for more than
the actual finding was satisfied for the
time being slade finally agreed to re-
turn to cinnabar particularly when it
was pointed out to him that they need-
ed grub and that they couldnt continue
for long to live off the country by-
shooting game

  even now as they made their way
across this last hot valley they had
but a few mouthfuls of food between
them each cafried a canteen covered
with brown canvas into which was
ground alkali dust until the cloth had
become a tawny color the clothing of
both men was powdered with the stuff

  slade was no prospector anyway and
a month of it in the hills had served to
put an edge on his temper until he had
moods that were positively murderous
at this moment with old zeb leading
-slade did not know the trail-the
aged prospectors bent back seemed a
temptation slade allowed his mind to
run free in conjecture as to what would
happen if he should take advantage of
this opportunity inside old zebs shirt
was the other half of that gold and
he slade had the only rifle could he

make a convincing explanation to the
people back in cinnabar as to the reason
why this old prospector hadnt come
back  a fall over a cliff might prove a
plausible story but he couldnt afford
to display the gold that would arouse
suspicion hed merely have to say that
they had failed and that old zeb had
accidentally met death

  yet the thought made him shudder
if there was only some other way
maybe he could rob the old man and
set him afoot the difficulty with that
plan however lay in the fact that he
slade didnt know the trail xo there
was only one way out if he didnt want
prentiss to keep the gold he plodded
on still immersed in his thoughts

  a strange old geezer this prentiss
he had spent most of his life in these
same hills and made pets of wild ani-
mals what good would money do him
anyway hed be just as happy if he
were broke no one would really miss
him if he never came back to cinnabar

  the trail led past a promontory which
overhung the valley here the rocks
of harder substance had resisted the
erosion that had gouged out this valley
which had been the course of a long-
vanished stream from the floor of the
valley to the top of the promontory was
all of two hundred feet although its
scored sides were rough with fallen
rock on the top of the promontory were
clumps of sagebrush now white with
the alkali dust that had sifted over
everything

  yes sir son said old zeb shes
one hot day im goin to set me down
for a little spell and rest well make
tother end of the valley before sun-
down and its just as well not to go
hazin along too fast in this here heat

  he seated himself on a rock wiped
his damp brow and took a sip of water
from his canteen then he calmly
pulled out his pipe filled it with tobacco
which he whittled from a plug and
lighted it only a desert rat who has
teeth of the desert



become inured to the terrific heat of the
sand waste and who has literally be-
come sun-cured could have enjoyed it
as old zei did slade swore a little
under his breath and took a heavy pull
of water from his canteen his moodi-
ness had settled upon him like a cloud

  yes sir shes shore a hot country
son resumed the old man happily rub-
bing- the back of his brown gnarled
hand across his forehead looks jest
the same a it did when i come here
nigh onto twenty year ago dont
charee much does the desert sand
shifts around a little but all in all it
looks jest the same

  i used to have a shack back there
in the hills-theres good water there
but its out of our way it got too lone-
some tor me guess if i hadnt got
tire   f it i wouldnt have come out to
civilization and i wouldnt have run
across you eh

  ues not said slade shortly he
was thinking of something else just
them his fingers rubbing aimlessly
aeamst the barrel of the rifle which lay
acr - his lap old zeb babbled on yet
n v arte then he shot a curious side-
 elance at his companion

  left there about two rears ago i
hah bts of pets in my time-reckon
ive toli you about some of them i
tamed one of these here little desert
wolves or thought i did anyway i
raie i her from a pup and shed hang
around the place pretty close waitin for
me to feed her i reckon shes gone
back plumb wild by now yes sir the
desert is shore a funny place and its
got a way of testin a man

  he broke oft and wras silent and
slade turned to regard him with mild
interest but the old man was staring
up at the lip of the promontory he
chuckled a little

  i jest caught sight of a wolf or
somethin up there he announced
you wouldnt think now that a wolf
would come down out of the hills this

far would you and in daytime too
maybe they prowl down in the valley
at night there must be suthin that
lives in this god-forsaken spot  he
was thoughtful for a moment then
gave a sharp exclamation

  by gravy i wonder if it could
have been that there little wolf i tamed
tom-

  but slade did not hear without ris-
ing he threw up the rifle and fired

  i saw it he exclaimed right up
there by that clump of sagebrush along-
side that rock got it too ill bet
old zeb was regarding him with a hurt
expression in his old blue eyes

  but whyd you want to shoot
tom he demanded that there lit-
tle animal-whatever it was-wouldnt
do you any harm

  slade turned on him

  what dyou know about it he de-
manded ill shoot every varmint i
see dont need any advice from an old
desert rat either

  for a moment he regarded old zeb
truculently the aged prospector did
not move but his blue eyes held those
of the other man without flinching it
was slade himself who broke the spell
whatever thought ran through his
mind as he stood there gripping the
rifle-well it was not the time

  im goin up there and see if i can
find it he decided

  old zeb watched him go saw him
climb slowly over the rock slide toward
the clump of sagebrush at the summit
of the cliff it was a heart-breaking task
in this heat but evidently slades cu-
riosity was aroused now and then he
paused to rest breathing heavily for
the climb was a steep one at last he
reached the top and looked around
carefully

  hit it all right he called down
triumphantly to old zeb theres
blood here the old man said noth-
ing

  he saw slade seat himself slip the


western story magazine

canteen strap off his arm and tilt the
container to his lips for a long drink
the old mans eyes returned to the
dancing haze over the hot sands ahead
while he continued to smoke quietly
after a time he heard slade come
scrambling down the cliffside without
a word the prospector got up and once
more led the way toward the coolness
of the distant hills

  they stopped to rest once more after
a mile and a half of it and then went
on the sun was near the western
horizon now and the heat had a still
breathless intensity that almost cooked
slades lungs old zeb plodding along
the same as ever seemed not to mind
he heard slade swear and stop

  gimme a drink said the man
hoarsely ive lost my canteen some
place of all the crazy things i ever

did in my life- old zeb handed

over his canteen yet retained his hold
on the strap

  easy son he cautioned as slade
gurgled with the neck of the container
at his lips that just leaves us about
out of water if we find that the spring
im dependin on up ahead has dried
up he removed the canteen from
slades lips while it was yet half full

  old zeb found that his fears were
justified when darkness had come
and they had reached the point in the
hills where he had planned to stay until
daylight the depression among rocks
at the base of a little cliff was utterly
dry the sediment in the bottom of the
bowl where the spring had been was
covered with mud seamed by weeks of
drought there was nothing to do but
make a dry camp build a fire and con-
sume the last few mouthfuls of food
with sparing sips from the canteen

  the change which old zeb seemed to
have undergone persisted now and
then as he sat smoking by the fire his
eyes covertly strayed to where his part-
ner moody and preoccupied sat
hunched on a rock

  slade was the first to turn in that
night the stress of that long jaunt
across the burning valley had tired him
immeasurably so he rolled in his blan-
kets and with the rifle beside him
quickly lost himself in slumber for
a long time zeb sat there smoking star-
ing unseeingly into the dying fire

  the chill which marks the usual des-
ert night became more noticeable a
honey-colored moon rose over the hills
turning the clumps of sagebrush to
filigrees of dusted silver and the brush
rattled loosely in a light intermittent
breeze a night bird some desert owl
perhaps moved on hushed wings along
the face of a hill then veered sharply
and struck at something crouching at
the edge of a thicket instantly there
was a shrill wavering cry that sent the
echoes chasing up and down the dry
canons

  slade moved restlessly suddenly he
sat up and looked around the fire was
out but on the opposite side of where
it had been he could see the indistinct
outlines of a form huddled in a blanket

  he regarded it curiously for a long
time without moving or making a
sound all at once he began to move
stealthily he got to his knees and
possessed himself of the rifle then he
deliberately lifted the weapon pointing
it at that huddled form its loud clap-
ping report following a streak of red-
dish-yellow flame that spurted from the
muzzle seemed a profanation of the
profound silence again and again he
shot

  he could see the form flinch as the
bullets struck it at last he jumped to
his feet sprang over and kicked atthe
huddled thing beneath the blankets

  it collapsed oddly with a loose rat-
 te he stooped and tore the blanket
apart beneath it was a small pile of
greasewood sticks which had been
propped up carefully so that outwardly
it had the semblance of a sleeping form
t ricked
teeth of the desert



  for a moment slade stood there rifle
in hand snarling like some cornered
wild beast there was fear in his eyes
now and desperation somewhere out
there in the brush hiding and watching
him no doubt was the old man he had
intended to kill old zeb carried a six-
gun in an armpit holster slade knew
at that moment the old man might be
drawing a bead on him to avenge the at-
tempted murder

  whirling slade leaped for the sage-
brush and went crashing through it
running as though for his life

  a few moments later the darkness
resolved itself into a form which crept
cautiously to where the fire had been
old zeb retrieved the blanket and poked
his fingers in curiosity through the holes
which the bullets had made he shook
his head sorrowfully

  plumb crazy he decided i could
see it in his eyes darned lucky thing
for me that i did too

  fie rolled up the blanket and felt
around in the darkness for his outfit
not daring to strike a match although it
was a certaintv that slade was far away
by that time and probably still going
his fingers rubbed the familiar form of
his canteen

  he took out the stopper after shak-
ing the container and hearing a satis-
fying gurgle and held the neck to his
lips but he put it down without tast-
ing it

  nope he decided i aint as thirsty
right now as im goin to be tommy
slades goin to need a drink of water
too before he gets through with this
hes a cussed low-down would-be
killer but i never left a pard behind yet
i may kill him when i find him but i
gotta find him first reckon hell know
what i was talkin about when i said
this here old desert would bite him if he
didnt shoot squar

  he moved into the brush a little apart
from the place where they had camped
and remained there until daylight with

the first glimmer of dawn he was oft
easily trailing slade in the loose sand

  middays sun was blazing down
fiercely when slade came to the con-
clusion that he was lost in his heart
he knew that he had been lost for some
time but stubbornly he would not
admit it somehow some way hed
beat this game find a trail that led out
of these accursed hills fie still carried
the rifle but he was burning up for a
drink of water

   probably old zeb was trailing him
seeking revenge that for one thing
kept him moving although his muscles
ached with the torture of steady plod-
ding through the hot lifeless sand and
his throat and lips were cracking from
lack of moisture his tongue was
already beginning to swell

  what a fool hed been not to grab
old zebs canteen before he made that
wild flight from the camp he could
go hungry but he couldnt go much
longer without water and what a fool
hed been to lose his canteen the previ-
ous day

  the thought brought him up short
for a moment he remembered now
where that canteen was strange he
hadnt recalled it before when he had
climbed to the top of the cliff to see
what he had shot he had lifted the strap
from his shoulder and taken a drink
laying the canteen alongside the rock he
was sitting on there it was still lying
beyond question

   probably it was the only water within
miles his only chance for life for he
could not keep going much longer with-
out a drink there were not more than
a few good swallows of water left in
it but they were more precious than all
the gold in these hills he must find
the canteen

   but first hed have to find that cliff
up which he had climbed at the mo-
ment he stood at the bottom of a wide
sandy gully which might lead to the


western story magazine

valley up which he and old zeb had
had come the previous day where
zeb was at that particular instant was
unimportant slade was concerned sole-
ly with making a fight against death by
thirst he started down the gully hop-
ing that it would widen out into the
great depression in the earth which he
sought

  half an hour of patient trudging and
he found that it did indeed do that very
thing the whole country hereabout
was vastly strange to him but he was
certain that the plain before him was
the valley far off to the left a good
two miles was a promontory which
looked familiar hed have to chance it
anyway if he could make it that far
hed recover the canteen

  as he plodded on the sun smote him
with renewed force and he felt him-
self growing light-headed he felt as
though he were almost floating in air
as though his feet were barely touch-
ing the earth then this was replaced
by the feeling that his feet were
weighted with lead once he staggered
and fell but came up again the startled
light of fear in his eyes couldnt afford
to fall he might stay down and
very quickly the sun would get him

  ages passed and at last he was quite
sure that the promontory was but a
short distance away yet it might be
an illusive trick that his eyes almost
blinded by the glare and heat were play-
ing upon him fie stopped and tried to
concentrate his faculties clear his
rapidly fogging brain yes the prom-
ontory wasnt far now and how
good that water would taste

  hot what was it that babbling
old fool prentiss had said about the
desert having teeth slade laughed
wildly at the thought it was a good
joke yes the desert had teeth all
right it was showing those same teeth
at him now but hed live to laugh at
them

  he stopped again reeling yet know-

ing that he stood at the very foot of
the promontory almost in the exact
spot where he and old zeb had paused
the previous day it was harder to con-
centrate on the work ahead of him
now somehow he felt as though his
brain was slowly melting his eyes
roved to the summit of the cliff the goal
he would have to attain he could see
the place to which he had climbed the
same clump of sagebrush and then
it seemed he saw something more a
thing which made him gasp with sud-
den fear

  the wolf at which he had shot the
animal old zeb had talked about there
wasnt one chance in ten thousand it
could be the same-yet somehow he
knew that it was he had wounded her
the previous day so that she had
dragged herself off to die of that he
was quite sure yet here she was back
again to haunt him just the gray
shade of her there at the edge of the
sagebrush hiding but it seemed to his
disordered mind that he could see her
head grinning at him

  or was it old zeb himself the hat
of the old prospector just showing
where he lay hidden waiting for slade
to approach the man croaked hys-
terical defiance and raised his gun
which despite his delirium he had not
thrown away hed have to take no
chances one shot must do the trick he
centered all his faculties on the effort
steadying himself with a momentary
rally of will power the rifle spoke and
slade tried to cheer for he knew he
hadnt missed

  he cast the gun from him then
knowing that hed need every ounce of
unhampered strength to make the
climb and began to work slowly up the
rock slide every step was torture but
the thought that held him to it was that
up there lay life-precious water that
would clear his brain save him from
madness

  yet it was slow work painfully slow
teeth of the desert



inch by inch he crept slowly upward
pausing now and then to gather fresh
strength

  he made it at last as a man will bat-
tle to the end to maintain life the
last rock was passed and the ground
leveled out he lay there gasping for
a full minute before he could rally long
enough to search for the canteen gone
was all thought of the wolf even of old
zeb himself he croaked in triumph
as he came on it beside the sagebrush
clump

  tremblingly his fingers fumbled with
the stopper and at last it came free he
could hardly contain himself as he
canted it to his lips but no water
came desperately he sucked at the
mouth of the container  then as the
realization came to him that the canteen
was dry he expended his last effort in
hurling the deceitful thing from him
yet it was a weak effort the canteen
rattled hollowly against the rocks a bare
ten feet away but slade did not hear
it his head had dropped to his arms
and he lay very still the teeth of the
desert had bitten deeply at last

  shadows of the peaks were length-
ened out when zeb prentiss follow-
ing a twisting trail in the sand reached
the foot of the promontory whatever
the mood of the old man when he had
set out to overtake his fleeing partner it
was mild enough now the tracks made
by slade told their own story to old
zeb wise in the ways of the desert

he had hurried faster hoping that he
could be in time for he still had water
with him and he knew that slade had
none

  yet when he saw the discarded rifle
lying in the sand at the foot of the cliff
he knew that he had been too late
would-be murderer though slade was
and deserving of no sympathy never-
theless to the old man he was a partner
who had been merely led astray by his
own cupidity a greenhorn in the des-
ert too was enough to evoke con-
sideration the gun lying there and
the tracks leading to the rock slide-
these things spelled tragedy to the blue
eyes of old zeb prentiss

  slowly he climbed the cliff reaching
the top just as the sun went down in
a blaze of glory behind the distant hills
intuition told him what he would find
yet his eyes did open in surprise at sight
of the canteen so here was the place
slade had left it and remembering
had come back to get it caked with
alkali dust as it was it was the color
of a bleached-out hat-or the coat of a
small desert wolf zeb turned the thing
in his hands and then part of the mys-
tery came to him but the real explana-
tion as seen through the eyes of the
crazed slade he would never know

  plumb crazy he was at the last
remarked the old man softly he done
threw away his only chance for life
he turned the canteen again until he
saw through the bottom of it the jagged
hole made by slades rifle bullet
 t pi ember w we sot talkin

i y i bout crows not so very many
evenins ago well here is
a v st john of elmira new york
whos got some mighty interestin dope
on them old black caw caws

  boss and folks of the round-up 
i am a regular reader of the western
story magazine though not a sub-
scriber and while reading the latest is-
sue this evening made the discovery
that i have been missing a lot of good
stuff by not always reading the round-
up and i want to plead guilty beg for-
giveness and promise to be good in the
future

  referring to what brother white
of west virginia says about crows that
talk i can say that i have often heard
people hereabouts speak of splitting the
tongue also of cutting the tongue to
make them talk but i have never seen
the operation performed nor have i
examined the tongues afterward how-
ever i have known them to become
good talkers i have also known crows
taken when young to become good talk-
ers even though their tongues had never
been tampered with in any way they
are about as good as any parrot and
far tamer and more to be trusted at

large a tame crow is very mischievous
and much given to pilfering small-
and especially bright-articles and hid-
ing them

  we have another american bird that
can be taught to talk exceedingly well
in the magpie only he is a bird of
moods i mean by that that if he takes
a notion to talk all well and good but
if he makes up his mind to be quiet
no amount of talk or persuasion will
induce him to say a single word till
the spirit moves him

  for the benefit of those who may
not be familiar with the magpie i will
say he has the size shape motion and
habits of our familiar blue jay of the
east but in color is black and white
instead of blue and white like the jay
i first met the magpie in northern utah
but the best talker of the species i ever
saw was in a livery barn in columbus
indiana

  should this effort escape the waste-
basket id be glad at another time to
touch on the habits nests eggs et
cetera of the crow

  nothing that i read gives me more
comfort than the western story and
i wish to compliment the author of
white wolf on his insight into the
nature of animals
the round-up



  regular army  who will talk to you
about the endurance powers of horses
and also explain why he does not give
his name commands our complete at-
tention 

  boss and folks just finished
reading your column in the round-up
section and want to say a few words in
regard to the number of miles a horse
will travel in one day at a lope though
it never has been tried at a lope in the
army i can give you an idea of hikes
made in the army by two or three caval-
ry regiments

  troop g of the eleventh cavalry
during the war with spain in cuba
marched one hundred and thirty-eight
miles in twelve hours incidentally i
might say that this troop holds the
worlds record for a march and en-
durance hike at the end of the hike
all men were present and all horses
were in the best of shape except that
they were tired

  the twelfth cavalry in  in the
philippines marched ninety miles
through the rocky country there in pur-
suit of the moros

  the other one is the seventh cav-
alry now stationed at fort bliss texas
and i can say quite a few of the people
who made this hike will verify my state-
ment in  during the hostilities
with mexico in eleven days the third
squadron of the seventh cavalry
marched eight hundred and eightv-six
miles in eleven days into mexico over
the mountains and uncut paths

  this is all i have to say pardon
me for not giving my name but in the
service it is best not to i am an old
soldier nineteen years in and most of
it has been spent in the mounted serv-
ice in the cavalry and field artillery and
am a native of the west

  while we are on horses well hear a
man who shoes em j ii wilson 
south seventh street san jose cali-
fornia

  boss and folks i have read the
western story magazine for two
years without missing one and i dont
think there has been even an ad i have
missed now if you will excuse me
for butting in i would like to say a
few things about horses i have been
a blacksmith for about thirty years i
have shod pretty nearly every kind of
a horse there is and i know that you
can handle most of them with kind-
ness i have shod some that other
smiths had to throw to shoe and i
never put a rope on them the great
trouble with most men is that they are
afraid of them if a horse finds out
you are afraid of him you may just
as well leave him alone i never al-
lowed a horse to be whipped in my
shop not by my men nor its owner if
a man brought a horse into my shop
and started to whip him i simply told
him if he wanted rne to shoe him just
leave him alone or take him out of my
shop

  now about six-guns-i am used to
colts and smith  wesson i started
with a colt old cap and ball when i was
twelve years old and i have had a gun
ever since i worked for miller and
gus two years and i used most of
my wages on ammunition now i dont
want any one to think i am bragging
but i was a pretty good shot i am
fifty-six years old no but with my
automatic there dont many jacks get
away 

  heres some more shootin and-a
little poem on the subject thrown in
what do you know about that r e
monroe new castle indiana speaks

  boss of the round-up and folks 
excuse my sticking in around the circle
but as a reader and an admirer of
western story magazine for six
years i believe i am within my rights
buddies ive handled guns some or be-
lieve i have anyway having spent five
years in service with uncle sam ive


western story magazine

carried s sidearms sixes and auto-
matics and shot em too they are
good guns i prefer the auto for its
speed and recoil if kept clean and
handled correctly it will not jam with
your holster strapped to your leg at an
even length with your hand it will give
you service unsurpassable at least i
found it so

  i would like to hear of others who
think the auto is a good gun to cotton
to now ill give you that little poem

the boss was kiddin me about dont
go throwiu anything now not till i
get a chance to duck behind that chuck

   miss helen rivers who conducts this department will see to it that you will be
able to make friends with other readers though thousands of miles may separate you
it must be understood that miss rivers will undertake to exchange letters only be-
tween men and men boys and boys women and women girls and girls letters
will be forwarded direct when correspondents so wish otherwise they will be an-
swered here be sure to inclose forwarding postage when sending letters through
the hoiiow tree

the argument about the golden
state started a while back by r
c n in which native sons and
gangsters from other states have bad
their say has aroused so much interest
that letters are pouring into the tree
on the subject i wish it were possible
to read all of them out in full

  heres one couple mr and mrs f
camp of  knickerbocker avenue
rochester new york who write mr
r c n may be right or he may be
wrong about conditions in california
but here is one family that is going to
find out for itself i am a good print-
ing-press man also a first-class barber
and have been out of work only two
weeks in seventeen years maybe that
is why i feel sure of finding work out
there if there are gangsters in south-
ern california who care to send their
address mr and mrs camp will be
glad to look them up and shake hands
with them

  this advice is offered to california-
bound folks by a man from montana
who has lived in the golden state for
seven years look over the state
travel up the coast stay a few days in
each town you will soon find one that

will suit you there are millions of
acres of land undeveloped in california
just waiting for somebody with back-
bone to go ahead and develop them
this brother also says that he landed
in the state with eight children and
nothing but his hands and the clothes
they wore and there has never been a
day since that he could not get work
he is a builder

  m w s of gridley has always been
able to get work in california too he
states if he would accept the price of-
fered you will find drawbacks in
every state says he

  the nevadan has a few words to put
in california can boast many east-
erners who make their living here and
who are loyal and true june rose
golden state girl also polly its people
of your caliber who make life worth
living

  a j s of hayward contradicts pol-
lys statement that california has as
much snow as any other state says
he the lowlands are practically free
of snow the only places where it does
snow to any great extent are those above
three thousand feet elevation regard-
ing the possibility of securing work at


western story magazine

a good wage conditions in the southern
part of the state are not as good as they
are in the central and northern parts

 w l proctor of dallas texas
writes an indignant californian
says that a little valley fifty miles long
and thirty miles wide puts out over two
thirds of the worlds supply of fruit
to take the statistics of the united
states this statement must be all wrong
as arkansas missouri tennessee mis-
sissippi and texas all supply a good
portion of our fruit tennesse and ar-
kansas have been the two leading states
for several years in strawberries and
arkansas has the largest peach orchard
in the world anybody else anything
to say about this

 a native daughter wants to put in
her bit

  dear miss rivers california it is a
god-given boon to mankind do you wish
snow in winter go to the northern part of
the state sunshine and flowers for the win-
ter go to southern california work
anywhere on this condition that you are sin-
cere in wanting work in the northern part
are great agricultural ranches lumber mills
construction work the southern part is dif-
ferent there arc small truck gardens chicken
ranches citrus groves oil fields i wonder if
some people know that oil is what makes it
possible for long beach to live the peo-
ple built their city on oil by oil and now
they eat and clothe themselves through that
oil

  i live in long beach but have been from the
oregon line to mexico three times and across
the state five times so ive seen a great deal
of california i say come to california but
do not come expecting wealth to fall into your
hands health will come to you unbidden but
wealth must be sought by wealth i do not
mean only money but joy and contentment
and then the money will follow

 dear hollow tree and sax diego san

in northern california while we do not have
groves all the same you can find oranges in
shasta county as for the mud you mention

i dont understand we dont know what mud
is and as for fruit san diego you will have
to show me where you raise more than we do
i can take you to siskiyou county and on
one small place can show you every kind
you want to look for and lots of it i am
afraid our thousand wonders has it all over
you folks i do know the state from end to
end san diego	shasta daisy

  june rose shasta daisy would be
glad to hear from you

  barney mcmanus of nevada wants
to join in the argument

  dear gang why do ninety per cent of
the people who go to california and return to
their native states eventually drift back to
the golden state i have traveled in over
half the states in the union and am in a posi-
tion to know

  now h c m of los angeles you say you
have been there for five years and only worked
about one fifth of the time did you really
want work or didnt you if you went out
and looked for work and couldnt find it your
case is very strange

  and surely f d h of oakland you dont
think san francisco and oakland are all the
cities in california do you have you tried
going to any other part of the state and see-
ing how the climate there affects your wifes
health if youll just go south where there
is a dry climate im sure her health will im-
prove immensely

   california has this state cr any other i was
ever in beat a mile when i get back and feel
like migrating you may be sure it will all be
done within the boundaries of sunny califor-
nia

  looks like an argument within an
argument has done riz up northern
california vs southern california

  dear hollow tree and shasta daisy
shasta daisy ill back you up until los an-
geles incorporates san francisco my word
san diego didnt you know that l a com-
pletely covers southern california  my home
is in los angeles but i havent lived there
for several years i dont savvy mex and
am not an iowan farmer

   san diego since you left the old folks back
in iowa and settled in san diego you have
never been north or you would know that the
entire sacramento valley raises oranges also
oranges are raised as far north as cloverdale

  earle farish - street bakers-
field california who is not a native but
has lived for four years in the state
disagrees with h c m about its being

no place for a wage earner a me-
chanic who is worth fifty dollars a week
in new york can make seventy-five
here he states if you dont believe
it mr h c m before you start walk-
ing back drop in and pay us a visit
there is always a demand for a-l
mechanics here and they pay as high
as two dollars an hour so if you want
to make that stake to return to new
york come and get it its only a hun-
dred and thirty miles from los angeles
to bakersfield

 walsh from los angeles says

  as i see it the more people that come here
the more there are to feed consequently the
number of grocery stores should increase hir-
ing help the canneries bakeries and slaugh-
terhouses would need more help for their ma-
chinery baking et cetera then too here
is the end of the railroad coming from the
east the shops of the southern pacific
union pacific and santa fe are immense i
say that work for the right man is not hard
to get to contradict a statement of h c
m only apprentices in their second stage get
the wages he wrote of the conscientious
man knowing his business gets from fifty
dollars upward

  what about the orange lemon and walnut
growers south of the city here and the rose
gardens south of san francisco how did
their owners begin there are thousands of
different opportunities waiting for the right
seeker but its like prospecting hard work

  i will admit that many of the laborers here
are- mexicans but they are the most willing
workers we have a warm climate here their

       western trails-el camino real

this modern motor road fully
keeps up the reputation of its
name as a royal road camino
real given to it in the old days of
spanish dominion in california as
public roads in great britain are kings
highways so in spain they are royal
roads and while this route was familiar-
ly known to the natives as the trail of
the padres it was el camino real
officially and has retained its spanish
name

  for seventy-five years the padres
traveled along this road to and from
their various missions from san fran-
cisco to san diego sometimes on foot
sometimes astride hardy little burros
packed to the limit with necessaries for
the journey and supplies for the mis-
sion houses in course of time the
trail became a well-beaten and popular
path for pack trains and riders then
the stage coach rattled over its long

course followed by the railway now
there is a constantly increasing automo-
bile traffic that rolls merrily over the
smoothly-paved highway built to meet
modern conditions and giving pleasure
to thousands of motorists on every day
of the whole year

  it has been said that the climate on
the california coast is the most delight-
ful in the united states and some go
so far as to affirm that there is nothing
to equal it in the whole wide world
certain it is that in summer the nights
are cool enough to require a blanket
while in winter the warm ocean current
keeps the temperature at a comfortable
figure el camino real is clear of
snow during the winter and is beautiful
at all seasons with no scorching sun
in summer and no pinching cold winds
in winter

  while flowers bloom on the ocean
side of the mountain range throughout
where to go and how to get there



the year the spring is the time when the
region is in its full beauty for at this
season the whole length of the route is
in bloom while miles of blossoming
orchards in the vicinity are a delight to
behold

  many take the trip over el camino
real simply for the pleasure and the
health-giving qualities of the outing but
there are others who do so with a view
to picking out a future home site in a
section where the climate is dependable
these should not neglect the many side
trips that invite the motorist to turn
from the main highway and follow a
well-graveled or dirt road leading to
some historic spot or to a stretch of
seashore or flourishing orange groves
or perhaps to some famous hot springs
of proved medicinal qualities all these
will be of interest whether one is out
for pleasure or with the idea of hitting
upon a location for a little farm or for
a place in which to start business anew
or for a spot to which one may retire
from time to time to rest from the
worlds cares and enjoy natures gifts
at their best

  leaving san diego where we arrived
last week by the old spanish trail el
camino real runs north for many miles
following closely the ocean shore and
passing the picturesque ruins of the fa-
mous mission of san juan capistrano
which have been partly restored every
sunday during the summer months
services are held here and the mission
pageant is presented for the benefit of
visitors and to raise funds for the fur-
ther restoration of the ruins

  there are good hotel accommodations
all along the many miles of this his-
toric highway from the more expensive

types to the most modest and a num-
ber of very excellent camping sites are
to be found within easy distance of the
cities

  from san juan capistrano the route
leaves the coast and runs inland through
the towns of santa ana and anaheim
to los angeles this city is known
far and wide for its well-paved boule-
vards and highways as well as for its
orange groves and orchards no mo-
torist passes through without making a
good stop-over all are welcome and
every accommodation to suit all purses
may be found here

good advice from scout lake

  dear mr north  i was interested in the
letter in western story magazine asking
about willow bunch saskatchewan i have
lived sixteen miles west of willow bunch
near scout lake for some time it is twelve
miles south of verwood on the canadian na-
tional railway which is not yet working there
as it has only just been finished

  the land is rolling prairie and is the most
fertile in canada the price ranges from fif-
teen to forty dollars an acre and there are
lots of farms for sale the best way to get
them is to go out among the farmers the
hardest part is to get into a district where the
water is good and this should be found out
before buying the best way is to live among
the farmers for a while they dont charge
any more for food and lodging than others
it is good also to observe the customs of the
country and not try to give the old-timers too
many points on etiquette they might not
take kindly to the new ideas

    eat two or three cakes regularly every day
  before meals on crackers-in fruit juices
  water or milk-or just plain nibbled from the
  cake for constipation especially dissolve one
  cake in hot water not scalding before breakfast
  and at bedtime buy several cakes at a time-

babe ruths home run feet

it isnt always the length of the

times its the speed in getting
around the bases so i have to
keep my feet in prime shape

so writes babe ruth-the
famous bambino of the new
york yankees

ball players are prone to
corns our feet get pretty rough
service but i keep mine free of
corns by putting on a bluejay
whenever a potential corn ap-
pears in the offing

when trouble is afoot-have bluejay at
hand for  years it has been the standard
home corrvremover ask your physician or
chiropodist bluejay goes to the root of the
matter and routs the troublesome offender-

   close shave-better than youve ever had be-
   fore a shave that stays all day

     and if youve got a tender shave-every-
   other-day skin your razor goes through literally
   without any pull or scrapy feeling a clean
   smooth de-bearding every day

     next a little squeeze of mennen skin balm
   rubbed over the shaved area tingling cooling
   refreshing tones up the tissue-soothes any
