to ambitious bookkeepers and junior accountants-

are you getting ahead the speedy way

-or the slow way

heres how you can find out answer these questions

	do you know why the management asks for each set of figures that you prepare

             	do you see clearly how those figures will shape company policies

             	do you daily interpret your books and your records in terms of profit and loss to your i

             	in short is your day-to-day work full of meaning to you or is it just humdrum routine

your answers to those questions would give
an experienced personnel man a picture of
your entire future

  for only to the man or woman who knows
what its all about does speedy worthwhile pro-
motion come the routine worker goes ahead
at a snails pace-if at all

  yet knowing what its all about in bookkeep-
ing and accounting is within reach of almost
any office worker-provided he has ambition
enough to train earnestly

  the road is clearly marked and an average per-
son-like you-can travel it if he really wants to

  naturally it takes real work-work that even
lasalle after  years can only cut down not
cut out entirely

  but lasalle can and does make your study
interesting-easy to understand-useful right on
your present job-if you will do your part

  of course your time for the movies the card-
table and the radio will be somewhat less than
that of those who sit and merely hope for pro-
motion or wish for a raise but the hours you
sacrifice now earn
hard cash profits for
you in the future

hundreds yes thousands just like you have
proved that lasalle-trained accountants can earn
-   and even more their
stories are so interesting-so full of encourage-
ment-that we have published a whole book of
them success reports

  this book is jam-packed with human interest
experiences that show how bookkeepers and
junior accountants who once were discouraged
cogs in the business machine have today become
important executives auditors comptrollers and
certified public accountants-with good incomes
and with all the prestige of real business success

  over and over you find such phrases as then
came my second raise-so then they made me
manager-that first increase completely paid
for my training the first two months

  to anyone interested-really ambitious-we
will gladly send a copy of this book absolutely
jree it has been a true inspiration to many a
real help to all who have read it

  would you like a copy without the slightest
obligation then mail the coupon and we will

  forward it by return

tom priestley a pauper good
lord here for thirty years ive

the young millionaire dropped the
note he had just read and threw his tall

                              copyrighted  by the
                              

well-knit figure into the big upholstered
chair in which he had been reclining
luxuriously a moment before with no
thought of ever sitting on any other kind
of furniture

  now he lay limp like a man who had
been counted out of the prize ring his
friend bob slade stared at him in amaze-
ment from the other side of the library
table

  for a full minute tom offered no

frank a munsey co

a motley crew of cutthroats
emerged from the beached long-
boats and approached

the strange adventure of a young man whom science enables to project
himself into the lives of friends and enemies one exciting new years eve-
on the brink of 



further explanation of his remarkable
statement and slade was too delicate
to break in upon his mood

  what in heavens name can i do with
myself he went on at length seeming
to forget his friends presence and ad-
dressing his remarks to the ceiling i
cant earn enough money to buy my neck-
ties never earned a cent in my life if
only old grandfather priestley had cut
us off at once and given my father a
chance to educate me to something use-
ful it wouldnt be so bad

  priestley then realized he was talking
to himself and turned to his friend

  bobby old boy yours truly is up
against it for fair well no priestley ever
cried when he was downed even if they
have lacked practice in real difficulties
for two pampered generations

  slade rose and came over to his friends
chair he was a short fair studious-look-
ing man the direct contrast of his friend
priestley

  it was a singular providence that in
this moment of unexpected calamity tom
should have with him the only man who
ever to any extent shared his confidences

  what is it old fellow asked slade
are you joking certainly you havent
been losing money at any such rate tell
me if you care to if not ill understand
priestley picked up the letter from the
floor it was from a well-known law firm
on the two hundred and tenth floor of
the new cosmopolitan building

  read that he said handing it to
his friend it ran

  mr thomas priestley

  suite  floor 

  new waldorf city

  my dear mr priestley

    it is my painful duty to break some seri-
  ous news to you at once

    i have learned today that maurice fair-
  weather oldest son of your aunt jane did
  not die as supposed but later married and
  has three surviving heirs horace fair-
  weather of chicago mrs samuel foy of
  bridleville ohio and george fairweather
  who when last heard from was workntg as
  surveyor on the new route of intercon-

  tinental monorail company

    of course it goes without saying that at
  this hour it is impossible to communicate
  with all three of these persons and as a
  consequence by the terms of your grand-
  fathers singular will your fortune will
  revert at midnight to the united states
  government believe me aside from all pro-
  fessional connections you have my heart-
  felt sympathy

                          sincerely

  let me give you a little family his-
tory said priestley after slade had read
the letter i have told even you very
little about it you see my grandfather
old andrew priestley was one of the self-
made millionaires

  the war on predatory wealth grew so
hot in the last half of the twentieth cen-
tury that the old gentleman turned pessi-
mistic and predicted by the end of the
century all our private property would
be confiscated anyhow and came near
giving it away on the spot he com-
promised however

  he decided that if by now our estates
werent absorbed they should be given
voluntarily to the government to use in
promoting industrial colonies for the poor
unless all his descendants should agree to
turn over the entire fortune and its income
to my fathers oldest male descendant-
myself as it happens he feared you see
that by this time the old methods of in-
creasing fortunes would be done away
with and that if the estate were sub-
divided from generation to generation it
would at last disappear altogether

  so he provided that if personal for-
tunes were still allowed by law the priest-
ley name and prestige would be preserved
if the living members of the family so
wished hence the will left ample incomes
to the other heirs and their heirs until
the end of the century and the principal
of the estate to my father and his oldest
male heir in each successive generation

  now as the century drew to a close we
hustled around and got all the heirs to
sign away their claim to me which they


famous fantastic mysteries

did when they found the will could not
be broken and i made it right with them
by deeding them ample livings my grand-
fathers fears of confiscation werent
realized and i was prepared to enjoy an
untrammeled fortune and perhaps in-
crease it enough so that i could treat the
other heirs even better than i have and
still preserve the dignity of the priestley
name now at the last minute bob up
three heirs whose existence was before
unknown hence exit the priestley for-
tune

slades hand rested on his friends
shoulder in silent sympathy there was
a true bond of friendship between them
despite their difference of opinion and
condition

  bob slade was a liberal of the modern
type while he believed in private pro-
perty he considered huge fortunes a
curse and had long striven with priestley
to get him to turn over his huge surplus
to a cooperative industrial colony which
slade was promoting

  he now in his heart felt that the loss
of wealth would be the real making of
tom priestley yet friendship prompted a
feeling of keenest pity for the young man
thus suddenly thrown on his own untried
natural resources

  yet there was a bit of yellow in slade
he could not help rejoicing that this for-
tune had gone to the common cause and
he likewise hoped now to get the popular
young millionaire into his colony

  old man slade said at length you
are now going to show the stuff that is in
you you know i sympathize with you
but what you want is counsel not idle
sympathy you are at the beginning of
this new century commencing to live and
the loss of this wealth has shown the way

  join our association and there will
be plenty of work for you to do and a
comfortable living and respectable posi-
tion the men of our colony are winning
more and more respect as time goes on
we are the real answer to your grand-
fathers fears

  private fortunes and private enter-
prises still exist and will exist till men
through cooperation learn voluntarily to
give over to the common cause what they
cannot use personally come ill take you
to our watch-night meeting and you shall
join us with the opening of the new year

  the two young men were now stand-
ing facing each other

  priestley for some moments considered
his friends words here was indeed a
way out

  the new colony was a popular fad
many persons of means had dedicated
their property and lives to the cause

  but the tempation was brief suddenly
and almost roughly he threw his friends
hand from his shoulder the spirit of old
andrew priestley was swelling in the heart
of his grandson

  bob he said no you may be right
your words are tempting they offer me
the easiest way-perhaps the right way
but i will fight it out just as old grand-
father priestley fought his battles and as
he would fight this one

  i despised and flaunted your socialistic
colony while i had wealth i will not creep
into it now begging for a chance i will
go out tonight and begin again at the
bottom of the ladder as my grandfather
did and by heavenill win fame and
fortune by my own old-fashioned indivi-
dual efforts as he did

   ill start tonight and ill get a flying
start this time i start right and if i win
fortune ill use it in my own way to help
humanity bobby ill do this the moment
i have back in my possession where it
cant get away twenty million dollars ill
turn over to you one million to use as you
will

  he paused a moment there was a new
fire in his eye

  bob he went on advancing and rais-
ing his voice there are four hours left
till midnight no one but you and my
discreet lawyers know i have lost my
fortune much can be done with my
resources and credit in that time perhaps
you think im crazy but something tells
on the brink of 



me that before the new years bells ring
in old trinity tower i shall win back every
cent of that twenty million dollars cornel
there is no time to waste 

chapter ii

the eve of a century

bob slades spirits fell much farther
and faster than did the little private
elevator in the instant of time it took
the two young men to reach the lobby
of the great hotel sixty-five stories below

  he had long labored to obtain the
cooperation of his dearest friend in his
dearest scheme now when he thought
he had secured it and his friends fortune
besides he found it farther away than ever

  as he stepped out into the brilliantly
lighted moving sidewalk tunnel on the
second level below the street surface slade
paused

  should he leave priestley here and go
to the meeting of his association as he
had planned

  then he remembered priestleys promise
to give him personally one million dollars
as soon as he had won back his twenty
million

  for the moment he believed toms
boast that he would recover his huge for-
tune in the four hours that remained till
midnight he decided to go with him

  how many people are traveling about
in summer clothes since this tube was
opened remarked tom as they stepped
from the stationary sidewalk to the first
of the series of moving ones that carried
them north each running a little faster
than the other you see they can get
the whole length of broadway now from
any of the big apartment-hotels on the
island without going into the open air
doesnt look much like the january street
scenes even you and i can remember when
furs and heavy overcoats were in evidence
those radium roof-lights are as good as
sunlight and smell that air i swear if
youd close your eyes so you couldnvsee
those polished concrete arches overhead
youd say you were in bermuda

  tom was apparently in excellent spirits
or was it bravado slade could not be
sure

  they crossed from one platform to
another through the gaily dressed new
years eve throng till they reached the
north-bound center walk which was pro-
vided with comfortable cross-seats and
was moving at a rate of fifty miles an
hour

  i want to see horace breen in the
getty square apartments at four hun-
dred and tenth street said priestley as
they sat down i guess if we get off at
seventy-second street and go down to the
express-train level well gain time i know
breen will be in because he told me this
afternoon he was entertaining a new
years eve party in his rooms this eve-
ning you see i happened to have a little
talk about several good stocks that were
down too low just now and he urged me
to buy then but i told him i wasnt
speculating now i have a plan that will
work miracles

  at that moment the indicator showed
the approach to seventy-second street
and the two stepped across the platforms
into the big moving stairway the next
moment they were seated in a roomy
comfortable train that would have done
justice to a trunk-line in the nineteenth
century except that it ran on a single
rail like a series of bicycles

  a soft-toned bell rang in the vestibule
an indicator in the end of the car an-
nounced the next stop the door closed
noiselessly and without jar or racket of
any sort the train was under way and in
half a minute making one hundred miles
an hour

  i was reading an old newspaper file
today remarked slade in which the
writer was bitterly bewailing the noise
jam and stench of the subway fifty years
ago

  ive heard my father tell about it
too and do you know i wonder that any-
body could have been induced to live in
this city in those days what a tremendous
change in a century


famous fantastic mysteries

this soliloquy was cut short by arrival
at their station they stepped into
the vestibule of one of those magnificent
towers that line broadway for forty miles
up the hudson river they were roomy
airy winter residences to which all the
well-to-do of the northeastern states
flocked during the holidays

  an elevator took them to the seventy-
third floor where they were ushered into
the presence of horace breen a middle-
aged broker whose financial skill was
rapidly winning him renown in wall street

  after a few preliminary remarks priest-
ley went straight to the point and pro-
posed to his host a financial scheme that
made the heart of the now eager slade
bound with confidence he already felt
that million-dollar check in his fingers he
had to remind himself though that the
money was not for his personal comfort
but for the cause

  mr breen said priestley i dont
need to talk much for you know the
scheme better than i you said this after-
noon that you could double your money
day after tomorrow if you have a few
million dollars more credit i will make it
twenty million as you perhaps know my
private fortune is rated at that figure
ill stake my entire credit to that amount
at this moment

  here is a list of my securities phone
to ten different brokers right now and
place with them orders of two million each
on those stocks you mentioned on ten-
point margins then you can place your
own money yourself

  as soon as the exchange opens day
after tomorrow our orders go in simultan-
eously we have our stock in hand before
the street realizes what has happened
then with such buying the stock will
jump and in half an hour we can sell out
at double our money is it a bargain v

  such a coup had not been worked since
the gormley deal forty years before it
was fresh again the broker eyed this
enthusiastic novice in finance strangely for
a moment then recovered himself and
said hastily to be sure to be sure ill

call up some people at once excuse me
while i telephone

  in half an hour the broker returned

  it is all right he said- now as a
matter of form you will have to sign these
papers to conform to the new law you see
up to now any one known to be worth
twenty million dollars could get credit for
that amount in a stock deal with brokers
who knew him on a quick change like
this he could buy margins for that amount
and not hand over any money till after
the deal was closed you i think expected
to do that but i suppose we were getting
too free there was danger of another
gormley deal

  the new anti-stock gambling law goes
into effect tonight and it requires that a
ipan sign a bond certifying that he owns
free of encumbrance in his own right pro-
perty of some sort equal to the full amount
of his stock transaction before he can buy
any stock at all

  now of course i know you are all
right you understand but we will have
to conform to the statute our blessed
meddling reformers have foisted upon us
you see the good old days of real stock
gambling pass at midnight tonight but we
can work one final coup and clean up some
fortunes from the wreck if you have
twenty million of loose securities actually
to put up

  priestley took the bond and drew out
his stylograph in a daze

  you mean he stammered that-
that i must certify under penalty of im-
prisonment for false statement that at the
time of my transaction i am actually
worth twenty million dollars this trans-
action wont actually take place till after
new years day

  exactly said breen that should
not trouble the grandson of andrew priest-
ley

  the broker laughed pleasantly then
checked himself as he observed the strange
look on the young mans face for some
moments neither spoke the silence grew
decidedly embarrassing at length tom
rose and put down the bond
on the brink of 



  i am sorry mr breen he said but
ill have to change my mind a reason-
has-has-just occurred to me why i
should not undertake this deal after all

  breen stared at priestley in amazement

  so this is the way you do business is
it he said coldly you have got me
into a nice compromising position havent
you i think an explanation is due me

  priestley rose falteringly

  mr breen he said i can only ex-
plain this much there is a provision in
my grandfathers will so tying up my for-
tune that i cannot sign any such bond as
this i was unaware of the law when i came
to you

  we had better not talk any further
replied the broker coldly i am accus-
tomed to do busines with men who under-
stand what they are doing

  the next moment the two young men
were in the open street

  i want to walk and think was toms
explanation as they stopped at the street-
level landing

  for three blocks they walked through
the merry throng of revelers priestley
oblivious of all around him finally he
stopped and faced slade

  i guess its the bottom of the ladder
and the pick and shovel for me after all
he said the dawn of this blessed new
century has swept away even my credit

chapter iii

another chance gone

at that moment two men emerged
from the subway exit the younger
of them caught sight of priestley and
slapped him on the shoulder

  hallo old man he shouted great
luck catching you i have some important
remarks to make good night and happy
new year to you he added to his com-
panion of the subway an elderly gentle-
man who was evidently a little the worse
for new years eve cheer

  ive been trying to get rid of old hol-
den all the way up he has a melancholy
drunk went on the young man as the

older man after staring stupidly at the
group for a moment walked away i took
him down to hear trinity chimes just to
humor him knowing they wouldnt ring
for four hours and thinking hed get tired
of waiting as he did he was sore because
they didnt crowd the streets and make a
hideous racket as they used to new years
eve when he was a boy

  he bought a horn in spite of all 
could do and blew it till a cop took it
away from him then he decided to come
uptown and all the way he speculated on
the great loss to the country that will be
occasioned tomorrow when they have to
change the first two figures of the standing
dates on all their stationery from -
to - hell get home all right now

  this is mr wrenn bob-frederick
wrenn said tom introducing slade
mr wrenn mr slade

  i have heard of mr slade rejoined
wrenn pleasantly he is known both as
a radical and a friend of yours but here
is what i am after and i think mr slade
will enjoy the experience too we have
a novel new years eve in store for us
if you have nothing better and inci-
dentally tommy there is an opportunity
for you to invest some money at a big
profit

  old professor rufus fleckner whom
i have the honor of knowing has made
another invention the greatest yet he is
going to give the first exhibition tonight
to a few friends he invited me and said
i might bring a couple of pals i tried to
find you this afternoon

  mr fleckner needs some capital to put
this thing on the market he needs a lot
and there is a chance to double an invest-
ment i suggested you as a possibility and
he was impressed with what i told him
about you an you come along it is
just about time he was going to begin
at nine oclock he lives just around the
corner and we can make it in a minute

  ill go said priestley without hesita-
tion there was a renewed fire in his eye
and a return of the hope he had lost while
interviewing breen come bob


famous fantastic mysteries

  indeed the name of professor fleckner
was one to conjure with several huge
fortunes had been made by the backers of
this wizards inventions

  he was no idle visionary the successor
of thomas a edison of the previous cen-
tury he accomplished marvels of which
the earlier inventor had never dreamed
he it was who perfected television which
transmitted the voice and image around
the world without intermediate stations
and made it impossibe for any other re-
ceiver to cut in on the message except the
one intended

  his method of extracting electrical power
directly from the atmosphere had forever
done away with the need of coal and
relegated water-power to the limbo of
historic curiosities his greatest service to
mankind had been the enforcing of uni-
versal peace by the invention of the
violet-ray destroyer with which one man
could press a button and annihilate an
army

  hence when priestley learned that
fleckner had another invention ready to
place on the market he knew that the
man in on the ground floor with capital
would reap millions of profit in a short
time

  there were still three hours left during
which he was a full-fledged millionaire
instantly a plan flashed through his mind

  the next moment they entered the
wizards apartments in the tower of one of
the highest buildings on yonkers heights
slade and priestley were alone for a mo-
ment in the coat-room

  dont worry old man said the latter
i wont get caught this time if this
invention is all right as of course it must
be ill know it in half an hour all ive
got to do is call up a few of my millionaire
friends tell them i am financing something
of fleckners promise each a bonus in
fleckners stock and security for a loan
in bonds i hold and i can nail down to my
own name the lions share in the com-
pany the old mans not a close financier
and wont probe me too closely i will
play square with him too

  as they entered the inventors labora-
tory where a dozen men were gathered
the -professor was just beginning an in-
formal lecture

  i am about to revolutionize society
and all its present organization were the
first words the newcomers heard you all
know what i have done with television
he went on i have followed up those
experiments till i have perfected an ap-
paratus which truly makes distance a
thing of the past

  these remarkable words roused priestley
from his unpleasant reverie

  he realized that the little audience in
the laboratory had subsided into a breath-
less awed silence

professor fleckner stood in
front of what appeared to be a giant
television screen surrounded by compli-
cated electrical machinery his piercing
eyes fixed on those before him with an in-
fluence almost hypnotic for a full minute
after uttering his amazing statement the
wizard stood in impressive silence

  you before me are about to take part
in the most remarkable watch-night the
world has even seen he went on at length
from this evening the wonders of the
arabian nights will be trivial common-
place i stand at the entrance to a new
century and with the magic wand of
science i tear away the veil that has
hitherto kept nations apart and retarded
human progress-the dense veil of dis-
tance

  the speaker paused a moment then
added with still greater emphasis

  i have made travel a thing of the
past 

  there was now a little hum of excite-
ment around the room from some ex-
clamations of wonder from others mur-
murs of doubt priestley sat drinking in
the inventors every word in his face the
rapt look of reviving hope

  to prove my claim is not idle specula-
tion or a figure of speech professor
fleckner continued i am going to per-
mit you tonight to take part in new years
on the brink of 



watch-meetings in every portion of the
world and that without leaving this room
time will come when with this instrument
i will penetrate the baffling mysteries of
the starry planets that would be only
another slight step but for the present
my currents will act successfully only in
the atmospheric envelope of the earth

  as the professor finished speaking he
switched on the pqwer the screen before
them seemed to melt away and suddenly
the gathering found themselves looking
at the street at the base of the great build-
ing in which they were all seated

  a little newsboy apparently only a few
feet from them was haggling with another
over some change every word came to
them clearly as over a radio

  one of the gentlemen stepped out on
the balcony and looked-over several others
followed there so far below that they
seemed like mannikins were the two news-
boys the hum of the crowds came up

  the professor moved a controlling lever
and the room in which they were sitting
seemed to glide along the curb far up
the street the watchers from the balcony
could see the portals of one of the biggest
hotels on yonkers heights in a moment
as they looked back into the room at the
screen they seemed to be standing directly
in front of those very portals a young
lady and gentleman stood a little at one
side of the entrance supposedly in a confi-
dential conversation but to the amusement
of the onlookers every word was as though
spoken clearly in their ears

  but professor said one of the party
stepping back inside how is it done
there certainly is no transmitting station
at the other end as there is in an ordinary
television circuit

  this instrument acts like a search-
light replied the professor laughing
triumphantly a searchlight that both
sees and hears and shines through opaque
walls and is absolutely unaffected by dis-
tance by a swing of this controller i
can send this searchray to any point onthe
face of the earth and bring that point
instantly on the screen

  the transmitter and receiver are both
in this building you can see part of the
mechanism on the roof

  from the balcony to which he led them
he pointed out a huge network on the
roof priestley and slade were unable to
follow the technical explanation which
the professor then gave

  as they entered the laboratory again
wrenn introduced his friend and priest-
ley anxious to save his remaining precious
time poured out at once his confidence in
the new invention and his willingness to
finance the company he took care not to
suggest that he would have to borrow
money to do so

  the inventor listened patiently there
was on his face the look that one would
give a child who was laboring under a
delusion

  i am sorry mr priestley he said
when tom had finished i thought i could
use you when your friend wrenn sug-
gested it i went to see your attorneys
about it this afternoon understanding that
they managed your estate for you mr
van dusen head of the firm is an old
friend of mine and perhaps told me more
than he should about your affairs i
wouldnt mention it now were it not for
your extraordinary offer perhaps though
you did not get the letter he was sending
you when i was there i understand that
owing to complications connected with
your grandfathers will your estate is in no
shape to invest in anything i am glad to
have met you however and i hope you
will get on your feet again

  he turned again to his instrument

  tom priestley sank into a chair lost
in despairing thought

chapter iv

distance annihilated

et us try an opaque wall said the
professor take this field-glass and
examine the windows of that yonkers
hotel pick out one with a light in it so
that you can identify it and then look at
the screen


famous fantastic mysteries

  the field-glass was passed around the
balcony and after a little the company
agreed on a window and indicated it to
the professor through the glasses the
company could catch through half-drawn
curtains faint glimpses of a company
within

  turning to the screen they gave a start
of surprise to find that they had suddenly
been hitched onto the apartment in ques-
tion and were listening to some merry
banter around a little group of young
people holding a new years eve party
the wonderful ray had not only prac-
tically transported them a half mile up
the street but had faced them about so
they were actually on the screen looking
across the strange apartment and out of
the window that they faced

  i am independent of direction also
said the professor turning the controller

  in an instant the strange apartment
was reversed on the screen and they were
facing persons who had their backs to
them a moment before another turn of
the controller and the room seemed to spin
around like a top

  you see said the professor i have
done away with the need of a transmitting
station at the other end of the line the
thing that has hitherto limited the use of
television

  then the bewildered audience for the
next few minutes entered uninvited and
unseen guests company after company of
new years revelers suddenly the com-
pany found themselves facing an unfami-
liar street it was in a big city and was
likewise filled with holiday celebraters
but no new yorker recognized it

  michigan avenue chicago shouted
a gentlemen suddenly my own home is a
block away let me see how the servants
are behaving theyve been alone in the
house for a week its no 

  at the word the street slid along the
screen and stopped when a handsome
marble portico in the middle of the screen
bore on its surface the number  then
the door seemed to shift toward them and
suddenly melt away and the watchers in

the laboratory found themselves moving
through a huge old-fashioned hall of the
style that came into vogue about the
middle of the twentieth century

  at the farther end another door faded
away and as the room beyond moved onto
the screen the watchers heard distant
sounds as of wild revelry the house-holder
stirred uneasily through two more rooms
they passed then the sounds came from
below

  a shift of the professors controlling
lever and they dropped through the floor
and were in the midst of a wild scene

  it was the servants hall holding some
twenty young men and women some of
whom the chicago man recognized as his
own servants and all much the worse for
liberal use of his own rare old wine

  the girls of the party were decked out
in rich finery of a style and taste hardly
within reach of the servant class so per-
fect was the work of professor fleckners
machine that the shouting and singing
of the revelers seemed to be in the
laboratory and the watchers who sought
to comment to each other on the scene
before them could not make themselves
heard

  the chicago man was beside himself
he rushed up to the screen as though he
thought for a moment he could rush on the
scene and stop the despoiling of his wine-
cellar

  at length in a temporary lull in the
racket he shouted to the inventor

  cant this business be stopped in some
way can we telephone the chicago police
from here they are drinking up all my
old wine and those girls have on my wifes
best dresses and those drunken fools will
set the house afire its an old-fashioned
building and not perfectly fireproof tell
me where the phone booth is please and
ill call the police and send them around
there ill take the next monorail for
chicago

  the professor switched off the noisy
crew for a moment so that he could talk
to the excited man

  hold on my friend he said i can
on the brink of 



fix things without any trouble i will show
you another and still more wonderful
phase of this invention that i had intended
to bring out in another way but as long
as we stumbled onto this impromptu
party i might as well have you attend
it in person as well as in the role of an
invisible spectator

  fleckner turned then to his switch-
noard tightened up a few screws and
threw over two switches

  now he said when the  machine
sioes to work again every one in front of
this screen will be projected out like a
perfect life-size mirage at the end of this
ray in other words this gentleman here
can to all appearance stand in the midst
of his reveling servants and address them
face to face as though he had dropped
from the ceiling

  his listeners gasped in astonishment
they would have to see this demonstrated
before they would believe it unreservedly

  now if you mr chicago man and
you and you and you the inventor went
on pointing to three others of the most
husky men in the company will just
stand in front of this screen and be ready
to act just as though you were in that
room we will give these people a scare
that will sober them in a hurry and stop
this watch-night performance some time
before the glad new year dawns

  the men did as requested the professor
threw on another switch to the astonished
eyes of the company the room in chicago
this time seemed to stand out from the
screen and embrace the men in front of
it who to all appearances were now a
part of the company of revelers

to the startled four thus transported
the miracle was all the more realistic
their companions in the laboratory
seemed to have been blotted out and they
found themselves face to face with the
drunken servants

  suddenly there was a silence among the
merry crowd some one had seen the un-
expected guests one servant recognteed
the master every one was speechless

  then the householder recovered from
his own surprise at this sudden shift and
found his voice

  so this is the way i can trust you
people is it he demanded in thunder-
ous tones that were evidently heard by
the servants for they visibly winced
you people who dont belong here go out
that door to the street and if there is one
of you in this precinct five minutes from
now you will be sent up for burglary for
i am going to phone the police at once

  the rest of you go to your rooms
take off the clothes that dont belong to
you pack your own belongings and go
also dont let that take more than five
minutes either dont let me ever see any
of you again

  the revelers rose as one very sobered
man and in less than five minutes the
directions of the householder had been
obeyed

  the figure of the latter directed by the
professors skillful manipulations followed
the butler about to the last and saw that
he had locked all the doors the only slip
in the realism came when the man sur-
rendered the keys to his master and they
fell right through a shadow hand and
jingled on the stones of the areaway

  the butler was too troubled however
to notice it was anything more than a bit
of carelessness and the next minute had
slunk away then the professor turned off
the ray and the four found themselves
back in the laboratory standing in front
of the screen

  as this little byplay closed tom priest-
ley rushed to the front of the room in
intense excitement he had been watching
proceedings with growing interest

  when chicago was thrown on the screen
he suddenly remembered that one of those
three cousins he had so desired to see
that they might sign his fortune back to
him lived in chicago then he had
watched the astonishing demonstration of
transference that followed with a sudden
resolution

  as it closed he looked at his watch it
lacked still two hours of midnight why


famous fantastic mysteries

could he not be transported in figure to
chicago hunt up his cousin and get his
signature

  professor fleckner he shouted to the
startled inventor as he rushed to the front
of the room in a frenzy he forgot for
the time being the presence of the rest
of the company could i by this means
go to a man in chicago and get him to
sign a paper that would hold in law
he demanded

  certainly mr priestley was the
reply it can be witnessed at this end
also by mr brewster whom you have met
this evening and who is a notary public
this instrument will at the same time re-
produce here an exact copy of the docu-
ment with notarys signature

  that involves no new principle we
have had the chirotelegraph in practical
use for fifty years you know one of the
first legal decisions after business men
began to sign checks by wire in new york
and have them reproduced by the instru-
ment in chicago was that when properly
witnessed the reproduction of a signature
by that means was the same in law as the
original writing under the writers hand
in fact that it was an original so any
paper signed tonight in chicago and re-
produced at that instant by my instrument
and witnessed here by a notary would be
legal am i not right mr brewster he
added appealing to the lawyer he had
just mentioned

  perfectly right professor was the
reply

  professor fleckner went on priestley
excitedly you offer me a forlorn hope
as perhaps you know from your conversa-
tion with my counsel today my fortune
reverts to the government at midnight un-
less i can before then get three remaining
relatives to sign away their claim under
my grandfathers will i have just two
hours left if you will save that fortune
for me i will not merely invest in your
company to float this wonderful invention
but i will give to you personally one
million dollars and think it a cheap
price 

chapter v

   a chase for twenty million

for a moment there was dead silence
in the little room then followed a
hum of excitement every one there knew
the heir of the priestley millions by repu-
tation at least though not as rich as
some of the young multimillionaires he
was recognized as one of the leaders of
the smart set and a representative of that
element of established wealth too firmly
entrenched to be disturbed by the class
war so long brewing

  now to learn from his own lips that
this great fortune was to disappear in a
night and disappear to further the very
cause of which the priestleys had been
such conspicuous opponents this was in-
deed theme for excitement

  while this little buzz of gossip was going
on in the room tom was explaining to
the professor in low tones the details of
his grandfathers will and the informa-
tion he had just received regarding his
unknown cousins the company quieted
down again after a moment and watched
eagerly for the next move in this extraor-
dinary new years eve game

  we have just two hours to midnight
the inventor said at last in that time we
must locate three unkjnown people who may
be scattered anywhere over the face of the
earth first we must see mr warner van
dusen attorney for mr priestley and
learn if he has any further information
regarding these missing heirs i will ask
you all to watch intently and be ready to
act as witnesses of all that follows close
watching will be needed as we must move
quickly there is no time to lose

  the professor turned on the magic ray
and began the most remarkable search
the world had ever known what follows
this point in our story takes much more
time to tell that it did for the actual
occurrence

  bear in mind that distance had been
annihilated and the actors in this unique
drama were transported from scene to
scene instantly the mere telling of those
on the brink of 



moves in the fewest possible words re-
quires time

  the scene on the screen now was the
library of mr warner van dusen tom
had been there many times on business
connected with his estate and recognized
it at once

  reading by the table sat mr van
dusen himself the company in the
laboratory were as yet invisible for the
professor had not turned on the projector

  i thought i would find him in and
alone remarked the inventor he is an
old bachelor and seldom mingles in
society even on new years eve i have
told him of my invention but he hasnt
seen a demonstration as yet so i wont
startle him too much

  the professor knocked on the table
beside him and the sound was reproduced
in the apartment on the screen

  come in said the lawyer supposing
it a knock on his own door

  the professor turned on the projector
and spoke from just without the lawyers
door

  this is professor fleckner he said
dont be startled i am not here in per-
son but am projecting my image so that
i can have a talk with you

  then the professor and priestley whom
he had called to his side stepped through
the closed door into the presence of the
lawyer who despite his warning nearly
fell off his chair in surprise

  mr van dusen began the professor
without waiting for the lawyer to recover
his equanimity i am going to save the
fortune of this young gentleman before
midnight by means of this invention if you
will give us some more details as to the
whereabouts of those missing heirs we
have no time to lose

  fleckner you are going to give me
heart-disease some day said van dusen
well as to those heirs let me see i
followed the case closely and can tell you
from memory all our meager data that
counts

  we only learned of them today
through a friend of that branch of the

family two years ago horace fair-
weather a worthless sort of specimen i
fear lived with his wife at no  dear-
born street chicago may not be there
now mrs foy a widow moved to bridle-
ville a little town in southern ohio ten
years ago informant hadnt heard from
her since

  george fairweather a soldier of for-
tune was an engineer surveying for the
monorail on the rocky mountain sec-
tion three years ago but lost his job
and disappeared thats all i-

  thanks goodby snapped the in-
ventor and without further formalities
faded from the astonished lawyers sight

  that same instant the company found
itself apparently out on a strange street

  dearborn street whispered the chi-
cago man

rapidly the house-fronts slid by on
the screen till on a tenement-door
they saw the number  the professor
and priestley were so focused that their
images were projected on the scenes ex-
plored by the wonderful ray the control-
ling switchboard was just outside the
range of vision the rest of the company
were visible spectators

  the two men in image entered the hall-
way of no  and examined the name-
plates no name like fairweather ap-
peared priestleys heart sank

  then that surprised organ jumped as
its owner found himself apparently stand-
ing in the areaway below and the pro-
fessors blows on the table at his elbow
seemed to be delivered on the dingy door
that was projected on the screen

  in a moment they heard a shuffling step
and the door opened a man appeared
evidently the janitor

  does any one by the name of horace
fairweather live here asked fleckner
or did any such person  r live here

  never heard of him snapped the
janitor and slammed the door

  cheer up said the professor well
interview the other tenants

  instantly they were in front of tht


famous fantastic mysteries

first apartment a rap brought an ill-
favored woman to the door she had never
heard of fairweather so it went all the
way up the building

  at length as they were about to turn
in despair from the last flat where a gar-
rulous man in tattered coat was trying
vainly to recall who held his flat before
him the fellow suddenly brightened up
and exclaimed

  why yes fairweather you say
that was the name jake shultz what
keeps the saloon on the next corner below
right-hand side told me the other day he
had seen that man he-

  thanks came instantly from the
professor whereupon he and priestley
found themselves outside and dearborn
street was flashing by again what kind of
an impression this sudden vanishing made
on their informant of the flat they had
no means of knowing

  while tom was speculating on the pos-
sibility of reading next morning about
several sudden deaths from fright in chi-
cago he found himself and the professor
standing in front of a bar presided over by
a porcine-looking german the man was
plainly startled and those around the bar
near them were staring at the intruders
with hostile looks

  say you said the proprietor glower-
ing at them pe you fellers gum-shoes
i titnt hear you come in yet vy you
schnooping round so sthill

  fly cops growled a man at the pro-
fessors elbow we never seen nor heard
em come in did we boys

  no came an unfriendly chorus

  the professor looked a bit helpless
then priestley jumped into the breach
with his superior worldly knowledge he
pulled a ten-dollar bill from his pocket
with a wink at the professor

  drinks all around he said we
simply came to ask mr schultz after a
man we used to know

  the crowd visibly mellowed but the
hostile look was not altogether dissipated
three of the ugliest-looking customers in
the crowd had edged around between the

visitors and the door priestley smiled
when he thought of the surprise to follow
whenthe professor and himself were ready
to remove their images

  the old saloon-keeper glanced at the
bill in toms hand and at length turned
to draw the drinks first casting a mean
ing look around the company of his regu-
lar customers

  what we want to know whispered
tom confidentially to the saloon-keeper
is where we can find horace fairweather
who used to live at no  top floor

  the others had crowded in closely and
despite toms precautions overheard hi
request

  fly cops again came the murmui
from the crowd kill eml

  tom amused at the futility of such h
suggestion turned a smiling fearless fact
on the angry company

  that enraged them the more

  kill em came the cry again look
out fer gunsl

  wait roared a big ugly man waving
the others back what ye want o fair
weather he demanded

  are you horace fairweather asked
tom hopefully

  i roared the stranger brandishing
a big fist in toms face do i look like
a pale one-eyed runt of a second-story
man

  the mans anger was so evident that
tom took this description to be a real
characterization of his beloved cousin

  kill em again came the cry

  a man at toms elbow aimed a blow at
the young mans head that would have
floored priestley in the flesh as it was
tom instinctively dodged

  the fellows fist shot impotent through
the image of toms head and the deliverer
of the blow nearly lost his balance he
staggered over against the bar and looked
at the smiling young man in amazement

  talk about dodging he panted
slick aint ye

  at that instant another thug swung one
of the heavy cafe chairs over his head
and brought it down on the image of
on the brink of 



professor fleckner it went through that
apparently solid body and crashed to the
floor

  at the same time the professor taken
by surprise also dodged and in doing so
stepped out of the range of his projector
to the thunder-struck onlookers he seemed
to fade away in thin air

  the crowd staggered back paralyzed
with astonishment among them stood
tom smiling and serene an inspiration
seized him

  you thought you were dealing with
ordinary men didnt you he sneered
you can no more hurt us than you can
the winds of heaven now he added
fiercely turning to the man who so vehe-
mently denied being horace fairweather
if you know when you are well off tell
me what i want to know about fair-
weather and tell me quick

  the trembling wretch twice opened his
mouth to speak but his breath each time
failed him then the door opened behind
them and a harmless unsuspecting seeker
of liquid refreshment entered

  that broke the spell the way was clear
to the crowded street with a howl the
man nearest the door bolted through it
the others followed the next moment the
image of tom priestley stood alone in
the deserted bar

chapter vi

a trail of crime

in the excitement of this bizarre adven-
ture tom for the moment forgot his
real quest he was brought to his senses
by the voice of the professor

  we must follow that man said the
inventor and force him to explain his
clue

  as he spoke he turned the street on the
screen and worked it rapidly back and
forth before them for some minutes they
searched but nowhere could they discover
the big man who had admitted knowing
horace fairweather he had sought shelter
in one of the other dives in his panic of
fear and in that beehive section they
might search for him an hour in vain even
with the facility afforded by the wonder-
ful ray

  for five minutes the inventor worked his
controlling switch rapidly suddenly the
chicago man jumped up and rushed to
the professors side

  by jovel he cried i believe i saw
fairweather if that fellows description
was accurate there was one little pale-
faced chap with only one eye in the crowd
punishing my wine he didnt seem as
drunk as the rest and was the first to
sneak away of course its only a chance

doming next month-

famous fantastic mysteries

but we might find him in that neighbor-
hood still he has only had fifteen minutes
to get away in

  well try it as a forlorn hope decided
the professor instantly

  for the next few minutes he worked
rapidly passing in panorama all the sec-
tions of street about the michigan avenue
house where the servants had been hold-
ing revel examining the face of every
person every car leading away from the
scene was also scrutinized

  nowhere however could they sight a
small pale one-eyed man again the pro-
fessor swept the scene going through street
after street all in vain precious time had
passed

  professor fleckner turned off the ray
for a moment and heaved a sigh of
despair he was thinking of that million-
dollar reward

  im afraid its no use he muttered
only an hour and a half left and none
of the three found

  priestley sank to his chair resigned to
his fate

  would you mind looking at my house
again asked the chicago man as long
as youve given this other thing up im
worried a little about it especially as i
left those keys in the areaway

  go ahead said tom in answer to an
inquiring look from the inventor dont
mind me any more theres nothing to
be done

  professor fleckner turned on the ray
once more this time without the projector
and a moment later they were looking at
the areaway of the chicago mans house
minutely they examined the tilings the
bunch of keys had disappeared

  the house-owner jumped to his feet
with a cry of distress

  theyve come back and broken in
he exclaimed quick stop them

  instantly the interior of the house was
thrown on the screen and passed rapidly
before the watchers room by room on
the second floor in front of a closed door
crouched two figures one holding a dark
lantern

  in one could be recognized the butler
whom the company had seen so sum-
marily dismissed less than half an houi
before he was holding the lantern and
directing his companion who was working
at the keyhole with a skeleton-key

  sure he always sleeps in this room
the butler was saying dont you bungle
the job put him out o business so
thorough hell never discharge no more
butlers well get enough out o here
too so ill never buttle for anybody again
ill ave that little bar in a month from
now wot a fool i was to work honest
for that man all these years

  be still you drunken fool ordered
the man at the keyhole

  priestley caught one look at this fellows
face and jumped to his feet exultant

  it was the thin one-eyed man they
had caught their quarry unexpectedly

  the professor left the instrument for an
instant stepping into the next room he
returned with two pairs of heavy maga-
zine pistols

  giving two to tom who was nearest
and taking two himself he put priestley
in position at one side of the crouching
figures on the screen and took up a place
on the other side himself

  be ready to act as though you were
on the spot he directed ill turn on
the projector and well get them

  just a moment professor said mr
brewster the lawyer coming forward
this man with the key is evidently the
horace fairweather you want let me
warn you now that any signature you
get from him through fright or threat
will be worthless so be very diplomatic
if it werent for the necessary speed i
would advise waiting till you could see
him under circumstances not so com-
promising

  heres an idea why not make a noise
in another part of the house and scare
them out then a moment later you
can meet them on the street and there
will be no appearance of knowing any-
thing that will make this man act with-
out his free will
on the brink of 

  the professor saw the point he and
priestley stepped back again fleckner
moved to the other side of the labora-
tory and made on the rug the sound of a
heavy muffled tread the two figures in
the chicago house over a thousand miles
away sprang to their feet in alarm

  some one downstairs whispered the
butler in terror

  this way replied the other the
fire-escape is in the rear and we can get
through to the other street

  the professors search-ray followed
the men to the back of the house down
the fire-escape over the fence to the next
street where the two crouched behind a
low wall and waited till the policeman
who was passing at the moment should
get safely by

  well make sure of catching these
scoundrels after we get what we want
said the professor put your pistols in
your pockets but be ready to draw them
he added to tom who obeyed the pro-
fessor setting the example

  then the latter turned on the projector
and the images of himself and tom ap-
peared on the sidewalk a little way behind
the officer

  moving swiftly to his side the pro-
fessor accosted him the policeman
stopped startled

  ah pardon me gentlemen he ex-
claimed you came up so quietly i was
taken back for a second

  we have our eye on some men you
want the professor explained they are
behind the wall two doors below waiting
for you to pass we found them robbing
a house over in the avenue now we
particularly wish to see one of them whom
we know before you alarm him because
by a strange coincidence he is a relative
of this gentleman who wants him to sign
some papers before there is any appear-
ance of compulsion well explain more
fully afterward all we ask now is that
you stand by and see that there is no
foul play and arrest the man after we are
through with him	-

  this is indeed strange business gen-

tlemen said the officer suspiciously
who is this relative of yours sir

  his name is horace fairweather re-
plied tom he-

  horace fairweather exclaimed the
officer alive with excitement not
bruiser horace a big black-complex-
ioned brute with a scar across his fore-
head weve been after him for months

chapter vii

a grim ally

now it was the turn of the others to
be excited and at the same time
crestfallen

  tom and the professor looked at each
other in dismay this was the exact de-
scription of the man they had seen in the
saloon who had so vehemently denied
being fairweather he had eluded them
by a clever trick

  no said tom at last i guess we
are on the wrong track the man we
thought was fairweather is a little pale
fellow with one eye

  sneaker tim exclaimed the police-
man a catch almost as good hes a
pal of horaces and if we catch him
maybe we can worm out the whereabouts
of the other

  here exclaimed tom excitedly
we know a roundabout way to get be-
hind these fellows through these prem-
ises you walk along as though nothing
had happened when you are opposite
the third gateway from here well be be-
hind the wall with our pistols to the
backs of the men you want well
whistle you shove your pistol right over
the wall and well have our birds cor-
nered

  this extraordinary affair plainly non-
plused the officer he hesitated a mo-
ment only however toms determined
tone had its effect

  as a rule id say you people were
crooks trying a new game on me he re-
marked frankly with a laugh but you
look too honest and anyhow ill try and
see what the game is


famous fantastic mysteries

  he turned and started down the street
as bidden and the next instant the images
of tom and fleckner had been transferred
to the yard where the crooks were hiding
and the images of magazine-pistols were
pressed to the backs of the real men
then the helmet of the officer appeared in
the street

  tom gave a low whistle there was a
cry and a brief struggle and the next mo-
ment the butler and sneaker tim stood
handcuffed before the officer and beside
them were the triumphant shadows of
tom and the professor

  at their backs these two shadow-actors
could hear the suppressed excited whis-
pers of the little company who were watch-
ing this new years eve drama in the
laboratory which except for these occa-
sional whispers tom in his excitement
had quite forgotten it was hard to real-
ize he was not really in chicago at the
moment

  but he now pulled himself into his
shadow part again and in a few words
told the officer who he was and why it was
so necessary to get at his cousin at once

  he took care not to explain that he was
really over a thousand miles away the
wonderful invention was kept out of the
explanation altogether and the officer
supposed he was talking to real men

  when he had finished the policeman
turned to the prisoners

  you he said to the butler will go
to the station with me you sneaker
tim have a chance at saving your hide
again ill take the law in my hands this
once this gentleman must see bruiser
horace at once and get him to sign a
paper if he does hell pay you both
well and ill see that you both have a
chance to get out of the city if he
doesnt you at least go up and you know
that means a life sentence this time

  these gentlemen have heavy guns
with them you will get on the car with
them at the corner and take them direct
to horaces hiding-place ill ring up a
plainclothes friend of mine on the quiet
and hell follow to see you dont get
away youll coax fairweather to sign

this paper and itll all be done in fifteen

minutes not a word now be off

  the evil shifting eyes of the prisoner
went from one face to the other for an
instant then fell

  all right gents he said you got
me where you want me lead on

  a few minutes later the three entered
a dark tenement-house and proceeded up
an old-fashioned elevator to the top floor
twenty stories high at the rear apart-
ment tom knocked

  well stay outside said the professor
call us if you want us

  he and tom then seemed to step back
into the darkness of the hallway in
reality the professor turned off the pro-
jector at this point and by means of the
invisible ray they followed tim into the
dark little apartment into which he was
admitted by a pale slovenly woman

  in the back room she said listlessly
and tim went through a blind door in the
back of a little closet and found there the
man whom tim and his fellow watchers
recognized as the one they had encoun-
tered first in the bar

  tim went right to the point told his
pal in a few words what had happened
of his meeting with tom priestley and the
request that he sign the paper that would
keep the fortune in the family then
fairweather broke loose

  see here he said or rather roared
my father left me and the other two
only one thing-a hate for the rich end
of the priestley family that nothing can
kill we all three swore before he died
wed never sign any papers to keep the
fortune for the descendants of the man
that cast us off well die before well do
it no not if you rot in prison tim and
i hope you do for being a cowardly
squealer

  he stopped a moment and a look of
fierce suspicion came over his face that
made his companion quail before him

  how did you get here without being
watched he demanded seizing the
smaller man by the shoulder i believe
you let em shadow you you dirty little
pup youve got us both in a hole youll
on the brink of 



never serve another day in prison you
infernal whelp

  there was a gasp as the big mans
fingers closed around the little mans
throat the hand of sneaker tim shot
into his pocket it came out again with
a deadly magazine pistol

  fairweather saw it too late there was
a flash in the dim room the two fell to
the floor together behind them was a
shriek of terror and fury there was a
flash and a long knife in the hand of the
thin woman sank into the back of
sneaker tim

  the pals had served their last prison
sentence

  one of the three priestley heirs had
been removed a grim ally had come to
the aid of the family fortune

chapter viii

the depths of madness

priestley roused himself with a
shudder professor fleckner had
turned off the ray and blotted out the
scene of tragedy he saw only the little
laboratory and its new years eve com-
pany about him

  on the faces of all was a fixed breath-
less horror it was as though they had
suddenly awakened from a terrible night-
mare then from about the room rose
a stir and a sigh of relief-the kind that
comes to an awakening sleeper when he
realizes that after all it was only a dream

  and so it was to these watchers of a
violent death over a thousand miles away
as soon as it dawned on them that they
were not really in the dread presence the
reality slipped from their imaginations
and it became merely as a vivid tale
lately read

  not so with tom priestley his was a
keen sensibility and vivid imagination
the horror still lived before him

  he felt that just behind that screen
still lay those two lifeless forms and above
them the shrieking woman holding poiged
the dripping knife tom shuddered and
closed his eyes

  suddenly he jumped up this was no
vision two real human beings had been
blotted out another had just com-
mitted an awful act distance to him
was nothing they were still within in-
stant reach

  he had a duty to perform the police
must be summoned and the doctor called
he turned to the inventor

  that worthy showed in his immobile
face no trace of feeling in connection with
the recent horror he was hurrying over
the pages of a gazetteer that lay on the
table beside him

  quick shouted tom back to chi-
cago one of those men may still be
alive we must get a doctor and summon
the authorities

  the professor turned to him a cold face
and his hand sought the levers of his
instrument

  we have no time to worry about the
dead he answered we have two more
of the living to seek and twenty million
real dollars to save one of the heirs is
forever out of the reckoning i exam-
ined closely before i turned off the ray
his pals bullet went through his heart
we have only three-quarters of an hour
left in which to search the world for the
others i am now getting bridleville
ohio where i trust we shall find mrs
samuel foy

  fierce anger gripped priestley to his
highly idealistic mind the professors con-
duct and words seemed the height of the
sordid that the man should neglect
suffering humanity to save mere dollars
was to tom inconceivable it was the mil-
lion promised the professor that had in-
spired his unholy zeal

  tom dashed forward hardly knowing
what he intended to do but instinctively
bent on returning to that chamber of
death where he felt his duty lay he was
caught by the shoulder and forced back
into his chair

  be still tom said a voice over him

  tom looked up into the face of his old
chum slade

  dont be a fool tom continued


famous fantastic mysteries

slade you have too much at stake

  in the eyes of his old friend tom saw
also the motive inspired by the promises
of another sordid million the man who
a little while before had congratulated
him on losing his fortune now that he
had a personal interest in it was ready
to desert for it his suffering fellow men
for whom he had always professed such
zeal

  tom closed his eyes in sick disgust
and took no further interest in what went
on about him

  meanwhile the professor was rapidly
manipulating his little levers on the
screen before them went flashing by a
long stretch of country off across the
snow-covered landscape were spread
broad beautiful estates

  the moonlight gleamed on their white
lawns gables and turrets and broad ex-
panses of green-houses in which the rich
kept their famous winter gardens of the
temperate zone alternated with these
estates were the broad parks in the midst
of whose leafless trees shone the light of
hundreds of suburban cottages

  all this sped by in an instant of time
they were following one of the great
monorail trunk lines four big bands
of glistening steel with their guide-rails
overhead were sliding past the watchers
now and then with a flash and roar a
train of big palace-cars each the size of
an early-century yacht would speed by

  suddenly the moving panorama stopped
they were at a railroad station and
around it was spread out one of the few
remaining old-fashioned villages a hun-
dred or so houses irregularly lining the
half-lighted streets

  the towerman bending tensely over his
levers and the night operator half asleep
over the clicking instruments in the little
station were the only living persons
around through the still air came the
sound of voices and laughter where in all
probability the socially elect of the village
were holding a new years eve meeting

  the professor turned an inquiring look
at priestley that young man was slouch-

ing back in his chair sullenly indifferent
fleckner saw he could hope for no help
from him so again putting on the hat
and coat he had been wearing when pro-
jecting himself to outdoor scenes he
swung the projector on himself and his
image stepped onto the station platform
in bridleville

  the next moment he stood over the
drowsy form of the operator instinc-
tively he reached out a shadow-hand and
touched the slumberous one on the
shoulder then he laughed to himself
as he realized that he had no flesh and
blood available out in ohio

  he resorted again to the expedient of
stamping on the floor in his new york
city laboratory the sound at once
awoke the operator

  pardon me for disturbing you said
the professor politely but can you tell
me where i can find the home of mrs
samuel foy

  the young man started visibly as
though the professors apparently inno-
cent question had stung him

  for a full minute he looked over his
visitor with cold suspicion

  what do you want of mrs samuel
foy he demanded in a sullen tone

  i merely wished to learn from you
where i might find her replied the pro-
fessor with some dignity if you are
unwilling to tell me all right

  i dont know anything about her
said the operator with finality i dont
think youll find anybody around here
who does either

  without further parley fleckner with-
drew his image and as soon as he was out-
side the station flashed about the village
in search of some more willing informant

  the next instant he saw coming toward
his projection an individual of unsteady
gait he was evidently a new year
reveler who had reveled too enthusias-
tically for a country village and had been
left to complete the festivities of the oc-
casion by himself

  not a very promising outlook thought
the inventor but worth trying
on the brink of 



 he stopped in front of the man and
vas greeted with the utmost enthusiasm

 can you tell me where mrs samuel
foy lives asked fleckner

 the man swayed back and forth un-
teadily and then reaching out placed or
ought to place a supporting hand on the
inquirers shoulder the hand passed
hrough the professors immaterial bod
md dropped by the side of the inebriated
ne he started violently then pulled
limself together

  schuse me shir he apologized my
nistake cant calculate dishtances very
ood in moonlight never could from
oy schuse me sir

  once more he reached out this time
vith the utmost deliberation and calcula-
ion but the professor not wishing to
arry this test too far side-stepped and
he man finally found his needed support
n a lamp-post only two feet away

  tell you what he said in a confiden-
tial whisper after a moment more of
waying i aint supposed to know but
 drove horse fer doc pierce till he fired
me said id get even with him i heard
hat name before mrs samuel foy mrs
samuel foy dont nobody know round
iere ask doc pierce he knows but
dont tell him i said so hed kill me

  having thus delivered himself the ine-
jriated one meditated a moment then
slid quietly down the lamp-post and went
o sleep on the icy curb

  hell freeze poor man  whispered a
womans voice from the back of the lab-
oratory

  but the professor busied with his lev-
ers paid no heed

  now the screen showed the front of the
lighted house in bridleville from which
ame the sounds of mirth professor
fleckners figure stood on the steps a
few raps by the real fleckner on his lab-
oratory table brought a young woman to
the door

  pardon me for disturbing you said
the caller urbanely but could you tell
me where i can find dr pierce

  he lives at the end of the street but

he is here this evening answered the
young woman wait a moment please
and ill call him wont you come in
thanks no replied fleckner ill
stand right here i only want him a mo-
ment

  a few minutes later in response to the
young womans call a jovial person ap-
peared and stepped out on the porch

  i am dr pierce he announced
what can i do for you

  the professor had heard enough in the
last ten minutes to be convinced that
strategy was necessary

  i am an old friend of mrs samuel
foy he said and being in town over
night wished to call on her in the morn-
ing before leaving on an early forenoon
train can you tell me please where i
may find her and if she is well enough
to receive callers

  at the mention of mrs foys name the
doctors urbane expression vanished he
glared searchingly at his caller for a full
minute

  then he seemed to recover himself and
said hastily

  i am sorry sir it will be impossible
to see mrs foy i am obliged to keep
the unfortunate woman in the utmost
seclusion it will be no satisfaction to
see her mrs foy has been a hopeless
maniac for over ten years

chapter ix

a plot unearthed

vt ow professor fleckner said
priestley starting up that ends
our search if this unhappy woman is
insane she can sign no valid paper and
there is no use of continuing i thank
you for your effort now however we
have a human duty-the one i urged
upon you before please return to chi-
cago and see if we can do anything for
the men we left apparently dead and that
poor woman who was so unfortunately
mixed up in the tragedy

  not so fast not so fast my young
friend rejoined the professor one of


famous fantastic mysteries

the secrets of my success is that i never
give up i must see this alleged crazy
woman there is something under the
surface in this strange case

  while he was speaking professor
fleckner was rapidly moving his levers
and priestley despairing of gaining his
point now realized that there was a series
of private rooms being thrown on the
screen the inventor was examining each
house in the little settlement at lightning
speed

  no secret chamber could withstand his
penetrating ray it was clear to the
watchers that if this great invention came
into general use and was not in some way
curtailed in its action personal privacy
would become a thing of the past

  a moment later the professor stopped
with a sigh every house in the village
had been searched there was no one
revealed that in any way suggested a mad
woman

  then still undaunted he went at his
levers again this time he threw on the
screen a birds-eye view of the town then
was discovered what the manipulator of
levers had before overlooked - a low
dark-brick house out on the end of a side
street far back in a grove and shrouded
in darkness suggestive of deep mystery

  into this plunged the privacy-destroy-
ing ray room after room was laid bare
on the screen in one was a slumbering
woman in another lay two small chil-
dren asleep in a crib they were at

first the only living beings exposed by the
ray

  then suddenly a turn of the controlling
lever brought out a strange little apart-
ment it was in the top of the house
under the center of the roof the one
window was barred the heavy door was
double locked the furniture was meager
everything suggested a prison

  but what at once attracted the atten-
tion of the onlookers was a lone figure in
the center of the room that of a woman
neatly dressed in black a rather refined
woman of a little past middle age her
hair was snow-white and her face de-
noted long suffering yet the eyes
though wet with recent weeping were
clear and reasonable

  she sat her back to the door chin in
hand and elbow resting on the little table
looking far into the distance that could
be seen only with the eye of memory

  that cannot be the woman said one
of the watchers at priestleys elbow she
does not appear crazy

  priestley looked up and recognized
dr cyrus rumsey a nerve specialist
one of the guests to whom he had been
introduced that evening during the recess
in professor fleckners experiments

  professor fleckner said the doctor
leaning forward pardon my breaking in
but if you find the woman for whom
youre searching i may be able to tell
if she is crazy you seem to doubt the
bridleville doctors story

backache leg pains may be danger sign

 of tired kidneys-how to get happy relief

  if backache and leg pains are making you

  i do doubt his story replied fleck-
ler i think this is mrs foy a prisoner
md as sane as you or i

  the professor knocked on the table as
le spoke turning the projector so that
he sound was directed at the outside of
he barred door

 yes said the woman within in a
lear rational voice

 dont be alarmed i am a friend
this is mrs foys room is it now re-
jlied the professor

  yes this is mrs foy who are you
ame the reply

  i come from a relative of yours an-
swered the professor i have learned
something of your secret and have come
to help you i have some keys and am
coming in make no sound

 as the woman rose to face him her
eyes left the door for a moment in that
instant the professor rattled some keys
against the laboratory table making a
noise like unlocking and opening a door
as the woman turned he had projected
his image into the room and though a
little startled at the suddenness of his
appearance she did not notice the re-
markable method of his apparent en-
trance

  we must act quickly said the pro-
fessor have you stylograph and
paper

 the woman pointed to the articles
which lay with a letter-pad on the table

  your cousin thomas priestley heir to
all the family wealth has just learned of
your whereabouts and sent me to get you
to sign a release of the estate went on
the professor you may understand that
it reverts by your grandfathers will to
the united states government at midnight
tonight unless all the heirs sign off

  to the relief and surprise of the pro-
fessor and in fact of priestley-who was
interested again in spite of himself-the
woman grasped the stylograph eagerly

  nothing can give me greater pleas-
ure she said if you can only get me out
of this place for two years my step-son
who is the night telegraph-operator for

the monorail here has kept me prisoner
it is all a plot of horace fairweather
who if he is my brother is an arch devil
i suspect that thomas priestleys lawyers
in new york are in it too

  you see they discovered a previous
will of great-grandfather andrew priestley
leaving all the estate entailed to his oldest
daughter jane my grandmother to be
handed down to the oldest child in each
generation of her descendants then my
poor father maurice fairweather oldest
son of jane ran wild and grandfather cut
off our branch of the family making the
will that left the estate to his son and
sons heirs

  now it seems the old will was not de-
stroyed the lawyers and my brother
horace hoped to let the terms of the
present will lapse and the estate go to the
government then they would show that
great-grandfather made the second will
because he was deceived into thinking
my father was dead so they hope to
have the later will set aside and the orig-
inal will hold

  they have kept me prisoner giving out
that i am crazy so horace the next
younger than i can get control of the
fortune you have come in time to save
it all

  but no what am i thinking of
horace will not sign it i can do no good
and my other poor brother-no one knows
where he is you must have us all
dont fear said the professor coldly
your brother horace is dead and we
will get your other brothers signature to-
night we have him traced write what
i dictate at once and sign it i have no
time to lose tomorrow i will come back
and release you

  quickly overcoming the shock of this
brutal announcement which however
seemed to affect her little the woman took
the stylograph and wrote as follows at the
professors dictation

     i ada fairweather foy in full possession
   of my faculties and of my own free will do
   hereby release all claim that i now have or


famous fantastic mysteries

  hereafter may have on the estate of the
  late andrew priestley my great-grand-
  father	ada fairweather foy

  goodby mrs foy i will see you to-
morrow said the professor and as the
woman turned to lay aside the writing
materials he vanished

  in the laboratory in new york lay an
exact reproduction of the paper drawn
up in bridleville ohio and to it mr
brewster put his signature as notary

 how about that woman dr rum-
sey asked the professor a little anx-
iously of the nerve specialist

  perfectly sane answered the doctor
ill take my oath to that

chapter x

a mystery of the sea

not a moment did professor fleck-
ner waste for comment

  thirty minutes left till midnight he
remarked half to himself stepping over
to a book-shelf in the back of the room
from it he took a volume which he hur-
riedly consulted

  george harvey he murmured rush-
ing back thats the chief engineer of
the intercontinental monorail company
ive got to trace george fairweather our
third and last object of search our only
clue is that three years ago he was with
an engineering gang on this road

  frantically the professor grabbed the
street directory on the table and turned
to george harvey his business office
downtown was given the new york offices
of the monorail but his home was merely
chicago

  with a muffled exclamation of im-
patience the professor threw over his
levers and the next instant a chicago
street was again racing by on the screen
in a moment it paused at the sign of a
drug-store-

  then there was a waving image of the
interior of the store on the screen and
suddenly appeared a succession of magni-
fied pages of a chicago city directory

at har- the page shifting stopped
and the professor placed a triumphant
finger on the name of george harvey
with an address at no  micbigar
avenue

  without the delay of more than an in-
stant michigan avenue was flashed back
again and no  found then for a
moment the button of the door-bell ap-
peared on the screen magnified to huge
proportions

  it just occurred to me said the in-
ventor that i can ring a door-bell from
here just as well as not this ray of
course can transmit power currents of
any intensity i wish all i have to do is
to connect with the bell-wire and send a
weak charge through it and the bell
rings

  at that instant the door started to open
and the professor projected out his image
just in time to greet the butler

  is mr harvey in the professor
asked

  ill see sir your name was the
guarded response

  i am professor rufus fleckner said
the caller mr harvey will know who
i am

  pardon me but have you a card sir
was the next query

  that was a poser professor fleckner
had a card-case full of them but they
were material cards in his material pocket
in new york he had actually made a
semi-involuntary move to take out his
card-case before he remembered that
while he might show a shadow card to the
butler he could not make it material
enough so that the man might carry it in
to his employer

  im sorry he said but i left my
card-case at my hotel by accident i think
he will recognize me by my pictures if
he has never seen me

  very well sir said the butler and
disappeared

  he returned in a moment with right
this way sir

  the next moment the professor stood
on the brink of 



in the presence of a keen-eyed youngish
man who was plainly puzzled over this
visit at so late an hour by so noted a man
as professor fleckner

  this is a strange call i know said
the professor ignoring the cordially ex-
tended hand of his host for reasons ob-
vious to himself i happened to be call-
ing in the neighborhood tonight i am
anxious to locate a young friend of mine
who was recently a civil engineer some-
where in your employ and it occurred to
me as i was passing that you might be
the means of giving me the information i
want if you will give me the name and
address of the engineer in charge of the
construction of your rocky mountain
division i can trace the man i want
through him

  a pleasure to do yoy any favor in my
power i assure you replied the en-
gineer the man you want to communi-
cate with is christopher j zornow with
offices in the mortimer building san
francisco ill give you a note to him
or if you simply mention my name when
you write he will be glad to accommodate
you

  thank you i wont stop for a note
now i have to catch a train i trust i
can get what i want by telephone you
dont know mr zornows home address
do you added the professor rising

  no i dont

  good night and thank you again

  the visitor was gone before the sur-
prised host could rise to see him out

  that same instant a san francisco
drug-store was thrown on the screen and
the search-ray was going through the last
pages of a city directory there was no
such name as zornow in it

  back through the directory ran the ray
till it came to the mortimer building and
the next instant the directory-board of
that building was on the screen

  a glance told the professor that the office
of the division engineer of the monorail
was no  on the twenty-sixth floor a
twist of the lever and the inside of tkat
office was unfolded before them

  one of the ground-glass doors had mr
zornow printed on it in large black
letters immediately a row of letter-
flles within this room flashed into view
then as if a snow-storm of letters were
falling across the screen there flashed be-
fore the little audience an enlarged series
of the correspondence of mr zornow

  finally toward the end of the files
there appeared a letter to the engineer
addressed to a private residence in a
near-by suburb of the city a quick con-
sultation of the map of san francisco
and its vicinity on a universal chart at
the professors elbow gave him the loca-
tion of this place and the next instant
the professor in projected image was
ringing mr zornows door-bell

  luck again favored the searcher mr
zornow was in and still up thanks to it
being new years and in less than two
minutes had written down for the pro-
fessor a list of the ten section-foremen of
engineering gangs who covered his divi-
sion one of those might be able to tell
what had become of george fairweather

  then followed a rapid search of moun-
tain and valley for these ten men most
of them were in camps near small towns
in five minutes the professor had located
three of them and to each put the ques-
tion do you know george fair-
weather none of them did

  the fourth however who was found
in the bar of a little mountain resort
when he heard the query set his glass down
on the bar so suddenly that it broke then
he turned to the questioner a face of un-
feigned eagerness

  george fairweather he repeated i
should say i did he was a particular
friend of mine poor fellow have you
any news of him

  t have not said the professor i
came to get news where was he when
you heard of him last

  he sailed a month ago for manila on
the eastern princess replied the man
solemnly and if you read the papers you
know just as much about where he is now
as i do
so

famous fantastic mysteries

  the professor turned away with a ges-
ture of despair

  the eastern princess was one of the lat-
ter-day mysteries of the great deep a
month before she had sailed and had been
heard from regularly by wireless for two
days toward noon of the third day she
telegraphed that she had met a severe
storm and had been driven out of her
course

  in the midst of this message communi-
cation had suddenly ceased and had never
been resumed wireless rays had flashed
over seas in vain swift cruisers had tra-
versed every known route of the pacific
all in vain no trace of the ill-fated
ship was found

  fairweather the man they must find
now within fifteen minutes dead or alive
was lost somewhere on the boundless
pacific probably dead beneath its waves
but if so they must prove it and prove
it before midnight

chapter xi

scouring the pacific

only a moment did the resourceful
inventor hesitate

  well find the eastern princess he
said or prove before midnight that she
was lost and fairweather drowned

  as he spoke the professor turned the
chart over to the navigators map of the
pacific ocean and a swing of the con-
troller threw on the screen the heaving
waves of that great body of water

  following the main shipping route to
the philippines the inventor ran the
search-ray over the surface of the pacific
at lightning speed stopping long enough
at each ship he passed to make sure she
was not the eastern princess he was
watching closely for wreckage also but
none appeared

  then back he came sweeping the ocean
directly to the north of the route again
no results back once more to the south
he went till by repeated shifts he had
pretty thoroughly covered the north
pacific then he struck into the south

pacific and soon was far out of the range
of navigation

  suddenly a keen-eyed person in the
back of the room jumped up and shouted
stop there was something

  what was it asked the professor
checking the ray i saw nothing

go back a little way slowly please
the professor did so slowly covering
only about a hundred miles an hour till
presently the keen-eyed one shouted
here it is again

  the ray paused once more and sure
enough immediately in the center of the
screen lay on the slowly heaving water a
sea-chest the professor enlarged the
object till every detail stood out

  there on its surface in nearly effaced
letters could be seen the words steamer
eastern princess

  there had evidently been a wreck
something that with the improved navi-
gation facilities had not occurred before
in fifty years but what of those aboard
surely they must have escaped in the big
power life-boats with which the ship had
been equipped if george fairweather
was dead then he was also out of the
reckoning as far as the terms of the will
were concerned but by those very terms
it must be proved that he died before
midnight of that present night

  in ever-widening circles around the
little floating box the professor scoured
the ocean nothing else appeared wider
and wider the ray circled

  though it was a black moonless night
in this part of the world yet the won-
derful ray showed on the screen each patch
of water it touched as clearly as though
it were under the noonday sun the
properties of the ray were a perfect sub-
stitute for light

  but suddenly out of the rim of dark-
ness about the bright spot on the screen
gleamed a little point of light the pro-
fessor shifted the ray toward it and sud-
denly came upon a strange bit of land
an island about five miles in diameter

  there was a volcanic cone in its center
the whole bleak and barren except for a
on the brink of 



rim of tropical vegetation where the sea
had washed up a little fertile soil the
rest of the surface was rough volcanic
rock the little point of light gleamed
from a little cape half a mile from the
center of the rays focus

  the professor was about to turn the ray
directly on the point where this light
shone when as he shifted it a sight
caught his eye that made him pause

  on the shore of a little bay just within
the cape where the light shone was a col-
lection of tents improvised from sailcloth
all about was strewn wreckage within
the tents slept some hundred or more men
women and children

  a close examination of one of the sea-
chests revealed the truth they had
found the wreck of the eastern princess

  there remained by -the electric clock
on the wall of the laboratory just five
minutes till midnight

  the professor projected his own im-
age on the scene at this point tom now
keenly alive with interest jumped into
the circle also

  instinctively he drew his revolvers
from his pockets feeling that in such a
wild place unusual protection might be
needed they were advancing to one of
the tents when the faint sound of a
muffled oar-lock came to their ears only
a few feet away

  the nose of a boat gently grated the
sand the professor threw off the pro-
jector immediately and examined this new
phenomenon

  four long rowboats were being cau-
tiously beached from them emerged a
rnotely crew of cutthroats some were
evidently white men castaway sailors of
all nationalities but their rude skin cloth-
ing and long unkempt beards belied the
fact

  the others were of various hues hybrid
descendants of the savage tribes that once
inhabited the southern isles

  priestley remembered recent illustrated
newspaper articles about these people the
human derelicts of the sea they had
been slowly driven out of the frequented

islands till at last they had taken refuge
on a little group of new volcanic forma-
tions so far to the south of navigation
that they were left to riot among them-
selves as they saw fit

  it was on one of these islands evidently
that the eastern princess had been
wrecked in a storm which had driven her
out of her course

  now the survivors had been discov-
ered by their worse than savage neigh-
bors and were about to be massacred for
the unusual luxuries that a big steamer
would afford the marauders were armed
with rifles and spears there were few
signs of weapons about the improvised
camp of castaways

  wte must get that signature instantly
if fairweather is still with them before
those fellows get busy said the pro-
fessor grasping his levers

  signature cried priestley this is
too much good lord are you going to
let these fellows murder women and
children while we hunt for dollars

  in his eagerness tom grapsed the pro-
fessors arm the latter shook off the
young man and shifting the lever pro-
jected both their images into the tent
where lay the man who appeared to be
the captain of the lost vessel

  with a shout fleckner awoke him and
bending over asked

  is george fairweather with you
who are you demanded the drowsy
commander sitting up didnt you hear
me assign fairweather and jacobs to
guard the light tonight isnt he there
is anything wrong

  without stopping for reply the pro-
fessor whisked the images of himself and
tom over to the cape where the light
shone

  but as he did so he nearly fell back
over his laboratory table in surprise he
was looking into the shining barrel of one
of the heavy magazine pistols in toms
hand

  the young man was white with fury
the other pistol was covering the rest
of the company- who sat amazed


famous fantastic mysteries

  professor fleckner turn back instantly
and warn those people of the danger they
are in then you and the rest of you come
up here and put up as bold a front as
possible we will frighten those thugs
off even if we cant fight much from here
do you think i will stand by and see my
fortune saved when i might be rescuing
a hundred human beings from cut-
throats

  for a moment the professor faced his
fractious guest in sullen defiance

  one instant of delay and ill shoot
you like a dog professor fleckner 
fairly screamed tom

  the look in the young mans eye
warned the other that he meant it with-
out further delay he threw over the con-
trolling lever and motioned for the rest
of the company to come forward into the
range of the projector

  at that instant the electric clock on
the laboratory wall commenced to chime
twelve the year  had begun

chapter xii

a shot out of place

for an instant even in that moment
of supreme excitement tom listening
to the chiming of the clock realized that
it was striking the knell of the priestley
fortune but the next things began to
happen too fast for further thought

  the professor acting under the spur
of toms revolver had directed the im-
ages of all the men of the company to
the scene many of them were armed
tom appeared before the still half-awake
captain and in a word told him of his
peril in a moment the little camp was
alive

  there seemed to come to tom in this
crisis an instinctive knowledge of what
to do the little company of castaways
including the captain found themselves
obeying the directions of this strange
young man

  we arrived in a boat from ship off
shore just in time saw your lights was
the explanation tom made on the spur

of the moment to account for this sudden
appearance with a party of armed res-
cuers

  the attacking gang hearing a stir in
camp hesitated a little and in that res-
pite tom hustled the women and chil-
dren back out of immediate range of shots
and spread his men out in the darkness
some distance at each side of the camp
then the attacking party rushed the
place only to find their intended vic-
tims missing

  then toms forces began to pour in a
cross-fire that despite the darkness had
its effect cries here and there among
the enemy showed that shots had gone
home but now the thugs had recovered
from their surprise and began to retort
in kind unfortunately the shelter which
the darkness afforded was in a measure
balanced by the fact that the flash of the
pistols could be seen and these directed
the fire of the foe

  there was no sound of explosion of
course or smoke as in an old-fashioned
firearm but no one had yet discovered a
method of doing away with the flash of the
shot

  the shadow company at first discon-
certed the foe a little by dashing into their
midst with drawn pistols but as they could
not fire the pistols the assailants soon be-
gan to feel contempt for this kind of re-
sistance and were too excited by the con-
flict to be particularly surprised at the
peculiarly swift movements of some of the
defenders

  the little company in the laboratory
had entered thoroughly into the spirit of
the battle several times one of the men
nearly forgot he was not actually on the
scene and once or twice tom found him-
self on the point of discharging his re-
volver then and there in new york

  for over half an hour the battle raged
back and forth but at length the
scanty ammunition of the defenders began
to give out and the return shots were be-
coming fewer and farther between

  the enemy seeing this advantage be-
gan to press in man after man of the
on the brink of 



little shipwrecked company fell pierced
by bullet or savage spear slowly tom
drew his forces together toward the spot
where the women were gathered and the
latter he kept leading back as far as possi-
ble out of harms way

  at length he was in despair in a mo-
ments respite in which the cutthroats
were evidently getting their bearings for a
last sally tom turned to the professor
who was evidently a little ashamed of
himself

  professor priestley said in despair
we must do something quickly-some
trick that will frighten these people off
it will be all over in a minute if we dont

  there is one thing i have thought of
replied the inventor but it involves using
an attachment of the machine i havent
thoroughly tried out as yet that is i
can work two rays at once with one
i can receive here from somewhere with-
out an image project it on a screen here
and then reproject it out somewhere eke

  now i read yesterday that they were
to have an all-night torchlight procession
in new orleans to celebrate the advent
of the new century if i can get that line
of troops on the screen and then reproject
it over on that island i can scare the life
out of that bunch of cutthroats ill try
it you mind the main ray and keep
track of things there while i try new or-
leans

  turning a part of his levers over to
tom the professor began work with a
separate set priestley one hand on the
controlling lever and the other still hold-
ing his revolver turned his attention once
more to the scene of battle

  it was just in time the attack was
on again this time the outlaws pushed
the little band back to the very point
where the women were huddled several
more of the defenders fell it could be
only a question of minutes now

  better give up and well use you well
shouted a big bearded brute who spoke
english and seemed to be the leader

  as he spoke he stumbled in the dark-
ness over the prostrate form of a dying
man with a curse the savage fiend
thrust his spear through the poor wretch

  toms rage and horror knew no bounds
he in the image was directly in front
of this ruffian the latter caught sight
of the vague figure ahead of him in the
darkness and raising his spear came at
tom

  the latter forgot for the moment that
he was not really on the scene quick
as a flash he raised his pistol and fired
point-blank in the brutes face

  there was an outcry in the room behind
him the island and the dim struggling
mass of humanity faded away in an in-
stant as though it had been a dream

  tom glanced about bewildered and

famous fantastic mysteries

found himself standing here in the labora-
tory before a perfectly blank screen the
professor was working the levers of the
switchboard frantically

  in a moment he turned away with a
grim look at tom who was eyeing his
hot revolver with dismay

  you have shot right through my
ground cable and put the machine out of
commission said the professor

chapter xiii

the letter from the dead

the next half hour was a period of
agony for tom priestley he was
tortured by the thought that but for his
bit of absentmindedness the unhappy
castaways might have been rescued now
they were abandoned to a fate that un-
doubtedly meant death in horrible form

  the professor worked silently among his
wires and levers he had called in his work-
men at once and they were now splicing
the wire that had been severed by toms
bullet

  whether they could get it done in time
or not was a question it did not seem
possible to those who had witnessed the
last sally on the nearly defenseless casta-
ways

  most unfortunate most unfortunate
said the professor at last as he waited for
the workmen to take the final twists in
the wire that was by now nearly spliced
i had new orleans just as you fired and
i think i could have had a lively appear-
ing army among those fellows in another
minute

  now the workman who was finishing
the splicing stood up and said the work
was done the professor turned on the
current and instantly there appeared on
the screen a long line of marching men
with torchlights

  now for the island again he ex-
claimed rolling out a second screen be-
side the first

  he turned another lever and in a few
seconds they were once more sweeping the
pacific to find the island again

  the scene that finally met their eyes
about the little camp made their blood
run cold several big fires had been
lighted about them the outlaws were
making merry over their victory here
and there were most of the men of the
shipwrecked party either dead or dying
the women and children were bound and
huddled before the largest of the fires
where they were being made the targets
for coarse jests

  suddenly a sound of martial music burst
on the air at the first drum-beat the out-
laws started back aghast then they
jumped to their feet in terror

  one look was enough there march-
ing toward them in full martial array-
armed with heavy rifles in the ends of
which were inserted torches-was a long
line of troops never was there a more
imposing sight in the bygone days of actual
war

  it mattered little to the outlaws in
fact it is doubtful that they knew that
armies had for years been disbanded
this array of marching social clubs with
the historic paraphernalia they always
affected in memory of bygone war-days
had the effect desired

  with a wild cry of terror the savages
and half-savages made a break for their
boats and in a few minutes were well out
to sea

  then continuing the projection of the
troops past the camp for a time to prevent
the return of the outlaws the professor
went about among the late captives

  at first he was nonplussed by the ap-
peals for release that went up from the
women he was unable to cut thongs with
shadow-hands

  finally he found the captain of the
ship who had been only slightly wounded
and was recovering his senses to him the
professor told the whole amazing story
of his great invention and how he had
used it to aid them

  the captain first freeing two of the
other captives and sending them to re-
lease the others returned still half in-
credulous to ask more of the details he

on the brink of 

would scarcely believe that he was not
face to face with flesh and blood till the
professor convinced him of the fact by
bidding him grasp his hand when he
found it only an elusive shadow he was
convinced

  as he listened to the story of the
twenty-million-dollar fortune and the
chase after george fairweather and their
failure to find him till too late he sud-
denly sprang up in excitement

  why man he exclaimed it isnt
midnight yet and george fairweather
may be still alive he came over and
joined the fight soon after it began and
i saw him wounded but i hope he is not
dead i see you people were going by the
time in new york city which is consid-
erably earlier than it is on this meridian
i set my watch by the sun yesterday it
is now only half past eleven of december
 

  professor fleckner stared at his in-
formant for a moment in blank dumb-
founded amazement he had been so ab-



sorbed in his instrument and the chase of
the priestley fortune that he had never
thought of the obvious fact that it grew
earlier as they moved westward

  tom himself jumped up excitedly a
new hope aroused that he might yet save
his fortune

  after a few moments under the cap-
tains guidance they came upon an un-
conscious form that the captain said was
that of george fairweather the ships
doctor who was among the survivors was
summoned from another patient and pro-
nounced fairweathers wounds critical
and added that he might never recover
consciousness

  then began another race with time
with whom death was now an ally and
the odds still seemed against the priestley
fortune

  tom drew out his watch set it back
then watched the minutes tick away the
doctor tried every expedient known to his
skill still the patient lay as if dead

ten fifteen twenty minutes passed


famous fantastic mysteries

still no stir twenty-five m nutes then
the doctor looked up hopefully

  theres a sign of returning conscious-
ness said he

  for the next five minutes tom looked
on as breathless as the unconscious man
then the watch indicated twelve and tom
put it away with a disappointment all the
keener that it was the second one

  at that moment the patient stirred a
little and opened his eyes

  where am i he gasped trying in
vain to lift his head oh i remember
doctor i am going in my inside coat
pocket is a letter addressed to my cousin
in new york i-i-

  he sighed and closed his eyes again
the doctor stooped over him a moment

  hes gone this time he said

  tom turned away filled with pity and
horror this cousin of his he never knew
yet he felt the drawing of blood ties at
this moment of death

  he had felt no such call when he had
seen horace fairweather another rela-
tive struck down a few hours before but
that had been death in a moment of ex-
citement and deserved death

  for the time being tom forgot the last
words of his cousin regarding the en-
velope that was to be delivered to him
to drive from mind the thought of the
dead he busied himself comforting the
living

  it was some half-hour later that the
doctor approached him with a letter

  i found this where your cousin indi-
cated mr priestley said the doctor

  tom reached out unconsciously to take
it and the letter fell to the ground through
his shadow-hand

  i beg your pardon doctor he apolo-
gized i will have to explain

  tom then told the amazed physician
the secret of his presence or apparent
presence in the island and demonstrated
the truth of his statement

  now if you will hold that letter for
me please doctor i will be able to read
it all right he concluded

  the doctor did as requested and this is
what tom read

  deal- cousin

    i owe you a confession which i am eager
  to make now that death seems near we
  have been on this island nearly two weeks
  and i see no chance of ever getting off so
  i write this letter and enclose paper that if
  it ever reaches you it may do you some good

    my scapegrace brother horace and your
  own lawyers are in a plot to break your
  grandfathers will and substitute an earlier
  one by which they hope to get the fortune
  into horaces hands they have got my sis-
  ter out of the way and induced me to go
  too

    they will wait till the last moment be-
  fore letting you know of the existence of
  this branch of the family then when it is
  too late they will tell you so it will seem
  regular but i will sign this paper releasing
  my claim on the estate and hope it may
  reach you in time to be of some use

your repentant cousin

                      george fairweather

  then followed an affidavit drawn and
duly witnessed that fairweather relin-
quished all claims on the priestley for-
tune

 the whole had been dated two weeks
previous

  at that moment the spliced wire of the
professors machine gave way again and
the company found themselves once more
facing a blank screen in the little labora-
tory

  for a moment all sat breathless at the
sudden change in affairs then with one
accord they rushed up to congratulate
priestley

  please dont he said i have seen
tonight that there are many things more
desirable than money

  professor fleckner he added coldly
i will send you that million for your
services as soon as the stock-exchange
opens tomorrow and you too slade
he went on with equal coldness to his old
friend

  then bowing wearily to the rest of the
company thomas priestley multimil-
lionaire went forth into the dawn that was
just breaking upon the year 
r

it was after nine oclock when the
bell rang and descending to the dimly
lighted hall i opened the front door
at first on the chain to be sure of my
visitor seeing as i had hoped the face
of our friend ralph quentin i took off
the chain and he entered with a blast of
sharp november air for company i had
to throw my weight upon the door to
close it against the wind

  as he removed his hat and cloak he
laughed good-humoredly

  youre very cautious santallos i
thought you were about to demand a pass-
word before admitting me

  it is well to be cautious i retorted
this house stands somewhat alone and
thieves are everywhere

  it would require a thief of consider-
able muscle to make off with some of
your treasures that stone tomb-thing
for instance what do you call it

  the beni hassan sarcophagus yes
but what of the gilded inner case and
what of the woman it contains a thief
of judgment and intelligence might covet
that treasure and strive to deprive me
of it dont you agree

  he only laughed again and counter-
feited a shudder

  the woman dont remind me that
such a brown shriveled mummy-horror
was ever a woman

  but she was doubtless in her day
my poor princess of naam was soft ap-
pealing a creature of red moist lips and
eyes like stars in the black egyptian sky
the songstress of the house she was
called ere she became ta-nezem the
osirian but i keep you standing here in
the cold hall come upstairs with me
did i tell you that beatrice is not here
tonight

  no his intonation expressed sur-
prise and frank disappointment then i
cant say good-by to her didnt you
receive my note im to take sandersons
place as manager of the sales department
in chicago and im off tomorrow morn-
ing

  congratulations yes we had your
note but beatrice was given an oppor-
tunity to join some friends on a southern
trip the notice was short but of late
she has not been so well and i urged
her to go this november air is cruelly
damp ahd bitter

  what was it-a yachting cruise

  a long cruise she left this afternoon
i have been sitting in her boudoir quentin
thinking of her and ill tell you about it
there-if you dont mind

  wherever you like he conceded

though in a tone of some surprise i sup-
pose he had not credited me with so
much sentiment or thought it odd that
i should wish to share it with another
even so good a friend as he you must
find it fearfully lonesome here without
bee he continued

  a trifle we were ascending the dark
stairs now after tonight however
things will be quite different do you
know that i have sold the house

  no why you are full of astonish-
ments old chap found a better place
with more space for your tear-jars anr
tombstones

  he meant i assumed a witty reference
to my collection of coptic and egyptian
treasures well and dearly bought but
so much trash to a man of quentin
youth and temperament

  i opened the door of my wifes boudoir
and it was pleasant to pass into such
rosy light and warmth out of the stern
dark cold of the hall yet it was an old
house full of unexpected drafts even
here there was a draft so strong that a
heavy velour curtain at the far side of the
room continually rippled and billowed out
like a loose rose-colored sail never far
enough though to show what was behinc
it 

my friend settled himself on the
frail littie chair that stood before
my wifes dressing-table it was the kind
of chair that women love and most men
loathe but quentin for all his weight
and stature had a touch of the feminine
about him or perhaps of the feline like
a cat he moved delicately he was blond
and tall with fine regular features a
ready laugh and the clean charm of youth
about him-also its occasional blunder-
ing candor

  as i looked at him sitting there grace-
ful at ease i wished that his mind might
have shared the litheness of his body
he could have understood me so much
better

  i have indeed found a place for my
collections i observed seating myself
behind the curtain



near by in fact with a single excep-
tion-the ta-nezem sarcophagus-the
entire lot is going to the dealers seeing
his expression of astonished disbelief i
continued the truth is my dear quen-
tin that i have been guilty of gross in-
justice to our beatrice i have been too
good a collector and too neglectful a
husband my tear-jars and tombstones
in fact have enjoyed an attention that
might better have been elsewhere bestowed
yes beatrice has left me alone but the
instant that some few last affairs are
settled i intend rejoining her and you
yourself are leaving at least none of
us three will be left to miss the others
friendship

  you are quite surprising tonight san-
tallos but by jove im not sorry to
hear any of it its not my place to criti-
cize and bees not the sort to complain
but living here in this lonely old barn
of a house doing all her own work prac-
tically deserted by her friends must have
been-

  hard very hard i interrupted him
softly for one so young and lovely as
our beatrice but if i have been blind
at least the awakening has come you
should have seen her face when she heard
the news it was wonderful we were
standing just she and i in the midst of
my tear-jars and tombstones-my cham-
ber of horrors she named it you are
so apt at amusing phrases both of you
we stood beside the great stone sarco-
phagus from the necropolis of beni has-
san across the trestles beneath it lay
the gilded inner case wherein ta-nezem
the osirian had slept out so many centu-
ries you know its appearance a thing
of beautiful gleaming lines like the quaint
smiling image of a golden woman

 then i lifted the lid and showed
beatrice that the one-time songstress the
handmaiden of amen slept there no more
and the case was empty you know too
that beatrice never liked my princess
for a jest she used to declare that she
was jealous jealous of a woman deadand
ugly so many thousand years or-boi

that was only in anger-that i had bought
ta-nezem with what would have given
her beatrice all the pleasure she lacked
in life oh she was not too patient to
reproach me quentin but only in anger
and hot blood

  so i showed her the empty case and
i said beloved wife never again need
you be jealous of ta-nezem all that is
in this room save her and her belongings
i have sold but her i could not bear
to sell that which i love no man else
shall share or own so i have destroyed
her i have rent her body to brown aro-
matic shreds i have burned her it is as
if she had never been and now dearest
of the dear you shall take for your own
all the care all the keeping that heretofore
i have lavished upon the princess of
naam

  beatrice turned from the empty case
as if she could scarcely believe her hear-
ing but when she saw by the look in my
eyes that i meant exactly what i said
neither more nor less you should have
seen her face my dear quentin-you
should have seen her face

  i can imagine he laughed rather
shortly for some reason my guest seemed
increasingly ill at ease and glanced con-
tinually about the little rose-and-white
room that was the one luxurious thor-
oughly feminine corner-that and the cold
dark room behind the curtain-in what
he had justly called my barn of a
house

  santallos he continued abruptly and
i thought rather rudely you should have
a portrait done as you look tonight you
might have posed for one of those stern
old hidalgos of-which painter was it
who did so many spanish dons and don-
esses

  you perhaps mean velasquez j an-
swered with mild courtesy though secretly
and as always his crude personalities
displeased me my father you may re-
call was of cordova in southern spain
but-must you go so soon first drink
one glass with me to our missing beatrice
see how i was warming my blood against


famous fantastic mysteries

the wind that blows in even here the
wine is amontillado some that was sent
me by a friend of my fathers from the
very vineyards where the grapes were
grown and pressed and for many years
it has ripened since it came here before
she went beatrice drank of it from one
of these same glasses true wine of mon-
tilla see how it lives-like fire in amber
with a glimmer of blood behind it

  i held high the decanter and the light
gleamed through it upon his face

  amontillado isnt that a kind
of sherry im no connoisseur of wines
as you know but-amontillado

for a moment he studied the wine
i had given him liquid flame in
the crystal glass then his face cleared

  i remember the association now the
cask of amontillado ever read the
story

  i seem to recall it dimly

  horrible fascinating sort of a yarn
a fellow takes his trustful friend down
into the cellars to sample some wine traps
him and walls him up in a niche buries
him alive you understand read it when
i was a youngster and it made a deep
impression partly i think because 
couldnt for the life of me comprehend a
nature-even an italian nature-desiring
so horrible a form of vengeance youre
half latin yourself santallos can you
elucidate

  i doubt if you would ever understand
i responded slowly wondering how even
quentin could be so crude so tactless
such a revenge might have its merits
since the offender would be a long time
dying but merely to kill seems to me so
pitifully inadequate now i if i were
driven to revenge should never be con-
tented by killing i should wish to fol-
low

  what-beyond the grave

  i laughed why not wouldnt that
be the very apotheosis of hatred im try-
ing to interpret the latin nature as you
asked me to do

  confound you for an instant i thought

you were serious the way you said it made
me actually shiver

  yes i observed or perhaps it was
the draft see quentin how that curtain
billows out

  his eyes followed my glance continual-
ly the heavy rose-colored curtain that was
hung before the door of my wifes bed-
room bulged outward shook and quivered
like a bellying sail as draperies will with
a wind behind them

  his eyes strayed from the curtain met
mine and fell again to the wine in his
glass suddenly he drained it not as would
a man who was a judge of wines but
hastily indifferently without thought for
its flavor or bouquet i raised my glass
in the toast he had forgotten

  to our beatrice i said and drained
mine also though with more appreciation

  to beatrice-of course he looked at
the bottom of his empty glass then before
i could offer to refill it rose from his
chair

  i must go old man when you write
to bee tell her im sorry to have missed
her

  before she could receive a letter from
me i shall be with her-i hope how cold
the house is tonight and the wind breathes
everywhere see how the curtain blows
quentin

  so it does he set his glass on the
tray beside the decanter upon first enter-
ing the room he had been smiling but
now his straight fine brows were drawn
in a perpetual troubled frown his eyes
looked here and there and would never 
meet mine-which were steady theres
a wind he added that blows along this
wall-curious one cant notice any draft
there either but it must blow there and
of course the curtain billows out

  yes i said of course it billows
out

  or is there another door behind that
curtain

  his careful ignorance of what any fool
might infer from mere appearance brought
an involuntary smile to my lips never-
theless i answered him
behind the curtain



  yes of course there is a door an
open door

  his frown deepened my true and simple
replies appeared to cause him a certain
irritation -

  as i feel now i added even to cross
the room would be an effort i am tired
and weak tonight as beatrice once said
my strength beside yours is as a childs
to that of a grown man wont you close
that door for me dear friend

  why-yes i will i didnt know you
were ill if thats the case you shouldnt
be alone in this empty house shall i stay
with you for a while

  as he spoke he walked across the room
his hand was on the curtain but before
it could be drawn aside my voice checked
him

  quentin i said are even you quite
strong enough to close that door

  looking back at me chin on shoulder
his face appeared scarcely familiar so
drawn was it in lines of bewilderment and
half-suspicion

  what do you mean you are very-
odd tonight is the door so heavy then
what door is it

  i made no reply

  as if against their owners will his eyes
fled from mine he turned and hastily
pushed aside the heavy drapery

  behind it my wifes bedroom lay dark
and cold with windows open to the invad-
ing winds

  and erect in the doorway uncovered
stood an ancient gilded coffin-case it was
the golden casket of ta-nezem but its
occupant was more beautiful than the
poor shriveled songstress of naam

  bound across her bosom were the
strange quaint jewels which had been
found in the sarcophagus ta-nezems
amulets-heads of hathor and horus
the sacred eye the uraeus even the heavy
dull-green scarab the amulet for purity of
heart-there they rested upon the bosom
of her who had been mistress of my house
now beatrice the osirian beneath them
her white stiff body was enwrapped in
the same crackling dry brown linen bands

impregnated with the gums and resins of
embalmers dead these many thousand
years which had been about the body of
ta-nezem

  above the white translucence of her
brow appeared the winged disk emblem
of ra the twining golden bodies of its
supporting uraeii its cobras of egypt
were lost in the dusk of her hair whose
soft fineness yet lived and would live so
much longer than the flesh of any of us
three

  yes i had kept my word and given to
beatrice all that had been ta-nezems
even to the sarcophagus itself for in my
will it was written that she be placed in
it for final burial

  like the fool he was quentin stood
there staring at the unclosed frozen eyes
of my beatrice-and his stood till that
which had been in the wine began to make
itself felt he faced me then but with so
absurd and childish a look of surprise
that despite the courtesy due a guest i
laughed and laughed

  i	too felt warning throes but to me
the pain was no more than a gage-a
measure of his suffering-a stimulus to
point the phrases in which i told him all i
knew and had guessed of him and beatrice
and thus drive home the jest

  but i had never thought that a man
of quentins youth and strength could die
so easily beatrice frail though she was
had taken longer to die

  he could not even cross the room to
stop my laughter but at the first step
stumbled fell and in a very little while
lay at the foot of the gilded case

  after all he was not so strong as i
beatrice had seen her still cold eyes saw
all how he lay there his fine lithe body
contorted worthless for any use till its
substance should have been cast again in
the melting-pot of dissolution while i
who had drunk of the same draft suffered
the same pangs yet stood and found breath
for mockery

  so i poured myself another glass of
that good cordovan wine and i raised it
to both of them and drained it laughing


famous fantastic mysteries

  quentin i cried you asked what
door though your thought was that you
had passed that way before and feared
that i guessed your knowledge but there
are doors and doors dear charming
friend and one that is heavier than any
other close it if you can close it now in
my face who otherwise will follow even
whither you have gone-the heavy heavy
door of the osiris keeper of the house of
death 

thus i dreamed of doing and speaking
it was so vivid the dream that awak-
ening in the darkness of my room i
could scarcely believe that it had been
other than reality true i lived while
in my dream i had shared the avenging
poison yet my veins were still hot with
the keen passion of triumph and my eyes
filled with the vision of beatrice dead-
dead in ta-nezem casket

  unreasonably frightened i sprang from
bed flung on a dressing-gown and hurried
out down the hallway i sped swiftly and
silently at the end of it unlocked heavy
doors with a tremulous hand switched on
lights lights and more lights till the great
room of my collection was ablaze with
them and as my treasures sprang into
view i sighed like a man reaching home
from a perilous journey

  the dream was a lie

  there fronting me stood the heavy
empty sarcophagus there on the trestles
before it lay the gilded case a thing of
beautiful gleaming lines like the smiling
image of a golden woman

  i stole across the room and softly very
softly lifted the upper half of the beautiful
lid peering within the dream indeed was
a lie

  happy as a comforted child i went to
my room again across the hall the door
of my wifes boudoir stood partly open

in the next issue

in the room beyond a faint light was burn-
ing and i could see the rose-colored cur-
tail- sway slightly to a draft from some
open window

  yesterday she had come to me and asked
for her freedom i had refused knowing
to whom she would turn and hating him
for his youth and his crudeness and his
secret scorn of me

  but had i done well they were chil-
dren those two and despite my dream
i was certain that their foolish youthful
ideals had kept them from actual sin
against my honor but what if time pass-
ing they might change or quentin gone
my lovely beatrice might favor another
young as he and not so scrupulous

  every one they say has a streak of
incipient madness i recalled the frenzied
act to which my dream jealousy had
driven me perhaps it was a warning the
dream what if my fathers jealous blood
should some day betray me drive me to
the insane destruction of her i held most
dear and sacred

  i shuddered then smiled at the swaying
curtain beatrice was too beautiful for
safety she should have her freedom

  let her mate with ralph quentin or
whom she would ta-nezem must rest
secure in her gilded house of death my
brown perfect shriveled princess of the
nile destroyed-rent to brown aromatic
shreds - burned - destroyed - and her
beautiful coffin-case desecrated as i had
seen it in my vision

  again i shuddered smiled and shook
my head sadly at the swaying rosy cur-
tain

  you are too lovely beatrice i said
and my father was a spaniard you shall
have your freedom

  i entered my room and lay down to
sleep again at peace and content

  the dream thank god was a lie

after several adventures including the res-

one ant man whom he nicknames satan

horror

chapter vi

radio plays its part

i have already told you how dismayed
i was at the horror displayed by the
fair cupian when she was led into my
presence it is neither flattering nor re-
assuring to have a lady register fear and
disgust upon seeing you for the first time
it is even worse if the lady happens to
be the most divinely beautiful creature
you have ever seen and still more unbear-
able if she happens to furnish the one
human touch on an entire planet

  yet was she to be blamed

i was heavily bearded whereas male

famous fantastic mysteries

cupians so doggo said wore their hair
on the top half of their heads only i had
peculiar mushroomy growths-my ears-
on the sides of my face i had one finger
too few on each hand and one toe too
few on each foot and i was devoid of
antennae

  altogether i must have looked like a
strange and ferocious wild beast all the
more repulsive because of its resemblance
to a cupian being and if i had then
known what i do now as to the reason
why she had been brought to my quarters
i should have been even more sympathetic
with her viewpoint

  but although her horror was entirely
justified this fact in no way mitigated my
chagrin with great care i drafted a letter
of apology which i sent to her by doggo
only to have her return it unopened with
the statement that cupian ladies had
naught to do with the lower beasts

  oh if i could only talk if she could
only hear my words i felt sure that i
could break down her hostility how did
these creatures communicate anyhow
they undoubtedly had some means for
had i not seen doggo halt satan when the
latter had been about to kill me and had
i not seen doggo place on paper the ques-
tions which the four professors had wished
to ask of me

  and then i remembered the specula-
tions of some earth scientists which had
been running in the newspapers shortly
before my departure from that sphere the
opinion had been expressed that insects
communicate by very short length hertz-
ian waves i had made a note to investi-
gate this subject later but at that time

i	had been too engrossed with my machine
for the transmission of matter to be able
to give the question of insect speech more
than a mere passing thought it had not
crossed my mind again until immediately
after my sad meeting with the beautiful
cupian i was racking my brains for some
means of talking with her

  radio the very thing

  how strange that i a radio engineer
whose life work was the capture and sub-

  jugation of the hertzian wave should
have missed this solution for so long

  the solution certainly was plausible
if fireflies can produce a ninety-five per
cent efficient light and if electric eels can
generate a current sufficient to kill a horse
why should not an insect be able to send
out and receive radio messages over short
distances if animals can create light and
electricity in their bodies why can they
not create radio perhaps doggo could
enlighten me

  doggo wrote i only i called him by
his number -- instead of doggo
can ant men and cupians communicate
in any way other than writing

  of course they can he replied they
use their antennae to talk and to hear
or to send and to receive i dont
know just which way to translate the
words which he used but i caught his
meaning

  in my world i wrote people send
with their mouths and receive with their
ears let me show you how

  so speaking a few words aloud i wrote
on my pad that constitutes our kind
of sending

  but he shook his head for he hadnt
received a single word

  he then sent and of course this time
it was i who failed to receive but at
least we had made a beginning in inter-
planetary communication for we had each
tried to communicate was it not strange
that all this time while i had been ac-
cusing the inhabitants of this planet of
deafness and dumbness they had been
making the same accusation against me

at this moment the electric lights
went on and they gave me an in-
spiration

  pointing at them i wrote where are
those things made is there a department
at the university devoted to that subject
he answered there is a department of
electricity at mooni with an electrical
factory attached to the department
that said i was my line of work
on earth do you suppose that you could
the radio man



take me to mooni if you could i be-
lieve that i can construct electrical an-
tennae which will turn your kind of mes-
sage into my kind and vice versa thus
enabling us actually to talk together

  i doubt very much he replied
whether anything you do will ever enable
you to talk or to hear for you have no
antennae of course no one can either talk
or hear without antennae but there will
certainly be no harm in giving you a
chance to try

  so a petition was drawn up and signed
by doggo and me humbly begging the
council of twelve to assent to my transfer
in due course of time the professor of
anatomy-one of the four professors who
had so often examined me-visited us
again bringing with him a new ant-man
the professor of electricity they were both
very skeptical of my -theories but were
glad to assist in obtaining my transfer
as that would give them better facilities
for studying me and also an opportunity
to exhibit me to the students

  there seemed to be some doubt how-
ever as to the advisability of taking me
away from the beautiful girl but the
reason for this i could not guess at that
time as i was sure that the farther away
i was the better it would certainly suit
her

   before the two ant professors left i wtrote
for them the still unanswered question
what conclusions have been reached as
to the sort of animal i am

  they replied the majority opinion ir
that you must have come from some other
continent overseas the presence of the
boiling ocean which entirely surrounds
continental poros has prevented us poro-
vians from ever exploring the rest of our
world and even the airplanes do not dare
penetrate the steam clouds which over-
hang the sea

  but there is a tradition that a strange
race something like the cupians live be-
yond the waves you must be one of that
race since it is inconceivable that you
could have come from another planet

  a minority however are of the ojstn-

ion that passage across the boiling seas
is just as absurd no more and no less
than a trip through interplanetary space
and this minority are inclined to give cre-
dence to the theory that you come from
minos the planet next further from the
sun

  in other words the earth

  all this conversation was in writing of
course and was very slow and tedious
from their statements i gathered that
the professor of anatomy was one of
the minority so i gave him some evidence
to support his point of view

 things weigh more where i come
from wrote i and in my world a year
consists of  days

  i ins was ot course in duodecimal no-
tation the  in porovian notation
means  x  plus  x  plus 
equals  in earth notation because of
the twelve fingers the cupians count in
twelves and the formians have adopted
the same system

  my statements about the earth im-
pressed him greatly and confirmed his
belief that i was a minorian

  then the professors withdrew after
promising to assist in trying to obtain
my transfer

  while waiting for the decision of the
council of twelve time would have hung
heavy on my hands if doggo had not
thoughtfully procured for me a book en-
titled electricity for the newly hatched
of course i needed no instruction in ele-
mentary electricity nor even in advanced
electricity but i did need an introduction
to the technical terms and electrical sym-
bols of the ant language and this the
book gave me

  the council were a long time in decid-
ing for many important matters were
pending and my petition had to await
its regular turn at last however doggo
brought me the joyful news that my trans-
fer to the university of mooni had been
approved and that he was to be per-
mitted to accompany me

  i saw the beautiful girl only once more
before my departure she came to my


famous fantastic mysteries

courtyard to pick flowers as she had regu-
larly done before the fatal day of our
meeting but this time she noticed my
presence at the window and hastily left
the garden with her head tossed high and
a cruel sneer on her lips

  this made me more determined than
ever to make good in my new venture

the day of departure finally arrived
and doggo and i prepared to make
the trip i took tabby while doggo took
a strange animal of a sort i had never
seen before i had never known that doggo
had a pet but have since learned that an
excess of pets is one of the worst vices
of the formians in fact one of their
professors who has devoted his life to
the subject reports that the formians
possess some fifteen hundred species of
domesticated animals many of which do
not exist at all in a wild state and most
of which have absolutely no practical use

  doggos little beast was a mathlab
closely resembling a rabbit in size and
appearance except that it had antennae in-
stead of ears and had brick red fur these
creatures are very docile and affectionate
but breed rapidly and thus are not so
expensive nor so much esteemed as some
of the rarer varieties of beetle such as
tabby

  a closely relate animal slightly larger
black in color and not so tame is kept
for its flesh and also for its eggs which
are a staple article of porovian diet in
their wild state both species are preyed
upon by a fierce carnivore named the
woofus so that their great fecundity is all
that saves them from absolute extinction

  mooni lies about one hundred stads east
of wautoosa the city where i had been
residing the journey was made in a ker-
kool a two-wheeled automobile whose
balance is maintained by a pair of rap-
idly rotating gyroscopes driven by the
same motor which propels the vehicle
the fuel as i later learned is a synthetic
liquid resembling alcohol and supposed
to be extremely poisonous

  there were no seats for ant men do

not sit down but a chair for me had
thoughtfully been added to the equipment
thechauffeur or kerko as they call him
wore goggles very much like those used on
the earth and similar pairs were provided
for doggo and me

  the trip was easily and pleasantly made
in about one porovian hour

  the way lay through rolling fields
where grazed herds of green cows guarded
by huge spiders and through fragrant
woods where i saw many strange animals
taken unawares by the swift approach of
our kerkool many questions were on the
tip of my pencil but conversation was
difficult for the motion of the kerkool
jiggled my pad

  at mooni there was a large crowd of
ant men awaiting our arrival and mingled
with them were many cupians the first
that i had seen other than the girl at
wautoosa they were a handsome race
and i began to wonder what chance i could
possibly have in competition with them
as an aspirant for the hand of one of
their women even if i were to shave grow
wings and antennae and cut off my ears
their complexions ranged from pink and
white to tan and their hair sometimes
close and sometimes curly ran through
all the colors of human hair

  the ant professor of electricity met us
at the city gate introduced me to the
crowd with a few inaudible remarks which
were received in silence then he showed
me to my quarters where i had a chance
to wash up put on a clean toga and take
a much-needed rest

  that evening a dinner was given in my
honor at a large banquet hall at the head
table stood the president of the ant uni-
versity the committee of four ant-men
which had examined me so often the ant
professor of electricity a visiting cupian
professor doggo and myself at the other
tables stood other and lesser members of
the faculty and students both cupian and
formian

  i was the cynosure of all eyes and-so
doggo informed me in writing-the sub-
ject of most of the speeches i had to take
the radio man



his word for it that there were speeches
for so far as i could tell not a word was
said i could not even watch the speaker
rise and give his talk for all were already
standing

  altogether it was a very dull occasion
for me in spite of my being the lion of
the evening besides i was eager to be
done with the preliminaries and get busy
with my real work

  the food was plenteous and varied
among the dishes which i remember were
a highly seasoned stew of the red lobster-
like parasite which afflicts the aphids
minced wild mathlab with mathlab egg
sauce and something resembling mush-
rooms only not so rich

  several of the cupian maidens in the
audience made eyes at me not that they
thought me prepossessing with my big
black beard but rather in much the same
spirit that would induce an earth maiden
to flirt with a gorilla in a cage just to
see what effect it would have on the beast
it had absolutely no effect on me for the
picture of the girl at wautoosa was ever
present in my mind

  so i was glad when the banquet was
over and i could go to my room and my

bed	and pleasant dreams in which a
cupian damsel and i walked hand in hand
through a roseate future

  no guard was placed over me at mooni
but doggo shared my room

  the next morning i was inducted into
the laboratory the critical point of my
career had arrived was i to succeed and
become a nine days wonder and perhaps
distinguish myself sufficiently to find favor
in the eyes of the beautiful girl at wau-
toosa or was i to fail and return dis-
credited heaven only knew but time
would tell

  the ant superintendent of the labora-
tory assigned me a bench a kit of tools
and two cupian slaves as assistants he
was most deferential and did all that he
could to help me but my handicaps were
many i was not versed in their electrical
machinery i was unaccustomed tou-their
tools which looked for all the world as

though they had been copied from the
monstrosities which appear weekly in the
official gazette of the united states
patent office all my conversations with
either superiors or subordinates had to
be carried on in writing in a strange
language which i had only just recently
and just barely mastered

  but worst of all most of my time had
to be devoted to appearing before classes
as a horrible example of what nature can
do in an off moment to being examined
both physically and in writing by com-
mittees of scientists to entertainments
staged in my honor and to sight-seeing
about the city	

  my hosts were determined to do every-
thing in their power to make me enjoy
my visit when if they had but known
it my only desire was to devote myself
to my self-appointed task so that i could
speedily return to wautoosa which held
all that was dear to me on this planet

  from time to time i would inquire
about her of doggo and he would assure
me that she was due to stay indefinitely
at wautoosa and would certainly be there
upon my return

in spite of vexatious interruptions my
work gradually progressed i found that
although all electric current on poros is
derived from dynamos of a multisolenoidal
oscillating type and although batteries
are unknown yet the porovians do pos-
sess efficient storage batteries in which
a very large amount of current can be
stored in a very small space these i
used for my a batteries

  for my b and c batteries i constructed
dry cells to the amazement of my asso-
ciates who could not figure out where the
current came from even though my main
experiment failed this feat of plucking
electricity out of nowhere as it were
would make my fame secure on poros

  the sight-seeing trips included the vari-
ous factories each under the control of
the appropriate university department for
the formians are well skilled in all the
arts although the fine work has to be


famous fantastic mysteries

done by cupian slaves whose fingers are
more efficient than the claws of the ant
men only practical arts are employed in
formia although the cupians go in for
painting sculpture architecture et cetera

  i slung the three batteries on a belt
about my waist this belt also carried a
tube and my tuning apparatus of a par-
ticularly selective type which i had de-
signed on earth and for which i now have
a united states patent pending unless
my patent attorneys have abandoned it
through want of word from me

  i now adapted this design to an unusu-
ally short wave length in order to comply
with what i remembered to be the specula-
tions of earth scientists on the method of
insect communication my triad was of
the indestructo type invented by me on
earth or it never could have withstood my
subsequent adventures

  from a skull cap i suspended two ear
phones and a microphone and on top of
the cap i mounted a small pancake coil
the microphone gave me more trouble
than any other part of the set as carbon
of the exact sort required seemed hard
to get on poros but finally after testing
several hundred other materials i hit upon
a very common light silvery metal which
did just as well this metal i am unable
to identify but i think that it is one of
the platinum group more probably
osmium

  i spent four months of earth time in
the laboratories of mooni growing more
and more homesick for wautoosa if it
had not been for the consoling assurances
of the faithful doggo i do not believe
that i could have stood it so many were
the interruptions to my work

  of all the diversions offered me only
one interested me at all and that was
the zoo or gr-ool-ie animal place-as
they termed it and the most amusing
part of the gr-ool was the monkey house
of course there are no monkeys on poros
but i refer to this place as a monkey
house because that is what it would cor-
respond to on earth

  here were kept specimens of all the wild

species of ant known on the planet except
in size and color i could discover no
features which would distinguish any of
them from the ant-man

  one day seeing my interest doggo
wrote down for me

  some of the species are very intelli-
gent so much so that they were formerly
bred in large quantities for slaves before
the great war and the treaty of mooni
supplied formia with a superior substi-
tute

  did it ever occur to anyone i asked
that these creatures might be either im-
mature or degenerate formians

  he was horrified

  these wild ants he explained are
the basis of one of the great intellectual
disputes of this planet-namely as to
whether or not we are merely a superior
species of ants or whether we are an en-
tirely distinct type of being specially cre-
ated and not a part of the animal king-
dom at all

  most of the university men hold that
we are related to these brutes and this is
likewise the more modern view but fortu-
nately there is an influential body of opin-
ion high in the politics of this country
which considers that such a view is too
degrading to admit of acceptance and
acordingly the council of twelve is even
now seriously considering a law intended
to prohibit the teaching of this dangerous
doctrine

  how about the cupians i asked
have they any such evolutionary prob-
lem

  no he wrote fortunately for them
they have no problem of evolution for
they are the only non-egg-laying creatures
on poros and so do not regard themselves
even as mammals

  whereat i wondered to myself whether
it was not probable that it was this dis-
tinctiveness of the cupians which had in-
spired the jealous formians to deny their
own obvious kinship to the ants

  in addition to the gr-ool i frequently
visited the stuffed specimens in the
museum of their department of biology
the radio man



the absence oi any birds either here or
at the gr-ool perplexed me until i re-
flected that birds are merely a specialized
form of flying lizards on my own earth
and that their occurrence even on earth
was merely a not-to-have-been-expected
accident creatures similar to pterodactyls
were among the extinct species on exhibit
at mooni but birds had never been known
on poros although i could have sworn
to having seen some sort of small bird
flitting in tandem pairs in the woods on my
second day on the planet

  but to get back to radio by the way
that is how i always felt during my trips
to the gr-ool and my other diversions oh
to get back to radio i

  one of the cupian slaves who was assist-
ing me turned out to be prince toron
second nephew of king kew xii torons
older brother yuri was the crown prince
as the king was a widower and childless
except for a daughter lilia torons term
of slavery was nearly completed and he
was anxious to return to cupia where a
days work was only two parths or poro-
vian hours instead of five as prevailed
here

  think of the degral ition of having a
prince of the royal house of cupia held
as a slave in the factories of an alien race
think of the further degradation involved
in the fact that no one saw anything im-
proper in the situation  they even cele-
brated annually as peace day the anni-
versary of the treaty which had imposed
this indignity upon them

  toron i wrote one day would not
war be infinitely better than such a
leace

  yes he admitted there is some sen-
timent among the younger men of my
country against the rule of the ant-men
but the ant-men are all-powerful and
promptly suppress treason with an iron
hand so i am afraid that our cause is
hopeless

  as the time for the completion of my
experiment drew near i thought of my
massive beard and decided that it must
be removed before i again faced the beau-

tiful girl at wautoosa also my hair needed
attention cupian hair does not have to be
cut and does not grow at all on the face
which fact must be a great convenience to
them

  with the aid of toron and a pair of
wire clippers i managed to trim my hair
to a respectable state leaving long locks
however to obscure my ears i also clipped
my beard as close as possible and then
finished the job with a sharp laboratory
knife of the sort of copper commonly-
but erroneously-called tempered on
earth and some lubricating grease

  and behold with the minor exception
of wings fingers toes and antennae i was
as presentable appearing a cupian as any
one would wish to see thereafter i kept
the knife and shaved daily later mak-
ing myself real soap for the purpose

  the change in my appearance resulted
in more delay for i was immediately ex-
hibited to all the classes again and was
forced to write a long essay on haircuts
and shaving as practiced upon my own
planet minos

  interest in me had lagged somewhat
and i had been given more time with my
work but now interest revived again and
interrupted me considerably

  nevertheless my apparatus was at last
completed and i was ready for the test
the next day my work was to be inspected
by a committee of ant scientists so with
trembling fingers i adjusted the controls
and bade toron speak to me

  the result was-silence

chapter vii

a hunting trip

my radio set was a failure i could
not hear toron and he could not
hear me all my labor of four months in
the laboratories of mooni had gone to
waste

  perhaps the porovian scientists were
right and the earth scientists were wrong
and insects did not communicate by hertz-
ian waves after all yet i was unwilling to
give up
so

famous fantastic mysteries

  so i begged toron to talk in as many
different ways as he could and at last was
rewarded by a slight squeak in my ear-
phones then i myself tried talking now
loud now soft now high now low until
at last when i yelled at a particularly high
pitch toron reported that he too had
heard the earth scientists were vindi-
cated communication was established

  the sounds had been received and sent
at the very shortest wave length within
the powers of my apparatus so i now
determined to reduce that wave length
still further

  late into the night i worked frantically
and toron catching some of my contagious
enthusiasm worked with me

  at first i experimented with various sizes
and shapes of coil antennas but i was
confronted with weak signals of short wave
length any change in my apparatus which
reduced my wave length also reduced my
receptivity and any change which in-
creased my receptivity likewise increased
my wave length so i was between the
devil and the deep sea finally i tried
condenser antennas without plates two
rods and then we were rewarded by
speech clear distinct and unmistakable

  we ceased our work exhausted but
before turning in for the night toron
taught me how to say in porovian language
the following sentence the planet minos
sends to the placet poros and informs
poros that minos was right communica-
tion between porovians is electrical

  i told him that my name was myles s
cabot a fact which i had previously had
no means of imparting to any one then
we separated for the night

  the next morning the committee were
astounded at my success although i was
most anxious to get back to wautoosa at
once the committee insisted on my re-
maining and demonstrating my apparatus
and this took several weeks more

  but at last i was permitted to return

  on my arrival i was informed that the
girl was still there so at once i requested
an interview at first she refused to re-
ceive me but doggo who acted as go-

between finally succeeded in arousing her
interest by hinting to her that the scientists
atmooni had discovered that i was really
a cupian after all and a very handsome
one at that now that they had succeeded
in completely removing my former de-
formities so at last she reluctantly con-
sented apparently she had heard no news
of the great doings at mooni

  i planned for this meeting with even
more care and application than i had
spent upon my radio apparatus every-
thing that doggo and i were to say and
do was carefully rehearsed my speeches
of course had to be learned by rote for
i had as yet no opportunity to study the
spoken language of poros

  we built a head frame of heavy wire
concealed in my hair and arranged the
phones so that they would lie unobserved
under the locks which covered my ears
the batteries tube tuning-apparatus and
one rod were on my back carried by a
belt and hidden beneath my toga the
other rod and a dummy mate to it were
affixed to my forehead and camouflaged
to resemble cupian antennae my small
microphone was located between my col-
lar bones where the front edge of my
toga just concealed it of course i could
have mounted both of my real rods on
my forehead but that would have re-
duced the capacityenough so as to have
increased my wave length out of the re-
quired range hence the seemingly unneces-
sary complication of my arrangement

  the need for tuning-apparatus requires
some explanation porovians tune for the
slight difference in individual wave length
by moving their antennae but this of
course was not practicable to me so i
employed for this purpose a microscopic
variable condenser on my belt

  to complete my disguise we even went
to the extent of fastening artificial wings
to my back so that except for the slight
peculiarity of my hands and feet i looked
and sounded like a real cupian

  then we were ushered into the presence
of the lady she was a beautiful and regal
figure as she sat poised uoon a richly
the radio man



upholstered dais garbed in the grecian
simplicity of the cupian national costume
in her arms snuggled a pet mathlab which
i noted with a twinge of jealousy

he was unmistakably taken aback by
the change in my appearance and
only a hasty glance at my hands and feet
convinced her that she was not being made
the victim of a practical joke but she
quickly recovered her dignity and frigidly
awaited our advances

  doggo opened the conversation
gracious lady said he myles cabot
and i pay our most humble respects as
you can see he is now a full-fledged
cupian with the minor exception of fin-
gers and toes the object of this interview
is that he may reassure you and apologize
for the fright which he caused you when
last you two met

  i then stepped forward in spite of njy
transformation she cringed a bit i must
admit evidently she still remembered my
horrible beard for she kept studying my
face inquiringly

  i spoke my memorized piece as fol-
lows gracious lady i am your everlast-
ing slave from whom you need fear no
harm

  and then she spoke the sweetest most
tinkling silvery voice that i have ever
heard somehow i had known that her
voice must be like that of course i did
not yet understand the spoken language
of this planet but i stood enchanted

  doggo afterward wrote out for me te
substance of her remarks which were that
she was thrown in contact with me against
her will but that if i comported myself
circumspectly she would condescend to
tolerate my acquaintance or words to that
effect never once did her cold manner
relax and yet i fancied the merest twinkle
of interest in her heaven-blue eyes

  we withdrew fully satisfied that an
opening had been made

  doggo at once wanted to report the
occurrence to headquarters whereas i in-
sisted that the affair concerned no onojjut
myself	

  why should headquarters care i
asked

  his reply astounded me it took paper
and pencil and a great deal of explaining
before i finally grasped the horrible fact
that the cupian girl had been brought to
wautoosa so that the formians might
breed us like cattle in an attempt to per-
petuate my peculiar species no wonder
that she still revolted from me in spite
of my more presentable present appear-
ance

  teach me to talk i pleaded on paper
in order that i may explain to her that
she has nothing to fear from me and that
i will guard her honor with my life

  doggo could not understand my senti-
ments but he had enough friendship for
me so that he respected them on my ac-
count accordingly he set to work in-
structing me chiefly by making me read
aloud and take dictation the language
turned out to be phonetic after all in
fact it is very like pitman shorthand
although not quite so compact

  as i already knew the written language
pretty thoroughly i made rapid progress
in the radiated language so that in a very
few weeks i became really proficient
now i learned the names cupian and
formian and a great many other words
which i have used earlier in this narrative
although only their written forms were
known to me at that time

  i was now able to write my name pho-
netically heretofore i had used for my
name the plural of the character for their
unit of measure stad a poor pun for
myles

  every few days i saw the lady briefly
at first our conversations were very formal
consisting on my part almost entirely of
set speeches committed to memory but
gradually as i mastered the language i
became able to understand her and to im-
provise a bit

  one afternoon about fifty days after
my return from mooni i said to doggo
doubtless apropos of something that was
in my lesson

  tell me have you any name of your


famous fantastic mysteries

own i have called you doggo right along
and you havent seemed to mind it so
it has never occurred to me before to ask
your real name

  no he replied i have no name that
is why i felt highly honored when you
called me one cupians have names but
we formians except in the case of our
queen formis have merely numbers
these numbers are in three parts the first
part representing the year of hatching
the second the month of hatching and
the third the serial registration number of
the individual thus my number --
means that i was the twentieth formian
hatched in the second month of the four
hundred and eighty-fourth year following
the great peace

  let me explain here that a year on
poros is made up of twenty months of
twelve days each a day is twelve parths
or about twenty-two and a half earth
hours so that a parth is about one hour
and fifty-two and a half minutes of earth
time

  i would have asked him then what was
the meaning of the other and smaller
numbers on his back but i was more in-
terested in learning about the beautiful
lady it was strange that i had never
asked her name of either herself or doggo
but i had always called her gracious
lady with never a thought of any further
title

  now i inquired if all cupians have
names what then is the name of the gra-
cious lady

  at this question doggos antennae quiv-
ered with suppressed excitement

  never ask that question again of any
one he adjured me do not even ask
the lady herself there are reasons of
state against your being told

to relieve this strained situation
i changed the subject saying oh
by the way it has just occurred to me
to ask the cause of the accident to our
airplane on the day of my capture
whereat doggo mollified explained as
follows our airplanes are stabilized en-

tirely by gyroscopes

  i interjected on my planet minos
we depend upon the shape and design of
the wings

  be that as it may continued doggo
we use gyroscopes on the particular oc-
casion in question the gyroscopes broke
down thus crippling the plane as com-
pletely as if it had lost a wing and so
bringing it to the ground

  as we were on the subject i asked
what is the reason for the peculiar shape
of your flying machines for i had no-
ticed that they were built with long flex-
ible tails so that the general appearance
was that of a dragon fly

  oh said doggo the tail is the fight-
ing element of a porovian airship th
green cows whose milk furnishes such an
important part of the diet of us formians
are preyed upon by the enormous bees
such as the one who fell into the same
spider-web with you shortly after your
arrival on this planet these bees are
chiefly noted for their honey and for the
peculiar shrill noise which they radiate
on which account they are called whist-
ling bees

  airplanes exist for the sole purpose
of combating these predatory creatures
by one of the terms of the treaty of
mooni the cupians are not allowed to
possess planes and accordingly all of the
policing of the air had to be done by the
imperial air navy of the formians this
city wautoosa where we are now stay-
ing is the barracks for the air navy and
contains nothing else which accounts for
the absence of visiting cupians here i
am a high ranking naval officer an eklat
whereas the one you call satan is only
a pootah

  thus explained doggo i gathered that
the ranks of eklat and pootah correspond
respectively to commander and lieutenant
junior grade on earth

  i having done my share to relieve the
tension caused by my asking of doggo
the name of the cupian girl he now in turn
invited me to go on a bee hunt which
i accepted purely for politeness sake as
the radio man

i did not care to travel far from the lady
but perhaps such a diversion would be
just as well until i had made more pro-
gress in mastering the spoken langauge

  so about a week after the conversation
above related i embarked with two young
officers for a part of the country where
it had been reported that several bees were
preying upon the flocks doggo remained
behind at wautoosa because of certain
important military duties

  the trip took almost an entire day and
we put up for the night at a small farm-
ing village the farmer ants displayed a
true rustic interest in my peculiarities
which the two young bar-pootahs or en-
signs took great pleasure in showing off
my fame had evidently reached this com-
munity but with it a myth to the effect
that my electrical antennae could discharge
not only speech but also death-dealing
tightning at will

  i treasured this piece of information-
it might come in handy some time

  early the next morning we started forth
to the field where the most recent bovicides
had taken place and concealed our plane
in some woods by the edge of the field we
had not long to wait for soon we were
rewarded by a whistling sound at which
we sailed out to meet the enemy

  the nations airy navies grappling in
the central blue of which tennyson sings
cant hold a candle to a battle between an
ant flyer and a whistling bee

  at the start we circled each other each
looking for an opening and each trying
to get on the back of the other in this
game the airplane had a certain advantage
for it was provided with grappling hooks
both above and below and could work its
tail either up or down to strike at its
antagonist whereas the bee of course
had legs only on the bottom side and
could bend his sting only downward thus
even if the bee should alight on the top
of the plane the fight would still remain
fairly even but if the plane should alight
on top of the bee it would be all over
for the poor bee	

  in addition the plane bad its fuel tank

and its control levers located way to the
front as far as possible out of reach of
the sting of the bee but the bee had the
advantage of unified control that is to
say one of the ant ensigns flew the ma-
chine while the other manipulated the
fighting tail whereas the bee controlled
both his sting and his wings with a single
brain

round and round we circled first
the plane on top and then the bee
the two young ant-men were accomplished
flyers so that loop-the-loop tail-spins
direct drops and other maneuvers were
possible and it took all of these expedi-
ents to elude our antagonist but at last
the bee made some slight misplay and
instantly we were upon his back with
the grappling hooks sunk in his sides and
in a moment our fighting tail was driven
home and the battle was over the grap-
pling hooks were then released and the
carcass cast to the ground

  upon our alighting shortly thereafter
one of the ant men exclaimed we cer-
tainly are in luck for there is the bees
honey pot

  and sure enough there in front of us
was a silk lined opening in the ground
more than a yard in diameter and now
i learned whence came the honey which
the formians had frequently served me
for it seems that these huge bees as large
as horses burrow into the ground to the
depth of ten or twelve feet line the hole
with silk of their own spinning and then
use it as a reservoir for their most excel-
lent honey this in spite of their carni-
vorous proclivities is almost identical to
the honey made by bees on earth

  one of the bar-pootahs now uncoiled
a long hose from the airship and stuck
the end into the honey reservoir while
the other started up the motor and soon
we were filling one of our spare tanks with
the luscious syrup of which there were
about one hundred gallons in the hole

  but we had made one mistake for this
was not the hole of our late victim it
belonged instead to another bee who sud-


famous fantastic mysteries

denly appeared angrily on the scene if
we had not been warned by his whistling
we should have been out of luck and as
it was we barely had time to scramble
aboard and rise from the ground before
he was upon us

  then began a repetition of our former
fight but with a difference as we soon
noticed for this bee was a master of aerial
tactics once when we were nearly upon
his back he darted ahead and then rose
and halted so that we nearly drove our
ship onto the point of his sting but for-
tunately our pilot caught the idea of the
maneuver almost before it was executed
and quickly threw us into a left-handed
spiral thus not only escaping the deadly
sting but also giving the bee a bad bruise
with one of our wings as we shot by

  a move like this would of course be
rendered entirely impossible by the steady-
ing influence of the gyroscopes were it
not for the fact that the control apparatus
is so arranged that the gyroscopes maintain
their position while the whole rest of the
machine spirals around them

  for a while thereafter we had the ad-
vantage and finally by a clever shift de-
scended squarely upon the back of the

bee	but just as our hooks were about to
take hold the bee again darted forward
and looped in front of us turning over at
the same time so that he was right side
up above us then as we passed under
him he dropped upon the front of our
machine out of reach of our tail

  my but that was a well executed
move exclaimed one of the bar-pootahs
i never saw a whistling bee do that be-
fore

  airmen are ever appreciative of a clever
opponent on poros as on earth and even
in defeat these were the last words my
friend ever spoke for at that moment
he was impaled by the enemy the next
stroke punctured the fuel tank the other
ant man jumped and the plane crashed
to earth pinning me beneath it

  i lay stunned for a few moments and
then the angry bee bunted the wreck to
one side pulled me from beneath it and

brandished his sting above me prepara-
tory to driving into my vitals

chapter viii

the conspiracy

just as the sting was about to pierce
my breast i recognized the bee it
was the same one which had been my com-
panion in the spider web and which 
had rescued there was the leg-stump and
the scarred abdomen what irony of fate
that this bee should have now returned to
kill me

  dont i shrieked aloud was it for
this that i saved you from the spider

  and it almost seemed as though he
heard me and understood me for he stayed
his rapier in mid air then he recognized
me too at least he must have done so
for in no other way can i explain his
sudden clemency instead of finishing his
stroke the bee withdrew his sting gazed
intently on me for several seconds and
then flew heavily away

  once more my life was saved

  when i had recovered my breath 
struggled weakly to my feet and looked
about me the plane was a hopeless wreck
the impaled bar-pootah was still in his
place at the levers the one who had
jumped was lying crushed and silent near
by  was alone in a small open spot in
the woods

   after ascertaining that the crushed ant-
man was beyond all help i started off in
as nearly a straight direction as i could
lining up first one pair of trees and then
another in order to keep from traveling in
a circle the absence of any direct sun-
light made orientation very difficult for
without any shadows to judge by it was
impossible to tell north from south or
east from west

  again as on my second day on this
planet i noticed the peculiar fauna of the
woods and especially the strange birds
which seemed to fly in tandem pairs
finally as i passed through a small clear-
ing a pair flew near me and to my sur-
prise i found that it was not a pair at all
the radio man

but rather a single animal in fact it was
not a bird at all but rather a reptile of
some sort resembling a lizard with a
wing where each leg should be-a veritable
flying snake about three feet long

  as this peculiar winged creature flut-
tered near and saw me it uttered a shrill
squeak and rushed at my head the squeak
was answered in various directions and
almost immediately several more flying
snakes began to converge upon me from
all sides luckily for me there was a stout
stick lying close at hand and seizing
this i began to defend myself

  more and more of the strange aerial
snakes arrived and soon i was surrounded
by a swarm of them all striving to strike
at my head regardless of my frantic at-
tempts to beat them off

  i was rapidly tiring from my efforts
when a diversion offered in the form of
a new enemy-a lavender colored hairless
catlike beast about the size of a large
dog-which bounded into the clearing with
a blood-curdling scream

  forgotten were the flying snakes as i
clambered into a tree just barely in time
to escape this new onslaught and for-
gotten apparently was i by them for
they scattered to the four winds of heaven
leaving me alone with the purple beast
which paced screaming beneath my tree
i felt perfectly safe where i sat for the
creature did not appear to be a climber
but its hideous howls were most annoying
until i noticed that the noise came entirely
from my headset so i switched off the
current and instantly all was silence

  but even the silence and the compara-
tive safety of the tree were not particu-
larly pleasant the beast was anything but
pretty resembling a mountain lion except
that it was lavender colored and hairless
with antennae and webbed feet

  so this was the woofus of which i had
heard so much the most dreaded carnivore
of all poros one of these it was said
was easily a match for three or four ant-
men so what chance had i perched in
my tree if my captor chose to hang
around until hunger and thirst should

force me to descend

  but this question never was answered
for luckily for me something else pres-
ently attracted the attention of the woofus
and it trotted off into the woods i
switched on my radio and heard its
screams gradually fade away in the dis-
tance

  when all was silent again i descended
and picked up the line of trees which i
had been following when i entered the
clearing soon i came to another clear-
ing there in the center lay a crippled
airplane and beside it the dead body of
a huge ant it was my own plane i had
traveled in a circle after all

  in despair i sat down on the side of
the airship how was i ever to get out
of this wood

  and then the fading daylight gave me
a clew to one side the silver gray of the
sky was darkening while to the other it
was assuming a pinkish hue i could now
tell east from west and if i hurried and
if the way was not too far i could follow
a straight line out of the wood while it
was still light so off i set due west to-
ward the pink of the unseen setting sun
just as the pink light finally died out
before me and all became jet black on
every hand i reached a concrete road at
last and sat down exhausted on its edge

i must have slept for the next thing
that i knew i was flooded by a bright
light and then a kerkool stopped beside
me and i was hailed a cheery yahoo
the driver was a lone ant-man

  i struggled sleepily to my feet
  yahoo i said whither

  to wautoosa he replied can i
accommodate you

  you certainly can said i for i am
from wautoosa myself and have just been
in an airplane wreck which killed both
my companions two bar-pootahs of the
imperial air navy

  crawl in then said he

  so i accepted his invitation and
promptly fell sound asleep again in the
bottom of the kerkool where my new host
had the decency to let me lie undisturbed


famous fantastic mysteries

in the morning we stopped at a road-
side tavern where i was awakened
for breakfast the driver of the kerkool
was a rich farmer ant on the way to wau-
toosa on government business from one of
the southern provinces he had heard of
me and was very much interested in my
recent adventures and i in turn was glad
to find that i could talk with him quite
fluently we spent the morning chatting
pleasantly as we rode along and stopped
for lunch at another tavern where we ate
a particularly delectable mess of fried
mashed purple grasshoppers served with
honey

  in the afternoon conversation lagged a
bit and finally to kill time my host
undertook to teach me how to drive the
kerkool the control was not unlike that
of an earth automobile so i caught on
readily enough and in fact drove the
machine for the last hour or so and into
wautoosa which we reached just before
supper-time

  there i bade farewell to the ant and
proceeded at once to headquarters to
report the loss of the plane to the winko
or admiral of the entire air navy then
i returned to my quarters where i bathed
and changed and had supper with doggo
to whom i related the sad fate of his
friends

  tabby was there and was glad to see
me but i should not say see for these
pet buntlotes of the ants are totally blind
being guided entirely by their sense of
smell which is very keen they smell with
their antennae as well as hear these two
senses being commingled in much the same
way as we are taught on earth to regard
the two components of the hertzian wave
namely electrostatic and electromagnetic

  but enough of tabbys methods of per-
ception doggo informed me to my joy
that the cupian lady had been moved to
quarters adjoining my own and had ex-
pressed herself as no longer unfriendly
toward me

  the next morning i called upon her

  i had now made sufficient progress with
the spoken language so that we were able

to chat quite pleasantly together she had
me tell my entire adventures since my
arrival on the planet and punctuated my
narrative with many pretty ohs and
ahs at the various points at which my
life was endangered and then spared we
parted very good friends it seemed to
me at least she no longer regarded me
as a repulsive wild beast which was some
consolation and encouragement

  in the succeeding days we became better
and better acquainted she telling me a
a great deal about her planet and i in turn
telling-her about my life on earth but i
-warned by doggo-never once suggested
that she tell me who she was and she on
her part showed no inclination to do so

  doggo at my insistence made no re-
port to headquarters that her hostility to
me had ceased

  frequently she and i dined together
our favorite dish was a stew of alta the
mushroomlike plant which the ant men
cultivate underground on beds of chopped
tartan leaves the secret of growing this
plant had been carefully guarded by the
formians and has never been learned by
the cupians it tastes much like chestnuts
only not so rich and forms the chief part
of ant diet much like rice among the
japanese

all this time i had seen nothing of
my old enemy satan in fact i had
seen nothing of him since he had tried to
kill me many months ago i had dismissed
him from my mind and so was much
surprised when one day he swaggered into
my quarters in a particularly truculent
mood doggo was with me at the time
and bristled up at the others approach
it was plain that the two did not care
for each other

  how is your pet mathlab from the
planet minos sneered satan

  now to call a person a mathlab is
one of the worst insults that can be offered
on the planet poros it is as bad as to
call a man a skunk a sandless puppy and
a cur all at once in the united states or
a chameau in france and although the
the radio man



insult was directed at me yet as it was
spoken to my friend doggo it was he who
had been really insulted

  doggo kept his temper admirably but
answered the sneer with another sneer
you forget yourself to speak so to a
superior officer my only explanation is
that you have been chewing some saffra
root

  the saffra is a peculiar narcotic plant
which is cultivated on poros both for its
anesthetic qualities and also for use in
much the same way as alcohol is employed
on earth so that doggo had virtually ac-
cused satan of being drunk which was
both a charitable way of explaining satans
insubordinate language and a deadly in-
sult in itself

  satan clicked his jaws in rage and
hurled at doggo the words ill get your
number

  to which doggo calmly replied ill
get yours 

  and to my surprise the two rushed at
each other and started fighting

  never before having seen a duel between
two ant-men i did not then know how
common duels are nor that they transcend
all rank the proper formality for chal-
lenging to a duel is to say as satan had
ill get your number and the proper
formality for accepting the challenge is
to speak as doggo had spoken

  the battle was a sort of combined
wrestling bout and fencing match the two
huge creatures tumbling over and over
on the floor each trying to get his man-
dibles at the others neck and each parry-
ing with his own mandibles the thrusts
of the other

  finally to my horror satan slipped
by doggos guard and fastened his jaws
pn doggos throat he could easily and
instantly have severed doggos head but
he apparently preferred to hold him for a
moment and gloat over his victim and this
delay gave me the opportunity to come out
of my coma seize a chair and rush to
doggos rescue

  but to my surprise it was dogga liim-
self who ordered me back

  this is a duel to the death he said
and it is not etiquette for any one to
interfere

  satan turned his horrid eyes to me and
remarked

  wait a few minutes until i finish your
friend and i will get your number too

  go to it i replied in english not
then knowing the correct formalities but
being perfectly willing to try my chances
again with my old enemy

  what was that peculiar remark asked
satan mathlab language or perchance
the way that half-wits talk on minos

  keeping my temper i answered

  what i said was for you to come and
get my number if you can

  this diversion proved unfortunate for
satan he should have severed doggos
head while he had jjim in his power for
while his attention was distracted by his
conversation with me doggo suddenly
wrenched loose and with a snap rolled
satans head upon the floor

  then doggo shook himself went to
the door and called for assistance and
shortly three ant soldiers entered two of
whom removed the dead body and the
third of whom brought a paint pot and
brush with which he proceeded to paint
on doggos back under doggos own num-
ber and the string of smaller ones the
number which had been satans in life

  so this was the meaning of the small
numbers and also of the formal words
used in challenging and accepting the chal-
lenge to a duel doggo had got satans
number in truth and now so far as i
knew i had no enemy on all poros

  a few days later in one of the corridors
i ran across the first male cupian whom i
had ever seen at wautoosa he was even
handsomer than the cupians whom i had
met at the university of mooni in fact
he was the most handsome cupian man
that i have ever seen either before or
since he had curly chestnut hair a
straight nose and regal features and bear-
ing

  but he seemed furtive and in a great
hurry dragging me into a near-by room
famous fantastic mysteries



he closed the curtains

  place your antennae close to mine
he cautioned and radiate very softly
this is a matter of life and death to one
who is very dear to both of us

  the beautiful cupian i gasped
the very same he replied the
princess lilia daughter of king kew of
cupia illegally detained as a prisoner by
the formians

  so that was why her identity was sealed 
  and who are you i asked

  i am her unhappy cousin yuri next
in succession to the throne of cupia he
answered

  yes i had heard of him from his
younger brother prince toron who had
been my assistant in the laboratories of
mooni

  yuri continued i have long loved the
beautiful princess but she ignored me
and so blinded to all sense of right and
wrong by my passion i arranged with the
department of eugenics at mooni to have
her kidnaped into formia for the purpose
of forcing her to marry me and thus in-
augurate a strain of perfect cupians

  i knew from toron of yuris great
influence among the ant-men due to his
being the leader of the court party in
cupia who believed in the most abject
adherence to the treaty of mooni and
i could well believe that a splendid race
would spring from this pair the two most
perfect specimens of all cupia

  yuri went on with his tale all of
cupia was turned upside down searching
for the princess but of course no searching
by cupians was possible in formia and
the authorities of the latter country gave
out no intimation that they knew the
whereabouts of the princess my implica-
tion in lilias kidnaping was unknown to
her and so on meeting me here at wau-
toosa she hailed me as a possible rescuer
i could restrain my indignation no
longer

  what duplicity i shouted i am
tempted to seek your number

  but yuri held up a restraining hand
  quiet for lilias sake he implored

i do not blame you for i am deserving
of censure but hear me out hear how
i plan with your aid to atone for my
crimes

  just as my suit was progressing ad-
mirably you-myles cabot-arrived on
this planet and the plans of the depart-
ment of eugenics abruptly changed from
merely mating the two most beautiful cu-
pians to a really much more interesting
experiment with a strange new breed

  i shuddered and yuri smiled

  he went on at first i was jealous of
you and quite naturally so satan was a
particularly loyal henchman of mine and
it was my influence that fostered and per-
petuated his original hostility toward you
but now satan is dead so let the past
stay gone i no longer bear you any ill-
will for i have seen that the princess
lilia is even more averse to the stranger
from minos than she ever was to her de-
voted cousin so now i am willing to take
a chance on you as a rival and enlist
your support and assistance in my efforts
to rescue our beloved princess from the
formians and return her to her own
country

  all this he hurriedly told me in the
room into which he had dragged me of
course i was horrified at the part which he
had played but appreciating his change
of heart i assured him that i was willing
to help him rescue the princess

  then he outlined his plans

chapter ix

the rescue

the idea was for yuri to return to
cupia as that would make the ant-
men less suspicious ever since the depart-
ment of eugenics had changed their plans
with respect to the princess yuri had
been carefully watched for fear that he
would do the obvious thing and try and
return her to cupia in fact although he
had made up his mind many days ago to
enlist my support yet he had been so
closely shadowed that it was only now
that he had been able to make my ac-
the radio man



quaintance and snatch a few hurried words
with me and even now every moment that
we spent together rendered the danger of
our detection just so much more imminent

  on my return to cupia he said i
shall wait at the third gate where the
guard will be duly bribed to let you
through if you should succeed in reaching
it of course the formians will trust lilia
much more freely with myles cabot than
they would with prince yuri due to their
intense desire to perpetuate the race of
minos so you will have plenty of op-
portunity to convey these plans to lilia
and to arrange for her flight

  all the details have been carefully
thought out i will leave my kerkool be-
hind at the kerkool-ool at wautoosa for
you to use

  one of the city gates opens directly
from the kerkool-ool onto the main
traveled highway and the guard there is
a henchman of mine who has already been
instructed to let you pass i have even had
the forethought to prepare a forged pass-
port which will get you and liila safely
by ant-men who might see fit to stop you
and question you on the road

  i assented to all these arrangements
how glad i was of an opportunity to be
of service to lilia yuri might be willing
to take a chance with me as a rival based
m the well known fact that the princess
had greeted me with horror at our first
meeting and had with difficulty been in-
duced to associate with me even after
my triumphant return from mooni with
my means for radio communication but
yuri did not know how splendidly we had
been getting along together during the past
few sangths and i thought it just as well
not to tell him here was a chance to do
a favor for princess lilia and at the same
time free myself from my ant captors

  so i assured yuri that i would cooperate
to the utmost

  we patted each others cheeks to bind
the bargain and then he first and i a
few minutes later sneaked out of the room
without either of us being observed

  i hastened to the quarters of the prin-

cess and told her the entire plan to which
she gladly agreed

  a few nights later it was an easy matter
for lilia and me to meet by prearrange-
ment at the city kerkool-ool with my
false antennae and artificial wings i looked
very much like a cupian as it was and
with the addition of automobile goggles
which the kerkool-oolo keeper supplied
me i would have been willing to challenge
any one to tell me from the genuine
article

  yuris kerkool was very similar to the
ant mans kerkool in which i had returned
from my ill-fated bee hunt but it was
smaller and provided with seats very much
like those of an earthly automobile this
was a great relief as it was very tiring to
drive a kerkool standing up as is the
habit among the an-men

  we settled outselves in the car thanked
the attendant and soon were on the open
road headed for the cupian boundary and
freedom

  thus far our plans had been carried
out like clockwork and yet this fact made
it seem all the more likely that there was
trouble ahead i was filled with suspense
and excitement and evidently my com-
panion was under much the same strain
for she clung to my left arm with both
her little hands i could feel her heart
beating heavily and rapidly against my
side and every now and then she would
shiver although the night was warm i
longed to draw her to me and comfort her
but the kerkool demanded all my atten-
tion and besides she was a princess of
the royal house of cupia and i-why
i was probably merely an educated animal

  yet her intimate presence thrilled me
and her confiding trust gave me courage
to face any dangers no longer was she
the haughty regal princess she was now
merely a very frightened little girl and
manlike t gloried in my protective
strength

  it was a long time since i had taken
an automobile ride with a girl the night
was warm and moist and fragrant as are
all nights of poros i had not been 


famous fantastic mysteries

drinking man on earth and on the planet
venus i have never chewed the saffra root
but i can wish for no more intoxicating
and exhilarating experience than that ride
through the warm fragrant velvet black-
ness of the porovian night with my prin-
cess snuggled close at my side

  there wasnt much opportunity for con-
versation however for i was such a novice
with these machines that i had to keep
pretty much of my entire attention on
the control levers and on the road ahead

all went nicely until at one turn of
the road i saw a formian standing
ahead of me holding up one paw as the
signal for us to stop so i halted the ker-
kool

  who are you he asked

  but i had already prepared the replies
to such an expected catechism and so
answered readily enough we are jodek
and janek students at the university of
mooni now bound for the royal univer-
sity of cupia

  jodek and janek being two very common
names on poros like smith and jones on
the earth

  this road does not run from mooni
said the sentinel but rather from wau-
toosa and i well know that there are no
cupians at wautoosa

  then that very piece of knowledge of
yours i countered should convince you
that we are not from wautoosa as a
matter of fact we are from saltona-
which was the name of the farming village
where i had hunted the whistling bees-
where we were sent by the university
authorities to study a new breed of green
cows which has been produced there we
left saltona early this morning and came
through wautoosa about an hour ago see
here is our pass

  and i showed him an official formian
pass signed by one of the council of
twelve and authorizing jodek and janek
with one kerkool and their baggage to
leave the country by the third gate

  so far as i could see there was not the
slightest flaw in my story nor even any-

thing to arouse his suspicion but evidently
the ant man thought differently for he
proceeded to question me in detail
whose kerkool is that

  this was a question which i had not
expected it suddenly occurred to me that
as this was yuris kerkool it might bear
some identifying royal insignia which i
had not noticed and yet it would probably
be unwise to admit that it was his for
such an admission might suggest to an
intelligent sleuth hound such as my in-
quisitor seemed to be that my companion
might be the princess lilia

  what seemed a happy inspiration came
to my mind and i answered this ker-
kool belongs to prince toron of cupia
now assigned to the same department in
which we have been studying at mooni
and what department may that be
agriculture of course

  is that how you came to be studying
the cows

  yes

  i heard lilia gasp and felt her hands
tighten convulsively on my arm evidently
i had made some misplay

  several more questions he asked at
which i got more and more rattled

  then abruptly he said there is some-
thing wrong here for some unaccountable
reason i suspected you from the first and
evidently my suspicions were correct your
passport is invalid it is dated three days
ago and purports to be signed by no -
- yet he ceased to be a member of
the imperial council over a sangth ago
then this is not the kerkool to which i
have been accustomed as prince torons
you see i am recently from mooni myself
prince toron is assigned to the electrical
and not the agricultural department and
anyhow they dont teach about cows under
the head of agriculture accordingly your
entire story breaks down and i shall be
compelled to hold you until i can notify
my superiors you see-

  i saw all right and i didnt intend to
permit him to finish his harangue so while
his attention was still directed upon his
owr	-nion of himself as a detective
the radio man



i threw the car into full speed ahead thus
putting an end to the sentrys conversation
in fact it nearly put an end to the sentry
himself but instead of having sense
enough to run him down i instinctively
steered around him

  of course he immediately gave the
alarm and soon lilia informed me that
she could see the lights of a pursuing
kerkool behind us on the road

  then i began to have difficulty with the
controls of the car tt started to wabble
uncertainly although it did not decrease
its speed

  do you understand these machines
 asked

  yes she replied i frequently have
driven one

  what seems to be the matter with it
now

  she thought a moment intently and then
answered it seems to me that the gyro-
scopes are slowing down if this be so
we must come to a stop directly or the
kerkool will overturn

  i decided to take her advice and so
stopping the kerkool as quickly as possible
we each seized a small spotlight with which
the car was equipped and struck off into
the dense woods that lined the road

  a few moments later i heard the pur-
suing car crash into our deserted one i
had hoped that my maneuver might effec-
tively wreck our pursuers but apparently
it did not do so for soon i heard sounds of
ant-men following us through the wood

  as we were not using our lights they
could not follow us by sight and as we
were not talking they could not follow us
by sound for of course they could hear
nothing but radiations from our antennae
regardless of how much we crashed through
the underbrush luckily i thought of this
and so did not waste any time in trying
to be noiseless

the sound of the ant men grew fainter
and fainter behind us until suddenly
we stumbled into a network of ropes it
was an old and stale spiders webu- im-
mediately a bright idea occurred to me

and flashing on my light i hunted for
and found the spiders cave and into it
i led the princess

  the tunnel of the spider was about four
feet in diameter i crawled ahead on my
hands and knees and the princess followed
me

  theyll never think to look for us in a
deserted spider nest said i in a low voice
and was just about to add some more
reassuring words when lilia broke in with
quick myles theres something following
us 

  get behind me i cautioned as i
hurriedly wheeled and crawled past her

  true something was following us down
the passage i switched on my flash-light
and found myself face to face with a huge
spider so the nest had not been deserted
after all

  the spider steadily approached i held
my ground and lilia cowered behind me
one touch of his horrid spit meant certain
death as i well knew and yet how could
i combat him at least i could die fight-
ing

  and when he had killed us both there
was the satisfaction of knowing that yuri
would never learn what had become of us
and would always picture us together
somewhere safe from his clutches and
who knows but perhaps he would be right
if god had provided the same heaven for
both cupians and earth folk

  all these thoughts ran through my head
in much less time than it takes to set
them down here and then i prepared to
defend myself or rather to defend the
beautiful creature who depended upon me

  i had no weapon i did not even have
anything to use for a weapon except the
folding umbrella which hung at my side

  these umbrellas are of a very light but
strong construction the ribs and handle
are made of alloy steel of a great springi-
ness the covering is remarkably opaque
silk cloth when open they are about four
feet in diameter and closely resemble an
ordinary parasol such as we have on earth
but when closed they are scarcely larger
than a rolled-up copy of famous fan-


famous fantastic mysteries

tastic mysteries

  accordingly in the folded condition in
which it hung at my side it was not likely
to prove of much value for defensive pur-
poses so i endeavored to extend it to
its full length and had to open it first in
order to do so the opened umbrella en-
tirely filled the tunnel with its point to-
ward the spider and its handle toward me
in an instant i realized that i had effec-
tively blocked the way against my adver-
sary

  the umbrella although not much good
as a sword might prove quite valuable as
a shield

  and so it turned out the spider hurled
himself against it rending the silk cover
but driving the ends of the ribs firmly
into the walls of the passageway the
spring steel proved strong enough to with-
stand his onslaught so lilia and i with-
drew out of reach of his legs and waited
further developments

  we had not long to wait for soon we
heard the radiations of ant-men outside
the entrance

  they must have gone in here said
one for it is here that i saw their lights
flash and heard the scream

  a light appeared at the opening and i
could see that the spider had turned
around and was now facing the other way

  evidently our pursuer could see this
too for one of them remarked the spider
has got them cooped in there come you
keep his attention diverted while we go
around behind him and dig them out

  i seized lilia by the hand

  come on i whispered i dont know
where this tunnel leads to but let us at
least go down it as far as possible and
perhaps barricade ourselves with your um-
brella at the bottom

  so we resumed our crawl the way
seemed endless but the further we went
the more my spirits brightened

  princess i said it is very likely that
they will miss the tunnel in their digging
or if they find it they will have the
spider to cope with for he seems to be a
wild species and not the domestic kind

which the formians keep to guard their
herds of aphids or if they get by the
spider they may hesitate to crawl through
a dark tunnel come on

the air smelled stale and musty but
at last to our surprise began to get
fresh again and then the ground felt
rough under my knees a twig snapped
and i found that i could stand erect we
were out in the woods again and no
formian pursuers within sight or earshot

  close beside the exit was a thicket of
tartan bushes that plant with the large
heart-shaped leaf so beloved of the purple
grasshoppers

  the safest place for us i whispered
will be right here by the mouth of the
tunnel if they do follow us through they
will never think to look for us close at
hand and the thickness of the foliage
will prevent their discovering us accident-
ally

  so together we plunged into the center
of this bower of hearts then we lay down
and listened

  presently we heard voices at the mouth
of the tunnel and i heard the crashing of
the ants in the underbrush but so thick
was our leafy covering that we could not
catch even a glimmer of their spotlights

  their voices became fainter and fainter
in the distance and at last we knew we
were safe at least for this night but as
their conversation died away another
sound came to our antennae the distant
howl of a woofus answered from another
quarter by the cry of his mate lilia shud-
dered at my side as we listened to this
new menace grow nearer and nearer

  but at last this too died away and
when my straining ears could no longer
catch the slightest sound of it i was sur-
prised to find that i was holding the prin-
cess clasped tightly in both my arms

  she too noticed where she was and yet
made no effort to draw away

  i was so frightened myles said she
softly you will take care of me wont
you dear

  for answer i held her closer she heaved
the radio man



a little sigh and like a tired baby nestled
down to sleep in my arms

  and thus all through the perfumed
tropical night i held and watched over
the beautiful creature who had made life
on poros mean more to me than it had
ever meant on earth

  gather ye rosebuds while ye may i
thought for she is the princess royal of
all cupia and you for all that the pro-
fessors have decided may not be even
human

  the fairy orchestra of the wood grass-
hoppers played its sweetest wind-bell
tunes which earthly ears alone could hear
delicate fragrances crept in on an occa-
sional little breeze the night was velvet
soft and in my arms lay sweetly breath-
ing in perfect peace and trust the dearest
being any world could hold

  thus we lay in our bower of leafy
hearts until the invisible sun rose over
poros the next morning when lilia finally
awakened it was with the sweet dewy smile
of a little child

   i kissed her lightly on the cheek and she
smiled again and said you are very good
to me myles cabot better than i de-
serve who treated you so

  it is morning my princess said i
and we must be on our way

  she gave a slight shudder that is so
she regally replied i am a princess

  the spell was broken and we arose and
set out together through the wood travel-
ing due west for we had left the road on
the east side the night before in this way
i hoped to reach the road again and con-
tinue along it to the border we were able
to tell the points of the compass in the
early morning light owing to the pinkness
of the eastern sky and the darkness of the
western

  reaching the road in safety we set out
northward along it i blessing my sense of
hearing which enabled me to keep a keen
ear out for approaching kerkools each
one of which we dodged by hiding in the
woods at the side of the road

  in this manner we kept on without fur-
ther adventure for the entire day slaking
our thirst at am occasional brook and
staving off hunger by means of certain
edible plants with which the princess was
well acquainted

  at last on topping a slight rise we saw
before us a long wall stretching away out
of sight in the distance to both right and
left

  is this the pale of which i had heard
so much i asked

  it is lilia replied and beyond it

lies cupia and safety look i directly be-
fore us at the foot of the hill is the third
gate

with a cry of joy we rushed down
the hill hand in hand together
sure enough there stood yuri talking with
the cupian sentinel just beyond the gate
stood a kerkool

  yuri greeted the princess respectfully
and assisted her into the car the sentinel
offering no objection

  but as i sought to follow her the senti-
nel stepped before me and drew a short
broadsword which he held menacingly in
his hand

  yuri i called this guard wont let
me pass please tell him that it is ail
right

  yuri turned around in his seat in the cat
and gradually a mocking smile spread over

his features then he spoke to the sentinel

  i dont know the fellow he declared
erobably he is an escaped cupian slave
you had better arrest him

  the princess shrieked yuris car shot
ahead and they disappeared northward
leaving me stunned and hurt staring after
them

  perhaps i could have argued it out or
even fought it out with my bare hands
with the cupian sentinel but at that
minute a formian sentinel emerged from
the guardhouse at the gate to take his
tour of duty together the pair seized
and shackled me and placed me in a cell

  thus just as my hopes had been highest
they were dashed to the ground here was

a real sunken city

rithe lost city of letalimem rumor has it did actually exist but now it has
sunk beneath the sea in ordinary daylight one can actually see the outlines
of this once populated city lying sixteen fathoms deep beneath the waves

  wonderful stone pillars they say gigantic monoliths and marvelous carved
stone arches can be observed rumor also says that the japanese govern-
ment which owns the carolines will allow no men or ships of foreign nations
in the neighborhood and in addition maintains great secrecy pertaining to the
sunken city

  it is believed by scientists that relics of a once mighty empire are hidden in
the ruins exactly what they are has not yet been admitted it is said that a
house of the dead has apparently been discovered which is reported to contain
 bodies in platinum coffins

  when at last the jealousy of nations is ended and the scientists of the world
ire allowed access to metalimem the truth that will be revealed will probably
confirm the actual existence of sunken ancient cities like the one in a merritts

as the people of the twentieth cen-
tury had crowded the docks at the
sailing of great ocean liners so
now in the latter years of the twenty
second did they swarm to the broad paved
fields in the center of which in an endless
line stretched the launching pits of the
space rocket liners

these travelers of the freezing outer
spaces stood glistening in the sun their
conical tops reared proudly to heights of

 a thousand feet or more their silvery sides
 were lined with observation ports but were
 otherwise smooth except for the scant
 dozen hooded openings used for navigation
 only strong sharply cut atmospheric
 vanes with the electronic nozzles at their
 tips were spaced at regular intervals at
 their sides

   they presented a spectacle of majesty
 confidence-the highest pinnacle of mans
 achievement-and some of this impressed

itself on the sea of humans which fluttered
with handkerchiefs and bright ribbons or
banners contributing to the general ani-
mation

  the young man who skirted the edge
of the crowds had no eye for the beauty
of the scene however he was hardly more
than a boy just twenty-two and he was
on his way to the freight pits still a good
half-mile away where the squatty busi-
nesslike space tramps were discharging or
receiving cargoes

  syl webbs object was to get a job at
which to make a living since the income
left him by his father had been swept
away by the new taxes but he had another
and greater object-to prove for himself
the manhood which had struggled vainly
for expression in his pampered life as a
member of the leisure class

  he arrived at length at the end of the
glistening new vitricate-paved way and
the small truck which had been dogging
his footsteps came to a determined stop
its chimes sounding insistently persons
who passed the boundaries could not ex-
pect porter service syl placed a coin in
the slot the machine said kyou re-
released the elegant trunk to its owner
and turned back

  syl passed several of the rusty or black-
painted ships carrying the trunk on his
back until weariness forced him to put it
down and sit on it a calculating-looking
petty officer chancing to see him left
his toilers and accosted him

  lookin for a job hey

  yes sir

  y dont look very strong

  syl flushed he was of medium build
well-knit and the tanned legs under his
short breeches were well developed but
in comparison to the others powerful
figure he seemed almost puny

  i can work sir

  where y get them duds

  why theyre my regulars
aw-gawan thems capitalist duds
he was filled with the vast scorn of the in-
dustrial class for members of the coupon-
clipping aristocratic capitalist caste

  i am-well-i was a capitalist

  the other balled a big fist he suspected
he was being made fun of but syls evi-
dent refinement convinced him and a new
light glittered in his beady eyes and a
sneer came to his cruel hawk-like face
there was triumph in it and hate for
he had been born on the wrong side of
the ever widening social gulf

  so theyve taxed down one more of the
damn parasites good for the commission
well m fine lad youre hired

  so saying he reached out a powerful
hand and seized syls wrist with a deft
twist he forced syls thumb into a little
oval aperture of the sealograph strapped to
the officers waist a tiny camera inside the
device clicked and syl webb former
capitalist gentleman was legally made an
employee of the neptune  uranus trad-
ing co labor division

he new recruit looked puzzled
come on snap round his new
boss commanded get your duffel in an
report fer duty

  but i dont think i want to i want
to look around-

  so with a hoarse roar insubord-
nation well any damned time mark
gunning cant handle a mutinous ground-
slob-

  a cloud of fists descended on syl he
knew a little of the science of boxing--
was in fact quite proficient-but that
was not the same as the fighting of mark
gunning cargo master of the pleadesia in
a few seconds webb was lying on the
ground his head a mass of contusions
and coughing dizzily from a foul blow to
the throat

  with a stream of practiced curses gun-
ning picked up his victim and sent him
rolling and tumbling down the gangplank
toward a cargo door he picked up the
trunk and tossed it after its owner it
missed the plank and fell fifty feet to the
bottom of the pit where it split open in-
stantly half a dozen dust - and - sweat -
streaked men pounced on the gay-colored
synthetic silk shirts and the swank useless
the red germ of courage



harnesses of dyed leather donning them
in grotesque parody of pleasure - villa
nymphs they danced around under the
spouts until driven to their work again
by the curses of a port overseer

  syl lay inside the ship where he had
rolled at the bottom of a steep metal lad-
der his head had been cut by a sharp
projection somewhere and blood was be-
ginning to mat his dark wavy hair his
eyes were puffed shut and there were tears
in them-not tears of pain but tears of
mortification and anger somewhere under
the soft padding laid on his being by gen-
rations of genteel civilization stirred a
feral blind lust to go back up there-to
bite-to gouge-

  hurt lad

  though syl had been a recruit just a
few minutes the cultured accents sounded
strange to him with difficulty he opened
his eyes enough to see a man of about
fifty was looking through the square open-
ing in the floor above he was a small
man and rather thin his neck was
scrawny with a prominent adams apple
graying hair fringed his bald head and
his rather weak mouth was partly con-
cealed by a scraggly mustache white and
stained blue with merclite the intoxicating
chewing gum

  itll wear off the man said with a
sympathetic grin want to come up to
the galley im cooky here

  with assistance syl climbed the ladder
and after passing several doors reached
the galley fifty feet above the room was
wedge-like in shape with one end con-
forming to the arc of the outside shell un-
like the rest of the ship that syl had seen
so far it was scrupulously clean the cook
applied hot compresses to the bruises

  names splade he volunteered used
to be a capitalist like you they taxed me
down about ten years ago you get used
to it im a good cook-they admit it
and treat me pretty well forgotten most
of them have that i ever clipped coupons
but it may be a little hard on you lad

  a small bell tinkled and in an istant
splade dived to the floor carrying syl

with him before the latter could remon-
strate the floor came up as if trying to
crush him it was as if his weight had been
increased many-fold there was a dull
roaring which ceased almost immediately
and the abnormal floor pressure gradually
diminished

  it was a new experience to syl he had
traveled in the superbly engineered passen-
ger ships whose graduated acceleration
caused hardly any discomfort but this
expensive refinement was unknown on the
freighters

  splade grinned and rose were way
above the atmosphere hell bent for titan
sixth satellite of saturn going to stop at
the mines

syl shivered before this definite
sundering of the earth ties he had
entertained deep in his subconsciousness
some idea of desertion now he was irre-
vocably bound to the ship for at least four
months possibly longer depending on the
length of the stop at the mines

  like all space freighters the pleadesia
consisted of a large number of cargo com-
partments arranged compactly around a
central well which extended from the
bottom to the top ending in a hatchway
to the observation and navigating room
in the ships nose automatic mechanism
set to the proper co-ordinates attended to
the routine so that except for supervision
the presence of the officers was not really
necessary

  full details of the power rooms which
were located in the thick stubby vanes
above the electron-ejector nozzles were
shown the officers by selective televisor
tabs the navigator foci from the hooded
ports and the usual amplifying auditory
systems to all parts of the ship were pro-
vided them also in the top of the navi-
gating room at the very tip of the conical
nose was the emergency outlet

  below the navigating room were the
eight or ten cabins used by the officers
and occasional passengers below these
were the cargo holds galley hospital and

carry a doctor at the very bottom were
the laborers quarters the ship rotated
in flight and by centrifugal force generated
a fictitious gravity this enabled one to
walk up and down the sides of the well
ignoring the ladders when out in gravity-
less space

  syl did not descend to the crews
quarters until he had exchanged his tat-
tered silks for coarse fibroids fatigue
clothes loaned him by the cook a strong
bond had formed between them as rep-
resentatives of the small leisure class they
belonged to the doomed their kind were
ground between the upper and nether mill-
stones-the scientifically trained tech-
nicists and the laboring class

  if you say you came here to get a
job i believe you said the older man as
syl prepared to leave but tell me you
dont plan to be a mug do you

  syl thought of the brutalized crew and
shook his head

  you probably wont understand me
said the new recruit but i want to prove
my place in the world as a man ive done
nothing but useless things all my life ive
felt the futility of it-but like a fool i
wasted the time i might have been pre-
paring to be a technicist i could be wear-
ing the gold braid up above if i hadnt
but theres the records office

  syl laughed scornfully it was well
known to everybody in twenty-second
century civilization that the government
records office was a sort of pensionary
where those who had been taxed dowrn
could eke out a shabby-genteel existence
he had visited it once-had memories of
young-old men sticking useless pins into
futile maps of women bred for genera-
tions to lives of gentle leisure compiling
statistics that would remain unused

  yes i know the records office its
the governments way of saying what a
hopeless breed we coupon-clippers are
im going to prove theyre wrong if i get
killed for it im starting with the toughest
and the worst of them ill study and win
a technicists school appointment

  yes splade smiled sadly thats

what i thought but i was too old and
they found out i could cook yet there
was-class pride in his bearing as he
watched syl walk down the well

there were about twenty labor mugs
in the pleadesias crew they were
under the discipline of mark gunning
cargo master this by the way was not
a regular officers rating which perhaps
accounted for his bullying tactics yet if
his was a hard discipline the crew was
hard the labor mugs unskilled usually
physically powerful treacherous and wild
were the skimmings of half a dozen in-
terplanetary ports

  there was mnig tah the martian his
terrestial grandparents had helped colonize
that turbulent red planet a short quiet
man with tremendous limbs deep hairy
chest a habit of looking sideways at a
person addressing him he had the typical
swarthy complexion of the human martian
he was wanted for murder at marsumium
and wisely refrained from signing on for
any freight trips to his native planet there
were the four from the rio bias country
small lithe with quick white smiles as
they fingered their daggers behind their
backs even gunning feared them a little
and had made up his mind that something
would happen presently

  or wannol the lone representative of
venus-easy going indolent whose tre-
mendous arms could and did on occasion
break a mans back his thick skin flabby
even to the top of his hairless head was
burned a metallic bronze wannol believed
himself to be handsome and it behooved
others not to dispute with him

  but most of the mugs were earthmen
bred in environments of misery suspicion
and hate they rioted through life brawl-
ing most of them were wanted for some
crime or other but no one looked too
closely at the labor mugs they were es-
sential to this age of metal and of science
to do the hard dirty work which could
not be done more cheaply with machinery

  gunning set them to work scraping the
cargo holds which were to receive the con-

centrate at the mines syl webb was
paired off with a black named hoyden
a grinning hulking fellow clad by prefer-
ence only in a g-string

  you not vey big hoyden said in-
gratiatingly when they reached the hold
assigned to them take bucket me take
scrob with the toothed chisel he began
to scrape the scale off and as the stuff
loosened and fell to the curved wall-
flung there by the rotation of the ship-
syl wtebb picked it up and put it into
his bucket it was the first useful manual
work he had ever done in his life despite
his aches he felt almost contented

  the cordial relations between him and
hoyden did not last very long the big
negro soon begged for some merclite and
as syl had none not using the stuff hoy-
den became very much out of humor he
even started a backhand swing but syl
stepped aside and there was something
in his eyes suddenly gone steely-gray be-
tween their puffy lids that made hoyden
pause

  the twenty-four hour day based on
earth time was in force in the space lanes
when the far-away whine of the annuncia-
tor proclaimed eighteen oclock-six pm
old style-the men were marched down to
the mess room where food sent down a
tube in canisters awaited them begrimed
syl had begun to resemble his companions
there were some malicious remarks di-
rected at him which he thought it best
to ignore but mostly the men wolfed their
food and said little the talk veered to
a battle royal the night before with another
crew on one of the forbidden intoxicating
gas chambers that flourished under cover
and syl was forgotten

  he was very tired and sought the sleep-
ing cabin with its tiers of metal bunks
they were all more or less filthy but he
found one near the ceiling under an air
duct from the chemical plant he did not
hear the men quarreling all night over a
gambling game that derived from the old-
fashioned craps nor did he notice the
odor of mens sweaty bodies long uused
to water he slept as he never had before

  the next morning an order came down
from above for a man to polish the metal
work in the upper well

  get on up there you webb gunning
ordered  ats about all youre good for
y lazy swab he leered at the savage
faces got a loidy up there oh di-mi
gotta send up a reefined mug oh yeh
get on up there ybum

syl webb found some rags and polish
and left there was no one in the
upper well to direct him so he started to
polish the nearest bright surfaces the
ordered neatness here after the filth below
soothed him and at the same time filled
him with regret as he thought of the as-
sured young technicists of whom he might
be one

  they passed him by one by one
sprightly secu in their positions masters
of this complex mechanical age before
whose guilds even the few invulnerable
tax free capitalists respectfully bowed the
chemist the powermen the astronomical
mathematician passed on their way to and
from their stations as the watches were
changed and mug webbs polishing
strokes slowed as he thought of the times
when he on some passenger flyer had
sat at table as social equal of men such
as these

  following a handrail he came to a nar-
row lateral passageway ending in an ob-
servation bay the only one in the plea-
desia he caught his breath at the beauty
of the scene they were passing mars
on its sunward side it filled a quarter of
the unfathomable black space-vista by
contrast the reflected sunlight was dazzling
for once the incessant red dust storms
were absent and the canals like delicate
lacework could be seen unobstructed

  beautiful he exclaimed

  oh i love it

  beside him rapt eyes on the spectacle
stood a girl who put the beauties of the
celestial voids to shame she was about
twenty possibly a little less her slender
young body was wrapped in the gossamer
long robe of the era that concealed and


famous fantastic mysteries

yet maddeningly accentuated the delicate
feminine curves of her figure

  her uncovered head in its amber nimbus
of silky hair was thrown back she gazed
at the spectacle under long lashes that left
her eyes dark blue deep in shadows the
deep aesthetic emotion had brought bright
spots of color to her cheeks that in their
perfection defied the glaring light stream-
ing into the window

  beautiful she breathed

  very beautiful syl said devoutly
looking at her

  it always affects me the same way
she said theres no more lovely sight
in the solar system

  nor in heaven

  she turned smiling for she was not
unused to gallantry but when she saw
him her expression changed to horror her
white hand flew to her throat and she
stood as if paralyzed for a moment then
she was gone

   syl was puzzled then the realization of
his position came to him for a moment
he had forgotten that he was no longer
an aristocrat but a mug how his bruised
unkempt appearance must have shocked
her

  in a bitterly unhappy mood he finished
his task then sought out splade in his
galley to tell him what had happened

  the little cook surveyed him with
horror a trickle of blue-tinted merclite
saliva running unheeded out of the corners
of his mouth

  you fool he blurted thats maida
stanley daughter of the chief technicist
at titan of all the fool things you could
have done why did you have to speak to
her man dont you realize youre a mug
now if she reports you youll spend
the rest of your life in the ore docks

  syl did not think of what would happen
if she reported him he thought of the
gentle line of her white throat in the
garish light of mars of the thrilled im-
pulsive words she had spoken to him he
thought long of her that night lying on
his metal shelf one arm over his stubbly
face

the next three weeks were the most
miserable and the most satisfying in
sylt hitherto protected life he resolutely
banished thought of the girl to the back
of his mind where her memory tormented
him only occasionally with conscious pur-
pose he identified himself with the mugs
became one of them in their rough ways-
even learned to think like them

  in the back-breaking hours of labor he
liked to think of his fight with naylor bey
the giant mazurian that first week nay-
lor bey had his own style of fighting he
tried to shove his wirelike whiskers into
syls throat as he held him in a bears
hug but syl evaded him time and again
cut him to pieces with scientifically spaced
punches knocked him bleeding into a
corner bey regarded him after that with
puzzled wonder and showed no resent-
ment splade who had received the de-
tails of that fight from one of the mugs
on an unauthorized visit to the galley
exclaimed enthusiastically as he taped up
a cracked rib

  youre showing em boy youre
showing em the mugs are moren half
for you oh if i was only your age

  syl webb smiled but said nothing a
little later swaggering down the well he
met mark gunning who accorded him
a grudging half friendly nod syl did not
go looking for trouble with all his flower-
ing self-confidence he had also acquired an
atavistic cunning to live long one must
not be too pugnacious

  he learned to play the mugs games
and to chew merclite in moderation a
goodly supply of this dangerous solace had
been smuggled aboard by a member of
the crew and was for sale he acquired
only a slight liking for the acrid heady
gum

  for the time being of necessity he put
aside thoughts of becoming a technicist
he had no books could not get any nor
did he know where to begin time enough
for that when he would be discharged at
the home port with a half years wages
in his pouch it was more entertaining
anyway to loll on his bunk and listen to
the red germ of courage



the wild tales of adventure of unrecorded
battles of shady deeds

  he began to feel a real fellow-feeling
for the mugs he well knew now how hard
it would be to rise from the stratum into
which they had been born and he had been
forced by circumstances

  he began to feel a vague resentment
against the ranks of the capitalists which
he had so recently quitted it seemed
natural to hate them and also in a differ-
ent way the technicists whose supercilious
superiority rankled in his heart

  they were no better than he just
luckier up there they posed around in
their brass and broadcloth while here be-
low were men just as good as they sweat-
ing in this filthy hole

  this resentment was a stage he would
outgrow for he knew at heart that the
technicists had studied and worked for
their rank but now he was not backward
in sharing his thoughts with the other
mugs and they replied in kind so it came
that salvader one of the rio bias men
arose from a whispered conference back
of a bulkhead and approached him

  we thought we have to keel you but
now maybe we no need he remarked
pleasantly

  syl webb felt a queer little thrill of
fear all eyes were on him-not unfriendly
not friendly either merely speculative
they were weighing in their minds whether
or not it would be advisable to kill him
weighing the question impersonally calmly
dispassionate

  no y cant get out the door mark
gunning remarked evenly interpreting
syls quick glance i got a squizzle he
held up a small ionic projector whose
sizzling beam carried death

  well what is the proposition syl
asked calmly

  you see salvader explained frankly
in ordinar case we keel you anyway
but for thees we need you for to get by
the interplanetary flying police we need
man weeth-weeth-

  eddication gunning supplied in
two days we hit the outer saturn guard

cant none o us fool them birds you
webb gotta get in the navgation room
put up a front-let em see y-talk to em
over radio

mutiny such things still happened
syl found himself accepting the
thought equably but deep within him pro-
test stirred the fate of the officers was
foregone

  going to kill the technies

  sure gunning grinned we can run
the ship some of the mugs have picked up
a bit heren there i can read the co-
ordinate tables we got all we need but
a front youre the front wear the old
mans brass speak the i f p when we
pass the outer guard well parabola back
to the inner lanes swing round saturn
y see to save power then plenty ships
plenty loot plenty-he looked around
at the glistening-eyed mugs-plenty
women

  syl was very close to death at that
moment mutiny murder and piracy he
had become calloused enough to view
brutality with a certain equanimity but
the vision of the girl in the mars-light by
the port came back with a rush swept
away the savage resentful mists of class
hatred with which he had deliberately be-
fogged his mind through a red blur he
saw the cynical leering face of mark
gunning the circle of predatory faces
with their calculating eyes

  as from a distance he heard his own
voice casual cool uh-huh and the girl
up above

  there was a roar of laughter approv-
ing understanding

  got your eyes on her already hey
the gyps a snaky bargainer hey gun-
ning grinned looking back over his shoul-
der he took syls hand and shook it his
grin changing to a sneer

  you shall have er fellow he prom-
ised after me

  syl tensed but he knew his one chance
of saving her lay in not resenting that
threat-yet

  admitted to the full counsel of the


famous fantastic mysteries

mutineers syl wondered that they should
take his acquiescence so much as a mat-
ter of course until he came to realize
that in their warped ignorant morality
such action was the most natural in the
world kill or be killed eat or be eaten-
that was the rule

  he had been spared for the sole reason
that he might be useful that he should
purchase his life at the price of a few
others was normal the only sane thing to
do in mug philosophy

  from the very first flash of understand-
ing his human decency had overcome his
sympathy for the mugs his course seemed
absurdly simply merely to report to the
captain warned the crew of eight tech-
nicists and the two officers stewards with
the highpowered projectors stored above
could easily overpower the mutineers and
hand them over to the interplanetary fly-
ing police when hailed by them

  but gunning was of the stuff of which
leaders are made on syls first attempt
to edge casually toward the technicists
quarters webb was suddenly pricked by
keen knife points in four separate places
on his back the rio bias men let him
feel the keenness of their weapons then
ironically stood aside to let him go back

  to keel you mister sir salvader
purred we would regret veree much
veree much we would regret him
gunning came out of a hold

  no use yer tryin to squeal or maybe
y wasnt

  of course not i was just looking the
ground over

  yeah gunnings beady eyes bored
into his own well y can find out more
in the cabin

  closely guarded syl was returned to
the crews quarters strong thin arm and
leg irons were clamped on him attached
to such short chains that he could not
lie down in the corner to which they were
fastened on space ships no waste space
is available for use as a brig-hence the
sleeping quarters are used and they are
bad enough

  cramped and uncomfortable as he was

syls misery was enhanced by the plan-
ning of the mutiny he could of course
heat every word and the lecherous refer-
ences to the lone woman passenger roused
him to rage yet he maintained his cynical
mocking attitude hoping they would re-
lease him while there was still time he
wondered if he could attract splades at-
tention splade did not mingle much with
the mugs he would therefore be loyal

  in fact he soon knew splade was loyal
for the little eurasian tiang was dele-
gated to kill him as the signal

  the plan of the mutineers was com-
pact and direct bell  about fourteen
hours hence was the time that would
be an hour before the changes of the
watch all on the ship would be sleeping
except the officers on duty tiang having
killed splade was to wait in the galley to
answer after a fashion any chance call
from above

  gunning hoyden and the martian tah
were to creep up to the navigating room
only one officer would be there-captain
kellerman himself epstan the mathema-
tician and cocky young arberson the
chemist would be sleeping and four of
the powermen

  that would leave two powermen on
duty one on each side of the ship in the
hooded cubicle from which he controlled
the propulsion jets onthat side the power
cubicles presented a real difficulty ac-
cording to the spatial acts they must be
locked on the inside only the captain and
the powermen on duty had keys and even
the captains key would not open the doors
if the powermen set the emergency bars

  the powermen once apprised of what
was happening through their televisor tabs
could cripple the ship and deliver it even-
tually into the hands of the interplanetary
flying police but because the powermen
could be depended on to be brave men the
mug strategists planned to use that brav-
ery

  if captain kellerman were murdered
tortured perhaps wouldnt these brave
young men dash out to assist him a sweep
of the hissing projector in the compara-
the red germ of courage



tive darkness of the well would dispose
of that question

the mugs awaited the fatal hour with
grim anticipation this was a desper-
ate game they were playing about that
they had no illusions failure or discovery
by the i f p before they could set up
the heavy projectors included in the cargo
to be used for the defense of the mines
meant only one thing-and it was un-
pleasant to contemplate

  a summary court-martial then a knot
of struggling men half insane with fear
forced into the airlock a few seconds of
silence after the thud of the inner lock-
then to be spewed instantaneously bloated
corpses tumbling falling free oozing blood
frozen on their skins-to swing for eternity
in their lonely orbit or to plunge into the
sun

  such was the fate of pirates caught in
the space lanes and the mugs knowing
approached their battle for a well-armed
ship and the prospect of possible years of
space marauding with a certain cold
ferocity syl was never left alone for a
second all of his simulated hope for the
success of the mutiny failed to win for
him a moments freedom

  y get yer chance when y speak the
i f p gunning told him grimly if
y as much as bat an eye-he touched
meaningly the small projector hanging at
his belt

  at last the annunciator whined out
bell 

  as silently as a panther pack of venus
the mugs faded from the cabin leaving
syl alone the door slammed he tried
violently as he had before surreptitiously
to release himself

  no use

  the mugs were armed with knives
clubs cargo hooks gunning alone had a
modern weapon treading softly they
started up the well walking on the sides
like flies for there was no gravity-only
the slightly centrifugal force of the ships
axial rotation tiang darted out f the
galley where he had crept shortly before

he whispered excitedly mark gunning
grunted

  nev mind well get splade with the
rest hell be up there somrs

  the cabins of the sleeping powermen
were unlocked furtive figures crept in a
little farther up was epstan his door
opened too letting in the gray light of
the well

  the massacre was over in a few seconds
acting with rehearsed precision the mur-
derers snapped on the light switches dis-
patched their victims while they were still
dazzled by the glare the lights were
darkened again and slinking figures with
dripping knives joined their fellows arber-
son happened to be in the chemical room
cursing the leaks he gave them a game
fight but he was soon overwhelmed

  gunning listened at the door of maida
stanleys cabin she was sleeping and
would keep till later one cabin door was
locked this undoubtedly held the all-
important controls of the heavy projectors
it also could wait

  overhead was the glassed grating of the
navigating room the old man was operat-
ing the automatic bearing connotator
gunning crept up the short ladder gently
he pushed the grating swinging it on its
pivots

  he had it half open when it creaked
slightly captain kellerman jumped up
overturning his chair he took in the situ-
ation instantly and leaped to the wall for
the projector hanging there but before
he could turn gunnings beam fell on him
the black hole through his body smoldered
as he sprawled on the floor

  gunning leaped off the ladder to sta-
tion himself at the well-head weapon
ready channing starboard powerman
leaped out of his cubicle roaring his rage
he was weaponless and gunning cut him
down without mercy

  up above was a slight commotion two
officers stewards had been found hiding
in a chest and several of the mugs amid
much laughter were dragging them to the
airlocks along with the bodies of the mur-
dered technicists fearing gunning no one

had touched the girl her white fright-
ened face had appeared at her cabin door
for an instant then she had locked her-
self in

  but helgrim the port powerman was
net only brave-he was prudent he saw
the murder of captain kellerman on his
televisor tab and like channing felt the
impulse to dash out of his locked cubicle
but unlike channing he had been a mug
himself before his long arduous climb to
his present position many mugs could
operate the power generator but few had
helgrims shrewdness that enabled him
to break into the close corporation of the
technicist guild

  instead of following his impulse to dash
to the rescue he paused with his hand on
the lock and listened a few moments
later faintly hearing the noise of the tri-
umphant mugs he took a long chance he
threw the port jets into full reverse

  it was a foolhardy thing to do oi ly
justifiable in this extreme emergency for
the tremendous strain might easily have
carried away the port vanes and the power
cubicle too

  under the terrific reaction of the elec-
tronic blast in which millions of horse-
power was expended in a few seconds the
huge ship flipped over and over before
he could remove his hand from the con-
trol helgrim was thrown against the roof
of his cubicle his desperate grip was torn
loose but just before he lost consciousness
he saw a blinding flash the activator
fuse had blown

  immediately the ships automatic course
director took charge again the auxiliary
circuit taking up the load and brought
the pleadesia back on an even keel but
helgrims desperate expedient as he had
hoped seriously disorganized the pirates
as they had all been in the forward part
of the well with nothing at hand to hold
on to they had been flipped about sixty
feet to land in a heap against the upper
grating salvaders skull was crushed and
some of the others were badly injured

  cursing and reckless in their rage they
began to assemble one of the heavy pro-

jectors to burn down the port power door
battering down the cabin doors in their
search for the parts they were risking
everything to gain speedy control of the
ship for they might very easily breach
a hole clear through the outer skin let-
ting their precious air escape into space

helgrims forceful methods had
done more than the mugs knew
they had shaken out from his burlap bales
in the hold next to the galley a rather
thin elderly man with graying hair weak
chin and pale blue eyes splade had taken
leave of his work before the regular time
and had been wafting gently among the
airy fantasies of a merclite dream

  weaving on unsteady legs he started
up the well toward the lighted grating
some three hundred feet away he saw
or thought he saw hurrying figures and
heard a great deal of noise

  he was almost within the lighted area
when he bethought himself of his condi-
tion guiltily he started back

  musn let a tec-tec-technie see me
like thish get a ticket for it probly

  a moment later as the ship yawed in
a course adjustment he was thrown off
his feet and tumbled a dozen yards further
toward the base

  mustve chewed too mush yes sir
man shouldnt chew too mush never
made me feel like thish before rotten
stuff theyre selling us nowadays

  communing with himself he brought up
at last against the dirt-encrusted base of
the long cylindrical hull

 hangedf it dont make me hear
things he exclaimed then for he thought
there had been a call for help beyond the
metal-studded door of the crews cabin
it sounded like syl webbs voice

  weak rage flared up in him

  nice boy he croaked if them so-
and-sos are horsin him fists raised in
what he believed to be a pugilistic atti-
tude splade kicked open the door and
staggered in

  leaning against the wall to which he
had been chained syl looked as if he had
the red germ of courage



been horsed very much indeed there had
of course been no opportunity for him
to be thrown as the mutineers had been
but he had been viciously shaken and the
blue light disclosed the ghastly pallor of
his face at splades appearance however
a flush of joy overspread his features

  splade get a key and take these irons
off me

  splade blinked let me at them mugs
he milled around with his fists

  splade syl strained at his chains
you fool theyre murdering the tech-
nics and the girls up there get a key-
take these things off

  the cook finally saw his friend tried to
bend over him fell on him instead syl
heaved him off impatiently but splades
senses were slowly rallying he drew a
hand across his eyes

  the key huh he muttered gun-
nings got it ill get it from him
no the younger man drew heavily
on his newly learned mug profanity
youll get knifed find a chisel and a
hammer cut the chain understand cut
the chain

  splade shuffled out to the tool room
he returned presently with a maul and
chisel and proceeded to cut one of the
chains  although the metal was light
hardly more than wire it was very tough
and time seemed endless before syls arm
was free save for the light metal cuff
there was the ever present danger that
one of the mutineers might come back

  syl wielded the maul after that splade
holding the chisel and under the formers
purposeful blows the three remaining
chains soon lay on the floor a mo-
ment later through the half-open door
they heard footsteps

uick shoving the shaking splade
into one of the higher bunks syl
leaped up to the next one here they were
a couple of feet over the heads of men
standing in the room they were barely
in time for four of the mugs crowded in

  foremost was wannol his wtinkled
bronze head flecked with tiny specks of

blood behind him were tweedy a rat-
faced little renegade from the clyde and
two coppery coarse-haired indians who
were naked save for torn strips of gold
braid ripped from the murdered techni-
cists uniforms blood-lust glistened in the
eyes of all

  says its under the bottom bunks
wannol rumbled get under there you
swabs 

  the others started to haul out a heavy
coil of insulated cable but in a moment
tweedy snapped defiantly upright

  an who are yew to order us round
he rasped

  wannol advanced ominously his enor-
mous shoulders hunched tweedy who had
seen that look before blanched his hand
slipped furtively to his belt to the hilt
of his curved thin-bladed knife but wan-
nol like a human avalanche enveloped
him there was a dull crackle a relaxed
sigh and the limp body of tweedy sank
to the floor wannol contemptuously
plucked the knife out of his fat shoulder
and threw it rattling on the floor plates

  now he growled looking at the
indians

  with little trace of their traditional
stolidity they bent their backs to the load
and staggered out of the door

  wannol started to follow them when
his glance suddenly rested on the severed
chain ends

  it was some seconds before his slow
brain functioned he glared around and
then his red-rimmed opaque brown eyes
fell on the crouching form of the missing
prisoner with a bellow he charged his
terrible arms upraised his inhumanly
powerful hands clutching talonlike for
the kill

  but they never closed on their victim
syl balanced himself on the edge of the
bunk drew up his powerfully muscled
legs and at precisely the right moment let
drive with all his strength his heavy-soled
work shoes struck squarely in the bronze-
mottled face of the man of venus with
all the power of his clean young body now
tempered and hardened by labor


famous fantastic mysteries

  the blow did not kill wannol for he
was extraordinarily tough but it stunned
him syl tied him with a short length of
cable that the indians had overlooked
then he looked out into the well

  at its forward or upper end he saw
knotted around a squat contrivance
mounted on skids with a large tube the
counterpart of the small hand projectors

  syl guessed correctly at the reason for
his recent shaking up the brave power-
man was shortly to be burned into eternity

  at that moment of realization a plan
sprang full-grown in syl webbs brain
a plan so utterly hazardous and foolhardy
that the best he could hope for if he suc-
ceeded was death-a swift and merciful
death for himself and the girl

swiftly and efficiently he stripped
tweedys body of his gaudy orange
fibroids picking up tweedys knife he
plunged into the well ran swiftly toward
the lighted part where the big projector
was ready to start those who glanced at
him thought he was tweedy for the light
was poor and their minds were on the
projector

  gunning sighted set the intensity con-
trol at low rack came the lever with
a roar like a giant blow-torch the projector
threw its powerful beam against the metal
door of the power cubicle in a few sec-
onds though it was heavily armored that
door would crumble like a rag the muti-
neers involuntarily retreated a few paces

  as they did so a figure separated itself
from them-a figure in gaudy orange
fibroids swift as light the narrow blade
leaped in straight to the lever slot in the
control box slashed into the delicate maze
of platinum wires there was an instan-
taneous flash and a ball of fire leaped
out the tube glowed white collapsed

  gunning and syl had both leaped to
safety

  youve killed us all gunning roared
snatching out his hand weapon he pointed
it at the supposed tweedy but sheer
amazement halted his finger on the but-
ton

  so you his weapon flashed-a
puny beam compared to the heat of the
self-destroying great projector the heat
was intense in the confined space syl
had not been hit his jump had carried
him to the forward side of the scintillating
mass and the mutineers could not even
see him

  back of him a door opened the heat
penetrating the walls had driven the girl
out there was a slight bruise on her
temple her face was pale but she faced
death with the courage of the finely bred

  syl threw off his cap and wiped his
grime-and-sweat-streaked face with his
sleeve she recognized him gave him a
brave smile with true instinct she guessed
the facts of the present situation she
offered no resistance as he led her up to
the grating into the deserted navigation
room

  that inescapable inferno would never
stop until the proton container was empty
long before then the ship would be but a
globe of molten metal

  the controls are shorted syl said
gravely to the girl no human being can
get close enough to throw the switch you
know what that means

  yes there was the barest possible
tremble in her voice as she looked him
full in the face

  unpremeditatedly reverently his arm
went around her lissome waist and he
kissed her once on the upturned mouth
then he would have released her but she
clung to him pressed her body against
his so that the delicate fabric of her robe
was soiled by the grime of him

  we have only a few minutes to live
she whispered i have thought of you
often since the day you spoke to me
though you frightened me hold me

  they moved over to the wall where
the terrible cold of space relieved the acrid
heat pouring in through the grating the
howl of the mutineers came to them

  animals exclaimed syl webb they
fear death they cannot die bravely

  who says brave the face of mark
gunning appeared over the floor edge he
the red germ of courage



was a horrible sight nearly all the cloth-
ing was burned off his body the hair was
scorched from his head he was a living
cinder his cracked baked skin smoldered
and gave off a sickening odor his sneer-
ing face shockingly seared beyond human
semblance was the face of a damned soul
rising out of hell

  who says brave shouted mark gun-
ning he held up his right arm charred
off at the wrist see that me mark
gunning-reached in there and turned it
off stuck my bare arm into the melted
metal n turned th bar who says
brave the womans mine

  hes dying syl murmured aside he
cant last hell drop dead in a minute
but the mug leaders immense vitality
would not let him die eyes glazed he
stumbled about the room vainly looking
for the girl the other mugs however
saved from death by gunnings super-
human bravado swarmed up the ladder

syl quick to avert the new danger
seized the girl and drew her up the
metal rungs to the peak of the chamber
under the emergency exit cap his hand
grasped the lever

  fire or come one step closer and
down comes this lever know what that
means well all pop out of here like a
cork out of a bottle understand one
step closer and were all dead men

  the mutineers understood they cursed 
they blasphemed but they dropped their
weapons their slow retreat became a
panicky scramble as syl shifting his
weight rested his hand too heavily on
the lever for a moment accompanied by
the hiss of escaping air it mattered not
that the same fate probably awaited them
as soon as the i f p ships appeared
they cringed before him now in a mute
plea for a few hours more of life

  but death approaching fast for mark
gunning granted him a brief respite his
filming eyes cleared and he saw syl webb
and the girl with agony in every move-

ment he stooped to pick up with his re-
maining hand one of the projectors
dropped by the mugs slowly with in-
finite effort he raised it until it was
pointed straight at syl

   at that moment a knife flashed through
the air from the group of frightened mugs
and buried itself deep in mark gunnings
throat as he slipped slowly to the floor
the dark red blood started dripping off
the knife handle

  the abject mutineers rushed forward
threw themselves on the floor

   we surrender they chorused

   syls voice was edged with disgust

   put the weapons back in the rack and
see theyre all there then get out

   he kept his hand up until the last man
had taken his hasty departure then he
held out his arms and maida slipped into
their embrace

  but in both of them was a primitive
respect for sheer bravery and when
splade came in quite sobered a few
minutes later and started to haul away
the charred body of mark gunning a
mutineer but a man of courage they
stopped him they covered the corpse
with a synthetite drape torn from the wall
before letting the cook bear it to the
airlock not until a few minutes later they
heard the dull thud of the locks closing
did maidas arms go around her lover
again

weird travel tales-

a chat with the skipper concerning clairvoyance
by bob davis

north german lloyd  columbus
off newfoundland banks-

it is the habit of sea captains to stroll
over the ship weather permitting from
ten to twelve am in this tour of in-
spection which is usually attended with
a mild display of ceremony the old sea
dogs are not averse to brief conversations
with such passengers as are up and about
the day was fair and captain ahrens
was in good humor

  what time to-morrow morning asked
a traveler should we pick up the nan-
tucket lightship

  about nine answered the sailor cock-
ing his meteorological eye skyward and
weather permitting that means the dock
at eight pm

  i asked the skipper if he had ever heard
the story of the soldier who returning
from the front on a troopship after the
armistice bet his bunkie five dollars that
he would never again see the nantucket
lightship no well the wager was made
about midnight in the dark and won at
daybreak

  i suppose the winner was clairvoyant
or thought he was guessed the skipper
ive known such cases at sea

  not this time i told him our soldier
wasnt dealing in second sight an hour
before he made the wager he was stricken
with blindness he had put his money on
a sure thing ironic but true

  umph grunted the man of the sea
that reminds me of a woman passenger
who sailed with us from new york
though perfectly well she took all meals
in her cabin declining to enter the dining-
room or come on deck it is perfectly use-

less said she for me to leave my state-
room the ship will not reach port as
this is to be my last voyage i have decided
to meet the end here do not attempt to
dissuade me this vessel is doomed

  the news of her strange decision spread
through the ship creating no little con-
sternation my suggestion that she appear
on deck and dissipate the harm she had
done met with her amazing and insistent
declaration that she was clairvoyant
and was she

  well the lady disembarked at south-
hampton and the ship continued to cross
and recross the atlantic without eventu-
alities of any sort in fact we are stand-
ing on her deck-now clairvoyance on
the columbus seems to be out of place

there was no reason why so enter-
taining a person as captain adolph
ahrens should be permitted to stop there
have you ever known in your experiences
at sea or elsewhere of an authentic case
of clairvoyance i asked

  yes and quite a remarkable instance it
was romantic in a way he smiled at
the recollection in my twenty-second
year i was second mate on the steel bark
amazon a wool carrier running between
london and australia at the time of
which i speak we were taking on a cargo
at melbourne where during a fortnights
stay i had fallen in love with an australian
girl by the name of mildred crawford
she was a sister of graham crawford one
of the leading journalists of australia
the affair reached the proportions of a
genuine courtship and i seriously con-
templated deserting the amazon for a

home on shore my sweetheart then six-
teen thought that reasonable delay would
be wiser than haste and i decided that
she was right

  on the following friday night we
sat in the park repeating our fare-
wells and talking of the future the
amazon all loaded but for a few bales
that were to be taken aboard saturday
morning when we would leave the dock
and anchor in the stream was making
ready to sail at high tide sunday morning
suddenly my intended turned to me ex-
claiming dont go aboard the amazon
will not leave tomorrow i laughed at the
idea but she persisted why do you say
that i asked because i see the amazon
submerged to her gunwales and still tied
to the pier said shenonsense i replied
and thereupon bade her good-by her last
act was to press into my hand a locket
bestowed with her blessing

  the next day saturday we completed
 our preparations and were getting ready
 to cast off and move out into the road-
 stead when a collier from newcastle com-
 ing to berth astern of us swung with the
 tide and smashed into our port plates
 almost instantly the amazon began to
 flood through her open seams and in half
 an hour we were lying on the mud with
 the cargo saturated we were hung up
 in melbourne for nearly a month making
 repairs and taking on a shipment of dry
 in place of the wet wool mildred didnt
 even say i told you so but the incident

 increased my respect for her clairvoyant
 powers

  in  i was given a ship that took
me into chinese waters and from that
time onward was advanced until i joined
the north german lloyd attaining in
 command of the columbus on three
different occasions after the amazon affair

i	returned to melbourne and each time
saw my first sweetheart who like a sensi-
ble girl had married an australian and
was raising a family i was a welcome
guest at her home and look back upon
those days as delightful memories it is a
curious thing but whenever my ship
headed for melbourne mildred crawford
knew a week in advance of my coming that
the german boy would soon arrive in au-
stralian waters her clairvoyant powers
never failed her no i cant say where
she is now but i wish her the best of
fortune

  would you mind telling me i asked
what was in the locket mildred gave you
that night in the melbourne park

  a slip of paper said the skipper re-
moving his cap respectfuly upon which
were written three lines

      if oceans wide between us flow
      and distance is our lot--
      dear dolph forget me not

  nor shall i forget her any more than i
shall forget the girl i afterward married
the mother of my children

  shes not a clairvoyant just a german
girl

  an astral gentleman

by robert wilbur lull and lillian m ainsworth

               he lived two mens lives one after the other
               and returned to court his wife all over again

pi

oor james had a most uncom-
fortable habit the last years he
lived of taking what he called
astral journeys

  how singular

  yes i often told him that-some day
hed come back and not be able to get
in-to his body i mean but hed never
listen was so sure of himself like all
men poor james

  my wife was softly rocking to and
fro as she sat by a window in the com-
fortable living room of a friendly neigh-
bors home as she rocked she gazed
sadly at a heap of ashes out yonder-
all that remained of our home-hers and
mine

  on a divan in a corner of the room
sat myself an uncanny guest invisible
to my wife and the neighbor to whom
she was talking

  my wife had never been in sympathy
with my occult investigations the un-
fortunate occurrence that had deprived me
of my physical body when i had con-
fidently expected to occupy it for many
years to come left her in the position
of being able to have the last word un-
challenged audibly at least no doubt if
she had been aware of my presence she
would have exulted i told you so
being absent at the time of the incident
referred to i had not been able until
now to learn the full particulars of it
i had been a deep student of occult
science for years and had startled and
interested my scientific friends on many
occasions by the nature of the phenomena
i had been able to produce i was a
natural psychic and being deeply in-
terested in these matters had developed
my powers to a remarkable extent as

stated by my wife i had become able
to leave the body at will and journey
to any place that i wished to go on the
earth

  a short time previous to the opening
of this tale i had been absent on a
more extended trip than usual when sud-
denly i felt the tiny cord which connects
the astral with the physical body snap
and realizing what it portended started
off swifter than the wings of light for
home

  too late when i arrived our house was
a mass of flames my distracted wife stood
by wringing her hands and my neighbors
whose attempts to remove my body from
the burning house had proved so futile
now witnessed the scene in despair

  i was in a badly disturbed state of
mina myself i fully realized that without
a physical body i should no longer be
able to manifest myself on the earth plane
and i was not yet prepared to enter higher
spheres to remain indeed i had no desire
to

  as i saw my hofne crumble to ashes
and witnessed my neighbors later in
their attempts to gather the charred frag-
ments of bone that had so shortly before
constituted my physical frame i had ample
opportunity to realize what a peculiar
and unpleasant predicament i was in

  i was in the strange and inconsistent
position of being a live dead man my
astral body which had gone out for a
little tour of investigation was from now
on to be a wayfarer in invisible realms
unless i could find some means of ac-
complishing a physical embodiment

  now a few days later i was an un-
bidden and unobtrusive visitor in the home
of the neighbor who had so kindly invited
my wife to share her hospitality after
the fire

  tell me just how it happened this
good lady was saying for the fifth time

  well you see james had gone to his
attic room where he was accustomed to
making these experiments it was late in
the afternoon the house was still as
death i thought as long as he was
traveling around the lord knew where
in his astral body i would just go over
for a little call on mrs lane all at
once my attention was arrested by the
sight of smoke pouring out the upper
windows of our house we were nearly
crazed with fright i was at least

  fire must have caught from the chim-
ney and got pretty good headway before
we saw it for it was too late to save
anything when we got help and reached
the house i screamed to the men that
james was asleep upstairs-i was sensitive
about his queer experiments-and they
rushed in to try to save him but it was
no use

  what id like to know added my
wife with a sigh is whether james sensed
danger and got back before the body
burned or whether he is wandering around
bodiless wishing he had taken my ad-
vice

  the latter was so true that i jumped
up to try to admit the fact but i fell
back disheartened what was the use
i had tried repeatedly to make my wife
understand i was present but my efforts
were perfectly futile she was utterly lack-
ing in supersensitiveness that enables
one to catch vibrations from the astral
plane i had always realized it now
i understood it with keen and peculiar
sorrow

  as a sense of the utter helplessness of
my position grew upon me a resolution
born of despair arose within me i would
find some means of once more expressing
myself on the physical plane if it took
years of study and effort to accomplish
it

  today i can look back with a fair
degree of calmness upon the experiences
i encountered before my purpose was
finally achieved

ii

the plan which i conceived and at
last accomplished was to hover near
persons who were taking final leave of
the physical and attempt to enter and
make use of the shell they were quitting
as one can readily see this was highly
impractical and after many futile at-
tempts i began to believe it impossible
for in almost every case when the body
is finally vacated it is because it is
utterly incapacitated either by disease or
accident for further use

  naturally i was somewhat particular
what sort of a body i found expression
in although of course one could not be
too critical in a case of this sort i finally
got to the pass where i was willing to
take up with almost anything i didnt
relish the idea of reincarnating in female
form for i was masculine to the core
then too i still held a lingering hope
that i might be reunited to my wife if
i accomplished my purpose

  hospitals became my favorite resorts
especially did i haunt operating tables
i clung to them with the desperate hope
that a drowning man clings to a plank
thrown out to him amid waters that
threaten to engulf him

  several times when i had become as
i thought securely ensconced in the frame
of a man who had gone out while under
the anesthetic i found myself compelled
in turn to vacate the powers of life being
too feeble to rally

  one instance i recall with especial vivid-
ness and the pang with which i realized
that i was again to be unsuccessful still
hurts at times

  the victim was a man of about my
own build handsome intelligent and of
a far more prepossessing appearance than
myself

  i judged him to be maybe a professional
man and i thought with a little thrill
of pride what a fine appearance i would
make could i secure admission to this
excellent specimen of humanity

  he was just undergoing an operation


famous fantastic mysteries

for appendicitis when i arrived i over-
heard one of the surgeons remark that
having been attacked so suddenly and
while in such fine physical condition
there was practically no doubt regarding
his surviving the operation splendidly

  i saw there was slim show for me but
having nothing especial in view i hung
around shadowed the poor chap until
they had the incision closed and every-
thing in shipshape condition

  all at once they discovered that the
heart was not doing duty properly i saw
his astral body leaving before the surgeons
realized that their patient was beyond
their poor human aid i watched my
chance cold-bloodedly if such a term may
be applied to one devoid of flesh and
blood but it was absolutely no use there
wasnt a ghost of a show for me in this
instance

  i felt rather guilty too as a man
might who was waiting to burglarize a
house as soon as its owner was out of
sight as i turned to go there stood the
mans astral body beside the operating
table and his reproachful look indicated
that he read my selfish purpose i ex-
tended my hand we shook and then we
parted

  after this experience i lost courage for
a time and i determined to abandon
hospitals i had discovered a fact that
surprised me somewhat-namely that
when hospital surgeons make a corpse of
a mans body it is usually in no condi-
tion for further occupancy

  for a time i wandered about miserably
staying for the most part near my poor
wife who was ever lamenting my sad
fate

  she had rented a little cottage near
the site of our former one and lived
there alone her evident loneliness moved
me to deep pity and i bitterly upbraided
myself for the needless misery i had
caused her

  existence became a curse i was of no
use in this world in my present condition
and was not yet ready to enter other
realms

  ill

iijad been in this unhappy state of
mind for several months when un-
expectedly a marvelous occurrence befell
me it was upon a wild stormy evening
in late autumn the wind howled dis-
mally rising into shrieks and wails dying
away into moans that sent children shud-
dering under the bedclothes and brought
to grown-ups visions of wrecks at sea
dead men shrieks of the dying and of
lost souls it was a night for ghosts to
walk	

  i wandered forth fit companion for
spooks but no friendly specter greeted
my forlorn gaze

  i had not traveled far when i espied
an inanimate human form lying limp upon
the wet earth his thin starved face turned
to the pitiless heavens a lamentable ob-
ject he appeared clothed in filthy rags
hair long and unkempt

  i discovered the body to be still warm
and found that life was just departing my
old desire for reincarnation gripped me
mightily but this revolting creature i was
sickened by its repulsiveness still beggars -
shouldnt be choosers and there was no
time to lose i must decide quickly

  decide i did quick as thought i took
possession of this house of clay that was
already stiffening in the rigor of death

i am positive this attempt would have
proved as useless as former ones had
if it had not been for the timely ap-
pearance on the scene of another specimen
uglier looking if possible than the one
whose body i was occupying he skulked
along through the wind-tossed shrubbery
near by head down fighting the wind
suddenly he halted

  hello pal he exclaimed with a start
espying his erstwhile companion in hoboism
prone before him what yer doin here
he knelt down and after a hasty ex-
amination produced from the recesses of
his tatters a bottle from which he poured
down the throat of his unresisting comrade
some of the vilest whiskey it had ever
been my lot to taste
an astral gentleman



  its effect however was magical burn-
ing its way into the system it soon set
the vital machinery in motion slowly
and spasmodically at first but with in-
creasing regularity the heart resumed its
beating the lungs commenced once more
their function the numbness and rigidity
of the limbs wore away by degrees the
body that i had so surreptitiously ap-
propriated was going to live

  i was so elated i nearly shouted for
joy

  the erstwhile owner of this disreputable-
looking organism must have been well
satisfied to dispense with it for he didnt
show up to dispute my claim and hence-
forth i called it my body and uncouth
and repulsive as it was i was mighty glad
to have it to call my own

 with the aid of my companion i
struggled unsteadily to my feet my in-
sides were still aflame with the rank
potion i had swallowed and i was weak
and trembling from fatigue hunger and
exposure

  my rescuer half dragged and half car-
ried me to a rude shed near by in which
hay had been stacked here with rough
tenderness he made me a comfortable
resting-place then he left me for a while
coming back later with a pocketful of
fresh ggs and a pail of warm milk he
had stolen a pail and milked a cow in
a neighboring farmyard and robbed the
nests in the farmers hen-house but i
blessed him for it

  i had the lions share of the spoils
and my comrade watched with evident
satisfaction my returning strength he
was a taciturn fellow and not used to the
little courtesies of life i wanted to ex-
press my gratitude to him but when i
attempted to thank him in words that
seemed fitted to be used to a man who
had just saved my life and done more
for me than he could ever realize he
looked suspicious

  nutty he inquired sarcastically
can it and go ter sleep

  whereupon i meekly burrowed ijato the
hay and pondered over the first difficulty

i had met with this tramps body was
no place for an astral gentleman that
was sure i must either adapt myself
to the body or adapt the body to my
real self i finally fell asleep and slept
soundly till morning

  as i awoke the strangeness of my situa-
tion slowly dawned upon me i must plan
a course of action before the man who
was snoring loudly by my side awoke
i began to realize keenly the truth of a
well-known and generally accepted fact-
the influence bodily conditions exert upon
the mentality

  my system was craving its morning
grog and almost making me believe it
really required it perhaps it did the
habits of years are not easily overcome

  i tried to decide what to do should
i sneak out carefully desert my com-
panion clean up and straightway begin
my new life or should i stay with him
and hit the hoboes trail for a few days

  my soliloquy was cut short by the ap-
pearance of a farmer and his hired man
who came with forks to carry hay to
their stock near by i followed a sud-
denly impulse and asked the farmer if
i might work and earn my breakfast
he looked me over from head to feet

  youre a pretty tough-looking speci-
men he ejaculated but youre the first
one of your kind thats offered to work
for a meal of victuals in the last six
months come on

  whats chewin yer inquired my in-
dignant pal in a venomous stage-whisper
yer must be dippy for fair ill wait at
the cross road and dont be long cornin
my partner was evidently in evil mood
his slumbers had been disturbed by the
appearance of the farmer furthermore
something in my bearing and manner of
speech seemed to fill him with astonish-
ment not unmingled with disgust i al-
lowed him to go his way while i followed
the farmer

the next hour was as hard a one
as i ever experienced my physical
body was weak and emaciated from lack


famous fantastic mysteries

of proper nourishment and from irregular
habits and dissipation my astral body
was ill fitted to such a garment i was
fighting these difficulties in an effort to
earn a decent breakfast after what
seemed an interminable length of time
the morning chores were finished and we
went to the house where i was given
an appetizing and nourishing breakfast

  imagine if you can what food tasted
like to a man who had wandered about
for weeks with no body with which to
assimilate it no doubt when the spirit
reaches the pure realm which is its final
destination the desire for creature com-
forts will vanish but my case had been
entirely different

  i had been living amid earthly scenes
as truly as when clothed in flesh but
with no vehicles through which to partake
of them i had been an outcast from my
own fireside a silent spectator at my own
table i had been neither seen nor in
any way recognized by those dearest to
me and had i been able to manifest my-
self to them i should have only struck
terror to their hearts

  surely not an enviable predicament

  after breakfast i told my new friends
that i had decided to turn over a new
leaf and implored their assistance i
proposed they help me to clean and
respectable clothing and a bath hair-cut
and shave i entreated them so earnestly
and promised so faithfully to repay them
in labor that after holding a family
council they consented

  the transformation in a personal ap-
pearance at the end of an hour was mag-
ical i began to have more courage re-
garding my future my gentlemanly bear-
ing and evident zeal and determination
to clean up and earn an honest living
made a favorable impression and wakened
sympathy in the warm hearts of these
good people whom i had been fortunate
enough to find and they did everything
possible to help me i stayed with them
some time working at hard manual labor
i was ill-accustomed to

  but i encountered struggles more severe

than i had expected my body had been
the home of a degenerate idle and be-
sotted creature for years the organs were
deranged and weakened from ill nourish-
ment and poor whiskey filth slothful-
ness and evil habits had placed their
curse upon what had once been the fair
temple of a human soul i had never be-
fore realized how closely is the physical
allied with the mental and spiritual

  with a courage born of despair i set
about to overcome these difficulties and
prove that the real man can surmount
almost any bodily condition if he makes
a superhuman effort

  i was becoming fairly well accustomed
to my new body and found it serving
my purposes admirably while i could not
hope to alter the physiognomy to any
extent yet one looking in my face might
have said it is the same yet not the
same it is illuminated from within by
intelligence purpose and ideals that are
worth while a different character shines
through

  certain physical changes had also been
wrought thus does the astral find ex-
pression through the material it is a
truth that is little understood by the
majority that our physical characteristics
are expressed in the astral before they
become visible in the material

  i began to have an uncontrollable de-
sire to visit my former home and renew
my companionship with my wife my
astral wanderings on the night i had
found the tramps body had taken me a
long distance from home one can travel
immeasurably longer distances when un-
encumbered by the physical body than
when they are so hampered and i now
realized that i was once more subject
to my former limitations

  time and space are so differently
sensed by astral dwellers than by those
of the material plane that i found it
difficult for a time to adjust myself again
to earthly conditions i had traveled long
distances with almost the rapidity of
thought never considering the localities
i passed through mental concentration
an astral gentleman



on the point i had wished to arrive at
had been the prime requisite in reaching
it now i must submit to the limitation
of the flesh

  i was even dependent on an atlas to lo-
cate myself and learn the distance to my
former home and the most direct route
by which to reach it i found it to be
several hundred miles distant and as i
was short of cash the means of covering
the distance proved a genuine dilemma i
was determined however to let no ob-
stacle deter me from my purpose so ob-
taining a bicycle i set out

  at the end of the first days journey
tired hungry and covered with dust i
stopped at an inviting looking cottage on
the outskirts of a village it was here that
i received one of the surprises of my life

  a man who was the physical counter-
part if myself sat on the veranda smok-
ing when he saw me his pipe dropped
breaking in a dozen pieces and with a
bound he reached my side i had barely
dismounted from my wheel before he
grabbed my hand

  why dave old boy he cried can
it be you back home once more nellie
he shouted to a woman standing in the
doorway you remember dave my twin
brother who ran away from home ten
years ago

  of course i do she replied hastening
to my side and grasping one hand while
the man held the other in a viselike grip

  but i am not your brother i pro-
tested whereupon they looked at one an-
other wonderingly then turning to me
they began to ply me with questions

  arent you david lawrence dont you
remember me your brother john

  no i am james rogers and i never
saw you before

  oh david dont you remember father
and mother they were nearly heartbroken
when you went away

  no i guess you must have mistaken
your man

  have you been ill have you lost your
memory

 not that i know of	

  they looked at each other knowingly
and at me pityingly i realized my resem-
blance to the man before me and it
dawned upon me that he was probably a
brother of the tramp whose body i was
parading in they evidently considered
this a case of mental aberration and nat-
urally i could not very well explain the
situation i decided that the best thing i
could do was to let them think as they
pleased

  i was invited into the house and my
needs ministered to with the tenderness
one naturally shows to loved ones suf-
fering from illness or misfortune i had
planned to spend the night here and press
on in the morning but a conversation i
overheard after retiring changed my plans

  poor dave the man was saying he
has lost his memory entirely hasnt he
he doesnt seem to recall a thing that oc-
curred before he left home and either
doesnt remember or doesnt care to tell
what hes been doing since im afraid its
the latter for he was pretty wild and dis-
sipated before he went away

  ive read of such cases said the
woman but sometimes they are cured
if they have the right treatment

  we must lose no time dr richards
the noted specialist on mental diseases
shall be consulted in the morning if we
can get an appointment with him i think
we should send dave to the doctors pri-
vate sanatorium if we can arrange to do
so

  and so they talked and planned until
i began to think i had best make good
my escape while i could

  accordingly i dressed quietly and slip-
ping cautiously to the window dropped
to the ground found my bicycle and made
a hasty exit from the town weary as i
was i put many miles between myself and
my host before morning dawned the re-
mainder of my journey was uneventful

iv

can never voice the sensations that
surged through me as i walked through
the streets of my home town and saw the


famous fantastic mysteries

familiar faces and friends and acquaint-
ances not one of whom gave me a glance
of recognition or a word of greeting rip
van winkles plight was no more unhappy

  before my departure on that fatal
astral trip i had held an important cleri-
cal position with the leading business firm
of the town it was my desire to regain
this but naturally there were serious diffi-
culties in the way i could not present the
required credentials or prove that by edu-
cation or experience i was fitted for it

  i learned that the place had never been
satisfactorily filled since my going away
and i determined to use every power i
possessed to regain it after repeated ef-
forts i succeeded in getting my former
employers consent to take the place on
trial

  i took up the work with such surpris-
ing readiness and showed such a thorough
knowledge of its details and requirements
that i proved a constant source of aston-
ishment to all connected with the business
many times they would remark i could
almost believe it to be jim back again

  as weeks went by i found repeated op-
portunities to meet my wife but daughter
of eve that she was she was interested in
another man believing me dead she had
accepted his attentions and their friend-
ship had apparently ripened into love

  i was desperate was i to be thwarted
in my aim to be reunited to my wife after
all the struggles i had made to attain that
end my efforts to win her attention to
say nothing about her affections were un-
availing my rival was too firmly en-
trenched

  in sheer desperation i one day called
at her home forced my presence upon her
and attempted to relate my experiences
from the day i left her i believe i could
have impressed her with the truth of my
story if i had been left to myself i in-
tended to prove my identity by telling
many of the little incidents of our life
together which no one else knew about but
i was abruptly and unceremoniously in-
terrupted by her lover who appeared at
an inopportune moment

  my wife had become so overwrought by
my story and by my close resemblance in
many ways to my old self that she was
nearly overcome with fright and emotion
this angered my rival to such an extent
that he caused me to be arrested and ex-
amined to determine my sanity

  i tried to interest the alienists in my
strange experience but only defeated my
own ends as my story evidently convinced
them that i was not in a proper mental
condition to be at large

  i was therefore sent to an asylum
where i remained for some time before
i could convince the medical board that
i was sane

  it was during this period that i pre-
pared a story of my strange experience
which i succeeded in getting published it
fell into my wifes hands and she became
convinced of the truth of it then it was
that through her untiring efforts i was
liberated from the asylum and we were
remarried not however until i had sol-
emnly promised to try no more astral ex-
periments

  this pledge i was willing enough to
make as my bitter experiences had con-
vinced me that while one is occupying
his earthly body and living his mundane
life his wisest course is to content him-
self with living it as normally as possible

  i believed that at last i had found
peace after my eventful and troublous
experiences and i proposed to settle down
and enjoy life serenely but i reckoned
without my host a complication of affairs
i had never dreamed possible wound their
entangling web around me and i was
caught in their snare

  one day as i was coming home from
the office a fine appearing woman met me
and with astonishment written all over her
face uttered one word david

  remembering my former experience the
word spoken so intently struck a chill to
my heart and a strange foreboding a
premonition of trouble took hold of me

  who are you i inquired

  you know very well who i am it is
hardly possible that you have forgotten
an astral gentleman



your wife agnes whom you left so sud-
denly ten years ago

then she broke down and began
weeping so bitterly that i was moved
to pity

  oh david she said brokenly why
did you desert me so i have loved you all
these years and have been faithful to
you

  but i am not david i protested and
if i were rest assured t would never desert
so charming a woman as you are

  my gallantry had slight effect

  not david oh but you are david
why do you deny it why there is the
scar across your left cheek that you got
the day we climbed mount pisgah to-
gether a few weeks before we were mar-
ried dont you remember falling and cut-
ting that ugly gash and how i dressed the
wound binding it with strips torn from
my own clothing

  here was a dilemma indeed evidently
tramp david had a wife and she was
about to claim me for her own the idea
would not have been so terrible had i
not such binding claims in another quar-
ter i put on as bold a front as possible
under the circumstances

  madam i said sternly i regret to
pain you but this is evidently a case of
mistaken identity there are many such
it is not so unusual as you imagine from
your words and actions i gather that i
bear a striking resemblance to your hus-
band who you say has deserted you as
for myself i am james rogers an em-
ployee of the jones  matthews com-
pany over there my wife is waiting sup-
per for me so i must bid you good eve-
ning i touched my hat and turned

  with all the anger and bitterness of
years concentrated into one moment of
time she turned to me

  scoundrel traitor she hissed you
would add insult to years of bitter injury
would you you are my husband and you
shall suffer a thousandfold what i have
suffered through you

  i was greatly disturbed for i knew not

  for what sins of tramp daves i might be
called upon to answer even now i was
facing a queer mix-up

  i went home and told my wife what
had happened and together we conjectured
as to the strange incident and its prob-
able outcome but our suspense was short
for i was soon in the hands of officers
arrested on a charge of bigamy

  i was taken back to the town where i
had chanced to call at the home of the
tramps brother while on my journey
home there i was arraigned in court
the odds were all against me many peo-
ple testified that i was david lawrence
and the former life of the man in whose
body i stood at the bar of justice was
reviewed in all its black details i blushed
for shame at the record

  he had at last become a parasite on
society an outcast from among his fellow
townsmen he had not been heard from
in ten years but was probably making
an effort to reach his old home when death
overtook him surely if i could have
known his dark history i might have hesi-
tated before appropriating his body to my
own use but here i was and i must pay

  even the brothers testimony much as
he would have liked to help me proved
damaging for he identified me as his
brother and told of my visit at his home
and of my sudden departure

  i was given a prison sentence for big-
amy and of course could not escape serv-
ing it the woman who brought the final
trouble upon me finally decided that i was
utterly worthless and very sensibly and
much to my satisfaction secured a di-
vorce when at last i walked out of prison
a free man my long-suffering wife took
me back once more

  i	am broken in health and in spirit
a man old before my time one word of
caution i offer in closing this weird tale
to whoever may attempt to investigate
the occult let him not carry his researches
beyond the border-line where the red sign
of danger is flaunted lest the fate over-
take him unawares that befell myself-the
astral gentleman

what happened before

  following the strange and inexplicable
disappearance of dr david throckmartins
wife his associate dr stanton and his
wifes maid thora helverson in the un-
canny depths of the moon pool and the still
more amazing disappearance of throck-
martin himself from the ship southern
queen in midocean dr goodwin set out to
investigate thoroughly the appalling phe-
nomena and if possible effect a rescue of
the victims

  while proceeding toward the caroline
islands on the outlying island of which
inan-matal was the entrance to the vast
cavern in which was the moon pool he en-
countered captain olaf huldricksson a
huge giant of a man he told how a spark-
ling devil had come down the path of the
moon and taken his wife and his little
daughter freda

  he joined dr goodwin and the two with
larry okeefe young half-american half-
irish member of the royal air force landed
on nan-matal

  the full of the moon was past but by
means of light condensers dr goodwin
managed to focus the moon rays in suffi-
cient strength to cause the rock door to the
moon pool to open

  they found a stranger there-dr von
hetzdorp a german scientist all of them
were suddenly trapped inside the door as it
swung closed for the benefit of all they
made a truce with the german after pass-
ing around the moon pool they came to a
blank wall where a beautiful girl accom-
panied by a huge frog-woman appeared to
them and by signs showed them the secret
springs that opened the wall before them

  at last they arrived in a vast country miles

  below the surface where existed a race of
powerful dwarfs ruled over by a beautiful
woman yolara priestess of the shining
one and lugur the voice a man of
herculean strength

  yolara soon showed that she was attracted
by okeefe thereby arousing the fury of
lugur but larry having fallen in love
with the vision of the moon pool chamber
-whom he has learned is lakla hand-
maiden of the silent ones and as good as
yolara is evil-did not respond

  the german and lugur joined forces and
though their enmity to the americans was
carefully veiled it was none the less sinister
and threatening that the powerful in-
fluence of lakla and the silent ones is on
their side however gave larry and dr
goodwin hope

  larry and dr goodwin were summoned
to appear before yolara they entered her
audicnce room with the dwarf in charge
of them

yolara vs the okeefe

the chamber was small the opal
walls screening it on three sides
the black opacity covering it the
fourth side opening out into a delicious
little walled garden a mass of the fra-
grant luminous blooms and delicately
colored fruit facing it was a small table
of reddish wood and from the omnipresent
cushions heaped around it arose to greet
us-yolara

larry drew in his breath with an invol-

deep in the secret caverns of the moon pool a drama of love and hate unfolds
beauty incomparable-devilish malignity unspeakable which is the real power
of this fantastic world within the world

untary gasp of admiration and bowed low
my own admiration was as frank and the
priestess was well pleased with our hom-
age

  she was swathed in the filmy half-
revelant webs now of palest blue the
corn-silk hair was caught within a wide-
meshed golden net in which sparkled tiny
brilliants like blended sapphires and dia-
monds her own azure eyes sparkled as
brightly as they and i noted again in
their clear depths the half-eager approval
as they rested upon okeefes lithe well-
knit figure and his keen clean-cut face
the high-arched slender feet rested upon
soft sandals whose gauzy withes laced the
exquisitely formed leg to just below the
dimpled knee

  some knockout exclaimed larry
looking at me and placing a hand over
his heart put her on a new york roof
and shed empty broadway dramatic
sense too well developed though for com-
fort soft pedal on that stuff i dont want
any more of those songar matinees take
the cue from me doc

  he turned to yolara

  i said o lady whose shining hair is
a web for hearts that in our world your
beauty would dazzle the sight of men as
would a little woman sun he said in
the florid imagery to which the tongue
lends itself so well

  a tiny flush stole up through the trans-
lucent skin the blue eyes softened and
she waved us toward the cushions black-
haired maids stole in placing before us
the fruits the little loaves and a steam-
ing drink somewhat the color and odor
of chocolate i was conscious of outraged
hunger

  what are you named strangers she
asked

  this man is named goodwin said
okeefe as for me call me larry

  nothing like getting acquainted quick
he said to me-but kept his eyes upon
yolara as though he were voicing another
honeyed phrase and so she took it for
you must teach me your tongue she
said

  then shall i have two words where
now i have one to tell you of your love-
liness he answered her

  and also thatll take time he spoke
to me essential occupation out of which
we cant be drafted to make these fun
loving folk any roman holiday get me

  larree mused yolara i like the
sound it is sweet- and indeed it was
as she spoke it

  and what is your land named larree
she continued and goodwins she
caught the sound perfectly

  my land o lady of loveliness is two-
ireland and america his but one-amer-
ica

  she repeated the two names slowly over
and over we seized the opportunity to
attack the food halting half guiltily as she
spoke again

  oh but you are hungry she cried
eat then she leaned her chin upon her
hands and regarded us whole fountains
of questions brimming up in her eyes

  how is it larree that you have two
countries and goodwin but one she
asked at last unable to keep silent longer

  i was born in ireland he in america
but i have dwelt long in his land and my 
heart loves each he said

  she nodded understandingly

  are all the men of ireland like you
larree as all the men here are like lugur
or rador i like to look at you she went
on with naive frankness i am tired of
men like lugur and rador but they are
strong she added swiftly lugur can
hold up twenty in his two arms and raise
six with but one hand

  we could not understand her numerals
and she raised white fingers to illustrate

  that is little o lady to the men of
ireland replied okeefe lo i have seen
one of my race hold up ten times twenty
of our-what you call that swift thing
in which rador brought us here

  corial she said

  hold up ten times twenty of our corials
with but two fingers and these corials of
ours-

  coria said she
---------

the conquest of the moon pool

  and these coria of ours are each greater
in weight than ten of yours yea and i
have seen another with but one blow of
his hand raise hell

  and so i have he murmured to me

and both at forty-second and fifth ave-
nue n y-u s a

  yolara considered all this with mani-
fest doubt

  hell she inquired at last i know
not the word

  well answered okeefe say muria
then in many ways they are i gather o
hearts delight one and the same

  now the doubt in the blue eyes was
strong indeed she shook her head

  none of our men can do that she
answered at length nor do i think you
could larree

  oh no said larry easily i never
tried to be that strong i fly he added
casually

  the priestess rose to her feet gazing
at him with startled eyes

  fly she repeated incredulously
like a zitia a bird

  larry nodded and then seeing the
dawning command in her eyes went on
hastily

  not with my own wings yolara in
a-a corial that moves through-whats
the word for air doc-well through
this- he made a wide gesture up toward
the nebulous haze above us he took a
pencil and on a white cloth made a hasty
sketch of an airplane in a corial like
this she regarded the sketch gravely
thrust a hand down into her girdle and
brought forth a keen-bladed poniard cut
larrys markings out and placed the frag-
ments carefully aside

  that i can understand she said
remarkably intelligent young woman
muttered okeefe hope im not giving
anything away but she had me

	you have a god in ireland and
america she asked larry nodded
what is he called she continued

  he is called the prince of peacean-
swered larry and his tone was reverent



  does your god dwell with you like-
she hesitated or afar like thanaroa
he dwells in the heart of each of his
followers yolara answered the irishman
gravely

  yes so does thanaroa but- she
hesitated again

  but what are your women like larree
are they like me and how many have
loved you

  in all ireland and america there is
none like you yolara he answered and
take that any way you please he whis-
pered in english she took it it was evi-
dent as it most pleased her

  do you have goddesses she asked
every woman in ireland and america
is a goddess he answered

  now that i do not believe there
was both anger and mockery in her eyes
i know women larree and if that were
so there would be no peace for men
there isnt said okeefe the anger
died out and she laughed sweetly under-
standing

  and which goddess do you worship
you said larry okeefe boldly
larry larry i whispered be care-
ful its high explosive

  but the priestess was laughing little
trills of sweet bell notes and pleasure was
in each note

  you are indeed bold larree she
said to offer me your worship yet am
i pleased by your boldness still lugur
is strong and you are not of those who-
what did you say-have tried and your
wings are not here larree

  again her laughter rang out the irish-
man flushed it was touche for yolara

  fear not for me with lugur he said
grimly rather fear for him

  the laughter died she looked at him
searchingly approval again in her eyes a
little enigmatic smile about her mouth-
so sweet and so cruel

  well we shall see she murmured
you say you battle in your world with
what

  oh with this and that answered
larry airily we manage


famous fantastic mysteries

 have you the keth-i mean that
with which i sent songar into the noth-
ingness she asked swiftly

  see what shes driving at okeefe
spoke to me swiftly well i do gray
matter in that ladys head but heres
where the okeefe lands

  i said he turned to her o voice of
silver fire that your spirit is high even
as your beauty and searches out mens
souls as does your loveliness their hearts
and now listen yolara for what i speak
is truth-into his eyes came the far-away
gaze into his voice the irish softness
lo in my land of ireland this many of
your lifes length agone-see-he raised
his ten fingers clenched and unclenched
them twenty times-the mighty men of
my race the taitha-da-dainn could send
men out into the nothingness even as do
you with the keth and this they did by
their harpings and by words spoken-
words of power o yolara that have their
power still--and by pipings and by slay-
ing sounds

  his eyes were bright dream filled she
shrank a little from him faint pallor on
the perfect skin

  and they could make as well as de-
stroy those men of ireland he said i
say to you yolara that these things were
and are-in ireland his voice rang
strong and i have seen men as many
as those that are in your great chamber
this many times over blasted into nothing-
ness before your keth could even have
touched them yea-and rocks as mighty
as those through which we came lifted up
and shattered before the lids could fall
over your blue eyes and this is truth
yolara-all truth stay-have you that
little cone of the keth with which you de-
stroyed songar

  she nodded gazing at him fascinated
fear and puzzlement contending

  then use it he took a vase of crystal
from the table placed it on the threshold
that led into the garden use it on this
and i will show you

  i will use it upon one of the ladala-
she began eagerly

  the exaltation dropped from him there
was a touch of horror in the eyes he
turned to her her own dropped before it
it shall be as you say she said hur-
riedly she drew the shining cone from
her breast leveled it at the vase the green
ray leaped forth spread over the crystal
but before its action could even be begun
a flash of light shot from okeefes hand
his automatic spat and the trembling vase
flew into fragments as quickly as he had
drawn it he thrust the pistol back into
place and stood there empty-handed look-
ing at her sternly from the anteroom came
shouting a rush of feet

yolaras face was white her eyes
strained but her voice was unshaken
as she called to the clamoring guards

  it is nothing go to your places

  but when the sound of their return had
ceased she stared tensely at the irishman
then she looked again at the shattered
vase

  it is true she cried but see the
keth is-alive

  i followed her pointing finger each
broken bit of the crystal was vibrating
shaking its particles out into space broken
it the bullet of larrys had-but not re-
leased it from the grip of the disintegrating
force the priestesss face was triumphant

  but what matters it  shining urn
of beauty-what matters it to the vase
that is broken what happens to its frag-
ments asked larry gravely-and point-
edly

  the triumph died from her face and
for a space she was silent brooding

  next whispered okeefe to me lots
of surprises in the little box keep your
eye on the opening and see what comes
out

  he had not long to wait there was a
sparkle of anger about yolara something
too of injured pride she clapped her
hands whispered to the maid who an-
swered her summons and then sat back
regarding us maliciously

  you have answered me as to your
strength but you have not proved it
the conquest of the moon pool



answered me as to your god and left me
doubtful indeed but the keth you have
answered now answer this she said

  she pointed out into the garden i saw
a flowering branch suddenly bend and
snap as though a hand had broken it but
no hand was there saw then another and
another bend and break a little tree sway
and fall and closer and closer to us came
the trail of snapping boughs while down
into the garden poured the silvery light
revealing-nothing now a great ewer
beside a pillar rose swiftly in air and
hurled itself crashing at my feet cushions
close to us swirled about as though in the
vortex of a whirlwind

  an unseen hand held my arms in a
mighty clutch fast to my sides another
gripped my throat and i felt a needle-
sharp poniard pierce my shirt touch the
skin just over my heart

  larry i cried despairingly i
twisted my head saw that he too was
caught in this grip of the invisible but
his face was calm even amused

  keep cool doc he said remember
she wants to learn the language

  now from yolara burst chime upon
chime of mocking laughter she gave a
command the hands loosened the poniard
withdrew from my heart suddenly as i
had been caught i was free and unpleas-
antly weak and shaky

  have you that in ireland larree
cried the priestess and once more trem-
bled with laughter

  a good play yolara his voice was as
calm as his face but theres a tree in
ireland yolara with little red berries and
its called the rowan tree and if you take
the berries and squeeze them on your eyes
and hands when the moon is just so theres
nobody can see you at all its old in
ireland yolara and in goodwins land
they make ships-coria that go on water-
so you can pass by them and see only sea
and sky and those water coria are each
of the many times greater than this whole
palace of yours

  but the priestess laughed on

  it did get me a little whispered

larry that wasnt quite up to my mark
but if we could find it out and take it
back to be used for war

  not so larree yolara gasped
through her laughter not so goodwins
cry betrayed you

  her good humor had entirely returned
she was like a mischievous child pleased
over some successful trick and like a
child she cried-ill show you-signaled
again whispered to the maid who quickly
returning laid before her a long metal
case yolara took from her girdle some-
thing that looked like a small pencil
pressed it and shot a thin stream of
light for all the world like an electric
flash upon its hasp the lid flew open
out of it she drew three flat oval cry-
stals faint rose in hue she handed one
to okeefe and one to me

  look she commanded placing the
third beore her own eyes i peered through
the stone and instantly there leaped into
sight out of thin air six grinning dwarfs
each was covered from top of head to
soles of feet in a web so tenuous that
through it their bodies were plain the
gauzy stuff seemed to vibrate its strands
to run together like quicksilver i snatched
the crystal from my eyes and the chamber
was empty put it back-and there were
the grinning six

  yolara gave another sign and they dis-
appeared even from the crystals

  it is what they wear larree ex-
plained yolara graciously it is some-
thing that came to us from the ancient
ones but we have so few she sighed
and the secret of their making is well-
nigh lost it is difficult to make-she
hesitated-but almost are we upon the
verge of refinding its ease

  such treasures must be two-edged
swords yolara commented okeefe
for how know you that one within
them creeps not to you with hand eager
to strike

  there is no danger she said indif-
ferently i am the keeper of them and
i know always where they are besides
they cannot pass through the blackness


famous fantastic mysteries

  when one wears them and tries to pass
  the darkness sucks the light out of him
  as thirsty ground does water and at
  last he is naught but one of those shadows
  of which you speak larree-although the
  robe itself is not harmed i will have
  one of the ladala don one and show you
  she added brightly

    no no cried okeefe she regarded
  him amused

    and now no more abruptly you
  two are to appear before the council at
  a certain time but fear nothing you
  goodwin go with rador about our city
  and increase your wisdom but you larree
  await me here in my garden she smiled
  at him provocatively maliciously too
  for shall not one who has resisted a
  world of goddesses be given all chance
  to worship when at last he finds his
  own

v

    she laughed whole-heartedly and was
  gone and at that moment i liked yolara
  better than ever i had before and-alas
  -better than ever i was to in the future

 i noted rador standing outside the
 open jade door and started to go but
 okeefe caught me by the arm

    wait a minute he urged about
  golden eyes- you were going to tell
  me something its been on my mind
  all through that little sparring match

    i told him of the vision that had
  passed through my closing lids he listened
  gravely and then laughed

     hell of a lot of privacy in this place
  he grinned ladies who can walk through
  walls and others with regular invisible
  cloaks to let em flit wherever they please
  oh well dont let it get on your nerves
  doc remember everythings natural
  that robe stuff is just camouflage of
  course but lord if we could only get
  a piece of it

    the material simply admits all light-
  vibrations or perhaps curves them just
  as the opaque screens cut them off i
  answered a man under the x-ray is
  partly invisible this makes him wholly
  so he doesnt register as the people

of the motion picture profession say

  i doped that out myself as soon as
i -had my first peep he said but you
want to keep remembering its all natural
just keep saying that to yourself theyve
got a bag of tricks and they keep pulling
them when we get on to em all weli
be all right

  i began to be irritated why this re-
peated warning to me who knew only
fact

  and as for their shining one say
larry snorted id like to set the okeefe
banshee up against it ill bet that old
resourceful irish body would give it the
first three bites and a strangle hold and
wallop it before it knew it had em
rador beckoned me

  im glad golden eyes is on the job
no matter how unconventional her visits
are but i wish shed show her -hand
soon sighed larry

  then the mercurial celtic mind went
back to that other picture he had drawn

  if our banshee ever takes it into its
head to land here to help me out instead
of ushering me out-oh boy

  i heard him still chuckling gleefully
over this vision as i passed along the
opal wall with the green dwarf bound
for my first excursion

  would i come across any trace of
throckmartin did i dare even to hint
to rador the real reason we had invaded
this enigmatic land

chapter xvi

  the lovely land of lurking hate

as i reached rador i looked at my
watch which i had taken the pre-
caution to wind before preparing for
sleep it had then been eleven oclock
of the morning in our world outside now
the watch registered four but whether
we had slept five hours or seventeen or
twenty-nine i had no means of knowing
rador scanned the dial with much in-
terest drew from his girdle a small disk
and compared the two

  his had thirteen divisions and be-
the conquest of the moon pool



neath the circle marking them another
circle divided into smaller spaces about
each circle a small growing point moved
what he held was in principle a watch
the same as mine but i could not know
upon what system their time recording
was based

  later i was to find that reckoning
rested upon the extraordinary increased
luminosity of the cliffs at the time of full
moon on earth this action to my mind
being linked either with the effect of the
light-streaming globes upon the moon
pool whose source was in the shining
cliffs or else upon some mysterious af-
finity of their radiant element with the
hood of moonlight on earth the latter
most probably because even when the
moon must have been clouded above it
made no difference in the phenomenon

  thirteen of these shining forth con-
stituted a laya one of them a lat ten
was sa ten times ten times ten a said
or thousand ten times a thousand was a
sais a sais of laya was then literally ten
thousand years what we would call an
hour was by them called a va the whole
time system was of course a mingling
of time as it had been known to their
remote surface-dwelling ancestors and
the peculiar determining factors in the
vast  cavern

  an hour of our time is the equivalent
of an hour and five-eights in muria for
further information upon this matter of
relativity the reader may consult any of
the numerous books upon the subject

  two va we have before the council
sits rador said thrusting the disk back
in his girdle as a man of learning you
are to be shown whatever of ours may
interest you while the afyo maie sits
with that of yours which certainly in-
terests her he said maliciously but
this i warn you-how are you named
stranger

  goodwin i answered

  goodwin he repeated as excellently
as had yolara this i must warn you
goodwin that i will answer you all i
may but some things i must not you

shall know by my silence what these
are

  on fire with eagerness i hurried on
a shell was awaiting us i paused before
entering it to examine the polished surface
of runways and great road it was
obsidian-volcanic glass of pale emerald
unflawed translucent with no sign of
block or juncture it was indeed as
though it had been poured molten and
then gone over as carefully as a jeweler
would a gem i examined the shell

  what makes it go i asked rador
at a word from him the driver touched
a concealed spring and an aperture ap-
peared beneath the control-lever within
was a small cube of black crystal through
whose sides i saw dimly a rapidly re-
volving glowing ball not more than two
inches in diameter beneath the cube was
a curiously shaped slender cylinder wind-
ing down into the lower body of the
nautilus whorl

  watch said rador he motioned me
into the vehicle and took a place beside
me the driver touched the lever a stream
of coruscations flew from the ball into
the cylinder the shell started smoothly
and as the tiny torrent of shining particles
increased it gathered speed

  the corial does not touch the road
explained rador it is lifted so far

--he held his forefinger and thumb less
than a sixteenth of an inch apart-above
it

  and perhaps here is the best place to
explain the activation of the shells or
coria the force utilized was atomic energy
passing from the whirling ball the ions
darted through the cylinder to two bands
of a peculiar metal affixed to the base
of the vehicles somewhat like skids of
a sled impinging upon these they pro-
duced a partial negation of gravity lift-
ing the shell slightly and at the same
time creating a powerful repulsive force
or thrust that could be directed backward
forward or sidewise at the will of the
driver something of the same kind of force
accounted for the hearing-talking globes
they used to communicate with each other


famous fantastic mysteries

the wide glistening road was gay
with the coria they darted in and
out of the gardens within them the fair
haired extraordinarily beautiful women
on their cushions were like princesses of
elfland caught in gorgeous fairy webs
resting within the hearts of flowers in
some shells were flaxen-haired dwarfish
men of lugurs type sometimes black-
polled brother officers of rador often
raven-tressed girls plainly handmaidens
of the women and now and then beauties
of the lower folk went by with one of
the blond dwarfs-and then it was plain
indeed what their relations were

  among those who walked along the
paralleling promenade were none of the
fair-haired and the haunting wistfulness
that underlay the thin film of gaiety on
the faces and in the eyes of the black-
haired folk and its contrast with the
sinisterly sweet malice the sheer unhuman
exuberance of life written upon the fair-
haired made something deep deep within
me tremble with indefinite repulsion

  we swept around the turn that made
of the jewel-like roadway an enormous
horseshoe and speedily upon our right
the cliffs through which we had come
in our journey from the moon pool began
to march forward beneath their mantels
of moss they formed a gigantic abut-
ment a titanic salient it had been from
the very front of this salients invading
angle that we had emerged on each
side of it the precipices faintly glowing
drew back and vanished into distance

  at the bridge-span we had first crossed
rador stopped the corial beckoning me
to accompany him we climbed the arch
and stood once more upon the mossy
ledge half a score of the dwarfs were
cutting into the cliff face using tools
much resembling our own pneumatic drills
except that they had no connection with
any energizing machinery the drills bit
in smoothly but slowly i imagined that
their power was supplied by the same
force that ran the coria and asked rador
he nodded

  they search for your disappearing

portal he grinned mischievously i
thought of the depth of that monstrous
slice of solid stone that had dropped be-
fore us and over whose top we had
passed through the hundred-foot tunnel
and i felt fairly certain that they would
not soon penetrate to the well of the
stairway that it concealed and to which
the golden girl had led us and i was
equally sure the art that had covered
this entrance so amazingly had provided
at the same time a screen for the oval
high above through which our eyes had
first beheld the city of the shining one

  somewhat grimly i asked rador why
they did not use the green ray to dis-
integrate the rock as it had the body
of songar he answered that they did
use it but sparingly

  there were two reasons for this he
went on to explain first that in varying
degrees all the rock walls resisted it
the shining cliffs on the opposite side
of the white waters completely and
second that when it was used it was
at the risk of very dangerous rock falls
there were it appeared lines of non-
resistance in the cliffs-faults i suppose
-which under the keth disintegrated
instantaneously these lines of non-resist-
ance could not be mapped out beforehand
and were likely to bring enormous masses
of the resistant portion tumbling down
exactly i gathered as a structure of
cemented stone would tumble if the cement
should abruptly crumble into dust

  they seldom used the ray therefore
for tunneling or blasting rock in situ
the resistant qualities of the barriers
were probably due to the presence of
radioactive elements that neutralized the
vibratory ray whose essence was of course
itself radioactive

  the slender graceful bridges under
which we skimmed ended at openings in
the upflung far walls of verdure each
had its little garrison of soldiers through
some of the openings a rivulet of the
green obsidian river passed these were
roadways to the farther country to the
land of the ladala rador told me adding
the conquest of the moon pool



that none of the lesser folk could cross
into the pavilioned city unless summoned
or without pass

  we turned the bend of the road and
flew down that further emerald ribbon
we had seen from the great oval be-
fore us rose the shining cliffs and the
lake a half-mile perhaps from these
the last of the bridges flung itself it
was more massive and about it hovered
a spirit of ancientness lacking in the
other spans also its garrison was larger
and at its base the tangent way was
guarded by two massive structures some-
what like block-houses between which it
ran something about it aroused in me
an intense curiosity

  where does that road lead rador
i asked

  to the one place above all of which
i may not tell you goodwin he an-
swered and again i wondered and into
my wonder burst a thought did the
road lead to throckmartin and those
others the dweller had made its prey
how could t find out

  we skimmed slowly out upon the great
pier far to the left was the prismatic
rainbow curtain between the cyclopean
pillars on the white waters swam grace-
ful shells luculent replicas of the elf
chariots but none was near that distant
web of wonder

  rador what is that i asked

  it is the veil of the shining one
he answered slowly

  was the shining one that which we
named the dweller

  what is the shining one i cried
eagerly again he was silent nor did he
speak until we had turned on our home-
ward way

  and lively as was my interest my
scientific curiosity i was conscious sud-
denly of acute depression beautiful won-
drously beautiful this place was and yet
in its wonder dwelt a keen edge of
menace of unease of inexplicable in-
human woe as though in a secret garden
of god a soul should sense upon-rt the
gaze of some lurking spirit of evil which

some way somehow had crept into the
sanctuary and only bided its time to
spring

chapter xvii

the leprechawn

the shell carried us straight back to
the house of yolara we stood again
before the tenebrous wall where first we
had faced the priestess and the voice
and as we stood again the portal ap-
peared with all its disconcerting magical
abruptness rador drew aside i entered
once more the entrance faded

  but now the scene was changed around
the jet table were grouped a number of
figures-lugur yolara beside him seven
others-all of them fair-haired and all
men save one who sat at the left of
the priestess-an old old woman how
old the woman was i could not tell her
face bearing traces of beauty that must
once have been as great as yolaras own
but now ravaged in some way awesome
through its ruins the fearful malicious
gaiety shining out like a spirit of joy
held within a corpse

   larry was not present i wondered why
but as i wondered he entered he sent
me a cheerful grin and yolara darted a
glance at him that was revealing lugur
saw it too and read it aright for his
face darkened began then our examina-
tion for such it was and as it progressed
i was more and more struck by the change
in the okeefe all flippancy was gone
rarely did his sense of humor reveal it-
self in any of his answers he was like
a cautious swordsman fencing guarding
studying his opponent or rather like a
chess-player who keeps sensing some far-
reaching purpose in the game alert con-
tained watchful always he stressed the
power qf our surface races their multi-
tudes their solidarity

  their questions were myriad what
were our occupations our system of
government how great were the waters
the land intensely interested were they
in our wars querying minutely into their


famous fantastic mysteries

causes their results lugur was curiously
silent but at some of our answers i
caught his sneer and saw behind it-
von hetzdrop in our weapons their
interest was avid and they were exceed-
ingly minute in their examination of
us as to the ruins which had excited our
curiosity their position and surroundings
-and if others than ourselves might be
expected to find and pass through their
entrance

  at this i shot a glance at lugur he
did not seem unduly interested i won-
dered if the german had told him as
yet of the girl of the rosy wall of the
moon pool chamber and the real reasons
for our search then i answered as briefly
as possible omitting all reference to these
things the red dwarf watched me with
unmistakable amusement and i knew von
hetzdorp had told him but clearly lugur
had kept his information even from
yolara and as clearly she had spoken
to none of that episode when okeefes
automatic had shattered the keth-smitten
vase and again i felt that sense of deep
bewilderment of helpless search for clues
to all the tangle

  for two hours we were questioned and
then the priestess called rador and let us

go-

  larry was somber as we returned rador
soon left us

  one things sure larry remarked
almost inconsequentially weve got to
beat von hetzdorp to it didnt see any-
thing of a lady named lakla in your
trip around the bazaars did you

  i shook my head he walked about
the room uneasily

  hells brewing here all right he said
at last stopping before me i cant make
out just the particular brand thats all
that bothers me were going to have a
stiff fight thats sure what i want to
do quick is to find the golden girl doc
havent seen her on the wall lately have
you he queried hopefully fantastic

  laugh if you want to he went on
but shes our best bet its going to
be a race between her and the okeefe

banshee but i put my money on her
i had a queer experience while i was
in that garden after youd left his
voice grew solemn did you ever see
a leprechawn doc i shook my head
again as solemnly hes a little man
in green said larry oh about as
high as your knee i saw one once in
carntogher woods and as i sat there
half asleep in yolaras garden the liv-
ing spit of him stepped out from one
of those bushes twirling a little shillalah

   its a tight box yere gettin in larry
avick said he but dont ye be down-
hearted lad

   im carrying on said i but youre
a long way from ireland  i said or
thought i did

 teve a lot o friends there he
a answered an where the heart
rests the feet are swift to follow not
that im sayin id like to live here
larry said he

   i know where my heart is now i
told him it rests on a girl with golden
eyes and the hair and swan-white breast
of eilidh the fair but me feet dont
seem to get me to her i said

  the brogue thickened

  an the little man in green nodded
his head an whirled his shillalah

   its what i came to tell ye says he
dont ye fall for the behan-numher
the serpent woman wit the blue eyes
shes a daughter of ivor lad an dont
ye do nothin to make the brown-haired
colleen ashamed o ye larry okeefe
i knew yer great great grandfather an
his before him aroon says he an wan
o the okeefe failins is to think their
hearts big enough to hold all the wimmen
o the world

   a hearts built to hold only wan per-
manently larry he says an im warn-
in ye a nice girl dont like to move into
a place all cluttered up wid anothers

   you dont have to be cornin all this
way to tell me that i answer

   well im just a-tellin you he
says yeve got some rough knocks corn-
in larry in fact  yere in for a very
devil of a time but remember that
yere the okeefe says he an while
the bhoys are all wid ye avick yeve
got to be on the job yourself

  an i looked again and there was only
a bush waving said larry

  there wasnt a smile in my heart-
or if there was it was a very tender one
subsconscious visions or whatever it had
been he meant every word and i was
curiously touched

lord id like to have a cigarette
he said spill me a little scientific dope
old dear what is this place anyway
well i said i think its the matrix
of the moon

  the what he exclaimed with almost
ludicrous amazement

  that i continued would explain
these enormous caverned spaces-scar
tissue of the world permeated with gi-
gantic spaces as human scar tissue is
often permeated with lesions beneath
the scarified surface now these people
we have encountered are undoubtedly as
poor throckmartin divined the remnants
of that last and ancient race that built the
nan-matal and similar pacific structures
undoubtedly they were forced below as
their continent subsided and here the
green dwarfs statement that they made
their way here where was the shining

one and where others before us had been
is highly suggestive

  larry nodded and i went on

  that they knew nothing of the ex-
istence of the passage from the chamber
of the moon pool proves that they have
lost much of the ancient knowledge-
if indeed they ever possessed it

  on the other hand yolara it was
clear knows of the sinister excursions
of the dweller into the -outer world
but knowing that she must also know
how the thing you saw comes out larry
objected besides the place of the moon
pool was clearly known to the builders
of nan-tanach who were apparently
the forefathers of these

   admit that it is puzzling i an-
swered still neither yolara nor lugur
did know perhaps the hidden road was
made by the earliest of their buried kind
and the secret lost or it may be it was
built by some of that race they found
-i had a flash of intuition-to keep
watch upon them and upon the shining
one who may have escaped some way
somehow their own control

  larry shook his head perplexedly
theres some sort of scrap brewing
all right he observed maybe youre
right what the devil are the silent
ones and where is that golden girl
who led us lakla the handmaiden his
eyes grew soft and far away

  ask rather where is throckmartin
and his and where the wife of olaf i
answered a little bruskly

  im going to bed he said abruptly

chapter xviii

  allons enfants de la patrie

between the seven sleeps that fol-
lowed larry and i saw but little
of each other yolara sought him more
and more thrice we were called before
the council once we were at a great
feast whose splendors and surprises i
can never forget largely i was in the
company of rador together we two
passed the green barriers into the dwelling-
place of the ladala

  and here i felt the atmosphere of
hostility of brooding calamity stiffen
into a definite unpleasant reality we
went among them but never could i force
my mind through the armor of their
patent hate for rador or at least for
what he represented

  they lived in homes-if homes the
pavilions could be called-that were lesser
replicas of those within the city those
who supplied the necessities and luxuries
of their rulers worked in what were in
a fashion community houses of wood
and stone

  they seemed provided with everything
needful for life but everywhere was an
oppressiveness a gathering together of
hate that was spiritual rather than ma-
terial as tangible as the latter and far
far more menacing

  they do not like to dance with the
shining one was radors constant and
only reply to my efforts to find the
cause

  once i had concrete evidence of the
mood glancing behind me i saw a
white vengeful face peer from behind
a tree-trunk a hand lift a shining dart
speed from it straight toward radors
back instinctively i thrust him aside
he turned upon me angrily i pointed
to where the little missile lay still quiver-
ing on the ground he gripped my hand

  that some day i will repay he said
i looked again at the thing at its end was

a tiny cone covered with a glistening gela-
tinous substance

  rador pulled from a tree beside us a
fruit somewhat like an apple

  look he said he dropped it upon
the dart and at once before my eyes
in less than ten seconds the fruit had
rotted away

  thats what would have happened
to rador but for you friend he said

  still another curious incident i must
record here i had been commenting upon
the scarcity of bird-life the only avian
species i had seen so far had been a
few gaily colored tiny songless creatures
i mentioned unthinkingly the golden-
eyed bird that had greeted us he gave
evidence of perturbation indeed at this
he asked where we had seen it on
guard again i told him that it had ap-
peared when we emerged from the cliff

  tell that not to yolara nor to lugur
and warn larree he said earnestly

  i asked why he shook his head and
then softly his thoughts clearly finding
unconscious vent in words

  have the silent ones still the power
even as she says is the old wisdom yet
strong almost do i believe and it comes
to me that i would be glad to believe
and what said songar that these
strangers-

  he broke off and once more fell into
silence

  i cite these two happenings for the
light they cast upon that which i have
still to tell

  come now between this and the pre-
lude to the latter half of the tremendous
drama whose history this narrative is
the interlude rather between what has
gone before and the second curtain soon
to rise so amazingly-only scattering and
necessarily fragmentary observations

first the nature of the ebon opacities
blocking out the spaces between the
pavilion-pillars or covering their tops like
roofs these were magnetic fields light
absorbers negativing the vibrations of
radiance literally screens of electric force
the conquest of the moon pool



which formed as impervious a barrier to
light as would have screens of steel

  they instantaneously made night ap-
pear in a place where no night was but
they interposed no obstacle to air or to
sound they were extremely simple in
their inception no more miraculous than
is glass which inversely admits the vi-
brations of light but shuts out those
coarser ones we call air and partly those
others which produce upon our auditory
nerves the effects we call sound

  there were two favored classes of the
ladala they were soldiers and the
dream-makers the dream-makers were
the most astonishing social phenomena
i think of all denied by their circum-
scribed environment the wider experiences
of us of the outer world the murians
had perfected an amazing system of escape
through the imagination

  the dream-makers were recruited from
the ladala and must have been extremely
powerful far more so than the vulgar
fortunetellers of earth because to a cer-
tain extent the sleep visions they induced
were their own or were they

  at any rate they led a precarious life
because if their patrons were annoyed
by unpleasant sleep experiences they suf-
fered for it either by death or by cruel
beatings at the one feast i attended i
saw them summoned to the side of half-
drunken women and men to ply their
mysterious profession

  and before the sixth sleep i myself
was induced by rador to call upon one
i remember slipping straight out of this
consciousness straight into another-
visions of a young world-nightmare
figures-steaming jungles-monsters - a
bestial shaggy woman beast whom i also
a beast loved brutally but enough

  they were intensely musical their
favorite instruments were double flutes
immensely complex pipe-organs harps
great and small they had another re-
markable instrument made up of a double
octave of small drums which gav forth
percussions remarkably disturbing to the
emotional centers

  their development of music was in-
deed as decadent-if that be the right
word to use-as the activities of the
dream-makers they were-i quote an
extraordinary phrase of okeefes-jazz-
jag hounds

  it was this love of music that gave
rise to one of the few truly humorous
incidents of our caverned life larry came
to me just after our fourth sleep

  come on to a concert he said

  we skimmed off to one of the bridge
garrisons rador called the twoscore guards
to attention and then to my utter stupe-
faction the whole company okeefe lead-
ing them roared out the marseillaise
allons enfants de la patrie they sang
in a closer approach to the french than
might have been expected ten or fifty
miles below frances level marchons
mar chons they bellowed

  it was irresistibly funny and in my
laughter i forgot for the moment my
forebodings

  just wait until you hear yolara lisp
a pretty little thing i taught her said
larry as we set back for what we now
called home there was an impish twinkle
in his eyes

  and i did hear for it was not many
minutes after that the priestess condes-
cended to command me to come to her
with okeefe

  show goodwin how much you have
learned of our speech o lady of the lips
of honeyed flame murmured larry

  she hesitated smiled at him and then
from that perfect mouth out of the ex-
quisite throat in the voice that was like
the chiming of little silver bells she
trilled a melody familiar to me indeed

     shes only a bird in a gilded cage

     a bee-yu-tiful sight to see-

  and so on to the bitter end i did not
dare to look at okeefe with utmost
difficulty i controlled the spasm that shook
me

   she thinks its a love-song said larry
when we had left its only part of a
repertoire im teaching her honestly doc
its the only way i can keep my mind


famous fantastic mysteries

clear when im with her he went on
earnestly shes a devil-ess from hell-
but a wonder whenever i find myself
going i get her to sing that or take back
your gold and im back again pronto
with the right perspective pop goes all
the mystery hell i say shes only a
woman 

  through those seven sleeps there was
no sign either of olaf or of von hetzdorp
always when we asked yolara she said
that they were both well and content nor
was there sign of the golden girl al-
though larry told me that he dreamed
of her and sometimes i turned quickly
feeling her eyes upon me

  and ever the passion light in the eyes
of the priestess grew stronger more peril-
ous when she looked upon larry okeefe
and steadily the face of lugur grew more
forbidding

  then at last came the summons to that
tragic interlude which was to be the cur-
tain-raiser to the dread the incredible
the glorious finale of our adventure

chapter xix

the amphitheater of hell

for hours the black-haired folk had
been streaming across the bridges
flowing along the promenade by scores
and by hundreds drifting down toward
the gigantic seven-terraced temple whose
interior i had never as yet seen and
from whose towering exterior indeed i
had always been kept far enough away
-unobtrusively but none the less de-
cisively-to prevent any real observation
the structure i had estimated neverthe-
less could not reach less than a thou-
sand feet above its silvery base and the
diameter of its circular foundation was
about the same

  i wondered what it was that was bring-
ing the ladala into lora and where were
they vanishing all of them were flower-
crowned with the luminous lovely blooms
old and young slender mocking-eyed
girls dwarfed youths mothers with their
babes gnomed oldsters-on they poured

silent for the most part and sullen a
sullenness that held acid bitterness even
as iheir subtle half-sinister half-gay
malice seemed tempered into little keen-
edged flames oddly menacingly defiant

  there were many of the green-clad
soldiers along the way and the garrison
of the only bridge span i could see had
certainly been doubled

  wondering still i turned from my point
of observation and made my way back
to our pavilion hoping that larry who
had been with yolara for the past two
hours had returned hardly had i reached
it before rador came hurrying up in his
manner a curious exultance mingled with
what in any one else i would have called
a decided nervousness

  come he commanded before i could
speak the council has made decision
and larree is awaiting you

  what has been decided i panted as
we sped along the mosaicked path that
led to the house of yolara and why
is larry awaiting me

  and at his answer i felt my heart
pause in its beat and through me race
a wave of mingled panic and eagerness
panic born of the memory of that which
i had seen in the cabin of the southern
queen and eagerness that what i had
set forth to seek i was at last to find

  the shining one dances had an-
swered the green dwarf and you are
to worship

  lugur was against it he whispered
as we went swiftly on the shining
ones voice said no but the shining
ones priestess said yes and the council
thought at last and as usual as she
did what the shining one may think
friend goodwin i do not know-he
shot a mocking glance at me-but yolara
with you there is no fear that you will
join the dance he added hastily and
obviously with reassuring intention

  what was this dancing of the shining
one of which so often he had spoken
and in it what was there for us of the
deadly inexplicable danger that had
blasted throckmartin and his and de-
the conquest of the moon pool



stroyed the wife and child of olaf would
we meet at this ceremony whatever it
was those i had come here to find

  whatever my forebodings larry evi-
dently had none

  great stuff he cried when we had
met in the great antechamber now empty
of the dwarfs were invited to the show
reserved seats and all the rest of it
hope it will be worth seeing have to be
something damned good though to catch
me

  and remembering with a little shock
of apprehension that he had no knowledge
of the dweller beyond my poor descrip-
tion of it-for there are no words actually
to describe what that miracle of inter-
woven glory and horror was-i wondered
what larry okeefe would say and do
when he did behold it

  rador began to show impatience

  come he urged there is much
to be done and the time grows short

  he led us to a tiny fountain room
in whose miniature pool the white waters
were concentrated pearl-like and opales-
cent in their circling rim

  bathe he commanded and set the
example by stripping himself and plung-
ing within we followed i experienced
the peculiar stimulation that these waters
always gave they seemed to sparkle
through every nerve and muscle only a
minute or two did the green dwarf allow
us and he checked us as we were about
to don our clothing and let me note
that we had long been provided with
al necessary garments to replace our
own

  i would indeed gladly have donned
the outer costume of the place save that
larry had clung to his uniform and so
i kept also to my knickerbockers my
stockings and my canvas shoes compro-
mising however with a murian tunic
above them in the place of my american
shirt

  then to my intense embarrassment
without warning two of the black-haired
irls entered bearing robes of a peculiar
dull-blue hue at our manifest discomfort

radors bellow of laughter roared out
he took the garments from the pair
motioned them to leave us and still
laughing threw one around me

  its texture was soft but decidedly
metallic like some blue metal spun to
the fineness of a spiders thread the gar-
ment buckled tightly at the throat was
girdled at the waist and below this
cincture fell to the floor its folds being
held together by a half-dozen looped
cords from the shoulders a hood re-
sembling a monks cowl

  rador cast this over my head it com-
pletely covered my face but was of
so transparent a texture that i could see
though somewhat mistily through it
finally he handed us both a pair of
long gloves of the same material and
high stockings the feet of which were
gloved-five-toed

  and again his laughter rang out at our
manifest surprise

  the priestess of the shining one does
not altogether trust the shining ones
voice he said at last and these are
to guard against any sudden-errors and
fear not goodwin he went on kindly
not for the shining one itself would
yolara see harm come to larree here
-nor because of him to you but i would
not stake much on her heart toward the
double tongue whom lugur has claimed
nor to the great white one and for the
last i am sorry for him i do like well

  are they to be with us asked larry
eagerly

  they are to be where we go replied
the dwarf soberly for double tongue
there is no more peril than for you lugur
stands with him but for the other-
he was silent

  grimly larry reached down and drew
from his uniform his automatic he popped
a fresh clip into the pocket fold of his
girdle the pistol he slung high up be-
neath his armpit now okeefe had cau-
tioned me against revealing my weapon
and had up till now kept his own con-
cealed

  when we do need em were certain


famous fantastic mysteries

to have a bunch of odds against us doc
he had said and the element of surprise
will be mighty valuable to us keep em
under cover till we have to use em then
shoot straight

  therefore i wondered why larry was
showing his hand the green dwarf looked
at the weapon curiously okeefe tapped
it and as he spoke i understood

  listen rador he said i like you
and i believe you like us

  the dwarf nodded emphatically

  this said larry slays quicker than
the keth i take it so no harm shall come
to the blue-eyed one whose name is olaf
if i should raise it be you not in its
way rador he added significantly

  the dwarf nodded again his eyes
sparkling he thrust a hand out to both
of us

  a change comes he said what it
is i know not nor how it will fall but
this remember--rador is more friend to
you than you yet can know and now
let us go he ended abruptly

he led us not through the entrance
but into a sloping passage ending
in a blind wall touched a symbol graven
there and it opened precisely as had
the rosy barrier of the moon pool cham-
ber and just as there but far smaller
was a passage end a low curved wall
facing a shaft not black as had been
that abode of living darkness but faintly
luminescent rador leaned over the wall

  okeefe winked at me the mechanism
clicked and started the door swung shut
the sides of the car slipped into place
and we swept swiftly down the passage
overhead the wind whistled rador turned
toward us

  have no fear he began and then
for the green dwarf was keen was aware
without doubt of our lack of surprise
he started again to speak shrugged his
shoulders and turned his back our speed
was great and the journey not long in
a few moments the moving platform be-
gan to slow down it stopped in a closed
chamber no larger than itself

  rador scanned the wall before him and
then finding what he sought although i
could see nothing on its smooth surface
drew his poniard and struck twice with
its hilt immediately a panel moved away
revealing a space filled with faint misty
blue radiance and at each side of the
opened portal stood four of the dwarfish
men gray-headed old clad in a flowing
garment of white each pointing toward
us a short silver rod

  rador drew from his girdle a ring and
held it out to the first dwarf he ex-
amined it lowered his rod handed it
to the one beside him and not until each
had examined the ring did each lower his
curious weapon containers of that ter-
rific energy they called the keth i
thought

  we stepped out the doors closed be-
hind us the place was weird enough its
pave was a greenish-blue stone resembling
lapis lazuli on each side were high
pedestals holding carved figures of the
same material there were perhaps a score
of these but in the mistiness i could not
make out their outlines a droning rush-
ing roar beat upon our ears filled the
whole cavern

  i smell the sea said larry suddenly

  and then i too realized that the tang
of ocean was strong i felt its moisture
upon my face and hands rador spoke
again to the leader of-the priests-as
i now began to think them four leading
the way and four following us we marched
forward the floor arose gradually and
the rushing roar grew louder the sea
breath stronger

  and now the roaring became deep-toned
clamorous and close in front of us a rift
opened twenty feet in width it cut the
cavern floor and vanished into the blue
mist on each side the priests leading us
knelt rador imitating them okeefe
nudged me and we too dropped to our
knees we arose and went forward be-
fore us the cleft was spanned by one
solid slab of rock not more than two yards
wide it had neither railing nor other
protection
---

-

the conquest of the moon pool



  the four leading priests inarched out
upon it one by one and we followed in
the middle of the span they stopped and
again we knelt ten feet beneath us
was a torrent of blue sea-water racing
with prodigious speed between polished
walls it gave the impression of vast depth
it roared as it sped by and far to the
right was a low arch through which it
disappeared

  it was so swift that its surface shone
like polished blue steel and from it came
the blessed our worldly familiar ocean
breath that strengthened my soul amaz-
ingly and made me realize how earth-sick
i was larry too drew himself up draw-
ing deep breaths rador uttered a curious
phrase-it loses in translation its peculiar
picturesqueness

  the holy cord of the navel of the
great waters is the closest i can come
to it

  whence came the stream i marveled
forgetting for the moment as we passed
on again all else were we closer to the
surface of the earth than i had thought
or was this some mighty stream falling
through an opening in sea floor heaven
alone knew how many miles above us
losing itself in deeper abysses beyond
these how near and how far this was
from the truth i was to learn and never
did truth come to man in more dreadful
guise

  the roaring fell away the blue haze
lessened in front of us stretched a wide
flight of steps huge as those which had

let us into the courtyard of nan-tanach
through the ruined sea-gate we scaled it
it narrowed from above light poured
through a still narrower opening side by
side larry and i passed out of it

how can i describe what i saw
two things there are before which
i falter--to picture that temple of the
shining one as it first met our eyes in
all its incredible immensity and what
happened there and that thing to come
to pass that twilight of the gods in the
abode of the silent ones on the sea of
crimson but i must attempt it knowing
full well that it is impossible to make
clear one-tenth of their grandeur their
awfulness their soul-shaking terror

  we had emerged upon an enormous
platform of what seemed to be glistening
ivory it stretched before us for a hun-
dred yards or more and then shelved
gently into the white waters opposite
not a mile away was that prodigious web
of woven rainbows rador had called the
curtain of the shining one there it
shone in all its unearthly grandeur on
each side of the cyclopean pillars as
though a mountain should stretch up arms
raising between them a fairy banner of
auroral glories-in front the curved
simitar sweep of the pier with its clustered
gleaming temples

  before that brief fascinated glance was
done there dropped upon my soul a sen-
sation as of brooding weight intolerable
a spiritual oppression as though some


famous fantastic mysteries

vastness was falling pressing stifling me
i turned and larry caught me as i
reeled

  steady steady old man he whis-
pered

   at first all that my staggering conscious-
ness could realize was an immensity an
immeasurable uprearing that brought with
it the same throat-gripping vertigo as
comes from gazing downward from some
great height then a blur of white faces
intolerable shinings of hundreds upon
thousands of eyes huge incredibly huge
a colossal amphitheater of jet a stupen-
dous semi-circle held within its mighty
arc the ivory platform on which i stood

  it reared itself almost perpendicularly
hundreds of feet up into the sparkling
heavens and thrust down on each side
its ebon bulwarks like monstrous paws
now the giddiness from its sheer great-
ness passing i saw that it was indeed
an amphitheater sloping slightly backward
tier after tier and that the white blur
of faces against its blackness the gleam-
ing of countless eyes were those of myriads
of the people who sat silent flower-gar-
landed their gaze focused upon the rain-
bow curtain and sweeping over me like
a torrent-tangible appalling

  five hundred feet beyond the smooth
high retaining wall of the amphitheater
raised itself above it was the first terrace
of seats and above this dividing the
tiers for another half a thousand feet
upward set within them like a panel was
a dead-black surface in which shone faintly
with a bluish radiance a gigantic disk
above it and around it a cluster of in-
numerable smaller ones

  on each side of me bordering the plat-
form were scores of small pillared al-
coves a low wall stretching across their
fronts delicate fretted grills shielding
them save -where in each lattice an open-
ing stared it came to me that they were
like those stalls in ancient gothic cathedrals
wherein for centuries had kneeled paladins
and people of my own race on earths
fair face

  and within these alcoves were gathered

score upon score theplfin beauties the
dwarfish men of the fair-haired folk at
my right a few feet from the opening
through which we had come a passage-
way led back between the fretted stalls
halfway between us and the massive base
of the amphitheater a dais rose up the
platform to it a wide ramp ascended and
on ramp and dais and along the center
of the gleaming platform down to where
it kissed the white waters a broad ribbon
of the radiant flowers lay like a fairy
carpet

  on one side of this meshed in a silken
web that hid no line or curve of her
sweet body white flesh gleaming through
its folds stood yolara and opposite her
crowned with a circlet of flashing blue
stones his mighty body stark bare was
lugur

  okeefe drew a long breath rador
touched my arm and still dazed i let
myself be drawn into the aisle and through
a corridor that ran behind the alcoves
at the back of one of these the green
dwarf paused opened a door and mo-
tioned us within

  entering i found that we were exactly
opposite where the ramp ran up to the
dais and that yolara was not more than
fifty feet away she glanced at okeefe
and smiled i noted her extraordinary
exhilaration her eyes were ablaze with
little dancing points of light her body
seemed to palpitate the rounded delicate
muscles beneath the translucent skin
seemed to run with little eager waves
she seemed-what is the word the scotch
use-fey suddenly larry whistled softly

  theres von hetzdorp he said

  i looked where he pointed opposite
us sat the german clothed as we were
he was leaning forward his eyes eager
behind his glasses but if he saw us he
gave no sign

  and theres olaf said okeefe

  beneath the carved stall in which sat
the german was an aperture unprotected
by pillars or by grills opening clear upon
the platform near it stretched the trail
of flowers up to the great dais which lugur
the conquest of the moon pool



the voice and yolara the priestess guarded
nor was olaf clad as we his mighty torso
covered with a white tunic stuffed into
his old dungarees his feet bare he sat
immobile staring out toward the prismatic
veil and in his eyes even at that dis-
tance i could see a flare of consuming
hatred so he sat alone and my heart
went out to him

  okeefes face softened

  bring him here he said to rador

  the green dwarf was looking at the
norseman too a shade of pity upon his
mocking face he shook his head

  wait he said you can do nothing
now and it may be there will be no need
to do anything he added but i could
feel that there was little of conviction in
his words

chapter xx

the madness of olaf

yolara drew herself up threw her
white arms high from the moun-
tainous tiers came a mighty sigh a ripple
ran through them and upon the moment
before yolaras arms fell there issued ap-
parently from the air around us a peal
of sound that might have been the shout-
ing of some playful god hurling great
suns through the net of stars it was like
the deepest notes of all the organs in the
world combined in one summoning ma-
jestic cosmic

  it held within it the thunder of the
spheres rolling through the infinite the
birth-song of suns made manifest in the
womb of space echoes of creations su-
pernal chord it shook the body like a
pulse from the heart of the universe-
pulsed-and died away

  on its death came a blaring as of al
the trumpets of conquering hosts since
the first pharaoh led his swarms trium-
phal compelling alexanders clamoring
hosts brazen-throated wolf-horns of
caesars legions blare of trumpets of
genghis khan and his golden horde
clangor of the locust swarms of tamer-
lane bugles of napoleons armies--war-

shout of all earths conquerors and il
died

  fast upon it a throbbing muffled
tumult of harp sounds mellownesses of
myriads of wood horns the subdued sweet
shrilling of multitudes of flutes pandean
pipings-inviting carrying with them the
calling of waterfalls in the hidden place
rushing brooks and murmuring forest
winds-calling calling languorous lulling
dripping into the brain like the very-
honeyed essence of sound

  and after them a silence in which the
memory of the music seemed to beat to
beat ever more faintly through every
quivering nerve

  from me all fear all apprehension
had fled in their place was nothing but
joyous anticipation a supernal freedom
from even the shadow of the shadow of
care or sorrow not now did anything
matter-olaf or his haunted hate-filled
eyes throckmartin or his fate nothing
of pain nothing of agony nothing of
striving nor endeavor nor despair in that
wide outer world that had turned sud-
denly to a troubled dream

  and in that moment as the muscles
of my face grew rigid with inhuman emo-
tion in my subconsciousness stirred under-
standing of that element in the murians
that had so perplexed me for what to
those who experienced in such sounds the
emotions of universal nature herself could
be either the joys or sorrows of mankind
and yet-

  my eyes sought the crowded tiers sens-
ing there in multitudinous form the same
reaction of those stupendous vibrations
that had so shaken me-and yet-again
that furtive doubt-

  once more the first great note pealed
out as once more it died from the
clustered spheres a kaleidoscopic blaze
shot as though drawn from the majestic
sound itself the many-colored rays darted
across the white waters and sought the
face of the irised veil as they touched
it sparkled flamed wavered and shook
with fountains of prismatic color

  the light increased and in its intensity


famous fantastic mysteries

the silver air darkened faded into shadow
that white mosaic of flower-crowned faces
set in the amphitheater of jet and vast
shadows dropped upon the high-flung
tiers and shrouded them but on the skirts
of the rays the fretted stalls in which
we sat with the fair-haired ones blazed
out iridescent like jewels

  i was sensible of an acceleration of every
pulse a wild stimulation of every nerve
i felt myself being lifted above the world
-close to the threshold of the high gods
-soon their essence and their power would
stream out into me i glanced at larry
his face was transformed he was like
balder the beautiful wonderful as one
of those olden half gods of his own be-
loved isle his eyes were wild with life
and yolara-i cannot describe her but as
her face turned toward his i saw in the
joy of her own eyes infernal allure and
a passion withering

  i looked at olaf and in his face was
none of this only hate and hate and
hate

  the peacock waves streamed out over
the waters cleaving the seeming darkness
a rainbow path of glory and the veil
flashed as though all the rainbows that
had ever shone were burning within it
again the mighty sound pealed

  into the center of the veil the light
drew itself grew into an intolerable bright-
ness and with a storm of tinklings a
tempest of crystalline notes a tumult of
tiny chimings through it sped-the shin-
ing one

straight down that radiant path
its high-flung plumes of feathery
flame shimmering its coruscating spirals
whirling its seven globes of seven colors
shining above its glowing core it raced
toward us the hurricane of bells of dia-
mond glass were jubilant joyous i felt
okeefe grip my arm yolara threw her
white arms out in a welcoming gesture

i heard from the tiers a sigh of rapture
-and in it poignant wailing undertone
of agony

  and over the waters down the light

stream to the end of the ivory pier flew
the shining one through its crystal piz-
zicatr drifted inarticulate murmurings
deadly sweet stilling the heart and setting
it leaping madly

  for a moment it paused poised itself
and then came whirling down the flower
path to its priestess slowly ever more
slowly it passed olaf and i saw his
hands clench until the knuckles whitened
saw his mighty chest swell with the ter-
rific restrained impulse to leap out upon
it

  it passed hovered for a moment between
the woman and the dwarf as though
contemplating them turned to her with
its storm of tinklings softened its mur-
murings infinitely caressing bent toward
it yolara seemed to gather within herself
pulsing waves of power she was terrifying
gloriously maddeningly evil and as
gloriously maddeningly heavenly aphro-
dite and the virgin tanith of the car-
thaginians and st bride of the isles
succubus and angel a queen of hell
and a princess of heaven in one

  only for a moment did that which we
had called the dweller and that these
named the shining one pause it swept
up the ramp to the dais rested there
slowly turning plumes and spirals lacing
and unlacing throbbing pulsing now its
nucleus grew plainer stronger-human in
a fashion and all inhuman neither man
nor woman neither god nor devil subtly
partaking of all nor could i doubt that
whatever it was within that shining
nucleus was something sentient something
that had will and energy and in some
awful supernormal fashion-intelligence

  another trumpeting-a sound of stones
opening-a long low wail of utter anguish
something moved shadowy in the river
of light and slowly at first then ever
more rapidly shapes swam through it
there were half a score of them-girls
and youths women and men and i knew
that these were sacrifices thrust out to
the god as they drew on the shining
one poised itself regarded them they
drew closer and in the eyes of each and
-

                                                                          -

the conquest of the moon pool	

in their faces was the bud of that strange
intermingling of emotions of joy and sor-
row ecstasy and terror that i had seen
in full blossom on throckmartins

   the thing began again its murmurings
now infinitely caressing coaxing-like the
song of a siren from some witched star
and the bell sounds rang out-compel-
lingly calling-calling-calling-

   i saw olaf lean far out of his place
saw half-consciously at lugurs signal
three of the dwarfs creep in and take place
unnoticed behind him but in the fire of
my interest the sight was burned instan-
taneously from my mind

   now the first of the swift figures rushed
upon the dais and paused but only for
a moment it was the girl who had been
brought before yolara when the gnome
named songar was driven into nothing-
ness with all the quickness of light a
spiral of the shining one stretched out
and encircled her

  at its touch there was an infinitely
dreadful shrinking and it seemed a simul-
taneous hurling of herself into its radi-
ance and as it wrapped its swirls around
her permeated her the crystal chorus
burst forth tumultuously through and
through her the radiance pulsed

   began then that infinitely dreadful but
infinitely glorious rhythm they called the
dance of the shining one and as the girl
swirled within its sparkling mists another
and another flew into its embrace until
at last the dais was an incredible vision
a mad stars witches sabbath phantas-
magoric macaberesque an altar of white
faces and bodies gleaming through living
flame transfused with rapture insupport-
able and horror that was hellish and ever
radiant plumes and spirals expanding the
core of the shining one waxed growing
greater as it consumed as it drew into
and through itself the life-force of these
lost ones

   so they spun there interlaced souls
caught in the monstrous web and there
began to pulse from them life vitality
as though the very essence of natufjt was
filling us dimly i recognized that what

i was beholding was vampirism incon-
ceivable the banked tiers chanted the
mighty sounds pealed forth it was a
saturnalia of demigods-yolara trans-
formed beyond semblance of earth-her
beauty flaring out into unholy and devil-
ish and at once holy and wondrous ful-
filment impossible to tell

  whirling murmuring bell-notes storm-
ing the shining one began to pass from
the dais down the ramp still embracing
still interwoven with those who had thrown
themselves into its spirals they drew along
with it as though half carried in dreadful
dance white faces sealed forever-into
that semblance of those who held within
linked god and devil i covered my eyes

  and the shining one passed-passed on
-was beside olaf-

  i heard a gasp from okeefe opened
my eyes and sought his saw the madness
depart from them as he strained forward
olaf had leaned far out and as he did so
two of the dwarfs beside him caught him
and whether by design or through his
own swift involuntary movement thrust
him half into the dwellers path the
dweller paused in its gyrations-seemed
to watch him

  the norsemans face was crimson his
eyes blazing he threw himself back and
with one mad defiant shout gripped one
of the dwarfs about the middle and sent
him hurtling through the air straight at
the radiant thing a whirling mass of legs
and arms the dwarf flew-then in mid-
flight stopped as though some gigantic in-
visible hand had caught him and-was
dashed--it came to me as one would dash
a great spider with prodigious force
down upon the platform not a yard from
the shining one

  and like a broken spider he moved
feebly once twice from the dweller
shot a shimmering tentacle-touched him
-recoiled its crystal tinklings changed
into an angry chiming from all about-
jeweled stalls and jet peak-came a sigh
of incredulous horror

  and all the while those dead-alive who
had danced with the shining one turned


famous fantastic mysteries

slowly within its sparkling mist faces
devoid of all human semblance turning
slowly turning in its coruscating net-
chatoyant-like fireflies in gleaming swirl-
ing mist-god

  god the echo of an invocation came
from okeefe olaf threw him short
but i knew that was not what had stopped
his flight

  lugur his face gray all exaltation gone
from it leaped forward on the instant
larry was over the low barrier between
the pillars rushing to the norsemans side
and even as they ran there was another
wild shout from olaf and he hurled him-
self out straight at the throat of the
dweller

  but before he could touch the shining
one now motionless-and never was the
thing more horrible than then with the
purely human suggestion of surprise plain
in its poise-larry had struck him aside

  i tried to follow and was held by
rador he was trembling but not with
fear in his face was incredulous hope
inexplicable eagerness

  wait he said wait

the shining one stretched out a slow
spiral and as it did so i saw the
bravest thing man has ever witnessed
instantly okeefe thrust himself between
it and olaf pistol out the tentacle
touched him and the dull blue of his robe
flashed out into blinding intense azure
light from the automatic in his gloved
hand came three quick bursts of flame
straight into the thing the dweller drew
back the bell-sounds swelled angrily

  and all that time its prey unheeding
white-faced transfigured-turned-turned
slowly on its radiant web can i ever
forget

  then i saw lugur pause his hand
darted up and in it was one of the silver
keth cones but before he could flash it
upon the norseman larry had unlooped
his robe thrown its fold over olaf and
holding him with one hand away from
the shining one thrust with the other his
pistol into the dwarfs stomach his lips

moved but i could not hear what he said
butjuigur seemed to understand for his
hand dropped

  now yolara was there-all this had
taken barely more than five seconds she
thrust herself between the three men and
the apparition of which she was priestess
she spoke to it and the wild buzzing
died down the gay crystal tinklings burst
forth again the thing murmured to her
began to whirl faster faster it passed
down the ivory pier out upon the waters
bearing with it meshed in its light the
sacrifice it swept on ever more swiftly
triumphantly - and vanished turning
turning with its ghastly crew through the
veil

 abruptly the polychromatic path
snapped out the silver light poured in
upon us from all the amphitheater arose
a clamor a shouting von hetzdorp his
eyes staring was leaning out listening
unrestrained now by rador i vaulted the
wall and rushed forward but not before
i had heard the green dwarf murmur
there is something stronger than the
shining one two things-yea-a strong
heart-and hate

  olaf panting eyes glazed trembling
shrank beneath my hand

  the devil that took my helma i
heard him whisper the shining devil
both these men lugur was raging
they shall dance with the shining one
and this one too he pointed at me
malignantly

  this man is mine said the priestess
and her voice was icily menacing she
rested her hand on larrys shoulder he
shall not dance no-nor shall his friend
i have told you i care not for this one
she pointed to olaf

  neither this man nor this said larry
his pistol still pressed against lugur shall
be harmed this is my word yolara
she looked at him

  even so she said quietly my lord
lugurs eyes grew hellish and i saw
von hetzdorp stare at okeefe with a
new a curiously speculative interest

  i have said it she turned to lugur
the conquest of the moon pool



what can you do she added quite
insolently

  he raised his arms as though to strike
her her hand swept to her bosom lar-
rys pistol prodded him rudely enough

  no rough stuff now kid said okeefe
in english the red dwarf quivered turned
-caught a robe from a priest standing by
and threw it over himself the ladala
shouting gesticulating fighting with the
soldiers were jostling down from the tiers
of jet

  come commanded yolara-her eyes
rested upon larry your heart is great
indeed my lord she murmured and her
voice was very sweet come

  this man comes with us yolara said
okeefe pointing to olaf

  bring him she said what you have
done and what may come from what
you have done i know not she laughed
but compared to what i think that will
be this man is but a straw in a torrent
so bring him only tell him to look no
more upon me as before she added
fiercely

  beside her the three of us passed along
the stalls where sat the fair-haired now
silent at gaze as though in the grip of
some great doubt silently olaf strode
beside me rador had disappeared down
the stairway through the hall of turquoise
mist over the rushing sea-stream we went
and stood beside the wall through which
we had entered the white-robed ones had
fled

  yolara pressed the portal opened we
stepped upon the car yolara took the
lever the walls flashed by-and dazed
troubled i at least more than half-in-
credulous as to the reality of it all we
sped through the faintly luminous corridor
to the house of the priestess

  and as we sped i too wondered what
it was that olaf had done and what was
to come of it

  but one thing i wondered about no
more sick at heart and soul the truth
had come to me no more need to search
or throckmartin behind that veiljn the
lair of the dweller dead-alive like those

we had just seen swim in its shining train
was he and edith stanton and thora
and olaf huldrickssons wife

chapter xxi

the ladala are awake

no word was spoken during the swift
journey the webs that clothed yo-
lara streamed out behind her like little
filmy pennons she stared ahead strangely
exalted brows drawn in one delicate line
above eyes now deepest blue okeefe
watched her and from his beauty-loving
soul one could see admiration creep up and
stand at gaze upon olafs grim face a
shade of greater grimness fell his jaw
hardened whatever larrys change of
heart might be i thought it found no
echo in the norsemans breast

dr goodwins sketch of a frog man made while
watching the ceremonies described in his narrative

   the car came to rest the portal opened
yolara leaped out lightly beckoned and
flitted up the corridor she paused before
an ebon screen at a touch it vanished re-
vealing an entrance to a small blue cham-
ber glowing as though cut from the heart


famcftjs fantastic mysteries

of some gigantic sapphire bare save that
in its center upon a low pedestal stood
a great globe fashioned from milky rock-
crystal upon its surface were faint trac-
ings as of seas and continents but if so
either of some other world or of this
world in immemorial past for in no way
did they resemble the mapped coast lines
of our earth

  poised upon the globe rising from it out
into space locked in each others arms
lips to lips were two figures a woman
and a man so exquisite so lifelike that
for the moment i failed to realize that
they too were carved of the crystal and
before this shrine-for nothing else could
it be i knew-three slender cones raised
themselves one of purest white flame
one of opalescent water and the third of
-moonlight there was no mistaking
them the height of a tall man each stood
but how water flame and light were held
so evenly so steadily in their spire-shapes
i could not tell

  before this shrine yolara bowed lowly
-once twice thrice she turned to
okeefe nor by slightest look or gesture
betrayed she knew others were there than
he the blue eyes wide searching unfath-
omable she drew close put white hands
on his shoulders looked down into his
very soul-and i saw a shadow dim their
azure brilliance

  not yet she whispered not yet is
your heart mine she was silent again
for a space regarding him

  my lord at last she murmured now
listen well for i yolara offer you three
things myself and the shining one and
the power that is the shining ones yea
and still a fourth thing that is all three
power over all upon that world from
whence ye came these my lord ye shall
have i swear it-she turned toward the
altar uplifted her arms-by siva and by
siyana and by the flame by the water
and by the light

  she bent toward him once more drew
still closer

  not yet is that heart of yours mine
she repeated softly yet shall it be and

that too i swear by siya and by siyana
and by the flame by the water and by the
lightl

  her eyes grew purple dark and let
none dare to take you from me nor ye go
from me unbidden  she whispered fiercely

  and then swiftly still ignoring us she
threw her arms about okeefe pressed her
white body to his breast lips raised eyes
closed seeking his okeefes arms tight-
ened around her his head dropped lips
seeking finding hers-passionately from
olaf came a deep indrawn breath that was
almost a groan but not in my heart could
i find blame for the irishman

  the priestess opened eyes now all misty
blue thrust him back stood regarding
him okeefe face dead-white raised a
trembling hand to his face

  and thus have i sealed my oath o my
lord she whispered for the first time
she seemed to recognize our presence
stared at us a moment and then through
us turned to okeefe

  go now she said soon rador shall
come for you then-well after that let
happen what will

  she smiled once more at him so sweetly
turned toward the figures upon the great
globe sank upon her knees before them
quietly we crept away in utter silence
we passed through the anteroom still de-
serted found the head of the mosaicked
path and still silent made our way to
the little pavilion

  but as we passed along we heard a
tumult from the green roadway shouts of
men now and then a womans scream
through a rift in the garden i glimpsed
a jostling crowd on one of the bridges
green dwarfs struggling with the ladala
and all about droned a humming as of
a gfent hive disturbed

larry threw himself down upon one
of the divans covered his face with
his hands dropped them to catch in
olafs eyes troubled reproach looked at
me

   couldnt help it he said half-defi-
antly half-miserably god what a
jlhljpiliili		 

the conquest of the moon pool	

woman i couldnt help it he walked
about the room restlessly what do you
suppose she meant by offering me that
shining devil they worship in this cross-
section of beautiful hell he demanded
halting and what did she mean about
power over all the world

  larry i said why didnt you tell
her you didnt love her then

  he gazed at me the old twinkle back
in his eye

  spoken like a scientist doc he ex-
claimed i suppose if a burning angel
struck you out of nowhere and threw itself
about you you would most dignifiedly
tell it you didnt want to be burned for
gods sake dont talk nonsense good-
win he ended almost peevishly

  but if it was a bad angel a beautiful
devil-djaevelsk-and she should come to
you and you know her a devil and your
soul the price of her kisses-would you
kiss or slay her thus olaf heavily
sadly larrv glanced at him troubled

  evil evil the norsemans voice
was deep nearly a chant all here is of
evil troldom and helvede it is ja and
that she djaevelsk of beauty what is she
but harlot of that shining devil they wor-
ship i olaf huldicksson know what she
meant when she held out to you power
over all the world ja as if the world had
not devils enough in it now

  what the cry came from both
okeefe and myself at once

  ja said olaf i have heard i have
listened to that trolde lugur and to von
hetzdorp they did not know i could un-
derstand them-no i crept about and lis-
tened and i know ja evil all evil
that woman and helvede snarling at these
gates mad to be loosed on our world
above 

  wed better just forget why i kissed
the lady and hear what olafs got to say
doc said okeefe

  it was when the woman the wonder-
witch broke-adsprede-the oldster-
began olaf he stopped peering down
the path-made a gesture of caution re-
lapsed into sullen silence there were foot-

steps on the path and into sight came
rador but a rador changed gone was
every vestige of his mockery his face all
serious curiously solemn he saluted
okeefe and olaf with that salute which
before this i had seen given only to yo-
lara and to lugur there came from far-
away a swift quickening of the tumult

  the ladala are awake he said so
much for what two brave men can do
he paused thoughtfully bones and dust
jostle not each other for place against the
grave wall he added oddly but if
bones and dust have revealed to them that
they still-live-

  he stopped abruptly eyes seeking the
globe that bore and sent forth speech

  the afyo maie has sent me to watch
over you till she summons you he an-
nounced clearly a vestige of raillery flit-
ted over his face there is to be a feast
you larree you goodwin are to come
i remain here with olaf

  no harm to him broke in okeefe
sharply rador touched his heart his eyes

  by the ancient ones and by my love
for you and by what you twain did before
the shining one i swear it he answered
okeefe satisfied thrust him his hand

  rador clasped palms a soldier came
round the path in his grip a long flat box
of polished wood the green dwarf took it
dismissed him threw open the lid

  here is your apparel for the feast lar-
ree he said pointing to the contents

  okeefe stared reached down and drew
out a white shimmering softly metallic
long-sleeved tunic a broad silvery girdle
leg swathings of the same argent material
and sandals that seemed to be cut out
from silver he made a quick gesture of
angry dissent

  nay larree whispered the dwarf
wear them i counsel it i pray it ask
me not why he went on swiftly looking
again at the globe

  okeefe as i was impressed by his
earnestness the dwarf made a curiously
expressive pleading gesture okeefe ab-
ruptly took the garments passed into the
room of the fountain


famous fantastic mysteries

  what is the feast rador i asked
the shining one dances not again i
added

  no he said no-he hesitated-it
is the usual feast that follows the-sacra-
ment lugur and double tongue who
came with you will be there he added
slowly

  lugur i gasped in astonishment
after what happened he will be there

  perhaps because of what happened
goodwin my friend he answered his
eyes again full of malice and there will
be others friends of yolara friends of
lugur and perhaps another his voice
was almost inaudible one whom they
have not called he halted half-fearfully
glancing at the globe put finger to lips and
spread himself out upon one of the couches

  strike up the band came okeefes
voice here comes the hero

  the curtains parted and he strode into
the room i am bound to say that the ad-
miration in radors eyes was reflected in
my own and even if involuntarily in
olafs for in the gleaming silver garb the
irishman was truly splendid long lithe
clean-limbed his keen dark face smiling
he shone in contrast with rador and
would i knew be among those other
dwarfish men as was cuchullin son of
lerg and beloved of the dark queen
scathach among the pictish trolls

  a son for siyana whispered rador
a child of siya- who  wondered
were these twain whose names had been
uttered so holily by yolara and now by
the green dwarf-with far far more rever-
ence than they spoke of the shining one
siya and siyana typified worldly love
their ritual was however singularly free
from those degrading elements usually
found in love-cults their youthful priests
and priestesses were selected from the
most beautiful children of the ruling class
and at the age of nineteen the girls and
at the age of twenty-one the youths were
automatically released from their service
taking if they desired mates over all was
thanaroa remote unheeding but still
maker and ruler of all rador was an ex-

ception in his reverence for the ancient
ones

the green dwarf knelt took from his
girdle-pouch a silk-wrapped something
unwound it and still kneeling drew out
a slender poniard of gleaming white metal
hilted with the blue scintillating stones
stretching out a long arm he thrust it into
okeefes girdle then gave him again the
rare salute before he could rise the tripod
globe chimed swam with its film of racing
colors whispered the dwarf listened

  i hear he said its humming stopped
the crawling colors stilled you know the
way he turned to okeefe and to me
he followed us to the head of the pathway

  now he said grimly let the silent
ones show their power if thev still have
it

  and with this strange benediction per-
plexing me we passed on

  for heavens sake larry i urged as
we approached the house of the priestess
youll be careful

  he nodded but i saw with a little
deadly pang of apprehension in my heart
a puzzled lurking doubt within his eyes

 there were many guards about the
place far more than i had ever seen before
they stood at attention along the bowered
path and just before we reached the por-
tal of the palace a dozen of them mani-
festly awaiting us stepped forward they
saluted then formed on each side of us
a guard of honor

  as we ascended the serpent steps von
hetzdorp suddenly appeared the blue
robes were gone he was clothed in gay
green tunic and leg-swathings and odd
enough he looked in them with his owl-
rimmed spectacels and his pointed teu-
tonic beard he gave a signal to our
guards and i wondered what influence the
german had attained for promptly with-
out question they drew aside at me he
smiled amiably

  it is goot to see you again dr good-
win he said no doubt you have been
observing much you and i will have much
to say to each other yes
the conquest of the moon pool



  friendly as were the words in them
was something furtively menacing

  have you found your friends yet
he went on and now i sensed something
more deeply sinister in him no it is
too bad well dont give up hope i have
an idea olaf will find his wife before
you find professor throckmartin ja
his lips curled in a vulpine grin what
was the man hinting what was he driving
at

  he turned to okeefe

  lieutenant i would like to speak to
you-alone 

  ive no secrets from goodwin an-
swered okeefe

  so queried von hetzdorp suavely
he bent whispered to larry

  the irishman started eyed him with
a certain shocked incredulity then turned
to me

  just a minute doc he said and i
caught the suspicion of a wink they
drew aside out of ear-shot the german
talked rapidly larry was all attention
von hetzdorps earnestness became in-
tense okeefe interrupted-appeared to
question

  von hetzdorp glanced at me then and
as his gaze shifted from okeefe i saw
a hot flame of rage and horror blaze dp in
the latters eyes

  at last okeefe appeared to consider
gravely nodded as though he had arrived
at some decision and von hetzdorp fairly
beaming with delight and satisfaction
thrust his hand to him and only i could
have noticed larrys shrinking his micro-
scopic hesitation before he took it and
his involuntary movement as though to
shake off something unclean when the
clasp had ended

  von hetzdorp without another look at
me turned and went quickly within the
guards took their places and we passed on
to face whatever it was that fate held for
us

  i looked at larry inquiringly

  dont ask a thing now doc he said
tensely wait till we get damnett busy
and quick-ill tell you that now-

chapter xxii

the tempting of larry

we paused before thick curtains
through which came the faint mur-
mur of many voices they parted out
came two ushers i suppose they were
that in cuirasses and kilts that reminded
me somewhat of chain-mail-the first
armor of any kind here that i had seen
they held open the folds bowed and as
we entered fell in behind us

  the chamber on whose threshold we
stood was far larger than either anteroom
or hall of audience not less than three
hundred feet long and half that in depth
from end to end of it ran two huge semi-
circular tables paralleling each other di-
vided by a wide aisle and heaped with
flowers with fruits with viands unknown
to me and glittering with crystal flagons
beakers goblets of as many hues as the
blooms and on the gay-cushioned couches
that flanked the tables lounging luxuri-
ously were scores of the members of the
ruling class

  their eyes were turned upon us and
there rose a little buzz of admiration oddly
mixed with a half-startled amaze as their
gaze fell upon okeefe in all his silvery
magnificence everywhere the light-giving
globes sent their roseate radiance

  the cuirassed dwarfs led us through
the aisle within the arc of the inner half-
circle was another glittering board an
oval

  but of those seated there and facing
us i had eyes for only one-yolara she
swayed up to greet okeefe and she was
like one of those white lily maids whose
beauty hoang-ku the sage says made
the gobi first a paradise and whose lusts
later the burned-out desert that it is she
held out hands to larry and on her face
was passion-unashamed unhiding

  she was circe-but circe conquered
webs of filmiest white clung to the roseleaf
body like rosy morning mists about a
nymph of diana twisted through the
cornsilk hair a threaded circlet of pale
sapphires shone but they were pale beside


famous fantastic mysteries

yolaras eyes okeefe bent kissed her
hands something more than mere admira-
tion flaming from him she saw-and
laughing drew him down beside her

  it came to me that of all only these
two yolara and okeefe were in white-
and i wondered then with a stiffening of
nerves i ceased to wonder as there entered
-lugur he was all in scarlet and as he
strode forward the voices were still a
silence fell-a tense strained silence

  his gaze turned upon yolara rested
upon okeefe and instantly his face grew
dreadful there is no other word for it
satan losing heaven and finding an
usurper on his throne in hell could have
held in his eyes no more of devilish malig-
nity

  i had not noticed von hetzdorp but
now i saw him lean forward from the
center of the table near whose end i sat
touch lugur and whisper to him swiftly
with an appalling effort the dwarf con-
trolled himself took his place at the further
end of the oval

  and now i noted that the figures
between were the seven of that council of
which the shining ones priestess and
voice were the heads

  my gaze ran back the end of the room
was draped with the exquisitely colored
graceful curtains looped with gorgeous
garlands between curtains and table
where sat larry and the nine a circular
platform perhaps ten yards in diameter
raised itself a few feet above the floor its
gleaming surface half-covered with the
luminous petals fragrant delicate

  on each side below it were low carven
stools the curtains parted and softly en-
tered girls bearing their flutes their harps
the curiously emotion-exciting octaved
drums they sank into their places they
touched their instruments a faint lan-
guorous measure throbbed through the rosy
air

  the stage was set what was to be the
play

  now about the tables passed other
dusky-haired maids fair bosoms bare their
scanty kirtles looped high pouring out the

wines for the feasters and gradually into
the voices of these crept the olden reckless-
ness the gaiety but lugur sat silent
brooding his face like that of some fallen
god and i sensed behind the prisoning
bars of his calm a monstrous striving of
evil struggling to be free

  my eyes sought okeefe whatever it
had been that von hetzdorp had said
clearly it now filled his mind-even to the
exclusion of the wondrous woman beside
him his eyes were stern cold and now
and then as he turned them toward the
german filled with a curious speculation
yolara watched him frowned gave a low
order to the hebe behind her

  the girl disappeared entered again with
a ewer that seemed cut of amber the
priestess poured from it into larrys glass
a clear liquid that shook with tiny sparkles
of light she raised the glass to her lips
handed it to him half-smiling half-ab-
stractedly he took it touched his own
lips where hers had kissed drained it a
nod from yolara and the maid refilled his
goblet

  at once there was a swift transformation
in the irishman his abstraction vanished
the watchfulness the sternness fled his
eyes sparkled he looked upon yolara with
seemingly a new vision leaned caressingly
toward her whispered her blue eyes
flashed triumphantly her chiming laughter
rang she raised her own glass but within
it was not that clear drink that filled
larrys and again he drained his own

  he arose face all reckless gaiety rol-
licking deviltry

  a toast he cried in english to the
shining one and may the hell where it
belongs soon claim it

he had used their own word for
their god-all else had been in his
own tongue and so fortunately they did
not understand but the intent of the con-
tempt in his action they did recognize-
and a dead a fearful silence fell upon them
all lugurs eyes blazed little sparks of
crimson in their green yolara reached up
caught at okeefe he seized the soft
the conquest of the moon pool



hand caressed it his gaze grew far away
somber

  the shining one he spoke low as
though to himself an now again i see
the faces of those who dance with it it
is the fires of mora come god alone
knows how from erin to this place the
fires of mora he contemplated the
hushed folk before him and then from his
lips came that weirdest most haunting
of the lyrics of erin-the curse of mora

  the fretted fires of mora blew oer him
      in the night

  he thrills  more to loving nor weeps
      for past delight

  for when those flames have bitten both
     grief and joy take flight-

  for when those flames have bitten both
     grief and joy take flight

  again yolara tried to draw him down
beside her and once more he gripped her
hand his eyes grew fixed he crooned

  and through the sleeping silence his feet
      must track the tune

  when the world is barred and speckled with
      silver of the moon-

  when the world is barred and speckled with
      silver of the moon

  he stood swaying for a moment and
then laughing let the priestess have her
way drained again the glass

  hear you the council and you lugur
and all who are here she cried now i
the priestess of the shining one take as
is my right my mate and this is he
she rose pointed down upon larry

  cant quite make out what you say
yolara he muttered thickly but say
anything you like i love your voice he
laughed glanced at lugur now upon his
feet forced calmness gone volcano-seeth-
ing dont be such a skeleton at the feast
old dear cried okeefe everybodys
merry and bright here

  i turned sick with dread yolaras hand
stole softly upon the irishmans curls
caressingly he drew it down kissed it

  you know the law yolara lugurs
voice was flat deadly you may not mate
with other than your own kind and this

man is a stranger-a barbarian-food for
the shining one literally he spat the
phrase

  no not of our kind lugur higher
yolara answered serenely lo higher
even than the ancient ones a son of
siya and of siyana 

  a lie roared the red dwarf a lie

  the shining one revealed it to me
said yolara sweetly and if ye believe
not lugur go ask the shining one if it be
not truth

  there was bitter nameless menace in
those last words and whatever their hid-
den message to lugur it was potent he
stood choking face hell-shadowed von
hetzdorp leaned out again whispered the
red dwarf bowed now wholly ironically
resumed his place and his silence and
again i wondered icy-hearted what was
the power the german had so to sway
lugur what was it that he had said to
okeefe and what plots and counter-
plots were hatching in that unscrupulous
brain

  what says the council yolara de-
manded turning to them

  only for a moment they consulted
among themselves then the woman whose
face was a ravaged shrine of beauty spoke

  the will of the priestess is the will
of the council she answered

  defiance died from yolaras face she
looked down at larry tenderly he sat
swaying crooning she clapped her hands
and one of the cuirassed dwarfs strode to
her

  bid the priests come she commanded
then turned to the silent room by the
rites of siya and siyana yolara takes their
son for her mate she said and again her
hand stole down possessingly serpent soft
to the drunken head of the okeefe

  the curtains parted widely through
them filed two by two twelve hooded fig-
ures clad in flowing robes of the green
one sees in forest vistas of opening buds
of dawning spring of each pair one bore
clasped to breast a globe of that milky
crystal i had seen in the sapphire shrine-
room the other a harp small shaped


famous fantastic mysteries

like the ancient clarsach of the druids

  two by two they stepped upon the
raised platform placed gently upon it each
their globe and two by two crouched be-
hind them they formed now a star of
six points about the petaled dais and si-
multaneously they drew from their faces
the covering cowls

  i half-rose from my feet-youth and
maidens these of the fair-haired all
young and youths and maids more beau-
tiful than any of those i had yet seen

  the ashen-gold of the maiden priest-
esses hair was wound about their brows
in shining coronals the pale locks of the
youths were clustered within circlets of
translucent glimmering gems like moon-
stones and then crystal globe alternately
before and harp alternately held tiy youth
and maid they began to sing

  what was that song i do not know
nor ever shall archaic ancient beyond
thought it seemed not with the ancient-
ness of things that for uncounted ages
have been but wind-driven dust rather
was it the ancientness of the golden youth
of the world love lilts of earth younglings
with light of new-born suns drenching
them chorals of young stars mating in
space murmurings of april gods and
goddesses a languor stole through me
the rosy lights upon the tripods began to
die away and as they faded the milky
globes gleamed forth brighter ever
brighter yolara rose stretched a hand to
larry led him through the sextuple
groups and stood face to face with him
in the center of their circle

the rose-light died all that immense
chamber was black save for the circle
of the glowing spheres within this their
milky radiance grew brighter-brighter
the song whispered away a throbbing
arpeggio dripped from the harps and as
the notes pulsed out up from the globes
as though striving to follow pulsed with
them tips of moon-fire cones such as i had
seen before yolaras altar weirdly caress-
ingly compellingly the harp notes throbbed
in repeated re-repeated theme holding

within itself the same archaic golden
quality i had noted in the singing and
over-he moon flame pinnacles rose higher

  yolara lifted her arms within her hands
were clasped okeefes she raised them
above their two heads and slowly slowly
drew him with her into a circling graceful
step tendrilings delicate as the slow spir-
alings of twilight mist upon some still
stream

  as they swayed the rippling arpeggio-
grew louder and suddenly the slender pin-
nacles of moon fire bent dipped flowed to
the floor crept in a shining ring around
those two-and began to rise a gleaming
glimmering enchanted barrier-rising ever
rising hiding them

  with one swift movement yolara un-
bound her circlet of pale sapphires shook
loose the waves of her silken hair it fell
a rippling wondrous cascade veiling both
her and okeefe to their girdles and now
the shining coils of moon fire had crept to
their knees was circling higher-higher

  and ever despair grew deeper in my
soul

  what was that i started to my feet and
all around me in the blackness i heard
startled motion from without came b
blaring of trumpets the sound of run
ning men loud murmurings the tumult
drew closer i heard cries of lakla
lakla now it was at the very thresholn
and within it oddly as though-punctu
ating-the clamor a deep-toned almost
abyssmal booming sound thunderously
bass and reverberant

  abruptly the harpings ceased the moon
fires shuddered fell and began to sweep
back into the crystal globes yolaras
swaying form grew rigid every atom of it
seeming to be listening with intensity so
great that it was itself like clamor she
threw aside the veiling cloud of hair and
in the gleam of the last retreating spirals
i saw her face glare out like some old
greek mask of tragedy

  the sweet lips that even at their sweet-
est could never lose their delicate cruelty
had no sweetness now they were drawn
into a square-inhuman as that of the
the conquest of the moon pool



medusa in her eyes were the fires of the
pit and her hair seemed to writhe like
the serpent locks of that gorgon whose
mouth she had borrowed all her beauty
was transformed into a nameless thing
hideous inhuman blasting if this was
the true soul of yolara springing to her
face then i thought god help us in very
deed

  i wrested my gaze away to okeefe
all drunkenness gone himself again he
was staring down at that hellish sight and
in his eyes were loathing and horror unut-
terable so they stood-and the light fled

  only for a moment did the darkness
hold with lightning swiftness the black-
ness that was the chambers other wall
vanished through a portal open between
gray screens the silver sparkling light
poured

  and through the portal marched two by
two incredible nightmare figures-frog
men giants taller by nearly a yard than
even tall okeefe their enormous saucer
eyes were irised by wide bands of green-
flicked red in which the phosphorescence
flickered like cold flames their long muz-
zles lips half-open in monstrous grin held
rows of glistening slender lancet sharp
fangs over the glaring eyes arose a horny
helmet a carapace of black and orange
scales studded with foot-long lance-headed
horns

  they lined themselves like soldiers on
each side of the wide table aisle and now
i could see that this horny armor covered
shoulders and backs ran across the chest
in a knobbed cuirass and at wrists and

heels jutted out into curved murderous
spurs the webbed hands and feet ended
in yellow spade-shaped claws a short
kilt of the same pale amber stones that i
had seen upon the apparition of the moon
pool chambers wall hung about their
swollen middles

  they carried spears ten feet at least in
length the heads of which were pointed
cones glistening with that same covering
from whose touch of swift decay i had
so narrowly saved rador

  in all the chamber there was now no
sound yolaras hellish face had changed
no whit nor had okeefes eyes left it

and then quietly through the ranks
of the frog men came-a girl be-
hind her enormous pouch at his throat
swelling in and out menacingly in one paw
a tree-like spike-studded mace a frog-man
huger than any of the others guarding
but of him i caught but a fleeting invol-
untary glance all my gaze was for the girl

  for it was she who had pointed out to
us the way from the peril of the dwell-
ers lair on nan-tanach and as i gazed at
her i marveled that ever could i have
thought the priestesses more beautiful
turning i saw larrys own gaze leave
yolara for her saw him stiffen and to his
eyes rush joy incredible and an utter
abasement of shame

  and from all about came murmurs-
edged with anger half-incredulous tinged
with fear

  lakla

  the handmaiden to the silent ones

the v force

by fred c smale

it upset the rhythm of life wherever it went even to take it somewhere to get
rid of it would be a perilous undertaking from which you might never return

i examined the bar of metal closely
subsequent measurements showed it
to be fourteen inches long three inches
wide and three-quarters of an inch thick
on the broad surface about the center
was engraved a circle with strokes radiating
from it possibly a conventionalized repre-
sentation of the sun beyond this no marks
were visible

  the metal itself so far as i could
judge was a very hard steel with a curious
ruddy iridescence on the surface somewhat
reminding me of the appearance of shot
silk when suspended between the fingers
and thumb and struck sharply it rang with
a clear bell-like note evidently there was
no flaw in the metal

  do you believe it i asked looking
up from my examination

copyrighted  by

    walter surtees shrugged his shoulders
  twenty years residence in the east
  said he have taught me to believe many
  stranger things

    but this i protested a mere bar
 of inanimate metal to have all the powers
 you ascribe-

    excuse me he corrected i dont
 ascribe any powers to it at least you
 havent heard me do so yet i have merely
 retailed to you the statement made to
 me by the thibetan priest who gave it
 to me

    has it the ordinary magnetic proper-
  ties said i but of course you have
  thought of that walter surtees smiled

    yes i have tested it but it doesnt
  even lift iron-filings no it isnt a mere
  bar-magnet whatever it is

the frank a munsey co




the v force



  but that stuff about the periodic
powers  said i if there is anything
in it at all it must be permanent i am
inclined to think the whole thing is a
fable i dare say those artful priests were
able to play some curious tricks with it
its their business

  my friend looked queerly at me for a
moment before he spoke

  well to be frank with you said he
there is something supernormal about it
i havent confined my experiments to pok-
ing it among iron-filings

  what else then i asked curiously

  it shines in the dark for one thing
he replied

  i laughed

  radium i suggested possibly it
contains a minute quantity but that
wasnt what you were going to tell me
you would hardly call looking at it in
the dark an experiment

  surtees rose and went to the door of
the room

  you shall see for yourself saio he

  he opened the door and whistled softly
presently a huge gray cat insinuated it-
self into the room and rubbed itself affec-
tionately against my friends leg purring

  surtees closed the door and returned
to his chair

  now watch said he

  the cat followed him for a yard or
two then it seemed to grow suddenly
uneasy its fur rose and its tail became
enlarged

  in obedience to a sign from surtees i
placed the bar which i was still holding
on the floor the cat watched it as though
fascinated and mewed plaintively it now
seemed more terrified than angry

  slowly as though against its will the
animal drew nearer with a curious sidling
movement until at last it lay close to the
bar motionless and apparently exhausted

  that is certainly queer said i thought-
fully i say i added looking up sharply
youre not playing any parlor magic
tricks old chap

  walter surtees shook his head-gravely
he was watching the cat

  there may be some odor clinging to it
which we cannct ourselves detect i sug-
gested and which the cat can and finds
rather overpowering

  i never knew an odor to affect a cat
or any other animal in that fashion re-
turned surtees this morning it only
fluffed up and swore at the thing now it
seems to be decidedly more impressed
he rose and lifted the cat gently then
he started and examined the animal closely
why its dead he cried

  dead i echoed nonsense

  dead as mutton repeated surtees
luckily it is my own cat and not the
landladys poor brute i was going to
show you something else the canary-
no thanks said i well spare the
canary if you dont mind

  after spending some time in futile ex-
aminations of both bar and poor pussy
we left the bar where i had placed it o
the carpet and passed to some other
my friends curios

  but it was of no use that infernal bar
fascinated both of us at last surtees
muttered something under his breath and
picking it up replaced it carefully in a
leather case

  you take good care of it i remarked
it may resent neglect replied my
friend lightly

  look here old chap said i suddenly
if i were you id take an early train to
brighton or southend and chuck that
thing off the end of a pier--leather case
and all

  i am waiting to see what will happen
he returned in a curious dull tone i in-
tend to see it out

  is there nothing that will check its in-
fluence i suggested no antidote
nothing opaque to it so to speak
i have thought of that i tried lots of
things this morning glass electrified and
normal-silk water shellac a score of
other things i even borrowed an air-pump
from the science school yonder and tried a
vacuum no use any of it

  didnt you learn anything of its nature
from the man who gave it to you


famous fantastic mysteries

  he simply told me that he had taken
it from the robe of a fellow priest whom
he found crushed to death

  crushed to death how

  walter surtees shrugged his shoulders
some sort of panic i believe there
was a big crowd of fanatics at some shrine
or other and this man seemed to have
got underfoot the story was very vague
and he had this thing on him said
i musingly looking at the case on the
table

  surtees nodded

  i rose and as i did so i swayed sud-
denly

  hold up-whats the matter-dizzy
exclaimed surtees

  its that confounded juju of yours
i gasped catching sight of a rather white
face in the mirror i pulled myself together
and reached the door

  ive found a better name for it than
that said walter surtees the v force
the vital force you know

  well leave it at that said i feeling
angry with myself and the mysterious
drawing power which i still felt though
less strongly call it what you like but
i repeat my advice get rid of it or it may
play cat-tricks with you and i touched
the dead animal with my foot

  surtees seemed preoccupied and scarcely
replied to my good night

  i went slowly down the stairs with an
uneasy feeling that i was leaving him to
face some unknown danger alone i hes-
itated and half turned back then i heard
the piano surtees was playing one of his
favorite songs without words i laughed
to myself

  music hath charms i muttered it
may soothe even a steel bar

  yet i could not shake off the memory
of that poor brute of a cat and the mysteri-
ous suddenness with which death had
come to it

two days afterward i was at bexhill
on some business connected with prop-
erty i had there i found it necessary to
stay the night and as i was leaving my

hotel for a stroll and last pipe before
going to bed the boots handed me a tele-
gram it was from surtees forwarded to
me from my town address the message
was brief but sufficiently disturbing it
ran

  come to pelham street at once urgent

                                     surtees

  finding it was impossible for me to
reach pelham street until well after mid-
night i hastily wrote a letter explaining
my sudden change of plan and left it for
the man with whom i had an appointment
in the morning

  at first the matter of the bar did not
occur to me and as surtees was of rather
an impulsive nature i thought his desire
to see me might have its origin in some
legal bother connected with a certain
troublesome brother of his of whom i
knew

  it was a dark foggy night when i ar-
rived at pelham street and the raw mist
seemed to penetrate to my bones there
was a faint glow in the window of surtees
sitting-room-not bright enough to indicate
that he was up and about-but more as
though a bright clear fire had been left
burning in the grate then i remembered
that he used a gas-heater and was mo-
mentarily puzzled

  there seeming nothing to indicate im-
patience or anxiety on his part as i had
run out of tobacco i decided to go on to
the public-house at the corner-it was not
yet midnight-and replenish my stock be-
fore seeing surtees who smoked a brand
too potent for me

   strode on past the house with this
intent when suddenly my legs became
leaden and i felt as though i were battling
against a strong head wind yet the murky
stillness of the atmosphere told me that
such was not the case i strove against
the unseen power which was holding me
back but with each step it grew stronger

  the street was deserted or my quaint
struggles might have roused some doubts as
to my sobriety

  as i paused in bewilderment a ragged
the v force



tramp came shuffling along as he passed
me he gave a curious growl and staggered
against the wall with odd inconsistency
i muttered drunk and obeying an
uncontrollable impulse i stepped back to
the door of surtees lodgings and rang the
bell

  getting no reply i tried the door found
it unlocked and breathing slightly quicker
than usual i mounted the stairs and
knocked at surtees door

  who is there asked a low muffled
voice which i nevertheless recognized as
that of my friend and i answered sharply

  thank heaven said the voice come
in-but take care-take care

  i opened the door and beheld a strange
scene

  surtees lay in a huddled position on the
floor close to his face-within twelve
inches-was the bar it shone with a dull
radiance which filled the room and by
its light  saw that surtees eyes were
fixed upon it and slightly crossed as in
a hypnotic trance

as i stood momentarily in horrified
surprise i became conscious of an
almost overwhelming desire to grovel on
the floor also something seemed to draw
me forward and downward with compelling
force surtees spoke jerkily and as a man
struggling breathlessly with an opponent

  thank heaven-in time-i hope he
gasped while i grasped the door-lintel and
listened

  discovered-antidote he went on
after a moment direct sunlight-even
daylight-weakens-nights - powerful -
stronger each night- my lord

  he broke off with a scream

  it draws life he moaned

  he had never turned his eyes to me
once all this time and he now collapsed
limply by the side of the accursed bar

  look out he whispered

  at first i thought he meant this simply
as a warning to myself then his real
meaning flashed upon me and bracing my-
self up i made determinedly for the win-
dow i reached it in a staggering drunken

fashion and moving the blind aside
peeped down into the street below my
head humming like a beehive the while

  three figures including a policeman
were loitering with apparent aimlessness
directly beneath

  as i looked a stout man came hastening
 along i caught sight of his purple anxious
 face in the light of a lamp when he came
 up he checked his pace abruptly and
 lurched aside the policeman seized him
 and held him up while the other two men
 seemed to look stupidly on

   the sound of the constables gruff voice
 came faintly to my ear now came a horse-
 cart driven rapidly directly beneath the
 horse reared up on his haunches there
 were shouts and a crash the cart had
 turned over

  the street all at once seemed full of
people and a womans scream rang out
shrilly i dropped the blind and turned
aside

  what does this mean i asked and
my voice shook surely this devilish
thing-

  surtees turned his bloodshot eyes on
me with an effort

   i cannot check he whispered hoarsely
 all-london-crushed-death crowd-
 mob-panic 

  what must we do i cried

  big risk-

  i made a gesture of impatience the
movement turned to burlesque by the
force which i felt dragging at every nerve
and muscle what could be worse than
our present position

  well beat it somehow i said

  make-rush said surtees faintly

  i had unconsciously crept to his side
 and we spoke in whispers

  what-how i said vaguely i felt
a leaden dullness coming over me

  walter surtees gave an odd croaking
laugh

   a chase 

  and if we cannot get away

  remember-priest of llassi was his
reply

  come then said i the sooner the


famous fantastic mysteries

better i am the stronger ill take it

  no whispered surtees promptly

  there was not time for argument

  let us carry it together said i your
right hand my left

  he nodded

  glove he muttered

  i understood and drew off the thick
glove from his left hand and placed it on
my own

  now said i

  ready he muttered between clenched
teeth we stretched out our hands to-
gether

  the bar seemed to leap toward us and
there was a sound of impact as it met our
hands as though it were welded to us i
shuddered

  we leaped to our feet a curious sense
of power tingling through our veins the
spell seemed to have been broken

  meanwhile the sounds outside had risen
to a roar and the street was filled by a
seething panic-stricken mob

he back cried surtees

  we dashed from the room holding
the bar between us our strength seemed
irresistible we moved as one individual
and even our unspoken thoughts seemed
in unison

  we burst through the flimsy door lead-
ing to the back premises carrying it clear
off its hinges and i afterward found that
the jagged iron of one of these had caused
a nasty gash in my shoulder

  i felt nothing then

  on we raced through a yard and into
a narrow lane then without a word pass-
ing between us we burst off like some
quaint quadruped for a few minutes we
saw no one then suddenly we found our-
selves in a main thoroughfare-the edge-
ware road i think but am not sure

  it was now nearly one in the morning
and very few people were about but we
were dimly conscious of curious swervings
on the part of those we did pass and pres-
ently we heard the pattering of footsteps
behind us we kept to the center of the
road which at that hour presented few

obstacles we could not have dropped the
bar now even had we desired to do so

  cfur pursuers seemed to be growing in
numbers they were horribly silent there
were no shouts no cries to those ahead
to stop us only that fearsome patter of
many feet behind

  we dived down a side street which took
us into an open space-norfolk crescent
we found it to be afterward it might have
been the top of the monument for all we
knew then apparently our pursuers had
received a check but even as we paused
a second the head of the procession poured
into the crescent

  at the curb stood a car

  quick panted surtees hoarsely
speaking for the first time during our
flight

  we literally flew to the car the
chauffeur was dozing as we came up he
lurched sidewise and fell almost at our
feet we scrambled over him into the car
and while surtees seized the wheel with
his free hand i started the car

  the vision of a wild-eyed man clutch-
ing vainly at the back of the car danced
momentarily across my vision i reached
back to fling him off and the sea of
fierce gibbering faces seemed to glide
smoothly away

  i looked round dazedly we were on a
broad road which appeared to stretch away
into infinity

  surtees sat beside me his jaw set like
iron and his eyes glowing like live coals
under his knit brows

  cannot we drop this infernal thing it
is like being handcuffed said i

  i had no need to raise my voice the car
was almost noiseless

  try said surtees grimly

  but my hand felt paralyzed i realized
that i had no power over it but i was
desperate it seemed ridiculous that i
should not be able to conquer this mere
piece of metal

  lowering the bar of course with sur-
tees hand as well i placed my foot upon
it and we wrenched our bodies back sud-
denly
the v force



 i groaned with pain half the flesh
 seemed torn from my hand but we were
 free and our tyrant lay at the bottom of
 the car

 shall i kick it out said i

 no-no replied surtees the sea
 i understood he meant to give this
 thing effectual burial

 i leaned back and laughed a little i was
 just beginning to realize what we had done
 and were doing

 where are we i asked

 great bath road he answered

 but the sea i exclaimed why not
 the norfolk or sussex coast

 i didnt stop to think it out returned
 surtees dryly

 then we must go on-

 until dawn

 and then-

 relief and freedom said surtees his
 eyes fixed on the road before him

 the houses were thinning now and there
 were no lights fortunately those of the
 car were powerful

 well we are free now said i if it
 comes to that

 try to rise was surtees comment
 only dont fall out

 i seized the side of the car and strove
 to raise myself from the seat it was im-
 possible and i sank back in renewed dis-
 may it was as though we were bound
 down by iron bands

 sunlight the only antidote my
 friends words flashed through my brain
 truly we must go on until the dawn

 is there petrol enough i asked

 i hope so

 where are we going

 devon or cornwall what is the time
 my watch had stopped but just then
 we heard a bell somewhere give a solitary
 stroke

 one said surtees sunrise half past
 six or thereabouts-over five hours

 the effects of our violent exercise were
 passing off and after binding up sur-
 tees wounded hand as well as myjiwn i
  took new heart

  we had met very few motors and we
were going at too great a speed for the
bar to have any effect on those

  when we overtook anything however it
was different this only happened once
between slough and maidenhead on a
long stretch of road we rapidly overhauled
the red light of another car and as we
came within thirty yards or so it suddenly
slackened speed so that we almost dashed
into it

  we swerved aside and dashed by the
other car seemed to leap at us and the oc-
cupants to tumble together of a heap
i set my teeth and held tight but we just
managed to clear them only our great
speed saved them and us from what would
no doubt have been a particularly com-
plicated smash-up

  it must have been a very mystified party
of motorists that we left behind but we
never learned that any one of them was
hurt fortunately throughout the whole
of our journey the experience was not re-
peated

  i need not detail the entire course of
that trying journey we got no chance to
eat

  luckily the car held out and the gray
light of dawn overtook us on the north
coast of cornwall where we drew up at
last somewhere between padstow and new-
quay near the edge of high cliffs directly-
overlooking the sea

  our red-rimmed eyes looked out from
pallid dust-begrimed faces over a slate-
colored expanse of water we were cold
and faint with hunger

  with an effort i managed to drag my-
self from the car but was for some minutes
unable to stand natural stiffness seemed
all we had to contend with now true our
limbs seemed leaden and we lurched
drunkenly against the side of the car but
presently we realized that the dread power
of the bar was almost if not quite vanished

  what would we have not given for a
good stiff drink or even hot coffee-tea-
anything to ease our parched throats and
warm our chilled blood

  presently the ruddy rim of sun shot over


famous fantastic mysteries

the horizon to our right and surtees stag-
gering to the car seized the bar reck-
lessly he held it to the ruddy beams of
the rising monarch which were struggling
through the wintry morning mist

  he gave a crazy chuckling laugh then
his face changed and a furious expression
came over it

  the devil take it he cried and
turning seaward he drew back his arm
and flung the bar with all his strength far
out over the dull-gray waters

  we could not discern the tiny splash
where it fell some twenty or thirty yards
from the shore and in as we afterward
ascertained about twenty-eight fathoms of
water

  we stood gazing dumbly for a moment
then we realized that we were at last
rid of our ghastly incubus and we danced
on the grassy sward like lunatics

  sorry for the fish said i

  whatever the infernal thing can do
said surtees it cant rise from the sea

  we turned to the car and our eyes met
surtees laughed rather grimly

  we are in for trouble said he

  on the contrary we are just rid of
it i returned lightly we have only to
explain-

  i paused and surtees laughed again

  who will believe said he no-we
must clear out the machine is useless to
us now there is no petrol we must leave
it here

  i stood doubtfully and was about to
make some suggestion i know not what
when a glance seaward drove the blood
from my face afresh

  look-look i cried

  at the spot where the bar had sunk was
a huge mound of water like a gigantic
wave the surface of it was white with
foam and though it was as yet in the
shadow of the cliff i thought i could dis-
cern something writhing and leaping there-
from

  walter surtees and i gazed spellbound
a sea-fog was rolling in rapidly growing
denser every moment and before it blotted
the great tossing wave from our view i

fancied i saw a terrible scaly head arise
from the turmoil a hideous monster with
wildly whirling tentacles and ghastly wide-
open eyes

  then the fog hid all we lingered no
longer but turned and ran wildly where
we knew not anywhere away from that
awful nightmare

we escaped all awkward inquiries
more by luck than anything else
we found ourselves possessed of a few
pounds in cash enough to take us safely
to falmouth and thence to jersey and
france where we lay hidden for a while

  the english newspapers were particu-
larly interesting to us the next few days

  we read how the hon stockwood ridge-
ways car had been found deserted on the
cornish cliffs of the mysterious happen-
ings in the neighborhood of pelham street
w and of the no less inexplicable slaugh-
ter of fish near the coast where the car
was found some hundreds of tons being
cast up on the neighboring sands every
tide for some weeks following and curi-
ously enough the riot as it was termed
in pelham street of which after all a
few broken limbs were the worst results
was never connected in any way by the
press with the hiring of the car

  i suppose our exit by the back door and
dash down the lane broke the link which
might have somewhat enlightened the pub-
lic yet what more would they have
learned what do even walter and i
know after all where is the accursed
bar now

  walter surtees suggests that some it-
advised marine animal has swallowed it
and borne it off to spread calamity in
other climes when its periodic power shall
return

  i have sometimes wondered whether this
story may not contain a clue to the
fatal and unaccountable deviations of ships
from their correct courses when near the
cornish coasts

  however here my story ends as far as
i know it

  i	hope it may never have a sequel

famous fantastic mysteries

thanx a million

 i only started last year to read scientifiction
 since then i have learned that it has been going
 on for thirty years or more i found i had missed
 many great yarns your magazine has remedied
 this i cant express how much i enjoyed the
 moon pool and the conquest of the moon
 pool almost immortal and all the others
 all i can say is thanx-a million

answering l a e

in your november issue i see that l a e
suggests using the shortened version of the
metal emperor in your reprint of that story

i beg of you do not shorten any of your
stories print them in full-even if it takes six
months of installments to finish them

i have been waiting for years for some of
those stories to show up again in print and i
thoroughly enjoy reading them all

good luck to you

constructive criticism

congratulations on bringing three of the most
famous fantasy classics together in your no-
vember issue conquest of the moon pool
almost immortal and moon metal any
one of these would make the issue outstanding
but all three-well i just hope you keep it up

and thanks for having virgil finlay illustrate
these yarns they were all splendidly done per-
haps you can also get charles schneeman or
paul who work for the regular science fiction
magazines

most of the other stories radiant enemies
man with the glass heart and fruit of the
forbidden tree were quite good

i would like to enter my protest against the
type of story represented by world in the
balance the formula is so often used

the cover was very distinctive this month

on the contents page in place of the follow-
ing boxed-in statement you now have this
magazine-imaginative fiction why not place
there the titles you plan to publish for the next
issues 

i am glad to see that the blind spot will
be soon started i suppose yoall also republish

 its sequel spot of life incidently a six part
 serial in a monthly is pretty steep i wonder if
 you couldnt combine two installments in one
 issue even at the expense of a novelet in that
 case you can have a three-part novel

likes cover

  the fan magazines prepared me in a way
for the first issue of ffm but needless to
say i was delightfully surprised when i pro-
cured my first copy frankly i was thrilled by
the cover please no pictorial covers they
would be step number one toward mediocrity
of course virgil finlay is your best interior
artist but schneeman and wesso are also ex-
cellent and you can use them to advantage if
you will however i must admit that the lack
of pictures on several stories of your first two
issues doesnt bother me in the least

  now to the stories themselves of course
merritt gets first place in both issues this is
one tale really deserving of the name classic
karpen the jew rated second in the october
number and almost immortal in the no-
vember issue before i forget it let me thank
you for the poem more please

  in closing i say that youve done a grand
job and i hope you can keep up the good work

darkness and dawn demanded

  the second issue of our journey through the
classics was colossal superb and magnificent

  never before have i received so much pleas-
ure from one magazine and i have been reading
fantasy magazines for the last thirteen years
just look at the names of the authors that we
have it looks like a whos who of the almighty
of science fiction

  imagine having merritt starzl england
serviss and austin hall all in one issue boy
but it thrills you to your bones just to see that
it is really true

  you must publish george allan englands
darkness and dawn for two reasons first
because it is the grand daddy of all fantastic
fiction

  i dont know of any other story which sur-
passes it for sheer beauty and originality the
second being and im not only talking for my-
self but for hundreds of readers that this story
has been very difficult to obtain

                                                       -

  i am glad to see you are going to start the
radio man in the next issue but dont forget
you must also print in succession the radio
beasts and the radio planet what a trio
these stories make

  i am glad to see that you have virgil finlay
illustrating for your magazine

  thanks mr editor for the smooth edges
i quite agree with mr tschirky that you
should leave the cover just the way it is dont
change it it does lend a great deal of character
to the appearance of the magazine in fact dont
change anything about the mag as it is now
it is perfect

  publish as many serials as you wish i dont
mind the more the merrier

  in closing ill say from the bottom of my
heart thank you mr editor for answering my
and many thousand others wish for a second
look at the classics

a real friend

  was i surprised truly my love of science
fiction induced me to purchase my copy of
famous fantastic mysteries and to my
delight the contents were excellent but-i
came near to passing it up because of the cover
and the name

  why not put a touch of dignity a radical
idea into our magazine something similar to
harpers in looks i am yet to hear of an
ordinary class of readers our intelligence level
is far above the average this letter is no
criterion but take the general average of fan
mail and compare it to argosy for a literary
average

  i intend to continue reading science fiction
which would have made a fine title you have
the best inside

second issue belter

  the first issue was good but the second
issue of ffm was so much better that the
first was almost a shadow of this one such a
line-up almost immortal which ive been
waiting for ever since times beginning you
cant beat virgil finlays illustrations for such
a story as the conquest of the moon pool
the moon metal is next most welcome i
dont care so much about your reprinting stories
after 

  as for forthcoming stories i would like to
see the rebel soul palos of the dog star
pack the golden blight the planeteer
and king of conserve island

ardent argosy fan

  i have for some time been an ardent devotee
of muosey publications and in particular-be-
cause of its fantastics-argosy of which i have
not missed an issue in more than six years

  morally bolstered by the actual publication
of such a magazine as famous fantastic
mysteries i dare to rise and demand-in ac-
cordance with your request-the appearance of
such stories as the blind spot by homer
eon flint and austin hall the sequel to the
girl in the golden atom the metal mon-
ster  the face in the abyss the radio
beasts the radio planet on the brink of
 the planeteer out of the moon
jason son of jason palos of the dog-star
pack the rebel soul darkness and dawn
triology and into the infinite

  the fervor of a fantasy fan and the glee with
which he contemplates enjoying imaginative
works such as these is i presume unintelligible
to one to whom the spirit is alien but i assure
you the enthusiasm is genuine and deep-rooted
and you have restored my long lost faith in

publish these

  i look forward with keen anticipation to your
forthcoming issues you may be assured of my
own steadfast support as well of the benefit of
whatever influence i can exert among my friends
and fellow science-fiction readers

  as for future stories if it is at all feasible i
should like to have the opportunity to read the
greatly praised-palos of the dog-star pack
mouthpiece of zitu jason son of jason
by j u giesy other stories such as garret
smiths after a million years and h e
flints king of conserve island will assuredly
be welcome
