salesman

       you may laugh at this picture but it should make
       you think in the serious thought behind it is a
       truth so important to you that it may mean the
       turning point in your career sudden brilliant success
       and more money than you ever dreamed of earning

if the suggestion of levity in this illustration is
unusual enough to make you weigh a vicious and
unfounded superstition against plain every-day
fact it will have accomplished its purpose for if
there is one superstition that has victimized thousands
of men-keeping them in miserable low-pay routine
jobs it is that old saw salesmen are born and not
made  the fact is that millions can sell but dont
knoiv it

he found the way

 take thin situation-based on actual facts a man
who has worked all his life in a routine job at low pay
suddenly surprisea hit friends by moving into a better
neighborhood taking a fine home buying a car and
blossoming out as a well-to-do and influential citizen
one month he was a mechanic the next month he wtas
selling goods and making more in a week than he had
formerly made in a month yet he once thought sales-
men were  born that vicious superstition cost him
thousand of dollars a long at he believed it if only one
man had done this you might call it luck but thousands
have tken this easy way to big incomes financial
independence travel congenial work and steady employ-
ment and it all came to them quickly-after they had
found out that master salesmen are made and not
 born

thousands learned the secret

  for example charles beery of wlnterset iowa stepped
from  a week to a position making him  the
very first month j p overstreet deninon texas was
on the capitol police force at a salary of less than 
a year he decided to see how much there was to that
vicious superstition and very shortly after he earned
 in six weeks as a salesman f wynn portland
oregon ex service man never thought ho was cut out
for helling but this association of master salesmen and
sales managers convinced him he could sell taught him
how and in one week he earned  george w
kearns of oklahoma city was making  a month on a
ranch and then earned  in two weeks as a salesman
warren hartle chicago spent ten years in the railway
nj il service then jumped into selling and multiplied
his earnings six times the first year the national
salesmens training association has for fifteen years
been taking men and women from all walks of life in
fact from every known occupation and profession and
makinsr them high-grade salesmen your own logical
deduction will fell you that if salesmen were  bom to
the task then the association-the greatest institution
eflts kind in the worhl--would never have survived its
first yer instead it can proudly point to thousands of

amazing successes and its money back guarantee
bond is an open challenge to those wfho labor under

chapter i

 there are three kinds of women

  jl cross the centerpiece of winter roses
-delicately fashioned fragrant in
a  their setting of soft fern and glitter-
ing crystal-jack kendalls eyes were fixed
upon his sisters face but it was not her
startling beauty that had arrested and now
held his attention he had long ago come
to accept her beauty without thought or
comment she had always been beautiful
as a baby half smothered in lace and fur
she had attracted attention in the park as
a child playing in the sands at newport
 a

or southampton or palm beach she had
won admiration even from the nurses and
governesses and mothers of less fortunately
favored infants and from the moment of
her emergence from the nursery men and
boys had sung her praises unceasingly
suitors had gathered from all four comers
of the earth to bow the knee in breathless
submission famous photographers and por-
trait painters newswriters sculptors had
swelled the ranks of her devotees and add-
ed to her fame so it was not her loveli-
ness that absorbed him now as she leaned
forward across the candle-lighted board
exchanging banter with young howard




argosy-allstory weekly

coleman and garret carpenter between
whom she was seated and yet she had
never looked lovelier for she was swathed
in chiffon of a strange bluish green shade
that made her blue eyes look almost black
and emphasized the sheen of her bobbed
yellow head her shoulders were bare and
gleamed with a pearly luster and though
she seemed somewhat paler than usual her
full three-cornered babys mouth was viv-
idly red jade earrings hung from her ears
and a cut jade ornament of considerable
size hung on a chain about her slender
throat

  the two men bending over her adored
her and it was something in their atti-
tude that had started a train of disturbing
thought in her brothers mind young
coleman of course was not to be seriously
considered he was not yet out of college
but garret carpenter was worthy even of
katherine or so thought her brother at
least he and carpenter had been at yale
together he wished that katherine would
stop playing about-stop flirting with every
new man who took her fancy-stop in her
mad career of dances and dinners and
luncheons and teas-stop drinking and
smoking and rouging her lips

  it was not that she differed at all from
any of the other girls in her set in these
matters in new york in the year nine-
teen hundred and twenty-two these things
were the things to do even the youngest
girls smoked and danced and flirted and
drank the great war had not been fought
to accomplish the complete emancipation
of women - but it had accomplished it
the amazing thing was that the young girls
growing up in this atmosphere of freedom
and unconventionality had been able to re-
tain their underlying sweetness and woman-
liness and jack kendall knew that-for
the most part-they had he knew that
his sister-wild and willful and fast as she
seemed - was still as morally pure - as
clean and fine at heart as his grandmother
had been in her day-and his grandmother
had been a schermerhorn-sheltered from
her cradle by watchful nurses governesses
and chaperons yet-he disapproved of
katherines course-particularly in the
matter of guy da costa

   theyve brought it over from russia
katherine was saying  and its not that it
is so different from our own vaudeville or
revues the same sort of thing has been
done here thousands of times-but not with
quite the same finesse after all it is not
what one does that matters so much it is
how one does it dont you think

   a dangerous philosophy said i larry
carpenter

  but true - true insisted katherine
wetting her lips with the tip of her tongue
 in art-in literature-in society to-day
and in business too the thing is-not what
have you done-but can you get away with
it

   ive heard that before said old mr
coleman from the head of the table u but
i cant quite believe that it is true

   dear old dad smiled muriel coleman
 he doesnt know what the world is like
at all nowadays how can he learn from
his old cronies and at the clubs

   suppose we take him along to the
 king of clubs  and give him an eyeful
suggested howard coleman winking at
jack  theyre opening to-night you
know-and the doors are to be closed at
midnight-and no one is to be permitted
to leave until dawn its going to be some
party 

   i hardly think that sort of thing would
interest father said muriel

   im not so sure it wouldnt smiled
the old man  if i could keep awake that
long id rather like to see how the young
amuse themselves nowadays in my time
we werent in the habit of frequenting cafes
or restaurants - certainly not to dance
there the thing was unknown we had
formal balls at sherrys-private parties of
course-and the young girls went with their
mothers or their chaperons - and their
maids

   the world do move smiled katherine
powdering her nose and observing the ef-
fect critically in the tiny mirror of a gold
vanity case

  the soft-footed maids in black and white
who had been serving withdrew the but-
ler under whose watchful eye all had pro-
ceeded without a hitch now approached
muriels chair to ask quietly
the dance of death



    shall you want the pocket flasks filled
miss muriel

    shall we asked muriel of the others
at large

   better be on the safe side advised
katherine  therell probably be lots of
liquor-but if there isnt-you know how
ghastly parties are and i do want to be
amused to-night i feel-she stopped
mentally searching for the exact word-
 pring-yr she ended triumphantly
 languid and restless and high strung and
tense and hopeful and-a little mad

   you always feel that way my dear
laughed muriel slipping an arm about her
as they all rose and moved toward the door

   at least-you always act that way
added her brother

   katherine shot a swift glance at him ob-
served his somber look and wrinkled up her
face in a mischievous grin

   well-im young-and im alive she
said vibrantly

  in the drawing-room the coffee service
stood ready the butler returned with the
small silver flasks and left them without
comment on the little consul table near the
door

    cocktails cried katherine gayly dis-
tributing them  scotch whisky and gin

i dare say that will do nicely-in an emer-
gency

  she glanced round smilingly noted her
brother still regarding her with troubled
eyes and advanced to him impulsively

    what is it she asked frankly  lets
get it over and done with am i to be
scolded have i done something particu-
larly dreadful and meriting your disapprov-
al tell me-whatever it is-only dont
go on glaring at me this way

   the girls had gone up to get their cloaks
and powder their noses garret carpenter
was keeping the men absorbed in a far cor-
ner of the room jack seized his oppor-
tunity

   the fact is katherine i am worried
about you he admitted frankly  they
are linking your name with this da costa
fellows all over town

   well she asked calmly retouching
her lips with brilliant scarlet rouge

    well he repeated indignantly  does

that please you to have every one say-
ing that you are sentimentally involved
with a common professional dancer-a for-
eigner-a greek

   hes a portuguese she murmured
  well a portuguese then

   hes very fascinating said katherine
 what all the girls call a  tiger  youve
seen him

   frequently admitted jack  hes a
lounge lizard a dissipated young rake-
with womens eyelashes and oilcloth hair
he wears too many rings has scent on his
handkerchief and uses a cigarette holder
that is just half again too long and his
elegance of attire indicates that early in life
he must have suffered great poverty some-
where in the slums

   of course you wouldnt understand
him-or appreciate him reflected kath-
erine her glance running over her brothers
muscular build  youre a mans man
guy is a womans man a lover

  she closed her eyes dreamily and drew
a long breath her brother resisted with
difficulty the impulse to seize her white
shoulders and shake her

   so-you dont deny that you have been
carrying on a flirtation with this fellow
he cried grimly

  deny it no indeed responded
katherine opening wide eyes now im
a fool over guy until youve danced with
him-well youve never danced-thats all
and his voice-when he presses his cheek
against yours and tells you how wonderful
you are its like the low tones of a ha-
waiian guitar theres something tremen-
dous and compelling and electric in his
touch too american men are all very
well jack but they are not lovers and
im young-im alive-im beautiful i
want to enjoy my youth while it lasts i
want to live i want to feel

  he gazed at her with knitted brows half
enraged at her attitude of brazen defiance
-half moved to shame by her frankness

   if you werent my sister he said with
forced calmness  i should classify you as
-quite a different sort of woman than-
you are for what you evidently mean is
that this fellow has a physical appeal for
you


argosy-allstory weekly

   exactly she agreed nodding and
smiling brightly

  he stared he had intended to frighten
and disgust her but very evidently he had
quite failed

   you see she went on frankly u most
girls pretend that they are ethereal beings
far above the physical plane i dont
im a human being-as physical as any-
body else and guy does appeal to that
side of me there are other sides of my
nature that do not approve of guy but
the men who appeal to those sides dont
seem to stir me as guy does the great
thing is to decide what i want most-what
i need most she had forgotten him now
she was debating the problem with
straightened brows and vague eyes and lips
that drooped wistfully at the corners with
something like terror he watched her fas-
cinated he had never realized before
what tremendous depths there were in her
-depths of feeling - depths of thought
suddenly he recognized the futility of try-
ing to influence her she was not only a
beautiful willful girl she was a person-
ality

   there are three kinds of women she
went on gravely if you are a definite
type at all you belong to one of these three
kinds they are the women who are bom
to be mistresses the women who are born
to be wives and helpmates and the women
who are born to be mothers the wives
and helpmates are the ones who find their
greatest happiness in the marriage bonds
the mother women subordinate everything
to the business of bearing and rearing off-
spring the mistresses - are the women
who love and are loved-devotedly-pas-
sionately-and often if i only knew to
which class i belong it would be so easy to
--decide-many things

  he spent his days in wall street his
nights at dances the theaters the opera
he read chiefly the newspapers and the
things she was saying horrified him he
stood gazing at her in speechless dismay

   you mean that you-you regard your
feelings for this fellow seriously he
gasped at last  there is some foundation
of truth in the tales going about-that-
that you are planning to elope with him

   she gazed straight back into his eyes
her own dark with wistfulness and honesty
and wonder

    i am attracted to him-tremendously
whether the attraction will grow stronger
-or pass-i dont know and of course
-whatever i do will depend on that but
if he can make me care enough-if he can
make me care so much that i will give up
everything else for him-without regret-
ill go with him wherever hell take me-
even if i have to pay afterward it is
something to love that way and you have
to pay for everything in this life she
drew a long breath  but all that is in the
future-yet for the present-i am con-
tent just to-drift

   he stood regarding her helplessly with
something like terror in his eyes

   where does he come from who is
he who are his people he asked slowly

   i dont know and what is more i
dont care those things are-after all-
so unessential only this much i am sure
of i will not be frightened out of taking
what i want from life i am going to live
i am going to be happy and i dont give
a damn what anybody else thinks or says
as jack stood motionless gazing fasci-
nated at his sisters serious passionate face
the others gathered all ready for the the-
ater and the night of revelry that was to
follow-and old mr coleman was among
them

  no one had a premonition of what was
about to befall

chapter ii

the king of clubs

nat silvers had been running cafes
in new york from the time that the
dance craze began his first estab-
lishment the parisian gardens had been
located on seventh avenue in a section of
the tenderloin that was not considered
very choice or smart there he had in-
stituted the first cabaret which had con-
sisted chiefly of cheap song-and-dance acts
the performers passing among the tables
and mingling freely-sometimes too freely
-with the guests no fashionable people
the dance

of death



had been frequehters of the parisian gar-
dens no celebrities had been seen there
the commonest sort of fast livers had pa-
tronized the place and laid the foundation
for nat silverss fortune for the band
brought on from the west was the first
 jazz band  imported from the barbary
coast of san francisco it was a band of
negroes wearing funny hats and playing
funny instruments that had a home-made
look but the music had a barbaric rhythm
-a swing-a beat-that was new to jaded
new york in nineteen hundred and seven
and it  caught on  in the district where
new thrills are always welcomed and ac-
claimed racing touts song writers vau-
deville people liquor salesmen of the lower
class stenographers and manicurists travel-
ing men out on a spree chorus girls and
collegs boys who had not much to spend
but wanted to spend it royally all knew
nat silverss place and after midnight
women in picture hats and low cut gowns
women from the various disorderly resorts
arrived unattended and were permitted to
sit about and wait the singers of that day
had specialized in suggestive songs

  but nat silvers had not been content
with the parisian gardens two years
later he opened the  jardin de lys on
broadway and angled for a better clientele
there he offered a kind of revue the
cabaret craze was in full swing the show
at the jardin de lys had roller skaters in
it a sword dancer a really good soprano
a chorus of agile dancing girls and there
was a french head waiter in charge to give
it what nat called  class

   he still owned and ran the parisian gar-
dens but he ran the jardin de lys differ-
ently and when he opened the  college
inn and then the  red mill he gave
each one a slightly better air in nineteen
hundred and twenty he had finally cap-
tured the  top-notchers  with his  domi-
no rouge which became the most expen-
sive and the most exclusive after-theater re-
sort in new york the fifth avenue
crowd preferred it to sherrys or the junior
league dances the food was excellent
the wine was perfect the floor was very
small but beautifully designed for dancing
and the orchestra was the best in town

you had to be well known to  charlie 
or you couldnt get a table at the domino
rouge

  and now nat silvers was opening a new
place-the  king of clubs

  he had taken an old private house and
had remodeled it for this new place be-
cause prohibition had made somewhat dif-
ferent arrangements necessary the domi-
no rouge was too accessible several times
the police and the revenue officers had in-
vaded it

  the king of clubs had an iron-grille
door that locked and an inner door of
solid mahogany and brass a man in liv-
ery presided at each portal and scrutinized
the arriving guests before admitting them
and from the supper room which was on
the second floor there were five exits all
carefully designed and concealed all lead-
ing in different directions all planned for
the safe and convenient dispersal of guests
should any unexpected interruption occur
here the guests could be supplied with the
forbidden intoxicants that they demanded
and were willing to pay for on an incredible
scale prohibition had not destroyed nat
silvers it was making him a millionaire

  into the furnishings of the king of clubs
he had sunk a fortune rare tapestries and
hangings just the right furniture and fix-
tures gave the place an air and charlie
who had so successfully presided over the
domino rouge was in charge of this new
establishment for the opening announce-
ments had been sent only to the domino
rouges most desirable patrons and as
eleven oclock struck on the opening night
they began to arrive expectantly groups
of flappers from the avenue and the east
fifties and sixties and seventies attended
by their college and wall street swains
some of the wealthy demimondaines with
their millionaires from boston and phila-
delphia and new york a very few show
girls swathed in chinchilla and ermine
glittering with diamond chains and square-
cut emeralds celebrities of the motion-pic-
ture world eager to see and to be seen
stage stars the newest gayest richest so-
cial lights and a sprinkling of bachelors
and dancing men the poachers who always
come unattended and  cut in


argosy-allstory weekly

  nat silvers stood just inside the door-
way of the supper room and watched them
his little pigs eyes shining with greed and
gloating but he was apparently an onlook-
er for charlie was in charge-charlie with
the grand manner who knew each worth-
while customer by name knew just what
degree of respectful deference or friendli-
ness to assume in greeting knew just which
table would be most desired and appre-
ciated he was inimitable this charlie
no doubt about that but once nat sil-
vers departed from his established principle
and interfered when charlie was about to
turn away a guest it was a middle-aged
man in an old-fashioned evening suit - a
shrewd looking grim old fellow with gray
hair that was too long a diamond on his
finger that was too large and velvet on the
collar of his long-tailed coat he was un-
known to charlie and uninvited and
charlie was turning him away with polite
regret and a few hurried words about  no
tables when silvers caught sight of him
and advanced with outstretched hand

    harry bartlett he exclaimed warmly
in greeting

  bartlett seized the hand and wrung it
charlie nodded wearily for the boy at the
door to lift the crimson rope and admit the
gentleman and signed to his assistant to
conduct him to table forty-seven - back
among the palms and near the orchestra
he had been reserving the table for a pair
of lovers who preferred seclusion and a
spot from which they could see without be-
ing seen he yielded it up to bartlett
hoping that the old-fashioned fellow would
be comparatively inconspicuous there for
charlie was an artist in his line and he
wanted his opening crowd to be an impres-
sive one

  accordingly bartlett and silvers fol-
lowed the assistant captain to the screened
table indicated and there sat down oppo-
site each other with the interested regard
of men who have not met for years

   it must be fifteen years since ive seen
you-or longer silvers was saying with a
smile  it was before i left the coast i
know

   yes agreed bartlett slowly  well
youve prospered i see started in the new

game in time i met johnny whalen to-
night and he told me about you and the
new place you were opening here thats
how i came to show up i havent done so
well myself the racing game is done-
finished-and i didnt know when to quit
the reformers have about ruined this coun-
try for my kind prohibition blue laws
income tax we used to have a conti-
nental tone freedom now-were like a
middle-aged lady going back to pigtails and
pinafores guess i havent kept abreast
of the times-thats it i havent done so
well

   nothing put by asked silvers  you
must have cleaned up several fortunes in
your day harry

   yes-but you know how it goes
come easy-go easy i had my share of
bad luck too and i got trimmed some-
here and there oh ive got enough to go
along with ive given up the idea of get-
ting into the millionaire class im a kind
of onlooker now it interests me the way
things have changed

  he studied the ash on his cigar with
frowning eyes then glanced up and off
across the crowded rooms

   the crowds dont even look the same
he said  do you remember rectors-in
the golden days the old martins-the
grand union at saratoga look at those
girls for instance what are they any-
way where do they belong they dont
look old enough to be out nights - but
theyre gotten up to look like hussies-and
they act like them too

  his glance followed katherine kendall
dancing with garry carpenter

   the face of an angel he said  but
-look at her 

  she was locked close in her partners
arms her cheek against his as they moved
in perfect rhythm

    thats the kendall girl said silvers
 millions they all come to my places-
especially since ive got da costa

   da costa repeated bartlett curi-
ously

   the dancer hes the rage just now
dances here every night at twelve thirty
i had him at the domino rouge before
you havent heard of him
the dance of death



  not

   well the women in this town have
gone crazy over him god knows why
hes a good-looking fellow but no better
than a hundred others that anybody could
name only hes got a way with them-a
way of charming them i dont know what
it is its not only that he dances like a
streak there are lots of good dancers-
but he certainly draws the crowds  pay
him fifteen hundred a week and a percent-
age

   thats real money mused bartlett

  yes but hes worth it wait till you
see him

  silvers consulted his watch and rising
beckoned the assistant captain

   mr bartlett is my guest give him
anything he wants the house is his he
said and nodding at bartlett moved off

  bartlett turned to the dance floor again
the confusion of laughter and talk the
rattle of cutlery the clink of glassware and
dishes--the myriad sounds of the revelers
drinking and supping-had died down as
though at some signal previously given
the lights were lowered and a strong white
spotlight was focused on the end of the
room there was an excited hush in the
orchestra there was a great roll of drums-
then-dramatically two figures appeared in
the illumination one was a slender red-
haired girl in black glittering with dia-
monds-on her throat-in her ear-on her
fingers-in her hair the other was a man
in the black and white of formal evening
wear

  it was da costa

  but bartlett peering through the screen
of palms recognized him at a glance as
tony costello one-time valet and pick-
pocket ex-jailbird a man whom he of all
men had good cause to remember

chapter iii

magnetic sleek and immaculate

hk sat transfixed staring as da costa
and the red-haired girl advanced
bowing in recognition of the tumul-
tuous applause

  then they began to dance

  it was precisely as silvers had said
there was nothing unusual or miraculous
about their dancing the girl was unde-
niably pretty and graceful da costa had
lost none of his grace or charm he moved
with agility and ease he smiled his white
teeth flashing against his dark skin his
beautiful dark eyes were fixed on the girls
face passionately but he was sleek im-
maculate-and he radiated still-as he had
always radiated-a terrific physical magne-
tism - an animal magnetism that played
about him like lightning setting him apart
singling him out holding the eyes of all
beholders

  bartlett felt it understood it as he had
felt and understood it years before and
his glance wandered from the dancers to
the breathless crowds at the tables they
were like birds hypnotized by a serpent
the women and girls especially gazed
upon da costa with brilliant eyes wetting
their lips or biting them holding their
breath-all perhaps save katherine ken-
dayv who sat as though a little bored and
weary though there was something in her
very guarded aloofness that was significant

  the music - barbaric - insidious-ele-
mental in its appeal-with a beating throb-
bing undertone that had something savage
in it emphasized the sensuous swaying of
the dancers and affected the audience pow-
erfully they followed every move and
posture hung upon the hard brilliant glit-
ter of the womans diamonds the gleam of
her white body through the enshrouding
black gauze the flaming hair the sleek
panther-like litheness of the man the
pair held them in a kind of spell but not
bartlett

  there grew in him as he watched a
sudden violent hatred of this puppet of his
own-this frankenstein that he had cre-
ated for lie had freed tony costello from
a second impending jail sentence had edu-
cated and groomed and clothed him to be a
tool of his own in san francisco eight years
before he had made of him this finished
instrument of destruction and had shared
his spoils equally for the three years that
he had directed his career

  then the war had called costello and he
had marched away-never to come back


argosy-allstory weekly

for five years bartlett had believed him
dead he had looked upon him as an invest-
ment that had not panned out now he
realized that costello had simply wearied
of paying dividends-had preferred new
york to the western coast-had widened
his field of operation-and had eliminated
his master by the simple expedient of
changing his name

  bartlett was a gambler and a game
sport he had held no bitterness in his
heart for tony costello whom he believed
to have died in france but against this
cheat this welcher guy da costa his fury
grew

  he had picked him up out of the gutter
sensing his insidious charm had paid for
his clothes his food his education had
himself engaged dancing masters and pro-
cured the boys first cafe engagement for
all this he had taken half of the boys
earnings of course-and half of all that he
made on the side from the foolish women
who flocked about him and their more
foolish husbands and fathers and sons
but that had been the arrangement agreed
upon between them on the night that cos-
tello was arrested for pocket picking on the
barbary coast and bartlett had gone bail
for him and paid counsel for his defense

  he felt now that there was a lot of
money coming to him

  half of all that guy da costa had earned
in the intervening years with the means
that bartlett had supplied but for bart-
lett he would still be a petty thief in san
francisco that was what bartlett
thought as the dancers swayed and the
audience sat breathless and the barbaric
music throbbed and beat

   he stood up trembling the better to ap-
praise his handiwork and judgment and
his face-topping the palms now came by
chance into the white light cast by the cal-
cium lamps and as he gazed at da costa
suddenly in turning da costa saw him

  he faltered he almost stopped his
feet-so clever-so well trained-missed a
beat to see bartletts face like that so
grim so hard so accusing-was like seeing
a ghost it startled him out of all com-
posure

    what is it panted the red-haired girl

under her breath she had never known
him to miss a step before

  its nothing go on he whispered

  he did not glance toward bartlett again
but the smile was no longer on his lips-
that famous smile that so intrigued the
women and in his dark eyes was an ex-
pression of doubt of uncertainty almost
fear

  the dance ended-amid tumultuous ap-
plause they bowed retreating they
bowed again and again the orchestra
picked up the encore

  but something intangible had gone out
of da costas work he did not move with
his usual abandon his usual careless lis-
someness and he did not smile he was
uneasy although bartlett was no longer
visible among the palms da costa felt the
menace of his presence there he finished
the encore and made his way toward the
stairway in the rear the wide stairway that
led to the lounge and retiring rooms on the
floor above but before he mounted the
steps he sent a waiter to katherine with a
note hastily scribbled on one of his cards
he wrote

get away on some pretext and meet me in

   the lounge upstairs important

                                          gtjt

  then he hurried up the stairs and en-
tered the lounge

  it was a little french drawing-room
beautifully done and-it was empty he
made sure of that then he passed into
the little turkish smoking room beyond it
and made sure that that was empty too
returning to the little french drawing-
room he waited there watching the door
since there was no other way to enter either
room save by that door-the turkish room
was just a sort of alcove with no doorway
of its own-he felt sure that he could say
what he wanted to say to katherine with-
out any danger of eavesdroppers-and this
was most essential

  if he had been permitted to follow the
course he had carefully mapped out for
himself he would not have asked katherine
to marry him for another month at the least
he was by no means sure of his hold upon
her emotions yet but the untimely arrival
the dance of death	

of bartlett was forcing his hand for bart-
lett knew too much about him bartlett
could-if he so desired-reveal to kather-
ine or her family enough about his past to
destroy what feeling the girl had for him
and she was his great opportunity mar-
riage with her meant not only fortune-it
meant security too and a future he was
playing for big stakes-the biggest stakes
he had ever played for-and time pressed

  just what bartlett meant to do da costa
had no idea but that bartlett would take
some means of avenging the trick that had
been played upon him da costa felt cer-
tain he knew bartlett

  he regretted now that he had not played
fair but it had seemed so simple to elimi-
nate bartlett by changing his name and so
to keep all his earnings for himself and
he had believed bartlett permanently es-
tablished in the west he had so often
heard the older man declare that the golden
opportunities lay there-that there was
nothing in the east for him or his kind
and now-here he was-most inopportune-
ly-turning up to jeopardize da costas
hard-fought campaign

  pacing the floor nervously he waited
watching the door listening for the sound
of katherines coming

  there was a step on the stair he
mopped his perspiring brow and forced a
smile

  but the smile faded as he saw that it
was bartlett who appeared in the doorway

  he had noted da costas retreat from
the supper room and had followed him un-
ostentatiously now he quietly closed the
door behind him and advanced his eyes
fixed grimly upon da costas whitening
face

   hello tony he said pleasantly-too
pleasantly in his voice was the ring of
steel

   da costa wet his lips his first impulse
was to deny his identity-to pretend to be
somebody else then the futility of such
a move came home to him he stood silent

   you havent forgotten me have you
said bartlett  harry bartlett - from
frisco dont you remember the night i
went bail for you when you were up on that
larceny charge-and i got my lawyer to

defend you and that little affair with
the cronin girl at vernon-

   sure  remember you of course i
remember you said da costa hurriedly
 but we cant talk here-

  yes we can talk here all right said
bartlett interrupting  and were going to
talk here

  da costa was trembling

 impossible he protested too
many about this is a public room any
one may come in-at any moment-

  he was thinking of katherine-blessing
whatever it was or whoever it was that was
detaining her

  come to my rooms-to-morrow he
urged

   oh no smiled bartlett shaking his
head  you gave me the slip once im
taking no chances with you a second time
you little skunk thought youd shake
me did you thought you didnt need me
any more-so youd chuck me you
welcher 

  his self-control was slipping now he
was working himself into a passion of rage
and his voice was raised but the jazz band
dowtistairs was beating out another weird
barbaric dance tune-and nobody heard

   shut up i tell you we can settle all
this later cried da costa in fear

   well settle it now roared bartlett
hoarsely  and well settle dollar for dol-
lar you hear why youd be in the gut-
ter yet if i hadnt picked you out and
cleaned you up and taught you how to play
this game youre very fine to-night mr
guy da costa your nails are manicured
and your trousers are nicely creased and
your manners are very high and mighty
but everything youve got i got for you-
hear that i got you those pearl studs
 got you that ring-all of it-everything
-its all mine and youre going to come
across-and come clean 

  da costas eyes were glittering now
his fear of discovery and disgrace - the
agonizing possibility that this old man might
wreck his plans-ruin his carefully planned
campaign for future greatness-and secu-
rity-set blazing in him suddenly the fires
of battle he was at bay-and true to his
type when he was cornered he would fight

   youre going to shut up he cried
through clenched teeth  or im going to
have you thrown out of here - into the
street 

  bartlett caught his breath he saw red

   youre going to have me thrown out
he repeated  you jailbirdi he cried

  da costa leaped at his throat-reverting
to earlier tactics-to the tricks of the street
gamin he had been when bartlett had first
picked him up he had lost all caution
now his one impulse was to still that
taunting voice that threatened to jeopardize
his future there was murder in his heart
-murder in the fingers that closed upon
the older mans throat but bartlett had
matched his wits against the law too many
times to succumb now without a struggle
in fact he was-as always-prepared

  on his way up he had passed a serving
table and his eye had fallen upon a small
sharp steak knife that lay on it-a little
french carving knife-a dangerous weapon
unarmed he had recognized the wisdom of
preparing against just such an attack as
this he reached for the knife which he
had hidden in his waistcoat pocket

  sensing the meaning of his move da
costa released his grip upon bartletts
throat and seized the hand that already
gripped the weapon they struggled da
costa with the fear of death egging him on
bartlett obsessed with the fury to punish
and avenge

  the knife drawn from his waistcoat
pocket by bartlett was forced back by da
costa until the sharp point of it pierced
the older mans side and was driven in
slowly painfully but he was a spartan
and he made no outcry-only exerted every
ounce of strength there was in him-and
steeling his muscles forced back da costas
hand

  slowly the knife came out bartlett
forced it away from himself and toward da
costa turning the blade as it came dread
and horror crept into the dancers eyes
he felt the intensity of purpose back of the
knife though he did not know of the pain
that bartlett was suffering or the warm
blood that he felt trickling out against his
shirt closer and closer came the point
toward da costas throat

  now the anger in him was passing to be
replaced by craven fear the point of the
blade scratched against his collar he grew
cold sweat stood out on his brow he ex-
erted all his energy to force back the hand
that clutched it so firmly-but to no avail
he felt the steel upon his throat-threw
back his head and uttered a cry of horror
but a gasp-a gurgle cut short the cry as
the blade went home

  the grip upon bartletts arm tightened
spasmodically and loosed guy da costa
lurched forward a trembling shaking heap
-and lay still the knife still plunged to
the hilt in his neck

  and as bartlett stood looking down at
what he had done with one hand pressing
his own wounded side the throbbing beat-
ing uncivilized music of the band down-
stairs-a fitting accompaniment to such a
deed-suddenly ended with a weird jarring
discord-and bartlett heard katherines
knock upon the door

chapter iv

the scream of a woman

the arrival of guy da costas card at
the colemans table had aroused
jack kendalls ire and stirred his an-
tagonism afresh but the message written
on it had appealed strongly to katherines
thirst for adventure and romance

get away on some pretext and meet me in

  the lounge upstairs important

                                 guy

  those words written in a hurried scrawl
piqued her curiosity-spurred her imagina-
tion with eyes so much keener because
of her interest in him she had observed da
costas strange behavior during his dance
and she had wondered it was clear now
that something had happened was he ill
perhaps

  her brother s eyes fixed on her aroused
her from her abstraction she tucked the
card into the front of her gown and looked
up to find the others at the table all watch-
ing her questioningly

  she smiled and dismissed the waiter with
a nod-turned to garret carpenter with
perfect poise and assurance and cried
the dance of death



   come on garry the  song of in-
dia  we can t miss this

  and an instant later she was dancing with
him as though the message on the card
had been a jest of some sort-and of no im-
portance at all but jack kendall was not
deceived nor was garry carpenter both
men had seen the almost imperceptible rais-
ing of her eyebrows as she had read the
message-the fixed stare with which she
had regarded it both men were alert-
and rather anxious

  meanwhile katherine danced with eyes
half closed her cheek against garrys her
mind racing

  she hoped that he was not ill - that
nothing had happened which might pre-
cipitate a crisis in their pleasant relation-
ship for as she had truthfully told her
brother she was not at all sure yet what
she wanted to do about guy she under-
stood the nature of his appeal to her per-
fectly-but she was not sure enough of her-
self yet to know just how much that sort
of appeal meant to her and young as she
was she was clever enough to realize that
her whole future was at stake in the affair
-and that she must make no mistake

  he thrilled her-he made love to her di-
vinely with every glance wkh every word
with every accidental contact for he had
the suavity and finesse about such things
the absolute freedom from self-conscious-
ness that most latins have-and no amer-
icans he never felt as a silly ass saying flat-
tering things to her he never minded the
whole worlds knowing that he adored her
she liked that but there was much in
him that she did not quite like-that she
did not quite understand - but that she
vaguely distrusted

  for one thing she did not absolutely be-
lieve him there was something about his
eyes-wide and dark and melting as they
were-something disturbing he had not
the frankness the straight-from-the-shoul-
der honesty the substantial reliability of
garry carpenter he seemed at times too
tactful too diplomatic and he lacked
carpenters cool head his reasonableness
he was not remarkably intelligent but he
was charming he amused her and stirred
her to strange new depths of feeling

  however it was one thing to dance and
flirt and play about with him and another
thing altogether to give her whole future
into his keeping

   the song of india  went on-not ex-
actly as rimski-korsekov wrote it but as
the leader of the jazz band had arranged it
for dancing and garry carpenter held
her close trembling at the precious contact
but inarticulate she knew this-as all
girls know-understood perfectly that she
could have him for the mere nod of her
head and she smiled up at him wishing
that he could stir in her the depths that
da costa stirred for she already admired
him-liked him-respected him more than
she could ever admire or like or respect da
costa

  the dance ended but most of the dan-
cers held theit places applauding smiling
toward the band waiting for the encore
that was never denied them this was her
opportunity she had been reluctant to
hurry to the lounge upon receipt of guys
note partly through an unwillingness to
annoy her brother partly through a disin-
clination to flatter guy but now she laid
her hand on garrys arm and murmured
softly

   i think ill run up and powder my
nose if youll come with me as far as the
stairs something seems to tell me i need
to get organized

   right-ol said garry

  the dance began again but they moved
through the slowly progressing couples
without much difficulty and gained the
stairway it was beyond the entrance to
the supper room so they were screened
from observation here and as she turned to
mount the steps garry detained her

-	 oh kit he said as if he had sudden-
ly thought of something and she turned
hesitating  were good friends arent
we he brought out then slowly and with
some difficulty

  she stared-arrested by his manner dis-
cerning the seriousness underneath

   why-of course she cried sincerely
you know that

   weve always been he admitted
 and i hope well go on being-no matter
what happens-ever-to-to either of us


argosy-allstory weekly

but what i particularly wanted to say was
-i wish you would promise me that-if
ever you have to make an important deci-
sion-you know-i mean one that really
concerns you deeply-youll tell me about
it first-and talk it over

  he was flushed now and embarrassed
why-garry she cried astonished
 i know its a lot to ask-and that ive
no right to ask it-even as a friend he
went on  but i do wish youd promise
its just-that i dont want you to-make
any mistakes there are some things about
life perhaps that you dont know-and
maybe i do and maybe i could help you
a little youre so young-and so much
flattered and its so easy to make a mess
of things

  she was frowrning a little now-not en-
tirely pleased

   dont misunderstand me he begged
miserably  im not criticizing you-or
trying to intrude myself into your affairs
i dont know how to say it im not much
at this sort of thing but-if i could only
safeguard you a little-you are so impul-
sive-so big-hearted and sympathetic if
i could just be sure that you wouldnt do
anything - anything really important-
without a lot of careful thinking-

  he stopped for she had laid her hand
on his arm again with the simplicity and
naturalness of a child and she was smiling

   dear garry she cried softly  i can
promise you that

  and then she ran lightly upstairs hum-
ming to herself she passed into the dress-
ing room powdered her nose shook out her
bobbed hair and patted it into shape with
deft fingers rouged her lips then she
knocked softly at the door of the lounge
which w as closed

  the music had stopped again down-
stairs she waited knocked again - and
still obtaining no answer tried the knob
the door opened and she went in

  garry meanwhile waited at the foot of
the stairs to escort her back to her table
he lighted a cigarette and lounged against
the newel post idly watching the crowded
supper room through the curtained door-
way for one-two-perhaps three min-
utes he stood there waiting then - he

heard a scream - terrified - startled-an-
guished-a womans scream-katherines
and he mounted the stairs two at a time
the door to the lounge was now open he
dashed in-looked wildly around-and saw
guy s body on the floor behind the door
the maid from the ladies dressing room
and the boy from the mens room crowded
in behind him drawn by the scream

  katherine was not there

chapter v

the doors abe locked

a glance assured garry that the
man on the floor was dead but his
concern was not for him but for
katherine leaving the maid and the
cloak-room boy to bend over the body and
search for signs of life he hurried on into
the turkish room beyond

  xo one here either-and yet-no other
means of egress she could not have left
the room after he heard the scream with-
out his meeting her on the stairs she must
be here-somewhere but where

  katherine he called katherine

  at the sound of his voice the drapery
along the wall stirred and without a sound
the girl fell out from behind them in a help-
less little heap upon the floor she had
fainted

  picking her up in his arms he carried
her out into the french drawing-room
where the maid and the boy still lingered
in horrible fascination

   get her some water-smelling salts-
anything to restore her he cried placing
her in the womans arms and turning to the
boy added  you get mr silvers-quick
and mind you say nothing about this to
any one not to any one

  they submitted to his self-constituted
authority and obeyed gam- hurried down
to the supper room and summoned charlie

   guy da costa has been murdered up-
stairs he said turning his face from the
crowded room so that there would not even
be a chance to read his lips  ive sent
for mr silvers dont tell any one else
just yet-but keep things going here-and
dont let any one leave
the dance of death



  amazed incredulous shaken with the
shock of it charlie nodded dumbly-and
garry mounted the stairs again

  but in the interim bartlett had regained
his table

  when the music had stopped and he had
looked up from the dead man at his feet to
hear katherines knock on the door he had
known one agonizing instant of panic and
had had to clench his fists and set his jaw
against the wild impulse to run amuck-to
run yelling down into that laughing danc-
ing careless throng and shout aloud what
he had done

  the madness passed

  glancing swiftly about the little french
drawing-room he had seen at a glance that
there was no hiding place there-the hang-
ings at the windows were short the fur-
nishings stood out against the white wood-
work and pale yellow walls there was no
closet no other door save into the turkish
smoking room he retreated through that
-and just in time for katherine after
knocking a second time was opening the
door

  the turkish room had no other exit
through which he could escape but the
walls were draped to give the room the ap-
pearance of a tent he secreted himself
behind the draperies-listening

  from this hiding place he had overheard
the rest of the little drama enacted-kath-
erines scream-her retreat to the turkish
room-her attempt to conceal herself be-
hind the draperies too

  he had held his breath then-had stood
there with his hand pressed hard upon the
wound in his side his wide eyes fixed-
every nerve alert only the girls collapse
had saved him from discovery then for if
garry had searched he must surely have
found bartlett first as bartlett was nearer
to him

  but katherine had fainted falling out
into view as she gave way and bartlett had
heard the maid and the boy sent on their
errands had heard garry too run down
the stairs

  seizing his opportunity he had come out
from his hiding place past the dead man
stealthily down the stairs and back to his
table unobserved

  triumphantly now he relaxed examin-
ing with cautious fingers the knife wound
in his side it pained a good deal and it
bled he could feel the blood oozing slow-
ly out-could feel it soaking his heavy un-
dergarment and shirt but it was under his
arm and it did not show only the waist-
coat had ripped under the knife blade not
his coat if he could get out now without
arousing suspicion he could get away-
free no one would ever know

  the first thing was to establish an alibi
he summoned a waiter

   cant i get some service here he
cried indignantly  ive been trying to
get some attention for twenty minutes

   yes sir said the waiter  im sorry
sir i didnt see you what would you
like

   some champagne said bartlett care-
lessly  and my check

   check said the waiter in some sur-
prise  but you cant leave now sir the
doors are locked

   locked repeated bartlett his voice
was not quite steady he tried to muster a
look of surprise  why are the doors
locked wthat has happened

  he felt-as soon as he had said it-that
that was not at all the thing to say-but it
was too late to withdraw it he could only
smile as though he had been half in jest

   nothing has happened sir answered
the waiter  it is just mr da costas idea
for the opening night-to make the party
last no one is allowed to go home until
daybreak

   mr da costas idea repeated bart-
lett slowly

   yes sir said the waiter and moved
away

  bartlett drew a long breath da costas
idea there was something arresting in
that-something alarming-something like
fate without guessing what was to hap-
pen to him that night da costa had
planned to have the doors locked upon the
guests and not opened until dawn - and
now those locked doors stood between his
murderer and freedom perhaps those
locked doors would serve to avenge da
costa it was simply a question of time
could bartlett stanch that gentle flow of


argosy-allstory weekly

blood before the stain spread far enough
to be seen and betray him it was hidden
securely now beneath his waistcoat and
his coat but daybreak was hours off

  he looked at his watch ten minutes
past one that meant five hours - six
hours perhaps to wait six hours to sit
there waiting waiting for the news to
spread-for the frenzy of excitement to be-
gin-for the coming of the police and the
investigation six hours - in which that
wound in his side might bleed-and the
blood stain spread slowly soaking through
the waistcoat and the coat until it appeared
ominously dark and wet-for all the world
to see-until it crept gradually above the
line of his waistcoat standing out redly in
plain view against the soft plaited bosom of
his white shirt

  six hours

  he relaxed in his chair with a look of
weariness on his graying face any other
man in the world would have been beaten
down under the thought of such a hideous
strain but bartlett was game-and a fight-
er he had played against odds all his life
-and time and again he had won and he
told himself now grimly he was not going
to begin to be a quitter-not at his age
let it be a fight between that dead man up-
stairs and himself he had killed da costa
-and da costa had locked the doors
well bartlett would stand pat and let the
dead man make the next move in the game
if he must wait quietly there watching
those jazz mad drink mad young fools ca-
pering and laughing he would wait he
folded his napkin and thrust it underneath
his coat against the wound he could not
get it closer to the flow of blood even there
among the palms where charlie had hidden
him somebody might see him opening his
waistcoat and shirt but it might absorb
some of the damned blood and so postpone
its crimson accusation 

  the waiter brought his champagne and
filled his glass-and he drank it off and
followed it with another it might sustain
him he thought then came the thought
that it would quicken his heart action and
increase the flow of blood he began to
sip it then at intervals calculating them
with care it gave him something to think

about beside his game with the dead man
upstairs

  the band began to play u the song of
india  again-by request

  upstairs in the dressing room katherine
opened her eyes and stared about her
gradually recollection came she called
for garry-wildly-like a frightened child
-remembering that he had been calling
her name as she fell

   garry she wailed piteously

  he came as far as the door and she went
to meet him he took her in his arms
simply and held her close comforting her
she buried her bobbed yellow head on his
shoulder sobbing a little

   you saw him you know she said

   yes he said soothingly

   that dreadful knife oh who could
have done it who she asked tearfully
 such a dreadful thing

   i dont know-but well find out he
assured her  he was-dead when you
found him

   yes-i think so she answered  he
must have been the knife was-deep in
his throat - and - he didnt move when
i cried out

   and you-saw nobody else there
asked garry

   nobody 

   i saw the young lady go in said the
maid from the dressing room she had
been listening and she spoke up now
proud to have something more to add
 nobody came out after not till you
went in i didnt see nobody else

  they looked at her-and then silvers
came hurrying up the stairs charlie had
already told him the news

   where is he he asked

   in there answered garry

   come in said silvers

  garry hesitated looking at katherine

   could you-bear it he asked gently

   yes-yes she answered

  they followed him into the little french
drawing-room and closed the door silvers
was bending over the body to assure him-
self that what he had heard was true
katherine crossed to the other side of the
room carefully not looking
the dance of death



   dead said silvers with a tone of
finality

   yes said garry  he was dead
when i found him

   you found him asked silvers curi-
ously

   yes and sent for you

  we must notify the police said the
little man still staring fascinated at the
hideous sight and then he added in a
voice with a groan in it  this will ruin
me 

  garry found a cigarette and lighted it
his glance wandered to katherine who was
sitting now leaning back in a dainty bro-
caded chair with her eyes closed he
looked at silvers again

   yes he said  if you call in the po-
lice it will ruin you

   ij i call in the police cried silvers
 fve got to call in the police what else
can i do you cant hush a thing like this
up hes got to be buried aint he and
the murderers got to be found

  he squinted at garry thoughtfully-then
glanced at the girl

   i better not waste any more time he
said

   wait cried garry swiftly  you
might save a lot of publicity and scandal
if you solve the mystery yourself before
you call in the police

   if i solve it repeated silvers  ive
got a siveu chance of solving it im no
detective

   neither am i admitted garry  but
i dare say weve got as much brains as
most detectives and as much ingenuity
besides to make it simpler we know that
the murderer is right here in this house
the doors are locked nobody could have
gotten out its just a question of discov-
ering which one of us did it

   which one of us gasped silvers
  which person in the house

   yes but how are we going to discover
that asked silvers

   it ought not to be so difficult said
garry slowly  whoever did it knew da
costa and had a motive we know that
much to begin with and it ought to be
fairly easy to sort out all the persons pres-
ent to-night who might possibly be guilty

  silvers reflected

  if we could pull it and get away with
it it would be a lot better for me he ad-
mitted  but if we dont bring it off-
therell be hell to pay

   its worth the risk said garry
 isnt it

  he eyed silvers steadily and silvers be-
 gan to remember garrys wealth his posi-
 tion his importance here was a man he
 knew whose influence was worth having
 he might need it on the other hand
 there was the chance that garry might
 simply be using him for his own purpose
 and might leave him in the lurch after-
 ward

   youre-intending to help find the
murderer he asked

  yes

   and-youre not-shielding any one
katherine raised her head and looked at
them both men were looking at her

   no said garry

  silvers nodded slowly

   how did you come to find the body
he asked

  garry hesitated

   i screamed katherine put in quietly
  and he came up to me

   wed been dancing you see explained
 garry  and i was waiting for her at the
 foot of the steps

   but she couldnt have seen him on her
way to the dressing room objected silvers
noting the position of the body

   no said katherine quietly  he
had sent me this note-to my table i
came up to see what he wanted

  she drew the card from her bosom and
handed it to silvers he glanced at it with
narrowing eyes

   you see-he anticipated trouble said
garry  or at least-he was upset about
something something had happened
silvers scrutinized the girls face his
small pig eyes seemed to cut into her

   you are quite sure he was dead when
you reached him he asked

   he seemed to be he didnt move
when i screamed she responded

  silvers still searched her face the blood
 mounted to garrys forehead

   exactly what do you mean he cried


argosy-allstory weekly

   nothing answered silvers hastily
 nothing

  he approached the body again and
gazed down at it-bent nearer-staring

    one of my french carving knives  he
exclaimed recognizing the weapon still
thrust into da costas throat  one of
my own knives 

   garry looked about the room swiftly

    his assailant came armed for murder
then he said  such a knife would not
have been in this room

   no agreed silvers  not even on
this floor

    it was murder with intent then said
garry  brutal-premeditated - planned
some one followed him here from the sup-
per room armed to slay him but who

   yes-who repeated silvers awkward-
ly looking down

   that is what we must find out de-
clared garry  between now and dawn
six hours for our investigation-six hours
for uninterrupted research - while the
guilty person is still under this roof it
ought to be easy we have only to use our
brains 

   well said silvers drawing a long
breath  ill be ruined in this town any-
way if this case gets a lot of notoriety
well wait until daylight before notifying
the police ill risk it how shall we
begin

chapter vi

 let the dance go on

garry threw back his head and

 squared his shoulders he felt that

he had won the first trick in the haz-
ardous game that he was playing for kath-
erines safety for the instant he had
first looked upon guy da costa dead he
had realized how seriously the girl might
be involved to avoid the scandal for her
sake to find the murderer swiftly and
so exonerate her before she could even be
implicated that had been his idea not
for an instant did he suspect her he
loved her-had loved her for years he
trusted her implicitly and believed in her
underneath the modern flippancy the

saucy daring the heedless recklessness he
knew there was a real woman-sweet shy
innocent and he was determined that this
inner katherine-this real katherine-
should not suffer for the folly of that outer
sham-that product of civilization that the
world knew

   the first thing he said now with an
air of confident authority  is to send miss
kendall back to her party she must
dance-and laugh and jest with the others
-as though nothing unusual had happened
here we must let no one down there
guess it is going to be difficult he add-
ed with a new tenderness turning to the
girl  but you are strong enough - and
plucky enough - to manage it i know
besides ourselves the maid out there the
check-room boy and charlie nobody here
knows-except the murderer the others
must not have the slightest suspicion or
there would be a panic and the murderer
would find it easier to keep his guilty se-
cret as it is now we can watch for a
smile that tries to hide a trembling lip-
for eyes that seek to hide the hunted look
of fear-for ears that strain for the heavy
tread of the police you cant sit-hour
after hour-and hide these things he will
be wondering what is going on up here-
what we are thinking-what we are doing
but he will not dare ask we must keep
him in that state of suspense in six hours
who knows we may break his spirit-
wear out his endurance it is worth a
trial

    yes admitted silvers  youre right

   come said garry encouragingly lay-
ing his hand on katherines arm  ill
take you down-and well finish the dance
and ill leave you at the table with thi
others and disappear you must tease me
you must pretend i have been comman-
deered by a brazen little flapper in - in
pink and you must behave exactly as you
have always behaved-as happy-as care-
free

    ill try said katherine

  no that is not enough you must
manage it-do you understand he cried
earnestly - almost sternly  you must
realize that your reputation is in danger-
your life in fact i believe in vou-and

                   i	a
i the dance of death



im going to save you if its humanly pos-
sible but you must help me by guarding
against suspicion it is imperative

   ill do it said katherine then  and
-ill never-forget

  her voice wavered-broke-for the first
time in her reckless careless life she had
never taken anything seriously before but
she knew what was at stake now they all
knew the police courts-newspaper pub-
licity - a trial - perhaps imprisonment
the chair

  innocent women had been tried before-
and condemned circumstantial evidence
had a way of seeming hideously conclusive
-sometimes

  she rouged her lips anew-and touched
her cheeks delicately with her pink-tinted
puff she hastily repaired the damage her
tears had done her heart was very heavy

it had a weight on it that almost prevented
its beating but she smiled-and-even
silvers was moved by her courage-silvers
who did not believe in her as garry did-
who did not quite trust her

  they went down the stairs together
katherines hand trembling on his arm-
down into that noisy smoke-filled room-
back to the crash and blare and thump of
the jazz band the rattle of dishes the
noisy chatter and laughter of the revelers
supper was in full swing things that you
crack and get paper caps out of had been
passed to all-and many of the gayer ones
now had their hats on their heads they
had noise-making trinkets too to add to
the hilarity and din it was manhattan at
its maddest women painted and per-
fumed manicured and coiffed and draped
in clinging stuffs until they were like some
rare exotic flowers drooped across the ta-
bles flirting their feathered fans men
very young and vapid or very old and
coarse bent forward to meet them-ex-
changing whispered words and the wom-
en laughed too loudly-or rolled veiled and
languid eyes other couples clung together
swaying and turning but scarcely moving
their feet on the overcrowded floor it was
too hot in the room-too close

   to katherine-coming back to it all-
  it seemed hideous-unbearable-a night-
  mare place she shrank against garry

     	a

wondering if it had always been like this-
if she was seeing it as it really was for the
first time she shuddered and felt ill in
rooms like these she had spent her nights
for a year or more-ever since she had
finished school

   courage whispered garry carpenter

  she looked up at him and a sudden
warmth of gratitude to him surged into her
heart until it ached she smiled-and they
forced their way in among the dancers-
fought for place his arms about her
holding her so close filled her with a sense
of well-being-of comfort only he was
real these people-the noise-the music
-the dead man upstairs with the knife in
his throat - she had imagined them she
must have such things could not be-ex-
cept in some awful dream and yet she
recognized faces grinning at her-and she
smiled back and there was always that
icy chill deep down within her somewhere
-that nameless fear

  of guy da costa-the man guy da cos-
ta-she thought no more at all it was as
if he had never lived-as if his path had
never crossed hers his appeal for her
seemed to have died with him it had end-
ed as she had looked down with incredu-
lous horrified eyes to see him lying dead
upon the floor without thinking it out
or reasoning about it she felt that his pass-
ing had left no sense of loss-only a horrid
memory of a man with a knife in his throat
-his eyes wide open and glassy-his
mouth open too with a ghastly look

  the music stopped they started back
to their table and she put all thought of
da costa and his tragedy out of her mind
-smiled gayly as she tried to catch the
jest that garry was telling her

  the others received them back with much
noise and loud questioning and various
guesses concerning their absence but they
refused to answer and katherine obeying
orders laughingly described the vamping
of garry by a brazen little flapper in pink
this turned the attention on him as he
had meant it to and gave katherine time
to regain her poise she sank into a seat
between old mr coleman who was grow-
ing sleepy and young stanton wilcox who
was quite drunk her knees were trem-

bling but nobody noticed and like bart-
lett who sat across the room waiting be-
hind his screen of palms she too drank
champagne

  five minutes later when the band be-
gan again garry went off declaring that he
was going to find that girl in pink-and
katherine was left behind young wilcox

asked her to dance-and she rose at once
gayly to all intents and purposes the same
old katherine women are really wonder-
ful but inside - somewhere - she felt
very very changed-older graver grown
up into a woman at last and she knew
that she would never be the old katherine
again

     i thought id be a soldier
        and kill a flock of huns

and see a foreign country

   and shoot all kinds of guns

      so i gave up a dandy job
         and rushed down to enlist

      and said  i want to go to france

on this i shall insist

       i got a little training

policed around the tents

      thus collecting a few scents

i had my turn at peeling spuds

   cut bread and dished up chow

and often dodged inspection

i cannot tell you how

      i went down to the warehouse

      and countless endless g m cots

and things in box or crate

      the c o found that i could add

      so he put me in the office

and said to use my bean

the war got hot and heavy

      and troops went out to fight

      i worked like thunder all day long

      and cussed my luck at night

at last i wrote a letter home

        i cant a soldier be

take down the little sendee flag

  toskin buys a pbettv shanty boat

a pale blue shanty boat eddied down
muskrat bend and drifted against
 the mud bar just below mendova
there it was held by the bottom for a day
before any one noticed it then the sneak
a semicruiser belonging to the city police
department swung down into the eddy and
tappan at the wheel noticed that the
shanty boat was neither moored to stakes
nor anchored offshore

  when he entered the boat as he did after
hailing it and not receiving an answer he
found lying on the bunk a dead man the
body was stark and cold for murder bad
been done some one had shot the vic-
tim while he was sound asleep apparently
through a wnndow opposite the bunk

  tappan knew the mississippi as well as
any one he not only had the river police
experience but he had been third mate on
a river steamer for years and previous to
that he had been a rafter and towboat
hand and as a boy and young man he had
lived on shanty boats with his father an
old river storeboater and fur buyer he
knew the river signs with any of them

  with his whistle tappan summoned po-
liceman daker who patrolled front street
from the near side of which mendova wharf
was paved down to the current and part of
the paving was covered by the advancing
mud bar of the point above town daker
came running across the baked mud and
with tappan made as close an examination
of the shanty boat premises as possible in
order to leam what they could about the
circumstances and also to ascertain the iden-


argosy-allstory weekly

tity of the victim evidently everything
had been taken which would help serve this
purpose indicating a robbery motive

   there was nothing in the boat to disclose
 any secrets there was no scrap of news-
 paper not a bit of pencil writing on walls or
 in notebook no photographs of girls or men
 but a banjo standing in a corner was in-
 teresting it was a small instrument yet
 beautiful in make and tone as tappan
 found when he picked a bar of  trip me
 down the river finding the strings almost
 in perfect tune

  tappan examined the fingers of the
corpse but there was no least mark on the
tips to show that the victim was the banjo
player this fact led tappan to scrutinize
the instrument much more closely-but no
name was written on the head nor scratched
on the rim or neck

   the victim of the murder was five feet
eight inches tall with dark wavy hair dark
complexion dark brown eyes of slender
build and with no mark of real labor in his
appearance his clothes were all good his
coat and waistcoat hanging on a hook over
the bunk his trousers lying on a chair neat-
ly folded to preserve the creases and a shirt
that must have cost at least twelve dollars
was lying over the back of the chair

   in the waistcoat pocket was a thin ex-
pensive watch in the trouser pocket was
some small change two or three manicure
tools were in a case and the whole boat
was permeated with a rather strong per-
fume like musk in its weight but floral
rather than animal in its composition tap-
pan sniffed this perfume over and over
again and added it to his memories

   the dead truck was sent for and the
body removed to the morgue the evening
bat tie-ax voiced the general impression that
this was one of the unsolvable mysteries
that are the peculiar type of the mississippi
from cairo to the passes-a river mystery
which the father of waters would avenge
in its own way

   tappan being a mere policeman resigned
 the case to the city detective force and
 finger-print experts photographed the stove
 lid handle the pearl pocket knife blade and
 a dozen other features that might show
 something on comparison with the collec-

 tion of finger prints in the bertillon labora-
 tory but these revealed only prints of the
 victims own fingers and thumbs

   there was in the kitchen or galley of
 the little boat plenty of material for the
 microscopic and photomicrography amuse-
 ment and practice of the various department
 experts it was noticeable that the man had
 black tea as well as a fifty-five cent grade
 of coffee he was stocked up with supplies
 for a long trip down the river including a
 sack of flour in a moisture-proof tin can
 good quality bacon and ham a jar of sugar
 jug of sorghum and various things to eat
 the detectives told what a lot of things
 they deduced from the various edibles and
 the appearance of the boat tappan was
 not quoted at all

  but tappan knew a good many things
 which his up-the-bank detective associates
 had overlooked the hickory nuts in the
 bow hold were from the columbus hicko-
 ries the boat was a beautifully built craft
 with planed stringers tongue-and-groove
 planking roofing with matched board lining
 and five by five inch timber for oar pins
 and mooring heads the long sweeps for
 rowing the boat were beautifully balanced
 and the hull which was twenty-four feet
 long and seven feet wide rowed like a skiff

   the shanty boat was such a one as an
 old shanty boater would be apt to build
 it had been carefully constructed and there
 was not a drop of water in the hull and
 the cabin was almost perfectly dust-tight-
 it could lie down the lee of a mile-long sand
 bar and the wind of a norther would hardly
 blow puffs of dirt through any crack or
 seam

   for several days the detectives worked up
 and down the water front and had tappan
 take them up the river for miles trying to
 find some one who had seen the boat but
 the shanty boaters fishermen drifters and
 others up the bends and along the banks all
 denied any knowledge whatever of the boat
 two or three hundred people went to the
 morgue and viewed the victim but not one
 betrayed any personal interest in the matter

   the autopsy revealed what post mortem
 operations usually do reveal in such affairs
 the bullet had taken a certain course
 through sundry and divers wonderfully
the way of the mississippi



named parts organs and cavities and had
lodged under the skin in the back showing
as the coroner said that the murderer had
evidently stood over his victim and fired
straight down into the sleeping man but be-
cause the coroner and doctors said this
tappan began to wonder if it were true

  the pale blue shanty boat was towed
by the sneak up into fox river and moored
in the wild goose nest so called this
was a bend of fox river opposite runway
street where some willows and brush grew
along the bank here many shanty boaters
of a particular type landed in and pulled
out from time to time few places were of
more evil repute from the missouri river
forks to the gulf of mexico than the wild
goose nest above ferry street landing
however was the ducks nest where per-
fectly reputable shanty boaters and sport-
ing river trippers landed in

  the police department having learned all
there was to be found out about the shanty
boat which was absolutely nothing and
having photographed measured and scru-
tinized it turned the craft over to the cus-
todian of city property and about the time
the body was turned over to the medical
students the boat was offered for sale since
it was a nuisance to take care of it and an
expense to have it watched the ferryman
jim purple consented to be the boats
guardian provided he didnt have to touch
it or go aboard it

  for nearly a month the battle-ax carried
an advertisement that read

house boat for sale

     an elegant well-built cabin boat is offered
   for sale jo whom it may concern for a very
   reasonable price boat may be inspected at
   goose nest bend in fox river on application
   to ferryman purple custodian city property

  no price was fixed for it was felt that
any price would be acceptable though in
ordinary circumstances the craft would have
been worth five hundred to five hundred and
fifty dollars considering the outfit supplies
and all but there wtas no bidder till after
the story of the murder mystery had ceased
to appear in even the police hints where
four lines was the maximum length

  tappan continued to listen on the shanty

boats for some stray river rumor that might
help him he would go to the boats of new-
comers and with the casual uninquiring
river manner discourse on the stage of the
water and the luck of the hunters-all the
other things that are unleading questions for
any one to speak about and because he was
a river man himself tappan had many
friends among the river people and the
pirates river rats and even some kinds of
fugitives knew that he demanded only strict
observance of mendovas ordinances along
the river front but no one added anything
to the things which he already knew about
the dead man

  then he had an interesting fact to report
to the custodian of city property hap-
pening to be on fox river at the ferry one
day he found a young man standing on
purples float looking up and down with
wide-eyed interest tappan landed against
the float quite as though that had been
his intention and seeing his uniform the
young man walked up to him eagerly ask-
ing

   isnt the life in these house boats won-
derful

   yes sir tappan replied gravely and
with sincerity  theres nothing more won-
derful down thisaway than shanty boating
 thats just what i thought my name
is toskin-jerald toskin i am from new
york but this winter i said to myself that
i would not endure the cold my art course
is ended and i am coming down the mis-
sissippi i-ah-do you happen to know
whether it is possible to purchase a house
boat down here

   why yes-sometimes tappan nod-
ded and his eyes turned down the bank of
the fox to where he saw the pale blue
boat  theres one for sale now its a
nice tight boat not too large but just right
for comfort

   that blue boat is for sale toskin
cried eagerly  really why its a per-
fect beauty did you ever see anything so
appropriate for such a river bank as that
house boat

   it kind of fits into the sceneries for a
fact tappan said

   whod sell it

   why-er-its city property it be-


argosy-allstory weekly

longed to a man who-well hes through
with it and the city custodian has it in
charge now

   wherell i find the city custodian

   im his representative in a way this
is my beat-jrox river and the mendova
water front thats the police launch

   well i want that boat how much is
it

   it didnt cost less than five hundred and
fifty dollars to build and outfit it its for
sale for seventy-five dollars cash

   ill take it ill pay you now

   yes sir-ill give you a receipt too
tappan answered

  toskin drew a billfold and handed tap-
pan a fifty a twenty and a five dollar bill
tappan wrote out a receipt and then took
the young man and his suit case down to
the boat tappan unlocked the door and
they entered the cabin despite all that
had been on board and the investigations
still was permeated with the perfume

  why thats blended attars toskin
sniffed  isnt it lovely did it-was it
a womans

   not as anybody knows of tappan
shook his head  just some shanty boater
who dropped in and-and got his

   its just what ive been dreaming
about toskin cried im delighted
you see mr tappan ive just finished an
art course in new york for years and
years ive longed for the day when i should
be able to float with the current down the
mississippi river there are possibilities
down here for an artist-theres an atmos-
phere a spirit which if i could only catch
and fix it-um-m ive been mosdy an
illustrator i earned considerable in the ad-
vertising fields now-a dream ive had is
come true

   yes sir i expect tappan nodded
 its a nice boat 

   i have some things at the union sta-
tion and ill have them brought down
here-

   ill get them for you tappan said  if
theyre checked-

   thatd be very kind here they are-
sir

  tappan left the man on the shanty boat
and went to the landing where he tele-

phoned to the lnion station giving the
numbers of the checks and within twenty
minutes an express truck arrived with three
trunks tappan was unusually generous in
the matter the fact was he didnt want
toskin hiring a darky express drayman to
bring trunks to that shanty boat around
which there had already grown up a tradi-
tion

  putting the trunks onto the sneak he
dropped down to the boat and handed them
onto the stem deck toskin dragged them
through the galley into the main cabin
easily despite their weight he was a slen-
der graceful young man with a pallid coun-
tenance nervous energy and gray-green eyes
of large and emerald luster tappan ob-
served the strong reaction of the trunks to
the energetic grip-here was a healthy
youth as well as a temperamental one

  tappan showed the boats fine points
with river pride there was as well found
a galley-kitchen-pantry as ever floated old
mississip he explained and he showed the
oil stove the stores of supplies the table-
ware and the built-in sleeping car berth or
bunk from this had been removed all the
bedding but otherwise tappan said it was
the finest kind of an outfit

   probably they took the bedding for
something or other tappan remarked and
toskin said it didnt matter for he very
much preferred to supply his own bedding
he went with tappan uptown bought a
mattress sheets blankets and everything he
needed including fresh food supplies

  within three hours of his arrival at
fern- street jerald toskin was housed and
equipped and so great was his joy that he
cast off the lines and floated slowly down
fox river toward the mississippi with the
sneak a litue way behind and tappan
scowling and making covert gestures toward
the shanty boaters of both the ducks nest
and wild goose nest localities who had
come forth to see policeman tappans sale
of that murder boat to the softpaw who had
three tmnks with him

  and they saw the litue craft emerge from
the bayou river into the broad mississippi
turn half around in the swirl and then edge
out into the main current where tappan
held back leaving the stranger to row with
the way of the mississippi



his sweeps down into the long lonely bends
of the delta land

   ho law i wouldnt be in that theh
softpaws shoes not fo seven millvun dol-
lars jim purple voiced the river senti-
ment tentatively when tappan returned up
fox to hear what people would say

   hell get to know old mississip-thats
what he wants tappan grinned

chapter ii

   just naturally sentimental

 r i he river spirits are talking to-night

 denton rillard remarked to the
young lady on the stem of the
sacred concert boat whispering shoals  i
wish i could understand what they are
saying 

    you-you mean that she exclaimed
with an odd little break in her voice and
he felt her shiver through the telegraphy of
her hand on his elbow

   why not he answered lightly  you
-a river girl-dont you believe in such
things

   i was just wondering about you-all
she evaded  ive been-ive been looking
out there myself 

  no two people ever see all the same things
tripping down the mississippi it is said
yet there is no doubt that it frequently hap-
pens there are many witnesses to a strange
phenomenon these two rillard-a sports-
man out of the ohio-and dona voane a
river girl were on a quite common footing-
for he had said at least indicated the com-
ing to his ears of the low undulating whis-
perings where keenest of ears must have felt
only silence if they were without reverence
or at least belief

  it was black night but the darkness was
shaded the river itself was shimmering
dusky gray while the trees on the banks
were blacker and the sky was faintly pale
a sound suddenly rained upon them from
the sky it was a flock of wild geese mi-
grating southward and their a-lonktng their
trembling tinkling-bell voices fell to the
bottoms in a shower that passed by in a
minute or two probably a score of birds
were in the invisible flock-great beautiful

creatures lettering the heights perhaps
above the clouds and riding the skies to the
light of the stars

  from within the huge craft there sounded
human music that seemed far away and the
deck beneath the feet of the two began to
throb and spring to the dancing in the great
cabin a whiff of pungent wood smoke
caught their nostrils as a current of air came
swirling over the roof and around them
the long heavy stem line which led out
to the bank against which the bow of the
hull pressed strained as a water wave
heaved through the dead eddy and raised
them

   youre cold he asked quickly  per-
mit me-

   not cold not cold she whispered
 listen

  a splash miles away where some bank
was lumping off before the wear of the cur-
rent a little suckling gurgling as jets of
river current disputed the way a faint whin-
nying as muskrats discoursed down the
bank-a number of diverse and readily rec-
ognized noises broke the silence that brood-
ed but she shivered and he shivered to the
urge of another whole series of voices that
were not perhaps of the vibrant air

  they drew nearer together perhaps quite
unconsciously his right arm slipped around
her waist under the wrap that was over her
shoulders she did not resist him when he
discovered what he had done and dared
reach -with his other arm to draw her to him
no whispering river voices disturbed them
in that sudden unexpected moment she
gave him such a kiss as a river girl knows
how to give possibly no better or more to
it than other kisses but the environment
was a bit thrilling a bit overcoming-

  then as things happen on the mississippi
in the particular eddies of the river people
a door in the cabin was thrown wide open
and one of those lamps with concave mirror
reflectors threw a great rectangle of light
right out to where the two were standing
they stood revealed like a love scene and
instantly a man charged along the bright
flare cursing hoarsely

   mad tom-my god the giri choked

  no frail man this one who had listened
with her in the cool of the night while they


argosy-allstory weekly

sat out a set or two of the dances on the
boat with one hand rillard gently set the
girl to one side into the darkness of the
doors shadow and stepping back one stride
he caught the slender mad tom in his
stride and with a tremendous heave lifted
him up and headlong over the stern bumper
out over the water

   there for an instant mad tom sprawled
 in mid-air like a speared bullfrog and then
 still froglike he straightened out to his full
 length with his hands arrowed above his
 head curved and dived beautifully as any
 river rat would instinctively do with hardly
 a splash-a veritable otter plunge into the
 eddy

   except for the girls low terrorized gasp
 not a word or sound had been raised when
 a minute later some one working in the
 galley came into the corridor store room
 and found the door wide open she closed it
 and left the two again on the stern deck
 the girl in the meanwhile had dragged
 rillard into the shadow and was whisper-
 ing in his ears

   its mad tom oh-hell kill you
now hes bad-that man

    wtont he drown rillard asked won-
 deringly and with dread

   drown drown that scoundrel he
swam the mississippi a hundred times
hell swim a hundred yards underwater
you cant drown him oh you cant kill
him 

   she broke into a panic of soundless sob-
 bings and shudderings rillard who had
 come down the mississippi for no such ad-
 venture as this took her in his arms and
 sought to comfort her

  dont stay go away-go home she
gasped  when he comes youll not know
it-and the first youll know youll be
daid-daid

    but what ails him he asked still
stupidly undivining

  its me she said fiercely hes
hounded me dowil the missouri from the
yellowstone-and i hate him oh i de-
spise him-and im afraid-afraid

    well im not rillard said quietly

  well go in and dance wont we

   half his pirate crew are on board
theyd murder you-shoot you down like a

 dog if they knew theyd ben out here
 hunting you if theyd known hell be

    wait  she whispered and left him in
 two minutes she returned to reach a belt
 around his waist and buckle it on it was
 quite three inches wide folded over and
 sewed leather and on his right side where
 it fitted like bark on a tree was a flat open-
 top holster of the quick-draw man in the
 holster was a heavy revolver

    why-what- he said

    daddys  she replied  before some-
 body killed him were trippin down alone

  her voice was low sweet gentle and full
of the same kind of music he recognized in
the song of the wild geese-he wondered
what unpoetic scoundrel first called their
voice  honking  she was jeering him
while she told him the things that made
him wonder at himself his own conscience
too was taunting him there appeared
before his vision a young womans face
her eyes flaming her cheeks white with an-
ger her lips excoriating him for his faith-
lessness to her but here he was as this
river girl was reminding him all tangled up
in the meshes of a river scandal

   i-i didnt mean anything he gasped
witn sudden realization  i-i-

  it was supper time and as they entered
the music ceased while the couples sorted
themselves out for the sating planks laid
along carpenters horsas served for tables
and every one sal cn ocxes or chairs or
folding stools while steaming coffee was
poured into a great variety of cups from
plain tin to nickecj chinese and japanese

ware roast coon roast duck roast pork
and a dozen kinds of hot bread sweet and
spud potatoes-there was plenty to eat
and great appetites waited to enjoy what
was had

  there was a hush however when rillard
sat down with dona voane and with cour-
tesy brought to her plate the things she de-
sired to eat some of the men grinned
but some glared about with sudden quick-
ness of observation it was sensational this
moment

   say pete wheres tom-tom mai-
ton a shrill feminine voice startled the
sudden quiet

   jes what i was wondering pete davlo
replied with a grin

  all the spectators turned to gaze at ril-
lard the sport and dona who were ap-
parently quite oblivious to the interest taken
in them their indifference was just a little
too obvious

   wheres mad tom a whisper rippled
around the big kitchen-dining room
 whos seen mad tom-tom maiton
two men scrambled up and with covert
glances at rillard went around the table
ends through the concert-dance hall and
in the quiet their quick footsteps sounded
loudly as they drummed up the landing
stage to go along the bank to their boat
they were pals of mad tom

  they returned a few minutes later hav-
ing been heard whistling and calling around
their faces were dark with anger and sus-
picion tne of them stopped and looking
steadily at dona demanded

   say dona did you-all see him

   who she looked up quickly
 whod i see

   tom-tom maiton

   why yes he was here i saw him
prancin around sames always stepping
light and throwing himself just like he
thought he was somebody

   course-course the man exclaimed
startled by the tone  we all saw him but
whered he go

   i dont know jim taken unless he was
scairt out

   wha-wkatj mad tom scairt of any-
body why that man-

   i beg your pardon rillard interrupted

rising to his feet  theres your chair over
there and yours mr man is right yonderl
the ladies are sure missing your company
the two river men standing together
opened their mouths and their yes then
with sudden clicking of teeth and squinting
of eyes they dropped their hands but ril-
lard was before them he drew the big-
mouthed revolver which dona had handed
him and with a careless flourish beckoned
the two once more to the seats where they
belonged

   go talk to your own friends you men
rillard suggested softly  mad tom has
gone swimming and if he comes back you
tell him for me that after this hed better
mind his own business and all his pack of
river rats is that perfectly plain

  gone swimmin - gone a-swimmin
mad toms daid jim gasped  lawse
strangeh i-w-e meant no fense suh

    thats all right boys wrere all friends
theres no need of being mean or having
trouble im a softpaw i believe you call
it but where i came from no man ever talks
to a lady or looks at a lady the way you
looked at miss voane just tell her youre
sorry and it  be all right

  no fense mi-miss dona jim
blinked wetting his lips  i shore didnt
low to-to make vo mad no indeedy 
all right jim mr rillards a good
friend of mine and were both of us plumb
peaceable and so dont try no tricks for
you know im no softpaw an jim jes
about gettin started bad an mean mysef
 yesm he blinked and the two went
to their seats

   instantly every one began to eat rattling
dishes and talking in short shrill gasps
the amazing things they had seen and heard
made them talk of everything else but the
clash between the softpaw and mad toms
two mates jim taken and date imsal
with smiling eyes rillard had bluffed them
called them and ordered them around as he
might have sent a pair of dogs to lie down

  no one really believed he could get away
with any such talk as that but he had done
it and the two pirates were gulping down
their unchewed food handing it in with
both knife and fork while the women by
their side nibbled and flushed with embar-
the way of the mississippi



rassment that their companions should find
themselves in such a predicament of help-
lessness

   rillard was fairly unconscious of his posi-
tion in the river society he was less per-
turbed by the enmity of the pirate shanty
boaters whose undersized physiques and
cringing bearing under his own stem frown
and daring mislead him somewhat as to their
desperation than he was by another phase
of his conduct which the more he thought
about it the less he admired himself-and
especially the worse off he became as a mat-
ter of conscience

  the young woman dona voane sitting
beside him had done herself less than her
deserts when she said there were many pret-
tier than she she was of medium height
wavy light brown hair was massed upon
her head--and it was a wonderfully well-
rounded head her brows being broad and
high and her eyes full of lambent colors
that changed with her every mood among
them all she was very dainty and tactful in
her table manners and her voice despite a
dialect that she often exaggerated in order
to overcome her distinct enunciation and
her clearness of tone-she was hiding all
the time the education and the training she
had had up the bank somewhere

  rillard knew that she was what she
seemed and that she was a great deal more
than what she tried to claim to be yet
none of these attributes explained his own
inexplicable behavior now that he was trip-
ping down old mississip enjoying its splen-
dors but becoming more and more entan-
gled in its surface affairs he recalled his
remarks on the whispering river voices and
the music of the passing flight of wild geese
still rang in his ears-but he was suffo-
cated nearly by the fact that he had taken
this young woman in his arms and kissed
her

   and im respectable-im married-
good lord he choked to himself and on
the other hand he had not deceived dona
in fact he had called her corilla as of the
habit of his honorable intentions

  it seemed to him as though the night were
full of chuckles and the people were all
laughing at him-as indeed dona was
laughing at him as well as regarding him

with amused admiration he knew she was
regarding him w-ith a gentle ridicule for
her bearing was one of teasing he could
hardly believe the things he knew were true
but that weight of a beautiful heavy revol-
ver on his hip was undeniable

  he had plunged pell-mell into the feuds
and fancies of river living

chapter iii

an artist practices

jerald toskin having cut loose from
the bank of the mississippi floated
down the midstream and breathed deep-
ly in the inspiration of his wonderful experi-
ence at last with ample funds for a year
or two of river studies he was about to come
into his own field of endeavor

   these magnificent distances-can i ever
show that monster flood he asked himself
gazing in awe at the coiling and swirling
of the surface eddies led in his glance to
the miles distance down the visible slope
of the sweeping current

  he seized charcoal and tacked up a sheet
of drawing paper on his board to try by
sketches to catch the spirit of the things
which presented themselves to his eyes he
tried broad lines and fast strokes-and then
seized a sharp pencil tip and essayed the
effect with fine hard lines on a smooth
calendered surface which he soon covered
with india ink-and regarded the dozen
sketches he had made with equal disfavor
since the reality was so much more wonder-
ful than the mere suggestion of lines and
shades and strokes

  he forgot to eat his lunch he was so
busy with his art he studied the swirls of
the surface and watched the diminishing
spirals of the little sucks he dropped on his
hands and knees to look over side and
close at hand at the spreading of the boiling
glaze when jets from the bottom poured
up and swept out upon the surface in great
circling figures of many shapes trying to
catch the lines of the crinkling edges and
the weaving masses of silt as they fell into
shapes of their own weave he leaned
against the cabin of his boat and looked
at the low banks with their shadows of


argosy-allstory weekly

 overhang and purple mass with their tangles
 of tree roots exposed by the washing away
 of the earth dooming the forest in miles of
 caving bend and on approaching an island
 he saw on the right hand a wide vast lake
 in motion and down the chute on the other
 a rippling little river sparkling in the sun-
 shine-and a thousand effects a thousand
 spectacles challenged his skill and doomed
 him to the eternal strife of doing with a few
 pigments and all the paints and brushes
 available what the river was undertaking to
 show using the floods of a thousand valleys
 the light of the sun and the shadows of
 cyclone and hurricane clouds for its master
 effects

    oh yes  toskin blinked when in the
 twilight following sunset he rowed into an
 island eddy and heaved an anchor over-
 board near the edge of the main current
  theres no doubt in my mind that there
 are pictures down here-for one to paint
 my land-and i didnt take a photograph
 ive been fussing with sketching when i
 ought to have made photographs

   his heart sank within him as he wondered
 if he should ever again fce just precisely
 those same effects that had charmed and
 baffled him all the afternoon he caught up
 the work that he had attempted and by
 lamplight without the spectacle of the real-
 ity to shame his work by the truth he was
 startled to see and especially to feel in
 what he had done an undertone of spirit
 that just suggested itself to him-an atmos-
 phere of expression which lifted him to his
 tiptoes for it might mean at last a rudi-
 ment of style and themes of his own

   those sketches hasty crude and even to
 some extent snatches of the most common-
 place phenomena of the flood mass and far
 perspectives of the mississippi did reveal
 to him the fact that all his dreaming all his
 expenditure all his efforts were worth while
 and if he were to leave the river at this
 very moment he should not have come in
 vain a few quick scratches a sweep of
 charcoal a twist of the hand-as long as
 he lived that one bit surrounded by a
 dozen other attempts would inspire him
 with hope and confidence for he had seen
 and recorded in it the effect of a dozen acres
 of the mississippi surface with its ripples

 and breaks and reflections of the wilderness
 along the banks

   he went about cooking supper it was
surprising now that he thought of eating
how rapidly his hunger increased and he
broiled bis steak over the red-hot plate of
his oil stove fried potatoes percolated coffee
and made ample preparations to appease
his ravenous appetite having dined he
leaned back in a luxurious arm chair that
was part of the boats outfit and before he
knew it he was asleep never in his life
had he had a more engrossing day and
never had he been more tired

   it was after midnight when he awakened
 he looked around him and was a minute
 or two resolving his dreams of exhibitions
 in art galleries that were miles long and
 down both banks of the mississippi into the
 fact of his being afloat in a shanty boat
 he sat up and looked around himself with
 some satisfaction on a shelf in one comer
 of the room were several newspapers and
 he went to gather these up to read a little
 not realizing how long he had been lying
 there

   there were five or six of the papers and
 they showed that they had been carried
 around in peoples pockets he opened one
 of them and there across the full breadth
 of the first page was the headline

mysterious river murder

shanty boater victim of shot whik he
sleep on bunk 

   it was an account hurriedly thrown to-
gether by an evening newspaper reporter
and gave the salient details of the discovery
and mystery of the river crime toskin
read the story with interest though horrible
things had never attracted his fancy

  the other newspapers contained other
accounts of the investigation into the cir-
cumstances of the homicide and there in the
columns of the trade-caller was a picture
of the shanty boat a photograph of the
victim and more discussion of the missis-
sippi rivers penchant for strange and inex-
plicable crimes-here was a man who had
been murdered while he slept shanty
boaters declared a river man would nave
felt the boat shake and been awakened by
any one coming aboard no matter how
the way of the mississippi



silently and carefully since a touch will
make the floating craft vibrate noticeably

  toskin needed no back to his chair as he
read down this second day story over
and over again he looked at the picture
and there crept into his thoughts the feel-
ing that he must have seen that boat some-
where but not till he saw in a still later
paper a statement that the custodian of
public property would offer the mystery
murder boat for sale did it really occur to
him that when he purchased this beautiful
house boat all neatly painted all wonder-
fully equipped from the harbor policeman
he had acquired the very craft of that news-
paper sensation

   gracious he exclaimed looking
around him murder-ugh

  reading tragedy at midnight on the mis-
sissippi especially mississippi rivers own
strange brands of horrible circumstances is
not to be recommended save for those peo-
ple who are seeking sensations toskin
whether he knew it or not was undergoing
a bit of river lore

  when he looked at the bunk he could
see there the dim outlines of the very pic-
ture of the murder victim so vivid was
his imagination he felt himself shrinking
and the cold chills painting goose pimples
along his thighs and across the back of his
shoulders

  his lips were dry his throat dusty as
alkali but when he started to walk out into
the dark and gloomy kitchen where there
was a water pail but no light he stiffened
where he sat unable to move fear gripped
him-terror that grew within till the very
beating of his heart was thunder in the
silence of the cabin in the river quiet

  jerald toskin had trifled a little with
seances and mediumistic phenomena and
sometimes he had seen a ouiji board spell
out things which were startling and inex-
plicable the flutter of a curtain moved
by invisible powers the lifting of a table
under the gentle urge of a circle of hands
whose finger tips were on it messages across
the border land of ultimate adventure were
all well enough with ones own people
around but here in this boat

good land good land toskin
breathed  that-that blamed old cop

that blamed old cop thats why every-
body was rubbering-ah-ah

  he heard something it sounded as
though his anchor rope was stretching when
a current in the eddy pulled the shanty
boat about he felt a cold wave and no
iceberg out of greenland ever made a man
shudder more than toskin he turned
his head from side to side and he reverted
to another look at the bunk on which he
had read murder had been done

   its the boat-my boat my gawd
he thought and the hollow groan of his
voice checked him where he sat he trem-
bled and as he trembled he forced
himself to rise and walk steadily out
into the kitchen and around the end
of the partition into the pale shadow
and drink till his thirst was assuaged with
the water then he returned to the chair
and resumed his seat he picked up the
newspaper and read the several accounts of
the results of a ghastly tragedy

  when out of his subconsciousness welled
up whole flood tides of fears and dreads
he forced himself calmly to reason with
himself and urge away the terror by bring-
ing in the reign of his judgment but that
fight which he made with himself in those
long hours left its mark on his very soul
he won out but not by banishing the spec-
tres from him

  instead he accepted their presence he
told himself that far and wide across the
earth are the dismal places of violence and
cruelty and hate down the mississippi es-
pecially he was traversing the realms of ten
thousand steamboat war time and individ-
ual tragedies if he would do all these things
full justice it would not be merely by pretty
drawing and coloring of charming force-
ful current lines the crumbling down of un-
dermined banks the pitiful circumstance of
giant beautiful trees ready to fall in their
prime into the eddies more than these gen-
tle beauties he must show the darkness of
the deeps and the protest of the losers

  and when he had come to this resolution
he was astonished at the change he found
in his attitude he leaned forward on his
fist his elbow on his knee and gazed stead-
fastly at that bunk in the comer against
the kitchen partition he was not trying


argosy-allstory weekly

to see anything he was trying to under-
stand the situation he knew from the
pajers which reporters and detectives had
left on board all that was known generally
about the matter but the river knew the
answer-that great flood pouring by just
knew everything

   he walked out on the stem deck closed
the door behind him and looked as the glare
of the lamplight faded in his eyes out across
the waters at first he could see nothing
and then he saw more and more clearly an-
other most wonderful spectacle-the river
night the waters glimmered the far wilder-
ness seemed to be astir the near ripple down
the chute was whispering like many voices
scarcely audible there was as perfect a river
individuality in the night gloom as by the
flare of day

   the river however was not through with
jerald toskin-not by any possible means
was he a finished river man he had fought
his superstition he had overcome it and he
stood just a little too calm just a little too
proud of his heroic accomplishment old
mississip saw him sure enough

  from somewhere right around him came
a cry low and thrilling

  hep hep

   toskin nearly collapsed as with bulging
eyes he leaned forward and gaped out over
the water

    hep hep  the voice repeated high
and squeaky like a birds  i caint git to
move hep hep

   the artist all ready to begin his great
career now that his studies were over
leaned to see-and yet he was sure in his
very soul that if he saw anything it would
be with his minds eye and that any reply
he might have to make to that cry must
be with the voice of his soul alone

    its the murdered spirit  he thought to
himself  good lord-what can i do
what  i say to comfort im

   he projected his ideas into space and
wished that he had paid more attention to
the telepathic questions of the day and
wildly he groped about in his mind for the
proper forms of polite address at such a
moment

   then over the side he heard a splashing
in the water he heard the spattering of

something afloat and uneasy right by him
be heard a whispering wail

  hep hep im a-drownin
toskin leaned far over and looked and
there right under him was a face a mortally
white peaked face with eyes that fairly
glowed as they bulged

   my gawd my gawd toskin gur-
gled  what next

   there it was and as two hands were
lifted slowly the face submerged and in-
stantly there was a bubbling and gurgling
one long white bony hand brushed
against the side of the boat and the finger
tips worked around and along the planking
till they found the slight little crack where
a splinter had broken out there they
hooked in and the face emerged above the
surface again

   the other hand came squirming up out
of the water rising higher and higher and
as the face turned over the back of a mans
head showed sputtering choking gur-
gling the figure reached up and a white
hand hooked over the top of the gunwale

   straining there it was joined by the
other and toskin drew back with his own
two hands with long delicate fingers drawn
bone-rigid rising before him in deep-
breathed mortal expectation

   the river was pale the banks of earth
were revealed beneath the now visible mas-
sive trunks of trees a few yards distant
stretching away upstream was the gray dis-
tances of a sand bar turning yellow and
bluish toward the low switch willows

   if it had still remained dark there is no
 telling what jerald toskin would have en-
 dured or whether his excitement and ex-
 perience would have proved too much for
 him but this was the short moment of a
 lower mississippi dawn daylight was com-
 ing on apace and in a moment sunshine
 swept like a golden haze through the top
 twigs of the longshore forests

  the livid pale hands crawled and
reached straining over the gunwale and
alongside was the gasping and groaning of
something perhaps a man in the awful
struggle of a heart reluctant to die but
weakened and growing breathless

   toskin slowly realized that this was day-
 time he found it hard to overcome the
the way of the mississippi



 tense belief that the thing was a river spirit
 but when the truth dawned on him he
 sprang and seized the wrists of the figure
 and with a strength he did not know he
 possessed lifted the bedraggled figure over
 the side and then stretched him out on the
 deck

  it was indeed a man-a man pale and
shriveled by hours and hours of floating in
the water the necessity of struggling end-
ed the body fluttered a little and the eyes
closed in unconsciousness

chapter iv

  when a man has done something

by chance merely a number of shanty
boats had landed in the eddy where
merry-making had instantly sprung up
the arrival of the whispering shoals a
ninety-foot amusement craft making the in-
clusion of dancing perfectly inevitable
painted along the proportionately low
cabins side of the huge ark were the words

sacred concert boat

  a year or two previous to this day the
whispering shoals had come down the river
with a troupe of song birds on board stop-
ping at landings and giving entertainments
that neither love nor money would supply
in any ordinary theater up the banks sev-
eral were actually members of church choirs
and others were trained stage singers it
was a great lark this trip down the missis-
sippi and audiences at plantation landings
heard music they would remember many a
day

  now the boat belonged to the frindals
who threw the craft wide open to whatever
merriment was in the wind dick frindal
looked on all the doings with half closed
blue eves while his wife exchanged with him
looks of humor at some river antic or ex-
ploit on their hospitable floor they had two
hired deck hands and a woman cook-wife
of one of the hands rumor said they were
just a couple of rich folks seeing the river
other whispers said that they were living
out scouting down till some ill wind blew
over at least they were good sports and
no one would ever forget the winter the

frindals tripped the whispering shoals out
of evansville down to norleans

  with her bow to the bank and bow and
stern lines run off to port and starboard
steadying her held off by a long wheeled
and banistered gangplank the concert boat
was the nucleus of a shanty boat town or
duck nest other boats were moored along
the bank up and down the eddy and there
were two or three more boats against the
sand bar a hundred yards or so away and
nearer the main river current

  having danced the dark into day again
the river trippers emerged from the dance
hall and wtalked up onto the bank there to
turn to their own craft the spirit of mer-
riment had hardly flagged at all the wo-
men were laughing and talking the men
were still stepping to the tunes that ran in
their heads when a great fox squirrel
suddenly scampered up a tall cottonwood in
alarm seven or eight of the men snatched
out revolvers or automatics and began to
shoot a wild fusillade that chipped twigs
gashed the bole bark and plugged into the
body wood in chittering fear the squirrel
raced madly up and along a diminishing
branch leaped a dozen feet out and down
caught another branch and having lost four
or five inches of its tail which fluttered
down it made its frightened way to safety
while one of the shooters picked up the
fluffy trophy plucked out the bone and
handed the plume to his companion

  denton riiiard strolling along with
dona voane  seeing her home after the
manner of the wtorld-wide privilege found
her boat nearly half a mile downstream
at the very foot of the eddy and where
occasional swirls of the main current swung
in far enough to press the hull more firmly
against the bank

   it was a house boat about thirty-six feet
long ten wide and the hull was at least
three feet above the water surface on the
roof were elk horns and a wild mountain
sheeps head under the cabin porch roof
hung some ears of corn braided in their
shocks along both sides of the boat were
two running boards relic of old keel-boat
days and along the cabin were hooks on
which rested pikes of lodge-pole pine one
at least twenty feet in length

   a far traveler this boat it looked the
 journey it had made down the great length
 of the missouri that two women had
 floated it down most of the way was almost
 incredible but such was the fact the
 mother of dona walked out on the bow
 deck as the two approached and fixed ril-
 lard with the squinting stare of her sus-
 picious eyes-her visage was dark aquiline
 and betrayed the faintest dash of indian
 and a great deal of latin-probably french

   mr rillard mother dona intro-
duced them  hes the sport we heard
about-coming down out of the ohio

    glad to met you mr rillard the
elder woman nodded not ungraciously  i
expect you-all think shanty boating is right
amusing dont you

    its a liberal education i should say
 he said and at that the girl laughed lightly
 saying

 mad tom maitons pirates were mostly
there and mr rillard-sho mother he
was there first and it left me nothing to do 
 you had it out mrs voane inquired
quickly

   mad tom was mean-and fell over-
board jim taken and date imsal grew
impudent but went and sat by their lady
friends when mr rillard told them to

   the sharp suspicion in mrs voanes eyes
 relaxed and her lips smiled sincerely
 rhere was relief in her expression too and
 rillard unable to conceal his wonderment
 was invited on board their boat to breakfast
 ostensibly but in fact to hear the brief
 narrative of the mother

   over their buckwheat cakes and pork sage
 sausage mrs voane said

    its real friendly of you taking up this
 matter for us mad toms always been
 mean about dona here he lowed hed sure
 get to marry her when she was only ten-
 twelve years old and we were on illinois
 river daddy sent her to school thinking
 that scoundrel would sure forget but he
 never did-and account of dona growing
 prettier nobody could rightly blame him
 but dona feared and despised him last
 night knowing theyd be coming down-
 for theyve trailed us a thousand miles-she
 went to the dance i dassent to leave the
 boat alone for theyd pirate it just to worry

 us and leave us begging for a night aboard
 some friends boat dona carried her dad-
 dys gun-i see youre wearing it mr ril-
 lard is mad tom daid

   he went a-swimming dona laughed
 came charging like a buck deer with his
head down- lawse mr rillard stepped
to one side and hoisted him-up and
out-

   he could swim like a fish like an
otter  mrs voane exclaimed disappointed

    but before letting him go he twitched
 his neck dona added

    an he drowned

    if he came up he didnt come splash-
 ing dona shook her head  itd be like
 old mississip to drown him-but hes a fish
 in the water

   after breakfast rillard went to his own
 craft a pretty cruising motor boat model
 hull and driven by a screw propeller it
 was swinging from the stem deck of char-
 lie bookss pink storeboat because the draft
 was pretty deep for landing against the
 bank as he approached the storeboat
 mrs mamie books opened the door for
 him and closed it behind him as she beck-
 oned him into the cabin behind the store
 with its shelves and counter

  mr man charlie books whispered
 youve sure done something dont you
know that jim taken and date imsal will
kill you-all in cold blood why theyre 
-his voice lowered- theyre riveh pirates
of mad toms crew lawse-nobody
knows how many or whos of them if
mad tom d ben theh youd neveh left
that boat alive-

    well mad tom wasnt there rillard
suggested

   sho-what 

   but he was mrs mamie turned to
her husband her eyes widening  long
early he was theh-i danced with him

   the two turned to look at rillard he
made no comment and they dared ask no
questions yet they were alert to the pos-
sibilities of the situation to the subtle hint
in his one statement that mad tom was
gone when he defied the two river scoun-
drels

   have a cup of coffee mrs mamie
suggested and he assented but explained

                         	a
the way of the mississippi



that he had just eaten breakfast on board
the voane boat

   you di-id mamie cried once more
surprised  ho law-man youre flying
high but coming down to light where mad
tom sure lowed is his own country 

   then rather than embarrass their visitor
they told what a fine dance it had been how
they enjoyed the music and how the win-
ter down the river was going to be like old
times as in the days when anybody could
kill all the wild fowl he wanted and when
every brake and bayou was alive with fur
and game then rillard went home to his
boat to rest

  late in the day when he awakened most
of the shanty boaters were up and busy
blue smoke poured out of the stovepipes in
the roofs and there was wood-chopping on
the bank there was high-pitched feminine
singing a weird low strain of a fiddle sev-
eral whistlers vying with one another in
their warblings and thrills and piercing
shrills the sky was a bit misty and the
sun was shining with diffused whiteness
upon the tawny flood the downstream reach
thickening till the faraway bend was but
a faint hardly visible hue of pale blue

  mad tom charlie books said had dis-
appeared his gang were together on their
gasolines and shack boats against the sand
bar talking among themselves their
surly aspect and their low growling as they
looked out at the sports motor boat jungle
left little to the imagination

   theyre mean books declared

 when you get down the river alone look
out keep yo eyes open mr man
they low you tricked them but if mad
toms daid theyll scatter an theys
afeared of you-yes indeedy five ten
of them saw yo bluff down jim taken an
date imsal ho law i wouldnt omissed
seein that not fo a bale of beaver skim
lawse theyll neveh front yo to yo face
-no indeedy but bushwhackin-shoot-
in from behind don yo turn yo back on
any man yo dont know-an neveh follow
the same road twicet neveh tell any man
where you stop where yoll go or when
yoll come back an come night pull down
yo curtains shut the dor an when yo
step outside have no light behind yo i 

  rillard looked up and down the river he
went out on the bank and talked the time of
day with his fellows he strolled down the
bank with an assumption of ease that he
did not feel and sitting on the bow deck
of the voane boat heard from donas own
lips a repetition of the warning that books
had given him it thrilled his love of ven-
ture to hear her concern about his jeopardy
as a boy he had dreamed of fronting des-
perate and treacherous enemies now the
reality was all that his boyish imagination
had pictured to him it was quite as in-
credible but the reality was not to be ques-
tioned

   he was a participant in a river feud

  one other thing struck his fancy with
satisfaction it was all a river affair he
was more than a thousand miles from home
he was with a kind of people of whose ex-
istence he had never read though he had
heard occasional rumors that river shanty
boaters were a strange class certainly there
was hardly a chance of the rumor of any-
thing he did down there reaching his far-
away home town to alarm his friends and
delight his fewt and unimportant enemies

  the feeling that he would never be found
out threw a glamor over his condition and
added to the discomfiture of his conscience
no harm could come of this affair lie
would not be shot or killed-he would at-
tend to that courage and alertness would
be with him and when toward sunset he
saw the dirty little shanty boat the two
stern wheel scows and the old weathered
gasoline launch of the pirate fleet pull out
into the eddy and turn across into the main
current he was completely satisfied

  they had not remained there to have it
out with him the eddy was not large
enough for them the voanes and himself
the pirates had fled and it was a real
psychological victory when the pirates
were vanishing in the thickening down the
reach the shanty boaters gathered in groups
and exclaimed among themselves dona
turned and laughed aloud as she looked with
roguish frankness into rillards eyes

   theyve gone yo sure scairt em out
mr man mother an i sure must thank
you suh they lowed yo came down here
to ask how yo could help us-


argosy-allstory weekly

    i was really wondering just that he
admitted

    and they knew it youre being friend-
ly with us if mad toms daid it  stop
any one from pesterin mother and i any
more i wish i could do as much for you
stranger

   the word stranger gave the wish just ex-
actly the right balance the visitor returned
with the coming of dusk to his own boat
and pondered on the ways of the mississippi
with all its people

chapter v

a favor to a river pirate

jerald toskin lifted and carried the
inert body of the man out of the river
into his cabin and there managed to
put him to bed he found under his clothes
a money belt thick and wet with currency
that had long been saturated and this
money he spread out over the oil stove in
the kitchen to dry it there were two au-
tomatic pistols of small size light in weight
but of exceedingly efficient design and these
toskin took apart and cleaned

   tired out with his nights vigil exhausted
by his terror and struggle with his fears he
too turned in to sleep and slept for hours
when night fell and he awakened the other
man was lying less like a dead man and
breathing deeply sleeping off the effects of
whatever his own weariness had been he
slept all that night while toskin spent the
evening sitting back in the comer of the
cabin his sketching easel before him and
making notes of the exact scene in that
room

   he knew now with an artists instinct
that he had been blessed with what no im-
agination could have raised up for portrayal
-or at least only a genius could have
dreamed he had seen the river spirits he
had heard their voices and he had at the
same time come into his own material for
the delineating of the mississippi in its
phase of psychological mystery and its
fearfulness of actual living aspects that
white hand coming up out of the dark
depths and hooking over the gunwale
would ever remain as one of his most pre-

cious notes for drawing into any picture of
terror or strain that he might desire to em-
bellish

  realism-he should now never lack for
the gaunt livid truth of a mans physical
exhaustion and he knew if he ever drew
a picture of the mississippi it would con-
tain the most careful exact kind of draw-
ing but it would also contain the subtlety
of atmosphere and the spirit of mystery-
no matter how much he would put into any
breadth of canvas or spread of paper there
would lurk in and under and around his
subject the shadow that is so much more
than substance the suggestion that is far
more than the mere lines and colors

   it had been a small price to pay for what
he had gained during that awful night of
realities through the years his agitation
his fear his almost lost fight with the cow-
ardice that is every mans trial would stand
with him when a man has won such a de-
cisive victorr over himself he may count
on a thousandfold greater strength-per-
haps an utter calm-in whatever emergency
may arise to try him he may even go
into the inevitable peril that becomes ir-
resistible attack he may die but with un-
flinching steadfastness since he has been
prepared for that by an agony of terror
long since met and overcome

   toskin still felt the brooding menace of
the river night he was wholly conscious of
the possibilities of the dark of the murder
shanty boat of the unseen but he was not
afraid he could with quiet observation
study his own reactions to the new sounds
the new spirits the more sensitive feelings
instead of mere glimpses and glances of im-
pressions he now analyzed the things that
gave him these feelings and when he
sketched the simple attractive interior of
the boat with that white face on the bunk
he added-as a note to jog his memory-
a tiny bell uptilted as though ringing to
show that he was listening to bell-like music
out across the river-not really instrumental
music but the ringing tread and the boom-
ing march of the vast river flood swinging
down reach and bend to its rest in the gulf
of mexico

  almost unconsciously he sketched that
bell in one corner of the cabin but after-
the way of the mississippi



ward looking at it he knew that if he never
made another sketch of the river-that bell
showed how much he understocxl and how
far he had come in knowing whereof he
longed to speak

  swinging a canvas hammock across the
cabin toskin rolled up in a blanket and
went sound to sleep in the morning some-
thing awakened him and opening his eyes
he found himself looking up into the face
of the man he had dragged out of the eddy
in the mans hand was his own butcher
knife and he was merely hesitating to drive
the blade into his hosts breast

   good morning toskin greeted the
man looking him in the eyes

   wheres my money belt the fellow
demanded

   it was all wet when i pulled you out of
the river toskin answered  i spread
the bills on the rack over the stove-where
youll find them

  on the instant the river rat backed away
and took a quick glance at the kitchen
where sure enough the currency was crin-
kled up well dried-several thousand dol-
lars in bills of various denominations at
sight of it he sprang and rapidly stacked
it to pack it in the stained but fairly soft
horsehide money belt he counted it and
he was satisfied with the result not a
dollar was missing

  in the meanwhile toskin reached over
into a wall pocket and drew out his own
automatic swung to his feet and as the man
looked up leveled the dark brown muzzle
at him

   you scoundrel-hands up kill me for
rescuing you will you

   dont-dont shoot the fellow
dropped his knife and fell to his knees  i
lowed yod-yod stoled my money  dont
shoot

  toskin ordered him to put on the belt
and made him sit down in a chair while he
himself dressed murder had been in the
very poise of the fellow and toskin some-
how had found river discretion in his short
but terrific shanty boat experience
dressed he told the man to dress in the
clothes which toskin had carefully dried

   you were floating down and came into
this eddy toskin explained  i heard

you groaning just before daybreak and you
drifted against my boat you hung fast
but youd sank back in shortly i dragged
you on board took you in here and fed
you i let you sleep on my own bed-and
for thanks you would have stabbed me while
 slept who are you

  tom-tom maiton the fellow an-
swered as he cringed

   a river rat

   yas suh

   and all the good it does to do you a
favor is to give you a chance to murder your
benefactor

    lowed yod took my money

   if i had-youd murdered the victim if
you found that much money on him
youre alive-and you thought id robbed
you helpless as you were

   i lowed yo had suh

   because youd done it you thought i
would-that any man would where did
you learn to mistrust men so much

  on ol mississip-all oveh

  well if you were in my place what
would you do

   the jobd ben done long sincet mai-
ton grinned with a flicker at his own humor
 yod neveh come to no suh

   i believe you now if i let you go i
suppose youll stab me the first chance you
get-or shoot me

  maiton hesitated and stared at the floor
what could he say he rolled his eyes up
at last-they were half bulging in their
deep sunk sockets-they wavered and a
rat-tail grin whipped along his lips as he
nodded

   i expect suh

  he was telling the truth and it was the
only way he could repay the man who had
saved his life-it was the truth of the mo-
ment however toskin was delving deep
into the heart thought of the wretch to
him had been given as to few softpaws on
the river the privilege of getting to know
old mississip in the snarling moods of its
ways and he knew it-he was grateful for
it nor did he bear any resentment against
the man now in fact he read back into
the years of privation of suffering of losing
fight against odds on the river of a weak
physique struggling to keep alive against


argosy-allstory weekly

the awful law of the survival of the fittest
he had survived-he was surviving now by
the very sincerity of his admissions he
was learning to meet toskin on toskins
own terms-for there was no other way

  unable to look back at toskins frank
and studious inspection maiton rolled his
eyes around and his glance fell on the easel
where rested the wide sheet of drawing
paper covered over with the sketch of the
bunk the comer of the cabin the hanging
curtain by the window and the glaring
white face that centered and held his vision

  maitons jaw dropped his eyes crawled
out of their sockets like turtle heads and
he staggered to his feet staring at the pic-
ture it was a wonderful likeness that
hasty sketch having looked at it mai-
tons gaze wandered up and down and
around the cabin he looked at the carlings
supporting the matched board canvas-cov-
ered roof he glanced at the cabin walls and
shrank away from each side in turn he
drew down his back humping as he fixed
his eyes upon the bunk blinking again and
again

   this boat-this shanty boat-where
alld yo get to buy hit misteh he asked

  toskin stood straighter a little and looked
at the fellow with a quick birdlike glance of
amused comprehension maiton knew that
cabin interior and he was undergoing tor-
tures in the recognition the artist knew
now how well he had drawn the face and
figure of the wretched river man recuperat-
ing in almost deathlike sleep on that bunk

   whered yo git hit maiton pleaded
 not to-not to mendova

   its one the city custodian had for sale
its a dandy isnt it toskin smiled as
he put this question

  ah-ah maiton gasped and then
asked pointing at the picture  where
aild yo see that man-lyin theh-so

  for an instant toskin hesitated and then
reached to a shelf and handed him the news-
paper with the picture of the murdered man
in it

   theres the picture but you know thats
your own face

   lawse lawsy maiton whimpered
 i knowed hits my face but a daid mans
on a daid mans bed an-an yove heam

no voices-seen nobody here ceptin me-
no night flyers have come a-visitin yo

   oh as to that-you see that bell

    yas suh 

    i heard it ringing-not a real bell you
know-so i sketched that in in order that
i might never forget it

    forget the voices of the riveh speerits
maiton cried  you expaict yod eveh fo-
get em havin heard em wunst ho law

   no suh kind of laid his hand onto
hit an i couldnt hep mysef i kep a
goin-a goin gettin number an numb-
er come daylight when yo fished me out
les look out

  he went on the bow deck and looked
around toskin stood in the doorway
watching him as he looked up the chute
and to the left across the main river

    yas suh i floated twenty miles stran-
geh jes floatin lyin on my back all
paralyzed my haid throwed back down
reach n bend down crossin an chute an
-hit were here yo drug me out i mem-

hull hookin my fingehs into the strake
crack sho ol mississip brung me hyar
to this bot-a daid mans bot lawse-
lawsy  mississip had hit in fo me-he
shore did yas suh

  staggering maiton sank into the old
green wicker chair on the deck he sat
there mumbling and nodding to the wan-
dering of his own thoughts on him had
settled one of the mississippi river convic-
tions and he whined with helpless misery
and futile wish

   stranger - stranger  - he turned to
toskin one hand reaching suddenly to the
the way of the mississippi



back of his neck as it creaked stiffly- i
lied strangeh id neveh kill yo-all-not
in gawds world-neveh

   i thought so toskin smiled  come
in anti well have a cup of coffee and break-
fast-what say

   yas suh but-that cabin ho law
do yo-all blieve in ghosts

   believe in ghosts toskin laughed
 why yes-after a fashion id hate a
lot not to believe in them you know take
a real nice good-natured ghost now and
hes lots of company

   sho shof maiton exclaimed and then
grinning wryly stepped lightly the length
of the cabin swinging wide from the bunk
and working in the kitchen to help make
the breakfast which both of them needed

  when they had eaten they washed and
dried the dishes put them away and re-
turned into the sitting room as before
maiton kept covert eye on the bunk as
though he would be ready should it rise up
and fly at him on the other hand catch-
ing another glimpse of the picture on the
easel he shied at it too while toskin re-
garded him with the amusement of a man
who has become well rid of his own fright

   you do not like my cabin boat tos-
kin suggested

   just so maiton admitted sitting gin-
gerly in the rocking chair to which his host
beckoned  i fear no man-but the devils
own- law me

   the newspapers say that the dead man
was a mystery-none knew his name
hinted toskin

   no more did i maiton said stoutly
 howdi know him

   that is none of my business toskin
shook his head with sudden discretion  i
believe a man should mind his own busi-
ness-

   thats moren many a softpaw gets to
know tis a wise man who knows what
isnt his business whats the idea of that
damned picture

   i didnt want to forget how you looked
lying there

   an i looked like a daid man-did i
whites that whats the meaning of that
sign wih you tell me that

  m sign meaning of what sign

   you draw my picture-and its my daid
face into hit

   oh lots of artists make their portraits
dead-or wooden

   but that thing-im a daid man in a
daid mans bed maitons cream-colored
complexion turned ash-gray he quivered
as he glared at the portrait seeing his own
profile the gaunt deep wrinkles of his own
face and the lifeless relaxation of his figure
right where the murdered man had lain

   as night fell the river rat was shivering
with dread toskin could laugh at him
now at the same time he was sorry for
the man knowing full well what he was suf-
fering he could not help but speculate on
the visitors knowledge of the boats trag-
edy but he knew far too much by this time
to give voice to hint or inquiry in the mat-
ter

  maiton warmed slowly in the fearless
poise of his host

   you-all know a daid man slept theh-
an youre not afeared misteh tom mai-
ton asked

   i think-dont you-that i would bet-
ter fear the living more toskin asked
in turn with crisp meaning in his tone
v  yas suh yas suh  maiton acknowl-
edged  two men near laid daid on that
bunk-yas indeedy-

   three toskin added  i was closer
to dying than you were when i lifted you
on there and fed you warmed you with hot
clothes-brought you back from almost
complete exhaustion to sleep and rest

   i know yo did-now-yas suh mai-
ton acknowledged shamed  listen

  in the darkness without they heard
motors and maiton stepped to the bow
deck to hear better

    hits friends of mine he whispered to
toskin in the darkness and raising his voice
through his megaphoned hands he gave an
 aloo-hoo  call an answer returned from
the river darkness and a minute or two
later the dark craft approached in the
gloom one of the men turned on a spotlight
and sought out the little shanty boat
there was a brief interval of silence and
then there was a shrill low scream

dangling river temptations

denton rillard felt his grip on
affairs slipping sensibly as he regarded
the situation in which he now found
himself old mississip had captivated him
and he asked himself the most fatal of all
questions to consider

    whod know anything about it

  his surface thoughts were innocent
enough but away down underneath was
what they call a hankering for adventure-
affected considerably by the fear of people
misunderstanding him if he happened to
be caught at it he could not quite regard
the gay and questionable incidents of the
big concert boat river dance with complete
regret he had kissed dona with consider-
able enthusiasm he admitted to himself
but with such an indifference that no one
should object to it-even corilla if she
would only understand it as well as he did
the surprise unexpectedness and natural-
ness of it

   at the same time thinking of the river
desperados indignant charge and his
prompt and scientific bafflement and expul-
sion rillard wondered if he had killed a
man certainly that practiced thumbing of
mad toms neck had crippled the river rat
and numbed men in water have little chance
of escape from drowning

   the vicious jealousy of the man had
been of course perfectly foolish rillard
was merely a spectator and all that as he
assured himself but there was one deep
satisfaction for him nobody ever paid any
attention to what shanty boaters did or
what happened to people down the missis-
sippi river one might read a thousand
newspapers and never learn anything about
the mississippi except that sometimes it had
some awful floods and sometimes it needed
a hundred millions to make it navigable
since coming below cairo out of the ohio
rillard had heard forty stories at least
which would have made good news yams if
any reporter had heard them but apparent-v

oh ly the only reports of the mississippi were
issued by waterway conventions and the
wteather bureau

   he thrilled with dismay as he thought of
what a newspaper man would do with the
story of hon denton rillards feud with
pirates undertaken to save a pretty river
girl from their attentions that phase of
the matter was fit to make him reel with ex-
citement over and over again he reassured
himself that what happened on the missis-
sippi was a closed book as regards up-the-
bank knowledge

   accordingly without many misgivings he
dropped out of the eddy with the voane
boat made fast to it down the crossing and
thus saved the women on board the neces-
sity of steering or pulling it with their
sweeps the power of his own motor would
take the big house boat upstream if need
be

   worst of all perhaps he assented to din-
ing on board their boat where the natural-
ness and ease with which the women acted
greatly assisted him in maintaining a strict-
ly decorous attitude of distant friendliness
there was not the least deceit on his part
when he landed at cypress he explained his
necessity by saying that he expected let-
ters from his wife and business associates
neither of the women showed the least sign
of surprise or feeling on learning that he was
married in fact they had known it right
along

   there was never lack for something to
talk about mrs voane had lived on the
mississippi for nearly twenty years and
previous to that had been a montana pros-
pectors daughter living from camp to
camp and she was now a woman of some
little property and asked rillards advice
about investing several hundred dollars of
income from mine stock dividends that hap-
pened to come to her at memphis where
they ran down ash slough

   two days later they landed in at st
francis towhead near the st francis river
mouth a flock of wild geese came flying
by low down and dona stepped outside
with a long-barreled thirty-eight caliber re-
volver as they began to climb she threw
the weapon up and fired six times the
range was from twenty yards to about
the way of the mississippi



eighty yards and four of the great birds
came flopping end over end to the rippled
sand it was wonderful shooting rillard
had never seen anything like it

  as he saw how the bullets had center-
plumbed the unhappy birdshe was startled
by another thought-this girl was perfect-
ly competent to take care of herself he
turned and looked at her with some little
alarm and was just in time to see the quiet
smile and the uprolling eyes of a young
woman who knew that she had amazed and
shaken a man beyond any idea that he had
previously expressed she was laughing at
him and worst of all he rather enjoyed
the discovery that she was so much more
capable than he had supposed possible

  right then however was the ending of
his legitimate guardianship-with his own
discovery of its needlessness tui that mo-
ment he could have shown a proof of in-
different gallantry to any court to which
his conscience might appeal barring per-
haps gorilla herself who would have been
rather biased in all probability now
stripped of any ignorance he might have
pleaded he stiffened his neck with the ob-
servation that nobody would ever know
that he had accompanied two shanty boat-
ers widow and daughter some two or three
hundred miles down the lonely mississippi

  nobody-that is except shanty boaters
apparently the voanes knew about every-
body down the mississippi they stopped
in eddies reaches and bends they visited
fishermens tents up the bank commissaries
over the levees and remained three days at
a logging camp because they knew the
foreman-an old friend of voane

  where the coon hunting was good dona
brought out her own and her fathers pow-
erful headlights adjusted the latter to ril-
lards yachting cap and took him out upon
the wooded bottoms to initiate him in the
mysteries of fixe hunting

  it was rare sport he shot three coons in
one dark corner brake above st francis
towhead and when they were turned
around in the cane his wrist compass en-
abled them to find their way back to the
river bank he would not have missed the
wast two-year-old coon which dona baked
-not for money anyhow

  returning to the big shanty boat and
cruiser in their little skiff driven by an out-
board motor they found another boat float-
ing down the midstream with doors open
and deaf to any hail turning their head-
lights on it they saw that the bunk in the
cabin was empty and that no one was on
board

  they ran alongside dropped a line on
one of the oar pinheads and swung it into
the towhead eddy and anchored it there
going up to the young womans boat ril-
lard helped her to the stern deck and him-
self sprang up lightly they stood there in
the gray darkness of  am it was just as
natural to go hunting coons at night down
the mississippi as hunting grouse on an
afternoon from an adirondack camp or
pennsylvania clubhouse

   youre teaching me a lot about living
down the mississippi he said with sudden
realization

   theres a lot to learn yet she chuck-
led  id better tell you-mad tom isnt
dead he floated down about twenty miles
and a softpaw artist from down east some-
where picked him up theyre all waiting
for us down by white river or arkansaw
old mouth mad tom an his pirate crew

   waiting for us

   yas suh-passed us by and didnt
know hit

  why-why-

   its fair warnin theyre mean that
pirate crew theyll shoot yo if they can
im all right they come round this boat
an ill shoot fustest an ask questions if
necessary afterward but im powerful
worried about you suh likely yod betteh
quit the riveh-the farther down yo go
the worse off yo be till yo go down chaf-
felli where yo dont come back

  there it was again-the challenge of old
mississip rillard rose on his tiptoes al-
most unconsciously and he turned to look
down the river where helenas lights were
sparkling and shining nine or ten miles dis-
tant just that way a crisis had come to
him- and he just couldnt resist the circum-
stances

  returning on board his boat he tried to
give the situation serious and sensible conr
sideration he knew there was only a dir

lemma for choice-he must stay with the
river and all its strangely fascinating at-
tractions and dangers or he must make
haste back up-the-bank to his own country
and his own people

   he hesitated dallied with the various
considerations asked himself if a real man
could with honor permit a gang of river
desperadoes to drive him from the naviga-
ble highway he allowed himself to remem-
ber the cunning and attractive dona only
as an interesting young river woman of a
discreetly friendly type-but he knew
down in his heart that there was really
only one thing to do-quit

  for a minute he determined to do so
but recalled that he still had donas beau-
tiful revolver the cheyenne belt and quick-
draw holster he could not go away with
that and it was too late to hand it aboard
in passing out of the eddy and accordingly
he turned in and tossed uneasily in his little
stateroom bunk long before he could sleep
but sleeping at last he slept late and was
only awakened when from alongside came
the hail of dona telling him breakfast was
ready-pork sage sausage hot bread and
pan-browned milk gravy drip coffee and
buckwheat cakes wild honey and the like
all cooked in river fashion

   it was a quiet breakfast the two watched
him covertly wondering what he would
do whether he would succumb to the grav-
ity of his danger and leave the river or
whether he would go down and confront the
river wretches taking their challenge

   he did not enlighten them after break-
fast he and dona went to the little shanty
boat which they had salvaged the previous
night as it floated lost down the mid-cur-
rent it gave evidence of another mystery
whoever had lived on board had thrown
his clothes over a chair and gone to bed
the bed had been slept in it wras a single
iron bedstead with everything clean and
neat cold cooked meat and raised buck-
wheat batter cakes were ready for break-
fast even coffee was in the percolator
hanging over the head of the bed was a
money belt containing eight hundred and
fifty dollars but no name and no address
on the wall beside the pillow was a heavy
army automatic loaded and the safety on

showing that it was ready for instant use
in a corner were two firearms a twenty
gauge repeater and a twenty-five-thirty-five
automatic rifle

   what was the answer

   dona said

    his lines are all coiled up but his an-
chor is wet and muddy what that man did
was walk up in his sleep hoist his anchor
and then-fall overboard perhaps he
couldnt swim and drowned perhaps the
shock of frosty upper mississippi water
chilled and cramped him perhaps he
reached the bank and dont know what had
happened to him many a man walks in
his sleep dowrn this shanty boatin riveh-
and to that kind things happen-sho i
neveh saw this boat before and its riveh
built twenty-two foot long six and a half
foot wide low cabin deep hull who knows
what happened on hit

    what  we do with it

    hits worth with that money a thou-
sand dollars there may be more into it
wed better search

  they ransacked the boat from bow to
sternunder decks in the pump hole through
pockets and boxes and the trunk the
trunk a square-cornered iron-strapped con-
tainer contained packs of cards all marked
and new except three poker chips several
sets of dice some square-cornered and some
round-and as she remarked after rolling
them a few times all were loaded or
trimmed to win and lose a dozen books
hoyles draughts chess told of a gamesters
studies there was a book of river maps
and maps of colorado arizona idaho and
new york citys metropolitan district

   the boat itself had no gambling con-
veniences merely a swing table and a small
cook stove a kitchen-galley well provided
with grub plenty of assorted ammunition
for the firearms and from end to end not
one line of writing not a pen or pencil mark
and the markers had been ripped carefully
from every garment on board a gold
watch tied with a rawhide thong in the
trousers had the numbers scratched off
case and works but there was a picture of a
girl in the hunting case face cover-and
when rillard looked at it he gasped with
amazement
the way of the mississippi



  why-dona-its your picture he
cried

  what she exclaimed and examined
the picture it was a profile taken with a
small camera showing her from her trim
waist to her head with a background of
river bank out of focus

   why  never saw that picture before
she cried and her mother verified her state-
ment neither one could remember when it
was taken but there was a comer of a cabin
visible just beyond her and behind her
studying this they determined at last that
the picture had been taken on board a
shanty boat on the yellowstone river about
twro years previous but it was a local boat
on skids up the bank and belonged to a
trapper and his wife other people had
been around there but not this derelict
boat

   some gambler-and he came down mis-
souri into old mississip dona mused  i
hadnt heard of him-to know him

  thinking the man might come down dur-
ing the next day or two looking for his
boat they waited several days and then
they read in a memphis newspaper that a
man had been found drowned on president
island towhead he was dressed in a
nightgown only and there was no clew to
his identity except that he was five feet
eight inches tall weighed about one hun-
dred and sixty-five pounds had dark hair
brown eyes and dark complexion with a
brown mustache

   findings is keepings then dona re-
marked wryly and they divided the money
splitting it three ways rillard took the
watch a beautiful instrument that must
have cost upward of two hundred dollars
and the two women took the boat and its
contents as fair an exchange as could be
made for it would on sale sell for about
as much as the watch

  at helena they sold the boat for one hun-
dred and sixty dollars cash with everything
on board except the firearms and ammuni-
tion thus closed a river incident with the
marks of a typical mississippi grimness
but the inside of the watch cover gave to
rillard a new slant on the river ways he
had not thought of possessing a picture of
dona voane the picture however caught

and held his attention and as he tripped
down the current with his motor boat along-
side the long house boat he looked at the
picture so much that he forgot that he was
responsible for the safe guidance of the two
craft-and a sudden cry brought him back
to his senses just too late

  they were floating down the long red
town bend when the current swung them
whirling into the caving bank and there a
huge sawyer jumping with all the power of
a log in a white-water cascade came up
beneath the big house boat struck the bot-
tom with the force of an explosion and
smashed it up tore up through the stringers
and the cabin floor and a long jagged root
pierced the very roof itself

  just that way things happen down the
mississippi a little day dreaming a bit of
neglect a moment of delicious peace and
lovely floating is changed into one of trag-
edy or dire peril no sooner had the saw-
yer a tree snag more than a hundred feet
long sprang up through the house boat
than it swung down again tearing out the
floor and bottom for fifteen or twenty feet
and disappearing in the water depths before
the flood fairly poured into the hull and
cabin

  mrs voane had been sitting in the cabin
peeling potatoes she was not seen after
her daughter turned to cover the bottom of
a frying pan with squirrel meat at the
crash dona saw the snag clutching at her
but threw herself to the stern and with
a scream sprang to the deck of the jungle
rillards motor boat then seeing the
house boat sinking she cast off the line
that held the jungles stern and bounded
forward and cast off the bow line before
rillard had moved in his paralysis of as-
tounded horror

  the motor boat swung clear bow up-
stream and the house boat sank into the
depths a few splintered boards a little sec-
tion of the roof a few bits of stove wood
floated up out of the water but that was
all the heavy kitchen range the big cabin
heater the anchors traps and perhaps a
ton or two of junk distributed around the
shanty boat sank it to the bottom perhaps
in a hundred feet of water

  dona fainted on the motor boat cabin

rillard stumbled over it to her side and
crying in his remorse at the penalty of his
carelessness stooped over her and tried to
revive her

chapter vii

the river does to men

two days after becoming acquainted
with one another toskin and maiton
landed in the free bend eddy and
convinced jim taken and date lmsal that
neither was a ghost and that the murder
boat was harmless as yet at least never-
theless none of the river pirates would ven-
ture on board the craft and were for a time
doubtful about welcoming maiton and tos-
kin on their own shaggy questionable and
faded launches and shanties

   shortly they were going over the affairs
of the river and maiton heard that rillard
was coming down with the voanes the
fact made him snarl with anger an up-the-
bank softpaw had fouled him that was
his viewpoint and he promised to shoot the
man on sight-no boast but a promise

  to make sure he began to shoot often
with a revolver and an automatic taking
marks as they came in lonely bends and
over sand bars he had long practiced with
firearms and he remarked on the value of
practice as exemplified by the work of dona
voane with her weapons dona had shown
her skill often enough for the river people
to know that she could if she dared shoot
with accurate menace

   shucks  maiton had said to the evi-
dence of his own eyes  shed neveh shoot
a man-a woman d be afeared to shoot a
man dona shoot me not in a thousand
years

  jim taken ventured to offer a tentative
warning against his easy confidence in his
belief to this mad tom made angry re-
tort and the pal subsided they all talked
freely before toskin and having learned
what he was down the mississippi to do
they took delight in having him draw
sketches of them some posed and many as
natural and easy as their habit at the
steering wheel or sweep of a launch or scow

there they were six as bad and mean

rascals as the river afforded taking him in

with them knowing that he was honest-
but a good fellow glad to accommodate him
with their looks and gestures willing that
he should sketch them when they knew it
or not one thing they emphatically re-
fused however was to let him take their
photographs he could sketch them in de-
tail and all together as they were leaning
over their tables in thieving scheme or
debonair in wild fowl hunting-but they
shied from photographs which would serve
to advertise their characteristics should any
detective or police force know the need
of capturing them

  but they enjoyed the photographs he
took of other shanty boats of other river
people of detail and general river scenery
snag sand bar or lumping bank in his
river studies he found the river rats of irre-
placable value as advisers for they showed
him the niceties of river features the white
streak of a fishermans new jump line on
a snag the oar pinheads of shanty boats
the service of a long handy line in throwing
youngs big storeboat out of the main cur-
rent into an eddy the old-fashioned stem
oar the pretty work of a tripper who used
an outboard motor to drive his shanty boat
from the dead water of an eddy out into
the running channel every one of these
suggestions which they made rang true with
the completeness of their piratical river
knowledge and toskin ended each day with
his questionable friends a dead-tired man
but with his brain full of data which his
subconsciousness working all night had
hardly time to sort file away and tabulate
for future reference

  for one thing he trusted to his eyes and
ears not his tongue to satisfy his curiosity
if he spoke it was never with a question on
his lips-he talked of all affairs hut those
of his associates for this reason as well
as for his remarkable indifference to spectral
possibilities in his shanty boat he was wel-
come to the men about him he quite won
the hearts of the two terrible women who
cared for the piratical craft the cooking
and cleaning and often the navigating while
the men attended to their sundry affairs

  it seemed to toskin that he had never in
his life seen such female humans their
the way of the mississippi



faces had lost all trace of sex and were
wrinkled fixed of expression and sullen of
countenance when they spoke it was with
the vibrant tang of frogs low grunting and
ventriloquial finding toskin a willing lis-
tener they told him when the men were not
near stories of their own lives on the rivers
from above pittsburgh to fort benton
from shreveport to away up the yazoo
from down chaffelli to the dark comers of
the arkansaw and st francis

  he sketched them to their delight for
somehow he was able to give their hard
sullen faces a certain expression the source
of which he did not know himself his pen-
cil chalk and even his oils laid over the
sketched outlines on a canvas all displayed
that something which he studied to learn its
meaning-and one day when he sketched a
snag from a photograph which he had taken
he saw a likeness a vanishing line of ripple
below the snag that trailed away in an odd
convoluting twisting incurving it was like
the long pitifully thin rat tail of braided
hair down the back of comanche as one of
the women was called

  with that startling hint toskin made
studies of the women with his little vest-
pocket camera risking their wrath if they
should discover his efforts but knowing
that none of them save mad tom would
visit his own boat because of the murder
on it

  and thus toskin with a reading glass
ransacked the profiles and full faces of the
women till he knew that their faces were
not as he had at first supposed devoid of all
but sullen expression they were crinkled
and wrinkled sun-tanned and wind-creased
squinted by bright light and dark night
tripping and curved with an odd humor
toughened by an age of indifference to all
pangs but those of chill and hunger he
marveled at what he was discovering and
taking one of the profiles that of caprice-
what a name-he patiently plucked out of
sketch and photograph tiny and nearly hid-
den lines and flickers of faintest expression
putting them on a card with water colors

  working with tiny details bent only on
catching those elusive lines and areas so
small that on the camera prints they were
nearly microscopic in size he hardly noticed

what result in toto he was obtaining then
happening to look at the portrait from a
little distance all the fine touches and tiny
copied strokes blended into one and be
stood amazed by the thing that he had done
-the portrait of a young beautiful and
wise-far too knowing-young woman

  why gracious he cried to himself
 what have i done

  that was caprice-a woman of one
name a pirate drudge and a bent-down
river woman he sat back and looked at the
portrait for an hour it was this that his
artistic second sight had seen and com-
pelled him by minute and painful toil to
steal from all his collection of note pictures
and sketch lines he wondered if his eyes
had played him false he could hardly
believe that any such person was mingled
with all the other characters in that old and
squudgy woman

  without comment he held it up in a little
drift pile wood frame and the pirates and
women looked at it from their dinner table
to which he was late in coming for a
minute they gazed and then a ribald grin
stole across the features of mad tom jim
taken shrugged his shoulders and made a
sneering remark comanche straightened up
and uttered a cry of astonished recognition

   why caprice-

  caprice stood half erect and leaned with
heavy-jowled face to see with eyes growing
a bit dim stared for a full minute up and
down and across that picture as she scru-
tinized it her face softened and the blank
toughness seemed to recede leaving a better
rounded face

   sho shom she said and then throwing
up her hands turned and waddled down
the cabin and into the narrow little state-
room of the main craft of the little pirate
fleet bellowing aloud with an emphasis that
must have been comic had it not been the
wail of a heartbroken old hag who had rec-
ognized a picture of the girl that she had
once been

  toskin as long as he lived would re-
member that womans sudden realization of
her life at the same time he could never
again look into a human countenance with-
out divining from its hidden lines of spiritual
growth or moral decay secrets that must

disturb his own satisfaction in human com-
panionship for old mississip had lavished
on him a faculty a power and a curse of
understanding the inspiration of discovering
the endurance of humanity through trifling
with virtue and taking as serious the minor
things of life

   mad tom next of toskins studies dis-
played another phase caprice had been
willful and had chosen that name in the
days when it meant something besides a
river past mad tom little by little gave to
toskin the more pitiful fact of his physical
weakness his mental lack of balance his
heart always sore with disappointment be-
cause nature had given him a bit of pride in
looking well-and he was a horrid little
wretch in his desperation and indignation
against his own fate he had stormed off
down the mississippi become crook crim-
inal scoundrel and brute creator of
wretched violence

   toskin knew better than to show him or
anyof his the picture that revealed the
hopeful and unconscious youth-too weak
too ignorant too mean-souled too con-
temptible ever to become anything remark-
able to gratify his pride yet always endur-
ing the wish and crumbling under the de-
sire a homely little nobody with an appetite
for bigger things and tom maiton had
raged and strived and grown reckless-and
down old mississip he had found a leader-
ship among the miserable of his own type
and gained a notoriety that helped him
evade the pain of his lack of fame a good
little boy a true youth a cringing brow-
beaten little man-till that day he fell upon
a bigger handsome fine-favored youth and
cut his heart out because of a girls sneer
and cruel contempt the analytical por-
trait and the old womens gossip gave tos-
kin the truth-to use when he should if
ever be permitted to paint his way with
inspired discoveries

 but as he discovered his new powers
toskin felt in his soul the terrible dread
that he should never be able to draw what
he saw with his minds eye cultured critics
could never overcome their repugnance
against the crude color and the careless
sweep of his brush-that fear smote him
and toskin spent a sleepless night of fore-

boding wretched because probably by the
time he was through with his best work
he would still be one of the host and horde
of-say the undiscovered disillusioned and
disappointed

   really he was never so confident as when
he was asking himself the question of
whether his life was worth living or not he
was among low and degraded people he
was living in a kind of squalor amid a dark-
ness of moral obloquy he listened with-
out a qualm to schemes of robbing commis-
saries-stores-up the bank he heard mad
tom tell about a bank he knew with mil-
lions in its vaults guarded by a lock that
would succumb to a little soup if only the
night marshal could be rendered helpless
really too toskin was particeps criminis
to the extent that he ate delicious beef
pork chickens and a dozen vegetable pro-
ducts he knew the animals were killed in
the brakes the chickens snatched from their
roosts the vegetables filched-and yet he
ate with good appetite

    wthats the river doing to me he won-
dered

  old mississip was doing to him apace
and opening the channel wide for undream-
able things a nice innocent ambitious
and competent artist with some few refined
and cultured feelings left despite his sev-
eral weeks down old mississip he sat in the
river pirate council pencil and sketch pad
in hand hardly conscious of what his ears
recorded he was so engrossed in fixing with
lead the flashes and contortions of the faces
before him

  mad tom had picked up a bit of news
he was indignant clear through his weeks
of talk had been to cheer his own sadness
but now he was desperate

   dona voanes drappin down the mis-
sissip with dent rillard mad tom said

 the voane boats tore up they claim
mrs voanes done drowned-an boys
rillard caint marry that gal no suh
hes a scoundrel hissef they didnt stop

-he aint got no seventeen dollars n fifty
cent vorce an that gals-gals-boys i
lost my fustest gal count of a hansome
city-bred scoundrel an i cut hisn heart
out donad married me if he hadnt come
along you know how tis
the way of the mississippi



  his voice broke into a whine the shrill
shivering whistling whine of a whipped man
of the world one conscious of his own in-
feriority in every way and mad with anger
because he had nothing in him with which
to build up a personal competence in phy-
sical equality-what he might have done
carefully trained given a real rather than
a common school education none need try
to surmise toskin reflected

    im goin to kill that scoundrel rillard
he caught me foul an sprised me wunst 
mad tom said hoarsely  now hits my
turn-wunst for all wunst for all

  his turn at last-time for him to stand
up with hisweapons against another man
with his and exercising the guile and be-
guilements available to an undersized
crooked and stunted river rat

  toskin knowing only river rats on the
river speculated on this projected crime of
murder to recover a woman somehow the
talk that must have amazed and alarmed
him in any of his old haunts back home
seemed here to be perfecuv natural-and
certainly none of his business-till he was
asleep alone on his own boat mad tom
having joined his river pals on theirs

   then he saw himself in the light of his old
standards of morality justice and standard
laws and when the following day lurking
hidden in the brush of half moon lake
island he saw the jungle denton rillards
boat go floating down and heard mad tom
chortling with angry delight at the near
prospect of doing murder he thought that
he could not permit this crime he must
in some way prevent it and when after
dark the pirates and he went floating down-
stream looking for the sports landing in
eddy or against bank he planned to give
rillard fair warning

  somehow in the river gloom spurts of
current separated the little fleet or perhaps
the pirates just decided to be shut of their
softpaw associates for the time being tos-
kin was carried down close to a caving bank
fought the current and was suddenly
swirled into an eddy only a rod wide and
three or four rods long he threw a line
over a caved-down snag deciding to wait
for morning before venturing out into the
swift sawing current

   he turned in to sleep the rest of the night
he was awakened by the hail of a huntress
in the morning she had been hunting for
she carried a wild gobbler

   howdy on board theh she hailed

  looking out he saw a very comely a very
attractive young woman looking down at
him

   did yo see mad tom or hisns fleet
lately

   why they went down last night-i lost
them-

   lost you oh yes youre that paint-
ing and drawing fellow i heard tell of you
-ves you say they went on down

   yes-

   how far

   why all night unless they found-
um-m-

   oh thank you i know-youre a soft-
paw better let me help you out of this
eddy with your boat-you might be tore
up on some snags just below i lost my
boat-and my mother -she choked a little
- in a bend like this

   she came down cast off the lines and took
the sweeps and toskin from in the cabin
with his camera stole picture after picture
of this lithe and splendid figure as she swaing
the little shanty boat out into the current
and with beautiful strokes carried it clear of
the eddy edges and the swishing pounding
sawyers of trees that had caved off the
wooded bank along that bend

  she took him down into montgomery
chute and around the bend by arkansaw
new mouth where the arkansaw flows with
the waters of white river landed him
alongside the jungle

  mr rillard she called here is
mr toskin the artist thats been with mad
toms pirates theyre looking for us just
as weve heard theyll do murder-mad
tom will i caint let yo-all be killed on
my account

  rillard stood in the engine pit of his
cruiser and looked at toskin with the tall
handsome self-confident aloofness of a suc-
cessful business man who is contemplating
a dreaming genius

   so you are mr toskin rillard
smiled  havent i heard of you-some-
where
argosy-allstory weekly

    yes sir x think perhaps yes sir-
toskin hesitated  you see-partly-you
helped pay for ray art course

   eh-what how was that oh
unvm-

    advertisements for your products-

    thats so-ive been wondering well-
well the world is small isnt it um-m-
yes 

   rillard gave an alarmed glance in the di-
 rection of dona voane and then an equally
 sidelong glance at toskin-a glance the
 artist treasured long afterward though at
 the moment he was far from pleased and
 was asking himself a number of questions
 without showing his thoughts in his blank
 expression

    miss voanes boat was sunk by a saw-
yer just below helena rillard said by
way of explaining  her mother lost her
life and she escaped by a very narrow mar-
gin it was my fault i was a fool-

   as he looked across the river biting his
 lower lip toskin saw that dona regarded
 him with an expression of utter contempt
 though she veiled her expression on the in-
 stant whatever might be in rillards
 mind dona utterly despised him and tos-
 kin wondered at the exultant leap in his
 own heart that this was true

    thats the murder boat isnt it dona
 inquired  seen any ghosts

   toskin admitted his night of panic and
described the coming of mad tom like a
water-logged spirit out of the river eddy
dona smiled and rillard nodded with sat-
isfaction

    one of colonel sibleys people said you
 were up there and probably couldnt get
 out dona explained as they all three ate
 breakfast together on the motor boat
  and we wanted to know about mad tom
 hes been talking all the way down about
 killing mr rillard here

    probably hell stop in at the mouth of
 old arkansaw toskin suggested  he
 said youd always stop there a while miss
 voane

    not this trip im going to arkansaw
city ive friends in the eddy there and
money  come from-from our property
mother and i held it in joint accounts so if
one-one passed out-the other could draw

it you never know what  happen on old

 mississip

    you can take my boat toskin sug-
gested in an aside wondering at his pre-
science  ill wait at arkansaw city

 lawsy-white man she whispered
 howd you know what was in my heart

chapter viii

they walk in river night

dona voane went afloat in the mur-
der boat toskin remained on the
jungle rillard watched her depar-
ture with eyes whose light changed to dark-
ness and dona hardly glanced at him at
all she held the beautifully balanced
sweeps of the little shanty boat dropping
down white river current into the mis-
sissippi her thoughts entirely on toskin
who had loaned her his boat

   that had been such an honorable thing
to do it showed his fine feeling his un-
derstanding of the predicament that had
compelled her to float down the river with
the bungling and proud-thoughted rillard
rillard had said many things that made
dona despise him more and more

   he had been glad that the river people
were so isolated and she had found some
amusement in his confidence that his river
experience was so sure to be buried in the
oblivion of river tradition the river she
knew would protect its own but when some
sport tripped down and sought to take ad-
vantage of the rivers characteristics-well
old mississip would change them for the
occasion

   toskin however was different he fitted
 in she could see why the pirates had trust-
 ed him-he was gifted with tact and the
 river etiquette just naturally laid its law
 down for him and he obeyed who but a
 natural born river man would have instant-
 ly offered her his own shanty boat to re-
 lieve her of the equivocal posidon she
 seemed to occupy floating down in the
 four state-roomed large-cabined well-found
 jungle

   she made her escape from that predica-
 ment immediately and dropped down to
 mozart bend to land in for he night with
the way of the mississippi



her old friend mrs forbes who owned the
great horseshoe of river holding it against
all comers and five of whose seven hus-
bands were buried up the bank all in a
row mrs forbes came down running but
as she stared at the shanty boat she drew
nervously back

   what boats that what boats that
dona she cried in a shrill voice

   a man name of toskin lent me hit ac-
count of ourn tearin up-mothers daid
 so i hearn-por gal lawsy how
come hit

   hit were a fool scoundrel a sport name
of rillard he was sittin into his boat
pilot house the jungle-we drapped down
red town bend-an yo know what tis
the sawyers an snags along that cavin
bank down we drapped-up a sawyer
jumped lawsy-lawsy

  dona sobbed and the little red-haired
river woman put her arm around the dis-
consolate girl they went up to mrs
forbess small red shanty boat on its skids
and dona finished her narrative

dona blushed as she realized the signifi-
cance of what she had said

    hit were jes friendly sos i neednt
to stay on the jungle any more i took hit
-at arkansaw city of course i kin draw
money an outfit again-

  despite mrs forbess objections dona
went down on board the boat to sleep that
night it was a late hour for mrs forbes
and she had had many things to talk over
going up the pretty plank gangway serv-
ing as a spar to hold the bow off the bank
she hauled taut the port bow line which
was slack and felt the stern line and found
it run out in good water in the eddy en-
tering the cabin she locked both doors and
sat down in the lamp light and felt the
loneliness of her life now

  her mother had gone utterly out of her
life like the light of a candle she was
alone in the world but self-reliant that
wasnt it the companionship had been
sufficient they had enjoyed the river liv-
ing they had braved its jeopardies and
they had lived on after her father had mys-
teriously disappeared as men do she was
sure he was dead and she suspected it had
been murder done by mad tom or his
pirates to force her to be his wife then
rillards unpardonable negligence had be-
reaved her in her heart she hated him
almost equal to her hate for mad tom

  now toskin loomed in her young free
mind he had brought first ot all under-
standing to the river knowing the mur-
der boat for what it was he had dared it
with true courage-a thousand miles of
river was talking about toskins  wrestling
with the spirits

  in the quiet in the gloom she heard
them now they were walking this night
rillard fool up-the-banker that he was
had heard them in his mean way and they
had inspired him to his-she laughed-silly
kiss with its prompt punishment by the
coming of mad tom real permissible
kisses arent interrupted down old missis-
sip her chuckle faded into a vague and
irresistible regret

   old mississip had never permitted her to

 have a real lover one who was respectable
 she was quite willing but none had come
 along toskin had befriended her thinking
 of him she listened to the river and heard
 the murmuring of the ripples and the un-
 dertone of the mighty flood

   listening she began to hear other sounds
 not meant for her ears she heard voices
 and knew them to be the marching host that
 so often parades up and down the mid-cur-
 rent a motley throng and among them in
 her minds ears she heard a familiar voice

   trembling reluctant unable to resist the
 impulse she put out the light and opened
 wide the window curtain pulled aside the
 slide window and looked over the stern at
 the sweep of the river horseshe bend it
 avas a grand night scene-a few of the
 brighter stars shone faintly through the
 thick air and the river surface from shore
 to shore was glowing with rippling radi-
 ance

   there the girls true eyes saw the host
 as never before she saw the throng of spec-
 tral people strolling up and down some in
 their quaint old customs some in indian
 raiment some recent and not yet old-fash-
 ioned she saw among them as plainly as
 though she were but a hundred yards dis-
 tance her mother

    i dont believe it i dont believe it
 dona whispered to herself  oh-mother
 -is it you

   the figure stopped and turned to look
it was mrs voane she was a beautiful
woman her eyes were full of luster and
they were seeing eyes she gave dona a
perfectly eloquent look turned and saw
some one coming through the throng and
walked to meet him

   it was her father voane was dead he
was coming crowding his way through the
press of people but careful of the little
children who played-children of indians
of french of spanish of pioneers of shanty
boat ark steamboat people-in his way
he came to her mother and the two
embraced for an instant dona was hurt
and bewildered-then the two turned and
looked at her for a long time they looked
across that eddy and the daughter read in
their eyes the things they were thinking
they were loving her-they were smiling at

 her with understanding-they were infinite-
 ly kind and comprehending

   they stood there while the others walked
 up and down beyond them one of the
 strollers came swaggering along and dona
 recognized him as he came to her parents
 he was a handsome youngish kind of man
 -bold and laughing in his careless way
 now she saw him look at her his eyes twin-
 kling-and as he pointed to her and the
 boat she shivered with apprehension which
 quickly ceased however

   she was on board his boat-clell wil-
 mondss boat he was the man who had
 built it owned it tripped the river in it and
 been murdered in it the three talked to-
 gether and after a time each looking at her
 in their own ways they strolled together
 into the throng and eddying in it visible
 for a long time as they went on and on
 greeting old acquaintances and strange peo-
 ple they at last passed out of sight

   then the shades glimmered and grew in-
 distinct there was something to be seen
 and dona strained her eyes trying to see
 more distinctly but the spectral proces-
 sion mingled and melted away the river
 was vacant from shore to shore she saw
 the trees on yon side and the sand bar
 point she saw the sand bar up the river
 the crossing down thf river

   she heard birds singing and started up
 with astonishment over the trees across
 the river to the east were rays of sunshine
 and the twigs of the forest gleamed and
 shone with reflections on the dew it was
 dawn-daybreak had come apace

    dona started to her feet tears of gratitude
 flowing down her cheeks no one in the
 up-the-bank world would ever believe that
 she had seen what had passed before her
 eyes least of all would they believe that her
 father and mother had been united in that
 vast throng before her very eyes but in
 her heart was such comfort as she had not
 known since that long wait for the return of
 her father had begun

   she knew he was dead her mother was
 dead she alone remained of the voanes
 she was surprised to find in her hand a
 banjo which she had not seen-she was
 picking it picking it gayly and the music
 was what had started the birds a-singing

                         	a
the way of the mississippi



  why its my banjo what was stoled
she gasped

   dona dona voane a shrill voice
hailed down the river bank  my lawse
i lowed yod gone plumb crazy

  it was mrs forbes mrs forbes added
the rest to the story of that night

   gal-gal hits yo makin that music
i hearn hit an i heam hit-why i lowed

man cackled and chuckled with relief

   why she said  id a bet yo was jes

years ago i neveh heam such music then

don yo wear yosef out be ready when

jay er an oriole

  oh i shall dona laughed lightly
and picked a dozen bars on the great banjo

  then she went up to eat breakfast with
mrs forbes

   you wouldnt blieve what ive seen out
theh mrs forbes said in awe

 you good dear dona exclaimed
 im a river girl id believe anything you
ever told me about it

  mrs forbes laughed but her eyes were

   	a

charged with awe as she looked out across
old mississip sparkling and dancing in the
sunshine as the flood poured along after
breakfast dona drifted away down the river
toward arkansaw city

  she experienced little difficulty in assum-
ing charge of her own affairs the joint
ownership which she and her mother had
taken of the property permitted her to draw
checks buy or sell and control the for-
tune this done she tripped away down
the river her heart singing and keeping
tune to it with her banjo and her voice

  she was happy she was sure she trusted
herself to old mississip like a babe trusts
itself to its mother also she kept her pistol
loaded and practiced with the guns that
toskin had left on board

  she waited now to see what old missis-
sip would do next-and she laughed to the
rivers smile happy in her brave heart and
rejoicing in her knowledge

  whats a-comin she asked just
a singsong to dance to

chapter ix

the craven lurks

mad tom and his fellows in their dull-
shaded pirate craft floated down
scrub grass bend and as the river
current carried them wandering a touch of
a sweep enabled them to lose toskin the
pleasant up-the-banker in the gray gloom
they wanted no casual witnesses now
passing montgomery chute they debated
whether or not rillard would run up into
white river and through arkansaw new
mouth by the cut off

   he wouldnt mad tom declared
 softpaws dont play no riveh tricks like
that besides i dont expect donad stand
fo hit

  accordingly they dropped on down to-
ward old mouth where they would find
people of whom to make discreet or con-
fidential inquiries mad tom was snarling
with anger against rillard dona voane
would stand no nonsense from any man but
probably rillard knew that he must know
it she hadnt killed him so it stood to
reason he was plumb sensible


argosy-allstory weekly

    likely hell get one of them seventeen
 dollar n fifty cent vorces mad tom
 whined to himself  an probbly account
 of him being a big feller an rich an re-
 spectable an all them kind of things shell
 marry im dona always did set a heap of
 store by men bein decent aint women
 the limit

   memory of his attack on rillard was sunk
 deep in mad toms consciousness he was
 afraid a fact that steadily made him cringe
 while he hated the back of his neck still
 twitched and hurt where the big mans
 thumbing had so carelessly half paralyzed
 the river rat while hoisting him over the
 stern bumper of the concert boat to toss
 him like a mongrel dog into the gray mid-
 night eddy

   the ease with which the strong and com-
 petent man had done it was a dead weight
 of dread on the river rats heart even
 thought of trickery from bushwhacking ad-
 vantage made him tremble at the chance of
 a trip-up the river rat shuddered as he
 realized that the man he hated through
 sheer competence would have an even
 chance against any kind of treachery
 courage walks with justified pride on a
 broad highway along the double barriers of
 hidden skulking cravens and each coward
 knows the confidence is with reason war-
 ranted by the difference between a good
 man and a mean scoundrel

   mad tom feared the outcome yet he pur-
 sued his intention the pirates ran down
 the bank slicked their way into old river
 mouth in a night mist and like cats tool
 their landings separated by time and space
 that chance observers might not know they
 had any interests in common thus they
 appeared among the dwellers of the shanty
 boat community listening to what people
 said about one another

   jim taken heard all about mad toms
 coming down the river trying to court
 dona voane every one was talking about
 it he passed the word to mad tom who
 snarled at the exposure of his real feelings
 like a worm on a concrete sidewalk in the
 sun the jungle rillards motor boat did
 not appear mad tom was perturbed the
 powerful craft could easily turn to stem the
 current back to helena or memphis

   id ought a thought of that he
 swore

   then a fisherman who had been to ar-
 kansaw city brought up word that he had
 met dona voane dropping down in the
 mendova murder boat

    she was smilin-happy the fisherman
 declared to mad toms sharp questioning
  singing an playin her banjo-

    anybody with her on that boat

    i didnt get to see the fisherman
 shook his head nervously

    why the blazes didnt yo look mad
 tom cursed him  you blamed fool-
 i-i was afeared the fisherman re-
 plied  that gal don stan no nonsense
 from any man

   mad tom threw himself in his temper
 and scurried away he rounded up his pals
 and over the table in his boat told them
 what had taken place

     why hits that toskin picture feller
 that scoundrel aint reliable hes treach-
 rous he is lookt how he come hit onto
 we uns he jes drapped out that night
 an foun her an now-now-

   mad om frothed as he thought what
 was the natural sequence of events

    hit werent rillard mad tom de-
 clared dona jes-jes were took stoled
 likely by that smooth-actin picture feller
 an i neveh spected im at all lawse-
 them still fellers-i tell you the on way
 to do gin yo meet a still feller is plug im
 yas suh 

   mad tom cut loose and went on down
 the river dona on toskins boat was be-
 low somewhere on the instant thought of
 rillards fine motor boat dropped from the
 anxious pirates mind comanche and ca-
 price took no part in the proceedings they
 merely served the grub cleaned the boats
 and by grunts or snickers indicated their
 understanding of what they were told to do

   at arkansaw city they landed in one
 boat away up at the head of the three-mile
 eddy the other cruising down the edge of
 the channel current swung in at the foot
 of the eddy and ran over to make fast to the
 great log raft which was spiled and an-
 chored there for the sawmills mad tom
 cast his scowling gaze across the fleet of an-
 chored and moored shanty and motor boats
the way of the mississippi



in the landing but the mendova murder
boat was not there

  in five minutes from the cunis photo-
graph boat he learned that she had laid in
the eddy two nights while the girl trans-
acted business up the bank then she had
swung clear again and dropped down the
river she was alone

  never in his life had mad tom had so
amazing and relieving a reversal of ideas
dona voane had come all clear and honor-
able she was shut of the motor boat up-
the-banker and of that picture-making
harmless kid he took the photographers
word laughed and both boats soon swung
away down the river full tilt

   all i ask now is meetin dona face to
face fair an square down some lonesome
bend mad tom laughed  hi-i i
bet shell marry me plumb grateful-

  it was time to celebrate he knew now
that old mississip was meaning right by
him what more would a man ask cer-
tainly a river pirate asks no better friend
than the river with its night its dark bends
its fogs and its byways mad tom ran into
go-lang island chute where biskos still-
boat did an all-river trade and bisko read-
ily sold the pirates four jugs right out of the
ground where they had been buried better
than two months it was moonshine of tre-
mendous proof in their anxieties and scur-
rying the pirates had missed many oppor-
tunities to liquor up now with everything
propitious they opened a jugful the aroma
of which killed a fly that incautiously
alighted on the top with the cork out

  they served the river-drip in water
glasses yet after a round mad tom
called a halt

   hold on  he ordered  likely we bet-
ter go easy

  it was river instinct for as he turned
to look up the river they saw a motor boat
coming down it drove past nearly half a
mile distant and mad tom recognized it
at a mile easily the jungle had run by
with whatever that might portend the
pirate suitor of dona voane went into a
rage he cursed his own companions blam-
ing them for the stop at biskos river tiger
though he had himself proposed it now
his advantage lost he made haste to over-

take the girl again thus his confidence
and dejection had all his life alternated with
senseless bursts of anger at each change of
mind

  you fools he cursed his people and
piling into his own open launch with spray
hood up and his own bits of property he
deserted them all without explanation or
good-by this was his mood he would
they surmised show up again somewhere
along the line when he needed them he
had taken one of the jugs and as he drove
at full speed he took sip by sip claiming
to stand it when he drank it sensibly as well
as any man

  he ran into the shanty boat colony on
the bank at greenville he soon knew all
he wanted to know all there was to know
dona had tripped past plowing right along
down with an outboard motor over the
stem of the mendova boat the jungle
was two days behind her and a night ahead
of mad tom wtho was dazed by the fact
of the outboard motor on the shanty boat
she could beat the current in that well-
shaped craft by three to five miles an hour
the jungle was a swifter craft by far than
his own launch if the sports went night
and day he was hopelessly lost astern but
knowing sports he suspected they wouldnt
run nights being afraid of the dark in that
river of questionable shadows

  thinking it over he knew what dona
voane wras now doing the death of her
mother made it imperative that she clear
up the questions of the property the
amount of which he could only guess the
fortune was considerable dating back
through years of river saving and river
trade those voane women always had
known how to take care of what they
owned a fact that in no way detracted from
doanas charm

  fortune favored him well as he supposed
a brisk south wind sprang up tossing waves
against the current and throwing his launch
about the shanty boat could make no
headway against that storm no river wo-
man would want to ride in such a gale
and as he kept on plowing down driving in
the current in long lonely and wild lake
providence reach he saw across a sand bar
the familiar outline of the mendova boat


argosy-allstory weekly

it was in two-way chute and just out-
side anchored in deep water was the jungle

  mad tom cursed as he laughed and
swung wide to land at the head of willow
bank to lie in wait for the coming of dusk
luck favoring a man plays pretty tricks
and mad tom realized that he was able at
last to clean up on this whole matter

   he could see that probably rillard and
toskin were being polite as they played
their hands that was their game which
must make dona laugh he would show
them he would show her too and when
night at last fell he knew all there was
needful for him to know for from the wil-
lows he had watched the boats

   all three had taken advantage of the gale
to hunt wild geese on the outside bars
dona had taken them over the sand and
they had spread out on quacking towhead
hiding in pits dug in the switch willows
the geese were coming down as though they
expected the wind to change into a cold
northern storm from his hiding place
mad tom saw the hunters drop nine geese
of which dona in the middle blind killed
five rillard two and toskin two

   the hunters didnt wait for the night
flight but strolled together with the bird
wings flapping in the gale as they walked
around the south side of the bar keeping
out of the sand clouds running upwind
dona would roast a goose and she would
serve it with nobody but two up-the-bank-
ers to appreciate it

   after dark he dropped silently down the
stem chute to two-way keeping close by
the caving sand bar on the west side where
the current was gnawing the island even
night has its shadows on the river and
mad tom ever sought the darkest

   he had no plan he had merely rage and
desire to urge him on rillard toskin and
dona with their boats were now in a deso-
lation of river back water with luck still
favoring him he would be shut of the two
men and dona admiring his prowess as
well as overwhelmed by his cunning master-
fulness would be his prize she and her
mother had been rich and nowr their money
would be his too

    sho he whispered  i wont have to
work er take chances any more

   they were on board the shanty boat
 the south wind blew the odor of the baked
 goose up the chute to smite his nostrils he
 was jealous of those two men eating that
 delicious meat he threw out a light mud-
 hook and swung his launch up tight against
 the low sand bank a hundred yards from
 the cabin boat

   he ran his hands over his shotgun rifle
 and pistol holsters wondering on which to
 depend finally he took the shotgun to
 crawl up on the bank and work his way
 down the sand through the thick growth of
 switch willows to where he could listen in
 on the merriment

   keen as were his ears few words and no
 sentences reached his interpretative facul-
 ties he could not tell what they were talk-
 ing about he knew in his heart however
 that every advantage was his the skiff of
 the two visitors was drawn up on the sand
 just below the shanty boat the two would
 come out of the front door and walk down
 the sand ten yards to their craft when on
 their way to the jungle

    then ill get im he chuckled to him-
 self

   he opened his shotgun to make sure there
 were shells in it those shells contained
 twelve buckshot each and there were five
 shells in the weapon what two scoundrels
 could escape a fusillade of sixty lead bullets
 the size of peas mad tom knew it couldnt
 be done

    i mustnt hit her he assured himself
  shed be mad if i wounded her she sure
 would

   he shook his head remarking

    a riveh lady neveh does stand fo any
 gittin shot herself 

   accordingly he allowed to be perfectly
 sure that the girl was all clear of the shot
 before he opened on the two men

    shell be plumb proud havin that big
 motor cruiser fo a honeymoonin he
 mused shucks that man rillards no
 count-

   the river rat hesitated lowering his eyes
 the twinge was still in the back of his neck
 where rillard had gripped and thumbed
 him for that insult for the ducking for
 all that had happened rillard deserved to
 die and must toskin was no count and
the way of the mississippi



treacherous taking up with dona voane
after knowing all about mad toms intend-
ing to marry her honorable the lurker
hoped the two wouldnt have a falling out
with each other the way men do sometimes
playing for a girl thataway

   i want to take cyar of the both of
em mad tom clicked his teeth i
want to ferget the looks of that las feller
i killed-lawse how them faces do come
back hits dark an to-night i caint see
no faces-i caint see how they look

  how long he was there mad tom could
not tell time drags yet the anticipated
moment arrives before its time in such a
place he heard the diners suddenly start
from their chairs he heard an exclama-
tion he heard laughter and then the front
door of the cabin boat was suddenly thrown
wide open as he glared his hands grasping
his shotgun

chapter x

an old mans kiss

denton rillard was shocked im-
measurably to find that even down
on old mississip he could meet one
of his own people this toskin had shown
a lot of good sense working on advertise-
ments his ambition had been for special
studies and the advertisements had paid
his way probably he was living on ril-
lards money now the thing was ridicu-
lous but as he thought about the matter
rillard say how easy it had been that he
should meet the young man down the mis-
sissippi away back yonder rillard had
felt the subtle appeal of wide-flowing waters
as indicated by toskins real art in back-
grounds of the products display type

  the elder adventuring man felt a pang
as he realized that he was now old that he
had no business no excuse for this flight
of his into the romantic sequences of youth
and recklessness long since his own life
had shaped its course

   im a fool he whispered in his heart
 even in my temptation i called the girl
corilla lord im a fool

  he glared into the opaque waters of old
mississip and heard the coiling eddies

chuckle as they flowed along he thought
at first to blame the river for his own slip-
ping on second thought he saw the truth
the river had brought young jerald toskin
down for the girl to find and bring to mont-
gomery chute and the boy a mere strip-
ling of twenty odd and of the girls own age
had given her his boat gentleman that he
was to relieve her in the embarrassing pre-
dicament in which the loss of her mother
destruction of her boat and his own posi-
tion as host had left her

  there was a pang in his heart he was
old gray was in his hair with youth he
could not now compete he knew how kind
the river had been to him when it granted
him that pretty kiss at a moment when he
was lonely but how quickly mad tom had
come to remind him of his folly

  he was sure the girl laughed at him
what did a kiss mean to so young a person
anyhow she just plagued him with mock-
ery but the girl was not plaguing toskin
her eyes had been all for the youth well
they ought to be in his day rillard had
been specially favored his smile changed
as he thought of corilla lordy but there
had been a girl in her day yes indeed
for that matter she was yet

   go on dent his wife had urged him
when his tongue tied up at the thought of
being able to trip down the rivers she knew
him she was probably laughing at the ro-
mantic ideas in his heart knowing them
well

   next time-well go together he said
with sudden puzzlement  sure ill bet
shed go and have as much fun-if id go
about it right

  so there he began to lay plans schem-
ing to make his wife see his light and come
romancing with him somewhere away out
yonder corilla had been a good sport
she was trim and swagger yet she had
seen clear through him and let him have his
fling

  he drew up in a bit of hauteur toward
the old mississip regarding the flood of
muddy gold and all its people with a kind
of scorn and even contempt only to hear
the eddy chuckle and to remember the thrill
of the strange unexpected irresistible kiss
which would lie warm and taunting on his

conscience forever more-a lone monument
on the grave of his temptations

   in his heart he gave over to toskin tak-
ing a bit of self-congratulation as a man
might at his self-abnegation from that
hour he saw the distraught thoughtfulness
of the young man dreaming of the girl
whose river way and feminine beauty had
caught up his heart they went together
down the river rillard playing the skipper
for the lover the old man owed it to the girl
to see that she should be forever cared for
now that on his carelessness rested the tragic
consequence of the river wreck the girl
might never forgive that she ought not to

   at arkansaw city she had left letters for
toskin one mailed the morning of her ar-
rival the other the morning of her depar-
ture he did not show them to rillard
he merely said it was her hurry to see about
her mothers property in vicksburg and
new orleans she couldnt wait yet she
had urged that he follow her

    ill run you down rillard said add-
ing  shes a fine girl toskin shes edu-
cated-and wise too

 i know toskin nodded  but she
dont think much of-of up-the-bankers
 dont let that worry you rillard ex-
claimed  theres one softpaw she thinks
a lot about i know

   you-you think toskin turned won-
deringly

    know the man laughed giving the
motor a bit more gas to gain speed on the
current another mile an hour against the ris-
ing south wind

  thus they ran into lake providence
reach and overtook dona who was trying
to buck the wind but it was too rough even
to tow behind the jungle they ran in on
her suggestion to have a goose hunt and
they sat down to a wonderful goose supper
dona having a great bird which she had
shot the day before

   rillard would have remained clear of the
supper had not dona insisted on his pres-
ence this was the second evening there
by signs the old man knew the youngsters
were agreed he tried mightily to act sur-
prised wrhen dona told him that she and
toskin were going to marry at vicksburg

    fine  he cried  thatsfine 

  the supper eatenclear to the pumpkin
pie rillard said he would be going the
two urged him not to so soon but he smiled

    ill take the tender over he said

    ill come over in her boat toskin de-
clared confidantly

   you might ask me she exclaimed and
all laughed

  rillard opened the door to step out on
the bow platform as the light flashed from
the oil lamp gas burner he blinked out into
the darkness thus illumined over the sand
bar as he did so he saw a greenish-purple
flare straight ahead of him close to the sand
where a log was lying on the ground

  the man knew that flash it was a pair
of eyes he had seen game by fire light
jacked-deer coonspossum andeven a wild-
cats eyes so he knew this was some animal
out there in the darkness of the gale some
look in those eyes startled the man into in-
stant action he felt their menace and he
knew the vacancy of the bar-no legitimate
thing would be thus lying out watching the
shanty boat

  he drew donas revolver from the chey-
enne holster and with the swift leap of long-
practiced boyish play-shooting he leveled
the weapon and on the instant fired it was
instinctive impulse it was too more than
this-the habitual alertness that one comes
to have when old mississip is in a mood to
instruct its children in watchfulness

   as he fired there was the crash and flare
of a gun out there in the night a charge
of shot slammed past them

   ouch rillard exclaimed and dashed
toward the bushwhacker firing as he ran

  dona caught up a rifle from the corner
of the cabin and toskin took it as he too
ran to back up rillard the girl closed the
door

    all right rillard cried as he threw a
flashlight beam on the ground behind the
drift log  i got him

  every advantage had been with mad
tom maiton he had figured it all out
with meticulous care one thing alone had
escaped his attention-was the fact that
his own eyes would flare brightly in the dark
wthen the boat door opened he had waited
to shoot the two men but as he glared the
fire of his eyes had betrayed him
the way of the mississippi



  good lord its a man rillard cried
over and over again and then he added
 ive killed a man ive killed a man
and a good job of it the river girl
choked  he lowed to bushwhack us all
lawse what shooting plumb center in
the haid

   she discovered a trickle of blood on ril-
lards face one of the high-thrown shots
had grazed his scalp parting his hair

  we better pull right out dona ex-
claimed

   no rillard shook his head  i
wont run on a thing like this well have
to find the coroner or sheriff-authorities
 yes thats best  toskin nodded

   probably theyd catch us if we run
too dona added

   in the morning they found the river rats
launch and rillard accompanied by tos-
kin went down to town where they told a
deputy and through him reached the sheriff
and coroner the three and a posse went
up to the scene of the tragedy

   sho  sheriff corton exclaimed  i
know that scoundrel i had him six years
ago when i was deputy for entering and
robbing he broke jail that man needed
killin he did course well inquest im
but i expect hed better ben killed long
since youre shore lucky mr man that
charge of buckshot didnt come three inches
lower- yes indeed 

   the two witnesses testified at the cor-
oners inquest mad tom maiton had tried
to commit crime tried to kill rillard and
meant no good toward either dona or
toskin

   the coroners jury brought in a verdict of
justifiable homicide with which the prose-
cutor concurred rillard trembling and
with tears in his eyes thanked them all old
mississip had overwhelmed him with its
menace he had thought the eyes were a
wildcats when he fired but he let it go that
he had fought a duel with a man-and won

    im leaving the river he told the two
when they were back on their boats
 heres where i quit toskin im leaving
the jungle in your charge i havent any
confidence in that blamed mendova murder
boat im not superstitious but ive had

the

experience you take the jungle-you and
dona here burn that blamed shanty
boat

   yes-but- toskin hesitated glanc-
ing at dona

   well she smiled  we dont have to
go clear to vicksburg-right down below
is lake providence- expect-

  fine rillard declared clear out
that old shanty boat

  they carried the outfit equipment and
other useful things on board the jungle
they gave the furniture to darkies who were
up the bank and even offered them the
shanty boat but they wouldnt have it a
half gallon of kerosene in the cabin and a
wadded up newspaper set on fire thrown
into the splash started the flames the boat
swung down the river and smoking dark
burned itself out within five miles

  in the meanwhile the jungle tripped on
down to lake providence they sparred
off at the eddy below the steamboat ware-
house and went uptown the justice of the
peace was right glad to welcome them he
sure was glad when these shanty boaters
came to town a-marrying according to his
judgment and generally speaking they all
ought to get married personally he was
just plumb glad to commodate couples

  rillard was sure the justice had said it
just the way it ought to be he hesitated
when the bride turned to him expectantly

   i wish you all the happiness in the
world he said kissing her and when he
saw the jungle beyond as they went over
the levee he added  now dona this man
of yours has talent and ability even some
reputation dont you let him waste them
hes an artist you know and he mustnt
be wasted the world needs him-

    ive two half hitches and a line bite on
him she laughed  and when i tie in
tisnt to a willow stake but good ash
well bring the jungle home come spring
when we come well sure know whats
what-

  good luck rillard called throwing
the last line to the girl as the jungle edged
clear of the eddy

  she laughed as she threw him an old
mans kiss

what has occurred in part 

on march q  a strange vehicle capable of traveling through space lands in wyoming
from it emerged a band of inhabitants of mercury bent upon the conquest of the earth
they devastate the surrounding region with a mysterious ray

    alan newland son of a professor who has warned the world of a possible invasion from mer-
cury discovers on an island in a florida river a girl much like those of earth except that she has
wings she too has come from mercury he brings her home meanwhile his friend bob
trevor a reporter has been captured by the invaders in wyoming

chapter viii

the escape

re mercutians all regarded me cu-
riously as we came among them by
the respect they accorded tao and
his attitude toward them i decided he was
the leader of the entire party i stopped
wondering what would happen next the
man guarding me was still close at hand
tao spoke a few words to him and then

moved away my guard immediately sat
down i saw nothing was required of me
at the moment and sat down also

  i had opportunity now to examine the
strange things and people about me more
in detail the mercutians all seemed to
be of the same short squat red-haired type
tao was indeed the only one i saw who
had black hair and he was the tallest
and by far the most commanding looking
figure of them all

this story began in the argosy-allstory weekly for october 


the fire people



  they wore several different costumes al-
though the garment of white fur was the
most common a few were dressed in the
black costume of the guard in the gully
still others were garbed only in short wide
trousers and shirts of a soft leather with
legs bare from the knee down and with
leather buskins on their feet

  the light-ray was set up near the river
on a metallic structure supporting a small
platform some thirty feet above the ground
a ladder up one side gave access to this
platform from below the light itself came
from a cubical metallic box perhaps six
feet square suspended above the platform
in a balancing mechanism that allowed it
to swing in all directions

  all the metal of this apparatus the pro-
jector the platform and its framework was
apparently of the same kind it had the
appearance of burnished copper the whole
seemed fairly complicated but not unlike
a huge searchlight would appear if mounted
that way

  coming out of the projector and running
down to the ground were black wires which
led to a metallic box a few feet away this
box was rectangular in shape six feet long
perhaps two feet broad and the same in
depth i judged it to be the dynamo or
battery from which the projector was sup-
plied with the light-ray

  a short distance back from the river i
saw what appeared to be a small mortar
which i assumed wis for the sending of the
light-rockets or bombs several other light-
ray projectors sections of their supporting
structures and the unassembled parts of
other apparatus were lying scattered about
the ground a considerable number of the
mercutians were laboriously bringing out of
the vehicle still more apparatus

  it was obvious to me then that they were
only just getting started in their offensive
and defensive preparations this i could
easily understand when i had watched for
a moment the activities going on all of
the apparatus which they were engaged in
bringing out and assembling was of metal
and it was so extremely heavy here on
earth that they could hardly handle it

   standing on the platform beside the light-
ray projector were two men evidently in

charge of it at the moment they were
dressed in black with black gloves al-
though without helmets i noticed that
they had little pads over their ears with
wires running from them down to a small
box at the waist

  once i saw one of them look up sharply
as though he had heard something and
following the wave of his hand i saw the
tiny black-garbed figure of a man on the
higher ground behind the gully through
which we had come i reasoned then that
this was a lookout stationed there and that
he was directing the action of the light by
some form of wireless telephony

   for perhaps an hour i sat there with my
guard near by watching me i was sorry
now that i found myself in the midst of
 these enemies that i had not made a de-
termined effort to escape earlier in the day
when there would have been only four of
them to cope with

  i realized that i didnt know any more
now about the power this guard had over
me than i had at the beginning he cer-
tainly looked inoffensive sitting there but
the very calmness with which he watched
me made me feel i would be taking a des-
perate chance in attempting to escape i
decided then to wait until nightfall and to
watch a favorable opportunity to break
away

   under cover of darkness if once i could
get out of their sight i was satisfied they
would never catch me it was my plan to
strike back to garland i had noticed care-
fully the lay of the land coming over and
believed i could find my way back then
with the car or the plane that was there in
the garage i could get back to billings

  these thoughts were running through my
mind when tao abruptly presented himself
before me and ordered me to get up i
did so smiling in as friendly a fashion as
i could manage he then made me assist
in the work of carrying the heavy pieces
of apparatus apparently he was deter-
mined that i as an earth man should work
hard since the mercutians were so heavily
handicapped by the gravity of my planet

i concluded that it would be my best policy
to help them all i could--that by so doing
they might relax a little in their watchful-

i

ness and thus enable me to get away that
night

  i signified to tao my understanding of
what he was after and made them all see
my entire readiness and ability to help for
the rest of the afternoon i was dragging
about from place to place carrying the pro-
jectors to the various positions where they
had decided to put them up it seemed
to be their plan to establish some twenty
or thirty projectors around the vehicle
they were setting them all at points about
a hundred yards away from it these pro-
jectors differed in size and shape some
were cubical others pyramid-shaped open
at the base as though to send out the light
in a spreading ray

  i saw now when i had a chance to in-
spect the projectors closer that they were
black outside and like burnished copper in-
side to reflect the light i judged that this
black covering must have been like the
black suits worn by some of the men and
that it was impervious to the light-ray
near the center of each projector was a
coil of wire the wires from outside ran
to it and across the open face of the pro-
jector a large number of fine lateral wires
ran parallel very close together

  these were about all the details i no-
ticed i wanted to remember them al-
though they conveyed very little to me be-
cause i realized all this i was seeing might
prove of immense help to the authorities
when i got back to billings

  night came and i was still at work
tao seemed tremendously pleased at what
i was doing and i noticed with satisfac-
tion that his attitude toward me seemed
gradually changing my guard still fol-
lowed me about but he did not watch me
quite so closely now i thought

  my help that afternoon was consider-
able i was by far the strongest man in
the camp and more than that i was able
to move about so much faster than they
that i could do things in a few moments
that would have taken them many times as
long

  tao personally directed most of my ef-
forts he told me where to take the things
and i took them smilingly and always
coming back to him for new orders i

moved so fast indeed that my guard had
difficulty in keeping close to me several
times i experimented and found that i could
get away from him quite a little distance
without a protest either from him or from
tao

  as it began to grow dark they lighted
up the camp this was accomplished by
little metallic posts that had been set around
at intervals each had a tiny coil of wire
suspended at its top which became incan-
descent and threw out a reddish-green light
around each light was a square black wire
cage some three feet in diameter i con-
jectured that these lights used the same
ray as the projectors only in a different
form and that the cage was to protect any
one from going too close the light from
these illuminators was much the same in
aspect as the ray except that it seemed
to diffuse itself readily and carried only a
comparatively short distance

  the scene now under this red-green
glare was weird in the extreme the work
all about me went on steadily the mer-
cutians were all dressed in white furry gar-
ments now-i concluded because of the cold
-with the exception of those who had on
the suits and helmets of black

  the reddish-green light made them all
appear like little gnomes at work indeed
the whole scene with its points of color in
the darkness and the huge monstrous shad-
ows all about was more like some fantastic
picture out of a fairy book than a scene on
this earth

   soon after nightfall tao stopped me and
one of his men brought me something to
eat i still had the slices of bread and
meat in my pocket but thinking i might
need them later on i kept them there
tao and i sat down near one of the lights
and ate together we were served by one
of the men my guard still kept close at
hand

  the food was nothing more than hard
pieces of baked dough and a form of sweet
something like chocolate for drink there
was a hot liquid quite comparable to tea
this was served us in small metal cups with
handles that seemed to be insulated from
the heat

  this meal was brought to us from in-
the fire people



side the vehicle while we were eating i
could see many of the mercutians going
inside and coming out with pieces of this
food in their hands eating as they worked
quite obviously the business of assembling
their apparatus was uppermost in the minds
of all of them

  the whole atmosphere about the place
i realized now in spite of the opposite ef-
fect their dragging footsteps gave was one
of feverish activity when we had eaten
tao seemed willing to sit quiet for a while
my efforts to talk to him amused us both
greatly and i noticed with satisfaction that
he seemed to trust me more and more

  finally my guard spoke asking permis-
sion i judged to leave us and go have his
dinner my heart leaped into my throat
as i saw him go leaving me alone with
tao i concluded that now if ever was
my opportunity tao trusted me-seemed
to like me in fact no one else in the
camp was paying the least attention to us
if only i could on some pretext get myself
a reasonable distance away from him i
would make a run for it

  i was turning this problem over in my
mind when it was unexpectedly solved for
me a low throbbing growing momentar-
ily louder sounded from the air-the hum
of an airplane motor i think tao noticed
it first-i saw him cock his head to one
side listening

  after a moment as the sound increased
he climbed to his feet and shouted an order
to the man nearest us

  the night had clouded over it was un-
usually dark i knew that a plane without
lights was approaching work about the
camp stopped every one stood listening i
looked up at the light-ray platform the
two men there were swinging the light back
and forth sweeping the sky

  suddenly the sound ceased the planes
motor had been shut of almost at the
same instant the light-ray picked up the
plane it was several thousand feet in the
air and almost over our heads coming down
in a spiral a moment more and the light-
ray swung away

  the plane burst into flame and i knew
it was falling an explosion sounded near
at hand the camp was in chaos imme-

diately i faced about to look at tao he
had disappeared

  i waited no longer turning back from
the river i ran at full speed

chapter ix

futile attacks

there seemed to be no pursuit in
a few moments i was clear of the
camp and hidden in the darkness of
the desert i ran perhaps half a mile then
i slowed down to a walk completely wind-
ed turning i could see behind me the
lights of the camp i doubted if even now
they had missed me the bomb dropped
by the airplane and the plane itself falling
almost in their midst must have plunged
them for the time into confusion

  i kept on walking rapidly the desert
here wras almost pathless occasionally i
would cross a wandering wagon track but
none of them seemed going in my direc-
tion after a time i was not sure what
my direction was all about me was a lu-
minous darkness-and silence

  i found myself now almost exhausted
from my exertions of the day i decided
to go possibly a mile farther-to be well
away from the mercutians-and then to lie
down and sleep until daylight

   in about fifteen minutes more i concluded
i had gone far enough and lying down on
the sand was soon fast asleep when i
awoke it was daylight with the sun just
rising

  with returning consciousness i looked
about me in sudden fear but there was no
one in sight i ate the bread and meat
i had in my pocket and feeling much re-
freshed but thirsty i started again for gar-
land

  i made the town soon after noon that
day the little automobile was still stand-
ing in the garage and i started it without
trouble before i left i went up to the
porch of the house

  the bodies of mercer and the mercutian
were still lying there i dragged mercers
body down the steps and put it into the
back seat of the car then i started off
i stuck to the main road and went through


argosy-allstory weekly

mantua at top speed apprehensive that
some of the mercutians might be there this
town like garland was completely burned
only the chimneys were left standing amid
piles of ashes

  at frannie i took on two passengers
there was much curiosity on the part of
those i met along here but i was unwilling
to explain deciding it best to wait and tell
my whole story to the military authorities
at billings

  it was early afternoon when i got back
to billings this was march  i turned
mercers body over to the police who
promptly took me in charge i gave them
a brief outline of what had occurred gen-
eral price whose command of the united
states military operations against the mer-
cutians was announced to the country two
days later had arrived that morning in
billings by airplane i demanded to see
him and when my business was explained
to him he granted me an immediate inter-
view

  general price was a man about fifty a
kindly gentleman of the old southern type
yet of thoroughly military demeanor i
told him everything that had happened to
me in detail as complete as i possibly could
mercers body was examined that same af-
ternoon it was found to have been drilled
completely through the chest by a hole
about the diameter of a lead pencil this
hole did not seem to have been made by
the passage of any foreign object but had
more the aspect of a burn i understood
then-mercer had been killed by a tiny
light-ray projector with a short effective
radius aimed probably like a revolver

  what i was able to tell general price
about the mercutians naturally was inval-
uable to him he asked me then to remain
close to him during the forthcoming oper-
ations we arranged that i was on honor
to give nothing out to my paper without his
approval

  the situation as it appeared during the
next few days was not one of grave danger
we were able to gage now with fair proba-
bility of correctness the offensive strength
of our enemies they had no means of
transportation-could only move from their
present position slowly and with extreme

difficulty the possibility of the vehicle
itself moving occurred to us but as i
pointed out the task of replacing their
heavy apparatus in it and then reassem-
bling the apparatus in a new position made
such a step impractical

  the only weapon the mercutians had
displayed so far was the light-ray in its
several forms this seemed effective for ten
miles at most that the mercutians could
be attacked by our artillery and destroyed
seemed certain

  by the th general price had mobilized
some ten thousand men they encamped
on the prairie near billings the artillery
was moved down to a point near the wyo-
ming state line about fifteen miles directly
north of the mercutian camp

  six days before this forty-eight hours
after i had returned to billings observa-
tion planes had reported the establishment
of two more light-rays similar in appear-
ance to the first during the succeeding
days others rapidly appeared by the th
there were probably thirty of them alto-
gether

  the reports stated that all were set up
within a space seemingly of a few hundred
yards they were of different diameters
some projected in parallel rays others
spread out fan-shaped these latter ap-
peared not to carry so far the first one
that had appeared it was judged had the
longest effective radius of them all

  during these days and nights preceding
the th the light-rockets had been fired
with increasing frequency but none was
observed to carry over six or eight miles
by this time the burned area for a circle
of ten miles all around the mercutian camp
wras entirely depopulated and no additional
destruction was reported

  on the night of the th firing by di-
rections from captive balloons the united
states artillery began its bombardment from
the mon tana-wyoming line after sending
over some twenty shells the firing ceased
it was learned then that they had proven
utterly ineffective the diverging rays of
the mercutian light had thrown a barrage
around their position the shells striking
the light had all exploded harmlessly in the
air
the fire people



  subsequent bombardments made that
night met with no better success the fact
became obvious then that to artillery fire
the mercutians were impregnable for
several days no further military operations
were attempted with the exception of an
occasional shell futilely thrown against the
light-rays

  the newspapers during these days were
full of discussions-scientific and otherwise
-as to how this strange enemy of mankind
ctiuld be destroyed or dislodged this was
like no other warfare in history the news-
paper statements gave the inference that
general price was entirely at a loss how to
proceed

  as a matter of fact the press was quite
correct in that assumption and since the
mercutians were making no offensive moves
general price decided to do nothing until he
was better informed

  i was fortunate enough to be present the
next day at a conference the general had
with severa scientific men who had come
to billings to meet him it was the opin-
ion of these men of science that no artillery
fire could penetrate the light-barrage the
mercutians had thrown about them no
airplane attack was practical and to at-
tack them from the ground with infantry
would be absurd

  on the other hand it seemed obvious
that the mercutians could make no offensive
move either they had probably already
done all the damage that they could if
matters were allowed to remain as they
now were-thus avoiding the useless sacri-
fice of men-inevitably the time would
come when the food supply the mercutians
had brought with them would be exhausted
meanwhile if the invaders decided to move
in their vehicle to another location they
could not do so suddenly without abandon-
ing their apparatus

  any lessening in the number of light-
rays in operation could be taken as an in-
dication that a move of this kind was in
preparation and the warning would give
general price time to execute any attack
that in the meantime might be planned

  it was decided then to remain compara-
tively inactive and await developments from
the opposite side

  during the three months that followed
this decision artillery bases were located
at intervals on a circumference of about
fifteen miles around the mercutian center
these were all on desert country lines
of communication between them were es-
tablished and the air above was thorough-
ly patrolled night and day

 the ten thousand men under general
price it was not thought necessary or ad-
visable to augment they were deployed
around this circumference in front of the
artillery nearer the ten-mile limit ma-
chine-gun outposts manned by volunteers
exclusively were established in garland
mantua and other points within the area
controlled by the light these were for the
purpose of preventing or reporting any
possible movements on foot of the mercu-
tians

  during this time the government was
naturally subjected to much harsh criti-
cism for its waiting attitude it was sug-
gested that armored tanks-relics of the
world war-could be put into commission
these under cover of darkness could be
used to rush the mercutian position this
obviously was an absurd plan since the
light-ray would instantly raise the tempera-
ture of the metal composing the car to such
a height that the men inside would be killed
--not to mention the fact that all explosives
in the car would be instantly detonated

  another suggestion was that a night raid
be made upon the outposts of the camp by
a few men armed with machine guns fired
from the shoulder in an effort to capture
one of the mercutians garbed in a suit im-
pervious to the light with this suit even
one man with a machine gun would prob-
ably be able to clean out the mercutian
camp

  this plan evoked much favorable com-
ment this black material once in our pos-
session could be analyzed and possibly be
duplicated in quantity by us it seemed
the logical way of making progress

  but unfortunately conditions around
the mercutian camp at present were not
the same as that night when i escaped at
that time it would have been feasible now
it was impossible for all the invaders were
within the small circle of projectors and


argosy-allstory weekly

the ground outside this circle was never
free from the diverging rays of the light
also as one newspaper article replied even
with such a suit of armor a man with a
machine gun could do little for the light
would instantly render useless the gun it-
self

  so the controversy went on and general
price waited knowing that each day must
bring the enemy nearer starvation such
was the condition of affairs in the latter
part of june

  then one morning i received a telegram
from alan newland in florida i had been
corresponding with him at intervals but he
had never given me a hint of what had hap-
pened down there

  the telegram read

important mercutian development here

   keep absolutely secret join us here at once

   answer

  i wired him immediately three days
later i was at bay head

chapter x

mielas story

when i reached the little florida
town alan was there to meet me
he would have none of my eager
questions but took me at once by launch
to their bungalow no one was on the
porch when we landed and we went im-
mediately into the livings room there i
found beth and professor newland talking
to this extraordinary girl from another
world of whose existence up to that mo-
ment i had been in complete ignorance
she was dressed especially for my coming
they told me afterward exactly as she had
been that morning when alan found her
they wanted to confound me and they
succeeded

  i stood staring in amazement while beth
quietly introduced me and miela spread
her wings curtsied and replied in a quaint
soft little voice  i am honored sir
tlhen she laughed prettily and extending
her hand added  how do you do bob-
my friend

  when i had partially recovered from my

astonishment miela put on the big blue-
cloth cape she wore constantly to cover her
wings then alan and beth plunged into
an excited explanation of how he had found
miela and how all this time she had re-
mained in seclusion with them there study-
ing their language

  you never have seen such assiduous
young people professor newland put in
 and certainly she has been a wonderful
pupil

  he patted mielas hand affectionately
but i noticed then that his eyes were very
sad as though from some unvoiced trouble
or apprehension

  they had decided the professor said to
keep the girls presence a secret from the
world until they had learned from her in
detail what her mission was the vehicle
in which she had come was still on the
island up the bayou alan had stationed
there three young men of bay head whom
he could trust they were living on the
island guarding it

  during these two months while miela
with uncanny rapidity was mastering their
language the newlands had of course
learned from her all she had to tell them
the situation in wyoming did not necessi-
tate haste on their part and so they had
waited and now with a decision reached
they sent for me

  that evening after supper we all went
out on the bungalow porch and miela told
me her story she spoke quietly with her
hands clasped nervously in her lap at
times in her narrative her eyes shone with
the eager earnest sincerity of her words
at others they grew big and troubled as
she spoke of the problems that were har-
assing her world and mine-the inevitable
self-struggles of humanity whatever its en-
vironment itself its own worst enemy

   i am daughter of lua miela began
slowly  of the great city in the country
of light my mother lua is a teacher of
the people my father thaal died when
still i was a child i-i came to your
earth-

  she paused and turning to beth added
appealingly

   oh there is so much-to begin-how
can i tell-
the fire people



   tell him about tao beth said

   tao i exclaimed

   he leads those who came to your earth
in the north miela went on  he was
my -she looked to alan for the word-
 my suitor there in the great city he
wished me for his wife-for the mother of
his children but that-that was not what
i wished

   youd better tell him about conditions
in your world first miela said alan he
spoke very gently tenderly

  i had already seen during supper how
he felt toward her i could readily under-
stand it too for next to beth she seemed
the most adorable woman i had ever met
there was nothing unusually strange about
her when her wings were covered except
her quaint accent and sometimes curious
gestures and no one could be with her
long without feeling the sweet gentleness of
her nature and loving her for it

   tell him about your women beth
added

  i noticed the affectionate regard she also
seemed to have for miela and i noticed
too that there was in her face that vague
look of sorrow that was in her fathers

  the habitable world of mercury miela
then went on to tell me was divided into
three zones-light twilight and darkness
there was no direct sunlight in the light
country-only a diffused daylight like the
light on our earth when the sky is clouded
over the people of the light country
mielas people were the most civilized and
the ruling race

  in the twilight zone around them grading
back to the dark country various other
peoples dwelt and occasionally warred with
their neighbors for possession of land in the
light

  in the center of the light country di-
rectly underneath the sun-that is where
the sun would always appear near the
zenith-was the fire country here ow-
ing to violent storms the atmospheric en-
velope of the planet was frequently dis-
turbed sufficiently to allow passage for the
suns direct rays then would ensue in
that locality for a limited time a heat so
intense as to destroy life this fire coun-
try was practically uninhabited

   you see bob alan interrupted  the
dark part of mercury-that is the side that
continually faces away from the sun-is
also practically uninhabited only strange
animals and savages live there and the
twilight zones and the ring of light coun-
try with the exception of its center are
too densely populated this has caused
an immense amount of trouble the twi-
light people are an inferior race they have
tried to mix with those of the light coun-
try it doesnt work theres been trouble
for generations trouble over the women for
one thing anyhow the twilight people
have been kept out as much as possible
now this fellow tao-

   let miela explain about the women
first beth interjected

  then miela went on to tell me that only
the females of mercury had wings-given
them by the creator as a protection against
the pursuit of the male at marriage to
insure submission to the will of her hus-
band a womans wings were clipped for
more than a generation now there had been
a growing rebellion on the part of the wom-
en against this practice in this movement
mielas mother lua was a leader to
overcome this masculine desire for physical
superiority and dominance which he had
had for centuries seemed practically impos-
sible yet miela said the leaders of the
women now felt that some progress was
being made in changing public sentiment
although so far not a single man had been
found who would take for mate a woman
with wings unclipped

  this was partly from personal pride and
partly because the laws of the country
made such a union illegal its parties moral
outlaws its children illegitimate and thus
not entitled to the government benefits be-
stowed upon all offspring of legitimate par-
entage it was this man-made law the wom-
en were fighting and of recent years fight-
ing more and more militantly

  this was the situation when tao sud-
denly projected himself into public affairs
as the leader of a new movement tao
had paid court to miela without success
he was active in the fight against the wom-
an movement-a brilliant orator crafty un-
scrupulous a good leader leadership was

to him purely a matter of personal gain
he felt no deep sincere interest in any
public movement for any other reason

  interplanetary communication had be-
come of latter years a possibility science
had invented and perfected the means so
far these vehicles had only been used for
short trips to the outer edge of the at-
mosphere of mercury-trips that were
giving scientific men much valuable knowl-
edge of atmospheric conditions and which
it was thought would ultimately enable
them to counteract the storms and make the
fire country habitable no trips into space
had been made

  tao now came forward with the proposi-
tion to undertake a new world conquest--
a conquest of venus or the earth these
planets recently had been observed from
the vehicles this he said would solve
the land question which after all was
more serious than the clipping of womens
wings

  he found many followers-adventurers
principally to whom the possibilities for
untold personal gain in such a conquest ap-
pealed then abruptly the women took
part dropping for the time their own
fight they opposed tao vigorously if
venus or the earth were inhabited as it
was thought they were such an expedi-
tion would be a war against humanity it
would result in the needless destruction of
human life

  in this controversy the government of the
light country remained neutral but the
women finally won and tao and his fol-
lowers a number of them men of science
were all banished by the government under
pressure of popular sentiment into the twi-
light country

  here taos project fell upon fertile
soil the twilight people had every reason
to undertake such a conquest and tao be-
came their leader in preparing for it these
preparations were known in the light coun-
try the government made no effort to
prevent them it was indeed rather glad
of the possibility of being rid of its dis-
turbing neighbors

  only the women were concerned but they
alone could do nothing since by principle
they were as much opposed to offensive

warfare against the twilight people as
against the possible inhabitants of the earth
miela paused at this point in her narrative
the thing was getting clearer to me now
but i could not reconcile this feeble attempt
to conquer the earth which we were then
fighting in wyoming with the picture she
drew i said so

   she hasnt come to that alan broke
in  you see bob tao with about a
hundred followers was banished to the twi-
light country a couple of years ago there
was plenty of brains in the party scientific
men and such they had only one vehicle
but they have been at work ever since build-
ing a lot of others

   this expedition of tao to wyoming-
with only about a hundred of the twilight
people with him-is not intended to be an
offensive operation at all hes only look-
ing the situation over finding out what
theyre up against they decided before
they started that the light-ray would pro-
tect them from anything on earth and they
have only come to look around

   right now up there -alan leaned
forward earnestly and in the moonlight i
could see the flush on his handsome face-
 right now up there in the twilight coun-
try of mercury theyre working their
damnedest over all kinds of preparations
this wyoming business this summer does
not mean a thing tao will quit it any
minute youll see some morning well
wake up and find them gone probably
theyll destroy their apparatus and not
bother to take it back

   and then in a year or two theyll be
here again not one vehicle next time but
a hundred theyll land all over the earth
at once not on a desert-tao probably
only picked that this time to avoid compli-
cations-but in our big cities new york
paris london all of them at once thats
what weve got to face	

   if tao comes back as he plans we have
not got a chance thats why miela stole
this little vehicle and without it being pub-
licly known in mercury came here to warn
us thats what she was after to help us
risked her life to warn us people of another
world

  alan stopped abruptly and dropping to

                         	a
the fire people



the floor of the porch beside miela laid his
arm across her lap looking up into her face
as though she were a goddess she stroked
his hair tenderly and i could see her eyes
were wet with tears

  there was a moments silence i could
not have known what professor newland
and beth were thinking but a moment later
i understood

  then i realized the sorrow that was
oppressing them both

   what can be done i asked finally

  alan jumped to his feet he began pac-
ing up and down the porch before us evi-
dently he was laboring under a great ner-
vous excitement

   theres nothing to be done he said-

 nothing at all-here on earth we have
not got a chance its up there the thing
has got to be fought out-up there on
mercury-to keep them from returning

  alan paused again when he resumed
his voice was pitched lower but was very
tense

   im going there bob-with miela

  i heard professor newlands sharply in-
drawn breath and saw beths dear face
suddenly whiten

   im going there to fight it out with
them i may come back i may not but
if i am successful they never will-which is
all that matters

   mielas mother gave her up to come
down here and help us it is a little thing
to go back there to help us also if i can
help her people with their own problems so
much the better

  he pulled miela to her feet beside him
and put his arm protectingly about her
shoulders

   and miela is going back to her world
as my wife-her body unmutilated-the
first married woman in mercury with wings
as god gave them to her

chapter xi

to save the world

two days later alan and miela were
quietly married in bay head she
still wore the long cloak and no one
could have suspected she was other than a

   	a

beautiful stranger in the little community
when we got back home alan immediately

made her take off the cloak he wanted
us to admire her wings-to note their long
soft red feathers as she extended them the
symbol and the tangible evidence of her
freedom from male dominance

  she was as sweet about it all as she
could be blushing as though to expose the
wings now that she was married were im-
modest and by the way she regarded alan
by the gentleness and love in her eyes i
could see she would never be above the
guidance the dominance of one man at
least

  the day before their marriage alan had
taken me up the bayou to see the little
silver car in which miela had come i
was intensely curious to learn the workings
of this strange vehicle as soon as we were
inside i demanded that alan explain it all to
me in detail

  he smiled

   thats the remarkable part of it bob
he answered  miela herself didnt thor-
oughly understand either the basic principle
or the mechanism itself when she started
down here

   good lord and she ventured-

   tao was already on the point of leav-
ing when she conceived the idea he had
already made one trip almost to the edge of
the earths atmosphere you know and now
was ready to start again

   that first trip was last november i
said  tell me about that what were
those first light-meteors for

   as far as i can gather from what miela
says alan answered  tao wanted to
make perfectly sure the light-ray would act
in our atmosphere he came-there were
several vehicles they had ready even then-
without other apparatus than those meteors
as we called them those he dropped to
earth with the light-ray stored in them
they did discharge it properly-they
seemed effective the thing was merely a
test tao was satisfied and went back to
arrange for this second preliminary venture
in which he is engaged now

   i understand i said  go on about
miela

   well she and her mother went before


argosy-allstory weekly

the scientific society she calls it-the men
who own and control these vehicles in the
light country they called it suicide no
one could be found to come with her lua
her mother wanted to but miela would not
let her take the risk saying she was needed
more there in her own world

   as a matter of fact the thing while
difficult perhaps to understand in principle
in operation works very simply miela
knew that and merely asked them to show
her how to operate it practically this
they did she spent two days with them-
she learns things rather easily you know-
and then she was ready

  i waited in amazement

   for practical purposes all she had to
understand was the operation of these keys
the pressure of the light-ray in these coils 
-he was standing beside a row of wire
coils which in the semidarkness i had not
noticed before- is controlled by the key-
switches he indicated the latter as he
spoke  they send a current to the outer
metal plates of the car which makes them
repel or attract other masses of matter as
desired

   all that miela had to understand then
was how to operate these keys so as to
keep the base of the vehicle headed toward
the earth they took her to the outer edge
of the atmosphere of mercury over the
dark country and showed her the earth
they have used terrestrial telescopes for
generations and since the invention of this
vehicle telescopes for celestial observation
have been greatly improved

   all miela had to do was keep the air
in here purified that is a simple chemical
operation by using this attractive and
repellent force she allowed the earths grav-
ity and the repelling power of the sur and
mercury to drive her here

  he paused

   but doesnt she-dont you understand
the thing in detail i asked finally

   i think father and i understand it now
better than she does he answered  we
have studied it out here and questioned her
as closely as possible we understand its
workings pretty thoroughly but the exact
nature of the light-ray we do not under-
stand any more than we understand elec-

tricity nor do we understand this metallic
substance which when charged with the
current becomes attractive or repellent in
varying degrees

   yes i said  that i can appre-
ciate

   father has a theory about the light-
ray he went on  which seems rather
reasonable from what we can gather from
miela the thing seems more like elec-
tricity than anything else and father thinks
now that it is generated by dynamos on
mercury similar to those we use here for
electricity

   along that line i said  can you ex-
plain why this light-ray which will imme-
diately set anything on fire that is com-
bustible and which acts through metal like
those artillery shells for instance does not
seem to raise the temperature of the ground
it strikes to any extent

   because like electricity it is dissipated
the instant it strikes the ground the earth
is an inexhaustible storehouse and recep-
tacle for such a force that is why the
broken country around the shoshone river
protected garland and mantua from its di-
rect rays

   tell me about the details of this mech-
anism i said reverting to our original
subject  you say you understand its
workings pretty thoroughly now

   yes i do he admitted  and so does
father but i cannot go into it now with
you you see he added hastily as though
he feared to hurt my feelings  the scien-
tific men of mercury-some of them-ob-
jected to mielas coming on the ground that
the inhabitants of the earth obtaining from
her a knowledge that would enable them
to voyage through space might take advan-
tage of that knowledge to undertake an in-
vasion of mercury

   as a matter of fact that was a remote
possibility i could explain to you all i
know about this mechanism without much
danger of your ever being able to build such
a car but miela promised them that she
would use all possible precautions in the
event of her having any choice in the mat-
ter to prevent the earth people learning
anything about it

   father and i have examined everything
the fire people

 

here closely but no one else has-and i
am sure miela would prefer no one else did
you understand bob

  i did understand and of course i had to
be satisfied with that

   it seems to me i said when later in
the day we were discussing affairs in wyo-
ming  that with things in mercury as we
now know they are it would help the situa-
tion tremendously if tao and these twilight
people with him were prevented from ever
returning

   thats my idea exactly professor
newland agreed

  i could see by the look on his face he
was holding on to this thought as a pos-
sibility that might make alans plan un-
necessary

   ive thought about it constantly the
professor said  ever since these facts first
came to us through miela it wvuld be
important with his expedition here a total
failure i think we might assume that noth-
ing more would be done up there in at-
tempting to conquer the earth ive tried
to make alan see that we should give the
authorities all the information we have it
might help-something might be accom-
plished-

   nothing would father alan inter-
rupted  there wouldnt be time and
even if this expedition of taos were de-
stroyed i dont see why thats any guar-
antee another attempt would not be made
miela doesnt either and she ought to
know

   besides dont you see bob -he
turned to me earnestly- i cant have the
eyes of the world turned on miela and her
affairs why think of it-this little wom-
an sent to washington questioned photo-
graphed written about made sport of per-
haps in the newspapers and all for noth-
ing it is unthinkable

   you may be right my boy said the
professor sadly  i am giving in to you
but i still-

   the thing has come to me said alan
 a duty-a responsibility put squarely up
to me ive accepted it ill do my best
all the way

  a week after alan and miela were mar-
ried the report came that the mercutians

had suddenly departed abandoning after
partly destroying their apparatus the
world for a few days was in trepidation
fearing a report that they had landed some-
where else but no such report came

  three days later alan and miela followed
them into space

  professor newland beth and i went up
the bayou with them that morning they left
we were a solemn little party none of us
seemingly wishing to voice the thoughts
that possessed us all

  professor newland never spoke once dur-
ing the trip when the moment of final
parting came he kissed miela quietly and
pressing alans hand said simply  good
luck my boy we appreciate what you
are doing for us come back some day if
you can

 then he faced about abruptly and
trudged back to the launch alone as pa-
thetic a figure as i have ever seen we
all exchanged our last good-bys little beth
in tears clinging to alan and then kissing
miela and making her promise some day to
come back with alan when he had acconn
plished his mission

  then they entered the vehicle its heavy
door closed a moment later it rose si-
lently-slowly at first then with increasing
velocity until we could see it only as a
little speck in the air above us and then
it was gone

chapter xii

the landing on mercury

narrative continued by alan newland

with hardly more than a perceptible
tremor our strange vehicle came to
rest upon the surface of mercury
for a moment miela and i stood regarding
each other silently then she left her sta-
tion at the levers of the mechanism and
placed her hands gently on my shoulders
you are welcome my husband here to my
world

  i kissed her glowing earnest face we
had reached our journeys end my work
was about to begin-upon my own efforts
now depended the salvation of that great


argosy-allstory weekly

world i had left behind what difficulties
what dangers would i have to face here
among the people of this strange planet i
thrilled with awe at the thought of it and
i prayed god then to hold me firm and
steadfast to my purpose

  miela must have divined my thoughts
for she said simply  you wall have great
power here alan and it is in my heart that
you will succeed

  we slid back one of the heavy metallic
curtains and looked out through the thick
glass of the window it was daylight-a
diffused daylight like that of a cloudy mid-
day on my own earth an utterly barren
waste met my gaze we seemed to have
landed in a narrow valley huge cliffs rose
on both sides to a height of a thousand
feet or more

  these cliffs as well as the floorof the
valley itself shone with a brilliant glare
even in the half light of the sunless day
they were not covered with soil but
seemed rather to be almost entirely metal-
lic copper in color the whole visible
landscape was devoid of any sign of vege-
tation nor was there a single living thing
in sight

  i shuddered at the inhospitable bleak-
ness of it

   where are we miela

  she smiled at my tone it was my first
sight of mercury except vague distant
glimpses of its surface through the mist
coming down

   you do not like my world

  she was standing close beside me and at
her smiling words raised one of her glo-
rious red wings and spread it behind me
as though for protection then becoming
serious once more she answered my ques-
tion

   we are fortunate alan it is the val-
ley of the sun in the light country i
know it well we are very close to the
great city

  i breathed a sigh of relief

   ill leave it all to you little wife shall
we start at once

  her hand pressed mine

   i shall lead you now she said  but
afterward-you it will be who leads me-
who leads us all

  she crossed to the door fastenings as
she loosed them i remember i heard a slight
hissing sound before i could reach her
she slid back the door a great wave of air
rushed in upon us sweeping us back against
the wall i clutched at something for sup-
port but the sweep of wind stopped almost
at once

  i had stumbled to my knees  miela
i cried in terror

  she was beside me in an instant wide-
eyed with fear which even then i could see
was fear only for me

  i struggled to my feet my head was
roaring all the blood in my body seemed
rushing to my face

  after a moment i felt better miela
pulled me to a seat

   i did not think alan the pressure
of the air is different here from your world
it was so wrong of me for i knew it
wras so when i landed there on your earth

  i had never thought to ask her that nor
had she ever spoken of it to me she went
on now to tell me how when first she had
opened the door on that little florida island
all the air about her seemed rushing awray
she had felt then as one feels transported
quickly to the rarified atmosphere of a great
height

  here the reverse had occurred we had
brought with us and maintained an air
density such as that near sea level on earth
but here on mercury the air was far denser
and its pressure had rushed in upon us
instantly the door was opened miela had
been affected to a much less extent than

i	and in consequence recovered far more
quickly

  the feeling after the first nausea the
pressure and pain in my ears aris the roar-
ing in my head had passed away a sense
of heaviness an inability to breathe with
accustomed freedom remained with me for
days

  we sat quiet for some minutes and then
left the vehicle miela was dressed now as
i had first seen her on the florida bayou
as we stepped upon the ground she sudden-
ly tore the veil from her breast spread her
wings and with a laugh of sheer delight
flew rapidly up into the air i stood watch-
ing her my heart beating fast up-up
the fire people



she went into the gray haze of the sky
then i could see her spread her great
wings motionless a giant bird soaring over
the valley

  a few moments more and she was again
beside me alighting on the tip of one toe
with perfect poise and grace almost within
reach of my hand

  i do not quite know what feelings pos-
sessed me at that moment perhaps it was
a sense of loss as i saw this woman i loved
fly away into the air while i remained
chained to the ground i cannot tell but
when she came back dropping gently down
beside me ethereal and beautiful as an
angel from heaven itself a sudden rush of
love swept over me

  i crushed her to me glorying in the
strength of my arms and the frailness of
her tender little body

  when i released her she looked up into
my eyes archly

   you do not like me to fly your wife
is free-and oh alan it is so good-so
good to be back here again where i can
fly

  she laughed at my expression

   you are a man too-like all the men
of my world that is the feeling you came
here to conquer alan-so that the women
here may all keep their wings-and be
free

  i think i was just a little ashamed of
myself for a moment but i knew my feel-
ing had been only human i did want her
to fly to keep those beautiful wings and
in that moment they came to represent
not only her freedom but my trust in her
my very love itself

  i stroked their sleek red feathers gently
with my hand

  i shall never feel that way again
miela i said earnestly

  she laughed once more and kissed me
and the look in her eyes told me she under-
stood

  the landscape from this wider view-
point seemed even more bleak and deso-
late than before the valley was perhaps
half a mile broad and wound away upward
into a bald range of mountains in the dis-
tance

  the ground under my feet was like a

richly metallic ore in places it was wholly
metal smooth and shining like burnished
copper below us the valley broadened
slightly falling into what i judged must
be opten country where lay the city of our
destination

  for some minutes i stood appalled at the
scene i had often been in the deserts of
america but never have i felt so great a
sense of desolation always before it had
been the lack of water that made the land
so arid and always the scene seemed to
hold promise of latent fertility as though
only moisture were needed to make it spring
into fruition

  nothing of the kind was evident here
there was indeed no lack of water i
could see a storm cloud gathering in the
distance the air i was breathing seemed
unwarrantably moist and all about me on
the ground little pools remained from the
last rainfall but here there was no soil
not so much even as a grain of sand seemed
to exist the air was warm as warm as
a midsummers day in my own land a pe-
culiarly oppressive moist heat

  i had been prepared for this by miela
i was bareheaded since there never was
to be direct sunlight my feet were clad
in low shoes with rubber soles i wore socks
for the rest i had on simply one of my old
pairs of short white running pants and a
sleeveless running shirt with the excep-
tion of the shoes it was exactly the costume
i had worn in the races at college

  i had been standing motionless hardly
more than a step from the car in which we
had landed suddenly in the midst of my
meditations on the strange scene about me
miela said

    go there alan

  she was smiling and pointing to a little
rise of ground near by i looked at her
blankly

   jump alan she added

  the spot to which she pointed was per-
haps forty feet away i knew what she
meant and stepping back a few paces
came running forward and leaped into the
air i cleared the intervening space with
no more effort than i could have jumped
less than half that distance on earth

  miela flew over beside me


argosy-allstory weekly

   you see alan rny husband it is not
so bad perhaps that i can fly

  she was smiling whimsically but i could
see her eyes were full of pride

   there is no other man on mercury who
could do that alan she added

  i tried successive leaps then always with
the same result i calculated that here the
pull of gravity must be something less than
one-half that on the earth it was far more
than father had believed

  miela watched my antics laughing and
clapping her hands with delight i found
i tired very quickly-that is i was winded
this i attributed to the greater density of
the air i was breathing

  in five minutes i was back at mielas
side panting heavily

   if i can-ever get so i breathe right-
i said

  she nodded  a very little time i
think

  i sat down for a moment to recover my
breath miela explained then that we were
some ten miles from the fertile country
surrounding the city in which her mother
lived and about fifteen miles from the out-
skirts of the city itself i give these dis-
tances as they would be measured on earth
we decided to start at once we took
nothing with us the journey would be a
short one and we could easily return at
some future time for what we had left be-
hind we needed no food for so short a
trip and plenty of water was at hand

  only one thing miela would not part
with-the single memento she had brought
from earth to her mother she refused to
let me touch it but insisted on carrying
it herself guarding it jealously

  it was beths little ivory hand mirror

  we started off miela had wound the
filmy scarf about her shoulders again with
a pretty little gesture

   i need not use wings alan when i am
with you we shall go together you and
i-on the ground

  and then as i started off vigorously she
added plaintively from behind me  if-if
you will go slow my husband or will wait
for me

  i altered my pace to suit hers i had
quite recovered my breath now and for

the moment felt that i could carry her
much faster than she could walk i did
gather her into my arms once and ran
forward briskly while she laughed and
struggled with me to be put down she
seemed no more than a little child in my
arms but as before the heavy air so op-
pressed me that in a few moments i was
glad enough to set her again upon her
feet

  the valley broadened steadily as we ad-
vanced for several miles the look of the
ground remained unchanged i wondered
what curious sort of metal this might be-
so like copper in appearance i doubted if
it were copper since even in this hot moist
air it seemed to have no property of oxida-
tion

  i asked miela about it and she gave me
its mercutian name at once but of course
that helped me not a bit she added that
outcroppings of it almost in the pure state
like the great deposits of native copper i
had seen on earth occurred in many parts
of mercury

  i remembered then bob trevors mention
of it as the metal of the apparatus used by
the invaders of wyoming

  we went on three or four miles without
encountering a single sign of life no in-
sects stirred underfoot no birds flew over-
head we might have been-by the look of
it-alone on a dead planet

   is none of your mountain country in-
habited miela i asked

  she shook her head

   only on the plains do people live
there is very little of good land in the light
country and so many people that it is
which has caused much trouble in the past
it is for that many times the twilight
people have made war upon us

  i found myself constantly able to breathe
more easily our progress down the valley
seemed now irritatingly slow for i felt i
could walk or run three times faster than
miela finally i suggested to her that she
fly keeping near me and that i would
make the best speed forward i could she
stared at me quizzically then seeing i
was quite sincere she flung her little arms
up about my neck and pulled me down to
kiss her
the fire people



   oh alan-the very best husband in
all the universe you are none other could
there be-like you

  she had just taken off her scarf again
when suddenly i noticed a little speck in
the sky ahead it might have been a tiny
bird flying toward us from the plains be-
low

   miela-look 

  she followed the direction of my hand
the speck grew rapidly larger

   a girl alan she said after a moment
 let us wait

  we stood silent watching it was indeed
a girl flying over the valley some two or
three hundred feet above the ground as
she came closer i saw her wings were blue
not red like mielas she came directly to-
ward us

  suddenly miela gave a little cry

  anina anina

  without a word to me she spread her
wings and flew up to meet the oncoming
girl

  i stood in awe as i watched them they
met almost above me and i could see them
hovering with clasped hands while they
touched cheeks in affectionate greeting
then releasing each other they flew rap-
idly away together-smaller and smaller
until a turn in the valley hid them entirely
from my sight

  i sat down abruptly a lump was in my
throat a dismal lonesomeness in my heart
i knew miela would return in a moment-
that she had met some friend or relative-
yet i could not suppress the vague feeling
of sorrow and the knowledge of my own
incapacity that swept over me

  for the first time then i wanted wings-
wanted them myself-that i might join this
wife i loved in her glorious freedom of the
air and i realized too for the first time
how that condition miela so deplored on
mercury had come to pass i could under-
stand now very easily how it was that mar-
ried women were deprived by their hus-
bands of these wings which they themselves
were denied by the creator

  hardly more than ten minutes had passed
before i saw the two girls again flying to-
ward me they alighted a short distance
away and approached me hand in hand

  the girl with miela i could see now
was somewhat shorter even slighter of
build and two or three years younger her
face held the same delicate wistful beauty
the two girls strongly resembled one an-
other in feature the newcomer was
dressed in similar fashion to miela-san-
dals on her feet and silken trousers of a
silvery white fastened at the ankles with
golden cords

  her wings as i have said were blue-a
delight light blue that as i afterward no-
ticed matched her eyes her hair was the
color of spun gold she wore it in two long
thick braids over her shoulders and fastened
at the waist and knee she was in very
truth the most ethereal human being i had
ever beheld and-next to miela-the most
beautiful

  miela pulled her forward and she came
on blushing with the sweet shyness of a
child she was -winding her silken silver
scarf about her breast hastily as best she
could with her free hand

   my sister anina-alan said miela
simply

  the girl stood undecided then evident-
ly obeying mielas swift words of instruc-
tion she stood up on tiptoe put her arms
about my neck and kissed me full on the
lips

  miela laughed gayly

  you must love her very much alan
and she-your little sister-will love you
too she is very sweet

  then her face sobered suddenly

  tao has returned alan and he has
sent messengers to our city they are ap-
pealing to our people to join tao in his
great conquest they say tao has here
with him on mercury a captive earth-
man with wonderful strength of body who
will help in the destruction of his own
world

chapter xiii

the captive earth-man

as we came out of the valley i had my
 first view of the great city it oc-
cupied a huge mound-shaped circular
mountain which rose alone out of the wide


argosy-allstory weekly

plain that spread before me as far as i
could see extended a rich muddy soil par-
tially covered with water a road led out
of the valley stretching across these wet
fields toward the base of the mountain it
was built on an embankment some eight or
ten feet high of the red metallic ore of the
mountains

  all along the base of this embankment
with their roots in the water graceful trees
like palms curved upward over the road
the landscape was dotted with these and
other tropical trees the scene was indeed
essentially tropical

  i wondered at the continued absence of
sight of human beings the fields were
quite evidently under cultivation a rise of
ground off to the left was ridged with ter-
races as we passed on along the road i
saw a rude form of plow standing where it
had been left in a field which evidently was
producing rice or something akin to it yet
there was not a person in sight only ahead
in the sky i could see a little cluster of black
dots that miela said was a group of females
hovering about the summit of the great
city

    it is the time of sleep now alan she
said in answer to my question

  i had not thought of that it was broad
daylight but here on mercury there was no
day or night but always the same half light
as of a cloudy day

  the mountain on which the city was
built was dotted thickly with palms and
as we approached i made out the houses of
the city set amid the trees with broad
streets converging at the top as we came
still closer i saw that the summit of the
mountain was laid out like some beautiful
tropical garden with a broad low-lying pal-
ace in its center

  when we were still a mile or so away
from the outskirts of the city miela spoke
in her soft native tongue to anina the
girl smiled at me in parting and unwinding
the veil from about her breast flew into the
air

  we stood watching her as she winged her
way onward toward the sleeping city when
she had dwindled to a tiny speck i sighed
unconsciously and turned away and again
miela smiled at me with comprehension

   we started forward miela chattering
now lilce a little child she seemed eager to
tell me all about the new world of hers i
was entering and there was indeed so much
to tell she was often at a loss what to de-
scribe first

   she named the cereal which constituted
the only crop to which these marsh lands
were suitable from her description i made
out it was similar to rice only of a some-
what larger grain it formed she said the
staple article of food of the nation

   as we approached the base of the great
city mountain the ground began gradually
rising the drainage thus afforded made it
constantly drier as we advanced it as-
sumed now- more the character of a heavy
loam

   still farther on we began passing occa-
sional houses-the outskirts of the city it-
self they were square single-story ugly
little buildings built of reddish stone and
clay flat-roofed and raised a foot or two
off the ground on stone pilings they had
large rectangular windows most of them
open a few with lattice shades the door-
ways stood open without sign of a door
access to the ground was obtained by a nor-
row board incline

   interspersed with these stone houses i
saw many single-room shacks loosely built
of narrow boards from the palm trees and
thatched with straw in these miela ex-
plained lived poorer people who worked
in the rice fields for the small land owners

   we reached the base of the mountain
proper and i found myself in a broad
street with houses on both sides this
street seemed to run directly to the summit
of the mountain sloping upward at a sharp
angle we turned into it and began our
climb into the sleeping city it was laid
out regularly all its principal streets run-
ning from the base of the mountain upward
to its summit where they converged in a
large open space in which the castle i have
already mentioned was situated the cross-
streets formed concentric rings about the
mountain at intervals of perhaps five hun-
dred feet down its sides-small circles near
the top lengthening until at the base the
distance around was i should judge ten
miles or more
the fire people



  we climbed upward nearly to the sum-
mit then miela turned into one of the
cross-streets i had found the climb tre-
mendously tiring though miela seemed not
to notice it unduly and i was glad enough
when we reached this street which girdled
the mountain almost at the same level we
had gone only a short distance along it
however when miela paused before a house
set somewhat back from the road on a ter-
race

   my home she said and her voice
trembled a little with emotion  our home
it shall be now alan with lua and anina
our mother and sister

  a low bushy hedge separated the street
from a garden that surrounded the house
the building was of stone two stories in
height it was covered with a thick vine
bearing a profusion of vivid red flowers on
its flat roof were tiny palm trees a pergola
with trellised vines and still more flowers
most of them of the same brilliant red the
whole was surrounded by a waist-high para-
pet

  one corner of the roof was covered with
thatch-a little nest where one might be
sheltered from the rain and in which i
could see a bed of palm fiber at one side
of the house a tremendous cluster of bam-
boo curved upward and over the roof a
path of chopped coconut husks led from the
street to a short flight of steps in the terrace
at the front entrance

  we passed along this path and entered
through the open doorway directly into
what i judged was the living room of the
dwelling it was some thirty feet long and
half as broad with a high ceiling and stone
floor its three windows fronted the gar-
den we had just left in its farther wall a
low archway led into an adjoining room
the furniture consisted only of two or three
small tables and several low wide couches
all of bamboo

  a woman and the girl anina rose as we
entered anina ran toward us eagerly the
elder woman stood quietly wraiting she
was about forty years of age as tall as
miela but heavier of build she was
dressed in loose silk trousers gathered at
waist and ankle and a wide sash that
covered her breast her hair was iron gray

cut short at the base of the neck from
her shoulders i saw hanging a cloak that
entirely covered her wings

  as she turned toward us i saw a serious
dignified wholly patrician face with large
kindly dark eyes a high intellectual fore-
head and a firm yet sensitive mouth she
was the type of woman one would instinct-
ively mark for leader

  miela ran forward to greet her mother
falling upon her knees and touching her
forehead to the elder womans sandaled
feet as she rose i could see there were
tears in the eyes of them both then
miela presented me i stood for an instant
confused not knowing quite what i should
do

  miela laughed her gay little laugh

   bow lowt alan-as i did-to our
mother

  i knelt to her respectfully and she put
her hands lightly upon my head speaking
low words of greeting then sis i stood up
again i met her eyes and smiled an answer
to the gentle smile on her lips from that
moment i felt almost as though she were
my own mother and i am sure she took me
then into her heart as her son

  the introduction over i turned toward
one of the windows leaving miela to talk
with her mother anina followed me
standing timidly by my side with her big
curious eyes looking up into my face

   youre a sweet dear little sister i
said  and i am going to love you very
much

  i put my arm about her shoulders and
she smiled as though she understood me
yielding to my embrace with the ready
friendship of a child for some moments we
stood together looking out of the window
and talking to each other with words that
were quite unintelligible to us both then
miela suddenly called me

   we shall eat now alan she said
 for you are hungry i know and above
there is water that we may wash her
face clouded as she went on  our mother
has told me a little that has happened it
is very serious alan as you shall hear
tao with his great news of your wonder-
ful world is very fast winning over our
men to his cause a revolt there may be


argosy-allstory weekly

here in our own city--a revolution against
our government our king we can only
look to you now my husband to save our
country from tao as well as your own

  the situation as i found it in the light
country was as miela said alarmingly se-
rious during the two years tao had been
in the twilight country preparing for his
attack upon the earth his project had
caused little stir among the light country
people

  its women were at first perturbed at
this wanton attack upon the humanity of
another world but since the earth was such
an unknown quantity and the fact of its
being inhabited at all was problematical
interest in the affair soon lagged the
government of the light country concerned
itself not at all

  but now upon taos return the news of
his venture as told by the emissaries he sent
to the light country struck its people like
a bombshell these emissaries--all men
-had come to the great city and finding
their presence tolerated by the authorities
had immediately started haranguing the
people

  the men were inclined to listen and
many of them openly declared their sym-
pathy with tao these however were for
the most part of the poorer more ignorant
classes or those more adventurous less
scrupulous individuals to whom the pros-
pect of sudden riches appealed

   why doesnt your government just
throw taos men out if theyre causing so
much trouble i asked  they never
should have been allowed in the country
at all

  miela smiled sadly

   that is so my husband that should
have been done but now it is too late
our men would protect them now declar-
ing their right to stay here and speak
there might be bloodshed among our peo-
ple and that must not be

   are they armed i asked

  she shook her head  no one is armed
with the light-ray to carry it is a crime
punishable by death for the light is too
destructive

   but tao has it

   tao has it indeed but he is not so

great a monster that he would use it against
us

  i was not so sure of tihat and i said so
 you dont mean to tell me miela that
your government has allowed tao to pre-
pare all this destructive armament without
itself arming

  again she shook her head we have
been preparing too and all our young men
can be called if occasion comes but that
must never be it would be too terrible

  miela and i occupied that first night on
mercury a broad wrooden bed built low to
the floor with a mattress of palm fiber at
first i could not sleep but lay thinking over
the many things she had told me the
light in the room too was strange lattice
covered the windows but it was like trying
to sleep at midday and the heat and heavi-
ness of the air oppressed me i dropped
off finally to be awakened by mielas voice
calling me to breakfast

  we sat down to the morning meal at a
low table set with shining plates and gob-
lets of copper or whatever the metal was
and napery of silk the rice formed our
main article of food with sugar milk and
a beverage not unlike coffee there was
also a meat like beef although more highly
flavored and a number of sickish sweet
fruits of a kind entirely new to me which i
could do no more than taste

  we were served by a little maid whose
darker skin and heavier features proclaimed
her of another race--a native of the fire
country miela told me she was dressed
in a brown tunic of heavy silk reaching
from waist to knee her thick black hair
was cut to her shoulders

  on her left arm above the elbow was
welded a broad band of copper inscribed
with a mark to identify lua as her owner
for she was a slave her torso was bare
except for a cloak like luas which hung
from her shoulders in the back to cover
her wings by this i knew she could not
fly

  it was not until some time afterward
that i learned the reason for this covering
of the clipped wings the wing joints were
severed just above the waist line the
feathers on the remaining upper portions
the fire people



were clipped but through disuse these
feathers gradually dropped out entirely

  the flesh and muscle underneath was re-
pulsive in appearance-for which reason it
was always kept covered lua showed me
her wings once-mere shrunken stumps of
what had once been her most glorious pos-
session i did not wonder then that the
women were ready to fight almost rather
than part with them

  difficulties of language made our conver-
sation during the meal somewhat halting
although miela acted as interpreter lua
and anina both expressed their immediate
determination to learn english and with
the same persistence that miela had shown
they set aside nearly everything else to ac-
complish it

  we decided that we should see the king
and arrange our future course of action
whatever was to be done should be done
at once-that we all agreed-for taos men
were steadily gaining favor with a portion of
the people and we had no means of know-
ing what they would attempt to do

   what will your people think of me
i suddenly asked miela

   we have sent our king word that you
are here she answered  and we have
asked that he send a guard to take you to
the castle this morning

   a guard

  she smiled  it is better that the people
see you first as a man of importance you
will go to the king under guard few will
notice you then will he our ruler ar-
range that you are shown to the people as a
great man-one who has come here to help
us-one who is trusted and respected by
our king you see my husband the dif-
ference

  i did indeed though i wondered a little
how i should justify this exalted position
which was being thrust upon me after
breakfast lua and anina busied themselves
about the house while miela and i went to
the rooftop to wait for the kings summons
from here i had my first really good view
of the city at close range

  mielas home sat upon a terrace leveled
off on the steep hillside all the houses in
the vicinity were similarly situated be-

hind us the mountain rose steeply in front
it dropped away affording an extended view
of the level palm-dotted country below

  the slope of hillside rising abruptly be-
hind us held another house just above the
level of the rooftop we were on as i sat
there looking idly about i thought i saw a
figure lurking near this higher building i
called mielas attention to it-the obscure
figure of a man standing against a huge
palm trunk

  as we watched the figure stepped into
plainer view i saw then it was a man evi-
dently looking down at us i stood up
there was no one else in sight except a
woman on the roof of the other house hold-
ing an infant

  something about the mans figure seemed
vaguely familiar my heart leaped sud-
denly

   miela i whispered  surely that-
that is no one of your world

  her hand clutched my arm tightly as the
man stepped forward again and waved at
us i crossed the rooftop miela following
at my sudden motion the man hesitated
then seemed about to run i hardly know
what thoughts impelled me but suddenly i
shouted

   wait

  at the sound of my voice he whirled
around stopped dead an instant and then
with an answering call came running down
the hillside

  the earth-man cried miela the
earth-man of tao it must be

  we hurried down through the house and
arrived at its back entrance coming to-
ward us at a run across the garden was the
man-unmistakably one of my own world

  my hurried glance showed me he was
younger than i-a short stocky red-headed
chap dressed in dirty white duck trousers
and a torn white linen shirt

  he came on at full speed

   hello i called

  he stopped abruptly for an instant we
stared at each other then he grinned
broadly

   well i dont know who you are he
ejaculated  but i want to say it certainly
does me good to see you

 former chief united states secret service

 and george barton

 i-the flaw in the alibi

peabody smith during his service
with the government got his first big
chance when the chief of the united
states secret service called him into his pri-
vate office in the treasury building in
washington and gave him the assignment
to run down the man or men who were
flooding the country with counterfeit one-
hundred-dollar bills it was a big job his
reputation as a detective was on trial the
purity of the national currency was at stake
and millions of dollars were involved he
was not given the faintest clew except that
the bogus money was being circulated in
philadelphia baltimore and new york

the instructions of the head of the service
were compressed into four short words

    go and get em 

   peabody smith took the congressional
limited for new york that night a sort
of intuition told him that the drama in
which he was to be such a conspicuous
figure was going to be enacted in that me-
tropolis on the way over he read the
newspaper clippings that told of the awe
and consternation in business circles over
the success of the new counterfeits he had
imagination and he could see the tragedy
that lay behind the brief news stories of the
bad bank notes he knew the cashier of
the adventures of peabody smith



one financial institution had committed sui-
cide everywhere he could sense misery
and unhappiness in the wake of these coun-
terfeits the one consolation that came to
him as he thought of the hard work that
lay before him was the fact that the chief
had given him tim burke as his assistant

  peabody smith was jocularly known
among his colleagues as the yankee detec-
tive he was born on cape cod and never
fully recovered from it he was tall lean
and sinewy and when he arose always
seemed to go through the process of uncurl-
ing his legs he was a combination of
aristocrat and democrat his first name
came from one of the oldest families in new
england and his last one from one of the
most numerous in the world his hair was
grayish and there were crows feet about his
eyes he had a face that was habitually
sad a melancholy face the face of a funeral
director and yet he had the ability to keep
the table in a roar

  when he smiled it lit up his whole coun-
tenance it was as though some one had
suddenly struck a light in a dark room he
had a deliberation in speech that was dis-
concerting to those who were not familiar
with his mannerisms and those inquiring
gray eyes and that silent tongue had caused
many a hardened criminal to confess he
drank english breakfast tea by the quart
and smoked pittsburgh stogies by the bale
josh billings was his favorite author and
he regarded the phonetic spelling humorist
as a greater philosopher than ralph waldo
emerson aside from these small things he
may be said to have had no small vices

  twenty-four hours after his arrival in
new york he learned of two tradesmen
who had been the victims of the hundred-
dollar-note swindle one was a jeweler on
upper fifth avenue and the other a tobac-
conist on lower broadway in each case
there had been a small purchase and the
customer had been given the change in per-
fectly good currency suspicion rested on
a man and a woman who were stopping at
the high-priced hotel fostorio the regis-
ter disclosed the names of dwight tompkins
and edna tompkins they had adjoining
rooms on the twenty-first floor of the tow-
ering harbor of hospitality mr tompkins

was the first to return to the hotel that eve-
ning and peabody smith halting him in the
lobby engaged in a heart-to-heart conversa-
tion mr tompkins was a man of about
forty with a little black mustache and he
was perfectly groomed from head to foot

   i certainly paid the cigar man with a
hundred-dollar bill he admitted with en-
gaging frankness  but i did not have the
faintest suspicion that it was not good

   of course not agreed peabody smith
 but as a matter of routine  must ask
you to take me to your room

  tompkins made no difficulty about this
but he was manifestly disturbed over the in-
cident as any man might well be when
they reached the twenty-first floor they
found a little man with a bullet head and
beady eyes waiting in front of the room
door it was tim burke also of the united
states secret service evidently peabody
smith while trusting mr dwight tomp-
kins was taking no chances with burke
standing guard in the room smith quickly
and expeditiously  frisked  the well-
dressed guest one result of this was the
finding of a wallet containing ten one-hun-
dred-dollar bills they were all counter-
feit also he opened a handbag belonging
to mr tompkins and found a plain white
envelope with seventeen other counterfeit
hundred-dollar bills

  dwight tompkins was plainly annoyed
but he did not exhibit the slightest con-
fusion or fear he pulled out a silver-
mounted case and passed cigars to his visi-
tors also he invited them to have some
refreshments from his private stock an invi-
tation that was politely declined

   obviously gentlemen he began non-
chalantly  this requires explanation

   obviously concurred peabody without
the slightest trace of sarcasm

   i understand your duty and i realize
my position tompkins continued  and i
will tell you the whole truth im going to
lay all my cards on the table and i promise
to abide by the result of the game it may
tax your credulity but i can assure you
that i am perfectly innocent of any inten-
tional wrongdoing

   proceed said smith with the air of a
man who dislikes long introductions


argosy-allstory weekly

   i am engaged in the printing and en-
 graving business in huntsville said tomp-
 kins taking the hint  and i came to new
 york for a double purpose-a vacation and
 a wedding tour this adds slightly to my
 embarrassment but i want to be perfectly
 straightforward with you and im not going
 to hold anything back i was only mar-
 ried a few days ago mrs tompkins is with
 me it was not exactly an elopement be-
 cause i have known her for a long time but
 the marriage is a secret so far as my iriends
 and relatives are aware

    on the afternoon before last as i was
 going from the elevator to the desk of the
 hotel the electric lights suddenly went up
 and i noticed a large white envelope in a
 comer of the corridor i picked it up and
 found inside of it thirty one-hundred-dollar
 bills naturally i was stunned for a mo-
 ment as soon as i recovered my self-
 possession i went to the desk and notified
 the clerk that i had picked up some money
 and that if the owner would communicate
 with me and describe his property it would
 be returned

    it was about dusk  assume com-
 mented peabody

    just about after that not satisfied i
 went to the office of the morning gazette
 and inserted an advertisement in the lost
 and found column saying that if the owner
 would prove his property it would be re-
 stored immediately i do not see that it was
 possible to do more than that

    more could not be expected conceded
 the detective

    as a further proof of my truthfulness
 continued tompkins  i can refer you to
 the editor of the local newspaper in my
 town to the president of the national bank
 to the officers of the chamber of commerce
 or to any of the citizens of huntsville

ii

  before another day had passed pea-
 body smith made it his business to get into
 communication with nearly all of the per-
 sons named and they verified all that had
 been stated by dwight tompkins they
 went further than that two of the lead-
 ing citizens of the town wired that if their

 townsman was in difficulty they would
 cheerfully go his bail or come to his rescue
 in any other way that might be suggested
 the detective interviewed the hotel clerk
 and he testified that their guest had in-
 formed him of the finding of the money
 finally peabody smith called at the office
 of the newspaper and found that the ad-
 vertisement had been inserted in the lost
 and found column as described in order
 to make assurance doubly sure he asked
 for the original copy of the advertisement
 and it was in the handwriting oi dwight
 tompkins and over it was the stamp of
 the newspaper office showing the hour at
 which it had been handed in

  this was surely enough to satisfy any
ordinary mortal of the innocence of dwight
tompkins but peabody smith mooned
about the hotel displaying neither elation
nor dejection his gray eyes were alter-
nately puzzled and inquiring he smoked
one pittsburgh stogie after another and
going into the dining room of the hostelry
he consumed unheard-of quantities of tea
the man was having a mental struggle but
finally he reached his conclusion and he
announced it to his assistant in a matter-
of-fact way

    tim he said  ive decided to place
 tompkins under arrest

    what for asked the astonished burke
  because hes given you such a clean bill
 of health

    no answered the other solemnly  for
 psychological reasons

  the hard-headed one shrugged his shoul-
ders

    this gets my goat he cried with char-
 acteristic frankness  but i suppose its al-
 ways good policy to make an arrest when
 youre on a job you get credit in the news-
 papers even if you have no case

  peabody smith was staring intently at
tim burke but he did not hear what his
assistant was saying his mind was on the
twenty-first floor of the hotel fostorio

   divide and conquer he was murmur-
ing  tim we must separate the man and
the woman there isnt anv other way to
it

  they took the elevator and were whisked
skyward dwight tompkins and edna
the adventures of peabody smith



tompkins were in the little sitting room
adjoining his apartment they received
the detectives with surprise but politeness
peabody looked directly at tompkins but
burke could scarcely keep his eyes from the
litde bit of femininity who gazed up at him
in such a pathetic and appealing manner
she must have recognized them from the
description that had been given her by the
man for she turned to smith confidingly

   dwight has just been telling me that
he told you everything it was the right
thing to do and im proud of him rut if
we can help you to find the people that
put out those horrid counterfeits well be
glad to do so wont we dwight

   certainly my dear he smiled  but
mr smith knows that

  peabody ignored this conversation and
he turned to dwight tompkins with the air
of a funeral director who is asking the mem-
bers of the family to take final leave and
said

   im sorry tompkins but ill have to
arrest you

  the man stiffened

   arrest me-on what charge

  the flicker of a smile played around the
sad countenance of peabody smith

   we wont prefer any charge well
just hold you let us say as a material
witness

  every trace of suavity left tompkins
ill be damned if i stand for such an
outrage i wam you smith that you will
do this thing at your peril

  the detective spoke in even tones

   youd better gather up whatever things
you would like to take to prison with you-
well try to make it as pleasant for you as
possible

  while all this was going on the little wo-
man in the room was playing her part in
the drama in pantomime fashion at the
first mention of arrest she became pale and
started to her feet with a gasp but she
quickly subdued her emotions and sat quiet-
ly and listened to the crossfire of talk be-
tween the two men presently she picked
up a copy of a popular magazine that lay
on the table and began to turn the pages
idly all the while watching the two speakers
from beneath half-closed eyes

  at one time she chanced to look on the
printed page before her the startled yet
shrewd light which came into her eyes in-
dicated that she had made a discovery
quietly she turned down a corner of the
page almost at the same moment she
reached over and picked up a burnt match
stick from an ash tray carelessly she
made marks around part of the matter in
the magazine by this time tompkins and
smith were standing facing one another like
duelists when the detective spoke it was
in that regretful tone to which the other
man was becoming accustomed

   of course he was saying  you are
going to come with us without any resist-
ance

  the women advanced with an elegant
gesture

   if he must go i want to go with him-
it will kill me to be left here alone

  peabody smith gazed thoughtfully into
her glistening eyes which shone like those
of a hurt animal

   im afraid he said finally  that mr
tompkins will have to go alone let us
hope that it may not be for long

  she fought back the unbidden tears and
went over and kissed and embraced tomp-
kins as he left between the two detec-
tives she thrust the magazine into his hand

   heres something to read she mur-
mured with a catch in her voice  and you
will find me here waiting for you

iii

  it was after dwight tompkins had been
placed under lock and key and the two in-
vestigators were in their apartment that tim
burke turned to his superior

   im not on to your game chief but i
should say that you are acting in a pretty
high-handed fashion you havent a shred
of evidence against that fellow and even
if you had hed have the right to get out
on bail under the law you couldnt lock
him up

  peabody stared at his assistant so long
and so earnestly that it made burke ner-
vous but finally the old man spoke and
his words were unanswerable

   but he is locked up isnt he


argosy-allstory weekly

          s all right retorted the other
  but you know-

    tim youre not well was the irrele-
 vant exclamation of the long lean detective

   what do you mean

    i mean was the solemn retort  that
 you are the victim of a pair of bright eyes
 i dont blame you a bit i was that way
 at your age but if youre going to work
 with me youve got to pull yourself to-
 gether

   it sounded very good to talk about work
 but for the next three days peabody smith
 seemed to do everything but labor he
 made his headquarters at the fostoria
 hotel smoked fine cigars attended the thea-
 ter and made himself comfortable general-
 ly he bought all of the morning and
 evening newspapers and went through them
 religiously on the sunday after the ar-
 rest of tompkins the bullet-headed assist-
 ant walked into peabody smiths room only
 to find him almost buried under an ava-
 lanche of sunday papers the floor was
 covered with them and sporting sections
 comic supplements feature pages and news
 sections were lying round as thick as the
 fabled leaves in vallombrosa

   good morning chief exclaimed tim
burke trying hard to hide a feeling of
annoyance over such seeming indolence in
the midst of an important case

   mornin replied peabody without
lifting his eyes from the paper in which his
head was buried

    still improvin your mind i notice
chirped the other with badly concealed im-
patience

    yep was the short response

   tim sat down and waited his own read-
ing was limited to the sporting page and he
never could understand any one wading
through hundreds of pages of the modern
sunday journal he noticed that peabody
was on his last paper apparently he read
them all from beginning to end a per-
son one might say who was a perfect glut-
ton for news he noticed that the old man
was running his eyes in practiced style down
the list of the want ads he could not re-
sist the little quip

    looking for a job as a detective
   peabody did not reply he turned from

 the help wanted columns to
 notices suddenly a loud chuckle came
 from his vicinity he slowly uncurled his
 long legs and rose to his feet he was
 actually smiling as he stood there holding
 the newspaper between his fingers he
 walked over to the window and looked out-
 side it was raining cats and dogs not to
 mention other animals

     its a fine day said peabody with sol-
 emn humor  for a funeral

    say boss exclaimed tim  ill laugh
 if you put me on to the joke

   it no joke just cast your eyes over
 that notice and as he spoke he thrust the
 newspaper into the hands of his assistant
 this is what burke read

    hendricks-on the tenth instant
   thomas a hendricks in the seventieth year
   of his life funeral at twilight this evening
   interment in the family lot at the huntsville
   cemetery friends and relatives are kindly
   requested to omit floral offerings

   while the young man was perusing these
 lines with wrinkled brow the detective had
 gone to the telephone and called up the
 lieutenant of the police station where
 dwight tompkins had been detained he
 had some difficulty in getting the connec-
 tion but presently he was talking to the po-
 lice official 

    yes yes tompkins is the name
 dwight tompkins the man i left with you
 a few days ago you say that he has not
 been permitted to see any one thats
 right thats just what i wanted now
 you are to release him at five oclock this
 afternoon yes let him go without any
 explanation ill be responsible dont for-
 get at five oclock sharp

   tim burke was looking at his yankee
 friend as though he thought he had lost his
 senses he handed him the newspaper

    ive read the death notice what about
 it

 not much except that we are going to
attend that funeral its too bad that floral
offerings are forbidden id like to take a
wreath or the gates ajar or something like
that but the wishes of the family will have
to be observed

  youve ordered the release of tomp-

the adventures of peabody smith



kins said burke with a note of interroga-
tion  what was the use of locking him
up in the first place

   the reasons were entirely psychologi-
cal replied peabody grinning in the most
unabashed fashion  i was making a test
it has been entirely successful

  it was four oclock when the twro men
crowded into a taxicab and the detective
ordered the driver to run out to huntsville
the greenback that was pressed into his
hand assured them of speed in less than
an hour they had reached the town and the
chauffeur was skirting the old-fashioned
cemetery on the edge of the little commu-
nity he was instructed to wait in a se-
cluded spot and then peabody cautiously
led his way toward a comer of a certain plot
it was apart from the graves but the two
men saw that the earth had been disturbed
they had scarcely noticed this when the
chug-chugging of an automobile was heard
in the distance peabody grabbed tim by
the arm and pulled him behind a tree

   keep out of sight he whispered and
dont breathe

  the machine came in view and halted
near the section where the two detectives
were hiding a medium-sized man with a
cap pulled down over his eyes and wearing
green goggles was driving he got out of
the car hurriedly and glanced around him
quickly his eyes lighted on the broken
clay he took off his goggles placed them
in his pocket and lifted his cap

  it was dwight tompkins

  tim burke made a movement as if to go
for him but peabody smith pulled him
back with a grunt of anger after that they
remained there as immovable as statues
the newcomer went to his car and got out
a spade then he took off his coat and go-
ing over to the disturbed plot began to
dig he worked hard and fast and he wrent
deep tim burke thought it was the queer-
est performance he had ever witnessed
presently the spade that tompkins was
using struck some hard substance he
tossed the implement aside and went down
on his hands and knees and reached into
the grave the next moment he was pull-
ing out a metal box he put it under his
arm and started for the car

    	a

   now tim exclaimed peabody  get
that box before he gets away

  they rushed simultaneously in the direc-
tion of the grave digger when tompkins
looked up he was gazing into the muzzle of
a revolver in the hand of the secret service
man

   hands up exclaimed peabody

  the order was obeyed and before tomp-
kins realized what was going on tim burke
had slipped a pair of steel bracelets around
his unresisting wrists after the prisoner
had been placed securely in the car the
detective opened the metal box in it he
found what he had expected-four fine
plates used in the engraving of the thomas
a hendricks counterfeit one-hundred-dol-
lar notes

iv

  that night for the second time dwight
tompkins slept in a prison cell but in the
adjoining compartment little edna tomp-
kins wept as one who is without hope it
was when all of the evidence had been
marshaled and the case was cinched that
tim ventured to ask peabody smith how he
had got the clew that led to the solution
of the mystery

  the old man who was seated in a capa-
cious arm chair slowly uncurled his long
legs reached over for a fresh stogie lit it
and then resumed his former position

   well he said as the smoke ascended
in little ringlets  it all came about through
a flaw in the alibi

   but protested tim  i thought that
was a beautiful alibi-it looked air-tight
to me

   very true sonny but there was one
tiny hole in it and you know that is enough
to sink a battleship he had the back-
ground all right he was in business in
huntsville and was respected by the people
but as an expert engraver he was obsessed
with the idea that he could beat the united
states government at its own game that
if you will pardon me for saying it is a
fatal mistake on the part of any man
counterfeiters have been trying to rival the
bureau of engraving and printing for a
hundred years and they have always failed
and always will fail

    he told the truth when he said that he
had notified the hotel clerk of the alleged
finding of the bogus money he was truth-
ful when he told of inserting the advertise-
ment in the newspaper but it was there
that the fatal flaw disdosed itself he in-
sisted that he picked up the envelope in the
corridor of the hotel just as the electric
lights were going on the records of the
electric light company showed me that the
lights went on at six oclock and the
 ad  in the lost and found column was
handed in at four forty-five that afternoon
one hour and a quarter before the money
was said to have been found the stamp
of the business office on the copy proved
that and it is a well-known fact that this
particular newspaper does not accept adver-
tisements of that kind after five oclock in
the afternoon

    i had caught tompkins in a lie and it
was only necessary to be patient to land
him in the net what i wanted to get
was the plates from which the bank notes
were printed and that took a little strategy
i was positive they would be hidden some-
where and it was that which caused me to
separate the man and the woman if he
was arrested the business of hiding the
plates would fall on her and having done
that she would try to communicate with
him i made sure that they could not see
one another and that no communications
should reach him dwight and edna both
believed that it pays to advertise and for
that reason i directed that he should have
the newspapers sent to him i watched
them too as you know and when that
clever hendricks death notice appeared i

knew that we had the plates from which the
counterfeit notes were printed for as you
know each one of them contains a fine en-
graving of vice president thomas a hen-
dricks

  tim burke was looking at his chief ad-
miringly but he was constrained to make
one criticism

   dont you think you were a bit harsh
with that little woman

  the smile that overspread the counte-
nance of peabody smith made him look like
another man he spoke with deliberation
 tim i admire you for your misplaced
gallantry but i was on to the little lady
from the start when i arrested him you
will recall that she handed him a magazine
to while away the weary hours well she
had turned one of the pages and marked
an article with a burnt match stick 
managed to get a peep at it it was an
essay on success and it said  speech is
silver and silence is golden many a man
has talked himself to death a clever way
to warn him to keep his mouth shut but
it was just what to expect from the woman
who was the brains behind this whole
scheme he made the plates-she did the
rest

   peabody smith relighted his stogie which
had gone out while he was talking and then
he reached for a volume of his favorite
author but as tim burke left the room
he flung a parting remark after him

    the longer you are in the business son
the more you will be convinced that crime
does not pay old josh billings had the
right dope when he declared that honesty
was the best card in the pack

the seal of his baj

  as barlow led the gulab within the
bungalow she drew as a veil a light
a v silk scarf across her face

  upon the floor of the front room a
bearer head buried in yards of pink cotton
cloth-his pugree-lay fast asleep

  as barlow raised a foot to touch the
sleeper in the ribs the girl drew him back
put the tips of her fingers to her lips and
pointed toward the bedroom door

  barlow shook his head the flickering
flame of the wick in an iron oil lamp that
rested in a niche of the wall exaggerating
to ferocity the frown that topped his eyes

  but bootea pleaded with a mute salaam
and raising her lips to his ears whispered

 not because of what is not permitted-
not because of bootea-please

  with an arm he swept back the beaded
tendrils of a hanging door curtain the girl
glided to the darkness of the room and
barlow lifting from its niche the iron lamp
followed within she pointed to the door
that lay open and barlow half in rebellion
softly closed it as he turned he saw that
she had dropped from their holding cords
the heavy brocaded silk curtains of the
window

  his limbs were numb from the long ride
with the weight of the girls body across his
thighs he was tired he was mentally dis-
tressed over the messengers he had failed
to locate and this the almost forced intru-
sion of bootea into his bedroom the closed
door and the curtained windows her do-

mg was just another turn of the kaleido-
scope with its bits of broken glass of a
nightmare he dropped wearily into a
big cane-bottomed hindu chair saying
 little wilted rose cuddle up on that divan
among the cushions and rest while you tell
me why we sit in purdah

  the girl dragged a cushion from the
 divan and placing it on the floor beside his
 chair sat on it curling her feet beneath her
 knees

  barlow groaned inwardly if his mind
 had not been so lethargic because of the
 things that weighted it like the leaden soles
 upon a divers boots he would have roused
 himself to say  look here a chap cant
 pull a girl who is as sweet as a flower and
 as trusting as a babe out of trouble and
 then make bazaar love to her he cant
 do it if hes any sort of a chap all this
 was casually in his mind but he let his
 tired eyes droop and his hand that hung
 over the teakwood arm of the chair rested
 upon the girls shoulder

    bootea will soon go so that the sahib
 may sleep for he is tired she said  but
 first there is something to be said and i
 have come close to the sahib because men
 not alone whisper in the dark but they
 listen

   the hand that rested on booteas shoul-
 der lifted to her cheek and strong fingers
 caressed its oval

    would the sahib sleep and would his
 mind rest if he knew where the two who
 rode are

  barlow sat bolt upright in the chair
 roused the lethargy gone as if he had
 poured raw whisky down his throat and
 he was glad the closed door and the drawn
 curtains were not now things of debase-
 ment curious that he should care what
 this little hindu maid was like but he did
 his hand now clasped the girls wrist it al-
 most hurt in its tenseness

   yes gulab -and he subdued his
 voice- tell me if you know

   they are dead upon the road beyond
 where you saved bootea

    why didnt you tell me this before

    it was too late sahib and if you had
 gone there they would have killed you

   who

     that i cannot tell

     you must gulab

     no bootea will not

    barlow stared angrily into the big eyes
 that were lifted to his that though they
 lingered in soft loving upon his face told
 him that she would not tell that she would
 die first even as he would have given his
 life if he had been captured by tribesmen
 and asked to betray his fellowmen as the
 price of liberty

   he threw himself back wearily in the
 chair  why tell me this now-to mock
 me to exult he said reproach in his voice

     but it is the message sahib that is
 more than the life of a sepoy is it not
 again he sat up  why do you say this
 -do you know where it is

   she drew from beneath her bodice the
 sandal soles saying  these are from the
 feet of the messenger who is dead the one
 the sahib beat over the head with his pistol
 dropped them-and he was carrying them
 for a purpose the sahib knows perhaps
 the secret way of this land

    in the girls hand was clasped the knife
 from her girdle and she tendered it hilt
 first  bootea knows not if they are of
 value the leather soles but if the sahib
 would open them then if there are eyes
 that watch the curtains are drawn

    barlow revivified stimulated by hope
 seized the knife and ran its sharp point
 around the stitching of the soles between
 the double leather of one lay a thin strong
 parchmentlike paper

    he gave a cry of exultation as unfold-
 ing it he saw the seal of his raj his cry
 was a gasp of relief almost the shatter-
 ment of his career had lain in that worn dis-
 colored sole and disaster to his raj if it had
 fallen into the hands of the conspirators

    in an ecstacy of relief he sprang to his
 feet and lifting bootea clasped her in his
 arms smothering her face with kisses
 whispering  gulab you are my pre-
 server you are the sweetest rose that ever
 bloomed

 he felt the pound of her heart against
his breast and her eyes mirrored a happi-
ness that caused him to realize that he was
going too far-drifting into troubled waters
that threatened destruction the girls
caste



soul had risen to her eyes and looked out
as though he were a god

  as if bootea sensed the same impending
evil she pushed barlow from her and sank
back to the cushion her face shedding its
radiancy

  cursing himself for the impetuous out-
burst barlow slumped into the chair

   gulab he said presently  my gov-
ernment gives reward for loyalty and serv-
ice

    bootea has had full reward the girl
answered

  he continued  we had talk on the
road about the pindaris what did they who
whisper in the dark say

   that the chief amir khan has gath-
ered an army and they fear that because
of em english bribe he will attack the mah-
rattas so the dewan has brought men
from karowlee to go into the camp of the
pindaris in disguise and slay the chief for
a reward

  this information coming from bootea
was astounding neither resident hodson
nor captain barlow had suspected that
there had been a leak

   and was there talk of this message
from the british to- barlow checked

   to the sahib bootea asked  not
of the message but it was whispered that
one would go to the pindari camp to talk
with amir khan and perhaps it was the
sahib they meant and perhaps they knew
he waited for orders from the government

  then suddenly it flashed upon barlow
that because of this he had been marked
the foul riding in the game of polo that so
nearly put him out of commission-it had
been deliberately foul he knew that but
he had attributed it to a personal anger on
the part of the mahratta officer bred of
rivalry in the game and the fantastical hate
of an individual hindu for an englishman

   now that a message has come will the
sahib go to the pindari camp bootea per-
sisted

  why do you ask gulab

   not in the way of treachery but be-
cause the sahib is now like a god and be-
cause i may again be of service for those
who will slay amir khan will also slay the
sahib

   gulab-

  barlows voice was drowned by yells of
terror in the outer room

   thieves thieves have broken in to
rob and they have stolen my lamp
chowkidar chowkidar wtake son of a
pig

  it was the bearer who suddenly wak-
ened by some noise had in the dark groped
for his lamp and found it missing

   heavens  the captain exclaimed
 now the cook house will be empty-the
servants will come he rubbed a hand
perplexedly over his forehead  quick
gulab you must hide

  he swung open a wooden door between
his room and a bedroom next within he
said  theres a bed and you must sleep
here till daylight then i will have the chcrua-
kidar take you to where you wish to go
you couldnt go in the dark anyway bar
the door you will be quite safe dont be
frightened he touched her cheek with
his fingers  salaam little girl then
going out he opened the door leading to
the room of clamor exclaiming angrily

 you fool why do you scream in your
dreams

   god be thanked it is the sahib
the bearer flopped to his knees and put his
hands in abasement upon his masters feet

  jungwa had rushed into the room staff
in hand at the outcry now he stood
glowering indignantly upon the groveling
bearer

   it is the opium sahib he declared

 this fool spends all his time in the bazaar
smoking with people of ill repute if the
presence will but admonish him with the
whip our slumbers will not again be dis-
turbed

   the bearer running true to the tenets of
native servants put up a flat denial

   sahib you who are my father and my
mother be not angry for i have not slept

i observed the sahib pass but as he spoke
not i thought he had matters of import
upon his mind and wished not to be dis-
turbed

  a liar-by mother gunga the
chowkidar prodded him in the ribs with the
end of his staff and turning in disgust
passed out


argosy-allstory weekly

   come you fool barlow commanded
returning to his room and sitting down
wearily upon the bed held up a leg

   the bearer knelt and in silence stripped
the puttees from his masters limbs unlaced
the shoes and pulled off the breeches

  when barlow had slipped on the pyjamas
handed him he said  tell the chowkidar
to come to me at his waking from the first
call of the crows

chapter xiii

damn the thing

an omen of dire import all thugs be-
lieve is to hear the cry of a kite be-
tween midnight and dawn to hear
it before midnight does not matter for the
sleeper in turning over smothers the im-
pending disaster beneath his body but
captain barlow had put up no such de-
fense if evil hung over him for when the
cliowkidar stood outside the door calling
softly captain sahib captain sahib
barlow lay just as he had flopped on the
bed his tiredness having held him as one
dead

  gently the soft voice of the chowkidar
pulled him back out of his nirvana of non-
existance and he called sleepily  what
is it

   it is jungwa the wratchman answered
 and i have received the sahibs order to
come at this hour

  then barlow remembered he swung his
feet to the floor saying  come

  when the watchman had walked out of
his sandals to approach in his bare feet
the captain said  is your tongue still to
remain in your mouth jungwa or has it
been made sacrifice to the knife for the sin
of telling in the cookhouse tales of your
ahib and last night

   no sahib i have not spoken i am a
meena of the ossary jat in jaipur we
guard the treasury and the zenanna of the
rajah and it is our chief who puts the tika
upon the forehead of the maharaja when
he ascends to the thrown think you then
sahib that an ossary would betray a
trust

barlow fixed the lean saffron-hued face

with a searching look and muttered
 damned if i dont believe the old chap
is straight i think it is true he said
 shut the door then he continued
 the one who came last night is in the
next room and you must take her out
through the bathroom door for there is
cover of the crotons and oleanders and
then to the road acquire a gharry and go
with her to where she directs you

    salaam sahib your servant will obey
and as to the chota hazri sahib

   by jove right you are jungwa for
barlow had forgotten that-the little
breakfast as it was called

   then he ran his fingers through his hair
to send the gulab off without even a cup
of tea was one thing to admit the bearer
to know of her presence was another

  the wily old watchman sensed what was
passing in his masters mind and he haz-
arded diplomatically  if the one is of
high caste she will not eat what is brought
by the bearer who is of the sudra caste but
from the hands of a meena none but the
brahmin pundits refuse food

  barlow laughed indeed the grizzled one
had perception-he was an accomplice in
the plot of secrecy

  good eggs and toast and tea de-
mand plenty-say your sahib is hungry be-
cause of a long ride and nothing to eat
but hurry i hear the  seven sisters 
crows calling to sleepers that the sun is
here with its warmth

  then the bearer entered but barlow or-
dered him awav saving  sit without till i
call

  as he slipped into breeches and brown
riding boots he cursed softly the entangle-
ment that had thrust upon him this thing
of ill flavor of course the watchman even
if he did keep his mouth shut which would
be a miracle in that land of bazaar gossip
would have but one opinion of why bootea
had spent the night in the bungalow but
if barlow squared this by speaking of a
secret mission that would be a knowledge
that could be exchanged for gold per-
haps not all servants were spies but there
were always spies among servants

   damn the thing  he muttered but he
was helpless the old man would give no
caste



sign of what no doubt was in his mind
he would hold that leathery face in placid
acquiescence in prevalent moral vagary

  then he tapped lightly on the wooden
door calling softly bootea bootea
when it was opened he said  food is
coming gulab a man of caste brings it
and it is but eggs from which no life has
been taken so you may eat then the
chowkidar will go with you

  jungwa brought the breakfast and put
it down saying  i will wait sahib outside
the bathroom door

   here is money-ten rupees for what-
ever is needed be courteous to the lady
for she is not a nautchni

   the sahib would entertain none such
the chowkidar answered with a grave
salaam

   damn the thing barlow groaned

chapter xiv

shes the keynote

an hour later barlow mounted on a
stalky cabuli polo pony rode to the
residency happy over the papers in
his pocket but troubling over how he
could explain their possession and keep the
girl out of it to even mention the gulab
unless he fabricated a story would let es-
cape the night ride and no doubt in the
perversity of things resident hodson
would want to know where she was and
where he had taken her and insist on hav-
ing her produced for an official inquisition
the resident a machine would sacrifice
a native woman without a tremor to the
official gods

  barlow could formulate no plausible
method he could not hide the death of the
two native messengers and would simply
have to take the stand of  here is this
message from his excellency and as to
how i came by it is of as little importance
as an order from the war office regulating
the color of thread that attaches buttons to
a tunic

  he turned the cabuli up the wide drive
that led to the residency the big white
walled bungalow in which hodson lived
and shook his riding crop toward elizabeth

who was reading upon the veranda he
swung from the saddle and held out his
hand to the girl saying cherrily  hello
beth didnt you ride this morning or
are you back early

  the novel seemed to require support of
the girls hand or she had not observed that
of the caller her face always emotion-
less was repellent in its composure as she
said  father is just inside in his office
with a native and i fancy its one of the
usual dark things of mystery for he asked
me to sit here by the window that he might
have both air and privacy im to warn off
all who might stand here against the wall
with an open ear

   ill pull a chair up and chat with you
till hes-

   no captain barlow barlow winced
at this formality  father im sure wants
you in this matter in fact i think a chu-
prassi is on his way now to your bungalow
with the residents salaams

   im ghastly tired beth ill come back
to you said barlow

   yes india is enervating she com-
mented in a flat tone

  barlow had a curious impression that
the girls gray eyes had turned yellow as
she made this observation

   ah captain glad youve come hod-
son said rising and extending a hand across
a flat-topped desk  im-im-well pull
a chair this is one ajeet singh and he
drooped slightly his thin lean bald head
toward the bagree chief who stood stiff and
erect one arm in a sling

  at this ajeet knowing it for an informal
introduction put his hand to his forehead
and said  salaam sahib

   tulwar play sir and an appeal for pro-
tection to the british eh and barlow in-
dicated the arm in the sling

  still speaking in english hodson said
 as to that -he pursed his thin lips-
something dreadful has happened this
man has been mixed up in a decoity and
has come for protection he wants to turn
approver

   the usual thing when these cut-
throats are likely to be caught they turn
judas to save their own necks they offer
a sacrifice of their comrades


argosy-allstory weekly

   yes the resident affirmed  but im
glad he came perhaps we had better just
sit tight and let him go on-hes only nicely
started ive practically promised him
that if what he confesses is of service to
his excellencys government i will give him
our conditional pardon and use what in-
fluence i have with the peshwa but i
fancy that old baji rao is mixed up in it
himself

  he turned to the decoit  commence
again and tell the truth and if i believe
you may be given protection from the brit-
ish but as to sindhia i have no power to
protect his criminals

  the decoit cleared his throat and began
 i ajeet singh hold allegiance to the
rajah of karowlee and am chief of the
bagrees who are decoits

  the resident held up his hand  have
patience he rose and took from a little
cabinet a small alabaster figure of kali
which he placed upon the table saying in
english to barlow  when these decoits
confess to be made approvers half of the
confession is lies for to swear them on our
bible is as little use as playing a tin
whistle if hes a bagree this is his goddess
in hindu he said  ajeet singh if you
are a bagree decoit you are in the protec-
tion of bhowanee and you make oath to
her

   yes sahib

   this is bhowanee-that is your name
for kali-and with obeisance to her make
oath that you will tell the truth

   yes sahib it is the proper way

  proceed

  the jamadar with the fingers of his two
hands clasped to his forehead in obeisance
declared  if i ajeet singh tell that
which is not trua mother kali may thy
wrath fall upon me and my family

  then hodson shifted the black goddess
and let it remain upon a corner of his table
surmising that the sight of it would help

   speak now the resident commanded
and the jamadar proceeded

   dewan sewlal sent to rajah karowlee
for men for a mission and whether it was
in the letter he sent that thugs should come
i know not but in our party were thugs
and that led to why i am here

    what is the difference ajeet hod-
son asked sharply  you are a decoit who
robs and kills and thugs kill and rob you
are both disciples of this murderous crea-
ture kali

   we who are decoits while we make
offerings to kali are not thugs they have
a chief mission of murder while we have
but a desire to gain for our families from
the rich the thugs came in this wise
sahib bhowanee created them from the
sweat of her arms and gave to them her
tooth for a pick-ax which is their emblem
a rib for a knife and the hem of her gar-
ment for a noose to strangle the hem of
her sacred garment was yellow and white
and the roomal that they strangle with is
yellow and white they are thugs sahib
and we are decoits

   a fine distinction sir and barlow
laughed

   proceed hodson commanded

   we were told by the dewan to go to
the camp of the pindaris and bring back
the head of amir khan

  lovely barlow muttered softly but
hodson started a slight rouge crept over
his pale face and he said  by gad this
grows interesting my dear captain

   absolutely oriental barlow added
then when their voices had stilled ajeet
continued  but hunsa had ridden with
the pindari chief and he knew that he was
well guarded and that it would be impos-
sible to bring his head in a basket so we re-
fused to go on this mission the dewan
was angry and would not give us food or
pay through hunsa the dewan sent word
that we must obtain our living in the way
of our profession which is decoity

   i wonder barlow queried

  but hodson nodding his head said
 quite possible and also quite probable
that the dear avaricious dewan would
claim a share of the loot if it were of value
jewels especially he addressed ajeet
 i have nothing to do with this i am not
sindhia

   true sahib bahadur but a decoity
was made upon a merchant on the road
and he and his men were killed and also
two english sowars were slain

  by heavens the cool trained
caste



bloodless machine that was a british resi-
dent at a court of intrigue was startled
out of his composure his eyes flashed to
those of barlow

   but the captain knowing all this before-
hand had an advantage and he showed no
sign of trepidation

  then the thin drawn face of the resi-
dent was flattened out by control and he
commanded the decoit to talk on

    i tried to save the two sepoys and one
was a sergeant but i was stricken down
with a wound and it was in the way of
treachery

  ajeet laid a hand upon his wounded
shoulder saying  when the two sepoys
rode suddenly out of the night into our
camp where there in the moonlight lay
the bodies of the merchant and his men
the bagree were afraid lest the two should
make report they rushed upon the two
riders and it was then that i was wounded

 would have been killed but for this pro-
tection and ajeet rubbed affectionately
the beautiful strong shirt of mail that en-
wrapped his torso

   and observe sahib the wound is from
behind which is a wound of treachery as
i rushed to the two and cried to them to
be gone a ball from a short gun in the
hands of some bagree smote me upon the
shoulder and this -he again touched the
shirt of mail- and my shoulder blade
turned it from my heart even then hunsa
thought i was dead and he was in league
with the dewan to obtain for xana sahib
a girl of my household who is called the
gulab because she is as beautiful as the
moon

  at this statement barlow knew why the
man he had beaten with his pistol had tried
to seize the gulab it was startling the
leg that had rested across a knee clamped
noisily to the floor and a smothered
damn escaped from his lips what a
devilish complicated thing it was

  ajeet resumed  hunsa rushed to
where the gulab was in hiding and helped
the men who had been sent by xana sahib
to steal her then he came back to our
camp saying that many men had beaten
him and that he had been forced to flee

  at this vagary barlow smiled

   what of the two soldiers hodson
asked  why were they here in this land
and at the camp of the bagrees

    i know not sahib

   were the bodies robbed by your men
-they would be-did they find papers that
would indicate the two were messengers
and the residents bloodless fingers that
clasped a pen were trembling with the sup-
pression of the awful interest he strove to
hide for he knew as well as barlow what
their mission was

   yes sahib they were stripped and the
bodies thrown in the pit with the others
eight rupees were taken but as to papers
i know nothing

   where is the woman you call the
gulab

   she will be in the hands of nana
sahib ajeet answered  and because of
that i have come to confess so your honor
will save my life from him for he will
make accusation that i was the chief of
those who killed the soldiers of the british
and that the sahib will cause to have re-
turned to me the gulab

  the resident took from a drawer a form
and his pen scratched irritably at blanks
here and there he tossed it over to bar-
low saying  im going to give this decoit
this provisional pardon perhaps it will nail
him what he has confessed is of value
you translate this to him while i think i
cant make mistakes-i must not

  captain barlow read to ajeet the par-
don which was the form adopted by the
british government to be issued to certain
thugs and decoits who became spies called
approvers for the british

      you ajeet singh are promised exemption
   from the punishment of death and transporta-
   tion beyond seas for all past offenses and
   such reasonable indulgence as your services
   may seem to merit and may be compatible
   with your safe custody on condition first
   that you make full confession of all the de-
   coities in which you have been engaged sec-
   ond that you mention truly the names of all
   your associates in these crimes and assist to
   the utmost of your power in their arrest and
   conviction if you act contrary to these con-
   ditions-conceal any of the circumstances of
   the decoities in which you have been en-
   gaged-screen any of your friends- attempt
   to escape-or accuse any innocent nenaw-


argosy-allstory weekly

  you shall be considered to have forfeited
  thereby all claims to such exemption and
  indulgence

  when the captain had finished inter-
preting this the resident passed it to the
decoit saying  this will protect you from
the british you are now bound to the
british and i want you to bring me any
papers that may have been found upon the
two soldiers bring here this woman the
gulab if you can find her go now
when ajeet with a deep salaam had
gone from the room hodson threw himself
back in his chair wearily and sighed then
he said a woman the jamadar was
lying-all that stuff about nana sahib
theres been some deviltry theyve used
this woman to trap the messengers thats
india its the papers they were after
they must have known they were coming
and theyve hidden the woman weve got
to lay hands upon her captain-shes the
keynote

chapter xv

 i can trust no one

barlow had waited until the decoit
would have gone before showing the
papers that were in his pocket be-
cause it was an advantage that the enemy
should think them lost he was checked
now as he put a hand in his pocket to pro-
duce them by the entrance of elizabeth
and he fancied there was a sneer on her
thin lips

   father she said as she leaned against
the desk one hand on its teakwood top
 ive been listening to the handsome leader
of thieves i couldnt help hearing him i
fancy that captain barlow could tell you
just where this woman the gulab who is
as beautiful as the moon is im sure he
could bring her here-if he would

  the captains fingers unclasped from the
papers in his pocket and now were beating
a tattoo on his knee

  elizabeth the father gasped do
you know what you are saying his cold
gray eyes were wide with astonishment
 did you hear all of ajeet singhs story

   yes all of it

   its your friend nana sahib whom
you treat as if he were an englishman and
to be trusted that knows where this woman

is elizabeth

  a cynical laugh issued from the girls
lips that were so like her fathers in their
unsympathetic contour  yes one may
trust men but a womans eyes are given
her to prevent disaster from this trust
which is so natural to the deceivable sex

   elizabeth you do not know what
you are saying-what the inference would
be

    ask captain barlow if he doesnt know
all about the gulabs movements

  the resident pushed irritably some pa-
pers on his desk and turning in his chair
asked  can you explain this captain-
what it is all about

  there were ripples of low temperature
chilling the base of barlows skull  i
cant explain it-its beyond me he an-
swered doggedly

   the girl turned upon him with ferocity
 dont lie captain barlow a british
officer does not lie to his superior

   hush beth the father pleaded

   dont you know captain barlow
the girl demanded  that this woman the
gulab is one who uses her beauty to be-
tray men even sahibs

   no i dont know that miss hodson
i saw her dance at nana sahibs and ive
heard ajeets statement i dont know
anything evil of the girl and i dont be-
lieve it

   a mans sense of honor where a woman
is concerned-lie to protect her i have
no illusions about the sahibs in india she
continued in a tone that was devilish in
its cynicism  but i did think that a brit-
ish officer would put his duty to his king
above the shielding of a nautch girl
elizabeth hodson rose and put a
hand upon the girls arm  do you realize
that you are doing a dreadful thing-that
you are impeaching captain barlows honor
as a soldier

  barlows face was white and hodson
was trembling but the girl stood a merci-
less cold triumph in her face  i do real-
ize that father for the girl i care noth-
ing nor for captain barlows intrigue with
caste



such but i am the daughter of the man
who represents the british raj here

   barlow knowing the full deviltry of this
high protestation knowing that elizabeth
imperious dominating cold-blooded was
knifing a supposed rival-a rival not in
love for he fancied elizabeth was in-
capable of love-felt a surge of indignation

    for gods sake elizabeth what impos-
sible thing has led you to believe that cap-
tain barlow has anything to do with this
girl the father asked

    ill tell you the matter is too grave for
me to remain silent this morning i rode
early-earlier than usual for i wanted to
pick up the captain before he had started
as i turned my mount into his compound
i saw coming from the back of the bunga-
low this native woman and she was being
taken away by his chowkidar she had
just come out some back door of the bunga-
low for from the drive i could see the open
space that lay between the bungalow and
the servants quarters

  hodson dropped a hand to the teakwood
desk it looked inadequate thin bloodless
blue veins mapped its white back  you
are mistaken elizabeth im sure-

    no father i was not mistaken there
are not many native girls like the gulab
ill admit as she turned a clump of cro-
tons she saw me sitting my horse and drev
a gauze scarf across her face to hide it i
waited and asked the chowkidar if it were
his daughter and the old fool said it was
the wife of his son and the girl that he
claimed was his sons wife had the iron
bracelet of a hindu widow on her arm
and the gulab wears one-i saw it the
night she danced

   a ghastly hush fell upon the three bar-
low was moaning inwardly  poor boo-
tea hodson fingers pressed to both
temples was trying to think this was all
the mistaken outburst of an angry woman
the strong-faced honest fearless soldier
sitting in the chair could not be a traitor-
could not be

  suddenly something went awry in the in-
flamed chambers of elizabeths mind as if
an electric current had been abruptly shut
off she hesitated she had meant to say
more but there was a staggering vacuity

  with an effort she grasped a wavering
thing of tangibility and said  im going
now father to give the keys to the butler
for breakfast you can question captain
barlow

  elizabeth turned and left the room her
feet were like dependents servants that she
had to direct to carry her on her way she
did not call to the butler but went to her
room closed the door flung herself on the
bed face downward and sobbed tears
that scalded splashed her cheeks and she
beat passionately with clenched fist at the
pillow beating as she knew at her heart
it was incredible this thing her feelings

   i dont care-i dont care-i never
did she gasped

  but she did and only now knew it

   i was right-im glad-id say it
again 

  but she would not and she knew it she
knew that barlow could not be a traitor
she knew it it was just a battered new
love asserting itself

  and below in the room the two men for
a little sat not speaking of the ghoulish
thing barlow had drawn the papers from
his pocket he passed them silently across
the table

  hodson almost mechanically had
stretched a hand for them and when they
were opened and he saw the seal and real-
ized what they were some curious guttural
sound issued from his lips as if he had
waked in affright from a nightmare he
pulled a drawer of the desk open took out
a cheroot and lighted it then he com-
menced to speak slowly droppingly as one
speaks who has suddenly been detected in a
crime he put a flat hand on the papers
holding them to the desk and it was eliza-
beth he spoke of at first as if the thing un-
der his palm that meant danger to an em-
pire was subservient

   barlow my boy he said  im old
im tired

  the captain looking into the drawn face
had a curious feeling that hodson was at
least a hundred there was a floaty won-
derment in his mind why the fifty-five-
years service retirement rule had not been
enforced in the colonels case then he
heard the others words


argosy-allstory weekly

   ive had but two gods barlow-the
british raj and elizabeth thats since her
mother died in a little a few years more

i	will retire with just enough to live on plus

my pension-perhaps in france where its
cheap and then ill still have two gods-
elizabeth and the one god and captain
somehow i had hoped that you and eliza-
beth would hit it off but im afraid shes
made a mistake

  barlow had been following this with half
his receptivity for though he fought
against it the memory of bootea-gentle
trusting radiating love warmth-cried out
against the bitter unfeminity of the girl
who had stabbed his honor and his clean-
ness the black figure of kali still rested
on the table and somehow the evil lines in
the face of the goddess suggested the vin-
dictiveness that had played about the thin
lips of his accuser

  and the very plea the father was mak-
ing was reacting it was this that he bar-
low was rich that a chance death or two
would make him lord barradean was the
attraction-not love a girl couldnt be in
love with a man and strive to break him

  hodson had taken up the papers and
was again scanning them mistily

   they were on the murdered messenger
-he was killed wasnt he barlow

   yes

   and has any native seen these papers
captain

   no i cut them from the soles of the
sandals the messenger wore myself sir

   that is all then captain we have
them back-i may say thank god he
stood up and holding out his hand added
 thank you captain i dont want to
know anything about the matter-im too
much machine now to measure rainbows-
fancy i should wear a strip of red tape as
a tie

  if you will listen sir-there is another
matter that i want to put right your
daughter did see the gulab but because
she had brought me the sandals and you
can take an officers word for it that the
gulab is not what elizabeth believes

   captain i have lived a long time in
india too long to be led away by quick im-
pressions as unfortunately elizabeth was

ive outlived my prejudices when the
mhowa tree blooms i can take glorious
pleasure from its gorgeous fragrant flowers
and not quarrel with its leafless limbs
when the pipal and the neem glisten with
star flowers and sweeten the fetid night air
it matters nothing to me that the natives
believe evil gods home in the branches i
know that even a cobra tries to get out of
my way if ill let him and i know that the
natives have beauty in their natures-one
gets to almost love them as children so
my dear captain when you tell me that the
gulab rendered you and me and the british
raj this tremendous service and add quite
unnecessarily that shes a good girl i be-
lieve it all we need never bring it up again
elizabeth has just made a mistake and
barlow men axe always forgiving mis-
takes of women where their feelings are
concerned-they must-that is one of the
proofs of their strength but these -and
he patted the papers lovingly- well they
are rather like a reprieve brought at the
eleventh hour to a man who is to be exe-
cuted were put in a difficult position
though to pass over in silence the killing
of tw o soldiers would end only in the house
of commons somebody would rise in his
place and want to know why it had been
hushed up but to take action to create
a stir would give rise to a suspicion of the
existence of this

  hodson rose from his chair and paced
the floor one hand clasped to his forehead
his small gray eyes carrying a dream-look
as though he were seeking an occult en-
lightenment then he sat down wearily and
spoke as if interpreting something that had
been whispered him

   yes barlow this decoit has been seized
by the nana sahib lot his life was for-
feit and theyve offered him his life back
to come here and turn approver-to be-
come a spy not for us but as a spy on us
for them ajeet would know that informa-
tion of his coming tome would be carried
to them by spies-the spies are always
with me-and his life wouldnt be worth
two annas i gave him that pardon be-
cause we have no power to seize him here
but it will make them think that we have
fallen into the trap they might even be-
caste



lieve-wily and suspicious as they are-
that what he gleans here is the truth

   theres a curious efficacy barlow in
what i might call an affectation of sim-
plicity you know those stupid heavy-
headed crocodiles in that big pool of the
nerbudda below the marble gorge and how
theyll take nearly an hour wallowing and
sidling up to a mud bank before they crawl
out to bask in the sun but just show the
tip of your helmet above a rock and theyre
gone thats perhaps what i mean as
we might say back in dear old london this
wily rajput thinks he has pulled my leg

   i think colonel that you are dead onto
his wicket

   well then the thing to do is to emu-
late the mugger but this -hodson lifted
the paper and he grew crisp incisive his
gray eyes blued like temper purpling pol-
ished steel- weve got to act-theyve got
to be delivered and soon

   i am ready sir

   its a most dangerous mission

   pardon sir

   sorry captain i was just thinking
aloud-musing forgive me perhaps when
one likes a young man he lets the paternal
spirit come in where it doesnt belong im
sorry theres a trusty patan here who
could go with you hodson continued

 and this side of his own border he is abso-
lutely to be trusted i have my doubts if
any patan can be relied upon by us across
the border

   i will go alone barlow said quietly
then his strong white teeth showed in a
smile  you know the moslem saying
colonel that ten dervishes can sleep on one
blanket but a kingdom can only hold one
king i dont mean about the honor of it
but it will be easier for me i went alone
through the maris tribe when we wanted
to know what the trouble was that threat-
ened up above the bolan and i had no dif-
ficulty you know sir the playful name
the chaps have given me for years

   yes-the  patan -ive heard it

   i make a good musselman-scarce
need any make-up im so dark i can
rattle off the namaz-daily prayer-and
sing the moonakib-the hymn of the fol-
lowers of the prophet

   yes hodson said his words coming
slowly out of a deep think  there will be
patans in the pindari camp in fact pin-
dari is an all-embracing name having little
of nationality about it rajputs bundoolas
patans men of oudh sindies-men who
have the lust of battle and loot all flock to
the pindari chief yes its a good idea
captain the disguise not only for an un-
noticed entrance to the camp but to escape
a waylaying by nana sahibs cutthroats
 yes colonel from what i have learned
-from the gulab it was sir-the dewan
has an inkling that i am going on a mis-
sion and if i rode as myself the king might
lose an officer and officers cost pounds in
the making

  the resident toyed with the papers on
his desk his brow wrinkled from a debate
going on behind it he rose and grasping
the black kali carried it back to the cab-
inet saying  that devilish thing so sug-
gestive of what we are ahvays up against
here makes me shiver

  then he sat dowm adding  captain
there is another important matter connected
with this the rana of udaipur is being
stripped of every rupee by holkar and
sindhia they take turn about at him hol-
kar is up there now where we have chased
him-threatened to sack udaipur unless he
were paid seventy lacs-seven million
rupees-the accursed thief we have man-
aged to get an envoy to the rana with a
view to having him and the other smaller
rulers of mewar join forces with us to
crush forever the mahratta power-drive
them out of mewar for all time the raj-
puts are a brave lot-men of high thought
and it is too bad to have these accursed
cutthroats bleeding to death such a race
if the rana would sign this paper also as
an assurance of friendship to be shown the
pindari chief it would help greatly

   i understand colonel you wish me to
get that from the rana

    yes captain and i may say that if you
can get through with all this there will be no
question about your majority you might
even go higher up than major

   by jove as to that my dear colonel
this trip is just good sport-i love it less
danger than playing polo with these rotters


argosy-allstory weekly

 ill swing over to udaipur first-its just
 west of the pindari camp-been there once
 before on a little pow-wow-then ill switch
 back to amir khan

    i wish you luck captain but be care-
 ful if we can feel sure that this horde of
 pindaris are not hovering on our armys
 flank like the russians hovered on na-
 poleons in the moscow affair it will be a
 great thing-you will have accomplished a
 wonderful thing

    right you are sir barlow exclaimed
blithely the stupendous task for it was
that toniced him he was like a sportsman
that had received news of a tiger within
killing distance he rose and stretched
out his hand for the paper saying  ive
got a job of cobbling to do-ill put this
between the soles of my sandal as it was
carried before-its the safest place really
to-morrow ill become an apostate an af-
ghan and ill be busy for ive got to do
it all myself i can trust no one with a
dark skin

   not even the gulab i fear captain
no one ever knows when a woman will be
swayed by some mental transition he
was thinking of elizabeth

    youre right colonel barlow an-
swered  i fancy i could trust the gulab
-but i wont

chapter xvi

it is bootea sahib

captain barlow had been through
a busy day the very fact that all he
did in preparation for his journey to
the pindari camp had been done with his
own hands held under water out of sight
had increased the strain upon him

   in india in the usual routine of matters
 a staff of ten servants form a composite
 second self to a sahib-to hand him his
 boots and lace them to lay out his clothes
 and hold them while slipped into to bring
 a cheroot or a peg of whisky a syce to
 bring the horse and rub a towel over the
 saddle-to hold the stirrup even for the
 lifted foot and trotting behind guard the
 horse when the sahib makes a call a man
 to go here and there with a note or to post

 a letter a servant to whisk away a plate
 and replenish the crystal glass with pearl-
 beaded wine without sign from the drinker
 and appear like a bidden ghost clad in
 speckless white silent and impassive of
 face behind his masters chair at the table
 when he dines out-everything in fact be-
 yond the mental whirl of the brain to be
 arranged by one or other of the ten

   but this day barlow had been like a
 man throwing detectives off his trail not
 one of his servants must suspect that he
 contemplated a ip-no not just that for
 the captain had intimated casually to the
 butler that he ould go soon to satara

   thus it had been arranged secretly that
 he would ride from his bungalow as captain
 barlow and leave the city as ayub alii an
 afghan

   perhaps barlow was overtired that curi-
 ous knotted condition of the nerves through
 overstrain that rasps a mans mental fiber
 beyond the narcotic of sleep and yet holds
 him in a hectic state of half unconscious-
 ness he counted camels-long strings of
 bubbling complaining beasts short legged
 stout shaggy desert ships such as mer-
 chants of kabul used to carry their dried
 fruits-figs and dates and pomegranates
 and the wondrous flavored sirdar melon-
 wending across the sind desert of floating
 white sand to rajasthan

   once a male tickled to frenzy by the
 caress of a females velvet lips upon his
 rump with a hoarse bubbling scream
 wheeled suddenly snapping the thin lead
 cord that reached from the tail of the camel
 in front to the button in his nostril and
 charged the lady in an exuberance of af-
 fection with a full broadside thrust from
 his chest that bowled her over where she
 lay among the fragments of two huge
 broken burned clay gumlas that filled
 with water had been lashed to her sides

   barlow sat up at this startling tumult
 that was the outcome of his slipping a little
 into slumber he threw his head back on
 the pillow with a smothered damn

   his bed had creaked and an answering
echo as if something had slipped or slid
perhaps the sole of a bare foot on the
fibrous floor matting at the window fell
upon his senses turning bis face toward
caste



the sound he waited eyes trying to pierce
the gloom and ear attuned he almost
cried out in alarm as something floated
through the dark from the window and fell
with a soft thud upon his face he brushed
at the something-perhaps a bat or a liz-
ard or a snake-with his hand and received
a sharp prick a little dart of pain in a
thumb he sprang from the bed lighted
the wick that floated in the iron lamp and
discovered that the thing of dread was a
rose its petals red against the white sheet

  he knew who must have thrown the
rose and almost wished that it had been
a chance missile even a snake but he put
the lamp down passed into the bathroom
and unbarring the wooden door called
softly  who is it

  from the cover of an oleander a slight
girlish form rose up and came to the door
saying  it is bootea sahib do not be
angry there is something to be said

  by the arm he led her within and bid-
ding her wait passed to the bedroom and
drew the heavy curtains of the windows
then he went through the drawing-room
and out to the veranda where the watch-
man lay asleep on his roped charpoy bar-
low woke him  theres a thief prowling
about the bungalow do not sleep till i give
you permission see that no one enters he
commanded

  he went back to his room closed and
barred the door and told bootea to come

  when the girl entered he said  you
should not have come here there are eyes
and ears and evil tongues

   that is true sahib but also death is
evil-sometimes i have brought this to the
sahib bootea said as she drew a paper
from her breast and passed it to the cap-
tain it was the pardon the resident had
given that morning to ajeet singh

  barlow though startled schooled his
voice to an even tone as he asked  where
did you get this-where is ajeet

   as to the paper sahib what matters
how bootea came by it as to ajeet he is
in the grasp of the dewan who learned
that he had been to the resident in the
way of treachery

   ajeet thought nana sahib had stolen
you bootea

   yes sahib for he did not find me when
he went to the camp and i did not go
there but now he would betray the sahibs
-that is why i have brought back the pa-
per of protection

   will they kill ajeet barlow asked

   i will tell the sahib what is the girl
answered drawing her sari over her curled
in feet and leaning one arm on barlows
chair  the decoity that was committed
last night was as ajeet feared because of
treachery on the part of the dewan i will
tell it all though it might be thought a
treachery to the decoits as to being false
to ones own clan ajeet is because he is a
bagree-but i am not

  barlow pondered over this statement
the girl had mystified him-that is as to
her breeding sometimes she spoke in the
first person and again in the third person
like so many natives as if her language had
been picked up colloquially but then the
use of the third person when she used
bootea instead of a nominative pronoun
might be due to a cultured deference to-
ward a sahib

   i thought you were not of these people
-you are of high caste bootea he said
presently

  he heard the girl gasp and looking
quickly into her eyes saw that they were
staring as if in fright

  for a space of a few seconds she did not
answer then she spoke and barlow felt her
voice was being held under control by
force of will  i am bootea one in the
care of ajeet singh that is the present
sahib and the past- she touched the
iron bracelet on her arm and looked into
barlows eyes as if she asked him to bury
the past

   sorry girl-forgive me he said

   ajeet has told why the men were
brought-for what purpose

   yes gulab-to kill amir khan

   and when they refused to go on this
mission the dewan to get them in his
power connived with hunsa to make the
decoity so that their lives would be forfeit
then if the dewan punished them for not
going the rajah of karowlee could not
make trouble hunsa told the dewan that
if i were sent todance before amir khan


argosy-allstory weekly

  some of the men going as musicians and
  actors the chief would fall in love with
  me and that i could betray him to those
  who would kill him that he would come to
  my tent at night unobserved-because he
  has a wife with him-and that hunsa
  would creep into the tent and kill him as
  he slept then we would escape

    barlow sprang to his feet and paced the
  floor then he plumped into the chair again
  saying  what an unholy scheme even
  for india gad how i wish id killed
  the brute when i had the chance

     i did not know that hunsa had pro-
  posed this neither did ajeet for they
  wanted to get him in their power through
  the decoity so that if he refused permission
  he might be killed and now ajeet is
  trapped through the decoity and bootea is
  going to the pindari camp

     youre not going to betray amir khan
  have him murdered barlow cried aghast
  at the villainy at the thought that one so
  sweet could be forced to complicity in such
  a ghastly crime

      no sahib to save his life for if i do
  not go now ajeet will be killed and all the
  others put in prison because of the decoity
  worse will happen bootea-she will be
  placed in the seraglio of nana sahib

 damn it they cant do that bar-
low exclaimed angrily ill stop that

   no the sahib cant and he has a mis-
sion he is not of the service of protecting
bootea

   you cant save amir khans life unless
you betray the bagrees to him

   yes sahib i can perhaps the chief
will like bootea and will listen to what
she says men such as brave warriors al-
ways treat bootea not as a nautchni so i
will ask him not to come to my tent at
night because of ill repute hunsa will not
be able to slay him unless it is a trap or my
part to get him from the watching eyes of
his men if hunsa becomes suspicious and
there is real danger i will threaten that i
will expose him to the chief if we come
back because we have failed in our mission
having tried to succeed it will not be like
refusing to go and perhaps there will be
mercy shown

  mercy i barlow sneered nana

    sahib knows nothing of mercy hes a
    tiger

        but if i refuse to go another nautchni
     will be sent perhaps more beautiful than
     i am and she would betray the chief and
     perhaps all would be killed

       by jove youre some woman youre
    magnificent-youre like a rajputni prin-
    cess

      a slim hand was placed on barlows
    wrist and the girl said  sahib i am just
    bootea-please please

        and thats your reason for taking this
     awful chance to save ajeet and the others
     is it

        there is another reason sahib the
    girl dropped her eyes and turning a gold
    bangle on her wrist gazed upon a ruby that
    had the contour of a serpents head pres-
    ently she asked  will the sahib go to
    khureyra and have a knife thrust between
    his ribs

      barlow was startled by this query

     why should i go to khureyra gulab

       to see amir khan

       what makes you say that

     because it is known but the chief is
  not now there-he has taken his horsemen
  to saugor

    again this was startling also the in-
  formation was of great value if the pin-
  dari horde had left the territory of sind-
  hia and crossed the border into saugor
  they were closer to the british

    barlow patted the girls hand saying

   my salaams to you little girl

     he felt her slim cool fingers press his
  hand but he shrank from the claiming
  touch muttering  the damned barrier 
  suddenly barlow remembered bootea
  had spoken of another reason for going to
  the pindari camp he puzzled over this a
  little hesitating to question her she had
  not told him what it was but had asked if
  he were going there the reason evidendy
  had something to do with him it couldnt
  be treachery-she had done so much for
  him it must be the something that looked
  out of her eyes when they rested on his
  face the unworded greatest thing on earth
  in the way of fealty and devotion pos-
  sibly this was the grand motive the reason
  she had given being secondary

                            a
cas ie



   you said gulab that you had another
reason for this awful trip what is it he
asked

  the girls eyes dropped to the ruby
bracelet again to acquire merit in the
eyes of mahadeo sahib

    to do good acts so that you may be re-
incarnated as a heaven-born a brahmini
perhaps even come back as a memsahib
gulab

  at this her big eyes rose to barlows
face and he could swear that there were
tears misting them and sensing that if she
had fallen in love with him what he had
said about her becoming a memsahib had
hurt perhaps she realized as he did that
that was the barred door to happiness-
that she wasnt of the white race

   yes sahib she said presently  a
swami told me that in a former life i had
been evil

  the swami is an awful liar barlow
ejaculated

    the holy ones speak the truth sahib
the swami said that because of having
been beautiful i had caused deaths through
jealousy

  oh the crazy fool barlow declared
in english  and its all rot this is the
reason you spoke of gulab-good deeds
is it the only other reason

  the girl turned her face away and bar-
low saw her shoulders quiver

  he rose from the chair and lifting the
girl to her feet held her in his arms say-
ing  look me in the eyes gulab and
tell me if you are going through this devil-
ish thing because of me

   bootea is going to the camp of amir
khan because hunsa and the others have
been told to kill the sahib and she will see
that this is not accomplished

   barlow clasped the girl to his breast and
smothered her face in kisses  you are
the sweetest little woman that ever lived
he said  and i am a sinner for this can
only bring you misery

   sahib-it cant be but it is not mis-
ery the sweet pain has been put in the
heart of bootea by the sahibs eyes and
she is happy but do not go as a sahib
barlow cursed softly to himself mutter-
ing  india even dreams are not un-
 a

heard then-what made you say

that he queried

  it is known because that is the way of
the sahib he knows that where he sleeps
or eats or plays games with the little balls
that there are always servants and it is
known that captain barlow is called the
patan by his friends

  st george and the cross he ejacu-
lated and then he added if i went thus
would they know me

   there would be danger but the sahib
knowing of this could take more care in
the way of deceit but bootea will know-
the eyes will not be hidden

  then he thought of hunsa and asked
 but arent you afraid to go with that
beast hunsa

  the girl laughed  the decoits have or-
ders from the dewan to kill him if i com-
plain of him but if they do not he is prom-
ised the torture when he comes back if i
make complaint if the sahib will but wait
a few days before the journey so that
bootea has made friends with amir khan
before he comes it will be better we will
start in two days

   ill see gulab he answered evasively
 you are going now

   yes sahib it has been said

   not alone gulab ill send the door-
man with you

   no bootea will be better alone she
touched the knife in her sash  it must
not be known that bootea came to the
sahib

  barlow took her arm leading her through
the bathroom to the back door he opened
it and listened intently for a few seconds
then he took her oval face in his palms and
kissed her passionately saying  good-by
little girl god be with you you are
sweet

   the sahib is like a god to bootea she
whispered

  as the girl slipped away between the
bushes like something floating out of a
dream barlow stood at the open door a
resurge of abasement flooding his soul in
the combat between his mentality and his
heart the heart was making him a weakling
a dishonorable weakling so it seemed he
pulled the door shut and went back to his

bed and finally fell asleep a thing of tor-
tured unrest

chapter xvii

demand these murderers

barlow was up early next morning
wakened by that universal alarm clock
in india-the gray-necked small-
bodied city crow whose tribe is called the
seven sisters-noisy impudent clamorous
sharp-eyed thieves that throng the com-
pounds like sparrows that hop in through
the open window and steal a slice of toast
from beside the cup of tea at the bedside

  he mounted the waiting cabuli pony and
rode to the residency he had much to
talk over with hodson in the light of all
that had transpired in the last two days
and also he had a hope that elizabeth
would be possessed of an after-the-storm
calm would greet him and somehow give
him a moral sustaining against his lapse
in heart loyalty mentally he didnt label
his feeling toward elizabeth love toward
her it had been largely a matter of drifting
undoubted giving in to suasion more of
association than what was said she had
class she was intellectual there was no
doubt about her wit-it was like a well-cut
diamond-sparkling brilliant no warmth
when barlow reflected jogging along on
the cabuli that he probably did not love
elizabeth picturing the passion as typified
by romeo and juliet as instance he sud-
denly asked himself  by jove and
does anybody except the pater love eliza-
beth he was doubtful if anybody did
all the servants held her in esteem for she
was just and not niggardly but hers was
certainly not a disposition to cause spon-
taneous affection perhaps the word ad-
mirable epitomized elizabeth all around
but he felt that he needed a sort of chris-
tian science sustaining as it were in this
sensuous drifting-something to make his
slipping appear more obnoxious

   as he rode up to the veranda of the resi-
dency he saw elizabeth cutting flowers
probably to decorate the breakfast table
that was like elizabeth instead of leaving
it to the malili-gardener-with the butler

to festoon the table she was doing it her-
self it was an occupation skin to water-
color painting or lace work just the sort of
thing to find elizabeth at-typical

   barlow was possessed of a hopeful fancy
 that perhaps she had not ridden expect-
 ing that he would call on the resident but
 as always with the residents daughter he
 could deduct nothing from her manner
 she nodded pleasantly on looking up a
 gloved hand full of roses and as he slipped
 from the saddle relinquishing the horse to
 the syce she fell in beside him as far as the
 veranda where they stood talking desul-
 tory stuff the morning sun on the pink
 and avhite oleanders the curious snakelike
 mottling of the croton leaves and the song
 of a dhyal that high in a tamarind was
 bubbling liquid notes of joy

    the indian robin red breast makes one
 homesick elizabeth said

    home-- but the girl put a quick hand
 on his arm checking him the action was
 absolutely like elizabeth imperious a
 small long-tailed brown-breasted bird had
 darted across the compound to a mango
 tree from where he warbled a love song as
 sweet and rich toned as the evensong of a
 nightingale

    the shama elizabeth said  when i
 hear him i close my eyes and picture the
 downs and oaked hills of england and
 fancv im listening to the nightingale or the
 lark

   barlow turned involuntarily to look into
 the girls face it was an inquisitive look
 a wondering look gentle sentiment com-
 ing from elizabeth was rather a reversal of
 form

   also there was immediately a reversal of
 bird form a shatterment of sentiment a
 rasping maddening note from somewhere in
 the dome of a pipal tree a koel bird as
 if in derision of the feathered songsters sent
 forth his shrill plaintive  ko-e-e-el ko-e-
 el ko-e-e-el

    ah-a-a barlow exclaimed in disgust
  thats india the feverbird the koel har-
 binger of the hot spell of burning sun and
 stifling dust and throbbing head

   he cursed the koel for the gentle mood
 had slipped from elizabeth he had hoped
 that she would have spoken of yesterday
caste



 give him a snamed solace for the hurt she
 had given him of course hodson would
 have told her all about the gulab but
 while that the service was sufficient for
 the resident elizabeth would consider the
 fact that barlow knew bootea well enough
 to have this service rendered it would
 touch her caste-also her exacting nature

  something like this was floating through
his mind as he groped mentally for an ex-
planation of elizabeths attitude the effect
of which was neutral nothing to draw him
toward her in a way of moral sustaining
but also nothing to antagonize him

  she must know that he was leaving on a
dangerous mission but she did not bring it
up perhaps with her usual diffident re-
serve she felt that it was his province to
speak of that

  at any rate she called to a hovering
bearer telling him to give his master cap-
tain barlows salaams then with the
flowers she passed into the bungalow

  barlow gazed after elizabeth ruefully
wishing she had thrown him a life belt
however it did not matter it was up to
him to act in a sane manner men of the
service were taught to rely on themselves
and in barlow was the something of breed-
ing that held him to the true thing to the
pole the breeding might be compared to
the elusive thing in the magnetic needle it
did riot matter he would probably marry
elizabeth-it seemed the proper thing to
do devilish few ofthe chaps he knew
babbled much about love and being batty
over a girl-that is the girls they married

  then the bearer brought hodsons
salaams to the captain

  and hodson was a civil servant in ex-
celsis he took to bed with him his form
d and form c-even the  d o the
demi official business and worried over it
when he should have slept or read himself
to sleep duty to him was a more exacting
god than the black kali to the brahmins
it had dried up his blood atrophied his
nerves of enjoyment and now he was de-
pressed though he strove to greet barlow
cheerily

    its a devilish shindy this killing of our
two chaps he burst out  ive pondered
over it and ive worried over it the

only solace in the thing is that the arm of

the law is long

    i think youve got it sir barlow en-
couraged  when weve smashed sindhia
--and we will-well demand these mur-
derers hang a few of them and send the
rest to the andamans

    yes it has simply got to wait to stir
up things now would only let the peshwa
know what you are going to do-wed show
him our hand and i dont mind telling
you captain that he is an absolute traitor
and  believe that its that damn nana sa-
hib whos influencing him

    theres no doubt about it sir

  no there is not the resident de-
clared gloomily  the two dead sowars
must be considered as sacrifice just as
though they had fallen in battle its for the
good of the raj if i get hauled over the
coals for this i dont give a damn ive
pondered over it almost prayed over it
and its the only way theres talk of a
big loot of jewelry by these decoits and
the killing of the merchant and his men but
ive got nothing to do with that the one
wonderful thing is that we saved the pa-
pers that little native woman that brought
them to you must be rewarded later by
the way barlow i took the liberty of ex-
plaining all that to elizabeth and i think
shes pretty badly cut up over the way she
acted but you understand dont you
captain i believe that if it had been my
case id have-well id have known that it
was because the girl cared elizabeth is
undemonstrative-too much so in fact
its so long ago that i took notice of these
things that i find im trying to speak in an
unknown tongue

   the little man rose and bustled about
pulling out drawers from the cabinet and
shoving them back again venting little
asthmetic coughs of sheer nervousness
then coming up to barlow he held out his
hand saying  my dear boy god be with
you but dont take chances-will you
at that instant elizabeth appeared at the
doorway  captain barlow will have
breakfast with us wont he father its
all ready and boodha says he has a chop
and kidney curry that is a dream

   jupiter hodson exclaimed  fancy


argosy-allstory weekly

im getting india head was sending bar-
low off without a word about breakfast of
course hell stay thanks elizabeth

   the tired drawn parchment face of the
resident became revivified it was the face
of a happy boy the gray eyes blued to
youth inwardly he murmured  eliza-
beth is wonderful i knew it good girl
it was a curious breakfast-mentally
elizabeth was the elizabeth of the veranda
perhaps it was the passionate beating of
the pillow the day before when she had
realized for the first time what barlow
meant to her that nowt cast her into de-
fense encased her in an armor of protec-
tion caused her to assume a casualness
she would give worlds to not have said
what she had said the day before but the
captain must know that she had been
roused by a knowledge of his intimacy with
the gulab just what had occurred did not
matter-not in the least it was his place
to explain it that was elizabeths way-
it was her manner of thought-a subservi-
ence of impulse to propriety to class in
the light of her feeling when she had lain
wet eyed beating the pillow she knew that
if he had put his arms about her and said
just even stupid words- im sorry beth
you know i love you -she would have
capitulated perhaps even in the capitula-
tion have said a bethism  it doesnt
matter-well never mention it again

   but barlow very much of a boy could
not feel this elusive thing and rode away
after breakfast from the bungalow mutter-
ing  by gad elizabeth should have
said something over roasting me fancy
she doesnt care a hang anyway-ill give
her credit for that-she doesnt hunt with
the hounds and run with the hare if its
the prospect of sharing a title with me a
rotter would have eaten the leek yes
elizabeth is class

chapter xviii

 thou art a dog

dewan sewlal was in a shiver of
apprehension over the killing of the
two sepoys there would be trouble
over this if the resident came to know of it

   but hunsa had assured him that the sol-
 diers and their saddles had been buried in
 the pit with the others and that nobody
 but the decpits knew of their advent

   then when he learned that ajeet singh
 had been to the resident he was in a pank
 but as that british official made no move
 said nothing about the decoity he fancied
 that perhaps ajeet had not mentioned this
 in fact he had no proof that he had made a
 confession at all but ajeets complicity in
 the decoity where the merchant and his
 men had been killed gave the dewan just
 what he had planned for-the power of
 death over the chief as to his own com-
 plicity he held taken care to speak of the
 decoity to no one but hunsa the yogi
 had been inspired of course but the yogi
 would not appear as a witness against him
 and hunsa would not because it would
 cost him his head

   so now at a hint from nana sahib the
 dewan seized upon ajeet voicing a right-
 eous indignation at his crime of decoity
 and gave him the alternative of being
 strangled with a bowstring or forcing the
 gulab to go to the camp of amir khan to
 betray him not only would ajeet be
 killed but bootea would be thrust into the
 seraglio and the other bagrees put in prison
 -some might be killed ajeet was forced
 to yield to these threats the very com-
 plicity of the dewan made him the more
 hurried in this thing also he wanted to
 get the bagrees away to the pindari camp
 before the resident made a move

   the mission to amir khan would be
 placed in the hands of hunsa and sookdee
 ajeet being retained as a pawn also his
 wound had incapacitated him he was
 nominally at liberty though he knew well
 that if he sought to escape the mahrattas
 would kill him

   the jewels that had been stolen from
 the merchant were largely retained by the
 bagrees though the dewan found one
 night very mysteriously a magnificent
 string of pearls on his pillow he did not
 ask questions and seemingly no one of his
 household knew anything about the pearls

 when the yogi asked hunsa about the
ruby-the akbar lamp-hunsa who had
determined to keep it himself as perhaps
caste



a ransom for his life in that troublous time
declared that in the turmoil of the coming
of the soldiers he had not found it indeed
this seemed reasonable for he having fled
down the road to the gulab had not been
there when they had opened the box and
looted it

  so the dewan sent for ajeet hunsa and
sookdee and declared that if the bagree
contingent of murder did not start at once
for the pindari camp he would have them
taken up for the decoity

  it was ajeet who answered the dewan

   dewan sahib we be men who under-
take all things in the favor of bhowanee
and we make prayer to that goddess if
the dewan will give fifty rupees for our
pooja to-morrow we will make sacrifice to
her for without the feast and the sacrifice
the signs that she would vouchsafe would
be false then we will take the signs and
the men will go at once

   you shall have the money the dewan
declared  but do not delay

  that evening the bagrees made their way
to a mango grove for the feast carrying co-
conuts raw sugar flour butter and a fra-
grant gum goo jut a large hole was dug
in the ground and filled with dry cow-dung
chips which were set on fire sweet cakes
were baked on the fire and then broken
into small pieces a portion of the fire raked
to one side and their priest sprinkled upon
it the fragrant gum calling in a loud voice
 maha kali assist and guide us in our ex-
pedition keep calamity from us who wor-
ship thee and have made this feast in thy
honor give us the sign that we may know
if it is agreeable to thee that we destroy
the enemy of maharaja sindhiay

  when the bagrees had eaten much
cooked rice and meatballs which were
served on plantain leaves they drank ro-
bustly of mhowa spirit first spilling some
of this liquor upon the ground in the name
of the goddess

   the strong rank native liquor roused an
enthusiasm for their approaching interview
with the sacred one once ajeet laid his
hand upon the pitcher that hunsa was
holding to his coarse lips and pressing it
downward admonished

   hunsa whilst bhowanee does not pro-

hibit it is an offense to approach her ex-
cept in devout silence

  the surly one flared up at this his tin-
governable rage drew his hand to a knife in
his belt and his eyes blazed with the fero-
city of a wounded tiger

   ajeet he snarled  you are now chief
but you are not rajah to command slaves
with a swift twist of his wrist ajeet
snatched the pitcher from the hand of
hunsa saying  jamadar it is the liquor
that is in you therefore you have had
enough

  but hunsa sprang to his feet and his
knife gleamed like the spitting of fire in the
slanting rays of the setting sun as he drove
viciously at the heart of his chief there
was a crash as the blade struck and pierced
the matka which ajeet still held by its long
neck

  there was a scream of terror from the
throats of the women a cry of horror from
the guru at this sacrilege-the spilling of
liquor upon the earth in anger at the feast
of bhowanee

  ajeets strong fingers slim bronzed
lengths of steel had gripped the wrist of
his assailant as bootea darting forward
laid a hand upon the arm of hunsa crying
 shame shame you are like sweepers of
low caste-eaters of carrion they who re-
spect not bhowanee shame you are a
dog-a lapper of liquor

  at the touch of the gulab on his arm
and the scorn in her eyes hunsa shivered
and drew back his head hanging in abase-
ment but his face devilish in its malignity

  ajeet taking a brass dish poured water
upon the hand that had gripped the wrist
of hunsa saying  thus i will cleanse the
defilement then he sat down upon his
heels adding  guru holy one repeat a
prayer to appease bhowanee then we will
go into the jungle and take the auspices
the guru strode over to hunsa and
holding out his thin skinny palm com-
manded jamadar from you a rupee
and to-morrow i will put upon the shrine
of kali coconuts and sweetmeats and
marigolds as peace offerings

  hunsa took from his loin cloth a silver
ooin and dropped it surlily in the out-
stretched hand sneering  to bhowanee


argosy-allstory weekly

you will give four annas and you will feast of wood against a hollow pipe-of the little
to the value of twelve annas for that is green-plumaged coppersmith bird a honey-

the way of your craft the vultures al-
ways finish the bait when the tiger has
been slain

   soon the feathery lace work of bamboos
beneath which they sat were whispering to
the night wind that had roused at the drop-
ping of the huge ball of fire in the west and
the soft radiance of a gentle moon was gild-
ing with silver the gaunt black arms of a
babool then the priest said  come
jamadars we nowt will go deeper into the
silent places and listen for the voice of
bhowanee

   he untangled from the posture of sitting
his parchment-covered matter of bones
and carrying in one hand a brocaded bag
of black velvet and in the other a staff
with bowed head and mutterings started
deeper into the jungle of cactus and slim
whispering bamboo followed by ajeet
sookdee and hunsa presently he stopped
saying  sit you in a line brave chiefs fac-
ing the great temple of siva which is in
the mountains of the east so that the voice
of bhowanee coming out of the silent places
and from the mouth of the jackal or the
jackass shall be known to be from the right
or the left for thus will be the interpreta-
tion

   the priest took his place in front of the
jamadars sitting with his back to them
and placed upon the ground first a white
cloth of cotton and then the velvet bag
upon which rested a silver pick-ax

   when ajeet saw the pick-ax he said an-
grily  that is the emblem of thugs we
be decoits not stranglers guru

   they are equal in honor with bhowa-
nee the guru replied  they slay for pro-
fit even as you do and among you are
those who are thugs for i minister to both

   then the guru buried his shriveled skull
in his thin hands and drooped forward in
silent listening ajeet objected no more
and in the new silence they could hear the
shrill rasping of cicada in the foliage of a
gigantic elephant-creeper that like a huge
python crawled its way from branch to
branch sprawling across a dozen stately
trees from somewhere beyond was a
steady tonkl tonkl tonk-like the beat

badger came timorously creeping his feet
shuffling the fallen leaves peered at the
strange figures of the men and at the move
of an arm fled scurrying through the still-
ness with the noise of some great creature

   suddenly the jungle was stilled even from
 the voice of the rasping cicada the leaves
 had ceased to whisper for the wind had
 hushed the devotees could hear the beat-
 ing of their hearts in the strain of waiting
 for a manifestation from the dread goddess
 the white-robed figure of the guru was like
 a shriveled statue of alabaster where the
 faint moon picked it out in blotches as the
 light filtered through leaves above

   sookdee gasped in terror as just above
them a tiny tree owl called  whoo-whoo
whoo-whoo  as if he jeered but ajeet
knew that that in their belief was a sign
of encouragement meaning not overmuch
but not an evil omen from far off floated
up on the dead night air the belling note of
a startled cheetal and almost at once the
harsh grating angry roar of a leopard as
though he had struck for the throat of the
stag and missed these were but jungle
voices not in the curriculum of their pan-
theistic belief so the guru and the bagrees
sat in silence and no one spoke

   then the night carried the faint trem-
bling moan of a jackal coming from a dis-

the jackal wailed the note rising to a fiend-
ish crescendo and then suddenly it hushed
and there was only a ghastly silence in the
jungle depths

  the white-clothed ghostlike priest
sprang to his feet and with his lean arm
stretched high in suppliance said  bho-
wanee thou hast vouchsafed to thy devo-
tees the pilao we will strew thy shrine
with flowers and sweetmeats

  he turned to the jamadars who had
risen saying  bhowanee is pleased the
auspices are favorable had the call been
from the right it would have been the tibao
and we should have had to wait until the
sweet goddess gave us another sign now
we may go back and perhaps she will con-
firm this omen as we go
caste



  hunsa always possessed of a mean dis-
position and still sulky over the encounter
with ajeet was in an evil mood as they
trudged through the jungle to their camp
when ajeet spoke of the priests success
in his appeal he snarled  the hangman
always advises the one who is to have his
neck stretched that he is better off dead

   what do you mean by that ajeet
queried

    just that you are not going on this mis-
sion ajeet then he laughed disagreeably

   if you are afraid to go sookdee will be
well without you ajeet retorted

  before more could be said in this way
and as they approached the camp the low-
ing of a cow was heard

   dost hear that guru hunsa queried
 in a decoity is not the lowing of a cow in
a village held to be an evil omen

   not so hunsa the priest declared

 it is an evil omen if the decoity is to be
made on the village in which the cow raises
her voice but we are going to our own
camp in peace and it is a voice of ap-
proval

   as to that ajeet commented  if
hunsa is right it is written in our code of
omens that hearing a cow call thus simply
means that one of the party making the
decoity will be killed perhaps as he was
the one to notice it the evil will fall upon
him

   youd like that hunsa growled

   not being given to lies it would not
displease me for as the hangman said you
would be better dead

  but they were now at their camp and the
jamadars standing together for a little set-
tied it that the omens being favorable and
the wrath of the dewan feared they would
proceed to the pindari camp next day

 to be continued next week

above yon somber swell of land

       thou seest the dawns grave orange hue

with one pale streak like yellow sand

and over that a vein of blue

over the broad hill creeps a beam

    like hope that gilds a good mans brow

 and now ascends the nostril-stream
 of stalwart horses come to plow

 ye rigid plowmen bear in mind
 your labor is for future hours

 advance-spare not-nor look behind

    plow deep and straight with all your powers

  a thin layer of mud over the compact
clay soil had rendered footing
x  treacherous and for the fifth time
that morning corporal personne picked him-
self up shifted his straps and resumed his
place in the long file of men then he
contemplated the indo-chinese landscape
with disfavor

  it was february  and since decem-
ber of the previous year the tiny garrison
at tuyen quan a little over five hundred
men under the command of major domine
with but six pieces of artillery and only six
engineers had held out heroically against
a black flag army of several thousand led
by luh vinh phuoc personnel battalion

was the advance guard of the column mov-
ing to the relief

  thin veils of fog drizzled a warm rain
that diluted the pipe clay on the corporals
pith helmet ran down his face seeped in-
side his collar and hung in drops from his
bristly beard on either side of the nar-
row roadway-seldom wide enough for two
men to march abreast-the rice fields flood-
ed with a foot of water sent up a suffocating
moisture out of nowhere apparently bul-
lets sang and snapped like over-taut violin
strings a man just hit pitched forward
face into the water his hardware clattering
about him from the rear came the cursing
of the naval gunners in charge of the two
eighty millimeter guns coaxing the recalci-
trant mules forward

  the men were not in the best of humor
since early morning they had contended
with narrow roads dampness and heat and
the pot shooting of the chinese pirates hid-

den in the clumps of high grass scattered
over the dreary plain the iegionaires were
ripe for a fight let the black flags make
a stand and they would pay that the
french republic considered her rights to the
province of tonkin greater than the claim
of the king of annam did not concern
these hardened soldiers of the legion the
right and wrong of the international quar-
rel seemed beside the mark with an enemy
who took pleasure in torturing his captives

  but corporal personne remained com-
paratively cheerful this was his life work
and he loved it small inconveniences
would soon be forgotten in the thrill of con-
flict he was an american bom and bred
some incident unknown to his comrades
perhaps forgotten by himself had driven
him first to france then into the foreign
legion where no questions are asked

  a strange lot they were there in front
of him was an ex-priest at his back the
son of a grand duke and by his side his
best friend pat an ex-street sweeper from
dublin and he himself had enlisted under
the name of  personne which is french
for  nobody these legionaires from
the comers of the earth became part of a
solid unit welded together as they were by
the  esprit de corps -the soul of an
army from the confines of the sahara
from the town of sidi bel abbes the
 home  of the legion france had called
her adopted sons to indo-china

  as the column reached the lower slopes
of a range of hills the day suddenly bright-
ened the sun breaking through the mists
picked out the metallic ornaments on the
uniforms with vivid sparkles of color the
song-bird the son of an arab peanut dealer
in dakar started a popular ballad and the
men picked up the chorus not always har-
monious but encouraging to the jaded offi-
cers who feared for the morale

  when the troops reached the crest of the
hill and a halt was called major epervier
in command gathered his officers about him
away from barracks they were all men
together and rank except in actual line of
duty was not impressed months of cam-
paigning forcibly creates friendship-or
hatred at any rate etiquette is relaxed
through field glasses the major had dis-

covered the red roof of a pagoda emerging
from the tangle of bush in the valley below

   no signs of life put in the youngest
captain naturally the first to talk

   one cant always tell the major an-
swered

   why not go down and find out the
naval lieutenant impetuously suggested he
had been put in charge of the artillery pos-
sibly because the guns were drawn by mules
in the general army scheme the square plug
should always be placed in a round hole
a lawyer should rub down horses a black-
smith keep books in regimental offices

    a valley is not the best strategical posi-
tion for an isolated body of infantry liable
to attack by superior numbers the major
remarked dryly  you know what the
flags are at close quarters where we have
no chance to use superior discipline and
tactics

   but the column must pass there either
to-day or to-morrow why not let me have
a few men and find out the ardent young
lieutenant went on

  the major smiled at the thought of the
inexperienced officer blundering down into
the village  i have formal instructions
not to risk my officers i think though i
have the man for the job hes been in my
battalion five years and whatever hes been
given to do he did-and came back-

   the pitcher to the well-

   perhaps- agreed the major and
turned abruptly  personne

  corporal personne drying his clothes by
the fire pulled his seventy-five inches erect
and came over to the major where he stood
at attention in a not overclean undershirt
in the palm of his hand he held his pipe
while he hurriedly swallowed the last of a
bit of ammunition bread the officers
smiled but he remained impassive his
eyes even did not flicker though often
treated with consideration he never relaxed
his reserve this had given rise to the be-
lief that he was a plutocrat by birth his
heels together little finger on the seam of
his trousers corporal personne the per-
fect non-com now awaited orders

  the major cleared his throat with an
awkward cough  these are not orders
personne you may refuse if you wish


argosy-allstory weekly

 he indicated the pagoda  the village
 down there may be occupied it may not
 t want to find out

     yes sir

    risky but you and i have seen worse
 eh

    much worse major personne assented
 gravely  how many men shall i take

    five

   personne went back to the fire a few
 minutes low conversation and the five men
 got up resumed their clothing picked up
 their rifles from the stacks tightened the
 chin straps of their helmets personne led
 the way down the hill where they were
 soon lost to view

    there go six good men the major de-
 clared he knew some of his men personal-
 ly was familiar with their history played
 father confessor knew their real names that
 he might advise their relatives in case of
 death

    theyre gone all right-if that village
 is occupied the naval lieutenant put in
  unless we move down if we hear firing

     i half suspect you of deliberately trying
 to get us into a mess the major observed
  youd ask nothing better than to play with
 your new pets whatever happens we cant
 move until the whole column comes up and
 i get orders from the colonel-

    wholl probably take three days to
 make up his mind disrespectfully added
 the sailor  whatever happens lets hope
 the fellows arent taken alive

   personne had wisely picked his men
 mitri the russian pat bicco sanglier
 the boar so called because of his massive
 shoulders and hairy face and ganache who
 jokingly pretended to be an english lord
 though his accent was cockney and his name
 french they advanced slowly through the
 high grass the tops of which rustled sev-
 eral feet above their heads at least half
 an hours time elapsed before they came in
 sight of the village a cluster of mud huts
 forming a street with the pagoda standing
 fully two hundred yards away

 my mother the milordess would be
surprised to see me ganache whispered for

 the silence weighed upon him  she would
 never allow me out without the maid and
 the fifth footman-

    personne signaled for silence ordered his
 men to wait and himself stepped out into
 the open when no one appeared he called
 the others to join him they searched
 the huts ashes still warm in the fireplaces
 the usual stench of the native village a dog
 a few pigs running about-nothing more
 ganache stopped in front of a placard ran
 his fingers along the line of chinese char-
 acters pretending to spell out the words
  mr and mrs mandarin compelled to de-
 part for health reasons left the key under
 the mat-

   sanglier slapped him on the back the
 others joined in the laugh more from ner-
 vousness than genuine mirth as bicco
 bent past genaches shoulders to add his
 comment a shot rang out and he sank a
 bullet in his throat

    sanglier his face scarlet from excitement
 swore volubly in five languages mitri
 turned and fired into the bush nonchalant-
 ly as though he were paying a visit to a
 private game preserve pat and personne
 were methodical ganache kept his eyes on
 his corporal as though awaiting orders

     make for the pagoda cried personne
 and set the example the others followed
 no sooner were they in the open than the
 flags swarmed out of the grass and pressed
 down upon them

     back to back personnes voice rose
 above the uproar the gras rifles rattled
 and the conflict became hand to hand

    pat went down first his head hacked off
 by a yataghan stroke mitri beaten to his
 knees managed a grin before he was fin-
 ished sanglier bleeding from several
 wounds wept in his rage tears and per-
 spiration streaked the dirt on his face a
 pistol shot smashed through both cheeks
 the blood ran from his mouth he fell
 sprawied on the ground and groaned as
 steel dug into his back only personne
 and ganache were left back to back the
 tall american towering above the diminu-
 tive cockney

  say big one the little man shouted

 dont worry about me run for the pa-
goda-you can make it-
six good men



   shut up-you d- fool--

   well-if you wont listen to reason-
ganache turned the muzzle of his piece up-
ward and pressed the trigger he would
not be taken alive

  personne was aione now his helmet fallen
off a deep cut in his scalp he swung his
rifle by the barrel freed a circle around
him writh desperate fury he leaped into
the midst of the assailants he was an
american therefore handy with his fists
and the legion cultivates  la savatte the
art of fighting with ones feet he was soon
in the open with a clear way and where
could he go except toward the pagoda

  the door was closed fastened on the in-
side and he found himself cornered oh
for the sight of the old battalion charg-
ing through the filthy street with their chin
straps between their teeth his back
against the door he pulled a revolver from
an inside pocket with the first shot he
picked off the leader who dropped his long
barbed spear to clutch at his stomach and
rolled over on the ground the others hesi-
tated for a moment only then with a shout
of angered determination closed in

  with each shot personne dropped a man
after the fifth he lifted the barrel to his
temple before he could pull the trigger
in that fraction of a second that he hesi-
tated the door behind him opened and he
was conscious of falling backward the
sudden drop the deep darkness dazed him
but he knew that the door had closed and
that he was inside

  the corporal picked himself up laughing
he recalled mafiy other hair-breadth es-
capes no this wasnt his last adventure
something was looking after him-the thing
men call  luck but-although luck
seemed to have caused the door to swing
open whence came the positive force to
swing it shut again luck must have had
an assistant

  he fumbled for a match the sulphur
sputtered then flamed-and lit up-first
a patch of silk fabric multicolored then
a slim tiny hand with shining finger nails
above that a graceful brownish throat and
the face of a girl the complexion was rose
on olive delicately tinted as porcelain

  the match burned his fingers and he

  dropped it to the floor reached out and
touched the girls shoulder the silk rus-
tled and her flesh seemed cool like polished
marble

   thank you miss you sure picked the
right moment- he whispered into the
darkness

  she answered in native dialect per-
sonne was at a loss until the few words
he had picked up around the barracks in
hanoi came back to him she had been
praying in the pagoda for a husband a
white husband the corporal laughed loud-
ly women are the same the world over
something new a uniform never fails

  he patted her cheek outside the chi-
nese were pounding on the door

   you poor little devil if youve elected
me youll soon be a widow-unless i get out
of here

  his doll-like companion chattered volu-
bly this time he could not understand
all was now quiet outside an ominous si-
lence perhaps they had sent for the
 bonze or whatever they called their
priest to come and open the door

   how does one get out he urged

  shcpiust have understood for her soft
warm little hand nestled in his big palm
closing around his fingers she moved
away gently tugging at him after a few
steps he heard her fumble with a latch of
some sort to help he lit another match
she sneezed as the pungent smell of sulphur
teased her nostrils and her brown eyes
gleamed with amusement he smiled
why shouldnt he  would he not be soon
on his way back to the battalion

  then a door opened he faced about
dazzled by the sudden light and reached
for his revolver his mind framed the
thoughts with lightning rapidity he had
one cartridge left and a fighting chance to
reach the open should he use it on himself
or take the risk once before he had been
about to shoot himself and something had
saved him  to the last ditch he mut-
tered and fired into the thick of the flags
flung the weapon in the face of the nearest
and plunged in with flying fists

  for a brief moment he hoped-then some
one tripped him before he could recover
he was seized around the legs by the arms


argosy-allstory weekly

  and a rope was thrown about his neck
twisted to cut off his breath it was only
a matter of minutes before he found him-
self bound and carried into the open the
girl had screamed as though in terror but
in her eyes he read a deep pity-and some-
thing more admiration-love he would
never know

  the flags dropped him without undue
gentleness near a mud hut in the center of
the village a couple of blows from a rifle
butt impressed upon him the uselessness of
struggle he remained quiet until the
crowd moved away then managed to gain
a sitting position against the mud wall but
he had not been left unguarded a dirty
flag his felt shod feet folded beneath him
looking like a particularly ugly buddha
noisily chewed a kaki the blood-red fruit of
the orient he caught personoes eye
grinned and pointed to the opposite side of
the square

  the five heads of his companions had
been planted on stakes distorted carica-
tured mitris face alone had conserved its
look of insolent superiority and the blood-
less lips curved slightly as though in con-
temptuous amusement sanglier one eye
staring the other half dosed appeared to
wink leeringly at his corporal personne
shuddered and turned away

  weakened and nauseated by the loss of
blood his bruised body half numb the hours
dragged by endlessly the sun began to
decline the heat grew less yet thirst
made his tongue thick and raspy the
guard must have noticed that he frequently
licked his lips for he called out lustily and
a youth brought a pail of water this was
spilled slowly upon the ground this was
repeated many times before the coolness of
the night made itself felt and the black
flags emerged from the bush one by one

  women and children materialized out of
nowhere the gurgling shouting squealing
multitude milled around the square in and
out of the huts-cooked quarreled played
games paused in front of him and jeered
in vain he looked for his little friend of
the pagoda and yet why did he look
surely she did not belong in this ul-smelling
swarm

  he began to wonder what would be his

  lot what refinements of suffering they
might drag him around the interior in a
bamboo cage feeding him on offals loath-
some beyond description or be content to-
night with a few minor operations such as
tearing out his finger nails or slicing off his
nose to-morrow they could spread-eagle
him under the noonday sun with his eye-
lids cut off and his fingers stretched open
by little pegs or they might skin him
alive or give him the water cure or a
simpler method repeated blows on the soles
of his feet until he went mad or died

   personne sought to compose himself to
 hide every trace of fear or agony when
 another bucket of water splashed down in
 front of him and sank into the dusty soil
 a fat silk-clad mandarin spoke a few words
 gravely as a quiet gentleman orders his din-
 ner the corporal was lifted carried to the
 hut nearest the recently kindled fire and se-
 curely fastened by wrists and ankles limbs
 outstretched on a framework formed like
 the letter x the flags had a wholesome
 respect for the hard fists of the legionaire
 and were careful to free him by degrees a
 hand a foot one at a time attached se-
 curely before passing on to the next when
 operations were at last completed the frame
 was elevated and braced against a wall
 personnes full weight being bome by wrists
 and ankles

  the crowd then gathered josded and
pushing the smaller boys worked their
way to the front rank as he remembered
having done himself to watch circus parades
from the swarm of yellow faces came a
cheerful expectant buzz -the thongs cut
into personnes flesh until merciful numb-
ness gave momentary ease then his tor-
mentors pushed his head as far back as pos-
sible without snapping the vertebra and
fastened it in that position with a leather
strap around his neck a round piece of
wood was then inserted between the frame
and the small of his back the strain on
the muscles was terrific perspiration bead-
ed his forehead and the blood from his
gashed wrists trickled down his arms to the
elbows

  a drop of moisture on his head his
heart leaped-rain he remembered having
cursed the rain that morning-and now-
six good men



ah--smother drop he protruded his
tongue with the thought that-perhaps-
but when he understood he smothered a
groan for hours he would feel that steady
dripping always the same quantity at exact
intervals at precisely the same spot on his
skujl until the pain and the unceasing wait
for the next drop would drive him mad

  with sudden desperation he strained at
the ropes which drove the straps but deep-
er he could move his head a trifle a
fraction of an inch he would be careful
to do this quietly or they would see him and
take away his last comfort then realiz-
ation came to him that this was also planned
to prolong the agony

  the leader came close and regarded him
critically personne spat in the fat yellow
face thinking to bring things to a close
but the flag wiped his cheek and joined the
others the drops fell-and fell at least
an hour passed the pain was excruciating
and he ceased to be able to move the half-
paralyzed neck muscles his swollen eye-
balls seemed ready to burst-the yellow
faces-the firelight danced and swung be-
fore him and he was thirsty he thought
of water-waterfalls foaming and crashing
down deep chasms lakes with clear fresh
water transparent and showing golden sand
and round pebbles at the bottom the sea
roaring in his ears

  now his head was a huge anvil and
gigantic hammers were pounding on it five-
ton hammers that beat regularly and would
never stop thump-thump-his neck
would stand a little more he shifted a frac-
tion the drop fell on that spot and soon
it too was being pounded away by the great
pile drivers he laughed loudly

iii

  the chinaman is only stolid on occasion
he knowhow to enjoy himself the on-
lookers-rocked with mirth the mandarin
chuckled softly yes he could make white
men crazy more foolish than the fat babies
who played with the swine in the dung
the victims usually held out longer but this
sea devil had been weakened by his wound
and the hot sun

when they unfastened personne he fell

to the ground and lay motionless he was
harmless crazy they would keep him
from sharp weapons and watch him they
laughed again when he sat up and stared
around vacantl  unsteadily he got to his
feet and wabbled about in search of water
after having been given a drink he threw
the bowl high in the air and laughed they
laughed with him and followed as he stag-
gered toward the five stakes on the opposite
side of the square

  he saluted the heads of his dead com-
rades with a broad wave then he ha-
rangued in a loud voice pointing first to the
east then the west he shook his fists
groaned spat sobbed then he relived the
fight-lunged out with a bayonet though
his hand held no weapon ducked yataghan
strokes wrestled with a phantom foe ran
to the spot where the white men had formed
the hollow square and reacted every blow
every killing he went down in imitation
of pat fell to his knees as mitri shrieked
as sanglier had done

  the black flags recognized the moves
and their amusement increased here was a
madman with a memory as he kicked and
punched into space more than one rubbed
his bruises gingerly personne turned and
approached the headless bodies of his men
which had been laid out in line awaiting
a leisurely division of the spoils

  the single chinese soldier on watch
moved back as he approached personne
tapped each body on the chest and loudly
called out a name then he straightened
up with a dazed vacant stare fumbling
in his pocket he pulled out an imaginary
revolver the guard laughed loudly this
was superior comedy bang bang
the corporal shouted in imitation of the re-
volvers bark and moved toward the pa-
goda turning and shouting at intervals
bang bang

  with a few quick words the chief ordered
him brought back to the fire the guard
approached the same who had watched over
the legionaire earlier in the day the cor-
poral shrank away and laughter again rose
from the spectators suddenly without
warning the sea devil seized the chinaman
around the waist with one arm lifted him
off the ground placing his free hand under

the chin and forcing the head back a
brief struggle the natives legs kicking wild-
ly in the air his hand fumbling for the dirk
at his belt then the flags neck snapped
and he grew limp

  for a moment personne faced the on-
rushing crowd the body in his arms his
face demoniacal in the red fire glow then
with a mighty effort he hurled the dead
man among his comrades and with another
crazy inarticulate moan made for the
pagoda

   the three officers of the advanced guard
depressed and worried sat around the fire

   i feel like a murderer the major de-
clared at length

   war is war- the naval lieutenant
tried to console him

    i hope they didnt take him alive put
in the captain

  there was a long silence the majors
pipe went out and he forgot to relight it
 i hope personne died fighting he said
shortly when the oppression grew too
heavy  thats the way he would have
liked-

  the others nodded the unpleasant topic
was not mentioned again

  a sharp challenge indistinct shouting
and footsteps approaching rapidly the
sudden commotion brought them to their
feet startled his torso bare streaked with
the dark stains of dried blood a disheveled
white man staggered into the firelight

the romance of food

  fter it was all over springtimes
 mind reverted to what was to him
  the most important thing about the
whole ball game just what effect it would
have on his relations with osborne they
were sitting in the stable and in spring-
times pocket was durkins money-fifty
and a bit over

 osborne was pleased-so pleased that as
he sat in the old swivel chair he whistled
a tune between his teeth and beat the long
roll with his finger tips the corncob
smoked in one fist and on the old mans face
was an expression of gentle good humor
which springtime had never seen there be-
fore all the indications were good and he
began to spar for an opening

   its been one strenuous week

   where did you find that lad asked
osborne who all through the week had not
asked a word of explanation from spring-
time about where or how he got his recruit

   out in the jungles ive seen him off
and on for some long time but i never did
know he was a ball player

   springtime said osborne who had
picked the name up from hearing durkin
speak it  youll have to admit that there
arent many men in the world who would
trust such an important thing as finding a
pitcher to a man he had not known any
longer than i know you my lord when
i think of how i first met up with you i
wonder why i havent had you in the cala-
boose

  he chuckled and springtime reddened at
the thought of the agony he had gone

thii ttory began in the argoiy-aiutory weekly for september

 through to get that bit of pie he said
 nothing but watched the water dripping
 from the trough in a stream made golden by
 the sun

    how are you getting along with your
 work asked osbome after a long pull on
 the corncob

   springtime answered warily  oh
 so-so

    the market will be opening pretty
 soon said osborne  and i might be able
 to plant a few bushels of extra fancy hand-
 picked beans provided you get em done
 before they turn to dust

     so youre expecting me said the wan-
 derer  to go on and finish that job

    why not

     after i went out and got a pitcher for

 you

     i dont see that that has anything to do
 with it i didnt ask you to did i and
 we had no agreement to the effect that if
 you got me a pitcher you could lay off sort-
 ing beans you volunteered to get me a ball
 player and i told you to go ahead but i
 said nothing and you said nothing about
 stopping that particular job i put you on

 i make it a rule never to refuse when a man
 comes along and offers to do me a service
 springtime jumped to his feet

     where would you have been if i hadnt
 got that man for you

    right where i am now returned os-
 bome with another long pull on his pipe

  and let me give you some advice-you
 spend too much energy in getting het up
 over trifles the man that gets there is
 the man who economizes force there is
 more than one good pitcher in the world-
 probably a dozen within fifty miles of here
 that could pitch rings around that loafer

  but you hadnt found one and im
 darned if i think you could have found
 one 

  ill take a chance on that you dont
 think i didnt have any pitchers in reserve
 do you

 springtime felt that he was battering his
 head against a stone wall and sat down
 again on his straw bale and gripped his
 hands to hold down the safety valve the
 worst of it was that osborne was right
 there had been no agreement between them

    you dont understand he said realiz-
ing that if osborne knew the whole truth
from his lips he would be betraying durkin
 i saved that game for you durk has to
be handled with gloves and-where would
you have been if it hadnt been for me

    i dont know and i dont care said
osbome who was putting the finish on a
perfect day  what you are talking about
has nothing to do with picking beans the
thing for you to do is to get it into your
head once and for all that i have the dope
on you and it  be easier for everybody if
you kick in and sort beans i have a darned
good notion that it will be good for you

    im not a hard man-what youve done
so far wouldnt keep a canary in bird seed
and ive been feeding you for a couple of
weeks but ill forget all that and well start
over again ill give you your board and
one bushel out of every five that you finish
that one bushel is yours and you can eat
it or turn it into cash or throw it away just
as you please and there never was a bean-
picker as well paid as that in this vale of
tears and i hang only one provision on it-
youll have to do so much a day

 i havent figured it out yet but  have
to make some sort of condition like that or
youd be here the rest of your life id like
to see what you would do with eight bushels
of beans once you got them and i
w ouldnt go tearing off over the countryside
either because youll only get yourself
caught and brought back come along its
time to go up to the house

 eight bushels of beans  gasped spring-
time  meaning  have to do forty alto-
gether 

osborne nodded

 thats it youre quick at figures but
ill change that-ill make it that you have
to do twenty-and then doing the other
twenty will be optional maybe he con-
cluded with a grin  youll like it so well
when you get twenty bushels done that
youll wtant to do all the beans in town
springtime was too hot to speak he sat
gripping his arms and crowding back the
flood of hard words that rushed to his lips
osbome repeated his invitation to come to
the house but springtime although he real-
ized that he was caught did not move

                        	a
the bird of passage



   shift darn you  shouted his jailer and
inch by inch he got up and putting on his
own coat followed the old man into the
house where he went straight upstairs and
to bed without his supper he was undis-
turbed although he could hear the hall floor
creaking under mrs osbornes tread it
was simply impossible for him to sit at the
same table with tom osborne without blow-
ing off in some way

  in the morning he was back in the gal-
vanized iron jail with his beans around him
but so sick for freedom that he did not
plunge his hand once into the bins it was
a physical impossibility for him to do so-
his mind told him that there were only
twenty bushels of the cursed vegetable be-
tween him and freedom yet he could not
drag himself to work just as the schoolboy
knows that unless he gets his history lesson
there will be hard times in school yet can-
not bring himself to study that lesson it
was real torture and springtime looked
back on those few days on the road with
durkin with a passionate homesick longing
as being the best days he had ever spent and
likely to be the best days he ever would
spend

  in mid-morning he had a visitor-dur-
kin who had a faculty for smelling out the
hiding places of anybody there was a
curious change in durkin for in spite of the
fact that he had not yet been paid for his
labor he was wearing a new pair of shoes
he walked into the shed and looked about
him

   is this your studio old chap

  yes

   rumor hath it that you have some coin
for me

  springtime gave him the envelope and
his fellow wanderer put it in his pocket
without even opening it-absolute proof
that he was a great man if ever one lived
it was a tribute not only to the honesty of
springtime but to the generosity of his em-
ployer and at the same time a hint that
after all money was only a rather inconveni-
ent way of exchanging values he sat down
on one of the bins and brushed some dust
from his sleeve that coat had already
been brushed so that it was cleaner than
the one tom osborne wore there were
 a

other queer signs about durkin of some sort
of regeneration new necktie and shined

shoes

  durkin looked with some amusement at
the measures and bins and beans on the
floor and remarked  soft job this

   sure it is said springtime warmly
 durk why dont you come over and get
the old boy to give you a job too all you
have to do is to pick the dark ones out of
the light ones or the light ones out of the
dark ones for every five bushels i do i get
one-all my own to sell hock or throw
in the river you stick here and help me
get this done and then well beat it to-
gether

  durkin raised his finger and shook his
head

   no thanks my boy theres too much
sameness about that job and im not beat-
ing it just yet springtime this towns a
gold mine 

   now look here durk said springtime
in alarm  remember im responsible for
bringing you here and if anything should
happen id be the goat

   dont worry-dont worry this is all
inside the law just slip down to the star of
life mission some night thats where im
living from now on

  springtime stared at durkin but could
read nothing in his face except a lively
satisfaction with himself and his prospects

  mission said springtime you
dont mean youre panhandling the sky-
pilots

   better than that said durkin  much
much better and getting up he walked to
the door

   is that where you got the new kicks
asked springtime but the other turned
around with a significant wave of the hand
and was gone

  the toiler had no interruptions until noon
-not even spells of work until osborne
came in he glanced at the empty meas-
ures and said nothing but opening bin
after bin ran his hands deep into the con-
tents and let them trickle through his fin-
gers he made the rounds of the shed and
said  did you ever think about the ro-
mance of food

   what


argosy-allstory weekly

    i said the romance of food young fel-
low exclaimed osborne

    no is there such a thing

    ill tell a man there is wars have
been won on these things -letting a hand-
ful fall back into the bin- and nations are
going to hell for lack of em body build-
ers strong boys and healthy men i dont
suppose you have ever thought of what
broom-maldng means to the world

    i cant say that i have

    it could hardly be expected of you
but think of what the broom means no
brooms in the middle ages-black death
sweeps em off think of all the houses that
are livable and happy because of brooms-
take the broom away and the house becomes
a hovel take brooms away and the death
rate doubles in a week now if you were in
the broom business wouldnt that mean
something to you-wouldnt it make you
want to turn out good ones better than any
one else ever turned out but of course i
couldnt expect a roamer like you to see
that

    im not a roamer said springtime
clenching his teeth  im a bum-a plain
american bum if i am its my affair im
happy to be one and the day i shake the
dust of this town from my feet will be the
happiest in my life ill celebrate it the way
the frogs do bastille day

    bastille said osborne with a leer
 thats french for jail isnt it

    yes

   springtimes tormentor laughed loudly as
though he had seen something extremely
funny and looking springtime up and down
traced circles in the air as though he were
painting him with stripes

    well he said in the best of humor

 nature has its freaks man was born
to work and women to weep although i
dont believe the last of that old wheeze

i do believe the first but there are all sorts
of freaks in nature spinster moose that live
by themselves and wont take a mate and
hermit beaver that wont be bothered with
family cares nature makes a little mistake
once in a while but not often and when she
does she takes care of it quick no matter
how many loafers there are there will al-
ways be enough workers to keep things go-

ing and theyll always manage to make life
hell for the ones that dont work

     preach on 

     yes i enjoy casting pearls once in a
 while i dont give a darn what becomes of
 you after you get this job done but ive
 just naturally got it into my fool head that
 youve got to do it when do you think
 you can get twenty bushels finished

    never so help me ill never touch
 another bean as long as i live 

    rather work in a quarry huh said
 the old man  thats where they put em
 in this state slim mccabe was a guard
 up there before he came down here and
 cleaned this town up and ive heard he was
 a spring lamb compared to the rest of em
 im onto you young fellah me lad and if
 ever i cut loose therell be hell popping for
 you

   oh get to hell out of here raged
 springtime

     no im going to the house for lunch
 returned his tormentor  i guess you dont
 feel like coming no all right

   he walked out and left the door wide
 open-and all the way to the house he was
 chuckling mrs osborne was at one of
 her interminable luncheons kitty was silent
 all through the meal but as he went to-
 ward the door after it she backed him into
 a comer took him by the coat lapels and
 said  ive got to know just whats going
 on what have you done with him why
 isnt he here

    ive done nothing with him

    come through babv eves where is
 he

    down in the bean shed-mad as a hor-
 net hed have lammed me if i had stayed
 a minute longer

     look here old-timer you dont think
 he had anything to do with that hold-up do
 you

   well im not saying said osborne
 and tried to look forbidding

   kitty shook him - rather she went
 through the motions for he stood as solid
 as rock and she moved

  you know you dont think so she said

  and ive got to know what you are up
to what deviltry is going on within that
handsome head now
the bird of passage



     im just having a little fun said os-
  borne  he hates picking beans worse than
  a boy hates to be spanked im just trying
  to see what a hobo is good for

chapter xviii

the liberator

after her father had gone kitty
walked swiftly down to the tin shed
the prisoner was sitting in his chair
with his back to the bin and kittys
quick eye read in his face real suffering
he was white and his cheeks were
drawn as if he were under torture she was
certain that he was thinner than on the
day he had first become acquainted with
beans beads of perspiration stood out on
his forehead and while his chair was tipped
back in a lounging position she could see
that every muscle in him was strung up
reach for an explosion of some sort kitty
clasped her hands tight to keep down that
feeling which came over her-a feeling
which if it was not pity was closely akin
to it she walked quickly across to him
and laid her hand on his shoulder

   its a shame said she  to put a man
like you at work like this you simply cant
do it can you

   they have me stopped

   id feel the same about putting a mus-
tang on a milk wagon said kitty  as i
would about putting you at this work i
wish you were out of here-for your sake
oh dont i returned springtime in
a passion of longing  dont i id travel
in a reefer a thousand miles and think it was
great girl you dont know what it means
to be shut up

  his eyes were on the open door and his
face was hungry

   why dont you go

  jail ive always kept out of jail if
i hate this think what i would feel in jail
id die

   you would said kitty  and im
thinking that if you stay here youll die or
come close to it its different with you-
when the time comes for you to move you
have to thats all you go i simply cant
stand by and see a mans heart broken

   if i have to stand this any longer-ill
do murder 

    skip along then and ill fix it so that
you wont have to worry about anything
i know you didnt have anything to do with
that hold-up nobody believes you did-
least of all me and i honestly think dad
doesnt believe it hes trying you out
hell do anything i set my heart on and
when he comes home to-night ill tell him
i let you out and that if he does anything
about it ill leave home too i can come
close enough to it to throw a good scare
into him now the thing for you to do is to
go

   springtime got to his feet slowly incredu-
lously as though he could not believe in this
freedom that had come so suddenly he
crossed the floor in three long noiseless
strides and looked out the door and up at
the sky

   and as for johnny said kitty  i
have a scheme-a scheme for getting him
home we know he lives somewhere in this
state where theres a ball team well get
a picture of him and send it around and if
his mothers alive shell see it and send for
him we can find out every town here that
has a ball club in it and have the picture
printed in the paper and a lot of publicity
given to it so you neednt worry about
that

  springtime looked at her and said slowly

 youre the most wonderful girl-

   good-by said kitty breathlessly and
held out her hand

  springtime came back to her step by
step his face puzzled for it had suddenly
come over him that much as he wanted to
get away it was not easy to leave kitty
behind him little by little the sw-eetness
of her her fresh beauty had stolen in upon
him and twisted in among his heartstrings
so that now with freedom before him he
stood looking stupidly down into the glo-
rious brown eyes and fumbled for words

   kitty  he said in a low voice  honey
girl 

  kittys eyes did not waver although they
were misty

   springtime she whispered

  then his arms went about her and drew
her up so that she stood on tiptoe and their


argosy-allstory weekly

lips met in one binding kiss with that kiss
and with the firm young body within the
circle of his arms springtime felt as though
he had been neatly cut in two by a mar-
velously clean scimitar one-half of him
loved kitty adored her would never be
happy unless near her arid always miser-
able away from her the other half of him
was his wandering self and even while he
stood with kittys smooth cheek against
his own saying over and over again  kitty
girl i love you and she murmured
 springtime my dear-my dear that half
of him rose strongly and told him that he
was a wanderer a hobo unfit to be her hus-
band that he would never be able to keep
her in gingham aprons even and that the
best thing he could do would be to get out
of that shed as fast as his legs would carry
him

   after an indeterminate period of time in
 which the sun spots moved across the floor
 and the mice came out and larked in the
 quiet kitty tilted her head back and look-
 ing into springtimes face said  do you
 want to go-now

  at the question he could not meet the
 luminous eyes which in spite of the great
 love for her which welled up in him were
 somehow frightening so he said nothing
 and kitty smiling wisely spoke with a lilt
 of sheer joy in her voice

    thats not real living springtime-just
 wandering from one place to another real
 life is in homes im a fine little cook oh
 it will be too wonderful 

   and springtime could tell by the long
 breath she drew that for kitty a home
 wrould be marvelous-the home he could
 not give her in a hundred years he felt
 that long sweet intake in a panic of cold
 misery he tried tq draw away from her
 but such was the strength of his love that
 he could not

    honey he said  i couldnt possibly
 give you all that-never

    ill take part said kitty  a little at
 a time when my grandfather married my
 grandmother they didnt have a thing
 guess what they paid the minister with 
 beans said springtime with a pro-
 phetic groan

    yes laughed kitty as full of joy as a

 song sparrow  they rode two on one
 horse to the minister with a sack of beans
 in front of the saddle they had all they
 needed to make them happy and before
 they died they were rich and i dont
 want to be rich-that isnt what makes
 people happy dear

    springtime listened to her with a thrill
  of pure delight but behind it was a dark
  duty to perform and he said  i couldnt
  give you even a part of it

     why not asked kitty with perfect
 trust which comes with a newly revealed
 love  it isnt so hard

     dont you know what i am im a
 man without a trade without a cent to his
 name all my life ive been roaming-im
 just a hobo

    kitty put her hand over his mouth and
 stopped him

     i wont have you saying such things
 about yourself ive heard that word for
 the last time in my life ive known what
 you were from the first-ive known you
 were a gentleman no matter what you
 might be doing and thats enough you
 have good blood back of you and ability
 and i know-i just know-that you could
 do anything you could put your hand to
 my dad thinks so too and he never makes
 mistakes isnt it wonderful she bub-
 bled  i dont even know your last
 name 

     its mclouth said springtime laugh-
  ing with her in spite of himself- david
  mclouth my father was a village doctor
  and my uncle ran the store where im sup-
  posed to be now i started there but i
  couldnt stand it and i began running away
  when i was fifteen-at first in the spring
  every spring thats how i got my moni-
  ker-i mean my nickname-because i al-
  ways turned up on the road along in april
  thats why they called me springtime

   its a lovely name said kitty and
began trying over combinations mrs da-
vid mclouth mrs springtime mclouth
and even plain mrs springtime  im al-
ways going to call you springtime and i
think ill have people call me mrs spring-
time thats wonderful

  they both saw how wonderful it was-
so wonderful that there was nothing for him
the bird of passage



to do but to draw kitty up on her toes
again and seal it with a kiss there was
another long spell of quiet in which the
mice ventured forth again and then kitty
said dreamily 

   dad will be pleased hes queer-he
likes men and im sure he thinks more of
you right now than of all the rest of us
put together i reckon youve got to be
the son he ought to have had ive done
my best and ive done a pretty good job
considering the handicap hes crazy about
you just the way he was about an old
chap who lived next door to us he and
dad used to fish together but when the old
man died my poor pops moped for weeks
springtime took himself in hand and
moved away from her and taking her by
the wrists looked down into the brown
eyes with their russet glints

   you listen he said tensely  because
sooner or later youll find out im talking
straighter to you than ive ever talked in
my life im just a plain footloose guy i
began running away when i was big enough
to walk and ive been running ever since
god knows what it is that keeps me mov-
ing but something does-and its the
strongest thing in my life ive tried to
quit before and ive sworn up and down
i would but sooner or later im off again
kitty girl i couldnt settle down-im
afraid-not even for you

  saying that was the bravest thing spring-
time had ever done-a thing compared to
which fighting gahagan was childs play

it stabbed him to the heart to hear her
quick breath and to see her cheek pale
and he tried to draw her to him but she
held his gaze with one hand on his cheek

   springtime she said slowly  you do
love me dont you

   i do kitty  do love you

   and i love you and always shall but
i should think that if you loved me you
would want to be with me thats the way
it is with me

   honey he cried  weve simply got to
forget each other

   but that isnt so easy said kitty
quietly  suppose i cant

  springtime put his head in his hands and
cursed himself silently

   kitty slipped her hand to his shoulder

and gripped it

    i understand i wouldnt be much if
i didnt things will come out all right
if we are only patient you stay with us
a while just as long as you can stand it
and then when you must move ill let
you go and will you promise me just one
thing

    yes god knows there is little enough
i can do for you

    all i ask is that you stay long enough
to finish this-this job that dad has given
you will you

   i will said springtime nodding sol-
emnly  so help me kitty ill try to fin-
ish these damn beans if it kills me 

    it wont said kitty with a laugh

 they arent so bad all they tuce is-

    dont say it cried springtime as he
put up his hand  that word  patience 
is the word i fight on 

   kitty looked about her at the bins and
the peck measures and the loose beans on
the floor

   how much have you done to-day

    not a one

  kitty walked firmly to the door and
looked up at the sun

    it must be about four now well have
about two hours to work in-you and i
springtime between us were going to beat
this game

chapter xix

the great idea

osborne let out a bellow when he
found kitty at work beside spring-
time-such a bellow that she de-
cided under the circumstances not to say
anything but to let springtime carry on the
great work by himself for four days he
worked hard-at least it was hard work
for nim-and finished one bushel then the
realization that it would take him eighty
days to do twenty bushels stopped him as
neatly as a right hook to the jaw

    well whats wrong with you asked
osborne as he he came in one noon and
found that the mornings work amounted to
just nothing  you look sick


argosy-allstory weekly

    i am sick do you know how long it
will take me to do twenty bushels

    oh two or three hours

    eighty days

    well what of it that isnt eternity
people have done worse things how do
you suppose a woman feels about washing
dishes day after day year in and year out
and ironing and all that sort of thing
son you dont know how lucky you are
how do you suppose a coal miner feels
about getting down into a mine and work-
ing ten hours without seeing the light you
dont know what a cinch you have-good
place to work with plenty of light and air
good wages-

   springtime jumped out of his chair as
though he had been stung he forced him-
self to be calm however and tried to make
his voice sound pacific and reasonable

    lets you and me have a square talk
i know youve got something on me-got it
good and plenty and im not soft enough
to blame you for making use of it because
if i had anything on you-man what i
would do to you would be a caution i
didnt have anything to do with shooting
holes in the top of your car but that isnt
the point because you think i did and you
have a good case more than one gun has
gone up the river for less than that im
not wasting my breath telling you im in-
nocent all i want to know is w-hat are
you going to do

   when springtime finished he was a bit
ashamed of himself for his voice had run
away with him osbornes eyes had never
shifted from him and he felt that after all
it must have been a rather kiddish exhibi-
tion

    i guess you mean what are you going
to do said the old man smoothly  well
first youre going up to the house for lunch
and after that i can tip you off in just one
word-beans

   springtime baffled dug his fingers into
 his palms to keep himself from yelling and
 did not move as osborne walked toward the
 door the old man waited for a full min-
 ute then turned and roared stir your
 stumps

   springtime had to follow-there was no
getting away from it osborne had him

 maybe the only thing that saved osborne
 from personal assault as they moved to-
 ward the house was the fact that he did not
 look over his shoulder

   but he was an unaccountable man after
 lunch he took springtime for a long drive
 in the country-a drive that took most of
 the afternoon-and all that time his talk
 was man-to-man talk with never a mention
 of the hard white vegetables that waited
 for springtime in the tin house it was
 about horses dogs fights politics crops-
 without a word about mccabes jails or
 the fact that the young man with him
 was as much in his power as prometheus in
 the power of the vulture

   when they returned springtime was
 soothed happy almost indifferent and
 though his feet dragged when he went to
 the bean shed he was able to sit down and
 work hard enough for an hour partly to fill
 a peck measure some of it he used to fill
 out the first bushel for as he looked at it
 it seemed to be a rather skimpy one he
 poured a few handfuls in and then leveled
 it off until it was perfectly even with per-
 haps a slight swelling upward in the middle
 to show that if there were any error in
 measurement it was on the side of fullness
 rather than the other way

   kitty came in as he was smoothing it
 off when she saw what he was doing she
 said springtime

    the worker stood in front of his bushel
 which it had taken five days to do with
 nineteen bushels yet undone and really
 felt a little pride in his work and also with
 the undone bushels in his minds eye a little
 ashamed to be proud of it but there was
 no doubt about kitty-she was tremen-
 dously proud of him and said so

 its wonderful she said  too mar-
velous for words one whole bushel done
springtime looked at it and shook his
head with the melancholy pride that the
old soldier feels at being under the worst
top sergeant in the army

  it wasnt so bad now was it coaxed
kitty  it didnt kill you after all did
it

  close enough

 but just think how much more fun it
would have been if you had plowed for
the bird of passage



them and harrowed and sowed the seed and
harvested them and then picked them
over and sold them at something over the
top price because they were the best beans
ever raised wouldnt that have been fun
springtimes wild half shouted an em-
phatic no although the rest of him
looked at kitty and said  yes but he
shook his head and waved his hand about
at the beans which remained to be done

   it took me four days to do that bush
el and then i havent really done anything
to-day that means that it will take me
a hundred days to do twenty bushels or
ninety-five days for the nineteen left that
i have to do ninety-five days thats
over three months 

   nonsense  said kitty  youll get to
be much slicker at it as time goes along and
then youll work harder every day ill bet
it wont take you a day over two months
increased production-thats what you
want and you can get it because people
actually make money doing this and they
dont get anywhere near as good pay as dad
is giving you

   do they all do it by hand

   i dont know-maybe not i think in
some big places they have machines of some
kind but they have to have people to run
them just the same i never did get it
quite straight-maybe the machines are for
something else but i mustnt stay and
bother you you get along to work and in
two months from now youll have every last
bean done

  two months exclaimed springtime
with feeling as he watched her go

  by that time it would be cold crossing
the great divide and it would be raining in
california but something told him that
cold or no cold he would go he stood for
a long time watching the door through
which kitty had gone for she had left a
seed which began to sprout flourish send
out branches and almost to bear fruit

  she had spoken of a machine-and there
sprang up in his mind a full-grown picture
of just the thing that he needed to get this
business done in six days instead of sixty
if only there were a moving band now
something that went around on two rollers
a sort of endless belt on which the beans

would drop out of a hopper that would
help for then as they went by one could
simply knock off the undesirables while the
others fell into a basket at the end of the

table

  table what table springtime whirled
and saw that his imagined machine had
built it itself on just such a table as that
before him going over to it he inspected
it it was a simple flat top with four legs
and if he could only find rollers that would
go on each end he could arrange a belt
which would go over the top of the table
and under the bottom

  something or somebody would have to
turn it but he could get a windmill or
a motor or something that point was a
minor one there flashed into his mind
a picture of rollers-somewhere he had seen
rollers and he slapped his hand against his
forehead and tried to recall rollers-where
were rollers out the window that was
it-every time he had looked out of the
window which had the best view he had
looked on the wreck of a wringer

  he dashed out into the side yard and
salvaged it from the junk heap-a ringer
with two fairly good rollers and a crank
he saw that with a few bolts he could
easily fix the rollers to ends of the table
and then somewhere he could find canvas
with which to make his band that was to
move on them

  aflame with his new idea he dashed into
the harness room of the bam and found
what tools he needed and in addition a
strip of awning whieh had evidently been
cast aside as useless it was full of holes
but there was enough canvas in it to make
a belt

  in a tin tobacco can was a complete har-
ness mending outfit-needles thread and a
thimble all of them he took back into
his shed but just as he had dismembered
the wringer he heard osbornes feet crunch-
ing on the cinders and he slipped out to the
stable before his jailer could come on him
and find what he was doing the time to
show it to osbome was when it worked-
not now luckily the old man did not offer
to go into the bean shed and when he asked
springtime how he was getting along the
toiler replied  fine


argosy-allstory weekly

   after supper he made a few cautious in-
quiries

    i should think he said  that no man
ought to do any work that a machine could
do

  osborne looked at him obliquely and
springtime felt that the old man knew
what he was driving at but he kept his
own face as bland as possible so that in-
stead of getting an insult he got a real
opinion

   youre right-as long as he can make
a machine do it as well as the man does it
remember this-that in america theres a
big market for machine-made things but
people still pay the top price for the hand-
made things americans want the best-
more than the best thats why you are
always seeing hand-made shoes advertised
and hand-loomed cloths and hand-picked
beans americans want quality and they
will pay for it

    but if the machine does it just as well
and faster

    no objection at all said osborne
 but remember that people will still pay
for the idea of a thing being hand worked
even if it isnt and a man has to be a
mite careful about advertising a thing as
being hand made when it isnt

   springtime said no more about his great
idea for sorting beans by machine but in
the morning for the first time he sprinted
to the shed within two hours he had
made something of it-his rubbers were
spinning smoothly one on one end of the
table and the other on the opposite

   making the belt took longer for it was a
question of cutting and sewing and that was
a new sort of thing altogether but by
noon he had the belt moving on the rollers
and if it had not been for the fact that he
did not want osborne to drop in on him
and see him working at this machine he
could have got that done by the time the
noon whistle at the plow works blew he
waited for the old man at the stable en-
trance and when osborne inquired how he
was getting along he answered him in his
most cheerful manner

  it was a great moment when with a
small packing box nailed to the table for a
hopper he turned the crank and saw the

beans moving past him in a broad stream
he made the band revolve with one hand
and picked out the dark beans with the
other and even in that awkward way he
could see that he was working faster than he
could by hand if only he had some one
to turn the crank now

   all the afternoon he worked on improve-
 ments such as hollowing the rollers slightly
 so that the load on the belt would not crawl
 off the edges and narrowing the slit in
 the packing box so that the beans would
 slip out onto the band in a layer just one
 deep when they were piled on top of each
 other the whole scheme went wrong he
 left it just before five as perfect as he could
 make it and went out to wait for osborne
 in front of the stable for the time was not
 yet ripe to show it to his jailer he had to
 have some one to turn the crank for him
 while be sorted the load he had no money
 and the only prospect he had of getting
 labor w-as from durkin after supper he
 slipped out to find the mission where dur-
 kin was staying

chapter xx

the convert

 like all good towns napoleon had a good
  section and a section which was not
 so good of course the railroad was
 the dividing line and springtime struck
 across the tracks to find the star of life
 mission

   napoleon with no factories beyond the
 plow works had a very small slum quarter
 and that slum quarter would have been in
 many towns a good residential section
 springtime wondered what the star of life
 mission could find to work with for the
 people seemed to be well-dressed healthy
 and contented as a matter of fact the star
 of life mission had been founded more for
 the benefit of the people who ran it than the
 people to be saved

 if there are no worthy objects of char-
ity one good woman is reported as saying

  what will become of good works

   good works there must be and certain
 of napoleons citizens who had the money
 to gratify such a hobby had founded the
the bird of passage



    star of life mission across the railway
    tracks and were on the hunt for converts

      springtime saw the electric sign winking
   and soon found himself entering what had
   once been a store building the windows
   were frosted except for a big red star paint-
   ed in the middle of each within the coun-
   ters had been cleared out giving a big floor
   space covered with common chairs all ar-
   ranged to face a platform on which stood
   a sort of reading desk close before it and
   slightly raised above the level of the floor
   was a bench and on that bench sat durkin
   the great man with his head bowed and his
   shoulders stooped every line of his figure
   expressing contrition regret and an earnest
   hope that he might enter into a better life
   as soon as the tall thin man above him
   stopped praying over him

     springtime slipped into a seat holding his
   cap tight over his mouth to keep down the
   laughter that always bubbled up when dur-
   kin was on any of his great schemes he
   glanced about him and saw that there were
   perhaps a dozen people old and young in
   the chairs that there were far corner rooms
   behind glass doors that there were a num-
   ber of big stoves in the mission

     take it all in all that wouldnt be a bad
place to live but it was really a bit below
durkin to try to get a job as janitor in
such a place for that seemed to be the line
of action which he had planned of course
a man could get clothing there and food
for a limited number of days but durkin
seemed to be full of admiration for the small
town and not only ready but glad to settle
down in it for good

  that could mean only one thing-he was
planning to become a hanger-on of the star
of life mission either a perpetual exhibition
as fruit of its work or janitor

  a feeling soprano during the hymn that
followed the prayer drew the wanderers
eyes to a plump woman who sat in the very
front row of seats springtime could not
see much of her beyond the fact that her
smooth coils of hair were comely that her
cheek was young and that the nape of her
neck was extremely white she sang with
her head up and whenever she struck a
rich high note a long quiver ran through
durkin and he groaned

   when the hymn was over durkin got
slowly and dramatically to his feet stepped
up to the platform and threw out his hand
the rest of the audience including spring-
time sat with its head up and its ears
pinned back so to speak anticipating some-
thing delicious that comely woman bowed
her head and covered her eyes with her
hands

   durkin tipped his head back and fixed his
eyes on a point just above the transom in
the high door where he seemed to see some-
thing of thrilling importance when he
spoke his voice was hollow and low and full
of feeling

    friends he said  i want to tell you
to-night what the star of life mission has
done for me i want to tell you how wicked
i was and how lost in the ways of evil un-
til a kind friend took me by the hand and
showed me a better way

here his eyes descended for a moment
from the point above the transom to the
bowed woman at his feet  friends i have
been wicked-no one knows but me and
the powers above and the powers below
how bad i have been if i should bare this
black soul to you you would all recoil
from me-recoil as at the sight of a serpent
with its head raised and its fangs bared

a shudder from some and loud cries from
others

 i have been a drunkard and a gambler
and a bearer of false witness-night after
night i have rolled besotted in the gutter
day after day i have sat at the table with
wild companions and listened to the clink
of gamblers gold not so long ago i was
tempted-i undertook to do a thing for my
neighbor and gave him my solemn promise
to do it and his enemy came and stood at
my side and said  do not this thing and
i will give you the wherewithal to buy silks
and satins and fine raiment and wines and
strong drinks

 and i hearkened to him friends but
before i could accomplish my wicked in-
tent another came and stood at my right
hand and told me not to do it i had a
glimpse then of a good angel watching me
and i could not do it and i went to the
traducer and said  i cannot do your devils
work for you

  tremulous cries came from the audience
-cries of gladness that durkin had been
saved from sin durkin brought his gaz
down again to the woman at his feet who
was sobbing outright

  springtime sat with his head bowed in
his hands as it came over him that this em-
broidered story had its beginning in the
attempt to throw the great hanover-xa-
poleon ball game he had known that
durkin was good but he had not known
how good and as he struggled with his
laughter he saw a delicious picture of him-
self and the convert traveling the rest of
their days together and recalling at least
once a day this scene in the star of life
mission he knew that durkin was lazy
but he knew that he was harmless too fas-
tidious to let himself roll in any gutter
and never having enough money on him
to gamble much

   the mark of cain is on my brow said
durkin in a terrible voice  or would have
been if my hand had not been stayed mirac-
ulously i have wandered in the valley of
darkness friends and i would be there now
if heaven had not sent a guide to put my
feet into the path of right living  have
drunk deep-i have coveted my neighbors
house and lot my tongue has been soiled
with profanity and-

  he stopped and threw himself back on
the mourners bench while shouts of thanks-
giving over him and a hymn arose spontane-
ously that hymn led to another and the
meeting came to its dose with springtime
beginning to see the light durkin with-
out the adornment which his smooth tongue
had given him would not have been half as
interesting if he had been a common
drunk people would have passed him by
but no one can ignore a really bad man

  springtime joined in the hymns lustily
for he liked a rousing tune as all good wan-
derers do and when everything was over he
drifted forward in an attempt to see durkin
there was a ring around the sinner which
he could not break through durkin was
the one who broke it and as he came down
the aisle with his hat in his hand that same
comely woman who had sat in the front row
was on his arm

  springtime had a good look at her and

 approved durkins taste she was blue-eyed
 with a skin like rose petals flushed just
 now to a deep color by her recent weeping
 durkin looked full at springtime and the
 latter was in a panic for a moment for
 fear the great man would drag him forward
 as a fit subject for conversion but durkin
 while looking at him made absolutely no
 sign of recognition springtime understood
 and as the two went down the street he
 followed at a distance

   they crossed the tracks to the good side
 of town and not only to the good side of
 town but to the best part of the good side
 they stopped at the gate of a comfortable
 house standing far back from the street-a
 place as solid and substantial as govern-
 ment bonds springtime whistled faintly
 to let durkin know that he was waiting for
 him and loitered under a tree until he heard
 the slamming of a door then stepped out to
 meet durkin he fell into step with him
 and the two walked dowii into the business
 section without saying a word

   the change in rollers pal was complete
 he was no longer durkin the hobo but
 thomas durkin gentleman and although
 there had not been much of an actual
 change in his clothes beyond the new shoes
 tie and collar he looked the gentleman from
 head to fool he walked the street with
 a faintly possessive and patronizing air as
 if although he might not be mayor he was
 at least a heavy taxpayer with an interest
 in pavements and street lights he stopped
 to look in at the windows of merchandise
 as though there were nothing that it was not
 within his power to buy

   when they came to the station park
 where there were secluded benches under
 trees durkin led the way to the darkest
 of them and lighted a cigarette he settled
 back with one long leg crossed over the
 other and drew a luxurious inhalation that
 seemed to go to his very toes springtime
 was delicately silent if durkin wanted to
 let him into his secret he would in his own
 good time a secret current of sympathy
 ran between them and when their cigarette
 ends burned bright they turned to look into
 one anothers faces

  good old springtime said durkin
finally  whats up do your feet itch
the bird of passage



   they do bad main they do

   why dont you drift if you want to
go-perhaps it would be as well not to wait
for me if you were holding off on my
account-

   i cant go said springtime bitterly
i cant

  durkin finished his cigarette thoughtfully
and lighted another

   some one must have something on you
old chap he said  i cant see what else
would be keeping you here

  springtime sketched in brief but telling
language the history of his relations with
tom osbome and at the end of that vivid
recital durkin whistled

   hes got you son its a peach if he
were a percentage copper now he could
shake you down for the rest of your life
and you would have to come through he
could frame you for the pen in just ten
seconds and all the old boy asks is that
you pick over twenty bushels of beans he
must be a nut but you dont know your
own luck my boy for w-hen it comes to a
choice between living in a good house and
picking over a few beans and living in a
jail and breaking rock there is really just
one answer-just one

  springtime spoke of his need of a helper
to turn the crank of his bean machine but
durkin shook his head

   springtime i make it a rule never to
go back i passed that sort of work years
ago as a matter of fact i can say that i
never began it you know how actors are-
if they have had a job at fifty a week theyll
starve before they will take one on at forty-
nine thats me and i think it is a pro-
foundly right attitude

   ive got to have somebody said
springtime  and i havent any money and
no way of making anybody do it boy
wouldnt i like to have something on old
osbome id make him turn that crank
the rest of his life

  durkin ran his hands through all of his
pockets and brought out a few small silver
pieces

  theres every cent i have he said
 every solitary cent and its yours if you
need it ive a little in prospect but it
wont materialize very quickly that fifty

i got at the ball game-springtime some-
times i think its a mistake to have too
many people about you who believe in you
i really had to do something for the lads
at the railroad house i will have to go
without smokes but maybe i can scrounge
some off the loafers around the station until
i can get some more

   no thanks all the same said spring-
time and pushed the hand away that offered
what durkin had

  they sat for a time in silence until a clock
struck then durkin arose and stretched
himself

   no late hours at the star of life he
said  i have to be in on time well
keep a stiff upper lip springtime and come
to see me again soon

  springtime watched durkin stroll awav
with a queer feeling of strangeness dur-
kin had stayed over to save him but he
had said nothing about rescue work that
night in fact had advised him to drift on
without waiting for him there was some-
thing in the wind what it was he could
not say except that it as bound to be good
for there was about all of durkins opera-
tions just that little super touch which lifted
them up into the realm of genius

  he went back to osbornes house still
not knowing where he could get any one to
turn his crank he had thought of kitty
but ruled her out at once for the reason that
he wanted to surprise her and the triumph
would be just that much greater if he could
get the thing going on his own initiative
he had also thought of johnny but there
were many reasons why johnny would not
do except as a last resort he doubted
whether or not the lad would stick and
johnny was too easily amused he would
probably find the whole situation very fun-
ny and would since he was the almost con-
stant companion of old osborne peddle his
amusement to the old man osborne had
enough onhim as it was

  he found johnny sitting on his bed with
some new treasures spread out before him
a knife with every known kind of blade in
it a half ball of blue chalk a small phial
of quicksilver a book on sleight-of-hand and
another on  how to play shortstop

  gee lamp this junk springtime he

 said  the old man gave it all to me
 this funny stuff in the bottle brings dead
 people up out of the water you bake it in
 a loaf of bread and then float it in the pond
 or river or whatever it is and it brings em
 right up to the surface that old boys
 a card springtime hes as regular a guy
 as ever breathed

    ah-huh said springtime

   he was wondering what the chances were
 of getting johnny to turn his crank and
 looking at the bright restless face he con-
 cluded that they were small johnny who
 was as neat as a cat brought out a little
 bundle of things wrapped up in oiled silk
 and untied it to put in it his two new books
 he tiptoed to the door and listened and then
 came back to the bed quivering with sup-
 pressed laughter

     ive sure been giving that jane of yours
 a swell time he said in a whisper  she
 asked me if she couldnt have a picture of
 me to put up on her mirror along with her
 other beaus and i said slire she could but
 i didnt have any so she allowed shed
 take one and asked me to come out on the
 lawn and pose for it i went along and she
 backed me up against the shrubbery and got
 the sun just right but just before she clicks
 the box i yanked my cap down over my
 face she must think im green to let any-
 body mug me that way

   all the time johnny had been telling
 about this scene in which springtime rec-
 ognized kittys plan to have the boys pic-
 ture broadcasted he had been working on
 his bundle and in that miscellaneous lot
 springtime saw what was probably the only
 picture of johnny-one which the professor
 had taken on the fair grounds the lad
 was posing as the checker marvel with his
 medal and a checker board in front of him

    she tries it again said johnny  and
 that time i made such a darned face that
 you couldnt have told whether it was me or
 a monkey  why johnny she says  i
 dont believe you want me to have a picture
 of you i told her i sure did and that id
 be a good boy and so she tries it again
 and that time i turned plunk around just as
 the thing went off so she got nothing but
 the back of my head after that i couldnt
 think of any other way to side-step it so i

 beat it she lets on shes pretty sore about
 it but what the hell what a boob id
 be to let anybody get my map into a pic-
 ture

     i went to a sunday school picnic the
  other day with the missis and they took a
  picture of the whole crew i sneaked off
  into the brush but some guy came pelting
  after me and got me and led me back by the
  ear but when the time comes for the guy
  to squeeze the bulb i just ducks around be-
  hind a fat girl and nobodys the wiser if
  a guys cagey theres nothing he cant slip
  over on these hicks

     yes said springtime  youre one wise
  kid

   and he marked just which comer of
 which drawer johnny used for the hiding
 place of his property the lad had to go
 home and by fair means or foul he intended
 to get that picture and have it copied then
 broadcasted johnny lay down and pulled
 the blankets up over him and was instantly
 on the verge of sleep

     say kid said springtime  how about
  doing a little work for me

     cant said johnny in a sleepy but
 prompt negative

    why not

     the old man wont let me he said if
  you asked me to help you to tell you to go
  to the devil

    that settled that

chapter xxi

high finance

 that picture of johnny as a checker
 playing marvel was in kittys hande
 early the next morning within an
 hour it was back in johnnys kit but in that
 hour it had been copied by a photographer
 and kitty had arranged a plot which seemed
 to have fair prospects of beating johnny at
 his own game of wariness

   i know a man on the newspaper here
said kitty with her eyes snapping  and i
told him about this wonderful checker-play-
ing boy and that i had a picture of him
he said it would make a good feature article
for some kind of syndicate he writes for and
that he would certainly like a chance to try
the bird of passage



  his hand at it and i told him to go ahead
and blessed him for it and finally i told him
the whole story on the promise that he
would print only as much of it as we wanted
printed he said he was sure it would be
printed in every town that was anywhere
big enough to have a ball team i told him
that it would not be wise to say anything
about this being a runaway boy and he
said it was taking all the punch out of the
narrative but he would go ahead and write
it and that it would be printed within a few
days

   but not in this towns paper said
springtime  if that boy got wind of it hed
slip out of our hands like water

   i thought of that said kitty  and
he said he could arrange that too isnt
it wonderful

  it was wonderful for johnny had long
ago ceased to be only amusing to spring-
time and had become a worry for always
in the back of his mind was the picture of
old bender as he had commissioned him to
convoy the lad home he accosted osborne
as the latter was leaving the stable for his
office and related the plot to him

    ill bet the little devil beats you was
the old mans comment  do you want to
make a sporting proposition of it

  no thanks but if youll step out to
this beanery for a minute ill show you
something

  osborne followed and springtime with
the palpitating heart of a mother showing
her first child to an audience of critical
relatives explained the mechanism

  you fill this box this way and when
the crank turns the belt moves and carries
the beans along in front of the operator
you knock the bad ones out this way its
a cinch i reckon i can work about ten
times as fast this way as the old way and
i swear to heaven that the beans that drop
off this end are as white as that china egg
you are always talking about there wont
be a dark one in the lot

  he went on volubly and passionately for
he knew that it lay in the old mans power
to scrap the whole thing and set him back
to working by hand if he did something
told him that there would be a revolt in the
tin shed and that the consequences to os-

  borne might be more or less permanent dis-
figurement and to himself more or less
permanent confinement in the county jail
perhaps osborne sensed what was in the
air and did not make any disparaging com-
ment he took the handle turned it ran
his hands over the rollers and the moving
band and finally said  lets see you do
some work on it ill turn the crank
springtime poured a few beans into the
hopper and osborne began to turn care-
fully never had the inventor worked with
more concentration for he knew that if one
or two dark-colored beans slipped past him
the invention went into the discard one
dark one would spell defeat at the end of
five minutes osborne stopped turning and
rubbed his chin

   well i dont like the idea but that may-
be because im getting out of date it
seems to work and as long as it does i dont
see just what i can do about it but how
are you going to make it turn you cant
crank it with one hand and pick beans with
the other

   thats the hell of it said the inventor

 i thought maybe i could get some work
somewhere for a day or two until id earned
enough to pay a helper

  osbome shook his head slowly

   i dont fancy the idea of your working
anywhere else he said  the thing for
you to do is to float a loan do you believe
in this machine

   sure i do

   every fool inventor believes in his ma-
chine but so does every good inventor
have you ever seen the boys with their
wave machines in california-hundreds of
em selling stock to harness the waters and
they all believe that they have the secret
but gosh i wouldnt believe in a man
who wasnt strong for his own ideas even if
they were bad ones any more than i would
believe in a man who wasnt strong for his
own kids even if they looked like the
devil

   of course said springtime  i might
go down the main stem and batter for a few
light pieces

   yes you could mccabe would be on
your neck in no time and if he missed you

i wouldnt the thing for you to do is to


argosy-allstory weekly

 look at this thing as a business proposition
 im ready to consider this-i have never
 refused to listen to a man who had some-
 thing to sell in which he did believe and
 you might draw a lesson from thaf ill
 see you at the bank at -he took a red-
 covered book from his pocket and consulted
 it- at twenty minutes to ten he said
  i can give you ten minutes then

  springtime did not dare to laugh al-
though there was something comic in the
seriousness of the old man why couldnt
he hand over a five or so and let it go at
that but osborne was full of queer tricks
-he was as fond of playing games as any
boy and probably this wtas another of his
games he might get to the bank and find
that the old man wasnt there or some other
equally crude practical joke all the same
if the old man was serious there was a thrill
in the thought that he believed his inven-
tion good enough to bother with it

  another improvement occurred to him as
he waited for twenty minutes to ten to roll
around it would be much better to have
the beans flow past him in a narrow rapid
stream than in a broad slow stream it
would be ideal to get them into single file
where he could knock off the offenders with
a stick as a machine gun would knock over
a file of soldiers the product would be
purer he narrowed the opening in his
hopper and put in twro slanting pieces of
wood so that the contents of the box would
slide down to the orifice

   this took him so long that when he swung
in under the severe doric entrance of the
napoleon national bank he saw by the
big clock on the sidewalk that he was five
minutes late that did not worry him for
the reason that he was not a business man
and had not much sympathy with business
methods besides it was all more or less of
a joke anyway-this bringing him to a
bank to borrow a five or so

  inside the door he looked about him
and immediately felt somewhat chastened
the lobby was a big open space done in
cream-colored stone and lighted from above
by an amber skylight the customers
moved quietly and solidly behind their
wickets the clerks were equally quiet and
gave a feeling of tremendous efficiency and

the clink of coin and the whisper of pajjer
gave a hint of power which suddenly made
springtime feel small embarrassed and out
of place instinctively he reached to take
off his hat and then seeing that other men
had theirs on he let his stay where it was

   at his right and left were small open
spaces separated from the rest of the bank
by low ornamental railings within these
spaces were open-topped mahogany desks
and behind one he say the globular figure of
osborne springtime swung up to the rail-
ing and said in spite of the crushing effect
of the bank interior  well here i am
boss

   the old man did not look up from the
intent perusal of a stamped paper which
springtime guessed was a mortgage his
gold-rimmed spectacles were far down on his
nose and his shrewd eyes were almost shut
in the concentration which he poured upon
a canceled paper which was not worth a
split seconds attention that heavy piece
of paper was camouflage osborne was in-
tent upon driving home a lesson upon his
outlaw employee and it was not until
springtime had stood there for a full three
minutes in which the quietness of the bank
began to tell heavily upon his hobo impu-
dence that he loked up and peered at the
clock under the mural decoration showing
the arts of peace overcoming the arts of
war

    youre late he said gravely  i can
give you only six minutes you will have to
work fast come in

he leaned forward and slipped the catch
on the bronze gateway so that his client
could enter the inventor took his place in
a deep chair that faced osbome he sat
with one leg cocked up and his cap dangling
from his knees it was an attitude that
looked comfortable but the young man was
feeling far from that

 you want to float a loan said osbome
in the same grave tone  can you give me
more particulars

 ah you know what i want said
springtime  if i can get hold of a few
bones so that i can hire somebody to turn
the crank i get them done just that much
faster if i cant i do em by hand and
they never get done thats all if you
the bird of passage



want to stake me fork over a couple of ber-
ries and ill have them done in a week

  osbome looked at him so intently so
coolly that springtimes grin became rather
vacuous

   have you any security to offer

   no except that when i get five
bushels done the next one will be mine
that was the arrangement

   when you get four bushels done cor-
rected osborne  i said  would give you
one bushel out of every fire however i
hardly think that could be called security
for i have a first lien on at least part of
that for your board bill you have been
working so slowly that you have gone be-
hind you are right in trying to float a
loan but a man who wants to borrow money
must offer some security so that in case he
fails to make good the innocent lender will
not be the sufferer have you anything
else

   nothing but my clothes i guess its
settled ill be drifting back to work

   just a minute lots of men borrow
money without any more security than you
have to offer there would be very little
business done if people on both sides didnt
take a chance once in a while and when
you come right down to it industry and
honesty are assets just as much as houses
and land-more so thats why england
is top dog in finance and russia isnt
there are a half dozen men in this com-
munity who are running their automobiles-
own em too-to whom i wouldnt lend a
cent and there are a half dozen men here
who have nothing but health industry and
honesty to whom i have loaned anything
from five to five thousand dollars you un-
derstand that such loans of course are not
made by savings banks institutions like
this one must have assets that can be easily
liquidated im always willing personally
to gamble on a man with push and hon-
esty-largely from the standpoint of its
being a public service thats the kind of
man that builds up a town hes a greater
asset without one cent than a loafer is with
a million he didnt earn

  springtime who had been following with
keen interest shook his head  that lets
me out im not industrious-

    and maybe not honest said osbome
smoothly

    as long as i work by hand ill be in
debt to you returned springtime  and
not only in debt but getting deeper and
deeper all the time ive seen some grading
camps where it worked the same way-you
didnt get enough money no matter how
hard you worked to pay off your board bill
at the end of the week there was only one
way to handle that situation and that was
to take a chance and shift and then you
had a good prospect of getting in jail im
not fast enough to keep up with my board
bill and unless i speed up production i get
nothing out of it and neither will you in the
end

  a delighted grin flashed for a moment on
osbornes face

   listen to the boy he said with a re-
turn to what might be called his stable
manner  talking about speeding up pro i
duction now ill tell you something else
about business once in a while-once in a
great while it pays to throw good money
after bad-but mind im not saying that
this is one of those times you know the
old wheeze about how the indian found his
lost arrow-he shot another in the same di-
rection and watched it fall once in a
while he probably lost both-generally he
found both but we arent indians ill
waive any claim to the first sack of beans-
but if i advance any money it will be just
enough to get you past that first sack
thats yours to do as you darn please with
and ill confess im a bit curious to know
just what you would do with it just how
much would it take to get you past that first
sack

  springtime did a bit of rapid calculating
based on what he considered would be his
producing power once he had his machine
going in proper form

   ten hours he said  i have one
bushel done already and im sure i could
ck four more with that machine in ten
hours counting out time for repairs im-
provements and adjustments i don t know
what wages i would have to pay

   fifteen cents an hour said osborne
with a smoothness which should have
warned springtime  thats enough for


argosy-allstory weekly

anybody that would make a dollar and a
half for ten hours-just one dollar and a
half more than im willing to risk on you
as a panhandler you may be a great man
but as a business risk youre a scream the
only thing for you to do is to get back there
and get to work youve spent more time
now over a bushel than a one-armed blind
man would spend over ten good day 

  he arose and swung open the little gate
and springtime speechless with rage
crowded up to him with his fists balled
osborne put a hand on his arm and said
 easy now you arent talking to some old
binclle stiff who couldnt put up a fight
springtime stepped slowly out eye to eye
with his tormentor  why i dont slam
you he grated  is beyond me

   ah said osborne putting up a thick
forefinger  theres a reason this ones
named mccabe then with a chuckle he
turned back to his desk and springtime
walked to the street

  even while he had been in the bank there
had been a change in the weather the
wind had shifted to the northwest and there
was a scurry of gray clouds over the roof-



tops that wind was biting people bowed
their heads to it but springtime sniffed it
hungrily for it brought to him the same
summons that it brought to the wild geese-
the mysterious call to be moving there
would be fain ice on the ponds to-morrow
morning-that wind freshened bis longing
until it burned like a spruce bough and in
that flame he forgot all about the scene
that had just passed in the bank

  he began to walk rapidly and heedlessly
but he was bound more strongly than he
knew there was mccabe and there was
kitty the former kept him away from the
railroad tracks and the latter drew him back
toward his pen within five minutes that
flame subsided into a sullen glow and he was
standing outside his shed miserable home-
sick for he knew not what almost without
the courage to pull himself into that shed
and take up his dull task of sorting beans by
hand he pushed open the door slowly and
stepped across the threshold and saw kitty
standing by his machine and turning the
handle slowly she looked up as he entered
and the light of pure adoration flamed up in
her eyes

to be concluded next week

horatius algernon mcfall
the undisputed champion cook of
all the big timber camps lying
north of the oregon state line and west of
the cascade mountains listened to the ap-
peal of two old friends with grave sad face
and an eye moistened by sympathy ho-
ratius was as big in person as he was famed
in the culinary art and the heart in his
bosom was proportioned to his great girth
and height-a mighty heart as tender as
his own pie crusts the words of bruce
ray and yvally newell touched that heart
to its core

   we come to you horatius ray
explained gravely  because you know
women you understand the sex youve
already been married aint you old-
timer

   five times mcfall acknowledged
with a deep sigh  my last two died on
me

  there you are ray turned to his
     a

friend newell with triumph in his gaze

 didnt i tell you wally five times
if he aint able to advise us who can

   well horatius had ought to know for
a fact newell admitted

   gents said horatius in his clear mild
voice so oddly at variance with his height
and girth  do i understand that your
troubles revolves about and centers in so
to speak one of the fair sex in other
words did vou come to consult me about a
lady

 we did newell admitted glumly

   a little red-haired lady his partner
supplemented with a hopeful look

  horatius shook his head sagely pursing
his lips ere he delivered judgment  no
it cant be done the man that under-
stands em aint yet been bom i say it
thats led five to the altar

 hes right newell agreed quickly

embroidered with innumerable stenciled

  wallv sighed heavily

   how any sane woman could pass up a
he-man like wally for one of these here
washed-out baldheaded knock-kneed shoe
drummers from seattle is what gets me 
wallys friend growled  the boss boom
tender of puget sound and i told her so
too

   then gents i take it theres competi-
tion in this here tournament for a ladys
favor horatius inquired

   there is thats why we come to you
horatius my godfrey wally and me has
done everythin two men could do to win
that woman-

   but good gosh bruce-you dont both
aim to win her you cant not in this
country

   both hell no its wally wants to
marry her im tellin you naturally
though im doin what i can aint i
wally and me being tilikums all this time
and we worked every dodge we know ho-
ratius we took it in shifts when wally
come off the job i begun settin out on
the porch with her takin her for walks
tellin her about wally and what a husband
hed make for some lucky girl why i
even dance with her

   then when im played out wally goes
back on watch again and shows the lady
all his good points look at his clothes
wouldnt you think his clothes alone would
soften her heart and his dancin-we
spent fifty dollars with sid wilcox honest
johns son-in-law that teaches dancin in
the city to get him learned all the fancy
new steps and yet she shows she thinks
more of this here addison foster-this shoe
drummer thats got a wall eye and dyspep-
sia

   but bruce what can i do about it
horatius puzzled

   we thought if youd come look over the
lady- wally suggested hopefully

  bruce took the words out of his mouth
 yes horatius if youd just come over to
honest johns and give her kind of an ex-
perts survey like you havin had five
of em had ought to know a lot about
women maybe you could tell if you saw

her and talked with her just whats wrong
with us maybe you could map out some
way we could work sos her eyes would
be opened to her mistake and shed see
wally in his real lights

   youd be kind of like that ee-ficiency
engineer old man morris used to have to
show him how to run his camp better
wally interposed

   it wouldnt take long horatius and
whilst you was at honest johns me and
wallyd pay all expenses

   our skiff is down on the beach now
wally explained

   and its only an hours row-

   all expenses horatius maybe youd
enjoy a hotel for a day or so-

   for the sake of old times horatius
its a small thing to ask-

   and you understand women what
say

  horatius said  gents i cant refuse
i aint got the heart well have a
look at this here widow lady

iii

  every summer resort has its seasona
belle even honest john burkes very
modest hotel at skookum inlet was no ex-
ception to this rule its guests included
ten women several of them unmarried the
married women were joined over the week
ends by their husbands who came from the
city and the unmarried ones by fathers and
brothers and sweethearts-all except mrs
kitten mccoy who had no husband or
father to join her and who recruited her
sweethearts on the spot

   during the week because of the arrange-
ment there were but three men available as
cavaliers they were wally newell bruce
ray and addison foster the shoe salesman
kitten mccoy appropriated all three which
made her about as popular as rat poison
with the other women nevertheless she
did it for in that field she showed more
class more charm more of that come-
hither that grips the fancy of the unat-
tached man than any of her competitors

  mrs mccoy was a little woman and if
you believed the whisperers on honest
johns porch she had kissed good-by to her


argosy-allstory weekly

   thirty-fifth birthday some time ago but
 she didnt show signs of it she was little
 and slight yet plump enough too her
 hair was a golden red and curled profusely
 even in damp weather her eyes were
 brown and merry and she had dimples

   when the subject of his investigations
 and consideration was pointed out to ho-
 ratius algernon mcfall the ex-cook looked
 queer he studied her with covert glances
 through the evening meal and when later
 he saw her in a dancing frock cut low and
 short in the sleeves and skirt and generally
 summerish and cool he looked more startled
 than ever

   the day of mcfalps advent chanced to
 be saturday and the guests held an infor-
 mal dance in the hotel parlor on saturday
 nights with a phonograph as an orchestra
 mcfall was presented to the widow by
 bruce ray and bruce left them after
 nudging his big friend significantly

    i been thinking maam said mcfall
  that you and me must have met some-
 wheres before

    oh mr mcfall how romantic the
 brown-eyed widow cuddled closer to hora-
 tius and rolled her glance upward in a
 manner calculated to do most damage
  but i cant remember you she added
  i meet so many people

   mcfall frowned in an effort to recollect
  it come over me strong when i saw you
 come out in that dress he murmured
  i got a feeling it must be so somehow i
 associate you with australia-

    were you ever in australia

   no maam i never was and yet-

    neither was i but perhaps its an af-
 finity perhaps our psychic auras harmon-
 ize  oh mr mcfall

   addison foster wally newells rival
 claimed the lady at this moment and mc-
 fall watched her follow him to the dance
 floor clinging to his arm and cuddling ap-
 pealingly just as she had clung to his own
 arm a moment before

   funny-mighty funny he murmured
 strangely stirred  seems like i could re-
 member her to a t under a lot of lights
 like that something to do with australia
 funny

   during the evening horatius kept his eye

 on the widow and frowned and wrinkled
 up his smooth guileless countenance as he
 tried to remember their former meeting
  i seen her somewheres he repeated of-
 ten  somewheres all dressed up just like
 that with bright lights and music playing
 ill take my oath to that

   what say bruce ray asked bruce
had spent most of the evening near hora-
tius his blue eyes on his friend and in them
the trustful confiding look that the suffer-
ing patient accords to the great specialist
handling his case  did you dope out a
scheme yet bruce whispered hoarsely

    not yet bruce but i will say that
wally picked out a elegant lady for his
wooing

    aint she bruce glowed with honest
pride in his friends choice  look at her
dance look how she carries herself im
tellin you thats the kind of woman that
deserves wally newell and high time
wally wras settlin down too as i was-
heywhat the hell

   bruce ray started from the wall where
he had been leaning and shoved his way
among the dancers his huge fists doubling
and his tow mustache bristling

   the music had stopped and couples were
forming for another fox trot wally had
presented himself to kitten mccoy and
simultaneously wally s rival addison fos-
ter had come to claim the dance

   bruce the argus-eyed chaperon saw all
this and acted with a suddenness more
reminiscent of the logging camp than the
ballroom his big hand clamped onto ad-
dison fosters shoulder and spun him
around he growled ominously  this
here is mr newells turn to dance with that
lady if you get what i mean

   you promised me maam wally was
protesting

   addison foster helpless in the giants
grip coughed out something about being
only a gentleman he could scarcely be ex-
pected to compete with loggers and their
barroom methods

  the red-haired widow gave a little
scream a pretty little scream that proved
she was more pleased and frightened she
cuddled up to bruce ray and gently de-
tached his hand from fosters shoulder
showing the widow



   you great big rude man she declared

 you mustnt play rough or youll fright-
en poor little me most half to death

   my gosh mis mccoy i sure am sorry
if i-

   now kitten mccoy clapped her
hands and beamed brightly on the contend-
ers  i have it just for the way you
boys act im going to dance with this big
bear and punish you both

  horatius algernon mcfall observed all
this closely he studied over the signifi-
cance of the scene during the dance and
afterward summoned bruce and wally from
the hotel parlor by a significant beck of his
head

   gents he whispered when they were
on the porch  suppose we go some place
where we aint likely to be intruded upon
i think i got an idea thats going to iron
the wrinkles out of the course of true love

iv

  the three conspirators went down to the
beach below the hotel where seated on logs
they wtent into solemn conclave mcfall
the expert on matrimony and women de-
livered his opinion

   the fair and frailer sex said the ex-
cook gravely  falls into two general clas-
sifications according to my way of thinking
-ladies and wromen first theres the la-
dies god bless em-ladies with tender
hearts and natural feelings of modesty la-
dies that needs a mans strong arm to pro-
tect em and regards such protectors with
an affection and reverence for their strength
that makes a mans married life like it was
heaven on the other hand theres just
the women-women that wants the earth
served up to em with a garnish of parsley
on a silver platter women that looks on a
man as a good thing and an easy mark and
a meal ticket and nothing more gents
ive had both kinds and i know now this
mis mccoy-

   shes a lady wally declared

   of course shes a lady bruce chimed

 in

   great grief i dont say she aint
horatius hastened to agree  thats the
point shes a true lady shes one of these

little tender-hearted clinging type of wo-
men shes the kind of lady looks up to a
man as her natural protector and loves to
regard him as such trouble is you aint
recognized that fact properly-

   look here mcfall-

   what dyou mean you mean i aint
treated that lady like she was a lady
wally began to seethe

    i mean you aint taking advantage of
it i mean you aint using the right tac-
tics the cook cried hastily  love is a
game gents the poet says  alls fair in
love and war the object of it is to win the
lady aint it well you dont play this
campaign right thats whats the matter
now take the case of this mis mccoy
shes a lady with a tender heart and a
shrinking clinging nature like the vine that
twines its tendrils round the sturdy oak
like the poet says aint that so-

    horatius is right by godfrey thats
a true word wally

   of course im right now what a wo-
man like that looks up to is strength in a
man she wants a hero shell worship a
hero trouble with wally is he dont show
that he is a hero

    suffering sockeyes horatius howm i
going to show her im a hero

  thats just it horatius exclaimed
 thats the point youre small in stature
wally it aint your fault of course you
was made that way i know and bruce
knows that when you get into action they
aint anything living that moves faster or
can put up a livelier fight we both seen
you work but you aint trying to marry
me or bruce youre trying to marry this
mis mccoy and she dont know

  bruce burst out aggrievedly well
shed ought to know what do you suppose
i been talkin to her about all this time
talkin until i cant raise my voice above
a whisper im so clean wore out with it
aint i told her aint i told her how wally
cleaned up that gang that come over from
the troy traps lookin for a fight with
old man morriss outfit aint i told her
how wally single-handed licked a whole
scow load of roughnecks that blacky mc-
donald was tryin to steal for todds camp
aint i told her how wally beat up the


argosy-allstory weekly

terrible swede that night in billy the mugs
bar-

    aw what dyou want to go tell her them
things for wally protested  shell think
im a regular drunken shingle-weaver 

    what dyou want to tell her anything
for mcfall cried

    what dyou mean not tell her you
said-

    i say show her show her that wallys
the equal of twice his weight in bobcats
show her wallys a gent and a real hero
show her hes got a heart that beats for
woman in distress a wallop that d floor a
pile-driver and a disposition thats so ten-
der a little child can handle him and not
get scratched show her dont tell her

    horatius mcfall you talk like a old
he-fool how in the name of the pearly
gates of hell are we goin to show the lady
that

    yes how wally chimed in

    simple mcfall exclaimed triumphant-
ly  its simple if you boys  learn to use
your brains now you listen to me and
ill tell you a story i seen one time in a
movie showr

    story whats that got to do with it
dont start kiddin us horatius

    it was like this the cook went on
placidly  they was a lady like mis
mccoy a big brute like bruce here was
in love with her and kidnaped her into a
cave in the woods and then the hero-
he was a kind of slender handsome sort of
party that didnt look like he deist insult a
tomcat-he found the lady in the nitch of
time and the way he lit into the big fellow
was something scandalous after hed beat
up that brute so his own mother wouldnt
recognize him again the lady seen shed
made a mistake despising him and that he
had the right stuff in him after all and
she wrapped her arms around his neck and
the picture ended with happiness to all
and gents the same look was in that ladys
eye that wras in the eye of mis mccoy
when that little ruction started on the dance
floor in there kind of scared yet pleased
kind of a proud look for the hero that res-
cued her if you understand wthat im driv-
ing at so thats how i got the idea and
if you take my advice thats the plan youll

follow remember ive led five to the
alfar-

    plan what plan wally wanted to
 know

   if thats sr plan im a chinaman
 bruce ray declared

     aint i doing my best to tell you the
 plan lay off and let me talk or maybe
 youd rather bungle along and let this addi-
 son foster win the ladys heart and hand

   wally and bruce hurriedly assured ho-
 ratius that he had the floor they paid
 him the compliment of close attention while
 he detailed his notion of translating the in-
 cident of the movie show into real life and
 genuine thrills and in time horatius al-
 gernon mcfall who had married and
 mourned for five of his own had them con-
 vinced that he understood women

                     v

    as the details developed and rehearsals
 ironed out the rough spots horatius alger-
 non mcfall was inclined to look on the little
 drama in real life which he had cooked up
 and was stage managing as one of his culi-
 nary triumphs the plot was simple

   wally of course must be the hero it
 was wally who wtas to wrest the widow from
 the hands of the brute who had abducted
 her to his woodland lair

   the role of the brute was assigned to
 bruce ray after a great deal of argument

    u hell boys i cant do it i just couldnt
 touch a finger to that lady i wouldnt
 dast bruce objected

    but bruce somebodys got to do it
 its all pretending anyhow-

    aw no dont ask me im a-scairt
 to do it wally

    nothing to be scairt of horatius
 argued  just grab her up and run off with
 her to the old cabin thats all me id do
 it myself but im too fat nobodyd ever
 take me for a wild man-not even a lady
 bruce i thought youd do anything to help
 out wally

    my godfrey so i would but-
 but-

on the grounds of friendship they won
him over he consented to be the wild man
of the woods for that reason he left honest
showing the widow



johns hotel and retired to the abandoned
logging camp to let his whiskers grow and
be perfected in the arts of thespis

  after two weeks horatius was satisfied
they could give a finished performance
bruce had grown sufficient whiskers to pass
as a wild and villainous caveman wally was
desperate enough to undertake the regctie
with proper spirit and besides the widow
was showing a preference for the company
of addison foster the shoe salesman

  the plot was simple wally was to take
kitten mccoy for a walk in the woods
and make an excuse to leave her alone
bruce would kidnap her and carry her to a
ruinous log cabin there the dashing wally
would trail her engage in a thrilling rough-
and-tumble battle in which he would com-
pletely vanquish the wild man after that
horatius was willing to trust to nature and
feminine psychology

   but remember gents he said earnest-
ly  that fight has got to look like it was the
real thing get mad dont forget go
at it like it was life or death but bruce
for the sake of pete dont you go forget and
not let wally floor you

   aw shucks horatius it dont seem
right fighting thataway in front of a lady
you fight horatius said firmly
 you fight if you aim to help out your old
pal and another thing dont you dast
say a word when you carry off the lady
silence will scare her most besides if you
was to speak youd go apologizing to her
horatius was well satisfied he had come
to like the role of expert in feminine psy-
chology and the doglike gratitude of two
such famous old-timers as bruce and wally
was ample reward for his trouble only
one thing troubled him

   i do wish to tophet i could remember
where i seen that widow before he mused
 i did see her sure as sunrise with that
kind of a fancy dress and bare arms-and
a lot of bright lights shining australia
funny i keep thinking of australia

vi

  the abduction worked perfectly hora-
tius watching from the shelter of the under-
growth was delighted

  bruce ray who would lay down his life
any time for his friend was in a state of
mind that made him terrible indeed lay-
ing down his life was as nothing compared
to what wally asked of him now an
inbred terror of women in general aggra-
vated by a severe attack of stage fright
had driven him into a sort of desperation
that made him truly wild no actor could
have looked half so dangerous

   when this tattered terrifying apparition
burst from the woods and snatched her into
his arms the widow mccoy gave one gasp
and then lay still while bruce trotted off
with her

   likely fainted horatius thought
 thats all the better now wally-
he turned to newell crouching beside him
wally had laid aside his new blue coat
neatly folded he had loosed the collar
from his shirt tom the shirt open in the
accepted manner of heroes who always ex-
pose manly bosoms rumpled up his hair and
already assumed a look of righteous indigna-
tion winch was not altogether pretense the
sight of kitten mccoy in bruces arms
was a bit startling to wrally

  after em boy the cook whispered
tensely  but not too fast wally easy
give bruce time to reach the cabin

   wtally was off like a shot horatius fol-
lowing in his wake the cook was not built
for running and the underbrush was thick
after he had wallowed through a blackberry
thicket and just saved himself from a bad
fall by grasping at a stalk of prickly devils
club he took it at a walk puffing sweat-
ing and still busy picking briers out of vari-
ous parts of his anatomy he finally neared
the ruinous cabin and heard sounds of a
commotion worthy of the best melodrama

   feet were thudding on the old plank floor
and groans and grunts and the occasional
smack of a fist punctuated the thudding
wally and bruce wrere fighting hammer and
tongs

  the cook circled the front of the build-
ing and stole up from the rear half the
roof of the place had fallen in and the w-alls
gaped it was no trouble to find a peep-
hole

   the fighters circled dizzily feinting rush-
ing dodging most of wallys shirt had

been torn off there was a trickle of real
blood smeared across the pseudo wild mans
face his blue eyes gleamed terribly from
under the thatch of blond hair

  the widow mccoy stood flattened
against the log wall half crouching all her
attention concentrated on the two combat-
ants

   her brown eyes were gleaming wide with
a fierce sort of exultation her red lips
parted in what might have been a grimace
of terror but looked more like a smile of
delight she clasped her hands and from
time to time gasped words of encourage-
ment unintelligible to the cook

   the drumming boots of the fighters raised
 a terrific cloud of dust from the rotting
 boards the very frame of the old cabin
 rocked and rattled with the battle

   get him wally land on him ho-
ratius prompted through his chink in the
wall  soak him old kid atta boy
bruce bruce lay dowm lay down
you fat head senough i tell you
o-o-o-oh

  wally had rushed the big man their
arms locked about each others waists

   the hero looked like a child of ten in
bruce rays grip

   they teetered and shuffled wrestling sav-
 agely

   then wally ripped himself free and his
right fist flashed smack bruce tottered
smack came the heros left the huge
logger dropped with a crash like the fall of
a giant redwood the solid earth quivered
with shock

   then a moment of stupefying silence

   wally the hero rocked a little dizzily
as he leaned over the prostrate caveman
fists ready to inflict further punishment if
the brute as much as dared stir

   but bruce was satisfied he held laid
his wreath on friendships altar he had
nothing more to contribute

   wally turned on the widow  fear noth-
ing dear lady he panted stumbling over
the speech horatius had taught him  this
big stiff wont-er-wont-that is-

   the diminutive hero never remembered
the rest of what he had to say it was
some time before he remembered anything
clearly

   kitten mccoy bounded from her comer

    she said nothing at all but the smile on
 her face was grim and terrible and as she
 came her right fist lashed out like a tongue
 of avenging flame the blow spun wally
 newell like a top

   before he ceased spinning the widow
 caught him again

   wally emitted one yell one wild mad
 yell compounded of equal parts of pain
 surprise and indignation vainly he tried
 to cover himself from her blows she drove
 him round and round the little cabin and
 fast as he wrent her blows landed faster

   a crouching grinning terror was the
 widow mccoy a terror with two fists of
 granite and the skill and muscle to drive
 them accurately and fast as bullets she
 moved with a lithe bounding grace that was
 feline and every move urged the hapless
 wally to greater terror

    bruce ray sitting up witnessed the as-
 tounding exhibition with his jaw hanging
 open wally was getting the worst of it
 when that fact finally registered the big
 man leaped to his feet and shoved himself
 between the pursuer and pursued bellow-
 ing  lay offen him maam for petes
 sake lay off-

    the widow seemed scarcely to notice his
 presence she leaped around him to land
 another blow

     hey  bruce roared in protest  hey
 you 

    this time he caught her arm in his huge
 hand and stopped her

   the arm was snatched from his grasp
  keep out of this snapped the widow
 mccoy and before the big man could raise
 a finger her fist connected neatly with the
 point of his chin bruce ray toppled and
 fell again and this time his fall was less ar-
 tistic but much more convincing he had
 been knocked out in dead earnest

   a moment more the battling widow toyed
 with her prey then wally newell fol-
 lowed his friend to the floor

   kitten mccoy turned then on the fallen
giant she flung herself to the floor beside
bruce and with her little lace handkerchief
began to wipe the blood from his face

 bruce she sobbed  bruce deary
open your eyes say you forgive me
showing the widow



bruce i didnt mean to hurt my big boy

i didnt mean to deary speak to me-oh
speak to me-

vii

  wally newell bad crawled from the
cabin and horatius assisted him to a near-
by stream where he bathed himself and
gradually recovered some recollection of
events with the cooks recital to fill the
gaps the state of affairs dawned on wally

  oh my gosh horatius she never
wanted tc be rescued that must have
been it-and yet it dont seem possible it
dont seem as if it could be-horatius
sneak back and see what theyre doing
now

  horatius did and reported

   i guess youre right wally she didnt
want to be took away from bruce shes
a-tying up his scratches and calling him her
little lambseytivey looks to me like
shed made up her mind to marry bruce-
 but horatius supposing bruce dont
want to marry her

 wally said the cook with dread sig-
nificance  i guess if shes made up her

mind thats settled would you go for to
refuse a lady with a wallop like that

  wally groaned and shuddered

   and whats more horatius said  i
remember at last where i seen her before
it came to me while she was chasing you
round the cabin must have been fifteen
years ago but ill never forget it they
was a circus to whatcom one fourth of
july wally and it had a genuine australian
boxing kangaroo used to put gloves on
all fours of that kangaroos feet and invite
all comers to scrap him when he got mad
hed raise up on his tail and land a punch
with his hind foot that knocked out the best
rough-and-tumble fighters on puget sound
then a lady come out in the ring and put
on the gloves with that kangaroo and
wally that lady walloped the tar out of
him

    i remember it all now like it was yes-
 terday the bright lights and the ladys
 spangly dress and her curly red hair its
 her all right wally her back there in the
 cabin making up her mind to marry bruce
 thats the lady in the circus that used to
 lick the kangaroo

the modern proposal

         yjtiiy worry over rumpled lace

               when youve a lover to embrace

         yet-is the rouge upon your face

                              a blunder

         will he disturb your hairs smooth gold-

the fairy tale

the big davenport in front of the fire-
place accommodated the whole quar-
tet in a row sutliffe diantha myra
and dimmock before leaving kittson had
replenished the fire with cannel coal and
all four pairs of eyes were held fascinated
by the leaping yellow flames to have seen
them sitting there so quietly relaxed who
could have suspected the feelings and pas-
sions stirring within lust a cold hate and a
generous indignation sutliffe glanced side-
wise at dianthas lovely neck and his limbs
twitched myra while she plotted the girls
betrayal caught up her hand and affection-
ately patted it diantha suspecting what
was passing in her thoughts could scarcely
tolerate her touch only dimmock had
nothing in particular on his mind he sup-
plied most of the chatter

  this is great an open fire lets you
 down so comfy life in this town keeps
 you keyed up to concert pitch you have
 to watch out or you bust your g string

  youre keyed up too sharp dimmock
 drawled myra you squeak

  lovely lady i am no stradivari us but
 only a montgomery ward but if you will
 deign to play on me-

  oh shut up what makes you so quiet
 diantha

  nothing its nice here

  better than that foolish play

  rather kirwan is the quiet one

  what ho sut cried dimmock

  avast there answered sutliffe

  he looks pale opined dimmock

  must have been the curry with chopped
 almonds and raisins that was masterly
 myra must get the recipe from you
 once when i lunched with the bleecker  an
 brocklins they had a curry-

this story began in the argosy-allstory weekly for september 


a new girl in town



   dimmocks great preoccupation was food
 and he was well launched now the other
 three let him run on while the thought
 their own thoughts the proper way to
 cook a canvas back submerge him in boil-
 ing fat for twenty minutes to seal up his
 delectable juices the various merits of be-
 chamel hollandaise and beamaise et cetera
 et cetera

   once when diantha leaned forward to
poke the fire myra sent sutliffe an admon-
ishing glance behind her back he was giv-
ing too much away in his looks at diantha
he was not playing up to the sprightly part
myra had laid down for him

   sutliffe roused himself with an effort and
 started to chaff dimmock dimmock came
 back the verbal shuttlecock was batted
 back and forth it was not very writty but
 diantha laughed good naturedly nothing
 could have seemed more innocent and harm-
 less

   when a lull came myra said lazily  kir-
 wan havent you a lot of cups that you won
 in track meets at college

    on the sideboard in the dining room
 said sutliffe

    i want to see them come on dim-
mock

   the two strolled into the next room sut-
 liffes eyes were fixed on them a long
 breath escaped him he leaned toward
 diantha

  thank god he murmured i
couldnt have stood it much longer what
a torment to sit here beside you with others
present to have to make small talk

   the passion in his voice scorched dian-
 tha she shrank away from him  kir-
 wan please she murmured  theyll be
 back in a moment

   he put a strong curb on himself and took
 her hand quietly

    i worship you he murmured  you
do care a little dont you

    i-i think so stammered diantha
 listen

   from the next room came myras lazy
drawl praising the cups then the sound
ceased diantha after waiting a moment
called

    myra 

    from the next room  yes dear

   arent you coming back

   theres another adorable settee in here
were trying it out

  sutliffes arm was creeping around di-
anthas waist and his lips were at her ear

   you see darling they want to give us
a teeny little chance to be together
diantha shied away from him sutliffe
bit his lip in chagrin indeed diantha
seemed to be of two minds whether to stay
or join myra he exerted his powers of
cajolery

   forgive me di suppose i startled
you it was rotten of me when youre here
in my place you are more than ever
sacred to me here ive got a grip on my-
self now you neednt be afraid

  how astonished would he have been
could he have read the apparently shrinking
girls thoughts

   if myra is going to sneak out i wish
shed be done with it so i could get the
letters and make my own get-away i sup-
pose he has a pistol somewhere but it
cant be on him i can get mine out first
how can i keep him covered and at the
same time get the safe open well if the
worst comes to the worst ill have to open
the window

  you are so wonderful he wyent on
 and so terribly sweet your hair is like a
bronze mist-how lovely it must be when
its down your neck is like cream 

   dont praise me kir wan she mur-
mured in seeming confusion she had a
difficult part to play

  a light laugh came to them from the next
room

   whats the joke diantha called out
  sutliffe turned away impatiently

  myras answer came  not worth repeat-
ing dear dimmocks got as far as the
roast in his bill of fare he says geese
should be stuffed with chestnuts i told
him he was and now hes sore

  they laughed

   its because i am kept from you that
i get so savage sutliffe murmured  if
we were together you would find me very
different you are so many kinds of wo-
men i could love you hundreds of ways 

   kirvvan why cant we be quietly happy
here by the fire


argosy-allstory weekly

   we can-if you will come close to me

  she moved over a little

   what do you see in the fire sweet-
heart he asked

  nothing she said  what do you
see

   look  he said  that big black lump
at one side thats a church the portico of
a church that crack in it is the door not
quite closed and those little darting flames
that come out thats happiness the
church is so plumb full of happiness its
bursting out of the door if you listen you
can hear the most heavenly music coming
out of that church and outside you see
there are crowds of little dancing flames
those are the happy people waiting to wish
them luck

   wish who luck whispered diantha

   why the boy and girl who are getting
married in the church of course youll
see them in a minute that smaller lump
across from the church door thats a big
limousine waiting to transport them to the
realms of bliss their honeymoon car now
the flames are burning brighter the church
door bursts open here they come arm in
arm with their dreamy eyes fixed on each
other hes a big fellow you see with a wild
nature but she can tame him with the light-
est touch of her little hand he adores
her-

  in the next room myra and dimmock
were frankly at a loss for conversation

  have we got to sit here all night
dimmock asked yawning

  myra shook her head

   can i get a drink from the sideboard

   no the slightest sound now would spoil
everything

  her head was inclined to listen at first
she could hear the murmur of sutliffes
voice but as his tale became more intimate
it dropped stillness filled both rooms
myra rose and glided to the opening con-
cealed behind the door frame she strained
her ears to hear sutliffe was fully launched
on his fairy story a smile of gratified
malice broke over myras face everything
going fine

  returning she beckoned to dimmock
and the two of them walking on tiptoe
passed out into the hall of the apartment

their wraps were lying on an oaken chest
out there myra signed to dimmock to
gather them up she opened the door with
infinite caution and peremptorily indicated
the way out to him his foolish face was
drawn up in protest but he obeyed

   myra following closed the door so care-
fully that only the final click of the latch
was heard this was the prearranged signal
back to sutliffe even if diantha heard
it they figured she would think nothing of
the closing of a door she would not know
but that sutliffes servant was still in the
flat

  outside myra laughed softly and rang
for the elevator

  dimmock pursed his lips out  i say
myra this is a rotten deal-

    be quiet she said she languidly put
up her arms to receive her cloak

  dimmock put it about her and wriggled
into his overcoat

   good god what a devil you are he
muttered

   myra was flattered

  when sutliffe heard the door click a
warm feeling of satisfaction stole through
him the business was about clinched now
he kept on with his story he took an add-
ed zest in it throwing a melting tenderness
into his voice he meant to have diantha
anyway but of course he preferred to charm
her into yielding if he could

       and so the big boy and the
little girl were happy ever afterward

  diantha had heard the click of a door
but could not be sure that it signified mvtas
departure inside she felt as taut as steel
nevertheless her cheek was couched in the
hollow of sutliffes shoulder he drew her
closer to him

  diantha snatched at any excuse to gain
time  oh kirwan our fire is dying
dowm 

    thats easy fixed he said with a laugh
leaning forward he tapped the lumps with
the poker they fell apart and the yellow
flames leaped up afresh  plenty more
happiness you see

   but that will only last a moment and
the scuttle is empty

   more in the kitchen he rose he
a new girl in town



had his own reason for wishing to leave
the room  will you stay here until i
come back

  she nodded

   while he was getting the coal he put the
front door on its chain to guard against
eventualities-such as a sudden break for
freedom

  in his absence diantha peeped into the
next room it was empty so much the
better she looked desirously at the ma-
hogany cabinet but heard him coming back
and made haste to resume her former atti-
tude on the davenport

  when he returned to her side she de-
clined to come back within his arm  im
not sure if i care-the right way she mur-
mured

   like all sensualists sutliffe relied on sen-
suality  theres only one way you can be
sure he said leaning toward her with a
confident smile

   no kirwan

   kiss me

   no no

   you must

  diantha thought  the moment has
come  she steeled herself

    no  she cried in quite a different tone
no maidenly indecision in this

   at this sharp reply sutliffes countenance
took an ugly turn  whats the matter
dont you like me

   no

  he laughed hatefully diantha moved
away from him warily he crept toward
her breathing fast his lips parted and set in
a sneer his eyes filmy and irresponsible
purely animal diantha gained her feet and
began to fumble for her pocket she got a
grip on the handle of her pistol before
she could draw it the door bell sounded
thrice

   sutliffe swallowed an oath he had com-
pletely forgotten the expected waiter now
he was afraid diantha would seize the occa-
sion of the mans entrance to escape with
a lightning change of front he began to
laugh

    i was just fooling  he said

   diantha was looking at him blankly she
couldnt imagine what this interruption por-
tended she didnt want to escape-yet

  wait here till i come back said sut-
 liffe

 she nodded

   sutliffe went down the hall telling himself
 that she was only putting up a bluff of

 resistance

   while he was out of the room diantha
 gazed longingly at the safe again but it
 was too risky to try to get it open before
 he returned she must still play her part
 for a little

   she went through the rooms softly call-
 ing  myra myra 

chapter xxiv

the waiter

 as soon as kittson had carried out sut-
 liffes orders he made haste to change
 his clothes threw his slender belong-
 ings into a grip and left the apartment
 he did not expect to return

   he hurried to a cigar store on sixth
 avenue and called up randal guyons
 house randal was not at home after the
 loss of several precious minutes kittson ran
 him down in the athletic club not a dozen
 blocks from where he was telephoning two
 minutes later a taxicab deposited randal
 in front of the cigar store

   kittson left his bag with the tobacconist
 and the two went outside to talk kittson
 dreading the effect on randal told him
 haltingly what had happened

   but randal took it as such blows are
 generally taken quietly he drewt a sharp
 breath his teeth came together with a snap
 his body stiffened

   kittson was becoming frightened by the
 quiet demeanor of the young man

    what are you going to do sir he
 stammered

   let me think muttered randal
  whatever i do-i must do alone

    i am here said kittson

    come on lets walk in that direction
 said randal sharply  ill get in there
 somehow you have a latch key

   kittson produced it  but theres a
 chain on the door sir hes sure to fasten
 that

 you said there was a waiter expected


argosy-allstory weekly

hes to ring three times ill ring three

times

    hes apt to take a look sir before he
takes the chain off

  randal considered  ill have to hide
behind the stair door until the waiter comes
when sutliffe opens the door to him ill rush
it

   but hes a bigger man than you sir
how will you-

  randal laughed a single note  dont
worry about that once i get inside 
handle him

    cant i help you sir

   randal shook his head

    i cant have any public row

  when they were within a few yards of
the apartment house a woman clad in mag-
nificent sables came out followed by an in-
significant male randal and kittson
stopped

  myra follett muttered the former
 you were right they have left her there
oh god if theyve drugged her-

    in that case hed hardly order supper
suggested kittson

  randal pressed his arm gratefully
 youre right but how could she consent
to be left behind

  myra and dimmock entered the waiting
landaulet and drove away randal and
kittson parted randal entered the house
kittson walkedup and down outside

  randal was a frequent visitor in the
apartment house  mr oddie in he
asked carelessly

    yes sir

  when the car let him out at the fourth
floor randal turned in the direction of od-
dies door as soon as the boy had dropped
out of sight he softly retraced his steps to
sutliffes door and listened he could hear
nothing with the greatest care he inserted
the latch key kittson had given him and
turned it the door opened for a couple of
inches but as he expected it was caught on
its chain

   straining his ears randal heard the low
murmur of two voices from the living room
he could not hear the words but there was
nothing to excite alarm his strained breast
relaxed a little

    i am in time he thought

  but it was sufficiently maddening to be
so near her yet prevented from reaching

her side by that chain

  the clang of the elevator door below
forced him hastily to close sutliffes door
and seek a hiding place on the stairs the
stairs were shut off the landing by a swing
door alongside the elevator this door had
a little square pane of glass at eye-level
the elevator ascended to the floor above
discharged passengers and returned once
more randal opened sutliffes door and lis-
tened

  presently the elevator started to rise
again and he was forced to retreat behind
the stair door the car stopped beside
him peering sidewise through the little
pane he saw the waiter get out earn ing his
tray it was a man from clareties who
had often served randal his name was
antoine antoine paused by the elevator
door to chat with the operator that youth
stuck his head out of the car and both of
them looking at sutliffes door nodded and
leered significantly

  it caused the w-atchers breast to bum
that such men should make light of dian-
tha was almost more than he could bear
it suggested a new difficulty how could
he allow the waiter to be a witness to di-
anthas humiliation out of his distress a
new plan of action wtas suddenly bom the
waiter should not see diantha

   the elevator door clanged and the waiter
started across the landing randal pushed
out of his door and laud a hand on the
astonished antoines arm just as it was ex-
tended to press sutliffes bell

  antoine seeing who it was bobbed his
head and smiled mr guyon was a good
customer randal affecting a jocular air
which sat queerly on his drawn white face
laid a finger on his lips for silence and drew
antoine back from sutliffe s door

   im going to play a joke on mr sut-
liffe he said  lend me your hat and
coat and apron

  at first antoine looked dubious appar-
ently he doubted the good taste of the joke
when mr sutliffe was entertaining a lady
but then for all he knew it was still mr
guyons apartment too and anyhow who
was he to question the doings of the young
a new girl in town



 olympians he was assisted in arriving
 at a decision by the appearance of guyons
 pocketbook and the flash of a five-dollar
 bill

   making believe to enter into the spirit
 of the joke with many nods and grins an-
 toine put his tray down on the floor and
 the exchange of clothing was effected an-
 toine tied the apron around guyons waist
 and helped him into the bob-tailed coat
 guyon pulled the battered felt hat down
 over his eyes and thrust his clothes upon
 antoine

   he urged the waiter toward the stairway
  make your way out by the service en-
 trance so the boys wont see you

   antoine seemed to fear that mr sutliffe
 might make trouble for him

    no chance no chance said guyon
  if you should lose your job call me up
 and ill get you another

   antoine finally went down the stairs
 guyon picked up the tray and waited until
 he could no longer hear the sound of his
 footsteps then he rang sutliffes bell he
 rang three times

   sutliffe opened the door on the chain
 guyon kept his head down as if he were
 concerned with steadying the tray the
 briefest of glances satisfied sutliffe that it
 was the waiter he expected and closing the
 door to throw off the chain he opened it
 wide he had no intention of letting the
 waiter inside though putting out his hands
 for the tray he said

    ill take it you neednt wait

   as sutliffe took the tray out of his hands
 randal contrived to give the door a little
 push with his foot so that it swung all the
 way back then he sidled in over the
 threshold

   get out said the astonished sutliffe
 randal murmured in a disguised voice
 something about his  check

    they know me at clareties said sut-
 liffe indignantly

   he was encumbered with the tray be-
 fore he could put the waiter out he had to
 turn and set it down on the oaken chest
 that gave randal his opening he darted
 into the dining room throwing down the
 absurd ha as he ran and calling softly

    diantha diantha t

 diantha was standing in the opening be-
 tween the two rooms

    you  she gasped

   a conflict of feelings terror shame anger
 overwhelmed her that man the son of
 the woman she was trying to save for the
 moment she lost her grip she covered her
 face

   sutliffe having prudently lingered to close
 the hall door rushed into the room beside
 himself with anger  get out of here you
 damned snooper  he cried

    not without her sutliffe said randal
 firmly

   diantha had recovered herself there
 wras but the one line possible for her to take
 though it killed her

    go she said  how dare you come
 spying on me

   sutliffe laughed  theres your answer
 get out

   it was like a blow in the face to guyon
 but he loved her well enough not to be
 moved by it

   to diantha he said  you were tricked
 into coming here dont you see it now
 it was a plot 

   diantha could have wrung her hands at
 the ghastly wrong of the situation she re-
 mained silent averting her face from ran-
 dal

    damn you have i got to thrash you
 again cried sutliffe

    yes said randal with a hard smile
  thats what i came for

   at that point the situation passed entirely
 out of dianthas control she could only
 look on wriggling out of the waiters coat
 randal flung it on the floor that most prim-
 itive of male gestures sutliffe followed
 suit a faint cry escaped from diantha
 and she covered her face again sutliffe
 angry as a bull charged randal randal
 nimbly side-stepped him and escaped
 around the table he was as cool as the
 other man was furious

   as sutliffe came after him he held up his
 hand with an authoritative gesture sut-
 liffe stopped disconcerted randal keep-
 ing the tail of an eye on the other man put
 his weight against the heavy table and rolled
 it into the corner suddenly becoming con-
 scious of the absurdity of the waiters apron


argosy-allstory weekly

randal pulled the string that confined it

and tossed that aside too

  sutliffe rushed him again this time
randal was not quick enough he received
a blow on the side of the head as from a
sledge hammer and crashed to the floor

  in that moment diantha acknowledged
her heart she ran toward the window
but randal was not knocked out by a good
bit

   keep away he cried  we want no
outsiders in this i can handle him

  diantha fell back sutliffe laughed his
confidence thoroughly restored

   get up if you want more he said

  he was crouching over randal prepared
to smash him the instant he started to rise
randal seeing that he would not fight fair
caught hold of one of his ankles and in
the act of rising butted his shoulder into
sutliffes chest the intended blow spent
itself on the air and sutliffe measured his
back on the rug

  he sprang up angrier than ever randal
was waiting for him on tiptoe across the
room that first blow had made him wary
sutliffe was still the heavier man and all
the training in the world could not equalize
that but randal was hard and sutliffe
was soft randals line clearly was to tire
the other man out he allowed stuliffe to
chase him around the room when he was
cornered he ducked

  sutliffe jeered and diantha thought her
defender was beaten she stole toward the
window again

   randal i must she murmured

   come away he cried in a voice that
astonished her how the sound of his name
on her lips had heartened him

   sutliffes face was purple

  stand still you damned coward he
cried thickly

  randal laughed  patience patience
youll get yours directly

  sutliffe caught him by the table and
randals head rang again to save him-
self he clinched they stamped and swayed
all over the room having clinched randal
could not tear himself loose sutliffe got
an arm about his neck and was bent on
strangling him randal got his knee up
between them and thrusting out broke the

other mans hold and sent him reeling back
sutliffe choking with rage tore his collar
open it was not a pretty fight

    look out you dont burst a blood ves-
sel steak face taunted randal you
eat too much for a scrapper

   sutliffe rushed him randal jerked his
head aside and sent in his own right with
every ounce of strength he possessed behind
it sutliffe dropped a little cry of en-
couragement escaped diantha she was
watching now with a fiery concentration
that had burned up all other feelings when
sutliffe perceived that warlike look in her
eye he was afraid to turn his back on her

   randal stood away while sutliffe scram-
bled to his feet sutliffe staggered to the
sideboard and before they realized what
he was after snatched up a cut glass liquor
bottle and hurled it at randals head it
went wide it smashed against the wall
beyond and the contents splashed and ran
down the embossed wall covering

   sutliffe caught up the remaining bottle of
the pair and kept it for a weapon hoarse-
ly panting for breath he threatened randal
with it

   randal made a feint of attacking sut-
liffe brought the bottle down harmlessly
as he raised his hand again randal struck
his wrist and the bottle flew out of his
hand randal rushed in sutliffe made for
the door randal at his heels as he ran
sutliffe swung a chair behind him and ran-
dal crashed over it sutliffe turning kicked
him viciously

   diantha was electrified she rushed- at
sutliffe like a flame struggling to get her
pistol out the man fell back dismayed
a second was all that randal required to
gain his feet

  thrusting diantha out of the way he
sailed into sutliffe with right and left the
latter was getting groggy he spent himself
in wild swings his defense was wide open
summoning all his strength randal sent
his right to the jaw sutliffe dropped and
lay inert

  randal looked down at him a little
stupidly in the moment of his long-
worked-for triumph he felt no triumph he
felt nothing he had accomplished his aim
and for the moment he felt as if he had lost

                           a
a new girl in town



 something the driving force was suddenly
 removed

 he was recalled to himself by a sound
 from diantha behind him she was weep-
 ing softly hurriedly weakly the little sobs
 stumbling over each other still he was
 curiously unmoved

    dont he said  its all right now
 diantha wiped away the tears they
 looked for a long time at each other and all
 sorts of thoughts came creeping between
 them-thoughts they could not face they
 looked away from each other

    lets go said randal at last

  wait murmured diantha theres
 something  must get watch him

   she ran into the next room snatching
 open the drawer of the desk she got the
 little key and opened the mahogany cabinet
 she dropped on her knees before the safe
 for a ghastly moment the figures deserted
 her but she closed her eyes and they came
 back as if written in fire inside her eyelids

   start at ten two turns to the left and
 stop at thirty three turns to the right and
 stop at seventy one-half turn back to
 twenty her hands trembled so that she
 made several misses finally the handle
 yielded under her hand and the little door
 swung heavily open

   a slight sound from the opening between
 the two rooms caused her to look up ran-
 dal was standing there watching her in
 amazement the jealous curiosity of a
 lover had been too strong for him diantha
 thrust the packet of letters inside her bodice
 but he could see what it was his face be-
 came distorted with suspicion jealousy
 rage

   what are you doing he demanded
 harshly

   diantha got to her feet  those are let-
 ters that sutliffe stole she said quickly
 randal came further into the room

    whose letters

   diantha was silent  what am i to do
   she thought despairingly sutliffe appeared
   in the opening behind randal he was
   staggering with weakness his face ghastly
   he had to lean against the door frame to
   support himself astonishment and rage
   contorted his pale features at the sight of
   the letters in dianthas hand then with
    a

 a glance at randal came malicious pleasure
 he chuckled hatefully

 whose letters repeated randal

diantha turned sick at heart but it was
not of herself she was thinking sutliffe
would now she supposed seeing that the
game was up tell randal out of pure devil-
ishness however sutliffe remained silent
enjoying the scene

  your letters cried randal

 oh no no no exclaimed diantha in-
voluntarily

 then show them to me cried randal
in a voice that grated with pain  i be-
lieve in you i want to believe in you
good god dont let him stand there laugh-
ing

 i have no right murmured diantha
from between stiff lips  they axe not
mine

 sutliffe laughed outright

  that sounds like a lying excuse cried
 randal beside himself  this is no time
 to stand on a point of honor anyhow if
 they dont concern me you know that i
 can keep my mouth shut

  i will not show them to you said dia-
 antha

  then they are your letters 

 they are not mine

 you have my permission to show them
to him jeered sutliffe

 will you take me away from this
place pleaded diantha

no cried randal not till you
show me those letters

 then i must go by myself

she moved toward the hall door ran-
dal with a rush gained it before her

 you shall not go until you have shown
me he cried

diantha was no tame woman her breast
burned with indignation at the injustice of
his suspicion she was sorely tempted to
show him the letters how it would crush
him how sweet it would be to bring him
to her feet begging for forgiveness but a
thought of the colonel restrained her it
would not be according to the colonels idea
of playing the game

 let me pass she said  what right
have you-

 right he cried wildly   believed


argosy -allstory weekly

in you through thick and thin i loved
you i fought for you i knocked him
out oh god only to have him give me
the laugh and you ask me what right
i dont care whether i have any right or
not ill make a right

  she thought she could subdue him she
started firmly for the door one hand on
her breast where the letters were but she
saw that he was quite mad with rage and
pain he meant to seize her

    would you dare to touch me she said
faltering

    you trr to get out and youll see

    youre no better than he is

    i dont care show me those letters
the situation was hopeless she could
do no more as randal came toward her
with his head down sutliffe enjoying the
scene from the other doorway diantha
turned and fled back across the room to a
side window she flung up the sash

  randal reached her with a bound he
thought she meant to throw herself out
perhaps he dragged her away from the
window and pulled down the sash again
but diantha knew her signal would not be
missed

   for the moment all the rage was fright-
ened out of randal he was imploring now
he followed her about the room pleading

    diantha show me those letters good
god dont you see how you are torturing
me what if they are your letters i can
make allowances for ignorance-or even
folly i could forgive you anything-or
almost anything if only you do not tty to
hide things from me

    you have nothing to forgive she said
indignantly  i told you the letters were
not mine

   how can i believe that if you wont
show them to me with him laughing there
im sorry for the ugly things i said im
begging you now diantha put me out of
my misery one way or the other 

this was harder for her to bear than his
rage  you are only tormenting yourself
she said painfully  you have no reason
but he continued to follow her about and
to plead

   in the middle of it the bell rang followed
by an imperative knock on the door

    thats colonel flowerday said dian-
 tha  better open the door or hell break
 it in

   randals face turned ugly with suspicion
 again he ran down the hall and opened
 the door diantha followed him part way
 sutliffe made his way to the door from the
 dining room into the hall his expression
 suggested that he knew his jig was up
 anyway and intended to get what fun he
 could out of watching his enemies destroy
 themselves

   outside the door colonel flowerday was
 revealed a couple of determined-looking
 men behind him and several inquisitive
 hallboys looking over their shoulders

    let them all stay outside said di-
 antha

    at the sight of her protector her strength
 began to fail her she could do no more
 than waver to his supporting arm

   the door was closed

   at the sight of randal the colonel had
 paled  good god what is he doing
 here he murmured

   diantha whispered to him  he doesnt
 know

   randal saw that whisper  ha heres
 the other one he cried quite mad with
 jealousy  the old blackguard tell me
 will you what you are to these two men
 and ill go

    tell him whispered diantha to the
 colonel

     as to sutliffe said the colonel gravely
  she came here to get some letters that he
 stole and that he has been using to black-
 mail a lady as to me -he hesitated a
 moment- i am her father

   there was a silence broken only by the
 sound of dianthas suppressed sobs sut-
 liffe was staring at the colonel in stupefac-
 tion

   suddenly randal laughed wildly peal
 after peal

  oh expect me to believe that
thats a bit too thick so extreme was
his anguish he could even turn to sutliffe
the man he had just thrashed  hear that
sut rich eh you called me a soft-
headed fool once by god you were
right

 colonel flowerday caught up dianthas

cloak from the chest where it lay opening
the door he drew her out and closed it
behind them

chapter xxv

conclusion

at eleven oclock next morning colonel
flowerday had himself carried to the
renaissance chateau that had housed
the last two generations of the guyon fam-
ily in new york once more he was ushered
into the intimate reception room furnished
in the delicate old world fashion created a
century and a half ago brought back dur-
ing the last generation and now becoming
a little old-fashioned again

  to him there after the briefest space of
time came the slender graceful mistress of
the house almost running in all the years
he had known her the colonel had never
seen nancy guyon so nearly lose her com-
posure her face was as white as paper
her eyes wild with suspense

   crispin she gasped you said you
would not come here again until-until-

  her breath failed her she involuntarily
clasped her hands

  from his pocket the colonel had taken
a packet of faded blue envelopes confined
by an elastic band he silently handed it
over

  she caught it to her breast without a
sound and dropped into a chair her face
became even more bloodless her head
dropped back he thought she was about
to faint and looked around for a bell to
summon help

   no no she whispered  dont bring
anybody its only the relief

  tears forced themselves from under her
closed eyelids and she began to sob quietly
he saw that the crisis had passed it
seemed to him that the kindest thing was to
wait in silence until she had regained her
control

  finally she began to speak in a low voice
checked by sobs  crispin-nobody knows
what i have suffered for five years i have
not known a really happy moment nor a
quiet night of sleep-i cannot believe all
at once that the nightmare is over-

  he was standing beside her chair bending
down to catch her broken words suddenly
she caught up his hand and pressed it to her
lips

  he snatched it away a little scandalized
 oh nancy you mustnt not to me
it shames me anyway i have done noth-
ing it wasnt i who got them back for
you

  u it was she she murmured

   yes it was my girl

   how can i ever repay her

   the colonel was silent a little grim

  mrs guyon was quickly herself again
a delicate color returned to her cheeks she
counted the letters each was still con-
tained in its opened envelope

   ten yes theyre all here she re-
garded them with an extraordinary sadness
 poor innocent little letters to have caused
so much unhappiness written out of the
purest feelings of my heart

  she took off the rubber band and taking
the top letter in her hands let the others
fall in her lap she started to tear the
letter across but the tough paper resisted
her something caused her to look up in
the colonels face it was drawn and har-
assed not at all the face of a man who
had just successfully accomplished a diffi-
cult task his expression caused her to ask
involuntarily

   dont you think they ought to be de-
stroyed

   i suppose so he said

   crispin has anything serious hap-
pened

    thats all in the point of view

  tell me

  he drew a chair close to hers and sitting
began to speak rapidly

  she only interrupted him once  randal
there she cried  how did that happen
 hes in love with my girl muttered
the colonel pulling his mustache

   yes i know murmured nancy very
low poor lad

   he must have been watching her fol-
lowing her the colonel went on  he
forced his way into sutliffes rooms with
some idea of saving her i suppose

  go on go on she whispered breath-
lessly


argosy-allstory weekly

   at the conclusion of his tale she exclaimed
aloud in astonishment your daughter
crispin your daughter 

    but ive been telling you right along it
was my girl

   nancy turned her head

    i-i understood it differently she
stammered

    you knew i had been married he said
 yes i heard something-years ago
never any details i supposed she was
dead

    she is dead

    i never heard of a child

    nothing strange in that he said  i
had forgotten her myself

    forgotten her exclaimed nancy

    i must tell you the whole story now
twenty years ago i was still an engineer
it was before i had been drawn into the
bigger game i was sent with a staff to sur-
vey certain anthracite prospects along the
southern border of new york state we
wtere lodged in a village called farrowdale
a storybook village green-clad hills and
rich farms in the bottoms but we found it
slow in our hours of ease out of sheer
boredom we went to church it was in
church that i first saw mary lore-pray-
ing

   he cleared his husky voice and went on
 i fell in love at sight we all did
we got introduced through the parson
there was hard feeling among the fellows
i beat them all out i was the most experi-
enced and mary-i carried her off her
feet she had never seen anybody like me
 what was she like whispered nancy
 cant go into details he muttered
 youll have me blubbering presently my
girl is a little like her sometimes i forget
and think she is mary but she has a bold-
er a more vivid spirit mary was shy re-
ticent i called her-bluebell her hair
was pale gold-like corn silk we were
married after a fortnights courtship

    for a few- months we were angelically
happy then the prospects of anthracite
around farrowdale petered out and my job
there was done it was then that i received
an offer to develop the coal mines belonging
to the crown of westphalia it seemed best
to leave my tender mary at home until i

saw what there was in it so i went abroad
alone

    months passed our baby was bom
 my job turned out to be the great oppor-
 tunity of my life and i could not leave it
 and mary could not travel with a young
 baby how can i tell you what was hap-
 pening in my absence one of the young
 engineers on my former staff had returned to
 farrowdale and was making love to my
 wife oh he was clever concealed his
 hand laid a regular patient siege told her
 lies about me

    when i got back to america the mis-
 chief was done never mind the details
 it nearly broke my heart but never for a
 moment have i blamed mary it was her
 innocent ignorance her softness of heart
 that betrayed her what chance had a sim-
 ple country girl against an accomplished
 villain like that

    i allowed her to divorce me and she
 married him to do him credit he was
 madly in love with her i laid no claim to
 the baby because i thought a childs proper
 place was with her mother i never even
 saw the baby i went back to europe and
 was quickly drawn into great affairs i
 never heard of them again

    what happened was that mary died
 within a short time of her second marriage
 and her husband disappeared the baby
 was left to the care of agnes lore marys
 sister who carried the child away to a place
 where her unhappy story was not known
 and gave her her mothers family name-
 lore but this i did not know

     i heard nothing of them until the after-
 noon of that day that i last saw you here
 on my return home i was greeted in my
 own drawing-room by this charming girl
 who said  i am diantha lore i think per-
 haps my right name is diantha flowerday

     i leave you to imagine what my feelings
 were i am older now and my heart is
 softer

 she was not sure you see that she was
my daughter her aunt a bitter proud wo-
man never told her the facts of her birth
the death of her aunt left her alone in the
world and she had returned to farrowdale
hoping to find friends or relatives there
she had heard a garbled version of her
a new girl in town



mothers story and she came to me for the
truth at first i concealed the truth from
her i wanted to test her but she soon
showed me she was as clever and good as
she was beautiful

    but crispin said mrs guyon in dis-
tress  oh i know its not for me to ask it
but i must ask it how could you put your
own daughter in such a position

   he pulled his mustache  i thought that
would be self-evident after i told you my
story ive seen a lot of mfe in the last
tw-enty years a lot of the seamy side not
alone my own unhappiness but yours too
and scores of other cases have taught me
that half the tragedies of life are due to
those very qualities that we so carefully cul-
tivate in our girls i mean their ignorance
of evil their lovely innocence their tender-
ness-

   ah thats true murmured mrs
guyon

   well the minute i laid eyes on that
girl of mine so beautiful so clear-eyed so
confiding i swore i would arm her against
evil with every weapon i possessed i took
her completely into my confidence i al-
lowed her to share my lile took her every-
where showed her everything

    i concealed her relation to me so that
she would not be treated with any false re-
spect it happened that with her clever-
ness and charm she made an ideal instru-
ment to carry out the business i had in
hand she undertook it with enthusiasm
i need hardly tell you that i took care to
protect her from any real danger

   there was a silence in the little room
finally mrs guyon asked very low  is
she-is she in love with my boy

  the colonel jumped up with a gesture
of distress and perplexity

   i dont know he cried  at first i
suspected she was confound him but i
can get nothing out of her now she has
shut herself up turned hard as stone i
dont know what to do

  mrs guyon thought first of her own
child

   good heavens she cried  how he
must have suffered this night and i dont
know where he is first i must find him
then ill know what to do

  an hour later colonel flowerday brought
mrs guyon to his own house afraid of
betraying too much in his face he dared not
himself announce her to diantha but sent
gumpel to tell diantha that a lady wished
to see her who had not given any name

  diantha answered quickly  i cant see
her i cant see any one

  gumpel would not take that for an an-
swer

   excuse me miss if its not a liberty
i think you ought to see this one

   why

   shes a lady when youre sure youre
sure

  dianthas instincts were alarmed she
feared-she didnt know wthat but some-
thing that threatened the peace of mind she
was struggling to achieve

   no she said  i dont doubt shes
what you say but i cant see strangers
if she wants a subscription or something
let her write to me

    might be just a friendly call suggested
gumpel

   why doesnt she send up her name
then

   cant say miss if i should be mis-
taken in her ill be right there in the hall
to show her out

   no  cried diantha becoming exasper-
ated  what makes you so persistent
gumpel

   i dont know miss he said slyly  i
have as they say a hunch that you ought
to see this lady

  at the unexpected answer dianthas
drawn face relaxed then she could no
longer hold out  all right she said  ill
go down

  in the henri iv room diantha found a
pretty woman with an exquisite air such as
it takes at least three generations to pro-
duce she wras agitated yet she came to-
ward diantha in a wray as direct and frank
as dianthas own

   so this is what youre like she said
breathlessly  they have not overrated
you

   dianthas eye fell under her terrible scru-
tiny-though there was nothing unkind
in it

   i am mrs guyon she said


argosy -allstory weekly

  her apparent youth had put diantha off
her guard the girl started and a painful
blush mantled her face

  nancy thought sadly t ah she does
love him 

  the mother experienced both jealousy
and tenderness

   dont try to thank me said diantha
painfully

    im not going to try said nancy sim-
ply  words wouldnt convey it if youll
let me be your friend maybe time will
show

   you are very kind

   no its as randals mother that i
came

   again the painful blush

   i -nancy came to a dead stop she
spread out her hands appealingly  i
came-it is difficult isnt it randal has
been talking to me about you for weeks
but of course i hadnt seen you then i
didnt know- she made a fresh start
 hes in love with you she said simply
 you know that i expect

  diantha lowered her head

    and youre in love with him i think
 what makes you say that diantha
asked sharply  did he tell you

   he did not he doesnt know it poor
dear but i am a woman like yourself
i have eyes why shouldnt you love him
he is very lovable

   dont you see how it hurts to have
anybody guess it murmured diantha

  this was so like randals own cry that
nancys heart was deeply touched she
lowered her eyes

   oh i know you may be sure i shant
tell him

   you are doing this out of gratitude
murmured diantha painfully  you will
be sorry for it later there can be nothing
between me and-and your son

  nancy interrupted her sharply  grati-
tude do you think i could sacrifice him
however grateful i might be im doing
it for his sake hell be here directly

   coming here gasped diantha

   i havent seen him said nancy  i
just telephoned mr oddie to bring him
he doesnt know im here youll see him
wont you

  no no said diantha no good
 could come of it i can make no explana-
 tions

   no but i can said mrs guyon mean-
  ingly

  diantha looked at her in a sort of horror

   you mustnt she cried  i couldnt
  let you

  hes on the way i cant stop him
 now

   colonel flowerday must speak to you
  said diantha agitatedly  you must not
  be allowed to do this thing

  she rang for a servant

  im doing it for randal persisted
 nancy

 a footman entered

   ask colonel flowerday if he will please
  come here said diantha

 the man went out

   it is useless to try to stop me said
  nancy  my mind is made up-diantha 

  she held out her arms before she well
  knew what was happening diantha found
  herself imprisoned within them

  oh my dear whispered nancy if
 you make him happy i shall love you for-
 ever he has a terrible capacity for hap-
 piness my poor lad-or for misery

  you frighten me murmured diantha
  all i can do is love him 

   thats all he wants said nancy

 the colonel found them in each others
 arms he looked out of the window and
 pulled his mustache

 the footman reentered to announce mr
 guyon diantha and nancy sprang apart
 each seeking desperately to remove the
 traces of tears randal came into the room
 almost on the servants heels he looked
 haggard and reckless he stopped dead
 and looked blankly from one to another of
 the three persons in the room

 mother he cried what are you
 doing here

  colonel flowerday and i are old
 friends she said hurriedly

 old friends he said dazed why
 was i never told that

  for the moment nancy ignored his ques-
  tion

  colonel flowerday has told me every-
 thing that took place last night she said
a new girl in town



  randal scowled  why did you have to
be dragged into this

   because i am the person most con-
cerned dear

  both the colonel and diantha made am
involuntary imploring gesture for her to
stop but she waved it aside

    you said randal  this is all greek
to me

  nancy had an embroidered black velvet
bag hanging from her arm she fumbled
nervously with the strings

    diantha got certain letters out of sut-
liffes safe she said  you asked her to
show them to you and she refused well

i will show them to you now she had
got the bag open and was holding out the
packet of faded blue letters

  randals look had grown more and more
amazed  how did you get hold of them
he demanded

    they are my letters that is to say i
wrote them diantha was recovering them
for me

   he was staring at the letters as at ac-
cursed things he made no move to touch
them

   take them urged nancy

  he finally took them in a daze and
turned the packet over in his hands

  she kept on unfalteringly they were
written years ago to a man i loved he is
dead i am not ashamed of them i want
you to read them

  at last comprehension seemed to break
on him it was her handwriting that he
recognized

  nancy yours he cried loudly
 good god what a fool i have been 

  he cast an extraordinary look in dian-
thas direction her head was turned away
 read them urged nancy

   no he cried  what do you think
i am do you think i could doubt you
what is it to me what letters you have writ-
ten maynt i destroy them nancy

    yes if you wish she said faintly

  he looked around instinctively for some
means of destroying them on the spot
there was a wood fire laid in the antique
fireplace but it was not lighted

   can i start this going sir randal
asked the colonel

   by all means by all means  said the
colonel gruffly  the room is cold

  randal dropped to his knees in front of

the fireplace and put a match to the tinder
a little flame poked its way up through
the interstices of the logs one by one ran-
dal tore up the letters and fed them to the
fire the other three persons watched him
fascinated and no one said a word

  when at last he got up he did not turn
around right away a horrible constraint
fell upon all four

  it was nancy who broke the silence she
said nervously to the colonel  wont you
show me about your new house cris-
pin

  the colonel promptly offered her his ami
diantha put out a beseeching hand to stay
them but they walked out of the room

  when randal turned around he stole a
glance in dianthas face she seemed en-
tirely composed indeed she had almost
a forbidding air

  diantha looked at him too but he never
guessed it girls have that art there was
no confidence in his bearing he looked
frightened out of his wits that made her
feel better but she was unable to give him
any encouragement she did not speak
because she could not be offhand and to
speak formally would have been absurd
she sat down on a little sofa between the
two front windows he dared not take the
seat beside her until diantha called his at-
tention to it his humility most sweetly
soothed her wounded pride

   it was good of you to let me come
here he mumbled

   i am glad to have you said diantha

  exactly like amateurs in a badly re-
hearsed play

   shall we join the others upstairs sug-
gested diantha

   not just yet stammered randal

  a silence fell between them a devastat-
ing silence diantha looked straight ahead
of her she was keenly aware of his im-
ploring deep dark eyes but she could not
stir in the end nature had its way with
him he put out his trembling hand and
touched hers instantly her fingers twined
warmly around his and they were drowtied
in bliss

immortal frauds

mastered medicine

by captain horatio wragge

in the third century before our era there dwelt at athens a gifted and exquisite girl with an
insatiable thirst for knowledge her parents were poor and she found it necessary to earn a
precarious livelihood by combing the tresses of the wives of successful rhetoricians in due time
she accumulated a competence from the proceeds of which she hoped to be able to pay for
instruction in the sciences medicine was the specialty to which she was peculiarly attracted her
name was agnodice

     the only instructor to whom it occurred to agnodice to resort was hierophilus one of the
most brilliant of the physicians of antiquity his lectures on the science of medicine were
thronged daily not only by athenian youths who longed to become doctors but by individuals
from persia syracuse and even the remote peninsula of sirmio the students of hierophilus
were renowned as far as the pillars of hercules for the skill with which they checked fevers
and of the master himself it was affirmed that he could bring the hopeless invalid leaping with
joy from a sickbed to the theatre

     agnodice accordingly enrolled herself among the pupils of hierophilus but that renowned
healer threw up his hands in horror and amazement at the mere suggestion that a female
be permitted to study so severe a science as that of medicine he assured the weeping agnodice
that he had never heard of such a thing in his life it seemed to him inconsistent with the
delicacy of her sex he suddenly remembered an ancient law passed some hundred and fifty
years previously in which the practice of medicine by a woman was denounced as impious

     the entreaties of agnodice and her reminders that the statute in question was obsolete had no
effect upon the master of the art of medicine at athens in tears at her rebuff agnodice withdrew
to the home of the wife of a rhetorician who listened with indignation to her version of the
mornings event

      if i were you she said  i would dress myself in mans clothes and attend the lectures
under a mans name

    agnodice objected that she did not know how to walk like a man or how to compete with
the men students of hierophilus in their rougher sports now and then they came to blows
at the lectures when they could not agree with their preceptor regarding the value of this or
that feature of his therapy the wife of the rhetorician undertook to school agnodice in such
practices for she had long been married and often came to blows with her husband profiting by
such instruction the eager agnodice soon learned to deport herself in all respects like a young
man and to use the fashionable oaths of the city in a strong voice

     she presented herself in due time at the lectures having previously inscribed herself under
a fictitious name and speedily absorbed all the knowledge of the master hierophilus himself
was edified by her progress and as she had given herself out as a persian in exile because of the
civil wars then distracting the realm of the great king certain inconsistencies of accent and of
demeanor were readily accounted for agnodice licensed to heal set herself up in athens
as a physician making a specialty of midwifery

     her skill became obvious from the first and the wife of the rhetorician who had befriended
her kept her secret so well that nobody suspected it agnodice built up a splendid practice
among all classes of society and in due time she had many of the gilded youth of the city
among her patients her midwifery moreover was so skilled that not one woman attended by
agnodice ever died in childbed

    the other physicians of the city now began to feel jealous of the young doctor they
were displeased with her popularity among the young women of athens who found her
ministrations as soothing as they were efficient the daughter of a great landed proprietor confessed
that in gratitude for her delivery from a fever she had kissed her physician there was an uproar
among the medical faculty at this development and the confused agnodice found herself on trial
in public before the courts on a charge that she was corrupting the morals of her patients
various young women were driven to confess that they had in the exuberance of their appreciation
embraced this seductive healer

    the evidence against agnodice proved overwhelming and her judges moved though they
were by her youth and beauty found it impossible to bring in any verdict but guilty thereupon
agnodice with many blushes confessed that she was masquerading in the habiliments of a male

 i am woman she cried amid the wildest uproar

    the jealous physicians who had instigated the prosecution now resurrected the ancient
law which forbade any member of agnodices sex from practicing the profession of medicine
there was every prospect that she would be condemned to death but the wife of the rhetorician
who had suggested the imposture in the beginning now organized a revolt among the women
of athens the mothers who owed their delivery from the pangs of labor to the skill of agnodice
came forward with tears to entreat that the life of their physician be spared and amid a tumult
of enthusiasm the obnoxious law was abolished

hanson headquarters detective
dived through the entrance to the
department store catapulting like
a bombshell the length of the long aisle to
the scandal and confusion of the mid-after-
noon shoppers just ahead in the swirl and
eddy of the crowd a lithe figure wove in and
out with the practiced ease of a football
player going through a broken field a mo-
ment he showed against the sunlight pour-
ing through the opposite entrance-then he
was gone into the teeming street

   but the plainclothesman was not far be-
hind even as his quarry erupted into the
thoroughfare the detectives hand reach-
ing made a darting thrust-it closed on
empty air however with a last swerving
dodge of the tall figure in the tan overcoat

   again vanishing vardaman had made his
get-away melting into the hurrying throng
his flying coat tails whipped around the
corner as hanson his hands balling into
fists made after with what speed he might

   it had not been the first time that the no-
torious dip and strong-arm had

evaded him and at the very moment as it
seemed of victory for the hound of the
law for vanishing vardaman had got
his name for the same reason that had made
him a thorn in the side of the department
for a longer time than hanson for example
cared to think of and the man had seemed
to take an especial delight in setting the
dogs of the police by the ears-with him it
might have been a game and a sporting one
had it not been that the stakes were a little
heavier than in any mere contest of speed
and wit

   but so far vardaman had pitted his sin-
gle wits against the resources of the entire
police force of a great city-and so far
turning and doubling like a fox he had won
clear

   but this time hanson swore there would
be a different ending he made after the
fugitive now with a dogged determination

   vardaman never affected any disguises
rather he seemed to delight in a distinctive
dress which if anything rendered him more
conspicuously noticeable that tan coat-




argosy-allstory weekly

hanson could see it even now-or he
thought that he could and then abruptly
not ten paces in advance he saw it again
swaying to the lift and drive of the power-
ful shoulders almost within arms reach
the tan coat and the shapeless soft hat of
vanishing vardaman

  a leap-and the detectives blunt fingers
had closed upon his quarrys wrist in a grip
of iron

   now - mr vanishing vardaman -
guess well take a little walk- he was be-
ginning when abruptly at the face which
he beheld his mouth fell open in amaze
mumbling an apology he backed off his
face crimson in his chagrin

  for the face that he had seen was not
vanishing vardamans-it was that of a
total stranger

  again his quarry had eluded him some-
where now doubtless safe in that haven
which the department had never been able
to discover the vanishing one sat and
gloated

   hanson raging swung off at right angles
to his course he was now in a residential
section-the street drowsed in the hot after-
noon sun peaceful silent empty head
down the plainclothesman went onward
wearily and with dragging step he was
tired and it was the way he always felt
following his numerous encounters with this
fox without wings

  disgustedly he trudged onward the
sun was burning hot the asphalt under-
foot seemed of the consistency of molten
lava life was after all just a mocking
ironic jest at the expense of him detective
hanson and the jester who mocked was
that sleek slim debonair adventurer known
as vanishing vardaman

   and then in a second in a flash of time
the plainclothesmans weariness vanished
even as had the figure of the fugitive back
there on the crowded avenue plunging for-
ward at a pounding run hanson his chagrin
forgotten in the sudden abrupt need for
action went forward at the double-quick

   for there sauntering idly along the tree-
shaded thoroughfare was-vanishing vard-
aman tan coat soft hat gardenia in the
buttonhole of the coat-and this time there
could be no mistake

   even as he sprang forward the detective
had seen that hawklike countenance like a
falcon a bird of prey-it was surely he
at last in a moment now they would have
him where he would be secure

  vardaman had heard nothing suspected
nothing as it seemed on the hot asphalt
the detectives rubber-soled shoes made no
sound curiously enough it had never once
occurred to him to pull his gun perhaps
so strong was his desire to lay hands upon
the will-o-the-wisp he had never intended
using it vardaman perhaps a half block
in advance was swinging along with a loose
easy stride all unconscious as it appeared
of the nemesis at his back and now just
in front of him a wagon loomed-it was
backed sidewise across the walk

  vardaman passed that wagon hanson
saw him pass it a matter of seconds before
he too rounded it it was ahuge motor
truck sidewise it effectually blocked pas-
sage save by the street

  hanson skirted it in full career and
then-he stopped dead his expression a cur-
ious mixture of amaze chagrin and sheer
stolid stupefaction

  for vardaman had vanished

  the street stretched bare and empty
under the declining sun there was no sign
of vardaman anywhere he had disappeared
as utterly as if he had been snatched up
into a fourth dimension ready to hand

  the plainclothesman stared blinking
owlishly in the strong sunlight then he
glanced downward at the coal hole but the
lid was on-it was shut tight he turned
to two grimy men appearing suddenly
around the end of the truck for a moment
hanson entertained the impossible suspicion
that one of them might be the man whom he
sought

   but the fugitive even supposing that he
knew that he was being followed would
scarcely have had time to make the light-
ning shift from debonair pedestrian to
black-faced coal heaver

   hanson shrugged turning to the men with
a brief

    seen anything of a tall man-light tan
overcoat-flower in his buttonhole-soft
hat he passed by here just a moment
ago
vanishing vardaman



  the men stared then as with one voice

   we aint seen nobody mister they
told him  weve been here the best part
of two hours and weve put in a couple
tons-no mister if anybody had passed
wed have seen him certain sure

  hanson contrived a grimace that was
meant to be a smile plainly what they
thought of him had not been expressed in
words he scowled-then at a dragging
walk went onward along the street van-
ishing vardaman had once more made good
his sobriquet-the fox had won

h

  all was quiet in the great house on the
comer dreaming in the late afternoon sun
and in the dimness belowstairs there was a
thick velvety darkness-dark as soot-
musty one might have said save for a faint
acrid tang rising out of the depths

  abruptly the silence of the great cellar
was broken by a prodigious sneeze there
came a muffled curse-then the bright beam
of a flashlight danced glimmering upon
floor and wall

  a shapeless figure showed as a dim blot
of darker shadow behind the circle of the
flash then fumbling at the wall switch that
acrid coal dust caught him once again
and once more there came that mighty
sneeze shaking the rafters overhead as it
seemed to the prowler there in the cellar

  vanishing vardaman waited a tense mo-
ment hand over his nostrils but no sound
answered him to tell him that he was dis-
covered in the split second that he had
circled that coal truck there before him
had yawned that open coal hole and for
the split second that he was invisible to
hanson and to the two who labored upon
the other side of the truck he had made
his exit preceding the clamping of that lid
by a margin so close that even now he could
hear the clanging rattle of its closing just
above his head

  at the moment that he had circled the
truck he had known that the plainclothes-
man was behind him and his decision had
been taken almost without conscious
thought but-he was safe hanson had
gone on-of that he was now convinced

but that light switch had not answered to
the pressure of his finger-that might have
told him something clever as he was but
he was thinking merely that it was for-
tunate that his flashlight had not been
broken in his somewhat unconventionally
hasty ingress

  he had waited a moment listening with
all his ears then he had heard the pur-
ring of the motor the coal shovelers were
going they had clamped on that lid-on
him vanishing vardaman-that was a
noble jest indeed for the prison was not
made that would hold him because-they
would never get him into it

  the family were probably upstairs at
dinner it would be an easy matter for
vardaman to make his get-away if he so
desired but the house was a large one
there were in all probability excellent pick-
ings to be had abovestairs he would collect
his tribute on the way out and no one ever
the wiser

  but as he went forward now into the vel-
vet black he was recalling that hectic mo-
ment as he had rounded the motor truck
for a breathless half second it had been
touch and go-and he had stood not upon
the order of his going

  the house was a large one that much
he had noticed casually as he had
come round the comer-but there was
a something else there had been a some-
thing about that house that he had sensed
rather than seen-but at the moment he was
unable to recall it if he had but known
it it was connected with the failure of that
light switch but this faded presently with
his discovery of something else

  for a little time now he had been aware
of a silence-it pounded in his ears with
the tension of his hard-held breath as slow-
ly carefully his flashlight held gingerly be-
fore him he began to mount a long stairway
that seemed to run upward interminably
into an even deeper gloom

  characteristically he walked on that side
of the stair nearest the wall as a precaution
against possible disclosure but it was a
wasted precaution if he had but known it
those stairs were solid like iron they gave
forth no sound to the pressure of his careful
footfall and even if they had the sound


argosy-allstory weekly

would scarcely have been heard even in
that singing silence

   the flash steadied centered upon a door
it gave outward silently to his slow stealthy
pressure as like a great cat he stepped
through the opening to find himself in a
sort of closet

  carefully he opened another door the
flashlights beam falling upon bright copper
and shiny nickel he was in the kitchen

  but the room was dark and silent lis-
tening with all his ears he heard merely
the sound of his own breathing loud in the
stillness-then after a moment came the
clang and rattle of a motor from the street
without as through many thicknesses of
walls

  but if that silence was odd the darkness
was out of place the sun yet lacked a
half hour of its setting and yet that kitchen
was dark almost with a midnight darkness
and the silence held

  vardaman abating somewhat his caution
passed with his swift silent step into a
room lofty-ceilinged-the dining room-
but there was no one there

  vardaman grinned in the darkness with a
silent chuckle this was indeed better than
he had hoped for the house was empty-
tenantless rather the failure of the light
switch might have told him that well
there was plenty of time for his inspection
and he would leave nothing of value that he
could take away with him soon it would
be night and to leave that house unseen
would be an easy matter-for vanishing
vardaman

  the house was an old-fashioned one on
an old-fashioned street he doubted that
it had been wired for burglary but moving
with an inbred caution he found the wire
after a little ripped it out with a twist of
his powerful pincers the while humming a
little tune

  why it would be too easy mounting
the stairs to the second floor he found that
which he sought an old-fashioned escri-
toire-just the sort of thing one would ex-
pect to come upon in an old-fashioned
house tenanted by old-fashioned folk who
had an inbred dislike for such new-fangled
inventions as safe-deposit boxes

  and there were jewels in it-not many-

but the intruders eyes bulged as he swept
them up and into his pocket he need go
no further literally vanishing vardaman
had fallen down a coat hole and come up
wearing diamonds

   still humming that wordless melody he
passed down the stair and outward to the
front door

   it was night now and he might as well
be going and then after some little diffi-
culty unlocking and swinging wide the
heavy double doors he recoiled stepping
backwtard with a startled oath

   for that front door was boarded up

   vardaman knew that it would be useless
and worse than useless to attempt an exit
through that heavy oaken barrier locked
as he knewr well with a patent lock and
from the outside the cellar was below
the level of the street the windows mere
oubliettes-there was no exit that way
but the windows on the ground floor-that
should be easy

   he tried the first and it ran up smooth-
 ly enough under his hand and then-he saw
 that it too was sealed likewise with oak-
 a barrier which do what he would he
 would not pass

   an ax yes if he could find one would
take him through it but the battering crash
of it against the heavy wood-the risk
would be too great now for the first time
in his chancy life vardaman knew panic
or something that approached it as mount-
ing the stair again here too he found his
wray barred by boarded windows like blind
eyes fronting him at every turn

   the house stood alone its nearest neigh-
 bor a good twenty feet away and there
 was not even a gutter pipe down which he
 might have coasted to safety even had he
 cared to risk it for of an ice-cold nerve
 and of a courage second to none vanishing
 vardaman could not abide the heights
 shaking now he drew backward from the
 black well of the dark along that rooftop
 whither he had come mounting the skylight
 ladder in a final desperate questing for the
 egress that was denied him

   like a fly in a bottle a rat in a trap
 vanishing vardaman was at last a prisoner
 and-he had literally put his head into the
 noose
vanishing vardaman



  that coal hole had been a man trap but
he had never known it

  with shaking fingers he thumbed in ms
pockets for his cigarettes but he could not
find his case-the elaborate gold-mounted
affair that he had lifted by the supermagic
of his facile fingers under the very nose
of an unsuspecting clerk in a smart shop on
the avenue

  somewhere he had lost it he could not
remember where and now even the solace
of a smoke was denied him

   presently he fell to pacing back and forth
on the great rug by the door the cellar
was hopeless  there was not a window in the
house but might have been sheet steel for
all he could have won to freedom through
them

   and the loot in his pocket-it might have
sufficed for a kings ransom but it would
not serve to take him an inch beyond his
prison house

  and he had been unable to find a single
implement that would have served his pur-
pose without noise sufficient to bring down
about his ears the minions of the law

  now as a caged tiger paces up an down
vardaman walked up and down that rug
his brain like a squirrel in a treadmill go-
ing round and round and coming back again
and again to that single hopeless answer
he was trapped

  abruptly something seemed to snap in
his mind with a sort of singing crash hurl-
ing himself upon the door he beat upon it
with his fists in a futile protest against

fate then backing the length of the long
rug he hurled himself forward shoulder-
high against the steadfast barrier

  there came a sudden snap-the wooden
leaves swung outward hurling him forward
upon his hands and knees he knew it
then some one had unlocked the door-
some one was waiting for him in the light
of the sputtering corner arc he looked then
looked again heard as from dim leagues of
distance the voice filled with a biting sar-
casm

   well well mr vanishing vardaman-
welcome to our city 

  the hand holding the gun was thrust
almost in his face in the other something
that glinted dully under the light his ciga-
rette case as in a daze he listened now
to the words of hanson

   well that was pretty smooth varda-
man-as a vanishing act it was pretty fair
even for you-you just dropped in ha
and-my my you sure look pretty-
dirty ill say so but you left this behind
you-very careless of you and you didnt
notice that the house was boarded up of
course but i had my suspicions and at
that i mightnt have remembered which
house it was if it hadnt been for-the evi-
dence but i think wed have salted you
without it at that

  the detectives tone became crisp au-
thoritative

   now vardaman youll do your last
vanishing act and that  be-up the
river

                      tr

 garden guesses

chould the daffodilly dally with the lily of the valley

    would the crocus just as loudly as he could

 would they rouse narcissuspicions by their reckless exhibitions
 till the primrose up in anger as he should

 if the violet them do it would the pair still later rue it

 would their passion flower in one ecstatic kiss

 would a bleeding heart be dripping while a lover false was skipping
 or would bridal wreath be sure to seal their bliss

received via w  mcgeehan

the sport of kings

    ust about the time that his confidant is busiest grinding out the latest in the
    sport line for his newspaper izzy kaplan is distressingly likely to strolfin and
    halt the galloping typewriter of w o mcgeehan to impart some information
    the writer could get along without

        consequently it was with a combination of uneasiness and relief that
   mcgeehan realized that the paper had come off the thundering presses without
   a single interruption from izzy in fact izzy had not so much as stuck his nose
   in the sporting department

        just as the silent partner was heading homeward however a bent drooping
    figure with dusty trouser legs appeared it was izzy-but not the izzy that
    mcgeehan knew for instead of pouring out floods of dope the pathetic figure
    appealed only for a dollar to buy some foot powder com plasters and transpor-
    tation to the bronx it developed that izzy had been to the race track and had
    walked back convinced that racing was the sport of kings but not of kaplans-
    the editor

chust found out how it is that so many kinks have lost it
their chobs over in europe on account i have been inwestigat-
ing the sport of kinks which it is race horsing i went down
to one of the racing trecks with a newspaper feller named
yaphank benneh which he is selling newspapers on
park row and is in business for himseluf making
a nice living he aint like one of those fellers
who is writing pieces for the papers on a celery
he is a business man

for me to stick by him and i would be wearing
diamonds on account he never inwested no money in a racing horse unless he had it
the positive information and he got it his information right out from the feed box

     izzy he told me  look out for toots when you are down at the racing trecks
on account they would try to give you a lot of bum steers

    it is a new kind of lankwitch for me on account i could only speak english rus-
sian and a little yiddish so i esked yaphank benneh what it was a toot



  coj

yaphank benneh explanationed
izzy kaplans kolumn



     - a toot is a feller which he would tell you to bet your money on a horse which
he aint got a chance said benneh  i hope you would stick close by me izzy
and not let any of them fellers toot you off like they done a friend of mine who
wouldnt listen to me and i gave him a hundred-to-one shoot and it came in all right
but he listened to the toot and he didnt have nothing down on it at all

    then i esked him to explanation to me what it was a hundred-to-one shoot and
if a feller should carry a gun to the treck with him benneh explanationed that -when
you was inwesting on a hundred-and-one shot if you put ten dollars in a enwelope
the feller which he is writing the books for the
racing trecks would give you your ten dollars
beck and a thousand dollars more besides

of course that got me interested right away
on account it looked like a fine inwestment for a
feller to make and i am always looking for a
good inwestment so i told benneh that when

they were shooting any horse for
a hundred to one he should tell
me about it quick on account 
could make the inwestment be-
fore some other feller got in
ahead of me

                                                benneh is wery well ac-
quainted about the treck so he went around whispering with a lot of fellers every-
body is whispering and nobody would talk out loud on account maybe it would wake
up the horses pretty soon benneh came to me and told it to me that a horse by the
name annie rooney would be a cinch in the second race on account he was talking to a
personal friend from the horse or maybe it was the feller who owns the horse

      izzy he told me  that horse is going to walk in

    right away quick i told him beck  then i wouldnt inwest my money on it
on account i dont want no horse that would walk i want a horse which she should
have her mind on the race and keep running even when winning on account you
couldnt win by too much if you wouldnt win it dont metter how little you lose by

    then i told yaphank benneh he should take ten dollars to the feller which he
is collectioning the inwestments the feller gives him a ticket which it reads annie
rooney is only twenty to one i made a holler on account i wanted she should be a
hundred to one but yaphank benneh told me that if a new beginner started in win-
ning a thousand dollars the first time he made it an inwestment the fellers which is
writing the books might get scared off and go into benkruptsy and it would be bad
for the game which it was a fine game and the sport of the kinks

    so anyhow i told him that two hundred dollars for ten was not so bad and i
esked him how long it was going on on account if people would hear it was so easy you
wouldnt be able to keep the customers out

     pretty soon there is a parade from the horses and a feller is blowing a horn and


argosy-allstory weekly

everybody is stending up and looking at them i am hoping that everybody doesnt
know that annie rooney is going to win on account somebody might do her some-
thing and spoil the race the feller which is riding annie rooney is a bleck feller
with a red and green shirt which would cost you about tweluf dollars even you got it

wholesale in grand street

     somebody said  theyre off and the horses started to move away all except-
ing one of them i was looking at them to see where it was annie rooney but none

of the fellers was wearing red and green then i looked beck and annie rooney
aint started yet i am thinking maybe that she didnt hear the signals on account
maybe she had trouble with her ears and that they would tell the other fellers to
come beck so that annie rooney would get another chance to commence starting

    but the horses kept moving along and everybody is hollering and nobody is
paying no attention to annie rooney when she commences to start she is moving
wery slow like she aint got no interest in the race at all and i didnt think the feller
which he was riding her knew that i had my ten dollars inwested maybe yaphank
benneh forgot to mention it to him

     i dont know what it is the name of the horse which it wins the race but his
number is number ten nobody could pronounce the names which they are nam-
ing those horses with anyhow the names is stranger than the names they got for
mr pullmansteins sleeping cars which has got the upstairs and downstairs apart-
ments about the same size as the apartments which they are renting them in the
bronix for fifty dollars a month and you got to sign it a lease that you will sleep in
them for two years

    when the other horses came in i esked yaphank benneh  what is the metter
did something delay annie rooney in the race

      she was left at the post benneh says  otherwise she would walk in
aint there a lot of carelessness around the racing treck i esked him that
they should leave a horse by the post when a feller has his money inwested what
kind of a business is it where they would forget to take a horse away from the post
when it is important

      izzy benneh told me  it happens some time to the best of them

     right away i got it a fine ideer but i didnt told it to yaphank benneh on
account ideers is worth money if you would take them to the right people and i am
taking this ideer to the feller which owns it the racing treck the ideer is this
they shouldnt have no more posts and then the horses wouldnt be left by them

    i told benneh that i wouldnt inwest no more money unless he would get the
feller which was riding the horse to tie a string around his finger so that he wouldnt
forget and leave his horse by the post then benneh got sore and told me i was a
piker and that i never appreciationed all the good things he was getting for me and

i	told him right beck that chon d rockerstein himseluf didnt have enough benk
roll to stand the good things which benneh was getting and also i said his informa-
tion was bum even he did get it from the feed box so one word led to another till
finally he poked me in the eye so that i am suing him for demeges also to get beck
the inwestment which he was swindling me out from

     it is my opinion yaphank benneh is a toot and was tooting me all the time

next week izzy kaplan will comment upon the price of a pass

  this man offers no such bromides as setting-up
exercises deep-breathing or any of those things you
know at the outset youll never do he uses a prin-
ciple that is the foundation of all chiropractic naprap-
athy mechano-therapy and even osteopathy only
he does not touch a hand to you it isnt necessary

  the reader will grant hradstreets method of staying
young worth knowing and using when told that its
originator whose photograph reproduced here was
taken a mouth ago is sixty-live years old

  and here is the secret me keeps his spine a half-
inch longer than it ordinarily zcould measure

  any matt or woman who thinks just one-half inch
elongation of the spinal column doesnt make a differ-
ence shi uld try it it is easy enough ill tell you
how first though you may be curious to learn
why a full-length spine puts one in an entirely new
class physically the spinal column is a series of
tiny bones between which are pads or cushions of
cartilage nothing in the ordinary activities of us
humans stretches the spine so it settles day by
day until those once soft and resilient pads become
thin as a safety-raior blade-and just about as hard
ones spine the most wonderfully designed shock-
absorber known is then an unyielding column that
transmits every shock straight to the base of the brain

  do you wonder folks have backaches and headaches
that ones nerves pound toward the end of a hard
day or that a nervous system may periodically go
to pieces for every nerve in ones body connects
with the spine which is a sort of central switchboard

knrnlihnn  rif	anti

 ana tcerc is iruuuic uu me nut

 now for proof that sublaxation of the spine causes
 st of the ills and ailments which spell age in

when the insulation or cartilage wears-down and
fiattens-out the nerves are exposed or even impinged
-and there is trouble on the line

  now

most - - --------------- 	

men or women flex your spine-shake it out -
and they will disappear you feel the difference in
ten minutes at least i did its no trick to secure
complete spinal laxation as bradstreet does it but
like everything else one must know how no amount
of violent exercise will do it not even chopping wood

as for walking or golring your spine settles down
a hit firmer with each step

  mr bradstreet has evolved from his -year experi-
ence with spinal mechanics a simple boiled-down for-
mula of just five movements neither takes more than
one minute so it means but five minutes a day but
those movements i never experienced such compound
exhilaration before i was a good subject for the
test for i went into it with a dull headache at the
end of the sccond movement i thought i could actually
feel my blood circulating the third movement in this
remarkable spive-motioh series brought an amazing
feeling of exhilaration one motion seemed to open
and shut my backbone like a jack-knife

  i asked about constipation he gave me another
motion-a peculiar writhing and twisting movement-
and fifteen minutes later came a complete evacuation

  hobart bradstreet frankly gives the full credit for
bis conspicuous success to these simple secrets of
spixe-motiov he has traveled about for years con-
ditioning those whose means permitted a specialitt at
their beck and call i met him at the roycroft inn at
eat aurora incidentally the late elbert hubbard
and be were great pals be was often the frav address

hobart bradstreet the man who declines to gbow old

guest in times past but bradstreet young as he looks
and feels thinks he has chased around the country
long enough he has been prevailed upon to put his
spixe-motion- method in form that makes it now
generally available

   i know vliat these remarkable mechanics of the
spine have done for me i have checked up at least
twenty-live other cases with all sincerity i say noth-
ing in the whole realm of medicine or specialism can
quicker re-muke rejuvenate and restore one i wish
vou could see bradstreet himself he is arrogantly
healthy he doesnt seem to have any nerves yet
he puffs incessantly at a black cigar that would floor
some men drinks two cups of coffee at every meal
and i dont believe he averages seven hours sleep
it shows what a sound nerve-mechanism will do he
says a man s power can and should be unabated tip to
the age of  in every sense and i have had some
astonishing testimony on that score

 would you like to try this remarkable method of
coming back or if young and apparently normal
in your action and feelings do you want to see your
energies just about doubled it is easy no ap-
paratus is required just bradstreets few simple
instructions made doubly clear by his photographic
poses of the five positions results come amazingly
quick in less than a week vou have new health
new appetite new desire and new capacities youll
feel years lifted off mind and body this miracle-
mans method can he tested without risk if you feel
enormously benefited everything is yours to keep and
vou have paid for it all the enormous sum of 
knowing something of the fees this man has been
accustomed to receiving i hope his naming  to
the general public will have full appreciation

the  which pays for everything is not sent in
advance unless you prefer just pay the postman who
brings it requests will be answered in turn try
how it feels to have a full-length spine and youll
henceforth pity men and women whose nerves are in
a vise

 hair and give it renewed
 vigor simply apply it to
 the scalp and hair and soon

 ing to give your hair its
 former luxuriance and
 beauty and note that the
 one preparation is for all
 colors of hair no special
