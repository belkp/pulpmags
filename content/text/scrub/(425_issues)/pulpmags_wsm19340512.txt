outlaws of
   calico hole

 by frank richardson pierce

 author of patriarch of the peaks etc

chapter i

over the wall

a ghost of a man whose
wasted face was the color
of old cheese dismounted
at calico springs drank
briefly from the cool wa-
ter then trudged up the path to the
ford ranch house

  hello he called hey alice
alice ford his shouting ended in
a violent fit of coughing

a slim girl with blond hair and

tragic eyes under startling darlc
brows came hurriedly to the door
and stared briefly her expression
indicated she was prepared for al-
most anything living near calico
hole the hang-out of the sanchez
outlaws had taught her to expect
wounded and often dying men but
this creature whose face was the
color of old cheese dismayed her

  come in she invited why
its bud coe

  whats left of him coe said
hoarsely a year in beasleys jails


street  smiths western story magazine

done this to me-a year bein held
for trial for a crime i never commit-
ted a year in a cell so damp the
walls sweat did you ever see stone
walls sweat

 alice ford shuddered perhaps
her twin brother al now looked like
coe a had been held for months
in beasleys jail again and again
his case had been set for trial only
to be mysteriously postponed

 tell me the truth bud alice
suddenly insisted how is al
have you seen him

 you fords have always faced the
music alice so im giving it to you
straight als a pretty sick boy
hes twenty years old and they say
he looks forty thats why im
here dan stuart als cell mate
heard they was turnin me loose so
he sneaked me this note beasley
wont stand for prisoners talkin
among theirselves

 alice ford unfolded a small
square of soiled paper and read

  dear miss ford

    please be a quarter of a mile north
  of the jail farm friday night nine
  oclock bring another girl with you
  also one span of fast horses hitched
  to a buckboard also two good saddle
  horses hide in that willow thicket
  and no matter what happens dont
  leave the thicket until i tell you to

the note was unsigned as
naturally a man contemplat-
ing a jail break was not likely
to identify himself if it could be
avoided the girl studied the hand-
writing with interest something
in the bold strokes suggested the
note had ibeen written by a man ac-
customed to planning as well as com-
plete obedience it was not diffi-
cult to imagine him smashing
through all opposition regardless of
cost until he had attained the goal
-a good friend and a good enemy
too and he was asking her to as-

sist in a jail break-a crime in it-
self he must know something of
her and have readied the conclusion
she would stop at nothing to free
al the need of a buckboard an-
other girl and two saddle horses
indicated stuart was bringing an-
other with him so that man must
be her brother

  what sort of man is he bud
alice asked

  i saw ihim a lot he was never
still always moving when in the
yard for exercise he made me
think of a tiger-always restraining
his fury hes got more self-control
than any man i ever saw and he
had plenty of chance to use it hes
one man beasley cant seem to

break and yet-

  yes she said quickly

  it seemed as if he began to crack
around the edges after they put him
in als cell answered bud coe

  whats he in jail for alice
asked

  he tried to rob the bank at
wagon gap an odd expression
appeared on coes face as he spoke

  the fool alice exclaimed
thats never been done even
sanchez wont try that

  dan stuart tackled it hes tack-
ling a jail break too coe jerked
his head toward the lower country
where beasleys jail stood and
thats never been done either
well ill mosey along

  were you acquitted of that cat-
tle-rustling charge alice asked

  he bowed his head the gesture
of a beaten man i never rustled
them cows he said and i never
had a chance to prove it in court
theyd keep postponin the trial
ive got a wife and kids to think of
so when they said theyd drop
charges if id get out of the country
i said id light out
outlaws of calico hole



  and leave behind a ranch youve
worked years on alice said

  yes he said leave it to who-
ever is tryin to grab the finest
range in texas but a man can
stand seein hisself in a damp cell
slowly changin to a mummy for
just about so long

  i dont blame you bud alice
replied life is sweet if i can get
al away from that jail and keep
him from returning to the sanchez
crowd then ill gladly ride away and
leave calico springs to whoever it
is that is trying to grab the coun-
try yes ill go much as i detest
quitting this range quitting is
hateful to me but twins are closer
than many brothers and sisters al
is all i have in the world he comes
first she smiled sympathetically
at the other good luck bud
thanks and plenty of the same
to you coe replied he was think-
ing she would need luck if al es-
caped not only the jail but return-
ing to sanchezs gang and above
all escaped the price dan stuart
would ask for aiding him in the jail
break gradually the conviction
had grown on coe that stuart was
not one who did things for nothing
perhaps it was this feeling which
prompted him to turn and say
this stuart claims to have fallen
in love with your picture alice
the girls smooth cheeks flushed
with resentment there was a defi-
nite tightening around her jaw

  he talked about me among those
prisoners she gasped

  nothing as bad as that-he just
mooned a lot over your picture ac-
cordin to al coe answered

lice ford studied the note
again thinking she might
- - read between the lines two
horses hitched to a buckboard she
reflected two saddles horses and

an extra girl well theres only one
girl i could or should ask to take
the risk-sally geary she loves
al enough to go through with it
and not back down if we run into
a streak of bad luck

  thursday morning alice selected
the finest horses on the ranch for
her purpose hitched two to the
buckboard tied the others behind
then loaded canteens and saddles
onto the buckboard she arrived at
chris gearys little ranch at noon

  a girl as slim and graceful as al-
ice hurried from the house the
sunlight flashed from her dark-red
hair and her full lips curved in a
happy smile there was a gleam of
even white teeth

  shes beautiful alice thought
and shell make al a grand little
wife-putting on the brakes when
hes in a reckless mood patting him
on the back when he needs it she
sighed if we can only get them
out of the country

  the two girls kissed and stood
looking at each other with sympa-
thetic understanding

  its been so long since weve seen
him sally said wistfully

  yes but read this alice an-
swered extending the note its
from dan stuart who wants to help
al escape

 why sally demanded why
does he want to help al im sus-
picious strangers who do favors
often have an ax to grind she
read the note through twice of
course im the other girl she
glanced at a pasture where a bulky
man was working dadll give me
a hiding if he ever hears i helped
al or anybody to break jail but im
eighteen and i know my own mind
eighteen seems to be very old to
any one who is eighteen or younger

  ill explain im taking two horses
to town alice suggested and in-


street  smiths western story magazine

vite you to go along your father
wont object to that

  no sally answered hell do
anything for me except consent to
me marrying al als got to mend
his ways and settle down he says
hes never forgotten he threw in
with sanchez

  hes through with sanchez and
all the rest alice said grimly he
lives for us from now on youll go
with us anywhere and help make a
new start sally

  anywhere the- red-haired girl
answered quietly

  chris geary genial and hard-
working climbed a fence and hailed
them thus preventing further dis-
cussion of jail breaks and future
plans alice smiled and said

  i want sally to go to town with
me well leave to-morrow morn-
ing and be back saturday how
about it

  sure chris agreed good-hu-
moredly providin shell bring me
back some tobacco sallys got
dinner rassled up and we can find
an extra plate somewheres alice so
youd better light and sit

  the two girls found time to go
into details that afternoon and eve-
ning everything was settled-al-
ice and al would leave calico
springs and notify sally when they
located the latter would ship their
belongings arrange for trusted men
to drive their horses and cattle from
the valley and later join them

  they left the extra horses outside
of town shopped about and de-
parted at dusk shortly after dark-
ness fell they picked up the two
horses and quietly made their way
to the appointed place in front of
them lay the broad acres of the jail
farm behind them lay a stretch
of hard ground then a dusty road
the railway track lay just beyond

the road the station and town
proper were a mile east of the jail

  a cricket sang in the thicket
where the two girls watched and
from somewhere came the musical
murmur of a creek flowing over
stones overhead the stars with
gleaming spearheads at their points
hung low an eternity passed while
the girls strained their eyes at the
dark mass which marked the jail
here and there a faint light gleamed
from the dismal structure but even
the lights suggested musty cells

sallys voice broke the silence
alice im afraid she whis-
pered not for myself but
for al dad once told me those
guards are armed with sawed-off
shotguns and - rifles

  sh-h alice placed a comfort-
ing hand on the other girls shoul-
der-a shoulder that was trembling
death in action is better than
death by inches in that hell of beas-
leys

  why dont they kick him out
sally demanded

  he is too strong politically al-
ice answered whispers were better
than the horrible silence and their
thoughts as they waited

  why doesnt jud tremper or
some of the texas rangers go after
beasley sally suggested theyve
rounded up and branded a number
of crooked politicians in the past
jud tremper alice fords
voice was freighted with scorn jud
tremper rated the greatest
ranger in our time and what does
lie do ill tell you when some-
body suggested he arrest sanchez
he lost his health overnight and
went to cuba or some place to rest
and sanchez killed trempers own
brother bah

  the shriek of a locomotive whis-
outlaws of calico hole



tie rasped the girls tense nerves
sally jumped and cried out
easy alice warned

  silence fell again they heard
the train stop then the clank and
rattle of empty cattle cars as it
started up again but no sound
came from the grim walls

  when will we know sally
asked

  when two stealthy figures come
out of the darkness i hope alice

replied an uproar will mean-

  orange flame stabbed the dark-
ness and the heavy report of a shot-
gun sounded above the noise of the
train flame stabbed twice on the
right then on the left in the ap-
proximate vicinity of the jail a
mans scream sudden and sharp
made the night hideous

  sally leaped to her feet

im going out there she cried
so am i alice answered then
checked the impulse no dan
stuarts orders were to leave this
place under no circumstances
darn dan stuart sally
snapped as alice pulled her down
maybe als hit and needs us
alice was almost crying and her
calmness was willed the jail siren
began to moan woo-oo woo-oo
woo-oo the signal of an escape
rifle fire swept the darkness bul-
lets droned through the thicket
clipping off twigs and leaves

  down alice warned those

bullets are-

  i see something sally cried
look a big man carrying-al
the big man staggered to the
thicket he had raced all the way
from the jail wall carrying a heavy
burden

  miss ford he panted drive
-buckboard-onto road als not
hurt i screamed to make em think
one of us-hit

  come sally alice directed as

she ran to the buckboard dan
stuarts voice was deep even thrill-
ing but something in it made her
jump the quickening of her pulse
was due more to some strange re-
sponse to his presence than to ex-
citement

  she drove the buckboard to the
road and stopped the horses the
big man placed al on the seat then
pulled off his shoes

  put them on over your shoes
he ordered sally he jumped to
the buckboard then pulled off his
own shoes these he gave to alice
put them on please then cross the
road after we drive by be sure to
step in our wheel tracks i want
beasleys posse to conclude the
buckboard has nothing to do with
our escape

  i understand alice replied

  then the two of you climb the
fence and scramble up the roadbed
leaving plenty of shoe tracks once
youre up there one of you take off
a shoe and thrust it under a rail as
if it had been caught throw the
others into an empty car as that
freight passes walk along the right
of way keeping to the ties for some
distance then cross back to the road
and to your horses as dan stu-
art finished his concise instructions
he cracked the whip and the buck-
board vanished

  he had everything planned al-
ice said even to timing the break
to the passing of this freight train
beasleys posse will follow the
tracks find the shoe caught under
the rail and conclude dan and al
are on the train in the meantime
theyll be driving like all possessed
for calico springs come

  the two girls obeyed instructions
to the letter crouched several hun-
dred yards down the track from the
point they had left the shoe then
as the freight thundered past threw


street  smiths western story magazine

the three remaining shoes into an
empty car they made their way
to the horses mounted and rode off
in the opposite direction skirting
the town to avoid possible question-
ing then doubling iback and taking
the calico springs road

chapter ii

at calico springs

when alice and sally ar-
rived at the geary ranch
the latter looked briefly at
her home then shook her head i
havent seen al except a glimpse in
the dark she said im going on
with you alice therell be plans
to make of course

  and very little time to make
them alice suggested the posse
will search the freight train find
nothing then start for calico
springs what is done must be fin-
ished before the posse shows up
the girls rode on and day was
breaking over the calico ridge as
they reached the springs the ridge
with its sheer walls was a riot of
yellows blues tans and greens
the ranch nestled snugly against the
ridge

  its so beautiful here sally ex-
claimed and it just makes me sick
to think you must leave it all
yes alice answered but
what can we do our cattle are
taken to get them back al threw
in with sanchez and now the law
claims hes a rustler if we stay
its a return to jail for al and that
means his death and yet-she
looked at the rolling country with
its rich range land-and yet five
generations of fords have lived here
when i leave something will be
torn from my heart by the roots
they dismounted at the ranch
and a shy indian boy ran to take
the horses

  has anybody been here jose
alice asked al and a stranger

  the boy looked startled at the
mention of ats name but shook his
head

  nobody he said

  the day dragged a day of watch-
ing for dust movements in the lower
country

  where can they be sally asked
in a desperate voice

  following iback roads so theyll
not be seen alice suggested als
experience with sanchez taught him
to be elusive

  joses mother was preparing the
evening meal when they heard the
clatter of hoofs then the horses
gray with lather and dust dragged
the battered buckboard into the
yard again alice ford was con-
scious of dan stuarts instinctive
leadership the bank robber domi-
nated the scene as his big figure
leaped to the ground but neverthe-
less she could not take her eyes from
her twin brother

 normally he weighed around a
hundred and seventy pounds now
he was under a hundred and thirty
his cheek bones were covered with
skin the color of parchment so
tightly drawn it seemed as if the
bones must burst through his eyes
were deeply sunken and his hands
were like claws

  sis he whispered and sally

  he threw his arms about them
and their loving arms lifted him to
the ground

  then it was the girls burst into
tears

 poor boy poor boy sally
sobbed theyve crucified you
why

  if id died i wouldnt have been
the first-and all because somebody
wants the country al answered
i thought a lot but couldnt figure
the answer though beasleys part
outlaws of calico hole



of it we havent got long here
he glanced about apprehensively
then his wasted lips bared in a
smile it was like the grin of a skull
the old place looks good and you
look good

  wherere you going alice
asked

  the only place im safe al re-
plied to pedro sanchez in calico
hole

  alice ford caught her breath as
though in distress at that but she
could not bring herself to argue just
yet with her brother

  were forgetting dan al said
he introduced the big fellow the
best friend a man ever had alice
and i want you to like him

dan stuarts blue eyes
were smiling and there was
warmth on his rugged fea-
tures and something more-an in-
terest in alice the girl found dis-
turbing but behind it all she
sensed this man was driving himself
or being driven over a well-blazed
trail and nothing could turn him
aside

  beasley said they had a special
hell for cattle rustlers and bank rob-
bers al said and proved it didnt
he dan

  he tried to dan answered his
black curly hair needed trimming
and there was heavy black stubble
on his cheeks his jaw fell just
short of being downright stubborn
much of the tan remained on his
skin but already there was a touch
of als horrible yellow on the tan

  supper is ready the indian
woman said i take care of horses
jose run down road and watch if
anybody come

  come on alice invited

  just a second al pleaded the
air feels so good to my lungs and i
like to see good range countiy in-

stead of sweating walls queer but
the light hurts my eyes queer-

  come on al sally pleaded
she could not stand the expression
on his face it made her want to
kill beasley and his ilk

  the girls ate more than the men
prison-fed stomachs had shrunk and
al had difficulty in retaining good
food nothing was said until they
had finished the meal then alice
said

  every minute counts so lets
plan for the future well have to
give up the ranch

  like hell we will al ford said
thatd be playing into their hands
like-hell a fit of coughing
ended his protest

  alice turned to dan stuart whose
eyes had not left her during the
meal

  what are your plans mr stu-
art she asked

  my plans dan stuart said
ill throw in with sanchez if hell
let me i need ten thousand dollars
to develop a ranch i have in mind
and thats the quickest way to get
it he smiled a warm pulse-
quickening smile a girl would have
found attractive under different con-
ditions

  why not go with al and me and
make a new start alice suggested
you cant beat this game

  sanchez seems to be beating the
game- dan began

  al cut in has sanchez been
bothering you alice he asked
has he been wanting to marry
you the deeply sunken eyes
were probing and held something of
pain

  he hasnt been annoying me-
much the girl answered

  sanchez seems to be beating the
game dan repeated

  youve got to admit that al
said jud tremper got one-eyed


street  smiths western story magazine

dravus spike fortune and apache
grimm but when they mentioned
sanchez tremper went away on a
vacation

  and thats hard to believe stu-
art observed

  oh i dont know al said
the man enjoys life as well as the
next one have you heard the story
of sanchezs initials

  lets have it stuart suggested
glancing out of the window at the
watchful jose

  his initials are p and s al ex-
plained and the p is formed by
the graves of five deputy sheriffs
there had to be a period after the
initial and so a sixth deputy was
buried standing up the s is formed
by the graves of three texas rang-
ers who tried to sneak into calico
hole and take him alive and two
sheriffs

  how about the period dan
asked

  hes got the grave dug al in-
formed him and hes going to bury
jud tremper in the grave can
you blame tremper for taking a va-
cation

  all eyes were on stuart interested
in his reactions to this gruesome ar-
rangement of initials

  yes i blame tremper stuart
said ive heard one of the rangers
was his brother a brave man
would never let up until he squared
accounts but whats that got to
do with me

  sanchez owes his safety to his
caution in picking members of his
band al explained if hes sus-
picious of anybody who comes into
calico hole he plays safe and kills
the man if you did get by sanchez
then youd have to quiet el mudos
suspicions el mudo means the
dumb in the mexican language
this deaf-and-dumb man has a sixth

sense which seems to warn him of
danger

  and he exercises a strange influ-
ence over sanchez alice said
the creature gives me the creeps
i think ill take a chance stu-
art announced theres an outfit
that interests me

  and that being the case dan
al said i string with you

  al both girls spoke in uni-
son not that again-not sanchez
an outlaws life and the end-the
rope or jail

  the intense loyalty alice ford
had feared might control her brother
was now evident

  look at me he said im
nearly dead id have died but for
dan i owe my life to him and
its his for the asking its a debt
ill never forget to repay

  alice was to remember his simply
declared promise in tragic days to
come

  forget it al stuart urged
you owe me nothing youd bet-
ter take your sisters advice and pull
out-make a new start somewhere
no dan im stringing with
you al insisted nobody can
stop me when youre in the clear
then ill pick up where ive left off
al sally pleaded dont i mean
a thing to you

  everything in the world sally
al quickly assured her but im
stringing with dan

alice knowing her brother
had resolved to go through

	with it turned to dan stu-
art if as she had heard this man
had fallen in love with her photo-
graph during his lonely hours per-
haps she might influence him it
was a pretty and rather convincing
picture she painted of the four of
them making a new start and she

ws-b
outlaws of calico hole



saw his eyes light at the prospect
but invariably the inexorable some-
thing which dominated the man re-
turned

  ill need ten thousand to develop
the place i have in mind he said
and ive decided to string with
sanchez if hell let me

  as dan stuart finished speaking
he suddenly jumped to his feet

  jose is coming on the dead run
he cried

  they met the native boy at the
door and from his mixture of mexi-
can indian and english understood
a large number of men were closing
in on them he had seen them in
the half light of fading day in the
lower country

  jose followed by his mother dis-
appeared toward the bam and in
an amazingly brief time returned
with fresh horses saddled alice
aided her brother in mounting and
as he galloped away pressed a rifle
into dans ready hand

  its loaded she called and
more ammunition in the saddlebags
let the horse have its head-it
knows the way to calico hole

  at the turn in the road dan
looked back she was standing de-
jectedly on the porch lighted by
the lamp held in the indian wom-
ans hand

  dan cradled the rifle in the crook
of his arm and let the horse have
its head they raised good horses
on the ford ranch he thought his
own animal was sure-footed and
filled with fire in ten minutes time
the west wall of the valley vaulted
to the very stars he looked back
and saw sparks fly a quarter of a
mile below where a horses shoe had
struck flint it was just a flash but
as it was repeated several times he
knew the posse was riding direct to
the portals of calico hole

 ws-b

  theyre heading us off al called
back

  keep going and ill open up with
the rifle dan answered he dis-
mounted moved several yards from
his horse and hastily fired then
jumped back to the animal again
a withering blast centered on the
point where his rifle had flashed
then he heard the thud of boots
striking rocks the posse was dis-
mounting and taking to cover

  again mounting dan closed in
behind al who had pulled up sev-
eral minutes later they rode un-
challenged through a canyon less
than a hundred feet in width the
walls on either side reared at least
a thousand feet before falling back
to even higher walls

  we camp here for to-night al
said pulling up his horse

  in the starlight dan could make
out the dim outlines of a cleared
area two hundred feet long and a
hundred feet wide a trickle of fall-
ing water came faintly and he heard
the hiss of a breeze running through
dry grass

  well picket the nags al said
then turn in theres a shack
against the wall and it has several
bunks

  how about the posse

  there isnt a man among them
thatd come in here for a thousand
dollars al said they dont know
what theyre up against and wont
take chances

  what are we up against
plenty of barbed-wire fence
strung across the gap a hundred
rods up the trail al explained
behind the barbed wire is a man
or two with a winchester rifle its
been a long day and ive managed
to pull through thanks to you
dan he dragged the saddle from
his horse and staggered into the
cabin where he fell into a bunk


street  smiths western story magazine

filled with straw and was soon snor-
ing

  sleep did not come so readily to
dan stuart what sort of a recep-
tion awaited him and what of
el mudo could he really read
character or did he accept or con-
demn a man according to the mood
of the moment well he con-
cluded theres more chance inside
the hole than out

  the next thing dan knew it was
daylight and the bright sun was
bringing out the details of each col-
ored rock and ledge he followed
the sun line as it worked down into
the hole and presently the golden
flood spilled over a slope and there
sharply defined lay the curiously
placed graves of eleven sheriffs and
rangers even at this distance it
was possible to recognize the grue-
some letters of pedro sanchezs ini-
tials there was the p composed
of six graves the s of five graves
and the round empty grave await-
ing jud tremper which would serve
as a period

chapter iii

bury him alive

dan stuart walked about
the barbed wire which was
strung across the entrance
to the main part of calico hole and
eyed it curiously no horse could
make its way through there after
dark though a twisting lane was
available for use by day a rifle
commanding both the barbed wire
and the split in the walls lay on a
ledge two hundred yards away
above the rifle dan saw a dark
head outlaws were on guard

  that fellow wont come down
a explained nodding at the guard
its his business to stay up there
we can drift through but return-
ing would be something else im

worried about you i had hoped to
later talk you out of your plan but
the posse forced things

  howre you feeling al

  fine why shouldnt i im
free he answered but dan knew
that he was trying to deceive him
al was a sick youth and it would
require more than freedom to cure
him though that would help al
required good food rest and care
theres no turning back now he
went on so we might as well get
it over with

  dan saddled the horses and al
led the way through the barbed
wire the guard recognizing the
younger man shouted something
and al waved back

  near the slope bearing sanchezs
initials dan pulled up the graves
dug at curious angles to form the
letters were whitewashed around
the mounds the grass was permitted
to grow and the contrast between
white and green was marked

  the beat of hoofs came suddenly
and al ford whirled in the saddle
his sallow face turned gray with
fear and he groaned

  its alice

  fresh and vivid and perhaps a
little excited alice ford rode up on
a mare that stepped daintily and
held its head high

  dont scold me al the girl
pleaded before her brother could
speak

  you shouldnt have come into
the hole he groaned you
shouldnt you know it means you
can never leave pedro sanchez will
always be around with his unwel-
come attentions

  i thought of that but its not
important the girl insisted
youre all ive got al and you
need nursing you are sick youve
been going on your nerve for hours
now and when youre really back
outlaws of calico hole



with sanchezs band therell be a
reaction

  im not worth it he muttered
if id have thought youd come
into this place id have stayed in
beasleys jail

  dan saw that the younger man
was desperately worried he seemed
about to go to pieces

the girl looked up at the graves
so thats the slope with san-
chezs initials she said and a shud-
der ran through her slender body
oh the beast

  just a minute alice her
brother admonished outside of
calcio hole it was all well enough
to say what you thought but in-
side its well to keep your opinions
to yourself specially about san-
chez

  i suppose so the girl mur-
mured her eyes on the initials but
im thinking id rather be jud
tremper dead and buried standing
in that grave than jud tremper on
a vacation with every outlaw know-
ing sanchez had sent him a chal-
lenge

  trempers no fool he knows its
suicide to stick his nose into the
hole unless he has a hundred texas
rangers with him al answered
come on dan youve got to face
the music

they rode around a shoulder
of rock and the outlaw hang-
out lay a quarter of a mile
ahead of them thirty or forty of
the finest horses dan had ever seen
grazed in a pasture through which
ran a small stream bordered by
trees the stream began high in
the calico ridges dropped two thou-
sand feet down a red wall and
spread over the canyon

  several acres of rich blade bot-
tom land were under cultivation
and dan observed both beef and

dairy stock in fenced-of grass areas
sanchezs outlaws lived well

  those horses are the pick of ev-
ery raid hes ever made on the fin-
est stock in the southwest al said
nothing any posse has can match
them for speed even the twin f
which is what we call our ranch
cant match them

  they turned toward a group of
cabins set on a low ridge which com-
manded the hole an adobe build-
ing housed several men while ad-
joining cabins were undoubtedly
used for storing supplies the larg-
est building was a two-story log
cabin of recent construction it
contained large windows and a
broad piazza it had been built
among several shade trees and was
therefore cool the year around

  sanchezs place al said briefly
and thats where we report

  as they dismounted several men
came from the adobe and welcomed
al as an old friend at the same
time they looked on alice with ap-
proval and dan stuart with suspi-
cion

  wheres sanchez al asked
ah my friend cried a voice
and my friends sister

  hello sanchez al ford cried
we got here by the skin of our
teeth beasleys men were right on
our heels this is dan stuart he
got me out of jail

  dan stuart im disappointed
sanchez said with an eloquent ges-
ture i had hoped it might be jud
tremper come to accept my poor
hospitality but tremper is an
older man you stuart are how
old

  twenty-five dan answered
aware that the outlaws genial man-
ner was a pose and that he was
suspicious of the whole business a
dozen men had congregated about
them and at some time or other


street  smiths western story magazine

dan had seen every face on notices
offering rewards for wanted men

  to a man they were a lean hard
lot with hands amazingly swift and
graceful in the handling of ropes and
guns with eyes which betrayed
nothing but suspicion and caution
and with legs slightly bowed from
a lifetime brief as some of their
spans might be in the saddle

  you are young sanchez ob-
served yet old for one who follows
a dangerous life or has your life
been dangerous as the outlaw
leader put the query a stocky man
came from the cabin walked to a
position behind sanchez and
stopped sanchez turned so that
the man might watch his lips then
he said you are just in time el
mudo

  el mudos arrival quickened the
interest of those gathered about it
looked as if they might have an en-
tertaining morning should the dumb
one decide dan stuart was either
dangerous to their well-being or
lacked sufficient courage to be in-
cluded as one of their number-

lice ford was watching el
- mudo as a bird might watch
a snake al sick and ex-
hausted from the previous days
hardships sank into the nearest
chair

  here were gathered two of the
most desperate characters in the
southwest and they were working
together the girl was thinking
and dan stuart was thinking al
had not found words to convey the
terrible penetrating force behind el
mudos mental probings the dumb
ones eyes never left dans face
dans eyes were blue and sometimes
there was frost in their depths but
el mudos were something colder
than ice they were hard glitter-
ing and did not blink or waver

the lids appeared to be glued to the
skull

 his shoulders were thick and
bowed across the back his chest was
deep el mudos short powerful
arms could literally have torn a
man apart he was unarmed save
for a belt containing seven knives
his breed relied on knives and dark-
ness rather than guns for offense
and defense the mans hair was
the color of rotting straw which in
itself was unpleasant but it was his
finger nails which caused alice to
recoil the fingers were short
thick and filthy the nails deeply
embedded half moons

 suddenly el mudos interest
switched from dan stuart to alice
ford he advanced a step and laid
his hand on her arm the fingers
dug into her firm flesh and were
withdrawn leaving round pink cra-
ters on her skin she started to
draw away contemptuously then re-
membered this creature might pre-
vent her from aiding als recovery
she remained passive her calmness
willed

  el mudo bared his teeth in a grin
they were yellow broken teeth pro-
truding from a thick jaw his lips
moved but no sound came except a
faint hiss and sometimes a whisper

  say that again sanchez or-
dered i didnt quite get it

  it was then dan realized both
men were lip readers and though no
words came from el mudos lips
nevertheless words were formed and
understood by sanchez el mudo
repeated his curious movements and
the outlaw leader smiled

  he says that youll do alice and
you can stay with us sanchez
swept off his hat and bowed low
calico hole has the most beautiful
outlaw in the southwest

  im here to care for al the girl
answered
outlaws of calico hole



  el mudo watched her lips and
saw the rapid pulsations on her
throat and he knew she was fright-
ened yet such was the love she bore
her brother she would never falter

  dan had been watching sanchez
until el mudo appeared after that
the dumb one dominated the scene
by sheer force of personality now
dan observed details in the outlaw
leaders dress and bearing

  sanchez was half white half in-
dian and was said to carry the
apache strain his cruelty lent this
legend a degree of truth his wolf-
ish body moved without effort his
black eyes roved incessantly as if
he constantly expected danger from
every source this was in marked
contrast to el mudos unblinking
gaze and solid figure sanchezs
coloring was like milk mixed with
ink the man had been educated
in a government school and now he
was mixing white mans education
with apache cunning and applying
it to cattle raids bank and train rob-
beries

sanchez called al ford to his
side with a brief nod of his
head take your sister to the
second cabin el mudo doesnt like
your friend what happens may
not be pleasing to a girls eyes he
said

  he got me out of jail al an-
swered in a low tone and risked
his neck to do it he shot a glance
at dan stuart erect and unafraid
you dont need to worry sanchez
hell never show the white feather
ive seen him under fire

  true some never show the
white feather texas rangers ive
watched three die he inclined his
head toward the slope but we
would not want them in our outfit
his face hardened take your sis-
ter and get out

  all right al agreed he walked
over to alice sanchez has given
us the second cabin i think ill
go to bed im sick

  as the girl disappeared el mudo
came within two feet of dan his
face twisted into a sudden snarl and
his lips formed the unmistakable
words texas ranger

  dont be too sure of that el
mudo dan retorted time might
prove you were wrong then youd
lose face and you cant afford to
lose face with sanchez

  he did not speak aloud merely
forming the words on his lips hop-
ing el mudo would understand
the dumb one understood and the
scowl between his eyes deepened
he turned to sanchez and his lips
moved so rapidly dan could not
catch what was being said sanchez
nodded

  come on jud tremper the
outlaw cried sharply and die
dont try to scare me sanchez
dan retorted i want to throw in
with your outfit or i wouldnt be
here do you think if i was afraid
of threats or death id come here
sanchez never bluffs tremper
the outlaw snarled

  dan shrugged his shoulders with
fine indifference

  i figured you might think i was
most anybody but tremper he
said youve never seen tremper
or you wouldnt make a crack of
that kind ive seen the ranger
he scowled into sanchezs face
ive robbed a bank under his nose
and got away with it now lets
get down to business do i string
with you or dont i

  el mudos eyes had never left
dans lips as he finished speak-
ing the man clawed at sanchezs
arm he was conveying his belief
the new arrival was a ranger in dis-


street  smiths western story magazine

guise and he was insisting that dan
die at once

that settles it tremper san-
chez said you die all right boys
the band surrounded dan in a
threatening ring one of the men
caught his arm

  we take our prisoners to the
grave on the hoof he jeered we
aint got dead wagons white horses
and such

  alice ford hearing the change in
tone came from the cabin

 what is wrong she cried
dont they believe you mr stu-
art before dan could reply she
turned to sanchez you must be-
lieve him he isnt a ranger hes
an-a wanted man she had al-
most used the word outlaw
dont worry dan interrupted
the boys got a little excited were
just talking things over tell al its
a little matter of proving im dan
stuart-er-ah-gentleman adven-
turer and not jud tremper

ft hie girl eyed him briefly no
man going to his death
could be so casual and she
returned to the cabin convinced
sanchezs eyes almost ceased their
incessant roving and centered on
dans face as he spoke if dan was
afraid he did not betray it

 take him down to the ceme-
tery sanchez ordered

 they plodded down the trail
which was partly concealed from
the cabins by a natural growth of
brush and trees they walked
stiffly in their high-heeled boots and
few words were spoken this man
every member of the band sensed
was different his coldness was the
deadly coldness of sanchez himself
but he lacked sanchezs high nerv-
ous tension some thought he might
be jud tremper but others were of
the opinion tremper would not walk

into calico hole it was unfortun-
ate indeed they decided that the
rangers name had come up other-
wise this calm young man might
even now be numbered among them

  crunch crunch the gravel
under their boots slipped and set-
tled only to be disturbed by the
next man crunch crunch
dan thought death death
the sound took on a new meaning
it suddenly occurred to him the men
about him believed he was to die
their exultation was deadened
partly by their curiosity toward his
careless manner he had faced
death before but it usually involved
gun play and when a man is hit-
ting back with fists or bullets he
hasnt time to think of himself and
death

  death death they turned
into a narrow path and walked in
single file to the slope he was go-
ing to die without a chance to hit
back the instant he raised his
hands other smooth and swift hands
would go for weapons and dust
would spurt from his clothing as
their bullets struck

  a tremor passed through his nerv-
ous system and his face changed
he knew some of the color drained
as if the heart had stopped beat-
ing el mudo informed sanchez

  hes afraid hes yellow soon
hell talk

  sanchez nodded in satisfaction
he never wanted to appear to be
in doubt before his men or in el
mudos presence he must always
be right el mudo held to the same
theory as long as he was right in
his conclusions men would fear and
obey him even sanchez the man
who gained the upper hand in a con-
flict with the pair would have to
outfox them in a clash of wits rather
than bullets

  on the ibrink of the hole that was
outlaws of calico hole



to serve as a period for the letter s
the party stopped the round grave
was four feet across and ten feet
deep with rocks and sand covering
the bottom

  get in sanchez ordered then
as dan leaped to the bottom he
tossed down a shovel shovel out
that loose stuff

  the men peered down grinning
and wondering as the man in the
grave tossed sand and small rocks
clear of the grave presently he was
down to hard dirt and the job was
done

  come out now sanchez or-
dered and make your dying state-
ment

  two men held a short length of
rope and grasping it dan hauled
himself out

  go ahead sanchez directed
and talk

  never mind how i got started
on my present trail dan said
nor is dan stuart my right name
who here is going under his right
name for that matter now get
this i put in some time in the prison
at yuma drifted across into new
mexico with some others after a jail
break and was in on the bank rob-
bery at madra

  four men shot by the cashier
sanchez said sharply

  one got away dan answered
then continued theres always
plenty of money in the bank at
wagon gap so i started to figure
a way of cleaning out that bank
i thought id give it a whirl single-
handed then if i couldnt turn the
trick id throw in with you
nobodys ever robbed that
bank sanchez briefly observed

  theres always a first time dan
insisted and i had a couple of
plans i picked the wrong one-i
didnt figure on the mob that would
take up the trail i got fifty thou-

sand dollars but couldnt get away
with it they threw me into jail
and you know the rest-i sawed my
way out and brought al ford with
me hes a good man and he was
dying

  youre a liar sanchez panted
you can look a man in the eyes
and lie youre tremper and youre
going to die he signaled el mudo
and the latter knocked dan to his
knees sanchez whipped out a 
the trigger was secured to the
guard and the weapon could be dis-
charged by merely drawing the ham-
mer back and letting it go

  sanchezs thumb crooked over the
trigger and the thumb nail grew red
from the pressure slowly the ham-
mer was drawn back and the men
almost stopped breathing

  go ahead dan did not speak
aloud but moved his lips knowing
the outlaw would understand go
ahead and get it over with then let
time prove you never made good
your boast to bury jud tremper in
that grave his lips twisted into
a sneer and i thought you and
el mudo were smart

  the thumb trembled and slowly
the hammer was released dan did
not move but a sigh swept through
the group

  if i was only sure if i was
only sure the outlaw whispered
what do you think el mudo
this too was a whisper but dan
heard and said

  hes told you im jud tremper
that settles it

  it does settle it sanchez
snapped

  his foot shot out and knocked
dan into the grave he got to his
feet awaiting the next turn in this
desperate game

  this one dies different the out-
law ordered bury him alive
and el mudo nodded

chapter iv

a pact

the men about the grave
picked up shovels and began
throwing in the dirt it
came down in a steady stream from
all sides the dust nearly suffocating
him he threw his arm across his
face and cursed the outlaw for be-
ing a fool until the dust started him
to coughing

 the dirt climbed higher and
higher to his knees then his thighs
and finally to his waist

 stop sanchez ordered he
peered curiously down while the
dust settled ready to talk he
asked

  not with you sanchez dan re-
torted id heard stories about you
and el mudo i thought you were
above the average i figured you
were smart enough to tell the differ-
ence between a ranger and some
poor devil trying to make an honest
living off the banks well im pay-
ing for my mistake in judgment witji
my life

  as sanchezs face hardened dan
heard als voice he was coughing
from the effort of running and he
almost hurled himself on the out-
law

  you cant do it sanchez he
panted he saved my life

  sanchezs fingers clenched and
his arms half lifted as if to throt-
tle al for his impudence perhaps
the outlaw leader was looking for a
way out possibly he was convinced
dan was not a ranger but a coura-
geous chap handy with a gun and
skilled in the art of helping himself
to a banks funds a change passed
over sanchezs face as he saw in al
ford an opportunity to work this
problem out along a different line

  youd like to live eh stuart

he queried youd like to join my
band eh

  id like to live dan snapped
but im not so sure about throw-
ing in with your outfit after whats
just happened

  sanchezs face flushed darkly he
felt himself on the defensive the
bank at wagon gap has never been
robbed you and the others have
picked up a few dollars and been
caught bring me fifty thousand
dollars from wagon gap and you
can throw in with us

  and youll go along too dan
countered

  the outlaw shook his head you
play a lone-hand game and show
pedro sanchez how good you are
my friend and if you dont come
back then-ill kill al ford eh
al

  hell come back with the loot

al declared confidently or-

he hesitated or hell die in his
tracks yes i hadnt thought of
that-therell be a hundred men
ready to take the trail theyll
cover the country

  ah but your friend is smart
sanchez sneered he has plans
that will be successful

  sure but ive got to have time
and do it in my own way dan de-
clared this means life or death
to me

  and to your friend al ford
sanchez softly suggested

 dan glanced at el mudo that
worthy had played a hunch and
made a bid for fame by declaring
this man was jud tremper come to
accept the outlaws challenge dans
sneers had changed his mind and
he was glad to take sanchezs way
out also

  two men dropped into the grave
and aided dan in freeing himself
he shook the dirt from his clothing
and wiped his face
outlaws of calico hole



  now lets get this straight he
said were making a pact im
to rob the wagon gap bank of at
least fifty thousand dollars and bring
it here if i double-cross you then
al dies

  yes sanchez said and if al
should go out and not come back

then-ah we have a beautiful-

what is the word ah yes i have
it now we have a beautiful hostage
who came here of her own accord
dan set his teeth to check an ex-
plosion sanchez was driving an al-
most impossible bargain he could
at least have taken dans word in
the matter and left al and alice
ford out of it was there no honor
among thieves apparently not
sanchezs smooth oily voice broke
in on his thoughts

  to-night you shall tell me your
plan of accomplishing what has
never been done-taking fifty thou-
sand dollars from the wagon gap
bank

alice ford came for her
brother you shouldnt
 have left your bed al she
scolded im trying to get you back
on the road to good health you
must not worry and you must have
good food and plenty of rest
there was plenty to worry
about he grumbled and theres
still plenty of the same

  no-dan smiled at the girl-
everything has been settled

  the outlaws were separating and
returning to their cabins and the
three were alone

  alice shook her head no noth-
ing is settled until the slate is clean
al and we two are on a ranch some-
where her eyes flashed accusingly
at dan stuart hed have gone
too if youd led tihe way she
charged

  the posse was too close on our
heels al protested

  nonsense retorted the girl he
had already refused to go away and
make a new start and you had
agreed to string with him he would
join sanchez now see what we are
facing

  the glitter in her eyes remained
then suddenly left she smiled wist-
fully im forgetting you saved his 
life by helping him to escape from
beasleys cell she said i do ap-
preciate that but cant you see
al is only a kid after all and that
his priceless sense of loyalty and
appreciation is leading him to stick
to you why hes giving up the
ranch weve worked so hard to build
up hes giving up sally geary-
everything

  im sorry dan muttered but
im following my own inclinations
al i wish youd forget me

  not in a thousand years al
said quietly he could not erase the
memory of the damp cell where he
was dying by inches he was now
in the free air that had come to him
over the prison wall every night and
dan stuart was responsible for all
this

  silence fell between them al was
staring at the half-filled grave and
shuddering dan had put the dra-
matic episode behind him and was
looking ahead but alice could not
take her eyes from dan her wom-
ans intuition was trying to tell her
something but she could not tell
whether it offered consolation and a
promise or was shouting a warning

  she was thinking that this mans
courage was greater than she had
ever seen the outlaws had left
talking of it sanchez and el mudo
had gone up the trail scowling and
uncertain they acted like men on
the defensive even if the outlaw had
driven an impossible bargain

  i wish i understood you dan
stuart she said presently per-
haps if i knew the measure of your

courage-

  that wouldnt help you he said
gently courage has neither weight
nor bulk it cant be measured so
-what is it i dont know but you
have more than i ever hope to pos-
sess he went on all women
have you came unafraid into
calico hole knowing you could
never leave without sanchezs per-
mission you came because you
love your brother if youre think-
ing i showed courage because i
snapped back at sanchez-well for-
get it i had nothing to lose so
why not convince him i came to
join his band a coyote will fight
if cornered

  youre not changing my opinion
mr stuart she calmly informed
him something about you has
eluded me from the first but ive
got it now youre being driven on
by some tremendous purpose and
nothing can stop you you may not
succeed but it wont be because you
havent risked everything to gain
your ends if youll risk your life
then youll risk als and mine-
every ones

  aw come now he protested
youre making me a sort of he-
angel one moment and a devil the
next we seem to have the run of
the hole as long as we dont attempt
to leave lets have a look about
dan stuart she said sharply
you are trying to drag a red her-
ring across the trail well it wont
succeed i wont be thrown off the
scent in any such casual manner
and he saw that she was down-
right angry

  he walked slowly toward the
graves mentally trying to decide
which was the worse-an outlaw

with suspicions or a girl with sus-
picions

  im going to have the last word
he said over his shoulder and
grinned innocent men have been
hanged because somebody jumped
at conclusions or was loose with
words

  and that dan stuart is the red
herring again she answered but
well let it go for the present

  al tired started for his cabin
but alice after a moments
douibt decided to remain
with dan and examined him further
she did not want to make a fool of
herself nor did she care to miss any-
thing which might point to danger
for her brother

  dan walked along reading the
names on the headboards sanchez
had erected they stood however
as monuments of his personal
achievement rather than marks of
respect to the dead dred mor-
ton dan read sheriff mike san-
ders sheriff don remp texas
ranger slim tremper texas
ranger he paused stared and
turned to the girl

  so jud trempers kid brother
slim was killed by sanchez eh he
cried that was the rumor but
hardly anybody believed it

  jud tremper knew it alice
ford answered sanchez sent
tremper slims last letter and a
sketch of the grave and jud went
on a vacation all the tremper
courage is buried in that grave i
guess come lets get out of here
and forget strife murder and
graves lets please find some-
thing beautiful and sweet in life if
only for an hour

  youre right he agreed lets
walk around the hole i see some
mighty fine saddle stock in that east
pasture
outlaws of calico hole



  away from the slope and its
graves away too from sanchez and
the sinister el mudo the hole lost
much of its menace it took on its
real purpose in the scheme of
things-an area several miles square
protected from violent storms and
offering a rock fence a thousand or
more feet high to inclose cattle

  the soil was black loam several
feet in depth and it was almost pos-
sible to hear the grass and vegetables
growing when the sun was shining

  in the wintertime the girl was
saying those crests are covered
with snow i know because ive
seen them from the other side and
when a blizzard strikes the cattle
cant run miles and miles to fall
exhausted and freeze to death
what a grand place for a ranch its
nicer even than our place at calico
springs

  i could do a lot with this he
said half to himself but she heard
him

  then youve not been an outlaw
all of your life she cried in tri-
umph his past life and his present
purpose kept intruding

  no he answered i could
make a ranch of this and-id
like to do it this would be the
home ranch and the cattle could
be driven in off the range and fat-
tened here his face softened
when he saw the horses galloping
across the field with tails and manes
flying and whites of eyes showing
in pretended fear

  in an instant he had changed
from a hard-featured individual
planning bank robbery under des-
perate conditions to a rancher who
dreamed of building instead of de-
stroying the mood lingered and
deepened as they walked on to the
crystal stream and followed it to the
falls the drop broke up the water

and it fluttered to a rocky basin in
billows like wind-blown lace

  everything within a hundred
yards of the spot was moist ferns
grew from the rocks where roots had
lodged in the cracks and trout lay
in rows where the stream left the
basin

  the spell could not last as calico
hole was given to violence not
beauty sanchez followed as usual
by el mudo came from a near-by
thicket and joined them he bowed
with exaggerated politeness at alice
and said

  you will pardon me but-busi-
ness first

  of course she responded and
walked away

  dan decided he was in for another
difficult period reasoning the two
had had an opportunity to think
over the situation and discuss it
from various angles youve got
a nice set-up here sanchez he said

  perfect an army could not take
calico hole sanchez answered
swelling with pride

  i was looking over the graves
dan said i didnt know youd
killed slim tremper

  yes with my own hands hop-
ing his brother would come to
avenge his death he shrugged his
shoulders and rolled his eyes back
alas for the plans and hopes of
man he said then his mood
changed with the swiftness of a
striking snake i cant wait i
must hear of your plan to rob the
wagon gap bank now

  dan stuart was thinking that
this man could shake your hand
then knife you while he smiled into
your eyes as long as he was a part
of sanchezs outfit he would never
know what to expect aloud he
said

  this is the only way it can be
done sanchez weve got to con-

sider first the bank next getting
rid of the hundred or more man
hunters thatll hunt me down now
what do you think of this

  unconsciously he lowered his
voice he talked eagerly for per-
haps five minutes while first surprise
then something approaching admira-
tion came into the outlaws black
eyes even el mudo nodded

  and ill need some gold nug-
gets dan concluded

chapter v

gold nuggets

sanchez and el mudo hav-
ing trailed dan and alice and
studied their faces as they
talked and having listened to dans
plans now seemed willing to forget
the mans presence at least they
walked down to the fence and looked
at the horses then returned to the
big log cabin which was reserved for
them exclusively

  dan followed the stream wishing
he had a hook and line and at the
same time telling himself a water
wheel could be harnessed and made
to churn milk and cut fodder he
stopped at the fence and began
studying the horses they watched
him in mock alarm then suddenly
one whinnied joyously and galloped
up to the fence

  she was a pert little black mare
with a star on her forehead her
legs were slender and there was a
pleasing arrogance in the way she
picked up her hoofs eagerness
filled her eyes and as she curved her
glistening neck and looked at the
man it was a sight to stir the blood
of any horse lover

  ah dan cried softly then as
she thrust her nose toward his
pocket his manner changed some
one was watching he smashed his
elbow against the mares delicate

nose and she reared back in sur-
prise and pain

  get out the man hissed i
havent anything for you

  the brush crackled hut dan did
not look around though there was
a definite nervousness in his eyes

  i saw that alice cried i was
coming through this little thicket to
join you as the mare came up she
recognized you then hearing me
come you struck her why the
girl answered her own query it
is because if sanchez discovers the
mare knows you through her he
may be able to trace some of your
past relations

  miss ford dan answered if
you dont stop imagining things and
what is worse talking about them
you are liable to get me into trou-
ble

  she flushed angrily

  i dont talk but im going to
ask some questions about that
mare she announced it sounded
like a declaration of war i dont
give a darn about a mob of wanted
men who should be strung up to
the nearest cottonwood you in-
cluded but im going to stop at
nothing to protect my brother you
helped him escape and we are
thankful ive said that before and
it comes right from the heart but
hes not going to get into this any
deeper and if in keeping him out
of trouble some wanted man is hurt
im not going to shed any tears
over it

  thats the attitude to take he
answered i wont quarrel with
you stick close to your brother
and dont do anything thatll bring
any grief down on my head and we
can be good friends

  well leave it that way she
agreed in a less truculent tone for
the second time suppose we try to
enjoy the ibeauty of this spot
outlaws of calico hole



  good he agreed grinning
what a sweet friend youd make
and what a remorseless enemy she
was a little spitfire and he knew
he could enjoy her companionship

the day passed swiftly with
dan and alice becoming ac-
quainted with their sur-
roundings and al sleeping in the
sunshine while the sun began the
rebuilding of his abused body the
members of the outlaw band cast
admiring glances at the girl but
none made an effort to become ac-
quainted and dan concluded san-
chez had laid down definite rules for
the regular members of his gang
one girl in an outlaw camp could
cause plenty of trouble several girls
might start a civil war

  they ate together at a long table
set on the piazza sanchez sat at
the head of the table with el mudo
on his right dan and alice found
places at the lower end while al
occupied his old seat little was
said during the meal hour food
was heaped on large dishes which
were passed from hand to hand and
when hands were too busy to pass
a dish darting forks stabbed meat
or potatoes and carried the food
safely to the owners plate

  coffee was gulped down hur-
riedly food was wolfed they ate
and drank as if momentarily expect-
ing to be interrupted by a sheriffs
posse-and this was the stamp of
the wanted man alice watching
dan out of the comer of her eye
observed that he ate as hurriedly as
the others

  after the evening meal the men
rolled cigarettes talked and smoked
slowly but with eyes alert-watch-
ing their surroundings from force of
habit

  al went to bed at eight oclock
and at nine alice followed she

slept in the bunk below him ready
to attend his wants dan was given
a bunk in the adobe house with the
other men

  dan was the first man out the
following morning with the excep-
tion of the cook others appeared
yawning and grumbling as the sun-
light came down the calico walls

  al did not appear for breakfast
but alice hurried in gathered up a
soft-boiled egg some toast and a
glass of milk for him

  i dont know what the poor boy
went through in that jail she said
but he woke up yelling a dozen
times last night

  ive got an idea dan said a
few hours was enough for me

  i heard tell theys something
queer with beasleys set-up down
there in wagon gap a man ob-
served theys talk the texas
rangers are lookin into it but i
dont know probly just talk

  a yaller dog gets bettern what
beasley gives some white men down
there another said

  alice left but presently returned
she ate without enthusiasm the
others left the table to begin card
games that lasted throughout the
day

  noon brought an excited man just
before the cook sounded the dinner
call

  thet black mare with the white
star in her forehead is gone he
shouted

  whats that sanchez cried
scowling at dan stuart

  alices eyes were on him also

  dan squirmed impatiently

  well dont look at me he com-
plained i wasnt out of bed all
night and therere plenty of the
boys to prove it

  several men confirmed this state-
ment
 

street  smiths western story magazine

  sanchez stared at each in turn
then turned to dan again

  no horses took a notion to leave
before you came the outlaw leader
said it looks bad for you
your men are light sleepers
dan retorted every time i turned
over somebody woke up and looked
at me a fine chance id have had
to sneak out and get away with a
horse without somebody hearing
me

  she couldnt get through the
barbed wire down at the entrance
sanchez said thoughtfully so she
must have had some help

  that mare could a man argued
shes the smartest little trick we
ever put a rope on

  there the subject dropped

dan you look like a sheep-
herder alice said when the
third day found him with a
heavy black stubble covering his
face cant you borrow a razor
im afraid not dan explained
im growing a beard for important
reasons ive got two months to do
it

  part of your plan to rob the
wagon gap bank i suppose she
asked

  yes but only part the plan is
rather complicated but it must suc-
ceed he said

  i think youd risk life and for-
tune on the turn of a card she in-
formed him bluntly

  ive done so he answered ill
do so again its not hard if you
draw the card

  from that moment alice fords
tactics changed she no longer ar-
gued with dan or tried to trick him
into an admission of the plan she
intuitively felt he was following but
made an effort to win his confidence
she moved slowly drifting into
friendship in the days that followed

but listening attentively to every-
thing he said then trying to piece
things together yet with rather poor
success

  there were times during that first
week when it looked as if the girls
brother might steadily sink the
reaction to his escape was tremen-
dous and his condition took a criti-
cal turn al talked of death con-
stantly and expressed his thanks
again and again to dan he regret-
ted he could not go along when dan
raided the ibank

  id like to show you what you
mean to me he whispered id
like to stand behind you and back
your play

 and dan who watched at als
side while alice cried softly into her
handkerchief laughed and told the
sick man the account between them
was squared

  if you do owe me anything al
he said if you really feel that way
about it shake off this morbid
streak and get well youre an
eagle you know and youre back
among the peaks and that should
answer everything

 youre not lying to me al
asked eagerly ive got a chance

  if i didnt think you were going
to get well al dan lied id be
running around trying to do some-
thing about it i didnt get you out
of jail just to attend your funeral
you know now confound you
turn over and go to sleep he
grinned and walked away

  alice followed dan outside

  hes breathing so hard and cant
seem to rest she sobbed you de-
ceived him bless you ibut you didnt
deceive me i saw the muscles in
your face work as you talked to
him

  i guess you did alice he ad-
mitted one of my kid brothers
is dead and im pretty soft where
outlaws of calico hole



youngsters are concerned my fa-
ther died when i was twelve and
the children two boys and two girls
younger than i looked to me for
food and later advice they looked
on me at times as a very old man

  he threw his arm across her shoul-
der and she pressed her eyes against
his shirt for several wretched sec-
onds

  im better now by morning we
should know one way or the other

  yes one way or the other he
told her

  at five oclock she came to the
adobe and called him though he had
remained at als side until three
oclock

  hes hardly breathing she ex-
plained and i dont want to be
there alone

  dan dressed and hurried over
he looked down briefly then whis-
pered

  go to bed and sleep yourself
hes enjoying the first normal rest he
has known in months

improvement from that
hour was gradual als appe-
tite had to be checked to pre-
vent a setback he walked about
the buildings gradually increasing
the distance then he rede grinning
boyishly from a saddle that had car-
ried more than one outlaw through
a successful raid

  the fourth week the three awak-
ened to find the cabins strangely si-
lent the cook had set but seven
places at the long table and four
of these were occupied by members
of the band they were on edge
this morning and it was obvious
they were also on guard against dan
stuart

  the others are away on busi-
ness one of the men said gruffly
and sanchez said nobodys to leave

camp no ridin around lookin at
the scenery

  when they were alone al ex-
plained nobody but sanchez
knows when theyre going raiding
youll be asleep and somebody
wakes you up and says get up
were ridin to-night we dress go
out saddle and sanchez leads off
with el mudo bringing up the rear
el mudo rides behind eh
sure just in case somebody
takes a notion to pot sanchez from
behind theres ten thousand dol-
lars reward on his head you know
el mudo is the only one sanchez
really trusts al said

  whenll they be back dan
asked

  its hard to tell al replied
whats to prevent the rangers
from waiting for them at the en-
trance dan inquired i hope to
be a part of this outfit some day
and id like to know where ill meet
danger and what measures are taken
for a mans protection

  sanchez has plenty of friends
wholl let him know when strange
faces appear al replied

  friends dans eyes narrowed
well maybe not friends but peo-
ple who have a healthy respect for
the peculiar forms sanchezs revenge
takes when some one informs on
him alice said

  the day and night passed with-
out incident save for an increasing
nervousness on the part of the out-
laws remaining in the hole the
next afternoon the band returned
sanchez in the lead el mudo bring-
ing up the rear and a wounded man
swaying in the saddle

  those who stayed behind sprang
into action taking first the wounded
man to a bunk then caring for the
horses the animals ridden until
they were ready to drop were caked
with dust and dried lather one

bore a nasty crease where a bullet
had struck its shoulder flies were
already buzzing around the wound

  ill fix up this nag dan volun-
teered

  go ahead an outlaw agreed
weve got to dig a slug out of joes
back

the horse winced under dans
ministrations and joe bel-
lowed with pain as his com-
panions applied rough surgery
through it all sanchez paced the
piazza with tigerish strides striving
to relax from the long tense hours
el mudo of different stuff sat
calmly in a chair and smoked

  peace of a sort settled down on
the group by evening the meal
was late the cook wisely waiting un-
til the men had relaxed good wine
before the meal mellowed their hard-
ness slightly and conversation grew
brisk

  one laughed suddenly ill never
forget the look on that cashiers face
when i told him we was the sanchez
band sweat came out on his face
and he shook all over i let him
have it he knew he was goin to
die and he looked like somebody
whose feelins was hurt he roared
with laughter his hands was
clawin at the ceilin and he was
yellin his head off

  but the funniest was that deputy
sheriff a second man said he
had a bead on me and was just
about to pull the trigger when san-
chez stuck his gun over the wall and
let him have it smack the bul-
let got him in the stomach and he
grabbed hisself and danced a jig
then fell head-first into the dirt head
buttin round on the ground and
feet still dancin up and down haw
haw haw

  laughter ran around the table

  that was his wife that come yell-
in out of the house the first said
never knowed a woman could yell
like that

  alice dropped her knife and fork
and left the table again laughter
spread

  too much for the gal some one
cried

  al finished his meal and followed
alice

  therell be a big drunk to-night
he explained they got ten thou-
sand dollars and are feelin good
al juno can you throw in with
such a crowd the girl asked in a
wretched voice and you dan-
you laughed with them

  i threw in with them to get some
of our cattle two-spot delaney had
branded and now im in with them
up to my ears al answered wed
better hide out he went on in a
low voice until this celebration is
ended if dans underfoot some-
bodys liable to call him jud trem-
per or beasley in disguise and if
they see you alice somebodyll
want to start a dance and thatll
start a fight

  the three withdrew to the brush
and spent the night listening to the
brawling of those involved only
el mudo remained sober sanchez
drank alone in his room brooding
building up wrongs real and fancied
and promising revenge that would
take diabolical forms

  it was dawn before the men fell
asleep when the three returned to
get a little rest on their own ac-
count

there were no more raids
sanchez deciding to appear
to let things quiet down and
give dan his chance at the wagon
gap bank two months from the
day dan entered the hole sanchez

ws-b
outlaws of calico hole



sent for him on the table lay
placer gold to the value of two thou-
sand dollars

  the times come for you to get
that fifty thousand dollars in the
bank he explained your beard
has grown out and heres the gold
you needed you know whatll hap-
pen to al ford if you dont come
back

  dan nodded i think al will try
to string along with me he thinks
im tackling an impossible job hes
got the idea he owes me something

  yes you are tackling an im-
possible job sanchez said unpleas-
antly it was your bluff and i
called it i hold the cards as usual
the men are betting ten to one you
dont get away with it he smiled
they are betting fifty to one you
will be glad to get out and leave al
holding the sack i hope you do
my friend i am about ready to
settle down and enjoy the profits of
my labors i know of a place across
the mexican border where a man
could spend his days

  yes

  yes and the bible says it is
not good for man to live alone i
have done alice ford the honor of
asking her to become my wife she
refused his face grew wolfish
refused because of my indian
blood well if you dont come back
and al faces death at my hands the
lady might listen to reason she
might be persuaded to change her
mind

  youve done a little figuring
ahead sanchez dan answered
well so have i the lady doesnt
figure in the plan nor al youve
laid up a snug fortune against your
old age i wont last forever in this
life so im robbing wagon gap as
agreed and throwing in with you
ill leave to-morrow night

 ws-b

  good to-morrow night san-
chez smacked his lips with satisfac-
tion again he was figuring ahead
ive done everything possible to
help you my friend he added
softly i and my men have stayed
at home so that the people will not
be watchful

  thanks for being fair about it
dan replied

  he sauntered away and sanchez
sent for miguel one of his follow-
ers who like himself possessed an
apache strain

  miguel entered the room and
seated himself sanchez poured him
a drink and miguel knew what was
coming

  you will go down and tell our
friend-our good friend in wagon
gap-a prospector will come with
gold nuggets and he plans to leave
with gold coin from the bank our
good friend will know what to do
when he hears this prospector is dan
stuart

  miguel smiled finished his drink
and left the room sanchez knew
the job was as good as done

  the outlaw leader drew deeply on
his cigarette dans plan is good
-so good i shall try it myself some-
time again he drew deeply on the
cigarette and watched the smoke
drift away things were going along
in a highly satisfactory manner

chapter vi

beasley moves in

dan stuart was ready to
start at daybreak the out-
laws slumbered but he saw
a light in alices cabin and presently
the girl came through the gray shad-
ows of dawn

  i want to talk to you she said
alone-over here where the walls
havent ears


street  smiths western story magazine

  she led the way to a thicket
something in her face caused his
pulse to quicken they had grown
close the last few weeks al could
not forget dan freed him from beas-
leys cell then took care of him when
the pursuit got hot alice could not
forget dan had stood over her
brother when he was at deaths
crossroads and laughed at the
thought of his dying and so filled
the youth with confidence that he
renewed the fight and was now well

  dan must you go she asked

  does it mean so much to you
alice he countered looking down
into her serious face i mean my
angle not alsm he explained

  you know it does dan she said
quietly

  he drew a deep breath as if the
problems that lay ahead were diffi-
cult i think the time has come
he said slowly to tell you that i
love you he turned her chin up
and smiled into her eyes alice
you are loyal sweet and courageous
i like you here in calico hole with
the mighty walls the falls the rich
bottom land and the cattle it is
a picture-this he swept his hand
over a land awakening and you
complete it

  i love you dan if you could
only remain the dan i love and not
be a predatory wolfish creature lust-
ing for blood some of the time we
could be happy she looked
gravely about but i can see noth-
ing ahead but heartache

  things have a way of working
themselves out he answered
youve something else on your
mind it was a statement not a
query

  yes dan i have i cant shake
off the conviction you are hewing
to a line and that you dont care
much where the chips fall she went

on hurriedly to gain your ends
youll sacrifice your own life
why shouldnt a man sacrifice
everything to gain an end he ar-
gued

  but its not fair not just for
you to sacrifice my brother oh
dan hes all ive got hes deter-
mined to string with you it all goes
back to the living death he endured
under beasley you saved him and
now he feels he should give up
everything in return it means he
will trail you to wagon gap and
that he will follow you on future
raids with sanchezs band if you suc-
ceed and become a member it
means hanging or violent death in
the long run now dan i put it
squarely up to you does anything
justify that

  no from your standpoint yes
from mine im going ahead als
got to use some sense he grimly
declared and i want him to keep
out of it ill tell sanchez to stop
him from following me

  dan started to go but the girl in
a frenzy of fear flung herself into
his arms

  i cant let you go dan she
sobbed oh i love you so much
you can be so gentle and fine
lets develop that and fight off the
wolf streak together ill go any-
where with you shoot our way out
of this place with you if youll only
let me help you dan

  her outburst shook him she felt
him tremble from head to foot and
his arms tightened then relaxed

  no he answered its too late
for me to turn iback now im going
ahead

  then if youre going to the devil
dan stuart ill go along with you
i dont care what becomes of me
now a days happiness or a weeks
it doesnt matter just so i get it
im going

el mudo came from a tangle
of boulders forty feet away
his instincts had warned him
to watch the pair his eyes had read
the girls lips he came over and
caught her arm and with a jerk of
his huge head ordered dan to go
she struggled desperately but el
mudo held her helpless dan
walked over to the three burros he
had saddled for his expedition he
mounted one and drove the other
two ahead of him he did not look
back but swung toward the big
cabin sanchez was standing before
an open window

  dont let al follow dan re-
quested

  no i wont let him follow san-
chez replied adios

  slong dan answered

  slowly he rode down the trail
past the slope with its gruesome let-
ters then through the barbed wire
and on to calico springs

  the sun was up when he stopped
at the twin f ranch the indian
woman who had served alice so
long was sitting on the steps silent
dejected he wondered if she would
recognize him so said

  hello wheres everybody

  she pointed toward the entrance
to calico hole then back to a no-
tice on the front door dan read
the copy of a lengthy legal docu-
ment tacked to the panel the im-
port was plain the man holding
the mortgage had declared the ranch
abandoned and to protect his in-
terest had foreclosed beasley had
bought the place at a forced sale

  and you can bet he got it for a
song dan reflected that poor
squaw dont know what to do
either i suppose she figured this
would be her home as long as she
lived

  he prodded the burros into action

and continued on toward wagon
gap some thirty miles away

  dan stopped near the geary ranch
that afternoon and watered the bur-
ros sally came down to the fence
and watched him she was thin and
dispirited and said nothing a
burly man hard at work dan con-
cluded was chris geary her father

  dan made one camp and arrived
on the outskirts of wagon gap late
the next afternoon dusk was fall-
ing when he entered the town and
this suited his purpose he put the
burros up in an empty bam back
of the bank then spread his blankets
on the bunk of an abandoned cabin
the throb of life came faintly from
the main street he opened the
stove and brought out a quantity of
gray wood ashes which he rubbed
thoroughly in his hair and beard
unless one examined him too
closely he could pass in the dusk
for a gray-headed man not so
bad he mused examining his fea-
tures in a cracked mirror

  he was building a fire in the stove
when the door opened suddenly
sanchez had equipped him with a
pair of old s and instinctively his
hands dropped to the butts of these
untried guns

  dont shoot dan its al the
door closed and al ford stood there
smiling and confident sanchez let
me come after i talked him into it
he hastily explained dont get
mad now this is too big for any
one man to tackle alone

  all right dan answered briefly
but suppose youre recognized

  ive got to take that chance
now heres whats happened beas-
ley for no reason i can figure out
is headed this way its no chance
stroll al went on hurriedly ive
seen him walk too many times not
to know when he means business
what do you want me to do


street  smiths western story magazine

  ill meet him dan answered
he hastily examined his weapons
the cartridges were new and the
guns appeared to work smoothly

he stepped outside it was
light enough to see a hun-
dred yards away but be-
yond that it was indistinct a
deadly calm possessed dan as he
walked up the alley and his mind
groped for an answer to beasleys
sudden decision to come directly to
him its no hunch hes following
he told himself its a hot tip from
somebody if i cant shut him up
without a gun fight i wont have
much chance to clean out the bank
there he is

  beasley carried a  in his right
hand his left was resting lightly on
the butt of a second weapon dan
walked stiffly with head slightly
bent hoping to carry out his role
of an old prospector a hundred
feet separated them then beasleys
hand came up

  stick em up he snarled i

know you youre-

  dans gun leaped and flame
stabbed into the dusk the roar of
the weapon silenced beasleys words
dust spurted from the front and
back of his shirt then he pitched
forward though the man had had
dan covered yet the latter had
drawn and fired before beasleys
brain could catch the movement and
telegraph the order to pull the trig-
ger his gun remained silent

  you got him dan al cried
better light out the whole town
will be here in a minute

  listen al i came here to rob a
bank dans fingers grasped als
arm youve made a lot of cracks
about what youd do for me you
said youd die if need be and thats
the right spirit youve a chance to
prove it take my gun he

pressed the warm weapon into al
fords hands then yanked one of
fords guns from the holster and
thrust it into his own holster
stand up to it tell any yarn you
want to al and leave it to me to
get you out of this savvy
yes al ford answered in be-
wilderment

  people were running and before
he could offer further comment dan
had slunk into the shadows and was
making his way to the cabin

  a ring of guns hemmed al in a
moment later unfriendly eyes
peered into his face

  say a man shouted this is al
ford one of sanchezs gang by
gosh he came here to get beasley
and he got him

  i-i-came here for-for medi-
cine al said uncertainly my sis-
ters sick beasley got the drop on
me i told him id quit but he said
hed fix me so i couldnt get away
again i knew he was going to
shoot he could call it self-defense
and get himself in the clear no-
body would believe me so i beat
him to it

  nobody believes you now a
voice bellowed string him up
boys up with him

  just a minute a shaky voice
objected it wont look so good
boys for us to take the law into our
own hands dan stuart bent and
apparently feeble was trying to
make himself heard

  who are you some one de-
manded

  just old hi manning but i know
how things like this turn out dan
said his words had no influence
except to delay matters but the de-
lay proved sufficient

  a brisk individual wearing a
deputy sheriffs shield pushed his
way through

  so you killed beasley eh the
outlaws of calico hole



deputy peered closer al ford i
wouldnt have known you

  i look different al said ive
been out in the fresh air and sun
it looks like a case of revenge
youll swing sure for this the
deputy snapped handcuffs about
als wrists come on

  back to the damp cell again
eh al said bitterly

  no not this time the texas
rangers have that business under
fire were expecting a man any
time to show up and ask questions
about prisoners who died awaiting
trial he hurried al along i
never favored such treatment for an
outlaw anyway arrest em try
em hang em-thats my motto
but beasley and his crowd run the
country and i had nothing to say
about it

  al recognized him as a deputy
who was kept on the fringe of the
county most of the time he ap-
peared to have plenty of the stuff
a western peace officer needs al
was hurried into an upper cell where
there was plenty of fresh air and a
fine view of the wall and guards
an hour later the prosecuting at-
torney appeared to ask questions
and briefly discuss the matter with
the deputy

  well make a record for speed in
this case the prosecutor said
tersely we should have him in
the penitentiary ready to be hanged
within thirty days

  the deputy nodded as the two
walked away

chapter vii

stampede

dan stuart as hi man-
ning returned to the cabin
unnoticed in the excitement
a grim smile played around his lips
til say this much for al-when he

said he was willing to die for me he
wasnt talking through his hat the
loyalty of a young fellow is an amaz-
ing and beautiful thing

  having made this observation
dan prepared and ate a good meal
then made his way to dick mitch-
ells general store he turned his
coat up about his ears and pulled
his hat down over his eyes

  i want some grub he explained
ive made a little strike so ill pay
you for it in gold

  gold eh mitchells interest
quickened i havent ysed my gold
scales in years wheres the strike
didnt say dan answered
briefly itll be mostly bacon flour
sugar coffee and-you know what
i need

  several men gathered about and
began to ask questions dan put
them off with evasive answers and
walked about the store peering into
show cases when he opened the
poke and displayed the nuggets the
men were six deep about him

  mitchell weighed out the gold
and his fingers seemed to caress each
nugget

  as pretty gold as ive ever seen
he said whered you say it came
from

  didnt say dan replied again
a friendly hand fell on dans
shoulder say old-timer have a
little drink

  nope dan snapped still its
been a long time since i had a good
snort of whisky he accepted the
bottle and eyed it with approval
well one little drink never hurt
nobody he swallowed an ounce
or two ah that hit the spot
take a swig of mine urged a
second man youll never be the
same man again itll knock ten
years off your life

  if it dont knock my teeth out
dan retorted he drank again


street  smiths western story magazine

after that he refused nope he
told them if i drink too much ill
be talking and i cant afford to do
that

  well just one more wont hurt
a persuasive voice insisted

  all right this is the last dan
declared

  he drank frequently and pres-
ently began to sing they joined in
calling him good old hi manning
he mellowed

  say youre all nice boys he said
thickly i can see youre men of
dis-discretion im goin to tell
you a lile secret theys gold up on
sundown creek i took out two
thousand dollars in nuggets inside
- he looked around in bewil-
derment whered everybody go

  im afraid youve started a stam-
pede mitchell said you men-
tioned sundown creek and by to-
morrow noon there will not be an
able-bodied man left in town he
slapped dans shoulder youd
better go home and sleep it off
come around in the morning and
ill have the grub ready to throw
on your burros

  thanks dan stuart muttered
thanks in the darkness he
grinned broadly

all night there were sounds
of hasty departure but dan
 slept peacefully things
were moving along so smoothly that
luck appeared to be with him al
had conveniently appeared to shoul-
der the responsibility of beasleys
well-deserved death and dan had
tricked the towns famous man hunt-
ers into stampeding

  at ten oclock dan dusted him-
self with ashes once more and
started for mitchells with one
burro he passed through a narrow
space between the bank and a build-
ing then turned into the main

street mitchell was sleepy but
cheerful

  they just about cleaned off my
shelves he said this town was
sure ripe for a stampede

  some day ill learn to either quit
drinkin or keep my mouth shut
when i do drink dan answered
he carried several packs to the
burro divided the load and threw a
diamond hitch over it ill be back
in about fifteen minutes he said

  he turned back between the bank
and building again stopped the
burro and pulled a black shirt over
his head a moment later he drew
on a pair of worn overalls jerked a
battered black hat from a cache in
the brush and pulled it down over
his eyes he covered his face and
neck with a handkerchief leaving
slits for the eyes

  his hands were perspiring from
nervousness that did not otherwise
show outwardly he was about to
do something he had failed to do
once and which no man had suc-
cessfully accomplished he watched
saw a man enter the bank then
leave it the street was now de-
serted those occupied were in-
doors the unoccupied portion of the
towns population was hurrying to
sundown creek

  dan cut around the corner and
in three strides was in the bank
with gun drawn he leaped over the
counter and was behind the cage be-
fore the teller realized it the
president was sitting in his office
he reached for a gun and changed
his mind

 keep your hands up dan
barked both of you thats fine
now back into that little room
he indicated a wash room back of
the vault you are getting better
every minute he drawled closing
and locking the door on them

  he leaped into the tellers cage
outlaws of calico hole



and scooped up all the currency in
sight then walked into the vault
gold was too heavy to carry so he
searched for currency stuffing the
neat bundles into a small bag five
minutes after he entered the job was
done he slipped out unobserved
cut around the corner to the burro
and shed the clothing he had used
in the raid

  at the barn dan hid the currency
in his packs then taking the second
burro plodded up to the store the
banker and his teller had not es-
caped yet dan was loading the
second burro with mitch ells help
when the banker emerged

holdup holdup he bellowed
that cant be dan muttered
i aint seen nor heard a thing
nor i mitchell agreed he ran
toward the banker when did it
happen ned

  right now you crazy fool ned
roared wheres everybody get
a posse throw it around the town
he cant be far

  what sort of a feller was it
dan yelled

  big man black shirt overalls
and black hat had his face cov-
ered but i saw his eyes blackern
night he was a young man
straight as an arrow wheres the
deputy sheriff

  gone on the stampede mitch-
ell answered i sold him grub last
night

  several old men hurried up and
asked questions they ran stiffly
for guns and mounted the horses
the stampeders had left behind
mitchell closed his store and joined
them while dan stuart and his bur-
ros moved slowly toward sundown
creek

  two miles from town he changed
his direction toward calico springs
five miles beyond that he peered in-
tently into a thicket a beautiful

bay horse snorted defiantly then
calmed down under the understand-
ing touch of his hand

  easy jerry easy now youre
sure full of ginger arent you
dan picked up a saddle cached
in the brush and threw it onto jer-
rys back he transferred the cur-
rency to the saddlebags cached the
grub in the brush and released the
burros leaping into the saddle he
grinned defiantly back at wagon
gap well it was done-and done
right he chuckled his spurs
touched jerrys flanks and the horse
thundered away nose toward calico
hole

dan approached calico hole
cautiously half expecting
some one might be lying in
the brush with the hope of inter-
cepting him evidently those back
at wagon gap were still trying to
pick up the bank robbers trail as
nobody was visible sanchezs band
accordingly was cleared and the
crime credited to a lone wolf dan
rode into the hole unchallenged but
the guard called down

  what luck

  plenty dan shouted up to him
good i took some of the
twenty-to-one money you wouldnt
put it over-not bad though i
could have got longer odds if id
waited wheres al ford

  briefly dan explained and rode
on remembering he must face alice
before the night was over this
came sooner than he expected the
girl stepped into the trail and
waved him down near the grave-
yard it was growing dark and they
were not visible from the cabins

  ive been here ever since al left
she cried where is he what
happened

  hes not hurt alice but hes in
a jam dan assured her dismount-


street  smiths western story magazine

ing beasley forced a sale and took
over your place al met him and
killed him he had it coming a
thousand times over theyre hold-
ing al for trial

  is he charged with murder she
asked in a dull voice

  yes thats what i heard
youll see him through she
pleaded youll promise me that
wont you dan

  i promise ill see him through
theyll never hang him dan in-
sisted

  oh my darling she cried bro-
kenly youre a good friend and
ive been a friend to you listen
do you remember the little black
mare with the star in her forehead
you couldnt forget her because she
knew you and in some way linked
you with the past well i tried to
find out where she came from but
no one would tell me she was dan-
gerous to you and so that night it
was i who turned her loose i was
sure she went home

  horses do that he said
would it be to your home dan
she asked

  likely he answered

  and you did you succeed
his arm was about her slim waist
her tragic eyes searching his face

  you are priceless he whispered
yes i got away with it i followed
my plan and had some luck-not a
shot fired now id better report
to sanchez he kissed her and she
clung tightly to him then walked
along beside him until they were in
the shadows of sanchezs cabin

  in parting she noticed the horse
for the first time

  hes beautiful where did you
get him she asked

 i roped him on my way to
wagon gap had him tied and wait-
ing for me i call him jerry dan
said

  he looks like a horse thatd be
called jerry alice observed

  she patted his neck and was gone
dan dismounted and knocked san-
chezs voice answered

  the outlaw leader was not happy
over dans return he had expected
failure had hoped and planned for
it he expected both dan and al
to be either killed or arrested or
perhaps dan would not return and
he could drive a bargain with alice
he had played the game from sev-
eral angles yet dan stood before
him and that meant he sanchez
had been denied the chance to rob
the bank and add to his infamy
his face betrayed nothing but pleas-
ure however

  ah my friend you came back
that means-

  exactly dan interrupted
and heres the money count it
he carried the currency on his arm
as he might have carried wood for
a fire it thudded softly to the
table and el mudos eyes lighted
greedily

  sanchez estimated the total
roughly at thirty thousand dollars
i expected fifty thousand maybe
more he said but you did a
good piece of work wheres al

  in jail for killing beasley in a
gun fight dan said bluntly

 hm-m-m sanchez betrayed
nothing at first then his face lighted
as he saw possibilities in the situa-
tion hm-m-m he repeated it
will cost a lot of money to clear
him

  i know where to get it dan
said its a tough job but it can
be done if youve got a dozen men
who arent afraid of a fight

  where

  the bank at el rio dan re-
plied tossing a sheet of paper on
the table i saw this on the presi-
outlaws of calico hole



dents desk there were several
copies so i took one

  sanchez glanced at the paper and
read

    -relative to the sum of one hun-
  dred thousand dollars indebtedness of
  the el rio state bank to the wagon
  gap state bank please be advised we
  have informed the various ranchers to
  whom the money was advanced the
  loan must be paid

    we have assurance the entire sum
  will be available on the twentieth of
  next month and will be forwarded as
  you instruct-

  you want to ease up and so do
i sanchez and that looks like our
chance if im now a member of
your band ill take your orders if
im an outsider then id like to pull
out pick up a few good men and
go after that money myself what
is the answer

 sanchez drummed on the table
with long artistic fingers the ciga-
rette in his lips drooped glowed
then grayed across the burning end
smoke came from his lips slowly

 you are a member of the band
my friend the outlaw answered
join the others and await orders
all right but first i think ill
wash off the dirt and enjoy a good
shave dan replied as he left the
room el mudo who as usual had
been watching came over and joined
his chief

chapter viii

a bargain

sanchez slept soundly after
his discussion with el mudo
and awakened feeling well
pleased with himself true dan
stuart had done the unexpected
looted the bank and returned safely
but he had brought thirty thousand
dollars and information of a hundred
thousand dollars at el rio

  true also dan had not run away

and forfeited al fords life which
would have enabled the outlaw to
drive a good bargain with alice on
the other hand al would require
considerable money for defense so
it followed he could still drive a bar-
gain he was bright and cheerful
at the breakfast table and his men
who feared him warmed under his
geniality

  after breakfast he motioned to
alice my pretty friend i have
something to tell you in private
wont you come in

  yes alice answered avithout
hesitation i want to talk to you
too

  she seated herself and looked
about the room el mudo appeared
but sanchez waved him aside after
a moments hesitation the dumb one
departed

  the girl began the conversation
al is a member of your band mr
sanchez she said and is to be
placed on trial

  he was not engaged in my work
rather he insisted on joining dan
stuart in a private enterprise san-
chez interrupted

  you got the loot she bluntly
stated als in jail are you go-
ing to leave him there

  his defense can be arranged i
shall speak plainly a shade of
apprehension crossed her face then
it returned to its normal calmness
you have been here in my hands
for two months my friend my rule
here is absolute i hold the life or
death of every living thing in calico
hole in my hands even so toward
you i have not been-let us say of-
fensive

  youve been a gentleman for
reasons of your own she answered
go ahead and lets hear the rest
of it

  he bowed i am almost ready
to marry and settle down my wife


street  smiths western story magazine

will wear beautiful clothes and will
never soil her hands with work i
could marry you by force but you
are a fury when aroused sometime
there would be a reckoning and id
be killed by your knife or bullet
yes there would be a reckon-
ing she assured him

  but you would keep your word
and make good on a bargain he
wen t on so ill make a bargain if
you will marry me ill stop at noth-
ing to free your brother

  if hes convicted will you go
down and rescue him by force she
countered

 yes he replied you dont
like me now you hate me he
went on but in time you would
change and we would be happy
after all im no ordinary man im
the greatest of the wanted men in
the southwest even the pride of
the rangers jud tremper wont
risk his reputation against me
when im about he looks the other
way and leaves texas for a rest
ill think it over sanchez the
girl said in a toneless voice

  he stood up and bowed as alice
left the room the door closed and
sanchez was alone with his thoughts
which were decidedly pleasing he
ruled by fear and power he knew
too dan stuart and alice ford
were drawn toward each other he
wasnt so sure about dan but in a
hundred ways the girl had betrayed
an attachment for the man he en-
joyed blasting this possible romance
by sheer force and he was not per-
turbed that evening when he saw
the two meet and walk toward the
falls

a lice did not beat around the
bush but got to the point at
once what would you say
dan if i married sanchez in return
for als freedom she saw him

wince and some of the color left
his bronzed cheeks

  if i didnt understand what al
means to you he said at last id
say you were a fool but if he
means that much and theres no
other way then it looks as if you
would have to accept sanchezs of-
fer

  the reason i came to you dan
she said is because i thought you
might figure the way out of this
a man who can successfully plan
and carry through the robbery of
the wagon gap bank should see a
way out of my problem ive so
much faith in you dan it was
a gracious tribute to his ability

  dan caught his breath sharply
and his arm swept her to him with
crushing force

  alice he cried t love you
then i shall refuse sanchezs of-
fer she asked you know time
is limited and we must move fast
yes thats the tough part of it
time is limited he scowled at his
feet as they walked sanchez
knows it who would have thought
when i decided to throw in with
sanchez a situation like this would
pop up

  if youd just give up your origi-
nal plan she urged we would get
out of here some way then see al

through-

  that is impossible he crisply
informed her im going ahead
hoping for the best

  then she snapped turning on
her heel i dont mean a darned
thing to you and youve failed me
theres only one thing left for me-
sanchezs offer im going to ac-
cept

  alice

  oh be still she cried angrily
a man who really cared for a girl

would- oh whats the use of

talking you dont understand any-
outlaws of calico hole



thing nor care for anybody but
yourself

  im going to get in one word
he growled be sure you dont
marry sanchez until al is in the
clear will you promise me that
yes she flung over her shoul-
der as she hurried away her fists
were clenched and tears were run-
ning down her cheeks at first they
were angry tears then they changed
to the tears of a girl who was griev-
ously disappointed in the man she
loved

  sanchez was smoking and walking
the piazza and as she neared her
cabin he saw her his eyes nar-
rowed and he smiled he knew
when a girl was angry with her lover
and experience had taught him when
a girl is blinded by anger she is in-
clined to do foolish things there
is a very human desire to want to
show somebody a thing or two

  alice he called softly have
you made up your mind

  yes she answered desperately
im going to accept your bargain
ah you make me happy one
minute please he moved with
his tigerish stride into the cabin and
returned in a moment with a dia-
mond ring stolen he said
proudly five years ago and treas-
sured until this hour he slipped
the ring onto alices finger con-
scious her hand was like clay he
bowed and kissed the hand mock-
ery in his eyes while she stood rigid
until he had released her hand the
first link in the chain he was forg-
ing to hold her was gold

  now what are you going to do
about al she asked

  in the morning you shall leave
for wagon gap provided with
money he promised

  then it had better not be money
dan stuart stole from the bank

she suggested or theyll arrest me
too

  it shall be money i received in
an honest transaction my sweet-
heart-the sale of rustled cattle
good night and-pleasant dreams
he said softly as she ran up the
steps and entered her cabin

  alice left calico hole the fol-
lowing morning carrying five
thousand dollars and on her
arrival at wagon gap she put up
at the best hotel a two-story brick
building next to the bank the
deputy sheriff in charge of the dis-
trict having returned from a wild-
goose chase to sundown creek
promptly called he did not bow
nor kiss her hand but he was po-
lite and smiling though firm

  ive got to ask you some ques-
tions miss ford where have you
been the last two months

 i havent been robbing any
banks nor aiding any one in a jail
break she answered evenly al
broke jail with dan stuarts help
they called at our ranch and rode
on to calico hole al was sick and
i did what any sister would do-
followed him into the hole and
cared for him if thats a crime in
texas youre going to have a sweet
time getting a jury of texans to
convict any girl for doing as i have
done and she smiled right back
at him im here to see al is given
justice something he did not get
before i have been provided with
money-not stolen money either-
and im going to send for judge
ritchie to act as als attorney

  ive no quarrel with you miss
the deputy answered al did get
a wrong deal from beasley in jail
beasley controlled politics and
things happened some of us liked
none too well your brother is in


street  smiths western story magazine

a good cell and you may visit him
however you must remember al
has been with sanchez also that he
did kill beasley an officer who was
trying to arrest him

  im not forgetting that for a
moment she told him that is
why im hiring judge ritchie

  the deputy took his departure
confident he had not been talking
to a woman outlaw something he
thought possible when he first
called alice remained in her room
that evening but an open window
brought voices from the street and
she listened attentively trying to
gauge the townsfoiks temper to a
man they were in an angry mood
but it was the anger of smart peo-
ple who had been cleverly outwit-
ted they had found no gold at
sundown creek the bank had been
robbed during their absence and a
genial old prospector had vanished
it looked like a sanchez job how
much longer they asked each other
would the texas rangers let the
outlaw get away with his raids

  how many of you want to walk
into the hole and get him some
one asked theres ten thousand
dollars reward on his head and you
dont see me trying to collect nor
you nor you there aint men
enough in this part of texas to take
that hole i used to be a ranger
myself jud tremper may have
drifted when sanchezs name was
mentioned but the rest of the out-
fit hasnt quit now that beasleys
dead weve got a chance to do a
little house cleaning hereabouts and
im in favor of it so lets quit belly -
achin because sanchez or whoever
it was got us out of town and
robbed the bank

  after that the tone of the men
on the street changed and alice felt
al would at least receive justice

a telegram from judge
ritchie stated he would ar-
rive within a week alice
was reading this when sally geary
called she was followed by her fa-
ther who twisted his hat in his hand
and unburdened his conscience

  alice he growled i told sally
if she had anything to do with al
id horsewhip her and-i
wouldve i was wrong the way
beasley swooped down on the twin
f told me there was something
queer about it i snooped a bit and
found delaney a friend of beasleys
did brand twin f calves al com-
plained and they just laughed at
him being hot-tempered and
young he threw in with sanchez
and thats just what was wanted
al got caught and beasley tried to
murder him by degrees in that
cussed cell

  so far it looks as if you were
right alice said

  darned right im right chris
geary roared come to think
about it two three small ranchers
died in jail and later beasley picked
up their ranches for a song well
i said to myself chris geary sal-
lys the finest gal in the world and
shes in love with al als gettin
a raw deal so by gosh chris back
them young kids to the limit so
im here alice well mortgage that
ranch and throw the money into the
pot for als defense

  chris youre grand alice ex-
claimed wiping her eyes but the
moneys been provided shall we go
over and see al sally

  oh can we sally cried

  alice with the gearys walked to
the jail on the edge of town a new
jailer greeted them and answered
alices request

  sure you can see him we dont
stand for any nonsense but we give
a prisoner a square deal theres
outlaws of cahco hole



a change you see and al brought
it about if hed been an honest
citizen id ibet even money a jury
would call it self-defense but be-
ing one of sanchezs men makes a
difference here he is you can
talk to him through the bars

   alice started to run forward then
checked the impulse

   go ahead sally she whispered

  al drew sallys slender arms
through the bars and she slipped
them around his neck their lips
met and low words passed between
them chris came over after a while
and shook hands al caught his
breath chriss presence was almost
too much for him

  with you backing my hand al-
ice and dan stuart in the play i
cant lose al said with confidence

   did dan say hed get you out of
this alice cried sharply

   thats the impression he gave
id never-hang-for beasleys
death what dan says goes with
me he added

  now tell us what happened
alice insisted

   beasley saw me i offered to sur-
render then i saw by his eyes he
was going to kill me and call it self-
defense so i let him have it i had
to al concluded

  thats the way it must have
happened the jailer observed its
his story and hes sticking to it

al ford stuck to the story
when judge ritchie arrived

	and went into the case the
judge proved to be a mild little man
with silver hair and keen gray eyes
he had a habit of peering over the
top of his glasses at witnesses and
another habit of trapping those who
lied on the witness stand

   we will go over and look at the
exhibits in this case he informed
alice and sally the second day after

his arrival it is going to take more
than a mere statement that al killed 
in self-defense weve got to prove
it

  the exhibits consisted of the
weapons taken from al and the bul-
let removed from beasleys body

  this is the bullet ritchie
asked and this is the gun it came
from

  yes judge the prosecutor an-
swered

  and this is als gun the judge
inquired turning to alice

   yes of course the girl replied
then she looked closely and a pro-
test burst from her lips this is
not als gun at all its a gun ive
never seen before i swear it see
the notch on the walnut butt plate
she pressed her hand to her mouth
and concentrated her thoughts
wait i have seen that gun be-
fore it is one sanchez gave dan
stuart when-

  when-what the prosecuting
attorney asked sharply

  alice had come within an ace of
saying when dan set out to rob
the wagon gap bank she choked
back the words and said calmly
when dan explained he needed a
gun

  ah yes the prosecutor mur-
mured

  judge ritchie said this is im-
portant miss ford it suggests that
perhaps al did not kill beasley after
all this dan stuart may have
made it appear the boy did the kill-
ing lets talk it over with him
ill do the querying if you please

   the judge hurried to the jail and
his movements were like a hounds
on a fresh scent

  al he said peering over the
tops of his glasses that wasnt your
gun that killed beasley

  surprise flashed over als face
then his emotions were neatly

masked as he sensed some one his
sister probably had identified the
weapon

  no thats not my gun he ad-
mitted its dan stuarts he
didnt like the balance and i did
so we traded several days before i
left the hole

  very interesting judge ritchie
drawled

  they left the jail and when a
safe distance from possible listeners
the judge said to alice

  your brother is lying he is
shielding somebody can it be this
dan stuart again his eyes peered
over the glasses are you keeping
anything from me

  dan robbed wagon gap bank
alice said he was disguised as an
old prospector and tricked the man
hunters into going out of town
she saw a glint of admiration come
into the judges eyes al went
along against my wishes to give dan
help if he needed it

  hm-m-m it is well you told
me but well not mention the rob-
bery at the trial otherwise if we are
given an acquittal on the self-defense
issue the state will hold al on the
grounds he aided in the bank rob-
bery this my dear girl is a com-
plicated case id like to talk to
stuart

  huh alice sniffed you
wont get anywhere with him hes
a queer person stubborn as a mule
i cant do a thing with him but
im not forgetting one thing al once
said he was telling me about dan
breaking jail and taking him along
dan risked his life again and again
that time and al said i owe him
my life its a debt ill never for-
get to pay 

  judge ritchie pulled thoughtfully
at his jaw many years as a trial
judge in western courts had taught

him a keen insight into men and
their motives

  and your al has decided to pay
the debt he said softly the boy
has set his jaw on the matter nor
dare we bring up the bank-robbing
affair i guess well have to fight
it along the lines hes insisting-he
killed beasley in self-defense

  the two girls exchanged helpless
glances but alice did not give up
hope she was all for law and or-
der and she hated violence prefer-
ring to build rather than tear down
but she had sanchezs promise that
he would release her brother by force
if need be on this she pinned her
hopes there was however the
disturbing possibility the prisoner if
found guilty might be immediately
removed to states prison and be-
yond sanchezs reach

  now whatll we do sally cried

  well just have to wait alice
answered and you must be pre-
pared to go wherever al goes-and
go in a hurry dont ask me any
more questions because i cant an-
swer them lets try and keep up
our courage until after the trial

c ourage ebbed and flowed
in the days that followed
judge ritchie worked on al
ford from various angles but he
could not induce him either by pleas
or threats to change his mind

  youre protecting an outlaw and
i know it the judge stormed the
day before the trial your cour-
age should be directed toward a
worthier object hang it boy dont
you realize the best im hoping for
is a life sentence

  thats the best im hoping for
al answered he could not tell him
of dans promise to see him through
his trouble but his faith never wa-
vered

  the trial was brief a jury of
outlaws of calico hole



grim texans listened attentively to
the evidence heard ritchies dra-
matic plea then prepared to retire
to the jury room

  how long will they be here
sally asked

  i cant tell you my girl ritchie
answered

  the men disappeared into a room
and the door was locked hours
passed and the judge and court of-
ficials disappeared the girls
waited endlessly refusing ritchies
invitation to have something to eat

  night fell and they returned to
the hotel at two oclock a knock
came at the door

its the clerk are you awake
how can we sleep sally cried
in anguish whats happened
the jurys reached a verdict
the clerk said and messengers have
been sent for the judge and the oth-
ers i thought youd like to know
thanks alice answered

  they leaped from bed and dressed
hurriedly on the street it was cold
their footsteps broke the silence of
night the stars hung bright and
low here and there a cat slunk
from view the lights were on in
some houses others having heard
the news were dressing

  the courtroom was filled when
they arrived with sleepy people
grouped along the walls the
judge stepped to the bench and the
jury was brought in alice searched
each face and learned nothing ex-
cept the men appeared tired as if
they had hotly argued

  the judge asked the foreman if a
verdict had been reached and the
latter said

  yes your honor

  he passed a slip of paper to the
clerk who gave it to the judge the
judge glanced briefly at it and said
read it mr clerk

  the clerk droned we the un-

dersigned jury do find albert ford
guilty of murder in the first degree
the room was silent except for
the ticking of a big clock and the
soft rustle of clothing then there
was a convulsive sob sally geary
crumpled to the floor and alice
thought of a hen quail hit by a
charge of shot she leaned down
and patted the girls shoulder but
kept her eyes on the judge

  albert ford stand up

  al got to his feet and faced the
judge he was tall and straight but
still underweight his eyes were
clear and his chin was up

  sally look alice whispered
you must get up

  yes the girl said she got to
her feet her face was like chalk
and she grasped alices arm for sup-
port

  look hes our man sally and
hes brave yes thats it hes
brave i must find something to
cling to or ill go crazy

  now sally was the stronger and
it was her arm that supported alice

  have you anything to say the
judge asked is there any reason
why sentence should not be passed
on you now

  none your honor al said
evenly

  but there is something for you
to say al alice clawed her way
through others and grasped als arm
this is your last chance al speak
up and tell everything

  the judge leaned slightly forward
his eyes intent ritchie removed his
glasses and said

  speak al youve shielded him
long enough

  albert ford is there any reason
why sentence should not be passed
on you now the judge repeated

  none your honor al said
again then he faltered moistened
his lips and repeated none


street  smiths western story magazine

  it is the judgment of this courl
that you be taken to the state peni-
tentiary and there on the thirtieth
day of this month be hanged by the
neck until dead-dead-dead his
voice echoed against the walls al
stared beyond the judge to the stars
he seemed like one in a trance
and may god have mercy on your
soul

  the deputy sheriff gently pushed
alice and sally aside as the prosecu-
tor said

  your honor in view of sanchezs
outlaws and the fact the defendant
is a member of the band i suggest
he be taken immediately to the peni-
tentiary i fear there may be some
attempt to rescue him

  the judge frowned this court
yields to sanchez or no one else
the usual procedure will follow he
thundered angered at the mere sug-
gestion of danger from sanchez
court is adjourned the gavel
banged

  outside it was dark and cold
the two girls walked slowly toward
the hotel arm in arm and after a
while alice spoke

  be ready to go anywhere with
al sally she said anywhere-
any time they entered the lobby
run upstairs and go to bed-im
going to write a letter she seated
herself at a desk and wrote a note
to pedro sanchez and one to dan
stuart

chapter ix

texas rangers

an indian boy brought the two
notes to the barbed wire in

	calico hole where the guard
held him and sent for sanchez the
outlaw el mudo and dan came
down to the wire the former ac-
cepted the notes glanced briefly at

the envelope addressed to dan and
said

   this is yours its from alice
and therell foe no answer go back
to your caibin

   the outlaw leader opened his own
message and read

 pedro sanchez

   al sentenced to hang the thirtieth
 he will be taken away sometime after
 the twenty-second come and get us
 before then	alice

   sanchez smiled softly then his
eyes narrowed i shall borrow from
stuarts plan and arrange to divert
a few man hunters he sent back
to his cabin for paper and envelopes
he wrote the first note to alice it
read

mr darling

    i shall not fail you and will strike
 when the time is ripe your pedro

   see that the lady gets this he
 directed the indian boy he then
 wrote a second note

 my darling alice

   i shall attack the wagon gap jail
 in force some time on the twentieth
 and rescue al please be ready to
 leave with me at that time

pedro sanchez

   he gave this also to the native
 boy tell the deputy sheriff at
 wagon gap a strange man gave you
 this and the man looked like he
 might foe one of the sanchez band
 ask him what to do about it i am
 sure he will read it sanchez smiled
 and gave the boy a twenty-dollar
 bill go and dont mix up the
 letters

   dan stuarts letter was brief and
 carried a sting

dear dan

   they are going to hang al on the
 thirtieth throughout the trial his

ws-b
outlaws of calico hole



  courage was perfect and his lips re-
  mained closed when by opening them
  he could have found freedom and hap-
  piness with as brave a girl as ever
  breathed even though he would not
  talk i can read between the lines
  your gun in evidence helped i want
  you to know he is discharging his debt
  to you in full	alice ford

 dan read the letter over several
times and found no comfort be-
tween the lines he saddled jerry
and rode around the hole staring
with unseeing eyes at the falls the
rich pasture land and the orderly
fences dividing cattle and horses
a debate raged within his breast
but in the end he shook his head
negatively no its too late to
turn back now happiness for me
if any is ahead if i come through
the raid on el rios bank alive the
trail will be easier i should drag
ten thousand out of the affair-
maybe more i can do a lot on ten
thousand

 as the twentieth drew near san-
chez said nothing of the proposed
ride to el rio which lay forty miles
over the mountains on the morn-
ing of the nineteenth dan awak-
ened to find only a handful of out-
laws at breakfast the others had
disappeared during the night he
asked no questions but he walked
out to the corral after dark and eyed
jerry speculatively youre a good
horse jerry and sometimes i think
you know it and take pride in it
he fed the horse some sugar i
think well be in action soon
sanchezs cabin was dark when he
returned and dan crawled into his
own bunk to sleep or if he could
not sleep to review the exciting
events of the past few weeks at
three oclock sanchez awakened him

  get up he ordered were rid-
ing

 together they went down to the
corral some of the horses were
ws-b

standing close together others were
down in the pasture sanchez roped
two one for himself and the other
for el mudo

  whats the matter why arent
you saddling the outlaw leader
asked sharply

  cant find jerry

  take another horse then san-
chez shot a glance at the rim of the
hole first thing we know itll be
daylight

  dan roped a strong horse and sad-
dled it el mudo was waiting for
them at the big cabin he vaulted
into the saddle and jerked and
spurred his spirited animal into sub-
mission sanchez seemed to be un-
dergoing a change each moment as
the tiger in the man always close
to the surface revealed itself

  were riding to el rio he told
dan you lead the way

 with your guns on my back
dan thought you dont trust me
yet well its mutual-i dont trust
you either

they were over the mountains
by daybreak and could see
the twinkling lights of el rio
in the valley by ten oclock they
had approached the outskirts of the
town over a seldom-used road

  sanchez halted my men sifted
into the town yesterday one at a
time theyre cowboys in town for
a good time and are stopping at the
different rooming places we swing
into action at eleven oclock any-
body on the street who gets in the
way will be killed understand
yes

  sanchez was the complete tiger
now tense alert and snarling
when a texas ranger attacks a
man in a gun fight he kills him in
his mind the instant he lays eyes
on him his natural shooting in-
stincts do the rest thats what


street  smiths western story magazine

youre to do stuart sanchez ex-
plained

  sure

  this is your test if you run
out well drop you in your tracks
the only thing i ever run out
of was the wagon gap jail dan
retorted i figure to cut in to the
tune of ten thousand on this deal
watch me sanchez ill be around
you drift across the street from
the bank sanchez went on drill
anybody who comes around either
corner of the building the rest of
the boys know what to do without
orders-theyve been through this
before

  so have i dan retorted

  el mudos glittering eyes were
studying dan searching for some-
thing on which he could lay the fin-
ger of suspicion the man was in-
variably nervous inwardly at such
times outwardly he was nerveless
and followed his companions code
-kill when in the slightest doubt

  therell be a deputy sheriff loaf-
ing around somewhere sanchez
concluded ill take care of him
dan rode ahead and he noticed
sanchez and el mudo remained to-
gether the former again leaning on
the dumb ones sensitive instincts to
the slightest danger a deer stalked
by a mountain lion could not have
been more alert

  el rio was like a hundred other
southwestern communities--a main
street on which stood the more sub-
stantial buildings with humble
structures sandwiched in between
several intersecting streets made a
brave effort to carry on the towns
growth but trailed into dust and
were lost on the brush pressing in
on all sides

  dan followed one of the intersect-
ing streets and turned the corner
into the main thoroughfare

  quite a few strangers in town

t-day an old fellow remarked to
a companion you might think the
texas rangers was sneakin into
camp-thats the way they trickle
in

  the other chuckled any rang-
ers in these parts are over to wagon
gap fixin to surprise sanchez
seems like an injun boy give a note
that he was supposed to pack to al
fords sister to the deputy danged
if it didnt tell about a rescue san-
chez has rid to his last fight the
old man concluded

  you dont say the other ex-
claimed thats where our boys
must be-over there lendin a hand

 dan grinned so sanchez had
borrowed his trick of ridding a com-
munity of man hunters hes be-
ginning to appreciate my real
worth he mused well heres the
bank and therere a couple of the
band one was examining his
horses hoof the other searching his
pocket for a match to light a ciga-
rette a clock in the bank showed
five minutes to eleven five long
minutes to wait dan said then
men will die

he looked into a store window
briefly then walked down to
the corner and lighted a
cigarette it was eleven oclock
when he returned to his place oppo-
site the bank sanchez was saun-
tering toward it el mudo was com-
ing from the other direction and
suddenly the air was charged el
mudo slowed up sufficiently to per-
mit sanchez to enter the bank ahead
of him no recognition passed be-
tween them but the dumb one was
five feet behind his chief when they
reached the tellers cage

  how about cashing this san-
chez softly suggested and dan saw
him hand the teller the sheet of pa-
per which stated on the twentieth
outlaws of calico hole



there would be a hundred thousand
dollars available in the el rio bank

  why faltered the teller we
never wrote wagon gap any such
letter we dont owe them a dime
his hands were in the air and he
began to talk fast

  el mudos instincts warned him
and a horrible cry came from his
throat it was the first sound dan
had heard him utter and it was
wrenched from him by a sudden re-
alization of dire peril coupled with
a madness to kill everything in his
path

  kill stuart sanchez snarled
then he leaped through a side win-
dow he was running when his
boots touched the ground and el
mudo came behind him el mudos
hand flashed and dan saw the flame
spurt from the muzzle of his 
and a bullet creased his shoulder

  so its one of us dan cried and
he ran toward the dumb one whose
gun was spurting lead sanchez was
cutting in at one side trying to save
himself from gunfire and at the same
time reach his horse his deadly
eyes roved his lips snapped orders
to his men who were pouring from
near-by structures ready to shoot
their way clear

  el mudo dropped a gun and drew
a second from his holster his rage
was disturbing his aim and as yet
dan had not fired he was running
toward the dumb one further to
shatter his nerve retreat would
have meant instant death for he
had seen el mudo shoot on occasion

  a hundred feet from the man
dans gun cracked and el mudos
arms went back as if he were
stretching he shuddered from head
to foot then his face twisting into
a snarl he tried to bring the gun
to bear once more-to kill one more
man and that one the man he be-
lieved had tricked him into a trap

  dan did not fire again he knew
a second shot would not be neces-
sary and there was still sanchez to
reckon with and he did not know
how many others three of the
outlaws ran down an alley only to
return running low and yelling
texas rangers

  a voice shouted surrender or
well wipe you out

  it was a voice that filled half the
town and only one man in the
southwest had one like it-tex
crawford who had been in the
rangers since he was a youngster
one of the outlaws dropped his gun
and thrust his hands into the air
tex turned and the man went for
a seconds gun like a flash tex
whirled and fired the outlaw
pitched onto his face in the street

  dan slunk along a wall raced
across an open spot and leaped into
the saddle a gun cracked and he
almose fell to the ground but set-
ting his teeth and grasping the sad-
dle horn he managed to stay up
his heels went into his horses
flanks

  light out boy he shouted and
the animal responded

  a half block away sanchez was
running beside his frightened horse
trying to mount and make his es-
cape

  get back he snarled at dan
dont draw their fire this way
sanchez you cant get away
you havent a chance the rangers
have surrounded el rio and jud
tremper is here to accept your invi-
tation for a show-down hes here
to settle with you for killing his
brother

  sanchezs horse reared and went
down as a bullet struck it the
raider got clear with a tigerish spring
and dived into the brush dan
jumped from his horse as a six-gun


street  smiths western story magazine

just ahead spurted lead and fol-
lowed sanchez

  i know you now the outlaw

snarled i-

 yes you know me now san-
chez dan retorted his eyes were
flaming-matching the killing light
reflected in sanchezs eyes each
was following the rangers creed-
to kill the enemy in your mind as
you attack

  sanchez was never more deadly
than at that moment his gun
roared and the bullet went true-
dust puffed from the front and back
of dans shirt he almost went
down but his gun steadied he
checked the sagging knees and fired
sanchezs face turned gray then a
horrible red he set his teeth and
went down

  whats next dan said thickly

whats-

  darkness rushed on him like a
thundercloud his ears roared then
he was lost in the blackness far
away a voice whispered

  dangedest fight i ever seed-
each got the other

when dan stuart opened
his eyes a doctor was
bending over him and
shaking his head as he ordered
dont try to talk

  telegraph governor and tell him
to pardon-al ford dan gasped
i killed-beasley he was one of
sanchezs men im dan-stuart
the doctor said to several others
in the room you heard that this
man confesses to killing beasley
he looked back at dan dont
worry well telegraph the governor
at once

  blackness came to dan again but
far away he heard voices and one
said

  biggest clean-up the rangers

ever made-got every member of
the sanchez gang including this fel-
low thieves fell out i guess and
they settled it with six-guns lessn a
hundred feet apart

 another voice came fainter
well operate but it wont do any
good

  the darkness did not last forever
and finally dan saw sunlight he
looked at two wasted hands and saw
that they were his he tried to
lift one but it was too heavy
ive been sick he whispered
youve been dead for a week
tex crawford boomed they had
to do some work on you boy and
doc mustve done a good job be-
cause hes all puffed up over the
fact youve pulled through

  and still enough of a doctor to
worry over my patient the doctor
cut in go to sleep

  dan slept and when he awakened
lips lightly touched his forehead a
small hand was lifting his giving it
warmth and strength from the con-
tact

  alice he whispered without
opening his eyes

  yes alice the girl said in a
low shaky tone you didnt fail
al did you my darling you con-
fessed to killing beasley and saved
him

  yes id have done it sooner
but i had to take part in this raid
-ten thousand dollars is a lot of
money he spoke slowly and with
an effort besides i knew if he
was in jail he couldnt ride with
sanchez and get killed

  and he would have been killed
dan alice cried the rangers
gave the band a chance to surrender
but it meant hanging to be caught
so they tried to shoot their way out
thats twice youve saved als life
the governor says als slate is wiped
outlaws of calico hole



clean so he is going to marry sally
on the fifteenth of next month
theyre going to get the twin f
back again and run it as four genera-
tions of fords have done

  and you he asked

  ill wait until youve served your
term whatever it is dan then well
be married there couldnt be any-
body but you-ever my darling
she said

  serve what term tex craw-
ford bellowed my gosh girl do
you think hes an outlaw dog my
cats but i dont know what the
younger generation is coming to-
a girl marrying a man without know-
ing who he is

  why should that make a differ-
ence

  it makes a whale of a difference
this time this cuss tried to rob
wagon gap bank and heres why
he wanted to be arrested thrown
in jail with al ford so al could get
him into the sanchez gang as a re-
ward for pulling off the jail break
crawford explained

  yes thats clear enough alice
said

  dan needed ten thousand bucks
to develop a ranch hes had in mind
a long time crawford continued
and sanchez offered one way of
getting it everything went along
fine except he had to actually rob
the bank in order to win sanchezs
confidence so that later he might be
tricked into leaving calico hole and
thus give the rangers a fair chance
at him

  thats clear now alice an-
swered

  and so this here chump writes
another glorious page in ranger his-
tory then ups and quits the outfit
so he can marry a girl and invest
ten thousand reward money in de-
veloping calico hole into calico
ranch crawford boomed

  dan she cried you are a

texas ranger then- many

things were clear now chiefly that
this man had guarded her brother
throughout at the risk of his own
life but if im not going to be
mrs dan stuart who am i to be
why bless youre little heart
tex replied youre going to be mrs
jud tremper wife of the ranger
who spent his vacation avenging his
brothers murder

  mrs jud tremper she said
softly 

  sounds nice dont it crawford
suggested heres the check for
ten thousand dollars for sanchez
dead or alive whatll i do with it
give it to alice mr jud trem-
per said shell get it as soon as
were married anyway besides
she earned it a long while back it
was one night in calico hole my
brothers mare recognized me and
came up to the fence i slapped
her and alice saw the whole affair
she knew that mare connected me
with my real identity but she not
only let me play my hand through
she turned the mare loose and re-
lieved me of a menace that might
have betrayed me to sanchez

range for you could get away with
that and those weaners that was
lifted right out of the foothill pas-
ture with us boys sleepin only half
a mile away no thief that come
in from outside could figure things
so close well you can see what i
mean somebody on the crosstree
is playin double

  dont you suppose snapped
schraber ive known that all

along and youre suggesting that
bascom parr is the man stuff and
nonsense balderdash tommy-
rot

  but its since he came here that

things begun goin real bad-

  call him in i told you

  lafe hunt stepped to the door
the broad wings of his chaps flop-
ping as he walked giving an added
swagger to his gait

  hey there parr he yelled
come in here the boss wants
you

abroad shadow moved
across the doorsill in the
august sunlight then the
opening was filled both as to height
and width and a gentle voice asked
you wanta see me boss

  six feet above the floor mild blue
eyes looked down at the rancher
the face of bascom parr was fair
and round curly straw-colored
hair rioted above a smooth forehead
and a sensitive mouth and square
chin completed the face

  he looked thought old schraber
to himself about as much like a vil-
lain as a cherub on a pink cloud
but the rancher was troubled and
this small irritation piled upon all
the rest was just that much too
much yes and hunt seemed to
mean what he said and he was the
only man on the place capable of
carrying on in the owners absence
still schraber wanted to dodge the
issue if possible so he inquired
tartly

  whats this i hear about your
breaking up the bunk house
bascom looked reproachfully at
hunt and stubbed his boot toe on
the threshold as he moved into the
room

  i didnt go to do it boss the
slats on them bunks aint much

force anyhow theyre plumb full
o knots

  well growled schraber still
dodging a show-down get back out
there and fix up that door you tore
off the hinges and- wait a min-
ute bascom i-damn it i dont
like to tell you kid but i guess
we wont need you any more you
see the rancher explained hastily
avoiding the young fellows eyes
ive just got to cut down on ex-
penses ill give you a coupla weeks
extra wages and you can easy land
you another job this time of year
the enormous bulk of bascom
parr turned blindly toward the door
he stumbled into a small table that
was loaded with books and papers
the cowboy clutched at the table
to keep it from going over and blun-
dered against an old-fashioned coat-
and-hat rack standing near the door
the resulting crash shook the house

  bascom dazedly arose and freed
himself of debris and schraber
hands clenched yelled

  get out get out you club-
footed elephant you dont stop to
pick those things up get out

  the face of the rancher was white
with wrath-and shame the
youths stricken look but schraber
was a badly worried man things
had been piling up pretty fast on
him lately he was not one bit sure
that he would be able to get the ex-
tension on his paper which he was
going down to the county seat to
ask for to-morrow and this mys-
terious stealing that was sapping his
herds-he had been baffled in every
effort to solve it and the money
he had expected from natchez
county-that had not come he
knew very well that charley elden
who owned the general store at
natchez junction would have sent
the money if he had been able to
collect it charley had taken sev-

eral small herds of horses and one
large herd of cattle which belonged
to schraber to sell on commission
in natchez county but collections
were always tough in that sparsely
settled region when a man had a
muddle like that on his mind what
was one overgrown cowboy more or
less

  bascom didnt bother about the
bunk-house door he didnt bother
about his check he rolled together
his meager possessions caught and
saddled his one horse--a big bay
with enough bottom to carry his
masters avoirdupois-and took the
southward road away from the
crosstree ranch his heart a hard
choking lump that had stuck square
in the middle of his throat

  for the crosstree wasnt just an-
other ranch to bascom parr it
wasnt merely a place to put his
feet under the table and draw his
pay slip every month it was a
shrine at which bascom had wor-
shiped from afar long before cir-
cumstance had permitted him to
visit it to the gigantic gentle-
hearted cowboy the short-tempered
shriveled snapping schraber was
not an unjust and an ungenerous
boss

when bascom looked at the
little rancher he did not
see a cranky and worried
old man what he really saw was
the hero of shawnee creek remem-
bering a page out of western his-
tory that the stockman himself and
most of the rest of the world had
forgotten how lew schraber
young and flashing and gay had
saved the settlers along shawnee
creek from a furious indian attack
how with four six-shooters and
twenty pounds of ammunition and
a daring that was little short of mad-
ness he had made a flank attack
cowboy samson



upon the stalking redmen had de-
coyed them out of the creek bot-
tom making them think in the
blackness of a windy spring night
that he was a small but effective
fighting force how he had led them
over ridge and gulch and down tim-
ber until his hat was shot from his
head and his horse shot from under
him how with two bullets in him
and his last four rounds of shells he
had crawled around to their rear
while they were hunting him and
demoralized them completely by a
new and ferocious attack and how
shawnee creek had lived in peace
thereafter

  it was a wild story and people
living in safe snug homes didnt be-
lieve it and remarked what impossi-
ble tales came out of the west and
where would anybody get all that
ammunition anyhow but bascom
had an uncle very old now who had
been one of the shawnee creek set-
tlers and he knew that every word
of the tale was true young lew
schraber had been bringing in a
freight load of supplies when he saw
the indians coming in the dusk he
had broken open a crate of small
arms then flung upon a lead horse
the saddle which most freighters
carried for rounding up their graz-
ing stock

  yes bascom knew the truth of it
all he slumped dejectedly in his
saddle as his broncho plodded across
the alkali flats that stretched south
to the rolling grass lands of indio
county ever since he could re-
member he had dreamed of the day
when he would get him a job with
the heroic lew schraber and now
because of lafe hunt he had lost it

  bascom wondered miserably why
hunt had it in for him the cow-
boy had long realized that his size
and strength were a handicap in the
only work he liked to do he could

not seem to learn how to handle
his unwelcome endowments he
threw his rope too far and drove his
spurs too deep and burned a brand
too long he always sat back on a
lariat too hard and fast-hed lost
track of the number of bovine necks
hed broken-and he could not join
in the rough-house play of the ranch
hands for fear of crippling some-
body

  bascom cursed his superhuman
strength and watched with lack-
luster eyes a rider coming across the
flats at a steady jog a voice came
through the white heat rousing
him

 hello there bascom you
asleep in your saddle

  the gaze of the cowboy cleared
well duke jones if it aint you
whered you drop from

  natchez county replied the
other with laconic brevity duke
jones had not been so named be-
cause of any pretentions to titled
rank but from the fact that he had
a pair of very efficient fists he was
a dark man rather under medium
height with a seamed weather-bit-
ten face a pair of inscrutable eyes
and an enviable reputation he was
a dead shot he was entirely fearless
and utterly honest the hero-wor-
shiping bascom admired him in-
tensely

  duke asked bluntly what you
headed in this direction for lookin
like the day after the big wind

  i just got fired bascom ex-
plained picking at the brads on his
saddle horn to hide his eyes
schraber fire you

  yep

  what for duke pursued get-
ting out a battered slab of very
black plug cut have a chew
no thanks makes me sick
because my feet are all clubs and
my fingers are all thumbs


street  smiths western story magazine

  aw dont feel bad aibout it kid
the old mans just got a mad on
hell get over it you go back in
four five days and hell never know
he fired you

  bascom shook his head and asked
absently what you packin all
that hardware for

  the eyes of duke jones narrowed
how do you know what im pack-
in

  see it was the reply you got
a gun under your arm and one in
your belt besides that cannon on
your hip

  duke swore softly youre an
observin cuss a lotta fellers has
seen me since i started for here and
id gamble that none of em suspi-
cioned that i was wearin moren one
pistol you see im also wearin
close to four thousand in gold and
paper

  bascoms face lighted say
you aint bringin up schrabers
money from charley elden are
you

  none but duke returned
charley has had the deuces own
time collectin for that stuff o
schrabers he sold down there it
come in in driblets mostly coin and
since their bank went bust he had
to send it as was so i hustled me
an arsenal and told charley id see
it through

  im sure glad its come said
bascom the old mans been get-
tin a darn tough break lately he
was startin down-country to-mor-
row to see about an extension on his
loan

  duke jones rubbed a stubbled
chin thoughtfully youre a rum
bird a guy up and busts you and
youre tickled pink when you hear
hes had a little luck

bascom answered simply i
couldnt be sore at lew schraber
duke looked at him then turned

away his eyes thinking it was good
to know that there were still clean
things in the world presently he
said

  i kinda wish you was back on
that ranch kid

  why

  well i cant stop there to-night
i gotta go right on got a hurry-up
message to deliver at the hastings
place id feel easier if somebody
good and husky was left with schra-
ber and these spondulics

  youre afraid somebodyll lift
that money gosh duke no dan-
ger of that in this neck o the
woods

  no well some jasper has been
scoutin my trail all the way up here
i got two glimpses of him and i
doubled back and found some
tracks he dont seem to wanta
tackle me but hes follerin this
money or im a blame poor
guesser

  no need to worry said bascom
the old mans got a good safe
maybe was the dubious an-
swer but i dont like the look of
things just the same i got a hunch
that this guy thats been trailin me
is in cahoots with some one on the
ranch oh sure its all guess but
my guesses has been bulls-eyes too
many times for me to sniff at em
and i dont hardly like to mention
it to the old man because hes
jumpy enough as it is you wouldnt
consider goin back

  i cant said bascom thinking
of lafe hunt itll be all right
duke if you see it into the safe
well then so long and good
luck duke rode on

for another hour bascom
jogged stolidly across the
monotonous plain aiming for
a spring in a draw where he could
camp that night he had unsad-
cowboy samson



died and turned his horse loose to
graze when stooping to drink at the
spring his eye was caught iby some-
thing bright lying on the bushes
above

  bascom forgot the drink he
stared a moment then reached up
and plucked the bright object from
the bush where it had caught it
was a torn piece of a red-and-yellow
bandanna and the cowboy was
ready to swear that he knew where
it had come from the ranch wag
at the crosstree had brought a red-
and-yellow bandanna from town one
day and presented it with great
solemnity to lafe hunt to match
his plaid shirt

  hunt was sensitive about that
shirt but he was stubborn about
wearing it he also wore the ban-
danna just to show everybody how
little he cared for their opinion of
his taste a few days ago the donor
of the handkerchief had demanded
to know what had become of his
gift hunt had replied to the vast
hilarity of the other cowboys that
he had lost it

  bascom sat cross-legged on the
ground looking at the thing the
sight of it seemed to have turned a
switch in his brain numerous re-
mote items flashed across his mem-
ory scattered and fragmentary
items they were and yet they had
a curious order now that his mind
had struck their track a man had
been following duke jones maybe
a man who had met lafe hunt here
at this spring hunt had made a
trip over into indio county a few
days ago to look at some year-
lings indio county lay next to
natchez county there had been
other times when hunt was absent
from the ranch all plausibly ex-
plained and all those hints of his
about the stealing being an inside

job that there was some snake on
the crosstree

  by golly thought bascom i
wonder who that snake is im be-
ginning to think that hunt has
likely got the answer behind his
vest wonder why i never thought
of these things before i never did
cotton much to hunt but the old
man seemed to think he was all
right and i guess i dont look very
close at what the old man approves
hunts a crackin good cowhand
and he has a way with him when
he wants to use it then too i
may be all wrong but i wish duke
was goin to stay there with that
money to-night maybe id oughta
go back like he said i could be
there just in case

  bascom pondered the question
while he consumed two hard bis-
cuits and a can of beans by the
flickering light of a sagebrush fire
he didnt want to go back and
this was all just guesswork and
likely a mile off the right track any-
way still he could lie up on the
hillside above the bunk house and
not show himself unless something
happened

  bascom because of the size and
strength which kept him out of
fights had never been suspected of
a deep aversion to battle in any
form he didnt think it was fear-
he hoped that it wasnt fear-but
the cowboy had a stronge distaste
for contention and angry words his
was a peace-loving soul he liked
to be friendly with people and when
he could not be he wanted to get
clear out of their vicinity

prone on the ground half doz-
ing bascom suddenly lifted
his head a door had creaked
the lights in both bunk house and
ranch house had been out for an
hour for a few minutes he heard


street  smiths western story magazine

nothing more then there came to
his ears the muffled sound of horses
hoofs a figure moved out from the
bunk house toward the corrals bas-
com slid quietly down the slope be-
hind the building and crouched at
one corner to listen he could hear
the snores of two or three of the
sleeping cowboys inside near the
big corral there was the creak of
leather and the sound of men shift-
ing their weight from saddle to
ground

  by golly thought bascom
sounds like an army i might let
a yell outta me and nip the whole
thing in the bud right here but if
i did wed never know who it was
come outta that bunk house

  four shapes materialized from
the shadows and a blurred whisper
was giving orders one of the shapes
took position by the bunk-house
door the other three moved si-
lently toward the ranch house
when they were out of sight bas-
com took up his station beneath
schrabers bedroom window the
safe was in the living room one end
of which served as ranch office
bascom reasoned that schraber
would be wakened and made to open
it maybe the old man could bluff
them out somehow the plain fact
was that the cowboy was casting
about in his mind for some way to
stop this thing without a fight

  schrabers window lighted and
his voice sounded sudden and quer-
ulous

 whats this whats this
what-the-devil-

  a hoarse voice said gag him
quick fore he can yell there
now old man get your slippers on
and come and open up that safe for
us and you mights well come
quiet and easy you wont get hurt
if you show pretty manners oh
want your dressin gown huh my

what a lotta style you rich guys do
put on there you are come
along now

  bascom quickly changed his posi-
tion to the front door keeping well
out of sight of the guard at the bunk
house through a window near the
door he could see the group enter
the living room one of three masked
men carrying a lamp the other two
leading schraber firmly gripped by
the arms his mouth gagged with a
blue handkerchief

  the eyes of the old rancher were
blazing his glance shooting about
him canvassing every possibility of
escape but for once in his fire-
eating life lew schraber was help-
less still thought the watching
bascom he might figure something
out yet he might fool with the
combination of the safe act as if
he couldnt work it

  that apparently was just what
schraber was doing squatted on
the floor his bony bare ankles show-
ing above his slippers he worked at
the combination for two three four
minutes one of the masked figures
growled

  the old four-flusher is stallin on
us boys

  a booted toe shot out and planted
itself in the old mans short ribs
he toppled over with an involun-
tary moan

  bascom had wrenched the door
open and was halfway across the
room before his first conscious
thought came to him the group
before the safe had whirled drag-
ging at their guns they fired but
their aim was poor he was already
on top of them he picked up the
first man he encountered and hurled
him across the room the fellow
had some difficulty separating him-
self from a demolished chair

  bascom put out a foot and tripped
the second man and met the third
cowboy samson



head on this one dived under his
arms and clung like a leech yelling
get him get him

one of bascoms hamlike fists
inserted itself under the chin
that was digging into his
ribs opened and then closed long
fingers around the scrawny neck
the next second the man was claw-
ing for freedom and yelling for help

  help was coming the other two
swarmed over the cowboy not dar-
ing to shoot except at close range
for fear of getting their comrade
bascom wouldnt stay put long
enough he set his boot heel on a
toe and there was a shriek of pain
as the leech at last tore himself
loose the cowboy grabbed off the
mask schrabers voice yelled

  i can identify that one kid un-
cover the others

  there was an instant stampede
for the door the unmasked man
got away but bascom threw one of
the others with his foot and hooked
a hand in the collar of the third
as he tore this mask away he heard
the sound of shooting at the bunk
house the guard there was evi-
dently trying to hold the aroused
men inside

  get the other one kid croaked
schraber his voice crackling with
excitement he had torn off the gag
at once and was now looking for
an opening to run in but bascom
was moving much too fast for any
chance of help

  as the man he had tripped rolled
across the floor the cowboy
snatched the gun of the fellow he
had just unmasked he tossed the
weapon to schraber and tossed the
owner after it

  the rancher chuckled dryly and
said seems to me i fired you for
drinkin two years ago smitty

  smitty sat very quiet under his
own gun muzzle

  the last man had made a desper-
ate break for the door bascom
knew who he was by the way he
moved the cowboy got one finger
in the belt of the flying form it
was hard on the finger but it did
the work the next moment un-
masked and cursing like a madman
lafe hunt was struggling furiously
in the grasp of the cowboy he had
had fired only a few hours before
bascom took him by the scruff of
the neck and the belt and faced
him around toward schraber

  ever see this before he asked
joyfully

  grim and astonished the rancher
stared what a lame-brain i
turned out to be he said bitterly

 and i think added bascom
that this hunk o coyote bait was
plannin to lay the robbery onto me
is the reason he had you fire me to-
day

  a voice spoke from the doorway
i come back as quick as i could
but i cant sees im much needed

  duke jones came into the room
methodically poking before him the
robber that bascom had first un-
masked

 the rest o the boys duke
jones said has got another guy out
there they said was shooting holes
in their door and theyre askin him
some kinda personal questions about
it schraber he said eying the
sullen-faced lafe hunt dont you
reckon that this about explains your
mysterious cattle rustlin

  the old man nodded slowly he
looked around the wrecked room
not one piece of furniture in it ex-
cepting the safe had escaped the
hurricane then he looked at the
wrecker a smile in his deep eyes

  some man was his only com-
ment


street  smiths western story magazine

  bascom spoke quickly look
boss i wanta show you stand up
there hunt boss i just found out
how to do it look

  he let go a terrific haymaker at
hunts jaw the man dodged with
a yell of fright but at that he
would not have moved quickly
enough if bascoms giant fist hadnt
stopped within a half inch of the
bristled chin arm still in the air
the cowboy looked around at schra-
ber and grinned

  see that dyou get it look
he snatched up lafe hunt as if
the man had been a rag doll and
swung him arm length overhead
hunt completely demoralized
screamed with terror the body
hurled downward and the specta-
tors gasped but it stopped within
a foot of the floor checked smoothly
by perfectly timed muscles bas-
com released it gently and hunt

rolled out of reach eyes distended
jaw slack

  duke jones was watching with
narrowed glittering gaze he was
a man who could appreciate such a
performance bascom laughed hap-

pily

  see boss i can handle myself
now ive always hated fights when
all the time the only thing i needed
was a fight to learn how to use my
strength i bet i dont bust up any
more bunks or pitchfork handles
and-bascom hesitated and
blushed-about the-the rest of it
boss if im ever half the man the
guy was who saved shawnee creek
from a scalpin ill be moren satis-
fied

  the old eyes of lew schraber
stared into the young ones a min-
ute and understanding flooded over
him his gun hand dropped limply

  well ill be dog-goned said

a foot taller than his red-headed
partner a flip of the head carried the
jaw beyond reach

  yah poke jeered missed me

  ill cut you down to my size
hard-rock shrilled driving his fist
into pokes stomach as poke
doubled up hard-rock nailed him
on the jaw pokes eyes glazed his
knees sagged then his long arms
grasped hard-rocks solid figure and
held on together they crashed to
the floor

  slugging kneeing and occasion-
ally indulging in a little mild thumb
gouging they rolled the length of
the room

  look out for the stove poke
warned

  the devil with the stove hard-
rock snarled

  they crashed into the stove
knocked it off its legs and brought
the pipe down with it two years
accumulation of soot filled the room
hard-rocks hair turned black his
face became an inky smear and
when he sneezed soot eddied vio-
lently by mutual agreement they
broke apart and opened the door to
let the smoke and soot out

mort seeley hearing the
uproar arrived as they re-
newed the battle seeley
liked beer and comfort he was
built accordingly with a moon face
and a stomach as round as a globe

  gentlemen gentlemen he ad-

knee in hard-rocks stomach

  this was the signal for seeley to
hop into the fight im going to
have peace in these parts if i have
to fight for it he roared now cut
it out he hurled himself between
them and something had to give
under the impact of his great weight

  this is a private fight hard-
rock shouted come on poke lets
have at him

 they swarmed over seeley
mauled him and hurried the well-
intentioned fat man from the cabin
as they renewed the fight seeley
broke into a trot which carried him
to big nugget in fifteen minutes
he went straight to the united
states marshals office and asked for
dad morton marshal of the dis-
trict

  hes out a clerk informed him

  the chechahco kids two hun-

wooden stairs leading to the second
floor in moccasins and parka he
suggested some swift-moving fur-

better rough-and-tumble fighter in

  he broke into a run which carried
him to the fight within five minutes
he got a leg which happened to be-
long to poke tupper and pulled
as hard-rocks fist was buried in
pokes hair the little sourdough
came along too

let go dang it poke groaned
my hairs cornin out by the roots
bud dragged them through the

bank

  now cool off he admonished
as fast as you start fighting ill
throw you back

  the two circled and considered
their chances against the best man
either had ever seen in action

  itll be fightin the law any-

out

  dont let that stop you bud
countered removing his deputy
marshals shield

  there was a silence-a silence

paved with good intentions

  bud knew men and he knew this
stubborn pair was determined to
split ive done my best he said
youre crazy both of you and

being drowned or lost in a glacier
crevasse in the iron mountain
country just remember if youd
have stuck together blazed a good

trail-

  ill blaze the trail myself poke

rock shouted you dont cheat me

tered ive got just as much right

they heaped their belongings
on the table in the center of
the cabin and stacked several
bales of fur-their winters catch-
against the wall

  silver fox eh bud observed
worth about eighty dollars a skin
at the fur exchange in seattle how
many have you got

  fifty hard-rock answered
four thousand dollars bud
mused and with that much
money the two of you could prospect
the iron mountain country blaze a
trail and make the way easy for a
lot of old fellows who havent had
the luck youve had

  no answer

  he divided their belongings to the
last knife and fork each getting
twenty-five pelts now how about
the table shall you cut cards
for it

  naw cut it in two poke an-
swered ill put a couple more
legs on my half he produced a
saw and cut the table in half

  how about tabasco the mush-
ing mule-going to cut him up
bud inquired

  neither partner looked at the
other

 ill take the upper half of
tabasco hard-rock snapped
thats the part that carries the
load he added softly

  give me the legs poke said
with a curious gleam in his eyes
and ill be satisfied

  that leaves this cabin bud

went on now-

 cut it in two hard-rock
directed ill take the end with the
stovepipe and he can have the end
with the door-or other way around
weve got an extra stove so therell 
be no trouble about stoves

  without a word poke stalked over
to seeleys cabin and said

  id like to borrow that long cross-
cut saw

  fools seeley snorted go
help yourself-youre cutting up the
cabin i suppose the saw was
eight feet long and used only on
very thick logs and timbers

  yeah poke answered its a
real split-up this time everything
divided

  how about iron mountain
ill blaze a trail my gosh he
added truculently youd think i
cant get along without hard-rock
youre a great team the best i
know seeley answered and iron
mountain country is a two-man job
any time

  not for me it isnt poke cried
anything hard-rock and i can do
together i can do single-handed
poke was ordinarily modest but the
present situation had aroused him to
recklessness he balanced the saw
on his shoulder and trudged back to
the cabin the free end of the saw
swaying up and down with each
step

  hard-rock was waiting for him on
the roof he had drawn a line in
the exact middle of the structure
they began at the peak of the roof
and worked through the shingles
until the cut was too wide for the
length of the saw then hard-rock
removed his handle thrust the saw
blade through the cut climbed
down went inside attached the
handle and thereafter worked his
end from the interior

  in about two hours they had com-
pleted the cut from ridge pole to
foundation each moved his share
of their belongings into his half

  im goin to hang blankets over
the open end so i cant see you
poke tupper declared

  yeah well im goin to put up
a log wall so i wont hear you
siphonin your coffee hard-rock
trail pardners



retorted he caught up an ax and
headed for the nearest trees which
would supply logs of the desired size

bud tuttle loafed around
speculating on a means of
bringing the cantankerous old
fellows together knowing neither
would budge an inch from the stand
he had taken bud appreciated he
was attempting next to the im-
possible

  hard-rock cut his logs then
walked over to tabasco with a view
to harnessing him to a sled and
drawing the logs to the cabin the
mule regarded him with interest

  whoa you long-eared skate he
admonished stand still or ill lam
you

  hey whatre you doin with
that mule poke advanced in a
threatening manner

  i own the upper half of him
hard-rock answered standing his
ground and glaring i aim to
harness that half and work it he
grinned contemptuously put one
over on you didnt i

  hah-hah thats funny poke
jeered you just thought you did
i own the legs well you cant use
the upper half without payin me
plenty for using my half-the legs

  hard-rocks jaw fell why you

double-crossin black-hearted-

he began at that moment he
backed into tabascos heels and
the next instant was flying through
the air he struck the packed snow
with a thud and struggled to his feet
so you own the legs eh well the
legs damaged me just now and ill
sue you ill sue you for assault and
battery mental anguish and-and
anticipated profits he concluded
lamely

  poke threw back his head and
roared with laughter thats the
funniest thing i ever saw-you in

the air he slapped his leg and
doubled up

  tabasco realizing he could not
kick poke stretched his neck and
nipped the seat of his pants pokes
laughter ended so abruptly it might
have been severed with a knife
your mules head done that he

roared ill have you in court-

  just a minute boys bud tuttle
interrupted cant you see youre
getting nowhere now suppose you

shake-

  a glare from the two sourdoughs
silenced him poke returned to his
half of the cabin while hard-rock
rigged up a harness attached it to a
light sled and prepared to haul the
logs by hand

  bud returned to the marshals
office to find dad morton and half
of the mining camp awaiting him
what luck bud they chorused
none at all bud grumbled
each is packing a chip on his shoul-
der and no matter what a man says
it is the wrong thing

  its your big chance to figure
something out said dad morton

  ill do my best bud glumly
promised

  youd better do it quick then
dad urged the break-up will be
here in a week or so i want to see
them blazing a safe trail into the
iron mountain country before the
chechahcos show up otherwise my
office will spend all of its time try-
ing to find lost people

  bud tuttle or nobody else can
get em together a voice remarked
as bud entered the office its one
of the things well have to say is too
bad

buds reflections were broken
by a demanding voice hey
you tuttle when am i goin
to get my trial i dont want to
stay in your jail forever


street  smiths western story magazine

  bud peered into one of the largest
cells and recognized jim listman
who had been charged with running
another mans trap line

  all youve got is pete sathers
word that i stole fur from his traps
and i say i didnt my word is as
good as his a man aint guilty until
its proved so im innocent
whyre you keepin ag innocent man
locked up

  developing into something of a
lawyer eh bud drawled annoyed
because listman had interrupted
the trend of his thoughts

  i dont know anything about
that listman snarled but i know
i ought to be out of this place
sometimes i feel like tearing the
place apart

  bud thought he looked capable of
it as he stood with his massive hands
clutching the bars

  youre said to have a weakness
for fur bud ventured

  sure i have-its pretty and
brings good money listman an-
swered but im law-abidin and i
dont have to rob traps i know
where theres the finest silver fox
country in the north

  you do bud walked over to
the prisoner when you talk silver
fox you speak my language say
ill go your bail and give you a
chance to work until your trial
comes up if youll give me your word
of honor to return when youre

notified and-

  i knew thered be a string to it
listman growled

  and tell me where i can trap a
couple of prime pelts for my mother
-and do another little job for me
at the same time bud said

  sure listman hastily agreed
lets have the details

  wait bud suggested ill get
the marshal so hell know whats go-

ing on it might look queer for a
deputy to go a prisoners bail

  dad morton responded to buds
call and for several minutes the trio
talked then the marshal drew his
deputy aside

  i guess its all right if you feel
listman wont double-cross you i
wont advise either way though-
the only way a young feller learns
is by experience its up to you
now that ive had my little say
ill take a chance bud replied
turn him loose to-night ive got
enough gold dust in the bank to
cover his bail and my word that
ill deposit with the commissioner
ought to be good

  good as gold bud the marshal
answered

  bud was awakened the following
morning by an uproar under his win-
dow he looked out and was greeted
by seeley who was pacing back and
forth shouting

 bud bud theyre at it
again

  whos at it again

 hard-rock and poke youd
better come seeley advised

bud hastily dressed and ran to
the scene of hostilities the
partners were facing each
other and only sheer exhaustion
kept them apart

  whats the trouble the deputy
marshal demanded

  poke sneaked in last night and
swiped my half of the fur hard-
rock panted

  thats a lie poke snarled it
was you that took my half now
youre accusin me of takin yours
its a backfire to cover your own
crookedness thats what it is

  this has gone far enough bud
interrupted you may not pull to-
gether any longer but at least each
trail pardners



is honest and you both know it
now what happened

  all either man could tell was that
they had slept soundly after their
hard day and when they awakened
the fur was gone

  silver fox too hard-rock said
if i didnt know listman was in
jail id swear he swiped em

  bud said listman was released
last night on bail

 then he done it the two
chorused

 circumstantial evidence-

began bud

  circumstantial evidence your
grandmother hard-rock jeerd
im goin after that cuss

 you said it poke added
hard-rock if you want the legs of
the mule to go with your upper half
you can have em

  thanks well settle our private
fight after this is over with youre
cornin along aint you hard-rock
asked

  id like to see anybody stop me
poke replied

  a half hour later the partners were
on the trail bud promised to follow
as soon as he could get organized
it looked as if the chase would be
a long one

  the footprints of a big man led
straight north toward the iron
mountain country the depths
which his moccasins had sunk into
the snow indicated he was carrying
a heavy pack

  fur hard-rock said after a
brief inspection our fur most
likely and hes mushin fast
and is takin the shortest and
hardest way to iron mountain
poke added three hours later look
-headin straight for icy pass
that night they made a sapling
fence turned tabasco loose in the
hastily constructed inclosure cached
what they could not carry and

made plans to continue the chase
afoot the fur robber had evidently
sighted them noted the mule and
promptly taken a trail the heavy
animal could not follow

 at daybreak they broke camp
wind was howling through icy pass
and loose snow was blowing in the
shelter of an ice-coated boulder they
found tracks

  he went straight across blue
glacier last night hard-rock
gasped its a wonder he didnt go
through one of those snow bridges

  maybe he did poke suggested
and if that happened its good-by
fur

  do you know poke hard-rock
observed him riskin his neck that
way is a sort of a compliment to us
he knew danged well wed overhaul
him if he werent careful come
on

  they climbed to the surface of the
glacier and advanced slowly stop-
ping often to discuss the safest
course to follow from their com-
bined knowledge they worked out a
trail which carried them a mile
without danger then they
stopped ahead a crevasse yawned
it was several yards in width and
the rim on either side curved back
leaving a glassy surface sharply
pitched

hard-rock located a fifty-
pound rock which the glacier
was carrying with other
debris gouged from some ridge and
rolled it to the rim then gave a
mighty heave it bounced twice
then disappeared into the blue-black
depths of the great ice crack they
listened but there was no sound of
its striking

  man man the little irishman
cried in an awed tone shes a long
ways down there

  poke pointed at a snow bridge


street  smiths western story magazine

  our man went across last night
when it was frozen tight and safe
shes thawed some since morning
what do you think he asked

  hard-rock rubbed the fringe of
red whiskers across his jaw and
shook his head

  it looks like its a problem for
the old shipley-tupper team he
ventured

  without further words each took
a long line from his pack tied them
then with one end lashed around his
waist hard-rock crawled onto the
snow bridge slowly poke paid out
the line

  a chunk of snow dropped from the
center of the bridge and hard-rock
froze while pokes big hands
clutched the line the danger
passed and hard-rock crawled to
the other side

  its a wonder the whole works
didnt go last night under his weight
do you think youd better risk it
poke he anxiously inquired
after all its only fur and a fur-
robber were after

  with you on the other end of the
rope poke answered and a trace
of affection crept into his voice id
risk hell

  hard-rock shed his pack then
with a hand ax cut holes for his heels
in the ice he set his heels took in
the slack of the line and said all
right

  poke began crawling over the
bridge and hard-rock kept the line
tight

  take it easy he suddenly
shouted that snows ibeginnin to
drop from the arch

  movement might make matters
worse and poke froze as hard-rock
had done but he was heavier
blocks of snow dropped and the
long sourdough waited knowing any
moment the section beneath him
might fall

  that takes nerve boy hard-
rock cried then he swore as an-
other mass fell the arch across the
crevasse was dangerously thin
then suddenly the fall stopped and
a tense silertce settled over the ice
field as if even nature were awaiting
the outcome

 poke removed his pack and
pushed it ahead of him to lighten
the strain on his partner should the
bridge break then he squirmed
ahead five ten feet he moved
then suddenly he saw the snow
ahead sag

  shes going he roared as an
irregular section dropped

  he dropped amid a shifting mass
of ice and snow but the rope held
and his body was drawn against the
wall of the crevasse only a snow
cushion saved broken bones it was
all over in a matter of seconds

  how are you poke hard-rock
shouted

  im all right can you hang
onto the line

  say are you hintin i aint man
enough hard-rock gasped you
long drink of water for two cents

id- he saved his breath and

began to haul in the line hand over
hand inches at a time while poke
dug his moccasins into every niche
and helped to lighten the load
slowly he was drawn to his partner
hard-rocks hand pulled him the last
foot and for several minutes they
lay gasping on the brink of de-
struction

  lost my pack poke said finally

  ive got enough for both of us
hard-rock answered well lets
get that cuss

as the shadows fell that night
hard-rock saw the iblow of a
- - fire in the trees ibordering the
glacier were pretty tired he
growled hut-theres our man
trail pardners



  poke swung in behind his partner
they approached the camp with
caution and took observations

  its listman poke whispered
and theyre our furs

  yeah our furs hard-rock
agreed

  it wasnt my furs and your furs
but our furs they exchanged
glances nodded then hurled them-
selves on the man by the camp fire

  listman was half onto his feet
when poke hit him he went down
but was up instantly shedding the
clawing partners as a duck sheds
water his right elbow smashed
into hard-rocks stomach as the
little sourdough was renewing the
attack he went down with a grunt
but bounced to his feet again

  pokes fist nailed the giant over
the right eye he went back onto
his heels recovered his balance and
rocked poke with a punch to the
jaw poke instead of retreating
clinched listman grinned and got
pokes long neck in the crook of his
arm and began to shut off the wind

  how do you like that the giant
jeered

  hard-rock seeing his partner
clawing for air and his eyes be-
ginning to protrude hunched his
head deep between the shoulders and
charged six feet from listman he
left the ground and struck the big
fellow in the stomach with his head

  listmans knees buckled his eyes
glazed then his arms dropped
poke eased him to the ground and
grinned at his partner

  that punch with your head
always sinks em he said

  hard-rock gently rubbed the back
of his neck which seemed dislocated
from the impact

  lets tie him up he suggested

  five minutes later listman re-
gained consciousness

  were you boys caught in that
earthquake he asked what fell
on me the glacier

  nope hard-rock answered
my head you danged fur thief
youre goin back to jail brother
and youre goin to be out of cir-
culation for a long time there may
have been some doubt about youre
stealin fur out of pete sathers
traps but its a cinch youve swiped
ours weve caught you red-
handed

  id like to bet i dont serve a
day listman retorted im too
smart for you

  hard-rock and poke took turns
guarding their prisoner that night
the return trip began at daybreak
they avoided the glacier with its
snow bridges and blazed a longer
trail when they reached tabascos
corral late that night hard-rock
drew his partner aside

  do you know poke he said
the chechahco kid was right we
cant get along without each other
ive been thinkin maybe we should
open up a good trail to the iron
mountain country

 so have i and if listman
hadnt swiped our fur and brought
us together we might have split for
good poke replied now suppose
i take tabasco and the prisoner
back to big nugget ill sell our
fur and get some trail grub

  and in the meantime hard-
rock interrupted ill relay what
weve got here over the bad coun-
try

  thats my idear exactly poke
agreed

hard-rock stood guard all
that night knowing he
could rest the next day
while poke would be alone with the
prisoner the remainder of the
street  smiths western story magazine

journey poke awakened at day-
break refreshed and ready to start
the fur was loaded on tabascos
back and after an early breakfast
the trek to big nugget resumed

  poke tupper found his prisoner
meek enough except for an occa-
siona protest over the long marches
without rest

  tryin to kill me off he would
complain me hoofin it and you
ridin the mule some of the time
im trying to tire you out so you
wont start nothin you cant finish
poke explained

  they arrived at dad mortons
office after big nugget was in bed
dad morton and bud tuttle were
playing cards when poke herded
listman into the room

  heres the fur stealer poke
cried we want him to get the
limit too ill sign a paper tellin
what hes done me and hard-rock
wont be here for the trial as were
headin for the iron mountain
country

  well you didnt get far did
you bud jeered at the prisoner
you just couldnt keep your fingers
off other mens furs could you
aw shut up listman snarled
as bud locked him up

  poke tupper shook hands with
the old marshal and his deputy

  im leavin first thing in the
morning poke said so i wont see
you until next fall good luck and

be sure listman gets whats coming
to him

  i sure will bud promised
poke departed and for several
minutes there was silence then list-
man spoke

  that was a fine idea you had
tuttle he bitterly observed turn-
ing me loose to steal their fur so
theyd forget their differences while
running me to earth they liked to
have killed me shipley the old
goat butted me in the stomach with
his head and i thought sure blue
glacier had fallen on me

  maybe this will help some list-
man bud answered as he released
the other its a hundred dollars
your pay as special deputy in this
case its money well spent because
itll save this office hundreds of dol-
lars looking for stampeders who
might get lost if hard-rock and poke
werent blazing a trail

 thanks listman answered
ill put it into trail grub im goin
on that stampede myself how
about the charge pete sather
brought

  i talked with pete bud in-
formed him he said if you
didnt double-cross me and skip the
country with hard-rock and pokes
fur you werent the one who stole
from him and so i guess youre
not

  which is something i knew right
along listman growled eying the
hundred-dollar check

coming next week

the vendetta kid

by stanley hofflund
quick sixes

the dinner bell jangled
brazenly in the open
doorway of the tascosa
hotel and the main
street emptied swiftly
taking on its usual noontime hush
in the shadow between two build-
ings jim vestry stood motionless
and unseen staring at the front of
the tascosa bank across the street
this was the time either he was
a fool reading crazy meanings into
unimportant things or the few min-
utes just to come would see swift
drama played upon that peaceful
stage out there

  five men walked into vestrys
range of sight coming from some-
where to his left and angling out to-
ward the bank vestry stiffened to
sudden attention the leader was
a tall stoop-shouldered man with a

coarse unpleasant face darkly
masked by a stubbly week-old
beard vestry had seen that face
a while ago through the glass parti-
tion that closed off the office of
franklin dean president of the
tascosa bank from the banks main
lobby he saw now that the stran-
ger wore two guns in holsters from
which the bottom half had been cut
away

  half-breed holsters vestry
had never seen them used before
but he knew the trick with a hol-
ster like that a man need not draw
his weapon at all a hand dropped
to the jutting butt would tilt the
gun on the pivot of its thong sup-
port-save a precious part of a sec-
ond in time of need that was the
theory of it at least the method
had its drawbacks in actual practice


street  smiths western story magazine

 the wearers body prevented the
 pivoted gun from swinging far to
 either side for one thing cut down
 the possible arc of fire

   the five men halted briefly in the
 recessed doorway of the bank the
 shadow there veiling the movements
 from vestrys gaze unless his sus-
 picions were the mere vaporings of
 an imagiantive fool these men were
 donning masks but he could not
 be sure he saw them push the
 bank door inward and file through
 heard a short sharp yell that was
 shattered before it reached its peak
 by two quick shots

   vestry spat an oath as he lunged
 from his hiding place into the bril-
 liant sunlight that bathed the street
 j he had not expected shooting yet
 he had thought only of franklin
 dean had been sure that dean
 himself would give the bandits no
 excuse to shoot but he had forgot-
 ten deans cashier dave wilson
 would fight he realized now why
 the cashier had never entered into
 his calculations wilson always
 went to dinner just at noon leaving
 dean to watch the bank alone
 something must have delayed him
 to-day-of all days

there was a man in the door-
way of the bank vestry
saw him crouched in the cor-
ner of the deep recess saw a red
tongue of flame reach out as a bul-
let droned past vestrys ear ves-
trys answering guns blasted chalky
dust from the stone wall a foot
above the marksmans head the
crack of the reports blending with
the echoes of that first shot vestry
had drawn both guns in mid-stride
the vestry draw-that amazing
whip of agile hands that had writ-
ten the vestry name father and
son among the famous gun-fighting
men who had built the west a

man needed no trick holsters if his
hands were fast enough

  the man in the doorway ducked
whirled and darted back inside the
bank vestry had crossed the street
at a sprinting stride and his boots
thundered briefly on the plank side-
walk before the bank he dropped
his head charging at the closing
door his shoulder struck it before
the latch could fall the heavy bar-
rier crashed inward before his
weight hurling a mans body before
it to sprawl full length halfway
across the room vestry flung a
shot at the slithering shape even as
it fell could not be sure if his lead
had hit or not

  yonder in the cashiers cage
dave wilson clutched at the iron
bars of the grille before him sway-
ing slowly and sinking down there
was a scarlet smear on his white
shirt front-like a rose another
man stood just outside the cage his
back toward the door there was
a smoking gun in that mans hand
the gun that had pinned the scarlet
rose on wilsons shirt

  the man outside the cage spun
swiftly to face the door and ves-
try fired once hastily carried for-
ward by the momentum of his
charge the man yelled and ves-
try saw the smoking weapon leap
from the bandits hand and fall
spinning a bloody shower sprayed
from mangled fingers as the bandit
threw up his hand and yelled again
vestry ended his charge close in be-
side the cage whirled slashing his
left-hand gun across the bandits
head there were four others some-
where near no shots to waste

  a gun spat thunderously from be-
hind the front door and vestry
poured two slugs at the licking
flames it seemed dark in here
coming from the sunlight outside
another gun ibarked at vestrys left
quick sixes



and he leaped to the right gliding
down along the wall toward the
rear but it was treacherous wall
a wall of iron bars with four-inch
openings between

  a whisper of movement at his
back warned vestry but not in time
he flung up his arm as he turned
took the smashing impact of the
blow on arm and head as he fell
he heard the deafening roar of a
point-blank shot knew that the
very blow had saved his life he
rolled flinging his body clear of the
wall and back a door opened just
ahead-the door to deans private
office vestry had a glimpse of a
man in a trim gray suit standing
there he lurched to his knees
stabbing two swift shots at a man
inside the cage before the vault

  this time there was no sound to
warn him nothing to deflect the
blow that slashed down across his
skull he saw a mighty pin wheel
of exploding stars through the
muffling blanket of unconsciousness
he heard dimly the sound of voices
of hurrying feet he fought back
the smothering blackness matching
his will against the dead inertia of
his legs somewhere a mans hoarse
voice yelled a curt command

  come on you fools the whole
townll be on us in a minute drift

vestry struggled up a tall
man with broad stooped
shoulders slid through the
bright rectangle of the front door
and vestry saw that he bore a
weighty sack vestry yelled swung
his gun up saw it waver uncertainly
in the light he held his fire surg-
ing forward in pursuit he stag-
gered crazily as he ran toward the
street heard the sudden thunder of
departing hoofs

  his own big sorrel stood at the
rack outside and vestry clutched at

the saddle horn as the horse swung
out-found a stirrup-felt his body
jerked into the saddle as the sorrel
lunged away the dust from the
preceding riders boiled up in ves-
trys face choking him guns
barked in scattered volleys from
either side and vestry knew that
the townsmen were up in arms a
bullet sang too close for comfort
past his head and he swore me-
chanically he raked his mount
with steel-fanged heels and took a
grateful breath of cleaner air as they
left the dusty street for open prairie
sod

  he could see the men ahead of
him now grinned as he saw their
lead cut down by the sorrels reach-
ing stride they saw him too and
he saw the red tongues of flame stab
back at him as they worked their
guns

  it ended with startling sudden-
ness the big sorrel stumbled heav-
ily and vestry knew that a slug had
found its mark he kicked his feet
clear of the stirrups as the big horse
dived nose-on in a smashing fall he
landed clear striking on his head
and shoulders with force he rolled
bringing himself to a stop in a sit-
ting posture heels braced the sor-
rel struggled briefly and lay still
vestry laid his one remaining gun
across his knee and thumbed the
hammer back until it fell on empty
brass even as he fired he knew the
hopelessness of it he was half sob-
bing as he turned at last to stare at
his fallen mount cursing in a
strange tight voice the murder-
in sons

  horsemen clattered toward him
from the town in a little while and
vestry stood up long tom
travis rode in the lead his sheriffs
star agleam in the sun the riders
drew in forming a tight circle hem-
ming vestry in he stared at them


street  smiths western story magazine

  what are you stoppin for he
growled go get em why dont
you

  travis frowned youre under
arrest vestry he said distinctly
mac you and shorty take him
back t town

  vestrys jaw dropped travis
and the bulk of his posse swept for-
ward again leaving two men staring
down at vestry

  arrest vestry spoke slowly
not quick to understand i reckon
thats supposed t be funny but i
aint laughin am i travis must
be gettin childish in his old age
eh he smiled at the nearest
deputy mac was his friend mac
would explain things to him cer-
tainly

 the man cleared his throat
sorry deef he said speaking
very loud franklin dean recog-
nized you said you was in t see
him this morning askin for a loan
he refused you and he claims you
threatened him talked real wild he
says surprisin what a scrap he put
up against the six o you wasnt
it neverd expect it of a little but-
ton like him

  scrap vestrys tone was one
of bewilderment so-dean put
up a scrap did he says i helped
to rob his bank eh vestrys eyes
had tightened to beady slits he
shrugged all right boys he
said lets go to town

  the two deputies turned their
mounts waiting for vestry to lead
off one of them leaned down as
he passed shouting

  reckon well have t make you
walk deef he called you might
make a break for it if we give you a
hoss

  vestry glanced at him

  dont need to yell shorty he
said i had an operation on my ears
while i was back east i can hear

as good as any man now thats
how-come i was askin dean for a
loan this mornin them city doc-
tors sure come high

jt was long past dark that night
when jim vestry walked into
the office at the front of the tas-
cosa jail where sheriff long tom
travis awaited him franklin
dean president of the tascosa
bank was there too and vestrys
eyes rested for a moment on the
dapper little man there were other
men in the room but vestry ignored
them for the moment turning at
once to travis the sheriffs long
face seemed unusually mournful

  i sure never expected to have a
vestry for a boarder jim he said
im right sorry

  vestry grinned neednt yell
jim he said i had my ears fixed
up im some surprised to be here
too

  traviss mind handled one thing
at a time methodically not deef
any more eh that good folks
been callin you deef vestry so long
itll take some time t cure em o
yellin at you though you want t
tell your side o this business jim
i got t warn you fore you start
that anything you say can be used
against you

  vestrys gaze traveled about the
little circle of faces travis gloomy
and ill at ease two deputies here as
witnesses both curious and a little
puzzled by it all franklin dean
white-faced but defiantly trium-
phant vestry grinned at dean and
the banker frowned there was an-
other man too a stranger to vest-
try dressed in a carefully tailored
business suit vestry wondered
about him vaguely

  nothin much to tell sheriff he
said i called at the bank this
mornin to ask dean for a loan
quick sixes



bomb

reckon hes told you that he was
talkin to a man in his private of-
fice at the rear of the lobby so i
had to wait man he was talkin
to was a big jasper hadnt shaved
for a week looked like i noticed
when he finally came out that he
was wearin two guns in half-breed
holsters sort o made me wonder
it was that same hombre that led
the holdup outfit into the bank
long tom travis leaned across
his desk suddenly

  cut-down holsters you say
dark-complected man sort o
stooped he asked

  vestry nodded thats him
travis struck the desk with a
hamlike fist

  blacky weston he exclaimed
couldnt be anybody else big re-
ward out for him too wanted for
half a dozen bank robberies and a
train holdup down south o here
travis shot a curious look at dean
funny hed come in t see you sir
just before he pulled off the job
dean shrugged it would have
been funny sheriff if he had done
that but-he didnt vestry is
making his story up out of whole
cloth as he goes along

  vestry took a step forward
caught himself

 dave wilson can tell you
whether its the truth or not he
stopped remembering wilsons
dead i was forgettin that

 franklin dean chuckled de-
risively go on with your-fairy
tale vestry he said its inter-
esting

  it was a moment before vestry
spoke again this business was
more serious than he had believed
seemingly his voice was low and
carefully modulated when he spoke
at last

  i asked dean for two thousand
bucks he refused said he wasnt

loanin money on cattle any more
that made me sore cattlemen-
my dad and men like him-have
supported dean you see my ac-
count even since dad died has
averaged five times the amount i
was askin for these past four years
i called dean a double-crossin
skunk accused him of throwin in
with these crooked land-develop-
ment companies to make a few filthy
dollars by cuttin the throats of the
men who have been his friends
dean refused to talk to me said
there was a bank examiner in town
and he had t get things in shape so
the books could be examined this
afternoon i told him i figgered id
make out to get the cash i needed
in spite of him one way or another

  and you held up the bank to do
it dean shot the accusation at
him triumphantly

  vestrys lips tightened relaxed
again somethin id seen through
that glass partition of deans office
while he was talkin to that stran-
ger had made me sort of curious
he went on slowly i stuck
around right after noon i saw
this same man and four others go
moseyin into the bank and right
after that i heard somebody yell
and there was two shots

  the stranger sitting next to dean
interrupted then what was it you
saw that made you suspicious ves-
try he asked

  vestry glanced at travis the
sheriff nodded

 answer him jim he said
this is mr mathews the bank
examiner dean was tellin you
about

  vestry started to speak caught
himself after a glance at dean

  why nothin much-really he
said nothin i can-explain
exactly i just-thought it was
funny that a hard-lookin hombre


street  smiths western story magazine

like that would have business with
dean

  deans expression had been tense
at first but he sneered now

  inasmuch as the man wasnt in
my office-or in the bank so far as
i know-while vestry was there
he said it would naturally be hard
for vestry to say what it was that-
aroused his suspicions its asking
too much of his-imagination

 travis frowned what hap-
pened then jimp he asked

  i made a run for the bank as
soon as i heard those two shots a
man in the doorway took a shot at
me and ducked i bulged into the
bank after him saw wilson in the
cashiers cage just slippin down
with a red spot showin on his shirt
i unlimbered my guns at the man
standin in front of the cage
knocked the gun out of his hand
there was a lot of crazy shootin
for a minute then somebody
caught me over the head with some-
thin and i dropped i rolled back
toward deans office and was just
gettin on my feet again when the
office door opened and i saw dean
i was drawin a bead on a jasper
over by the vault and i sort of over-
looked dean i reckon it was him
that bent a gun over my head that
time

  i mustve been out for a minute
or two they were just leavin when
i come to and i follered em out
you know the rest of it im on
their tail as they leave town and
they shoot my horse out from under
me he paused for a moment
shrugged take a look at me
tom do i look like a successful
bank robber or do i look like ive
been dragged through a sack o cats
or maybe you think i marked my-
self like this

  travis frowned youre bunged
up considerable jim he admitted

but ive seen a man just as bad
hurt as you are before now after a
hoss had dropped out from under
him and dean here already told
us he batted you over the head with
a gun i reckon your hurts wont
serve you as an alibi exactly
supposin i did get all these
scratches when my horse went
down vestry spoke earnestly
now almost pleadingly dont
that prove i wasnt one of the gang
-the fact that they shot back at
me if i was one of em why would
they do that

  travis shook his head i aint
got no proof that they did jim he
said except your word maybe
your hoss was hit as you rode
through town jim there was a
lot o lead flyin about that time
he mightve run as far as he did be-
fore he dropped and theres an-
other thing youre a gun fighter
jim one o the best yet accord-
in t your yarn you practically
emptied both your guns in that
bank lobby with five targets t
shoot at and never downed a man
it aint natural deans story fits
a whole lot better he mightve
shot that many times without scor-
in a hit because he aint a gun-

fightin man but you-

  vestrys answer was apologetic
i was half blind tom he said
cornin in out of the bright sun-
light that way all i could make out
was movin shadows sort of he
paused as he caught the look of un-
belief in traviss eyes your
minds made up i see he said bit-
terly theres no use my talkin
any more

he turned walking slowly
back to the door of the cell
from which they had
brought him one of the deputies
accompanied him and as they
quick sixes



neared the door vestry caught the
mans arm

  mac tell travis i want to see
him after dean has gone its im-
portant the deputy nodded
swung the barred door shut and
walked away

  it was some time later when
travis opened the door of vestrys
cell

  you wanted t talk t me jim
whats on your mind

  this tom vestrys voice was
low but it was filled with an eager
intensity that weston jasper was
in deans office like i said dean
was lyin i didnt dare talk any
more while dean was listenin but
heres the truth weston and dean
was fixin it up between em to stage
that holdup i didnt see enough
to be sure just what it meant at the
time but i knew somethin was in
the wind so i stuck around dean
planned it himself sabe he must
be short on his books and doped out
the robbery to clear himself how
much does he claim he lost

  close t sixty thousand-

  wait jim deans goin to meet
the holdup men to-night to get his
split of the loot you let me out o
here and ride with me where i tell
you and ill prove im tellin you
the truth

  travis stood up

  son he said i was hopin i
was wrong about your bein mixed
up in this thing but this cinches it
with me accusin dean because
hes accusin you is about the weak-
est sort o tale you could figger out
jim id a expected better of you
and if you think im goin off on a
wild-goose chase with you and give
you a tailor-made chance t get
away from me youre crazy thats
all

  you think im lyin

  travis shrugged i aint blamin

you for lyin jim only you
mightve done a better job of it
he turned toward the door so
long feller i wouldnt tell that
story in court if i was you its too
durn thin

  a hurtling weight struck travis
squarely between the shoulder
blades and he went down heavily
beneath an avalanche of arms and
legs vestry had leaped straight
forward from his crouching posture
on the cot as travis reached the
door and the two straining bodies
flung the door wide open as they
fell there was a moment or two of
straining effort vestrys right fist
came free at last and whipped up to
land with a thud on traviss jaw
the sheriff relaxed instantly his
head rolling back

  vestry sat on his heels panting a
little two heavy colts lay in the
holsters at the sheriffs hips and
vestry lifted the weapons sliding
them into the empty leathers where
his own guns had been travis
opened his eyes and stared at him

  youll never get away with it
vestry he said you ought t
know that

  vestry grinned dont bet on it
tom he said i always liked you
but youre a bull-headed old coot
and i aim to handle you accordin
if you got any ideas about lettin
out a yell for help think again
next time i hit you ill wrap a gun
barrel around your ivory dome
sabe

  they slid out into the pitch dark-
ness behind the jail followed the al-
ley for a little way until a narrow
space between two buildings gave
access to the street there were
horses there and vestry chose two
forced his prisoner to mount they
rode out of town together-two
vague figures in the darkness head-
ing north


street  smiths western story magazine

it was nearing midnight when
they stopped at last in the
shadow of close-growing trees
they were on the southern flank
of bay horse mountain travis
knew there was a clearing ahead
and a darker hulk that must be a
shack thin strips of light outlined
a window there travis spoke for
the first time since they began their
ride

  thats the old bar  line shack
aint it what are we doin here

  vestrys fingers sank deep into the
sheriffs arm a thin trickle of
sound came up the mountain break-
ing finally into the beat of hoofs a
man rode out of the shade on the
opposite side of the clearing and a
yellow mouth opened in the cabin
as a door swung inward silhouetting
another man against the inner light
the newcomer spoke softly as he
dismounted he went inside

  vestry hitched his belt up a lit-
tle lifting the two strange guns to
test their weight his tongue licked
out moistening his lips

  you wait here tom he said
i wont be long

  he walked light-footed as a cat
toward the shack the moon slid
out from behind a cloud and vestry
looked up

  pretty he said

 a murmur of voices drifted
through the cracks between un-
chinked logs in the cabin wall and
vestry stooped a little peeping
through he straightened finally
and walked toward the door it
gave inward slowly noiselessly

  a man with a stubbly week-old
beard pushed a packet of crisp bills
across a table underneath a swing-
ing light franklin dean president
of the tascosa bank laid that
packet atop the neat stack of cur-
rency in front of him

  twenty-eight thousand he said

ten to me and you split the rest
of it

 vestry spoke softly from the
open door mustve miscounted
dean he said they was tellin
me in town the bank lost twice that
much

  the group around the table split
suddenly like an exploding bomb
quick sixes ripped the silence with
their raucous thunder and there
was a jangling crash as something
smashed the window into shreds
vestrys hands whipped up rocking
behind his spouting guns the
vicious crack of a rifle cut the
deeper echoes of the colts and ves-
try saw long tom traviss face
framed in the broken window oppo-
site him vestrys lips twitched
back in a wolfish grin good old
tom

  a chair hurtled straight at ves-
trys head and he ducked going
down to his knees the guns still
chopped in deadly arcs as his
thumbs rolled their hammers back
hot smoke billowed up from the
belching muzzles stinging vestrys
eyes

  a little man in a business suit
cowered against one wall whimper-
ing three bodies lay sprawled awk-
wardly across the wreckage of the
table another man lay in a twisted
heap beside the bed groaning dis-
mally a tall black-bearded man
with two guns still sheathed in cut-
down holsters stood a little to the
left rocking on his heels his knees
gave suddenly and he fell striking
shoulder first heavily it was over

 long tom travis chopped the
jagged glass from the window ledge
and came through like a lumbering
bear he glared at vestry as he
found his feet

 walkin off like that he
growled leavin me t suck my

ws-b
quick sixes



thumbs i ought t break your
neck never noticed there was a
rifle in my saddle boot did you
neither did i till after youd gone
or i mightve shot you into the mid-
dle o next week he chuckled sud-
denly the sound making strange
contrast with his gloomy face
tellin me the truth after all
wasnt you jim i thought you
was just makin it up when you
claimed you heard dean and wes-
ton make this date

  dean turned slowly from his
place against the wall

  you couldnt have heard he
said hoarsely voices dont carry
through that glass partition i
know because ive tested it and
anyway we were speaking very
low

  vestry grinned thats right
he said but just as weston stood
up to leave you was talkin to him
wait till i get rid of vestry you
said just after twelve will be best
i think ill meet you to-night at
the shack on bay horse thats
what you told him aint it

  deans eyes widened

  no use denying it now he said
but you couldnt have heard i
tell you

  vestry nodded i couldnt hear
dean he said but a man thats
been half deef as long as i was learns
to listen with his eyes sabe i saw
you talkin understand i read
your lips

  there was silence for a moment
long tom travis broke it with an
explosive oath

  thats rich he said and
dean reports a loss big enough t
cover the shortage on his books be-
sides gettin a split out of the rob-
bery that reminds me how
much was that loan you was askin
for this mornin jim two thou-
sand wasnt it

  vestry nodded

  travis grinned the rewards of-
fered for weston total double that
he said and more not t mention
the chance of there bein rewards

       return

by carlos st clair

  author of two-fisted pard etc

well im a horny toad
a centipede and a
scorpion jade hol-
loway leaning along
the sweated and dust-
streaked neck of his trail-weary ca-
yuse stared down wide-eyed at
the roughly lettered board which in
lieu of a headstone marked the
narrow mound of sun-dried clods
which had attracted his startled at-
tention

next to it a more decorous-ap-
pearing mound was headed by a

granite slab which bore the name of
abigail jane holloway and a date
of four years previous that was
jades mother and it had been with
some vague half-furtive thought of
telling her that he was home again
come back to windy basin and the
circle dot that jade had reined his
winded nag under the familiar elk-
horn portals which marked the
spruce hill burying ground

  hed told her before she died
that he would always stay in windy
basin and hang onto the circle dot
fugitives return



the place that she had come to as a
bride and held to through the long
and bitter years it had seemed an
easy thing to promise her for jade
inherited her own obsessing love of
soil but with his mother dead a
year hed started sitting in on the
faro games ab ferris ran in the
town of little pine and got hope-
lessly bogged down in debt ab had
let things run a while and then hed
threatened jade to take away his
property in foolish desperation
jade had robbed the bank at little
pine and in a shooting fracas after-
ward shot a man hed been a
fugitive from the law for three long
years yet even so hed managed
to hang on as he had said he would
when the circle dot went up for
taxes hed hired a saddle bum hed
met with on the trail to bid it in
under the name of freed-jim
freed-the name he meant to claim
it by

  jade had had to wait a long time
though before hed dared to come
back home the self-inflicted
wounds that hed made to change
once-handsome features into the
strangely puckered mask he wore
had taken time to heal and he had
let a stubby mustache grow among
the scars and it had taken time
to learn the new half-halting gait
so different from the easy swinging
stride that once had been familiar
to all this countryside not easy
either to change beyond all chance
of recognition the deeply pleasant
rumble of his voice and all the little
mannerisms and tricks of speech
that might identify a man

 but because he wanted more
than anything in all the world to
come back here to windy basin
and spend out his days on the soil
where he was raised and where his
mothers bones lay buried he had
accomplished it and he was back

at last-to find this grave confront-
ing him

 he read the words from the
wooden slab aloud slowly sibi-
lantly jade holloway died
august th  may he rest in
peace

 a sudden clammy sweat broke
out along jades brow it gave a
man a funny feeling to read his own
obituary and august th-that
was the very night hed robbed the
bank and made his get-away the
thing was spooky there must be
some one planted here-some one
whod been identified as him

  jade sat a long time slouched
across his saddle horn staring at
the wooden slab at last he mut-
tered ugh-i wonder-could
that be lonnie davis who helped
me rustle what few cows the circle
dot was runnin time i went away
i remember now that when i
bought that outfit of new duds fig-
urin my old clothes would be a give-
away if anybody spied me openin
up that safe i gave lonnie all my
old ones he must have met some
accident that sort of messed his fea-
tures up the clothes was recognized
and his carcass planted here for
mine

 jade holloway died august
th jade read again and shiv-
ered mebbe its an omen he
told the pricked ears of his tired
cay use mebbe we better back-
track out of here the way we come

 but then jade had a sudden
thought and laughed if there was
any omen in it it was luck sheer
luck to all intents and purposes
jade holloway was dead-and that
was just exactly what hed wanted
folks to think here was the proof
no one would ever look in the live
jim freed for a resemblance to a
man theyd buried

  jades mind was easier than it


street  smiths western story magazine

had been in months as he left the
burying ground and headed for the
circle dot

he spent two happy days
there wandering up and
down the old familiar trails
and would have been content never
to set his foot outside its boundaries
again had not the pangs of hunger
forced him to the town of little
pine to buy supplies

  in spite of repeated self-assurance
that all was well-that that grave
up yonder had lent the finishing
touch to his disguise-jade was
nervous as he reined his nag up the
dusty main street of the town he
thought that people stared at him
unduly and expected every moment
that some familiar face would light
with the sudden gleam of recogni-
tion he rode the towns whole
length sweat pouring underneath
his collar before he realized the
stares were for the stranger that he
seemed to be he tied his mount
at the familiar rack in front of andy
allens mercantile and went in with
his halting gait to dicker for sup-
plies

  it seemed to jade as if three
years ago were yesterday-that
same old smell of kerosene and vine-
gar and harness leather and the
three old codgers spreckles and
cave and remis squatted bfhind
the stpve and andy allen coming
up red-nosed as ever rubbing his
hands and saying

  howdy stranger anythin i
can do for you to-day

 jade said im jim freed
bought in the holloway circle dot
a couple years ago when it went up
for taxes never figured id move
out this way myself but times is
tough up north and i thought id
try my hand at ranchin

  why now freed thats fine

andy replied were mighty glad
to have you with us step up
gents he called to the loungers in
the rear and meet jim freed

  the men slouched up and shook
hands looking the stranger over
level-eyed and unabashed as was
the custom in these parts jade
couldnt help but squirm a little
though he knew that he was getting
by all right it was uncannily queer
-all these familiar faces grouped
about him and himself unrecog-
nized

  old remis said in his customary
croak welcome to windy basin
freed wishin you better luck
though than them holloways had
-them whose place you bought

  so jade asked eager to hear
what remis had to say but strug-
gling to keep a level voice and the
look of calm disinterest on his
twisted face

  yep remis said mebbe you
never heard old holloway he
died first year that they was out
here-that was twenty year ago
the woman did the work of half a
dozen men coddlin and tendin that
place of theirs like it was somethin
human and she raised the kid be-
sides she worked her heart out
died four year ago and the next
year after that young jade is shot
and killed up on the knife edge
trail his horse came in but they
didnt find the fellers body till six
months after where hed took a
header off the cliff into the canyon
bottom the wolves had had their
way with him by then but his
clothes was easy to identify

  uh-huh jade muttered to him-
self just like i thought he
forced himself to light a quirly be-
fore he said aloud

  sho now that was hard luck
reckon thats why the place went
up for taxes though so im the
fugitives return



gainer you say this fellow jade
was shot

 old re mis nodded they
found the bullet hole clean through
the coat and vest some say-
though its ab ferris mostly that
makes the claim-that it was jade
who pulled the robbery of the bank
in little pine that night that he
got a bullet wound and later ridin
up that narrow trail fell off his
horse ab couldnt prove it
though they couldnt find no loot
there was jades bones and there
was plenty circumstantial evidence
that indicated murder

swift rage rose in jades
breast ab ferris eh trying
to lay suspicion on him even
after he was dead ab who had
been responsible for all jades
trouble jade cursed ab now be-
neath his breath and yet jade
tried to curb the swift hot surge of
blood within him that turning his
scars to fiery hue might well betray
him

  no one however seemed to no-
tice and the other men were bid-
ding jim freed welcome as remis
turned away jade bought supplies
and wandered presently along the
street fate he meditated had
played another gruesome trick-
though in his favor now at last
there was no doubt but what old
lonnie davis flush with the money
jade had paid him that august
night three years ago had gotten
drunk and riding home had fallen
off his horse on the narrow trail
that bullet hole through jades old
coat and vest was but a mere coin-
cidence jade knew

  hed put it there himself one
night when he was shooting at a rat
and coat and vest were hanging on
a nail but anyway jade told him-
self murdered or not jade hollo-

way was dead and buried and he
was well content to let him rest
there undisturbed

  there was one final test however
which jade must make before hed
feel dead certain that he never
would be recognized hed noticed
as he rode through town that mel
wiggins was still sheriff as he had
been three years ago when mel and
his deputy young hal olmsjtead
had discovered jade making  his
get-away from the rifled bank it
had been a pitch-black night but
in the gun play which had followed
with olmstead down and groaning
mel with a bullet in him too had
blurted looks like youd make
your get-away you dirty thief but
one thing certain if ever i lay an
eye on you if it be in hell ill know
you and ill get you yet

  jade had thought of that a lot
tried to imagine what thing about
him mel might recognize if he came
back now if there were something
he had overlooked in those three
long years of preparation and yet
jade told himself he had to chance
it and the sooner it was over with
the better he would feel he wished
he hadnt killed olmstead but he
guessed he knew a dying look in a
mans eyes

  he sauntered up the street in the
direction of the old brick building
which a flapping sign announced as
jail and sheriffs office

  when jade went in he found mel
wiggins sitting with his heels cocked
on his desk as jade had seen him
sit a hundred times before

 mel said howdy stranger
and touched one stubby finger to his
hat complaint to make confes-
sion or just pass the time of day

  jade said heart hammering im
jim freed sheriff up at holloways
old place newcomer here just
thought id ask if i had to get a


street  smiths western story magazine

permit to pack a gun theres a
coyote up there keepin me awake
o nights

 there was no doubt but that
mel wiggins was the sharpest man
in windy basin he studied jade a
long long time in silence at last
he said about the gun-why
shore just help yourself no per-
mit needed just watch that you
dont shoot yourself no humans
thats all we ask he said then
tapping stubby fingers on his scarred
old desk tell me some about
yourself an officer of the peace
he added with a half-apologetic
shrug has got to be a little nosey
when it comes to strangers in our
midst

  why sure jade said although
he turned cold inside beneath the
sheriffs hard black gaze he told
the story he had rigged up when ly-
ing all those feverish suffering days
and nights alone in his mountain
hide-out while the cruel self-inflicted
wounds that were to make another
man of him-a man who could come
back to windy basin-were healing

  when he had finished mel wig-
gins said burn and indicated
with a gesture jades scarred face

  jade shook his head  nope
bear-she clawed me most to death
up in the never summer two year
ago

  the sheriff nodded i seen an-
other man that happened to
changed his looks complete take
younow you might have been a
likely-lookin fellow before the ac-
cident

jades heart was a slug of lead
mel wiggins knew had recog-
nized him there was some-
thing after all that jade in those
careful painstaking months had
overlooked he felt the overwhelm-

ing bitterness of defeat and then
mel wiggins said

  well good luck to you freed
drop in again

  jades eyes went wide he stood
there for a moment quite incapable
of action he had been wrong
mel hadnt recognized him after all
hed passed the acid test and he
was safe he could stay here now
in windy basin as long as he lived
hed work too work his head off
make the old circle dot the finest
place in all that country the way
his mother had always dreamed
sort of making up to her for the
way hed slipped and that money
he had stolen from the bank he
would pay back anonymously as
soon as he could

  the sheriff had forgotten him al-
ready jade turned to go then
halted as he heard the sheriff call
to some one evidently his deputy
hey kid drift on down to
mikes and get ab ferriss supper
if he had known he would be
shot for asking jade could not have
held the question back that he
blurted now ferris-ab ferris
here in stony lonesome

  the sheriff turned that hard
black gaze of his around

 oh you here yet you know
this fella ferris eh

  jade said why yes-that is
some jasper that i met up north
told me to look him up figured
that he might help me round up a
little stock

  mel shook his head sorry i
guess youll have to get along with-
out him abs been in state corral
for better than two year just
fetched him down last week here
for another trial-the second time
that hes appealed his case fool
way to spend his money there
aint no livin doubt but it was ab
who shot jade holloway and
fugitives return



pushed him off the knife edge
trail thered been bad blood be-
tween the two of em for months
threats had passed both ways and
ab was up on the knife edge trail
that night and there was a bullet
missing from his gun

  not but what this jade the
sheriff added got his deserts for
id bet my last red cent that it was
him who helped at least to rob the
bank that night still all in all a
lifes a life abs got to pay and
all these trials he keeps insistin on
wont help him any hell swing
i reckon after this jury sits the
only thing could save him now
would be jade holloway come back
from hell and say ab never done it
and even if jade could and if ab
hadnt im bettin that jade
wouldnt do it as i was sayin
there was plenty hate between-them
two

  then mel broke off to look at
jade and say why freed-why
man whats up youre white as
paper are you sick

  jade shook his head fighting for
control no not a bit of it just
struck me queer thats all-me be-
in sent out here to him and him
locked up mebbe im supersti-
tious jade held his breath had
he betrayed himself

  it seemed he hadnt the sheriff
said lupe smith might help you
with your cattle see him at the
palmer house tell him i sent you
well guess ill run along now to my
supper be seein you again

 jade gained the street his
thoughts a whirl ab ferris here in
jail because hed killed a man who
wasnt dead at all and ab might
swing for just a moment the
thought struck horror to jades
soul and then he saw poetic justice
in it after all ab was a crook he

should have been in stony lonesome
long ago ab was responsible too
for what jade had done responsible
for all the suffering of these last
three years or so at least jade
told himself he even laughed a
dry and mirthless chuckle to think
that he was home here sound and
safe to spend his whole remaining
years while ab who for so long had
held the upper hand was going to
swing

it had been a full exciting day
and jade was weary as he
reined his mount into the last
short stretch of trail which led him
home and yet for all his joy at
being back again the fine elation
that he felt at having passed the
acid test for which he had prepared
so long knowing that he was safe
in windy basin there was still a
little clutch of loneliness at jades
heart it was not compunction he
made sure of that for in his heart
jade felt that of the two of them
ab ferris was the man to die but
somehow suddenly jade longed to
hear his mothers voice to feel the
soft touch of her hand

 the notion came that another
womans voice and touch might
serve instead and interwoven with
the thought was the recollection of
a girl ellen her name was daugh-
ter of seams the old squatter who
had taken up a patch of land not
far from the circle dot the trail
that led to seamss mean shack lay
near at hand-perhaps the very
thing which had fostered jades
whole thought of loneliness at any
rate on sudden resolution jade
swung his nag into the narrow track

 dark had already come when he
rounded the shoulder of a ridge and
looking down on the small green
valley where seams had filed his
claim saw the distant steady gleam


street  smiths western story magazine

of lamplight through a windowpane
seams jade told himself was old
and sick at best he couldnt have
much longer now to live the girl
would be alone-and jade while
these scars of his made him no
pretty sight to offer any woman
could make her a good home if she
could be persuaded no harm at
least to just drop in neighborly
like and set the ball to rolling

  he struck a casual heel into his
ponys flank and started down the
slope-started then pulled up
short that sound hed heard dis-
tant but faint was unmistakably a
womans scream instant as a guns
report follows the fingers pressure
on the trigger jades mount was
leaping down the trail little rills
and rivulets of rock and dirt racing
its flashing hoofs while jade leaned
forward on the creatures neck
urged yet more speed

  again the womans terror-stricken
cry shredded the dark-and then
again at first though his head-
long haste and the grim peril of the
going left little time for speculation
jade had the notion that old seams
had had some sort of stroke and
the girl alone with him had cried
for help but there was something
much more poignant in those cries
he realized as he drew nearer-
something that made him urge every
last ounce of speed from the flying
mount beneath him

  as jade pounded up before the
lighted cabin and flung in running
dismount from his saddle another
horse called shrilly from the dark-
ness of the dooryard yet jade was
unprepared as he flung the shack
door open for the sight of a mans
form black and burly against the
lamplight while clasped tight in his
arms a girls tense figure struggled
as she pulled back from the kiss the

burly ruffian would force upon her
she screamed again a wild a pan-
icked note of sheerest terror

  jade was through the door in one
long leap

  all right miss ellen maam he
called i got him this skunk
wont trouble you no more

  the girls eyes black with fear
flashed toward him as suddenly re-
leased from her assailants hold she
staggered backward the man
himself black-visaged snar ling-
mouthed flung right about jade
heard the hiss of a gun on holster
leather and ducked just in the nick
of time to miss the bullet that bored
the air a scant half inch above his
shoulder and then jade crouch-
ing was across the room in two
great strides and grappling with the
fellow before his finger could
squeeze the trigger a second time

  the man snarled like some half-
mad beast and brought down his
gun the impact of it on jades
head was stunning and yet he man-
aged to complete the hard pile-driv-
ing thrust of his own right fist which
took the fellow square beneath the
chin the two went down together
rolling as one man fighting for
breath

the burly scoundrel with
whom jade grappled was the
first to get his wind snarl-
ing spitting like a coyote in a trap
he forced the gun up again to a
place where he could bring it into
action on jades head jade senses
still reeling tried to twist it from
the fellows grip and failed he
grasped the hairy wrist however
and held it while the two of them
rolled back and forth first one on
top and then the other crashing
against the wall upturning chairs
and tables setting the stove lids
fugitives return



rattling as their hurtling bodies
flung about the floor

  jades grip still held but he was
weakening fast this brute with
whom he grappled outmatched him
in both size and strength and a red-
streaked darkness was whirling in
jades brain from that first terrific
blow the man had struck it would
be minutes only jade realized till
he was overpowered there was one
chance however that he might
take if he released his hold upon
the gun and could take the punish-
ment from its flailing barrel for long
enough to grasp the fellows hairy
throat and squeeze the fight out of
his gullet he still might win

  jade did not stop to weigh the
pros and cons he suddenly released
his grip upon the fellows wrist and
his own brown fingers flashed for
the fellows throat taken unaware
the burly creature choked and
spluttered wrenched and writhed
he could not free himself but
now he raised the gun it rose and
fell and rose and fell with each
succeeding blow jade thought his
very brains must scatter out upon
the floor but still by sheer grim will
he clung as a fine breed of hunting
dog will keep its fangs deep-buried
in its adversarys throat long after
the dog itself is done

  quite subconsciously jade knew
when the man whose throat his fin-
gers pressed was finished he didnt
really see the big hulk jerk spas-
modically and fall back limp or hear
the gun arrested in mid-swing fall
clattering to the floor

  he knew though presently that
the girl was bending over him strok-
ing his brow with cool soft fingers
he told her thickly

  get that gun before the feller
comes to life and-

  she smiled at him i have

though theres not much chance that
hell come to for hours i thought
for a moment he was dead he isnt
though but most completely out
then jade smiled back at her
thats fine he whispered huskily
im glad i happened by here when

i	did

  the girls smile vanished and left
her blue eyes dark

 thank you she told him
simply thank you a million times
and then she sighed and looked sad-
der so jade thought than any
woman he had ever seen-even than
his mother when she would speak
sometimes about his dad

  im afraid the girl went on
that it wont help a lot alf-
thats this beast you just knocked
out-isnt so easy whipped and
theres sam hugis too theyre
both insisting that i marry them-
when they know-know all the time
-i cant

  a hot tear splashed on jades
scarred face a sudden wave of ten-
derness welled in him

  ellen he said forgetting for
just a moment that he was jim
freed forgetting he was a stranger
theyll never bother you again now
that im back

  bent on the inner terror of her
own thoughts the girl paid small
attention to jades words

  jade asked her gently your
pappy dead

  her eyes went wide with some
faint flicker of surprise then dulled
to lifelessness again

  two years she told him

  jade sat up pushing away the
girls restraining hands he spoke
his thoughts aloud seems funny
-though i reckon things have
changed these last three years-
but i never knew a lone girl to be
bothered hereabouts well theres


street  smiths western story magazine

one good way i reckon to put a
stop to that a married woman
is-

  the girl said quickly thats
just the trouble-its-its ab you
see both a if and sam were courting
me before i married ab they say
im good as widowed now already
that ab will lose his trial and swing
they-they forced themselves in on
me when i try to keep them out

  jade got up groggily to his feet
something inside his chest had
seemed to shrink and leave him
strangely empty

  you mean he asked that you
aint ellen seams no more but ab
-ab ferriss wife

  the girls eyes flashed her head
raised proudly

  im not ashamed she cried i
love him love him dearly even if
he killed a man the way they claim
if-if ab was here id not need any
stranger to defend me and then
the proud head fell the hot blue
eyes dissolved in tears

 jade stood and looked at her
what seemed a long long time-
stood motionless his two hands
hanging limply by his side and
yet he was not seeing her so much
as looking back along three lonely
bitter years seeing a young man
scared and heartsick crouched in a
mountain hide-out longing with
every fiber in him to get back home
seeing that same young fellow toss-
ing and feverish on his bed of
boughs during the long long
months when the infected wounds
across his face refused to heal see-
ing him well at last practicing with
infinite patience to change his
stride his voice the very motions
of his hands seeing him riding home
at last joy in his heart

  ab ferris was a cur and scoun-
drel no doubt of that whether

hed killed a man or not ab de-
served to hang but this girl had
loved him married him and be-
cause she was a jailbirds wife and
soon to be his widow she was being
persecuted and he had said to her
a little while ago theyll never
bother you again now that im
back

  again jades blue eyes stared-
looking ahead this time into the
long years that stretched out end-
lessly behind steel bars just two
days now hed been at home on his
own beloved soil two days and
he had promised her who lay up
yonder in the spruce hill burying
ground that he would stay here all
his life yet after all it was the
thought of abigail holloway de-
cided him

  maam jade said just help
me lift this carrion crow and pack
him outside there where i can tie
him on his horse ill take him back
to town and turn him loose i dont
believe if what you say of ab is
true and hell look out for you that
this skunk here or any otherll ever
bother you again

  the girl said dully why yes
why yes of course and thank you
-thank you just the same for what
you did to-night

  there was such dull surrender so
little hope in her quiet voice jade
almost told her what he meant to
do instead he smiled a little

  come on he said buck up
have faith thats what my mother
used to say

  and jade repeated it a little
later to himself this time when
with the still unconscious alf across
the horse he led jade reined his own
nag up and paused a moment where
two trails met one leading to the
circle dot the other to the town
of little pine
fugitives return



some two weeks later when
the circuit court was held in
little pine a curious situation
faced the judge for he must try for
robbery the very man whose mur-
derer he had come to judge-a legal
tangle which made that worthy jur-
ist knit his brow but finally with
the problem solved ab ferris free
and in the weeping ellens arms
jade holloway stood up to hear his
sentence

  the judge lips pursed and fingers
tented said in sonorous tones

  jade holloway since its your
purpose to repay the stolen moneys

to the bank of little pine and since
the deputy you wounded in the gun
fight did not die and since-well
since dog-gone it jade you have
proved yourself a man in every true
sense of the word-this court sus-
pends pronouncement of a sentence
at this time and puts you on proba-
tion

  what emotions played behind the
mask of jades scarred features
none could tell he didnt speak
for quite a while but when he did
jade simply said

  thank you judge if youll ex-
cuse me then ill be ridin home

 author of the calgary kid etc

dusty and weary with
eight hours of steady
riding weary with four
years of patient waiting
the lean young stranger
rode slowly out of the blackening
prairie into the barren trail town
along the single narrow thorough-
fare he rode past bleak false-fronted
structures through the dim yellow
blooms of street lamps and came
finally to a drifting halt before the
settled bulk of the town livery
stable

  a gaunt man with a hatchet face
holding a smoky lantern shoulder-
high shuffled from murky depths
and squinted up at the impassive
mask of the stranger

  howdy he said leaving
your horse

  howdy said the stranger
swinging stiffly to ground leav-
ing my horse grain him an rub
him i might be riding again to-
night

  come far wondered the lank
proprietor

  all the way from texas

  going far

  no the stranger said this is
the end

  the gaunt man stared thought
you said you might be leaving yet
to-night

  might said the stranger and
still-this is the end

  maybe you got business here
im here-the other smiled-
to meet a man

  friend eh

  no said the stranger not a
friend

  oh the lank man looked
flustered no offense partner i
didnt go to pry

  thats all right said the stran-
ger his body revolved sharply
swinging forward and he moved on
down the wooden sidewalk

alking with his head
reared slightly he kept his
sinewy arms motionless at
his sides his boots thumped de-
liberately with the funeral beat of
a muffled drum and as he passed
through alternate pools of light he
seemed to appear and vanish like a
stalking presence not yet fully
materialized
a game of draw



  light broke dismally from the
dusty windows of the longhorn
saloon as dismally perished before
the smothering pounce of malignant
dark pausing at the bat-wing
doors facing them squarely the
stranger broke them wide with a
weaving twist of his shoulders as
he stepped inside curving to the
left he slapped his shoulders against
the wall and for a moment waited
tempering his half-lidded eyes to
that smoky yellow gloom

  a roulette wheel clicked with
ironic cheer oil lamps sputtered and
hissed like snakes against the cav-
ernous ceiling the motley crowd-
weathered trail drivers gamblers in
beaver hats buffalo hunters in
fringed buckskin soldiers with
sabers several long-haired scouts-
swarmed through the glimmering
murk drank at the bar played
coldly at cards or sat with their
chairs tipped back half asleep
against the shadow-thick walls

  the strangers gaze swept the
room he poised there now sud-
denly defined in a splash of saffron
light his hips flat and his chest
arched tall and lean that battered
sombrero crouched on the back of
his head and his sandy hair tangling
around his ears like tufts of ripened
hay finally his glance found the
massive bulk of roaring bill
hyde and his eyes blazed and then
went cold

  roaring bill hyde sat at a table in
the center of the room his bulging
body a mammoth mound of flesh
playing draw poker with five buck-
skin-clad trappers sizable men by
themselves these trappers but in
the awesome shadow of roaring bill
they seemed dwarfed to insignifi-
cance for that black-bearded man
was a giant-he had enormous
hands the shoulders of an ox and

the low ring shaggy head of a great
boar

  the stranger smiled it was a
slow contented smile he crossed
now to the bar downing a drink
and then casually rolling a cigarette
he lighted the cigarette then
swinging around his elbows hooked
on the bar he loafed in lazy con-
templation of the sullen play at
roaring bills table

  it was half an hour later that one
of roaring bills companions pushed
back his chair and left the game
the stranger stepped quickly for-
ward pausing behind that empty
chair he looked at roaring bill
can i sit in he asked
roaring bill glanced up from be-
neath shaggy brows huh dont
believe i know you

  no said the stranger you
dont know me can i sit in
roaring bill narrowed his eyes
slightly then he shrugged and
nodded if you want

  i want said the stranger and
sat down

  for another half hour the play
indifferently continued the stran-
ger lost a little won a little but
finally there came a hand with every
one but the stranger and roaring
bill laying down their cards now
the lean youth looked at his hand
with a sudden interest then jerk-
ing a roll of bills from his pocket he
counted out five hundred dollars

  covering that he asked roar-
ing bill

  the huge man pursed his thick
lips scowled at his hand finally
nodded

  covered he agreed counting
the money five hundred

  the stranger picked up the deck
and looked at roaring bill

 how many

  two said roaring bill


stiget  smiths western story magazine

leaning forward the tall
youth flipped two cards at
roaring bill and swayed
back his hands dropped quickly
below the edge of the table fumbled
came up and he gave himself four
cards roaring bill and the four
trappers stared at the stranger
blankly so clumsy had been that
dipping of hands below the table
that it hardly seemed possible that
he could have deliberately changed
decks roaring bill half opened
his mouth to speak looked at his
own cards and then said nothing

  the stranger glanced at his hand
smiled and tossed another five hun-
dred on the table

  still in he asked

  with an impassive nod roaring
bill fingered out the additional
money and said im calling

  the stranger spread four aces
and a king face-up on the table

  roaring bill stared at the re-
vealed cards at his own hand and
then his face turned brick-red
slowly he spread his own hand-a
pair of jacks and three aces

  seven aces said roaring bill
thats a hell of a lot for one deck
instantly the tall youths chair
crashed over backward and his lean
body whipped erect all over the
saloon heads reared staring voices
cursed and the crowd broke in a
dozen directions out of line flatten-
ing their bodies against the parallel
walls the stranger leaned for-
ward his narrowed gaze striking
roaring bills flushed face

  an what do you mean by that
that youre a skunk thundered
roaring bill lunging to his feet
that youre a liar an a cheat
that youre a low-down double-
dealing polecat

  a quick satisfied smile brushed
the young strangers lips his voice
was ominously quiet

  thats a lot to call a man roar-
ing bill figure you can back it
with your gun

  roaring bill stood motionless his
heavy-jowled face flushed staring at
the smiling youth but gradually
then strangely an inscrutable calm
washed across his massive features
slowly he held out his right hand

  shake stranger he asked i
talked out of turn shake and
well call it quits

  the stranger nodded still smil-
ing and held out his right hand
seeming to brace himself as though
expecting a shock roaring bills
great hand closed over that of the
stranger the muscles of roaring
bills jaw ridged out with effort as
he clamped that massive paw around
the slender hand of the youth
crushing breaking the strangers
face went dead-white with pain
roaring bill gave a guttural laugh
released the hand and stepped
swiftly backward the hand of the
other dropped limply at his side
bloody the bones broken

  pilgrim snapped roaring bill
ive changed my mind youre
still a liar an a cheat now go for
your gun

  i cant go for my gun said the
stranger youve broken my hand
go for your gun thundered
roaring bill

  the youths face was white but
still his lips were faintly smiling

  my name he said is johnny
dartin

  roaring bills eyes leaped with a
sudden start he leaned forward
staring licking his lips

  why you fool he blurted
youll never know it said the
stranger but youve killed your-
self

  a sudden panic swept the massive
face of roaring bill his booming
voice came raggedly dang you
a game of draw



go for that gun and even as he
spoke his own right hand leaped to
hip grabbed his weapon brought it
violently forward

 at the same instant the young
a stranger curved slightly for-
 ward over the table and his
left hand streaked upward across
his chest to his right armpit his
left hand whipped that gun from
shoulder holster and the gun burst
with a crashing flame that shook the
tense saloon the red flame leaped
and the echo broke and roaring
bill his gun only half drawn spun
around sagged in the middle and
then with a heavy sigh crumpled
against the floor

  the stranger turned slowly and
faced the gaping crowd

 gentlemen he said you all
saw it a game of draw he went
for his gun an i killed him in self-
defense

 the crowd pushed away from the
walls shuffling forward and a
bearded cowman stepped out star-
ing fascinated at jimmy dartins
broken hand

 son he marvelled his gaze

flicking up that shoulder draw
was lightning

  when a man practices steady for
four years said johnny dartin
he gets to be tolerably fast on a
left-hand shoulder draw

  the rancher cursed softly so
you did it on purpose jus stood
there an let him break your hand
to make a hombre like him
draw johnny said you got to
give him the advantage

  an cold-deck him first jus to
make him call you the ranchers
eyes narrowed suddenly son he
recalled once i heard that roaring
bill tried almost that same play
down in texas only that time he
did the cold-decking himself
switched decks on a man an when
he got called offered to shake hands
an call it quits then he broke the
fellows hand an shot him down
johnny dartin smiled thinly
friend he agreed ive heard that
same story

  huh grunted the rancher 
yeah maybe you even knew the
man he killed

  yes johnny said i knew
him he was my father

trickery

a shiver went through
bloom he did have a
yellow streak jerry saw
bloom had made his de-
mand wildly now he
was suddenly still though not calm
even the heat was dying out of his
eyes as he looked into jerrys

  well parks drawled youre
gettin what you asked for whynt
you start

gimme my horse bloom said

  hop up said parks

  bloom mounted jerry mounted
parks pushed up to them

clared in a tense voice its jus

bloom asked uneasily

  course you can hes clumsy
with a gun hes a fool to go up
against you anybody with half an
eye can see that youre fast an
sure

  youre lyin bloom said
  ws-b

about him i mean you know
hes fast an sure

  the mans uneasiness grew what
he had demanded while rage was
running through him he now seemed
doubtful about but he seemed to
realize that he could not back down

  well he snarled arrange it

when i get him dont i

  a while ago my mind was made
up that not a man o you would

  one man said huh huh in
derision of the possibility of blooms
killing jerry the others joined
with murmurs equally derisive

jerrys as good as dead now he
returned to bloom we threell

jerryll face each other when i

most of this jerry knew was in-
tended to break bloom down in a
way it was unfair but it grew out of
the contempt in which these hard
men held such as bloom

lets start jerry said youll

think youre good with a gun i see

answer for that you can under-
stand that i guess

 scared aint you bloom
sneered in an effort to play on jerry
as those men had played on him

  jerry heard a rising note of con-
fidence and resolution in blooms
tone he was glad it was there he
and bloom were on equal terms
now he asked no more if he
could not make this thief and mur-
derer pay for the killing of shorty
flynn he would be satisfied to drift
out into the beyond to be blasted
out for that matter the hand
which would presently drag his gun
was steady and dry

  i aint scared bloom he said
quietly

  well gimme a gun

  not one of my guns well pick
up yours out on the flat

jerry started his horse bloom
followed him and parks fol-
lowed bloom when they came
to the spot at which jerry had
dropped blooms gun he told bloom
to dismount pick it up and put it
into his holster bloom dismounted
and slowly stooped he picked up
the gun his back to jerry he stood
with the gun in his hands then
jerry saw his elbows move

  i got a gun on you bloom
jerry said dont try anything
bloom scowled over his shoulder
i gotta make sure there aint no
sand in it aint i he asked

  though he spoke low jerry heard
a fine tremor in his voice and he saw
that he was sweating he had no
fat that sweat had been wrung
out of fairly dry tissues wrung out
by fear jerry believed

  bloom jerry said im sorry
for you im sorry i gotta do this
to you but its the way of the land
you know

  bloom merely cursed him vio-

  lently jerry was no longer unsure
of the outcome his heart was a
little heavy as bloom holstered the
gun and remounted then he re-
membered folding shorty flynns
hands on shortys breast and he
grew grim it was a necessary job
a job to be got over as quickly as
possible

  they rode for a little way farther
jerry was watching bloom closely
he saw that bloom was bent in his
saddle his feet pushed hard into his
stirrups jerry felt something
strange in the man a kind of ex-
pectancy he dropped his hand to
the butt of one of his guns

  a moment later parks called a
halt the old mans voice jerry
heard was somewhat uncertain
then it dawned upon jerry that this
was a pretty difficult job for parks
there was always a chance that
either man would die in an en-
counter like this if parks had to
inform jerrys father that jerry had
been killed right at the outset itd
be pretty tough

  while jerry let these thoughts flit
through his brain without permit-
ting them to disturb him he had
continued to keep his eyes on bloom
he saw bloom suddenly drop his
hand to his gun butt the gun was
drawn as swiftly as jerry had ever
seen a gun drawn in the same in-
stant bloom came about in his
saddle expecting jerry supposed to
find jerry off his guard at blooms
turning movement jerry cried out

  bloom no i got you covered
bloom-

  the explosion of blooms gun was
his answer his own gun was
leveled at bloom bloom did not
immediately fire again jerry could
see his twisted features shining from
sweat could see his hot wild eyes
and he could see the muzzle of
the barking dog



blooms gun with wisps of smoke
drifting away from it

  fire old parks shouted

  that first bullet of blooms had
sped past jerry because bloom had
fired without aiming merely dis-
charging the gun as soon as his eyes
fell on jerrys body

  jerry did not want to fire he
wanted bloom to be facing him
when he did that but he had to
fire bloom had made a mistake
but he was going to fire again as
parks shouted he leaned five inches
he was going to press his trigger
jerry pressed his own

  the men back yonder must have
seen that bloom had fired ahead of
time half a dozen of them broke
away from the others and sent
their spurred horses toward the trio
they whirled in on them then held
their horses still bloom had
straightened up with the last ounce
of his strength he was swaying in
his saddle then he fell along the
horse and dropped to the ground
his feet coming free one of the
punchers took up the horse

  jerry dismounted and knelt be-
side bloom there was nothing to
do for bloom except to bury him

  let him lie parks said let
him be buzzards meat he tried to
murder you yella pup

  i cant do that jerry protested
i killed him i gotta bury him
he turned to the punchers hand
him up to me

  but they were implacable men
not one moved out of his saddle
they wouldnt touch bloom let
him lie let him be buzzards meat
thats how bloom would have done
if he had killed jerry

  so lifting blooms body jerry
dragged himself to his saddle and
laid the body in front of him he
slowly followed the other men back
to the grouped riders

  get their guns parks ordered

  punchers went among the pris-
oners and took their guns with
groans those men lowered their
aching arms and rubbed them

  ahead of us parks ordered

  whatcha goin to do with us
a man asked his voice timid

parks gave him a look of sur-
prise and did not reply with
drooping heads the prisoners
placed themselves in front of all the
others and the ride to the ranch
began when about midnight they
rode in they did so as quietly as
possible so that they should not
rouse elizabeth and mrs tyson if
they had fallen asleep they had
not fallen asleep they at once
came out to the riders

  elizabeths seeking eyes at once
found jerry she had been walking
toward the men but when she saw
the burden which jerrys horse bore
she stopped jerry looked at her
with regret in his eyes he didnt
know which she would be-the girl
who had spent her early years on
this ranch or the girl who had lived
away from it for several years

  elizabeth came on and stood be-
side his horse she looked at bloom

  you killed him she asked

  in a fair fight jerry answered
giving bloom credit that was not
his due

  it was not in him to explain that
bloom had killed shorty flynn
elizabeth would have to judge by
his simple statement she judged
at once she put up a hand and
laid it briefly on one of jerrys

  im glad it was he not you
she said

  he killed shorty flynn jerry
said then

  i see she nodded and stepped
back came up again youve


street  smiths western story magazine

brought him here so that you might
give him burial jerry

  yes

  parks elizabeth called will
you have a horse brought up for
me

  parks had a horse brought up
elizabeth mounted

  a spade parks she said

 a puncher brought a spade
jerry took it he and elizabeth
started their horses after a mo-
ment of hesitation several punchers
moved to follow them elizabeth
turned in her saddi

  no boys she said this is
something special between jerry
hawley and me-and shorty
flynn

  the punchers remained where
they were elizabeth and jerry rode
on when they were well out on
the flat they dismounted and jerry
laid blooms body on the ground
he dug a four-foot grave in the
yielding sand put blooms body into
it and covered it up then he stood
erect and looked at elizabeth

  once more elizabeths eyes were
on the stars if she was sending
something up to them jerry knew
it was again something for shorty
flynn and not for bloom her eyes
were moist as she dropped them to
jerrys

  shorty flynn was so very young
jerry she whispered

  jerrys own throat was a little
thick it was a borrowed emotion
damn it he couldnt stand it to see
tears in elizabeths eyes

  that he growled is the devil
of it he was a gay kind of a fella

  always joyous said elizabeth

  yeah full o joy up to the top
of his head friendly to everybody
well we got this job done

  remounting they rode back to
the house they came upon a ring
of men who inclosed all those

prisoners and parks as jerry and
elizabeth stopped parks spoke

  well whatcha say

  guilty o cow stealin guilty
as hell

  cernly o course you betcha

  theyve tried those men said
elizabeth to jerry

  an found them guilty jerry
said indifferently

  well-- elizabeth hesitated

  parks had been running his eyes
around the big circle they came
so rest on jerry and elizabeth

  ho jerry i wanta talk to you
parks said come inta the house

jerry and elizabeth dis-
mounted and went into the
house parks followed them
tyson and his wife came in and
went on to the other room

  elizabeth you better get some
rest parks said you aint doin
yourself no good stayin up all
night

  are you going to hang all those
men parks elizabeth quietly
asked

  now now parks cried dont

elizabeth asked again

  i am parks stoutly answered

example of somebody i relize that
itll bring the rest of all this outfit

  turn them over to the sheriff
the barking dog



parks exploded far as i know
we aint got no sheriff in town
theys a clerk or a bartender or some
hombre that wears a star but i
dont know him an dont wanta
know him elizabeth the law is
right here on this ranch im glad
we aint got no other law yet i
spose the law will come this ol
big country is bein cut up now
wish shed stayed like she was
well till the real law gets here
were the law cow- stealin is pun-
ishable by death

  i didnt ask you whether you
could turn them over to the sheriff
elizabeth said rather tartly i
stated that you could not ive seen
that sheriff

  youre talkin like your father
now girl old parks growled

  elizabeth rose and walked to the
door of the other room there she
turned and regarded jerry

  you she asked

  i gotta

  and tyson

  oh well have to keep tyson
outta it parks jerry said ac-
count his wife a man that has a
wife like her cant be in on a thing
like that

  yeah parks agreed well get
away from him somehow

  elizabeth gave jerry a long slow
look and went into the other room

  see how she looked at you
jerry parks asked

  lissen parks jerry said ear-
nestly if you dont stop talkin
about that matter you an mell
tangle i mean it

  i gotta get the girl married off
to a puncher or a cowman parks
said as earnestly its been sevrul
years sence i had her where i could
get at her i dont mean to let her
get away he laughed lightly
course its ridiclous for me to be
playin the part o that little nakid

guy that wears a harp or wings or
whatever stead of a gun but i gotta
do the best i can

  i guess elizabeth will pick her
own husband jerry said somewhat
sulkily my gosh you couldnt
make her marry the man you
picked

  i wouldnt try to make her do
nothin parks snorted you can
lead a horse to water but you cant
make him drink but you stand a
damn sight better chance o gettin
him to drink if you do lead him to
water stead o hazin him up to it
i think youre full o uncooked
dough jerry declared

  way i feel ezacly parks de-
clared but i think a lot o eliza-
beth

  you better not go singin my
praises to her

  i had it in my mind parks
confessed but the way shes been
lookin at you has caused me to hold
my tongue im sadisfied with the
situation just as it is aw keep
your seat jerry i wanta talk
business with you

  i dont think its in you to talk
business jerry flared

  whatcha think of the layout
now parks asked serenely
whatcha think o this talk of
black redman or whatever his
name is think virlee is in it

  i cernly think virlee is in it i
think blackman does the cow work
for him i think blackman was re-
sponsible for the killin of treece
you see a red-headed man that
time

  i wasnt so lucky i dont think
this red blackman appears except
as he rides about the country alone
i dont think he mixes in anything
any more than virlee does

  yeah that sounds good well
we got two diffrunt kinds of men to
deal with i ony get a kind of a


street  smithes western story magazine

sickish feelin when i think of that
big hellion virlee i guess hes more
dangerous than i think he is but 
cant help how i feel about him
this here red blackman is probly
a hellbender ive gone up agin
his kind afore the man that faces
him final will hafta be fast an sure
the old man stared at jerry if
its you jerry youll hafta deliver
as you never delivered afore
parks said jerry seriously
when the show-down comes leave
him to me it may be that he
killed mr king himself if he

did- jerry too stopped and

stared his eyes hard and bright
parks he went on if he killed
mr king or had him killed what
could stop me from killing him
nothing said old parks simply
the two men continued to stare
at each other as if some mystic thing
were in the room at last parks
nodded

  yeah youd kill him jerry he
said youd blast his heart right
out easy parks took a deep
breath well he went on im
goin to write a letter to virlee im
goin to tell him we hung fifteen of
his men im goin to drag him out
in the open

  all right jerry agreed

  jerry sat staring at the table
parks gave him a sly look then
patted his pants pockets

  where did i leave my pipe he
asked i gotta smoke whilst im
writin a letter he rose be
back in a minute jerry

  jerry only nodded parks went
outside he was back in a short
time and set about writing his letter
when he had finished he read the
letter to jerry

  its all right jerry said it
lets him know that were sure hes
guilty of everything thats happened
and that red blackman is his right-

hand man you call him a good
many names parks

  i dont call him the names he
should be called parks asserted
because them names aint well
ill take this letter to a boy outside
hes goin to get it to virlee to-
morrow somehow i dunno jus how
he volunteered i ast him to
volunteer

  jerry smiled as parks again went
outside the old man had his own
way of doing things jerry thought
and indeed parks was to prove
that he had his own way of doing
things

  he came in presently and sat
down and refilled and lighted his
pipe jerry smoked a cigarette
time slipped away while the two
men sat in silence

  must be one oclock jerry said

  parks produced a big silver watch

  two he said

  so late what time you goin
to start that bee parks

  lemme rest a bit jerry i dont
stand these rackets like i usta
time was i could set my saddle
seventy-two hours at a stretch an
never turn a hair cant do it no
more reason probly is i aint got
many hairs left to turn ho hum

  a fit of abstraction came to jerry
he idled the minutes away while
dim thoughts of elizabeth went
through his mind he began to nod
sleepily he looked at parks parks
was steadily smoking his eyes
lidded jerry put his arms on the
table and went at once into a sound
sleep

  parks opened his eyes and looked
at jerry tamping out his pipe he
softly rose and went to the living-
room door and opened it elizabeth
sprang up and hastened to him

  it aint nothin important eliza-
beth he said ony by now that
unforchinit matter o them hellions
the barking dog



has been attended to i sent a
bunch o the boys up in the hills
with them i didnt want jerry to
mix in that matter

  thanks parks elizabeth said
and closed the door quickly 

chapter ix

act of mercy

jerry awoke in one of the
bunk houses at noon he re-
membered that parks had
roused him in the kitchen and that
he had gone to the bunk house up
for more than thirty hours and used
to regular sleep he had not remem-
bered that a bee was in prospect
it was his first thought now he
went outside and hunted up parks
the punchers heretofore had been
a little offish but his encounter with
the man who had killed shorty
flynn had banished whatever
doubts they had had and they
grinned at him as he yawned his
way past them

  he found parks sitting on the
kitchen steps smoking his pipe
jerry sank down beside him

  you let me sleep while you took
care of them fellas jerry said

  i didnt take care of them some
o the boys did they took care o
them good too you an me wasnt
needed you hadda have your rest
you gotta be strong an ready at all
times jerry

  yeah

elizabeth is fine this mornin
said parks she got some rest too
it was on her account you let
them boys slip away thout me
jerry declared

  might be

  jerry sat looking ahead of him
for a moment his thoughts re-
verted to the scene at the bottom
of the mountain slope he remem-
bered that sick man

  parks he exclaimed did you
take care o that sick young fella
too

  you might not think so but i
got a human streak in me parks
answered that young fella is
lyin in that shed over yonder i
couldnt put him in the bunk house
or take him inta the house he was
coughin his head off when i went
out to the boys las night i dunno
if what hes got is ketchin but i
couldnt take no chances

  hows he this mornin

  not so good he looks like a
ghost i reckon hell be a ghost
afore long i guess he must a swal-
lowed a bucket o live coals some-
time an them coals burned him out
inside o him hes shore burned
out

  nothin we can do for him
naw ive seen two three fellas
in the fix hes in at the end they
jus give a gasp an was gone i got
a puncher in there with him settin
back fm him

  that puncher had been in the
shed but now he came out of it
hastily he was an excited young
man catching sight of jerry and
parks he called to them loudly
they hastened over to him

  that fella is in a bad way the
puncher said i dunno whats hap-
pened him you better have a look
at him parks

  jerry and parks went into the
shed the man lay on a cot which
parks had had carried in there he
was leaning over the edge of it
there was a stain on the floor a wet
rusty stain as the two men entered
the sick man pushed himself from
the edge of the cot and lay on his
back his eyes closed his lips
dropped apart he seemed ex-
hausted parks looked at jerry and
shook his head

  soon jerry asked


street  smiths western story magazine

  pretty quick

  they walked up to the cot and
stood looking down at the man
his face was bloodless his eyes
were sunken and dark-ringed he
lifted a feeble hand and ran it over
his lips then he seemed to become
aware that some one was near him
he slowly opened his eyes

  water he whispered

jerry got a dipper of water
from a pail which stood on the
floor he raised the mans
head and the man took two mouth-
fuls he had difficulty in swallow-
ing as jerry let him back he
caught one of jerrys hands his
eyes were feverish as he looked up
at jerry

 am i goin to pass out he
asked

  it comes to all of us jerry said
i mean am i goin to pass out
right now i got consumption
had it for a year

  son said parks solemnly i
kinda think youre close to the end
o your rope we all gotta meet it
some time or other

  i aint afraid o death the man
declared its stoppin livin that
gets me

  there was jerry declared nothing
contradictory in that the man
appeared to have a feverish love of
life it was clear that he had loved
life-living-too well

  i alius have lived the man con-
firmed that ive had evrything-
whisky gamblin and so forth i
guess i laid myself open to this here
sickness but i thought i could last
till i was thirty forty if i was
forty i wouldnt mind i never did
wanta live after i got old fella
you sure im slippin out

  i dunno what happens after an
attack like this jerry said i

dont know nothin about this busi-
ness but it looks-

  all right a false briskness
came to the man his cheeks were
suddenly bright they had a trans-
parent appearance i gotta tell
you somethin i better get about
it he raised his head slightly
immediately let it fall back jerry
cautioned him not to move yeah
i gotta save my strenth well i
killed that postmaster in town
thats the ony killin i been in
jerry had a moment of gratitude
he was glad that this man now
dying was the slayer of tysons
father his gratitude was on mrs
tysons account her husband
would have to hunt no longer for

that murderer unless-

  who was with you jerry asked
even with the hand of death
reaching out to touch him the man
still was proud

  nobody i wouldnt let nobody
help me in a job like that fact is
i never worked with an outfit before
-till red sent me to join up with
them fools you caught workin
with other men is dangerous in more
ways than one always a chance
somebody will lose his nerve an
squeal i didnt go to the post
office to kill that fella though he
jus stumbled in there when i was
workin on the safe he tol me to
throw up my hands an i let him
have it

  rest a minute jerry said

  he sped from the shed to the
house and threw open the door with-
out knocking he found elizabeth
and mrs tyson at work in the
kitchen

  wheres tyson he asked
instead of answering mrs tyson
went to the door of the other room
and called her husband when
tyson came out he had a gun in
one hand and an oiled rag in the
the barking dog



other he had jerry saw been
cleaning his gun very likely he had
been thinking of the murder of his
father he would associate the
cleaning of a gun with that murder
his hope would be that he would
be able to use the gun for the one
special purpose before long jerry
had another moment of gratitude
he saw mrs tysons eyes grow sad
as she looked at the gun she was
worried because her husband was
constantly dwelling upon his ex-
pected use of it looking about for
the exact man to use it on

  tyson come outside with me
jerry said

he spoke to tyson but he was
looking at mrs tyson he
saw mrs tyson take hold of
herself she might worry about her
husbands longing to meet his
fathers slayer but she would inter-
pose no objection to whatever he
decided to do however jerry saw
that she was constantly afraid that
the next moment would be the dire
one she seemed to be so afraid
now

  just a minute tyson said

  jerry knew that he was going into
the next room to slip cartridges into
that cleaned gun jerry had tried
to be wholly calm but with recol-
lection of that young man in his
mind he had not succeeded a
note a little higher than the rest had
humped itself up in the middle of a
sentence meant to be even

 you wont need your gun
jerry said

  mrs tyson gave jerry a wide-
eyed glad look jerry wanted to
take tyson to the dying man and
let him afterwards tell his wife
what had happened as tyson
started for the door however eliza-
beth walked swiftly up to jerry and
laid a hand on his arm

  what is it jerry she asked
tell me

  she was the girl she had been in
the draw not the girl she had been
in town jerry looked down into her
soft eyes she was asking a favor
of him

  why he said theres a dyin
man outside he hesitated hes
the man that killed tysons father
no tyson you wont need a gun
this fella has gone beyond you
hes that sick man that we caught
up at the mountains when you
take one look at him youll see that
you cant use a gun on him

  for a moment tyson stood with
bent head a frown between his
eyes those eyes on the floor then
he slowly walked over to the table
and placed his gun on it

  come on he said in a thick
voice

  he moved quickly toward the
door opened it and stood there
waiting for jerry elizabeth and
mrs tyson also went to the door

  no jerry said sharply you
two women stay here that mans
terrible sick he may die any
minute it may be a terrible death
parks is out there us three can
handle the matter

  a man dying on my ranch and i
mustnt go to him jerry elizabeth
asked that isnt reasonable
also mrs tyson wants to go with
her husband

  jerry argued no further the four
went to the shed and entered it
the mans too-bright eyes were on
the ceiling parks had been stand-
ing beside him but as the others
came in he stood aside tyson
immediately walked up to the cot
his hands were clasped in front of
him he was pulling at his fingers
and in the sudden silence the sound
his knuckles made was loud


street  smiths western story magazine

  well he whispered to the sick
man

  this is tyson son of the man
you killed jerry put in

  the habit of defiance was firmly
fixed on that man it maintained
itself even in this moment he
turned his too-bright eyes on tyson
and kept them there

  it was all fair enough he de-
clared in a light voice your
father tol he to stick up my hands

nobody but a-a- well he

made a mistake in tellin me to do
that when he didnt have no gun
long ago i promised myself i
wouldnt be took alive red-handed
i turned an plugged him

  for a space tyson seemed unable
to find words the dying mans
proud cruel assertions angered
jerry a little

  you was took red-handed up at
the mountains jerry said

  oh i didnt think that mattered
cow stealin aint nothin

  little you know about it said
parks bitterly them fellas that
you was with found it was some-
thin

  did you string them fellas up
jus for the sake of a few cows the
man asked

  aint you a puncher parks
inquired

  naw i aint never worked since
i can remember im a rider ive
rode in evry state where a man can
ride free an easy

  why did you go to the post
office tyson demanded

  i was lookin for a letter virlee

when the post-office job come up
he tol me to do it i said i would
when i met the man i was workin

he could be independent if he hadda

  virlee tol me that he was ex-
pectin a letter to come to the post
office for parks he wanted to get
the letter i went to the post office
five times in the night but found
no letter las time virlee said

no barking dog rider had been re-
ported to him as bein in town for a
long time

  i see how that was parks said

out what i was up to

  virlee genally had a man hangin
around the post office especially

what else do you know jerry
put in do you know who killed
treece or king

  dont know a thing about the
king business i spose virlee had
king killed they was pardners
virlee aint the kind of man that
likes to split profits his profits
was growin but so was his expenses
i guess he figgered there wasnt
enough cornin in for two

  what else jerry asked

a sudden change came over
the man his strength
seemed to increase he
raised himself on an elbow and
stared at jerry with eyes that now
the barking dog



burned they were hotly alive in a
face that was now gray

  theres a fella round here some
place that you might look up he
said when he aint workin he
hangs around virlees saloon he
calls hisself a trailer me im a
trailer if i couldnt play the game

country virlee bent hisself double
before that banker he tof him to

  what does he look like jerry
asked

  built like a lath got a pair of
these here muddy-blue eyes black
hair though hook nose you cant
miss him

  youre sure theres nothin else
jerry asked

  cant think o nothin

  he was still up on his elbow sud-
denly there was a catch in his throat
his eyes protruded he began to
cough the coughing tore his lungs
shook his whole body

  jerry placed an arm about the
mans shoulders he was afraid
there would be another hemorrhage
there was none the coughing
grew less violent elizabeth wet her
handkerchief and handed it to
jerry jerry wiped the mans now
hot face

 anybody you wanta send word
to jerry asked

  the man smiled very slightly
then made a little sound of disgust
in his throat jerry let him back
immediately the man was seized
with a terrible air hunger his slight
smile had still been on his lips when
jerry had let him down it died
now and a look of fear came into
his eyes jerry moved to lift him

  let me said tyson at jerrys
side

  jerry moved swiftly away tyson
leaning lifted the sick man the
sick man was sucking in air between
parted lips jerry saw a shudder go
through tyson and then jerry knew
that tyson was doing this for his
wifes sake she knew it too she
moved up to her husbands side
elizabeth moving back to jerry

  elizabeth stood erect the sick
man was slipping out jerry knew
that elizabeth quick as she was to
any emotion was sorry for the man


street  smiths western story magazine

but she did not seek sympathy for
herself or support she did not
reach for jerrys hand

  trailer said the man quite
clearly scornfully

  then he died-gasped and died

tyson let him back and stood
up wiping sweat from his
face he did not look at the
dead man he turned and got un-
certainly into the open air his
wife followed him elizabeth ap-
proached the cot and drew the
blanket over the mans face she
stood up

  trailer she said hes on a
longer trail than hes ever been on
before i hope the sign leads him
to some safe place

  she too went outside

  if that fella follas any sign hell
folia it to hell said parks hardily
he knowed he was dyin he died
proud he died tellin us how to get
to a man he hated thats what i
despise in these men-their hate an
their pride i guess this fella was
a trailer all right he couldnt bear
to see another trailer brought in
jealous died jealous whats the
use o hopin anything for him
shucks

  jerry hardly listened to the old
mans philippic when parks turned
to him he found him staring at the
floor the old man was really sorry
for the trailer he was sorry for any
one who died young death was
for the old he held he was grow-
ing old presently death would be
welcome but he would leave behind
him a pretty good life

jerry he asked testily

tended to do

returned into the house

headed roan o course not much
for looks but hell die on his feet

  they went down to the corral and
got the roan parks had not had
him ready he seemed to have been
saving him for an emergency a
little time was lost in getting saddle
and bridle on him then as jerry
rode down toward the house there
was another delay the man whom
parks had sent to virlee rode in

  i give your letter to virlee his
own self the man reported i

peared in the kitchen door

asked

  i thought he was in the other
room he isnt he must have
gone round the house and got a
horse oh hes gone to town

  to get virlee parks exclaimed
the words popping from his lips be-
fore he could check them

chapter x

in town

jerry reached nugget city
just after nightfall he had
ridden the roan horse hard and
fast for the most part he had
kept out in the flat for he had sup-
posed that tyson would keep to it
then not overtaking tyson he had
concluded that tyson had ridden in
toward the hills that would delay
him somewhat and jerry hoped to
reach town ahead of him

  jerry encountered no riders in the
street when riders came in the
saloons soon took them that di-
versified flow of humanity was again
moving along the sidewalk as he
rode down to virlees place jerry
scanned the men however he
looked in vain for such a person as
the dying man had described

  when he reached virlees place
jerry did not hesitate he knew
that the big man would have him
killed if he could but he would
probably not do it here he was

not forthright enough for that of
course some hanger-on might pick
a quarrel but jerry was confident
he could take care of such a cus-
tomer virlee would not permit any
one to shoot him in the back virlee
could not get away with a witnessed
murder there were many decent
men among the miners

  jerry pushed open the doors and
walked into the barroom at the
side of one end there was a long bar
customers two deep stood in front
of it they were all gay virlees
whisky was already beginning to
take effect

  at the other end of the big room
was the dance hall and in between
the gambling paraphernalia crowds
of men and women were about the
tables the men hazarding whatever
stakes they could afford the women
awaiting a winning play

 jerry went about among the
tables no one seemed to pay any
attention to him if virlee had
made a marked man of him the men
for whom he had been marked were
not here or they were sly he went
on to the dance floor a square
dance was on jerry could not pick
out the trailer from among those
bowing scraping figures and of
course tyson was not there

 jerry went outside to await
tysons arrival he leaned back
against the logs of the building and
rolled and lighted a cigarette the
light of the match still dimmed his
eyes when he saw the saloon door
opened a man emerged he was
a young man with a springy step
short but lean he looked care-
lessly past jerry and then leaned
up against the logs on the other
side of the door jerry stared out
into the street out of the corner
of an eye he could see the man give
him a quick glance jerry quickly
turned his head before the man


street  smiths western story magazine

could turn his own head which he
did as quickly as jerry had done
the two mens eyes met jerry was
convinced that the fellow was one
of virlees killers and that he knew
who jerry was he was spying on
him

  jerrys ready anger boiled up
this might be the man who had
killed treece he might even be the
man who had killed king and yet
he stood here insolently he lived
a life of ease while that old cow-
man lay in his grave this fellow
had food shelter whisky-every-
thing that his black heart desired
elizabeth was fatherless jerrys
anger flooded up he found his
mouth dry he cast the cigarette
from him with a violent motion he
slightly turned toward the man

  he was stayed by the arrival of
half a dozen miners they had
apparently visited several saloons
their faces were almost as red as
their shirts they spoke to the man
beyond the door having reached
him first and then they spoke to
jerry with waves of their hands

  a little behind them five punchers
arrived they seemed just to have
reached town they spoke neither
to jerry nor to the other man they
were in what to them was a big
town and they were cautious on
their guard jerry guessed that they
had come from ranches on the other
side of town if they had come
from the barking dog country it
was unlikely that they would have
gone to virlees jerry was sure that
something of virlees reputation
must have gone all over that land

jerry looked down the street
no one was within a hundred
feet of this place jerrys anger
had not cooled it could not cool
when that killer stood so insolently
there and of the anger one of those

impulses which jerry was forever
feeling was bom he walked up to
the man and stood in front of him

  well he snapped

  well what cowboy

  the man said that with a curl of
his thin lips a man having his
quarrel just was thrice armed this
killer seemed to think himself thrice
armed because he was on his own
ground with heaven only knew how
many of his own kind near by
jerry became lost in his rage he
gathered up a handful of the mans
shirt with his left hand whirled him
about to the edge of the platform
and struck him on the point of the
jaw loosing his hold at the same
time the man was knocked out
into the street

  jerry cooled a little damn it he
had acted too hastily he had done
the very thing against which his
father had warned him he must
do something with this fellow
what below him there was a
sound on the board sidewalk glanc-
ing there he found three cowboys
approaching they must have been
in town for some time for they
walked three abreast their arms
locked

  one of them caught sight of the
still body on the ground he
walked unsteadily up to it and
stirred it with a toe of his boot
then he glanced up at jerry he
said whuz masser cowboy the
two other punchers approached the
first and they looked up at jerry
owlishly

  ive got myself inta a kind of a
jam jerry said quickly do me
a favor

  they sobered slightly and asserted
that they would go through hell and
high water for jerry

 take that fella back to the
stable an tie him up an gag him
jerry said i cant leave this door
the barking dog



   spleasur the first puncher
said

  among them the three managed
to lift the man and they disappeared
around the corner of the building
jerry returned to his former posi-
tion promising himself not to lose
his temper again to-night

  he stood there for ten minutes
in that time another dozen punchers
arrived jerry guessed that a bunch
of them had come in from the other
country

 and then tyson arrived he
came swiftly along the board walk
jerry caught sight of him when he
was a hundred feet away he was
coming forward with bent head el-
bowing those who got in his way
some regarded him angrily others
spoke to him probably angrily ask-
ing him who he thought he was
tyson paid no attention jerry
knew that he was lost in himself

  when tyson came up on the plat-
form he did not see jerry jerry
guessed that he was seeing only with
his minds eye-and virlee was
occupying that minds eye to the ex-
clusion of everything else tyson
did not hesitate he pushed open
the doors and fairly plunged into the
room

  jerry followed him tyson did
not look along the big room at the
gamblers at the dancers he
walked swiftly up to the bar with
jerry close behind him he reached
that double row of drinkers he
pushed in between four of them
the bartender was serving drinks
just at that spot tyson leaned
over the bar his clenched right fist
lying on it jerry could see the cords
in his neck stand out

  wheres virlee tyson asked in
a low voice

  the bartender stared at him be-
cause tyson had been the post-
master the bartender knew him

  he aint here tyson the bar-
tender said

tysons hand was swiftly

removed from the bar it

shot down and when it came

up it held one of his guns the

gun was aimed at the bartenders

chest the bartender retreated to

the back bar a glass in one hand

and a bottle in the other he looked

sick tyson kept his gun on him

  a sound behind jerry caused him

to turn six punchers had come up

behind him five more at once

arrived the men on either side of

tyson stepped out and back there

was about him a cleared space the

eleven punchers said nothing they

merely stood there staring stonily

at that bartender they only knew

that a man in punchers garb was

pullin somethin off

  honest virlee aint here tyson

the bartender said he aint been

here all day

  wheres his sleepin room

  why he dont live here hei

lives down the street you oughtai

know that you oughta know

where his house is

  jerry saw tyson draw his left

hand over his eyes and down his

face he was like a man coming

out of a dream

  thats right he said i know

  that something was happening

in the barroom must have been

communicated to the gamblers and

the dancers the fiddles were

abruptly silent a hush went all

through the room three men

moved out from a table thev

                                                                    

were jerry saw the same kind of
men as he whom jerry had struck
jerry pushed his way among the
grouped punchers they turned so
that they were once more behind
him their faces toward him jerry
stood looking at those three men


street  smiths western story magazine

his hands on his hips the punchers
divided and lined up on each side
of him very slowly those three
men returned to the table but they
continued to look at jerry and the
punchers

  tyson turned away from the bar
and started for the door jerry
spoke to him rather loudly for he
wanted every one here to know that
he was backing tyson to prove
that they were too the eleven
punchers moved toward tyson
jerrys eyes swept the length of the
room none of the armed men that
virlee must have had there seemed
prepared to act

  come on tyson jerry said
well go with you

  leave me alone tyson ground
out i hadda slip away from my
wife im lookin for virlee you
know why virlee sent that fella to
the post office

  he went on toward the door be-
fore he gained it the door was
opened and three more punchers
came in they were grinning their
grins were at once explained the
door was thrown wide and that
man whom jerry had struck a gun
in each hand stood in the doorway
tyson was between him and jerry
the man leaned to one side caught
sight of jerry jerry went for one
of his guns the man lifted his
right hand jerry saw a dark face
blazing with his rage

  then there was a shot it was
not fired by that killer his gun
clattered on the floor he pitched
forward on his face jerry glanced
in the direction from which the shot
had been fired two punchers stood
there one was just returning his
gun to its holster the two then
each glancing from side to side ad-
vanced on jerry

  he was goin to get you fella
the man who had fired said gruffly

i dunno what your jam is but we
all better get outta here

 the punchers who had entered
grinning approached jerry also

  we found that fella bound in the
stable one said i reckon we
made a mistake in freein him
well back you up

those eleven punchers had
drawn their guns when the
man had fired they formed
themselves into a half circle so that
they could cover the bar and the
gambling space tyson still had his
gun in his hand the other punchers
drew their guns all the men began
a slow retreat to the door when
they all reached it jerry stepped
out

  nobody better leave this place
in the next hour he called well
have men front an rear a bunch
of you cant come out well put
bullets inta any that try to come
we wont stop to warn anybody

  two punchers went through the
doorway they held the doors open
the others passed swiftly through
jerry the last jumped through

  we gotta get our horses from the
stable one of the punchers who had
grinned said

  they ran around the corner of the
building and several other men fol-
lowed them jerry opened the door
three times and looked inside be-
fore those punchers returned then
others said their horses were down
the street jerry told them to get
the animals mount and wait for
him and the others the remaining
horses were at the rack where
jerrys was

  up with me tyson jerry said

  tyson mounted behind him and
he and the punchers rode to the far
side of the street and went along it
they were quickly joined by the
riders who had left in front of a

ws-b
the barking dog



dark store tyson mounted his own
horse

  youre goin to virlees house
tyson jerry asked

  if you dont stop me

  i aint stoppin you i guess
virlee belongs to you id like to
see him live a little longer account
o king but it dont much matter
other men know who killed king
i cant let virlee go on livin
virlee had his father killed-
well in a way jerry told the
punchers

  nobodys cornin outta that place
yet a puncher who had been
looking down the street said but
you cant tell how long theyll
believe were outside we better
work fast

  tyson sent his spurred horse out
into the street the riders were
sufficiently distant from virlees
place so that the horses would not
be heard the men rode rapidly till
tyson turned in at a house he
and the others flung themselves
down and went up to the front door

  better go kinda easy now fella
a puncher advised

  they stood and listened the
sound of a woman singing in a low
voice came to them tyson put out
a hand and pressed the latch the
singing continued and grew louder
when tyson began slowly to push
the door ajar when it was suffi-
ciently ajar so that the men could
see into the room they caught sight
of a womans light bright hair as it
rose above the top of a rocking-
chair with jerry behind him
tyson stepped up on the threshold
no one else was in the room

  the woman must have felt a stir
of air about her head for she looked
around and then sprang swiftly to
her feet her bright hair was her
only claim to beauty she was stout
and sallow her fright was great
ws-b

  as she stood there staring a door
behind her was opened and another
woman appeared in the doorway
as some such women were she was
pretty in fact she had a kind of
dark wild beauty her eyes were
big and brown and an abundance
of brown hair was wound around
her head in braids

  what do you want she asked
sharply

 didnt mean to disturb you
maam tyson said

  this was only an imitation of a
home but to tyson any kind of
home was some kind of home

  were lookin for virlee he
added

  virlee isnt here the dark
woman said ony me an the
housekeeper is here

  maam excuse me said tyson
i gotta look

  you aint goin to prowl through
my house

  youre mrs virlee aint you
im mrs virlee yes why you
blockhead you delivered a letter to
me under that name once

  i remember now tyson said
well maam im lookin for your
husband i gotta go through your
house take me ony a minute
dont you lift a foot

  yes maam i gotta

he advanced into the room
jerry followed him this
was rotten business but
jerry knew that tyson had to find
virlee to-night if he could to-
morrow he might think too hard of
his wife and be turned aside even
in virlees place he had spoken of
his wife his rage had been com-
pounded partly of hatred of virlee
and partly of regret that he had had
to run away from his wife

  several of the punchers stepped
into the room glancing through


street  smiths western story magazine

the open door jerry saw several
others start for the corner of the
house he knew they were going to
the rear of the house to make sure
that virlee did not slide through the
rear door

  the dark woman let tyson and
the others take three steps toward
her then she stepped back and
slammed the door they could hear
her running away from it jerry
and tyson ran and threw open the
door down a hall another door
was slammed when they reached
it it was locked

  maam said tyson in a wrung
voice please open the door i
wouldnt hurt you for anything i
gotta see if virlee is in there
maam i just gotta get virlee to-
night im goin to kill him maam
i gotta do it

  get away from that door the
woman cried this is my room
you cant come in here

  i gotta maam i gotta see if
virlee is there

  you cant come in i got a gun
ill shoot you i got a right to
shoot you

  tyson stepped back to the far
wall as he was about to throw
himself against the door the key
clicked tyson held himself crouch-
ing against the wall the door was
opened and a man stood in the
doorway

  why dont you do somethin
the woman in the room demanded

  i cant fight a dozen men this
man said whatcha want boys
stand aside an lemmer go in
tyson said

  the man stood aside his gun
in his hand tyson advanced into
the room he searched it but failed
to find virlee jerry thought that
dark woman must have attacks of
hysteria as tyson searched she
continued to assert that he could

not prowl through her house that he
could not search her room

  my sister is kinda disturbed be-
cause virlee has left town the man
explained

  jerry leaning back against the
wall had been studying him he
was very tall very thin in his
darkness he somewhat resembled the
woman and he was capable of
fawning he looked at jerry and
smiled showing those white teeth
which very dark persons usually
have

  its a fac that virlee is outta
town he said he come home in
a hurry before daylight an said he
hadda go away he didnt explain

he-

 no he didnt explain the
woman broke in he never ex-
plains nothin to me no more time
was when he tol me everything
hes left me thats what hes done
an now you fellas come bustin inta
my house

  jerry saw that her excitement her
opposition had been caused by
anger and grief a hot-headed
woman she had to vent her anger
on some one

  you a puncher jerry asked the
man

  no im a trailer

  you can trail along with us
jerry said coldly

chapter xi

persuasion

rs virlee darted past
the men into the hall
screaming she ran down it
jerry did not know what to do
the trailer did he had seemed
little worried by jerrys statement

  lemme get her he said ill
quiet her

 he pursued the woman and
caught her in the front room he
the barking dog



seized her shoulders and pushed her
into a chair

  want me to slap your face he
demanded stop your noise an
listen to me

  he was brutal his dark face was
twisted as he leaned down to the
woman jerry registered that
against him a man who would
treat a woman so deserved to be
treated even more sternly jerry
declared he would break the fellows
neck if he didnt come fast and
clean

  but virlees gone the woman
whimpered now theyre goin to
take you away ill be all alone

  that organ note in virlees voice
would be music in the ears of such
a woman jerry knew probably
everything about him appealed to
her his size his wet eyes his flash-
ing diamonds the power he had
displayed jerry was sorry for her

  they cant take me away the
trailer declared

  we better be gettin outta here
jerry tyson said virlees men
aint goin to keep holed up all
night

  the men went into the front
room

  come outside fella jerry said
let your sister get quiet youre
ony fussin her up

  the woman stared at jerry with
stricken eyes he wished he did not
have to take the trailer along but
he could not relent the man was
one of virlees hirelings he was re-
lated to virlee by marriage if any
one was in the big mans confidence
he should be

  set right where you are sis
the trailer said ill be back in a
minute these fellas cant take me
away they cant do nothin to me

  the woman relaxed in her chair
she seemed to have great confidence
in her brother all of a sudden

jerry thought she had remembered
something about him they took
the trailer outside

  not a sound from you jerry
said wheres your horse dont
speak point

  the trailer walked to the corner
of the house and pointed to a small
stable in the rear he seemed to
feel so secure that he was ready to
do anything he was told to do a
puncher ran back to the stable and
brought out a horse with its gear
already on it jerry ordered the
trailer to mount

  but- the trailer began

 shut up weve wasted too
much time already

  they were all presently in the
road mounted mrs virlee came to
the door when she saw that her
brother was about to be taken
away she began to scream again
jerry felt shamed damn it this was
no way to treat a woman then he
thought of elizabeths dead father
he had to take what he could get
the woman would survive to his
relief she proved that she was think-
ing more of virlee than of her
brother suddenly she stopped
screaming

  you keep your mouth shut you
hear me she called to the trailer

  the trailer was silent but he
seemed to have lost none of his con-
fidence jerry opened his lips to tell
the men to ride he did not speak
there was a pounding behind him
glancing over his shoulder he saw
that a big body of riders was bear-
ing down on him and these men
virlees hirelings had at last found
courage to leave the saloon and get
horses as those riders came on
jerry saw red-shirted men among
them those were worn by miners
he could not kill a miner

  ride he called
street  smiths western story magazine

he struck the trailers horse
and as it leaped forward he
swung in behind it most
of the men followed him then be-
hind jerry there were three shots
a trio of punchers had refused
flight till they had shown their de-
fiance again glancing back jerry
saw them start their horses all
these riders except the trailer
ducked low in their saddles bullets
passed over their heads one went
so close to the trailer that he ducked

  the chase was brief these riders
all rode hard horses under the
saddle every day those men back
there rode town horses which not
infrequently were in stables long
hour after long hour they de-
veloped soft kidneys they had no
stamina jerry saw the gap widen
then the pursuers were dim figures
and at last they were gone alto-
gether for a while jerry kept to
the fast pace when the party was
well out in the flat he slowed down
then stopped

  well he said were much
obliged to you boys whatre you
goin to do you cant go back to
nugget city

  some of us turn off here a
puncher said we live in the back
country well go on with you if
you can use us

  not necessary well be all
right slong

  so long

  all but three of the men turned
off the road and departed in a
direction opposite that which led to
the bar k

  what you three goin to do
jerry asked

  we rode in here lookin for jobs
a man said

  i could use you said jerry but
you can see we got a war on we
might even have a fight before we
got home

account of ourselves so far the
man drawled but we might

thing should come of it i spose

  never mind about him jerry
said he works for virlee

  well we can go on with you or

butte jerry called a halt and
turned to the trailer

  you can loosen up your tongue

fore i come

sick to trail for a mile

jerry then you could lose the

a startled look came into
the mans eyes jerry thought
he believed himself too cute
to have been caught he was taken
aback when he found that jerry
knew what he had done
the barking dog



  that fella that called hisself a
trailer tol you that he said he

  they rode to the ranch and jerry
got hold of parks when these men
had been fed parks ordered a score
of men up taking the trailer along
they rode toward the mountains
they went up the slope at the foot
of which the battle had been fought
the punchers who had taken the
fourteen virlee men into the moun-
tains and had not brought them
back had disposed of the bodies of
the men who had been killed here

  parks and jerry stopped the
other riders circled those two and
the trailer in a low even voice
parks told the trailer what had hap-
pened here the trailer wet his lips
stared around

  but all that aint nothin to
you parks said up the slope
with you

  all that proved to be something
to the trailer as he went up the
slope ahead of jerry and parks the
other men following he cast uneasy
glances from side to side however
he seemed to think he was in no
immediate danger and he did not
speak

when the party reached the
top of the slope they
passed among conifers and
entered a mountain clearing parks
led the men across the clearing and
stopped before them was a canyon


street  smiths western story magazine

it was three hundred feet across and
it had steep rocky sides

  the sun was now well up and its
light beat down into the clearing
parks looked down into the canyon
all the men followed his example
as- if the canyon held whatever old
parks had brought them here to
see the far wall was illuminated
by the light from the mounting sun
the wall below the men was
shadow-painted those shadows
extended a little way out from the
wall

  take a good look parks told
the trailer

  the trailer was apparently not
afraid of height he leaned over his
horn and stared into the depths
he saw nothing unusual only
silence greeted his ears however
he was still uneasy he seemed
convinced that a man like parks
would not play with him

  i dont see nothin he said

  no parks asked as if in sur-
prise well well aint it a sight
in the world how a man will forget
what hes doin i reckon i must
be growin old i didnt mean for
you to look inta the canyon fella
but jus keep your eyes down there
for a minute jerry gimme your
rope

  jerry took up his rope but held
it in his hand

  with you a rope is like a saddle
huh parks said its a personal
thing all right now trailer take
a good look at jerry hawleys rope
keep your eyes on it till i tell you to
take them away

  the trailer looked at the rope

  you cant hang me he said
sullenly

  youre gettin worried huh
parks asked go right ahead
well below the far wall of the
canyon theys a slope like the one
we jus come up recent a bunch

of men rode up that other slope
fourteen of em didnt come back
virlees men fella if you think
they come back jus take a look
over there

  the trailer looked first at parks
the old man was staring across the
canyon his face was stony the
trailer dropped his eyes to the can-
yon then very slowly he let them
climb the wall when those eyes
reached the top of the wall the
mans face was at once ghastly from
fear and shock his body trembled
he put a hand over his eyes to shut
out the horror of decorated trees
when he took the hand away he
turned fully to parks

   man he whispered ill tell
you all i know

  why should you parks asked
  ill tell you i wanta tell you
  tell us what

  everything ony lets get away
from here

  i like this canyon parks said
i can come here an still feel my-
self yofcng many a time in days
gone by ive sat my horse here an
thought of a lotta things i wont
leave till i start for home

  all right all right well virlee

why he spoke the names of two
of the men that was in the outfit

sneered

bullet inta treece was smylie
gunman fastern light could
shoot a flys eye out

  an who parks whispered

the barking dog



  i dont know i swear i dont
know virlee didnt tell me

  jerry lifted his rope a little
higher the trailer gave it an
agonized glance

  if i knowed id tell you he
cried i wanta get even with
virlee hes gone an he aint paid
me hes left my sister with nothin
she went to his saloon to get some
money an they top her shed hafta
wait till virlee got back why she

banker has been payin me ony
trailers wages i could ony have
a little fun around virlees place
with that

  where does this smylie hang

  he dont come to town hes

helpin with the cow business
evrybody thats been on the
warpath works for virlee then
cernly men in town men
out here a whole lot o men out
here hunderd mebbe here an
there

  do you think virlee might be
hidin in the mountains jerry
asked

  hadnt thought of it might
easy be i reckon he wouldnt leave
what hes got here but if hes hid
hes hid deep he aint a fightin
man he aint used to hardship
hell he aint nothin but a big bag
o wind

  i guess thats all for this fella
jerry parks said

  guess so jerry agreed
lemme go will you the trailer
pleaded ill ride to town get my
sister and go back to idaho no-
bodyll ever see us again

  ill get some money to your
sister to-night jerry promised

ill look after her we aint makin
no war on women

  but lemme ride i cant stay
here now virlee will have me
killed

  dont be silly parks said
well jerry we better be gettin
back home

jerry nodded parks the
trailer and all the other men
turned their horses jerry gave
the other side of the canyon one
look he went rigid in his saddle
a rider had come upon that scene
he was gazing up at those decorated
trees as jerry watched him he
took off his hat it was no gesture
of regret the man merely scratched
his head

  in the sunlight his hair was al-
most the color of blood

 jerry sat staring the man
stopped his horse as he did so he
looked across the canyon and saw
jerry and the others for only an
instant he gazed a motionless
figure a man of steady nerves
jerry said

  jerry did not want parks or any
of those others to see that red-haired
man he was second only to virlee
in all this business out here where
cows were being driven away by the
hundreds he was second to no one
jerry was afraid parks would
immediately fire at him that
would mean a volley from the other
men that red-haired man might
be riddled then his lips would be
forever silenced report of him
must have gone among these men
these punchers as incensed by the
cow thefts as parks himself was
would want to blast him out of the
picture

  as jerry slowly brought his horse
about keeping his eyes on the man
the man spurred his horse there


street  smiths western story magazine

was a faint rattle of hoofs all the
men turned in their seats

  whos that parks cried drag-
ging his gun

  he did not wait for an answer
he sent a bullet after the fleeing
man the punchers fired but the
red-haired man was gone among the
trees in a moment the sound of
his horses hoofs died away

  that bloody-headed fella parks
snarled got away from us no
use to try to folia him like huntin
a rattler in tall grass

  jerry was glad that that red-
headed man had escaped he
wanted to keep him for himself for
jerry knew his kind he would not
work in the dark he would make
virlee tell him everything once he
was made to talk the whole story
would be told old parks was so
violently angry and disappointed
that jerry communicated that to
him

  i guess thats right parks
agreed and was mollified

  just as they were about to pass
among the conifers to gain the head
of the slope jerry once more looked
back again he went rigid in his
seat but this time he spoke to
parks parks and the other men
stopped jerry pointed across the
canyon

  a dozen men had come to those
trees and halted they were staring
up at the trees presently they
moved on jerry saw that true to
his habit the red-haired one had
been riding alone these men had
followed after

  dont shoot jerry breathed

 no parks agreed dont
make a sound i think them fellas
is on their way to the genrul hide-
out

  well go after them jerry said

  right now

  right now

  good enough parks said

  when those riders had passed
from view these men moved on
they passed down this slope and
rode around to the slope up which
those men must recently have come

  climbing this they arrived in
front of the decorated trees jerry
the other men with him stopped
his horse

  les ride on the trailer shiv-
ered

  fella jerry said earnestly
youre goin to do some trailin
now an it better be good trailin

  it will be it will be the
trailers shiver became a shudder i
dont wanta hafta join the men on
them trees

chapter xii

corralled

f or a while no trailing was
necessary there was only
one place where the men
could have ridden an so only one
place where these men could ride
that was ten feet away from the
canyons edge opposite the sheer
drop there was a slight rise conifer-
studded

  at last the canyon broke away to
the right before these riders there
was adescent running away from
the canyon as far as jerry could see
on that descent the trees were so
few that he could stare among them
to the bottom down there lay a
narrow valley into which the canyon
flowed diagonally beyond the val-
ley the mountains again lifted them-
selves

  with all the riders behind him
jerry sat looking beyond the val-
leys floor there were several
draws into any one of which the
other riders might have disappeared
at length jerry turned to the trailer
he did not speak his eyes merely
the barking dog



coldly ordered the trailer to get

busy

  the trailer dismounted the
formation was lightly covered with
clinging soil the trailer had no
difficulty in following the riders
down the descent for a hundred feet
then he climbed back to jerry

  they went straight down that
far he said just ahead of where
i stopped rock begins its goin to
be harder to folia them you aint
goin to send me all the way down
there alone are you if them fellas
kept on they went inta the draw
you can see down there

  ill go with you jerry said
you an him aint goin down
there alone jerry parks declared

  we gotta locate them fellas
said jerry we dont know what
any of them draws is they may
run through they may be blind
them fellas might be in one of them
cernly they aint above us if we
keep away from the mouths of the
draws well be all right you men
can stay here if anything happens
ill throw myself flat you can pick
them off from here

  well mebbe thats all right
parks conceded look out for
yourself look out for this trailer
hell outfox you if he can

  an where would i go from
there the trailer demanded if
them fellas caught me they
wouldnt lemme explain theyd
smash bullets inta me theyd say
i brought you men here an thatd
be all thered be to it i know em
jerry slipped from his horse and
led it to one side so that it should
not be between the punchers and the
bottom of the descent he examined
his two guns

  go on he told the trailer
tend to your business if you
make a break of any kind ill blast

you even if my shot brings that
whole outfit out on me

  im in as much danger as you
are the trailer said sullenly

  they went as rapidly as possible
down to the spot to which the
trailer had previously gone the
trailer stood looking farther down
fifty feet from him and jerry there
was a clump of half a dozen trees
the space between each two was
sufficiently wide to permit a rider
to pass between them jerry and
the trailer went down there jerry
keeping his eyes on the bottom and
the trailer staring at the trees

  when they reached the trees the
trailer began to examine them
jerry now watched the mouth of the
draw below him

  some riders went through these
trees recent some around them the
trailer presently announced horses
dragged the branches of the trees
a few dry branches is broke they
come away clean an are layin on
the ground one green branch
broke too the green branch is the
thing the break is fresh as a new
cut

  lets see it jerry ordered

the trailer pushed a limb
toward jerry jerry saw
that one of the branching
ends was broken and hung down
the break was indeed fresh it had
been made very recently he was
convinced that it had been made
by those descending riders com-
ing up the descent they would
probably ride cautiously going
down they would be in haste to get
to security and food

  go on jerry said

  shes clear from here down the
trailer said nervously what hap-
pens to us if them fellas has got a
guard out

  no more will happen to you than


street  smiths western story magazine

to me jerry informed him go
on

  the trailer went on for fifty feet
more jerry felt the rock the
foundation of the higher land be-
come harder under his feet the
descent was at once steeper though
not too steep to permit a horse to
negotiate it

  stopping the trailer knelt jerry
saw that he was expert in his busi-
ness he knew that there might be
a slight sign when the horses were
handled by their riders as the ani-
mals started down the steeper way

  still goin down the trailer said

  jerry stared down at what the
trailer was looking at he was
gently running a forefinger through
rock dust

  horse slipped an slid here i
think he said recent too a
little breeze would blow this dust
away aint been no breeze for a
while

  go on jerry said once more

  the trailer was unable to pick up
the sign again till they reached the
floor of the valley here it was
plain enough and it led straight into
a narrow draw jerry had sent the
trailer to one side of the mouth and
he briefly stood and listened there
was no sound from within the draw
telling the trailer to remain where
he was without stirring jerry crept
to the mouth of the draw it ran
away from him for twenty-five feet
and then turned abruptly jerry
beckoned to the trailer

  follow the sign in there he
ordered if you can pick it up for
ten feet thatll do

 but-

  hurry up

  if theres a guard beyond that
bend hell hear me

  he wont hear a trailer like you
well ill go in right behind you i

dont want you to do what i
wouldnt do

  no you stay here youll make
a noise if id knowed what i was
goin up against id have brought
moccasins i better take off my
boots

youre wastin time an there
aint no time to waste slide in
the trailer slid in pushing his
feet along soundlessly in a few
seconds he was back at jerrys side
they went in there he said
go back to the men jerry
ordered ill have a gun on you

if you make a noise-

  the trailer did not stop to argue
he seemed only to want to get out
of there soundlessly he left jerry
and wentup the descent as sound-
lessly jerry saw him rejoin parks
and the punchers for a moment
jerry looked up at all those men
he had no feeling of farewell he
was merely matter-of-factly esti-
mating how good a chance those
men up there would have of getting
attackers of himself down here the
chance he decided was excellent
bullets from six-guns would still
have a lethal quality when they
reached the bottom of the descent

stepping away from the
mouth of the draw jerry drew
off his boots then he re-
turned to the mouth of the draw
and stood listening no whisper of
sound reached him he believed
that if there were slight sounds be-
yond him somewhere they would
have died before he heard them-
due to the draws breaking off

  he went slowly into the draw

  he knew that he had not made
the slightest sound when he was just
this side of the turn if those men
had any one on guard he was aware
that the guard would probably be
just beyond the turn since he had
the barking dog



not been outside or within the first
of the draw he listened for a
whisper the sound of breathing
anything at last he was convinced
that no one was immediately beyond
him nevertheless he remained
cautious kneeling and removing
his hat he poked out his head his
eyes fell upon a wall he was at an
angle in the draw it ran for no
more than four feet and then turned
in the direction in which it had first
run

  he crept along those four feet
and again poked out his head the
draw ran straight to his left at the
end of it was a spreading space and
beyond the spreading space a slop-
ing mountain wall neither horse
nor man was in sight that how-
ever did not lead jerry to believe
that no one was in that spreading
space if those men had ridden in
here they would remove their
horses and themselves to one side
so that any one entering the draw
could not see them

  jerry decided to go along the rest
of the draw he knew that his
danger would be increased but he
could not turn back now he had
to learn what was beyond him

  he thought a long time passed
before he came to the end of the
draw five feet this side of that end
he again stopped to listen at first
there was no sound then a horse
shook itself jerry believed that
this was a regular retreat for this
part of virlees outfit for when the
horse shook itself there was no
rattle of gear bridle and saddle
had been removed from that horse
and probably from the others

  jerry knew that common sense
urged that he withdraw a horse
was within that space that meant
that a rider was probably there one
rider would not be there alone
unless--

  jerrys heart almost stopped beat-
ing perhaps that red-headed
fellow was in there alone

  that was only an added incentive
for having a look jerry went prone
and rolling his arms under him
noiselessly went up to the end of the
draw slowly he pushed out his
head quickly withdrew it that
one quick glance had been sufficient
he saw that the draw and the space
beyond it made a frying pan with
a crooked handle the space was
round with no entrance save this
in a way that was favorable to these
men they had only one entrance
to watch but also they had only
one exit with the one entrance
blocked they would be securely
corralled

  jerry had arrived at a time set
for his success a score of men
were within that inclosure they
were eating a cold meal without
coffee they were so cautious that
they had not built a fire they
must have been ravenously eating
their eyes on their food

  so far as jerry had been able to
see the red-haired man that lone
rider was not among them appar-
ently he never hunted with the pack
proud probably jerry scorned of
being a lone wolf

  jerry slowly retraced his steps
as he went along the draw toward
the angle he looked up he saw
that mountains broke down to a
shelf if he and the other men
could gain that shelf they could
hold up the men in the pan

  gaining the outside jerry drew
on his boots and looked up the
mounted men up there had been so
concerned about him that they had
sent their horses to the very begin-
ning of the descent if anything
had happened to him within their
sight or if he had not soon re-


street  smiths western story magazine

appeared they would have sent
their horses sliding down that
descent

jerry stood up lifted a hand
and made a circular downward
motion with it the men
slipped from their horses in
another circular movement he swept
his hand in to his chest and then
held it up palm outward

  all the men began a slow careful
movement down toward where he
waited when they reached him he
explained what the situation was
placing three men on each side of
the draw he took the others along
the wall to a second draw this ran
straight in and stopped-a blind
the men walked along it when
they came to the end of it they
found that a man could not climb
to the shelf unaided

  jerry studied the shelf as it ran
out over the pan it was flat and
would accommodate a large number
of men also it ran back in the
shelter of the wall there was room
on the run-back however for no
more than six men

  boost me up there jerry told
two punchers

  they heaved him up they they
heaved up four other men parks
stepped forward jerry could not
forbid him he had a right to be
in on everything in a moment
more the six men stood precariously
on the shelf it was too narrow here
to permit more than one man to step
along at one time jerry being
nearest the broadening moved out
he found himself in no immediate
danger the shelf was greater in
area than he had thought he could
not see the men below and thus he
could not be seen the other five
men joined him

  they spread out till they made a
line the men below outnumbered

these more than three to one but
the odds were not so bad since these
were ready to attack and those were
not ready to defend

  slowly the six men advanced to
the edge of the shelf in a moment
they were looking down into the pan
all of the men except two were
sprawled on the ground at the foot
of the far wall those two were
moving toward the end of the draw
jerry saw that all of the men had
stopped to eat before a guard had
been placed jerry had been lucky

  jerry studied the men none had
blood-red hair

  all right jerry said softly go
ahead parks

  its your party parks said
genially go ahead yourself

  all the men raised their guns
jerry leaned a little

  stop you two he called the
rest of you dont move

  all eyes were lifted to the shelf
the two stopped shot up their
hands most of the sprawled men
reached toward the wall three rose
to sitting positions clawing awk-
wardly at their guns six bullets
sped toward them from the shelf
and they changed their minds and
followed the examples of their com-
panions

  up jerry called

  the men seemed afraid to assist
themselves with their hands they
performed the feat of coming erect
without such assistance they
backed to the wall and stood
against it

  tell the boys below to go round
an come in jerry instructed a
puncher have em take the boys
at the mouth of the draw with
them

  when that had been attended to
jerry ordered all the men below to
approach the shelf as they arrived
this side of the mouth of the draw
the barking dog



he stopped them they were a
sullen bitter lot their eyes were
bleak with anger as they stared up
at the men on the shelf

  jerry thought they were remem-
bering those decorated trees

the men who had gone round
and those who had waited at
the mouth of the draw pres-
ently came into the pan they at
once began to move along the line
of men and take their guns all but
one man were soon disarmed that
man must have been thinking par-
ticularly hard about those decorated
trees as one of parkss men
reached for his gun he turned and
seized him about the waist he was
a burly fellow in a world made up
mostly of lean men like the man he
attacked with a mighty heave he
threw the puncher over his head as
the puncher struck the ground he
threw himself on him and sought to
get his gun he seemed to believe
that if he could push that gun
against the punchers body he would
be able to threaten the other men
away from him rise with the gun
in his hand and so escape

  the hope and the act were born
of desperation like many acts so
born it failed three punchers
moved in on him one brought the
barrel of his gun smartly down on
the mans head he rolled away
from the puncher and went soundly
to sleep

  all right jerry called keep
em there till we come

  he and the live others soon joined
those below jerry wanted to know
where that red-haired man was
the man who might give that in-
formation was he who lay uncon-
scious on the ground a taste of
such medicine was bitter in a mans
mouth for a long time he would
want to escape a full dose of it

  dont none of you hombres begin
to talk about squealin an ridin
parks advised  twont do you a
bit o good i wouldnt dicker with
none of you

  you goin to hang us a man
asked

  i dunno what ill do with you
an easy way would be to put bullets
in you where you stand

  the man who had been struck
presently opened his eyes and then
pushed himself to a sitting position
he rubbed his broken scalp

  get up parks ordered

  the man rose and stood swaying
tie into him jerry parks said
wheres red blackman fella
jerry demanded

  dont know he keeps to his-
self rides alone hes a mos care-
ful man

  he was ahead of you when you
came here

  he waited for us spoke to us
for a minute then he rode off
hell go inta the first crick he
comes to

  wheres virlee

  the blankness with which these
men greeted that name generally
came to this man

  dont know no such person
he runs a saloon in town hes
your boss

  aint never been to town
wouldnt work for no town man
workin for red blackman

  where have all the stolen cows
been taken to

  dunno they was ony drove
south a ways an then turned over
to other riders

  wheres red blackmans hide-
out

  fella the man said earnestly
dont ask me that i reckon he
hides out wherever he happens
to be

  jerry ran his eyes over the other


street  smiths western story magazine

men their sullen anger had been
displaced by fear jerry was con-
vinced that if they knew anything
about the missing cows or about
blackman they would tell him he
was equally convinced that they
didnt know anything probably
blackman alone ever saw virlee-
except of course that trailer

  jerry idly glanced at the trailer
he was grinning jerrys swift
anger rose

  wipe that grin off your face
he said

  the trailer turned fully toward
him he did not wipe the grin from
his face jerry beat his anger back
the fellow had something on his
mind

  i got somethin for you the
trailer declared

  well what is it

  this here op man said it wouldnt
do nobody no good to talk about
squealin an ridin said the trailer
whats the use o my squealin if
i dont ride

  oh gosh a puncher exclaimed
do we hafta stand for this

 he seemed to decide that he
didnt have to stand for it walk-
ing up behind the trailer he placed
both hands under the trailers chin
and snapped back his head as if he
would break it from his neck the

trailer cried out the puncher re-
leased him and put his gun into
the small of his back

  speak your piece the puncher
ordered im doin this on my own
hook im sick an tired o you ill
drill you in about another minute

  smylies here the trailer whim-
pered

  which one jerry asked

  do i ride

  no the puncher cried

  let him go jerry said fella
come up here

  all of parkss men had been in a
semicircle the trailer near the end
to reach jerry the trailer had to
move between those men and the
prisoners

  when the prisoners had been dis-
armed their guns had been laid in a
pile on the ground a man near the
pile suddenly leaped and snatched
up a gun

  he sent the trailer out on the
long long trail

  some punchers seized the slayer
others covered him

  is he smylie jerry asked
generally

  yeah one of the prisoners an-
swered he killed treece

  close to red blackman is he
jerry inquired

 continued from last weeks issue

  trying to accomplish the impos-
sible is like tryin to scratch yo ear
with yo elbow barkin at a knot
like an elephant tryin to use a
typewriter or easy as trimmin
the whiskers off the man in the
moon when the cowboy believes
he has little chance of finding a
hunted object he will perhaps say
that he might as well try to find
hair on a frog or might as well
hunt for a hoss thief in heaven if
it is a contest be it a fight or a
frolic where he has small chance of
winning he is said t have as
much chance as a wax cat in hell
or about as much chance winning
as a grasshopper that hops into an
ant hill we have also heard the
expression he coudlnt get as far as
i could throw a post hole in speak-
ing of the impossibility of an escape
on the other hand something easily
accomplished is said to be as easy
as eatin striped candy

  a useless object is said to be as
useless as a  cartridge in an eight-
gauge shotgun if it is impossible
to convince another of your side of
an argument you might as well
argue with the shadow of death
and your argument has no more
effect than pourin water on a
drowned rat

  it is said of a worthless person
that he aint worth a barrel o
shucks his family tree was a
scrub or he aint fit to shoot at
when yu want to unload an clean
yo gun

  when a person grows wiser and
older in experience he is said to

have gotten more wrinkles on his
horns a sagacious person is also
said to be as wise as a tree full of
owls or a pet fox is foolish along-
side of him or he aint needin ad-
vice moren a steer needs a saddle
blanket

  on the other hand an ignorant
person dont know sic em 
couldnt drive nails in a snow
bank dont know as much about
it as a hog does a side saddle or
knowed about as much about it as
a hog does a hip pocket in a bathin
suit

  a mentally weak person is said to
be feather-headed and his condi-
tion may be expressed by any of
such terms as his thinker is
puny he didnt have nuthin un-
der his hat but hair his brain
cavity wouldnt make a drinkin cup
for a canary bird hes as shy of
brains as a terrapin is of feathers
all he knows about brains is that
yu can buy em with scrambled
eggs his memorys pulled its
picket pin an gone astray if the
one spoken of is childishly foolish
he ought to be playin with a string

  the cowboys idea of the super-
latively beautiful is pretty as a
painted wagon pretty as a heart
flush or soft an pretty as a young
calfs ear naturally in speaking
of his sweetheart she is so sweet
bee trees is gall beside her

  ugliness is not without such ex-
pressions as ugly as galvanized
sin uglier than a mexican sheep
or uglier than a new-sheared

ws-b
cowboy lingo



sheep one puncher said of an-
other that the latter was so ugly
the flies wouldnt light on him
another likewise described a cook as
being so narrow between the eyes
he could look through a keyhole
with both eyes at once

  anything large is biggern an
eight-mule baggage wagon bigger
than a load of hay or yu couldnt
crowd it into a wagon box an
extra large covering for an object
covers it like a carpet and an un-
usually large man is big enough to
hunt bears with a switch

  a fat person shore has tallow or
is so fat youd have to throw a dia-
mond hitch to keep him in the
saddle losing flesh is gettin rid
of yo leaf lard failin off like per-
simmons after a frost and if one
loses much weight he is said to be
gettin as thin as a cow in april
or as poor as a whipowill

  a very thin person is said to be
so thin yu cant hit him with a
handful of corn often weve
heard the expressions he has to
stand twice to make a shadow
hes so narrow he could take a
bath in a shotgun barrel if hed
close one eye hed look like a
needle on a texas ranch we once
heard a puncher say of a certain thin
comrade that hes so long he has
to shorten his stirrups to keep from
wearin his boot soles out of a
very short person it is said that he
has to borrow a ladder to kick a
gnat on the ankle or he drags the
ground when he walks a short ob-
ject is often expressed as being as
short as the tail hold on a bear

  we once heard a cowboy who was
feeling badly declare that he felt
like the frazzled end of a misspent
life in speaking of others who
looked or felt badly he was apt to
say he looks like a motherless
ws-b

calf hes off his feed or he looks
so bad his ears flop

  a weak person is said to be pa-
per-backed it is also said of a
puny person that he cant lick his
upper lip hes so puny he couldnt
pull off my hat or hes so weak a
kitten is robust beside him bud
cowan once told us of a lunger
visiting his ranch in search of health
and he ended his description of the
invalid by saying his lungs wasnt
stronger than a hummin birds an
he didnt have wind enough to blow
out a lamp

  in speaking of people who get
along harmoniously the cowboy is
apt to use such expressions as
they get along like two shoats in
the same pigpen they have no
more trouble than between a kitten
an a warm brick they get along
like two pups in a basket

  his idea of any objects or persons
being thick is as thick as cloves on
a christmas ham as thick as
feathers in a pillow or thick as
hossflies in may of a certain
spurred and chapped damon and
pythias they were said to be
thickern splatter

  people who are looked upon as
meddlers and horn in on things
that do not concern them are said to
be feedin off their range and are
called wedgers in paul prys or
eyeballers

  the cowboy may speak of an un-
happy person as being as sad as a
bloodhounds eye happy as a hog
bein dragged away from a feed
trough or speak of that individual
as his luck was runnin kinda
muddy or that some one or some-
thing had swiped the silver limn
off his cloud we heard a weather-
beaten cow-puncher in telling of an
incident that touched his heart say
i didnt shed no tears but i damned
near choked to death at another

time when some one told a touching
story a tender-hearted cowboy
brushing away a tear that he was
trying hard to conceal said the
smoke of yo camp fire got into my
eyes still another one in relating
a touching incident finished by say-
ing that it squeezedme together
inside till it hurt

  slowness in action is pictured as

slow as a snail climbin a slick log
or a slow person is too slow to grow
fast a man or horse that is not
up to his expectations in running is
classed as he runs like hes got

folks a couple of weeks
ago e l carson gave us
some information about
scout dick deering comes
now to the meetin here to-
night l m prill author and editor
of billings montana friend prill
is a distant relative of custer he
lectures on the custer massacre
surely he should be well up on the
subject all right then brother bill
if you will get goin you may be
sure that we will all listen atten-
tively

  boss and folks in your issue
of march   i noticed a query
from wellington stutt of saskatche-
wan canada in it he asks if scout
dick deering who served in the
boer war was not a scout with
general custer in the battle of the
little big horn

  it is very doubtful if this man
was a scout with the seventh
cavalry as indians of the crow
tribe were used entirely for this
duty these indians knew the

country well as it was their hunting
grounds and they were friendly to
the whites their trust was great in
the cavalrymen as they wanted the
hated enemy driven out of what
they asserted was their country
white scouts were not used for the
reason that this was an unknown
country and many of the soldiers
comprising the seventh cavalry
were new recruits and totally igno-
rant of indian fighting

  despite the fact that ever so
often publications come out with
stories about this or that survivor of
the so-called custer massacre one
should remember at all times there
were no survivors of this terrible
slaughter of course major reno
who retreated in the face of danger
and colonel benteen both survived
as they did not go to custers aid
many men under their command
of course were survivors of the cus-
ter expedition but not of the battle
it is therefore very evident that
many such survivors were men that
were attached to reno or benteen


street  smiths western story magazine

  no record available shows the
name of deering as being attached
to the custer forces perhaps he
had served under this distinguished
soldier but if so he must have been
serving prior to the montana cam-
paign

  mr stutt also asks a question
that should be answered as it is one
that touches on a subject little
known by the average reader
what rifles were custers troops
armed with were they the spencer
rim-fire or a more modern gun
the custer men were armed with
antique firearms they being single-
shot carbines their shells were so
poorly made that they cracked and
wedged in the breech of the carbine
after the battle the indians told how
the white men frantically hacked
away at shells that the extractors
had torn through after one shot had
been made

  the indians in this battle were
found to be armed with winchester
and remington rifles of the very
latest make they also had plenty
of ammunition for these rifles all of
which had been secured from the
post traders

  mr stutt also asks where he can
get a book on the custer battle
several books worth reading are
custers last battle by godfrey
indian fights and fighters by
brady and many interesting books
have been written by the late mrs
george armstrong custer which are
well worth reading by students of
the history of the west

  i should like very much to tell
you the story of the custer battle
in detail but what i have said would
be only the start of the entire events
that happened within only a few
minutes on the bloody sunday of

june   when george arm-
strong custer and two hundred and
sixty-five men lost their lives in des-
perate conflict with some six thou-
sand bloodthirsty sioux cheyenne
and blackfoot indians it would in
fact be too long a story for the
round-up however any who de-
sire to write me as to this battle are
welcome to do so and i will en-
deavor to correctly give information
as asked

  an extra-good serial begins in
next weeks issue kenneth perkins
is the author and he calls his story
stone stirrups now we say with
little fear of contradiction that
stone stirrups is the very best
serial that kenneth perkins has ever
written for western story magazine
this we feel about as sure of as we
can be sure of anything now for
another statement as to that story
we consider it one of the best weve
run in the magazine for a long long
time stone stirrups is in three
parts so you wont have very long to
wait before you reach the climax of
its accumulative interest and believe
us the story certainly does accumu-
late in interest until the end

by j a thompson

    this department is intended to be of real help to readers if there is
anything you want to know about mining or prospecting a letter inclosing
a stamped and self-addressed envelope sent to j a thompson care of

please keep such letters as brief as possible

           p in northern new mex-
ico theres a good gold-
mining district credited
with a six-million-dollar
production in lode and
placer that offers a mighty interest-
ing stamping ground to the present-
day prospector walter j burden
and his partner of binghamton
new york already have this par-
ticular section in mind and wal-
ter has written in for a little infor-
mation

  my partner and i are planning
a trip out west sometime soon to
take our chances gold prospecting
we have in mind the section around
elizabethtown near eagles nest
lake north and east of taos any-
thing you can tell us about the eliz-
abethtown district will be deeply
appreciated especially if you can
give us the actual names of the
more-promising smaller creeks and
stream beds in that area

  well walter youre picking a
mighty likely section of new mex-
ico to go gold hunting in

  incidentally you can reach eliza-
bethtown quite readily by car if
you enter new mexico from trini-
dad colorado via the famous
raton pass stay with the paved
highway about fifteen miles south of
raton

  then at the fifteen-mile point in-
stead of continuing on the highway
which would take you down past
wagon mound to las vegas take
the right fork a graded road marked
u s  through colfax cimarron
and ute park to therma at
therma you swing up to elizabeth-
town

  gold was first located near what
is now elizabethtown in colfax
county back in  the initial dis-
covery was followed by a stampede
of considerable proportions the


street  smiths western story magazine

earliest work was nearly all placer
then some lode deposits were
opened up notably the famous az-
tec mine

  yet in spite of the hard-rock min-
ing placering continued with good
success as a matter of fact the
total output of the region has been
pretty well divided fifty-fifty be-
tween the lode mines and the placer
operations

  the best gold gravels and hence
the best placer opportunities most
probably are to be found on mo-
reno ute and ponil creeks now
for a few more details youll find
a wide variation in the thickness of
the gold-bearing gravel beds any-
thing from a few feet up to three
hundred for the small operator
however the best bets are confined
to the narrow valleys where the
steep gradient has not permitted the
building up of thick deposits hand
methods of placer operation-sluice
box and rocker-hydraulicking and
even dredging have all been carried
on with more or less success in this
area

  lack of sufficient water for the
larger-scale operations has been a
handicap to such work so that con-
siderable potential good gold-bear-
ing gravel still remains in several
places at one time placer work
was carried on with water brought
forty-one miles from the headwaters
of the red river though the big
ditch was not kept in repair

  lately placer miners have been
using shorter ditches carrying water
derived from sources much closer to
to the gravels they are working
occasionally small reservoirs are
built which will accumulate enough
water for a few days run at a
time

  incidentally walter these gold
gravels are neither on state land

nor are they part of the public do-
main they are on territory in-
cluded in the maxwell land grant

     those interested in the maxwell
   land grant co from whom detailed
   information can be obtained concern-
   ing gold-placer gravels inclose a

and beautiful northland

dear miss rivers

  the cassiar and stikine river country
in british columbia is a gold and game
country so wild that bear goat moose
caribou and deer-may be seen from the
decks of the boats it is a district that is
renowned for the greatest variety of game
for its area in the world it is a country

of mountains canyons glaciers and
forests it is approximately one hundred
and fifty miles from wrangell alaska up
the stikine river to telegraph creek in
british columbia

  in the cassiar country gold colors are
found on almost any creek or river yes
there is gold there and plenty of it but
one must stay at least two years in that
district to develop and prospect a mine
now folks i am a sourdough with fifteen
years experience in alaska and the klon-
dike and i am looking for four men-
four straight-shooting pards from forty-five
to fifty-five years of age i am looking
for men with sense who know a wonderful
country and opportunity when they see it
to go in there with me i will show them
how to prospect or if they know how all


street  smiths western story magazine

the better i want pards who will stay
put with me in the cassiar for two years
and if they do they will get big returns

  let me hear from you hunters trap-
pers miners and prospectors but remem-
ber pards that it will take a fair-sized
grubstake to go into that country
equipped to stay for two years i estimate
that we should have a few hundred apiece

most westerners have
heard of the famous
horse heaven coun-
try of washington and
perhaps some of our
readers have wondered along with
bert t of portland oregon just
what has happened o this region

  can you tell me the fate of the
old horse heaven country mr
north is that section now given
over to farming it has always in-
terested me and im keen to know
what it is like to-day id also ap-

preciate some facts about klickitat
county which lies i believe west
of horse heaven

  when the horse heaven country
formerly one of the great grazing
regions of the evergreen state was
opened to settlement it developed
into a productive wheat-raising dis-
trict there are approximately two
hundred thousand acres in this area
that can be irrigated and when this
is done the country will become an
intensively farmed community simi-
lar to the yakima valley at pres-
where to go and how to get there



ent the farms in this section are
large and cultivation methods are
on an extensive scale

  klickitat county which bert is
correct in assuming lies west of
horse heaven boasts a number of
small valleys chief of which are the
white salmon and klickitat the
latter nearly fifty miles long and
eight miles wide includes the fer-
tile farming country around golden-
dale on a branch of the spokane
portland  seattle railway al-
falfa fruit and grain are grown in
these valleys
without irriga-
tion and con-
siderable live
stock - sheep
cattle hogs
horses - are
raised dairying
is developing and
promises to in-
crease com-
mercial apple
growing is an im-
portant industry
and peaches
apricots nuts
and vegetables do
well

  that folks do
well also in these fertile valleys of
the northwest seems to be an estab-
lished fact at any rate these
regions come in for a lot of attention
from our readers just to prove the
truth of that statement here is a
plea for information about a certain
valley of the beaver state

  im out for some facts about the
willamette valley of oregon mr
north writes whitney p of st
louis missouri and i figure you
are the man to supply them the
back-to-the-farm idea has gripped
me hard and ive been told that for
the man who wants to confine his
efforts to a few well-cultivated acres

with maximum results this region is
hard to beat now that is the pres-
ent plan of myself and the missis
but first wed like to have a sort of
brief survey of that section

  were mighty glad to oblige whit-
ney and his missis the willamette
valley lying between the coastal
range and the main range of the
cascades is one of the oldest set-
tled sections of oregon it extends
south from portland for about one
hundred and fifty miles and is from
twenty to sixty miles wide the cli-
mate is warm and
moist and the
winters are mild
with snow rarely
seen rainfall
averages about
forty-two inches
the largest per
cent of which
comes during the
winter months

  this is a region
of well-developed
farms although
there is consider-
able timberland
that still awaits
develop-
ment whitney
will find as he has been told that
the williamette valley offers splen-
did opportunities to the man who
wants to go in for general farming
on a few well-cultivated acres
fruit growing dairying poultry
raising or stock farming all offer
good returns for effort expended

  peaches pears plums apples
cherries and many other fruits are
grown extensively market vege-
tables include asparagus celery on-
ions beets rhubarb and many oth-
ers that are precooled or canned and
shipped to distant markets kale
stands green the year round and

  can you tell me how to reach the
metolius river country in the des-
chutes national forest mr north
my partner and i are planning to
spend our vacation in that part of
the west and would greatly appre-
ciate tips from you about the coun-
try its camps lakes rivers and
trails we expect to rough it and
as well be eating over a camp fire
wed like your recipes for such dishes
as beans-in-the-hole sour-dough
bread and barbecue

  troy and his partner have surely
picked a grand section for their va-

cation and we prophesy a whale of
a good time for them the meto-
lius river country is a clean open
parklike region with a growth of
western yellow pine a wealth of
fine camp grounds and many moun-
tain lakes stocked with fish it is
located fourteen miles from sisters
and forty miles from bend and may
be reached over excellent automo-
bile roads

  the metolius river which comes
forth a full-fledged stream from the
base of black butte above camp
sherman is a fishermans paradise
some of its springs are hardly five
degrees above freezing if troy and
his pal want to climb to the summit
of black butte which is a forest-fire
lookout point they may reach it
over a four-mile trail

  suttles lake another point we
would advise them to visit is four
miles from the metolius river and
is accessible by automobile here
good fishing and excellent bathing
are to be enjoyed in fact with a
store cabins tent houses and a
good camping ground this makes a
delightful place to tarry nor
should the partners fail to see blue
lake a water-filled crater of weird
beauty which lies one and a half
miles farther on and is reached by
automobile road

  a free forest camp on the national
forest along the metolius river pro-
vides delightful spots for tents and
cheerful camp fires

    recipes for sour-dough bread
  beans-in-the-hole barbecue and other
  dishes dear to the heart of the ex-
  perienced woodsman as well as addi-
  tional information and a map of the

there are four centers of
the gun-making industry
in austria innsbruck the
capital of tyrol has the
largest sporting-gun fac-
tory named for johann peterlongo
the tyrol region as most people
remember is a mountainous region
where every male is an excellent
marksman and usually a gunsmith
in addition

  ferlach a village in the carin-
thian mountains has a number of
small cottage factories where
every kind of gun can be produced
to order or duplicated from models
joseph just and martin ogris are
the leading names there

  steyr is the home of the oesterr-
waffenfabriks-ges which makes
the mannlicher-schoenauer rifles

automatic pistols and double-bar-
reled shotguns this company com-
pares very favorably with the mau-
ser plant in oberndorf germany

  vienna the capital of austria is
probably most famous for johann
springer who fills orders for great
london gun dealers like w w
greener purdey  sons and west-
ley richards springer is famous
for refusing to make a gun he doesnt
think practical for its intended pur-
pose no matter how much he is
offered

  compensators on shotguns

  f e graham wellsville ohio
when you place a compensator on
your gun you will need a high front
sight in turn you must have a high

back sight but this carries your eye
away from the stock so you must
have a butt with its comb about
one quarter inch higher than be-
fore all of this means that the
shotgun ought to be especially de-
signed if it is to be used with a com-
pensator efficiently this does not
mean that a compensator will not
improve any gun for which it is de-
signed but it does mean that one
