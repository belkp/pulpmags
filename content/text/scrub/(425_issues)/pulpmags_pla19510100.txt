   gulk i was about to pounce on you figuratively of course
 for your misleading blurbs when i happened to read them gad
 they actually describe the stories unforgiveable

   all the stories were good but carry me home was abso-
 lutely tremendous more in fact it was super ultra colossal in
 truth twas a swell tale no women cheer madly in last
 two alive foul title the virus victims were supposed to be
 neanderthal men but coppel forgot to tell us how they got to
 earth walked maybe 

   yuh know i think ps has the best letter column of any stf mag
 the writers are all slightly nuts which makes for a nice friendly
 atmosphere the letters usually give me an i-wish-i-had-said-that
 feeling it seems they just have a lot of fun and are not trying
 to solve secrets of the universe your editorial comments are
 quite witty half that is and make for good reading

   it seems to me that under your editorship ps has improved
 immensely already an issue has appeared without a bradbury
 fiasco in it why doesnt someone tell him there is next to no

middle age the strength of his warlike

cloak the only sign of kingship was the
golden chaplet on his head and the signet
ring on one finger in the gaudy crowd
of slender chattering courtiers he stood
out with a brutal contrast

planet stories

  so theyve finally captured him he
rumbled so were finally rid of corun
and his sea-going bandits maybe now the
land will have some peace

  what will you do with them sire
asked shorzon the sorcerer

  khroman shrugged heavy shoulders i
dont know pirates are usually fed to
the erinyes at the games i suppose but
corun deserves something special
public torture perhaps sire it could
be stretched over many days

  no you fool corun was the bravest
enemy achaera ever had he deserves an
honorable death and a decent tomb not
that it matters much but-

  shorzon exchanged a glance with chry-
seis then looked back toward the ap-
proaching procession

the city tauros was built
around a semicircular bay a huge
expanse of clear green water on whose
surface floated ships from halfway round
the world-the greatest harbor for none
knew how many empty sea-leagues capital
of achaera which with its trade and its
empire of entire archipelagoes was the
mightiest of the thalassocracies beyond
the fortified sea walls at the end of the bay
the ocean swelled mightily to the clouded
horizon gray and green and amber with-
in the hulls and sails of ships were a
bright confusion up to the stone docks

  the land ran upward from the bay
and tauros was built on the hills a tangle
of streets between houses that ranged
from the clay huts of the poor to the
marble villas of the great beyond the
city walls on the landward side the island
of achaera lifted still more steeply a
gaunt rocky country with a few scattered
farms and herds her power came all from
the sea

  a broad straight road lined with sphinx-
es ran straight from the harbor up to
the palace which stood on the highest hill
in the city at its end wide marble stairs
lifted toward the fragrant imperial gardens
in which the court stood

  folk swarmed about the street mobs
straining to see the soldiers as they led
their captives toward the palace the word
that corun of conahur the most danger-

ous of the pirates had finally been taken
had driven merchants to ecstasy and
brought insurance rates tumbling down
there was laughter in the throng jeers
for the prisoners shouts for the king

    not entirely so however most of the
  crowd were of course achaerans a slim
  dark-haired folk clad generally in a light
  tunic and sandals proud of their ancient
  might and culture they were loudest in
  shouting at the robbers but there were
  others who stood silent and glum-faced
  not daring to voice their thoughts but mak-
  ing them plain enough tall fair men
  from conahur itself galled by achaeran
  rule fur-clad barbarians from norriki
  blue-skinned savages from umlotu with a
  high professional regard for their fellow
  pirate slaves from a hundred islands who
  had not ceased dreaming of home and re-
  membered that corun had been in the
  habit of freeing slaves when he captured a
  ship or a town others might be neutral
  coming from too far away to care for corun
  had only attacked achaeran galleys the
  black men from misty orzaban the cop-
  per-colored chilatzis the yellow wizards
  from mysterious hiung-nu

    the soldiers marched their prisoners
  rapidly up the street they were mercen-
  aries blue umlotuans in the shining cor-
  selets greaves and helmets of the achae-
  ran forces armed with the short sword
  and square shield of achaera as well as
  the long halberds which were their special
  weapon when the mob came too close
  they swung the butts out with bone-snap-
  ping force

    the captive pirates were mostly from
  conahur though there were a number of
  other lands represented they stumbled
  wearily along clad in a few rags weighted
  down hand and foot by their chains only
  one of them the man in the lead walked
  erect but he strode along with the arro-
  gance of a conqueror

    that must be corun himself there in
  the front of them said chryseis

    it is nodded shorzon

 they moved forward for a
better look imperceptibly the court
shrank from them khromans advisor
ykughter were feared in tauros
witch of the demon seas



  shorzon was tall and lean and dry as
if the heaven-fire beyond the eternal
clouds had fallen on him and seared all
moisture out of the gaunt body he had
the noble features of the old achaeran
aristocracy but his eyes were dark and
sunken and smoldering with strange fires
even in the warmth of midday he wore
a black robe falling to his feet and his
white beard streamed over it folk knew
that he had learned sorcery in hiung-nu
and it was whispered that for all khro-
mans brawling strength it was shorzon
who really dominated the realm

  khroman had married shorzons daugh-
ter-none knew who her mother had been
though it was thought she was a witch
from hiung-nu she had not lived long
after giving birth to chryseis whose
grandfather thus came to have much of
her upbringing in his hands rumor had
it that she was as much a witch as he a
warlock

  certainly she could be cruel and ungov-
ernable but she had a strange dark beauty
over her that haunted men there were
more who would die for her than one
could readily count    and it was said
had died after a night or two

  she was tall and lithe with night-black
hair that streamed to her waist when un-
bound her eyes were huge and dark in
a face of coldly chiseled loveliness and
the full red mouth denied the austere god-
dess-like fineness of her countenance to-
day she had not affected the heavy gold
and jewels of the court a white robe
hung in dazzling folds about her-and
there might as well not have been another
woman present

  the prisoners came through the palace
gates which clashed shut behind them
up the stairs they went and into the fra-
grance of green trees and bushes bloom-
ing plants and leaping fountains that was
the garden there they halted and the
court buzzed about them like flies around
a dead animal

  khroman stepped up to corun greet-
ing he said and there was no mockery
in his voice

  greeting replied the pirate in the
same even tones

  they measured each other the

two strong men who understood what they
were about corun was as big as khro-
man a fair-skinned giant of a man in
chains and rags weather-bleached yellow
hair hung to his shoulders from a haugh-
tily lifted head knd his fire-blue eyes
were unwavering on the kings his face
was lean long-jawed curve-nosed hard-
ened by bitterness and suffering and des-
perate unending battle a chained erinye
could not have looked more fiercely on
his captors

  its taken a long time to catch you
corun said khroman youve led us a
merry chase once i almost had the plea-
sure of meeting you myself it was when
you raided serapolis-remember i hap-
pened to be there and gave chase in one
of the war-galleys but we never did
catch you

  one of the ships did coruns voice
was strangely soft for so big a man it
didnt come back as you may recall

  how did they finally catch you  asked
khroman

orun shrugged and the chains
about his wrists rattled you al-
ready know as much as i care to talk
about he said wearily we sailed into
iliontis bay and found a whole fleet wait-
ing for us someone must finally have
spied out our stronghold khroman nod-
ded and corun shrugged a shoulder
they blocked off our retreat so we just
fought till everyone was dead or cap-
tured these half-hundred men are all who
live unfortunately i was knocked out
during the battle and woke up to find my-
self a prisoner otherwise- his blue gaze
raked the court with a lashing contempt-
i could be peacefully feeding fish now
instead of your witless fish-eyes

  i wont drag out the business for you
corun said khroman your men will
have to be given to the games of course
but you can be decently and privately be-
headed

  thanks said the pirate but ill stay
with my men

khroman stared at him in puzzlement
but why did you ever do it he asked
finally with your strength and skill and
ook -rcunning you could have gone far in


planet stories

achaera we take mercenaries from con-
quered provinces you know you could
have gotten achaeran citizenship in time
i was a prince of conahur
said corun slowly i saw my
land invaded and my folk taken off as
slaves i saw my brothers hacked down
at the battle of lyrr my sister taken as
concubine by your admiral my father
hanged my mother burned alive when
they fired the old castle they offered me
amnesty because i was young and they
wanted a figurehead so i swore an oath
of fealty to achaera and broke it the first
chance i got it was the only oath i ever
broke and still i am proud of it i sailed
with pirates until i was big enough to
master my own ships that is enough of
an answer

  it may be said khroman slowly you
realize of course that the conquest of
conahur took place before i came to the
throne and that i certainly couldnt ne-
gate it in view of the thalassocrats duty
to his own country and had to punish its
incessant rebelliousness 

  i dont hold anything against you your-
self khroman said corun with a tired
smile but id give my soul to the nether
fires for the chance to pull your damned
palace down around your ears

  im sorry it has to end this way
said the king you were a brave man
id like to drain many beakers of wine
with you on the other side of death
he signed to the guards take him
away

  one moment sire said shorzon is
it your intention to lock all these pirates
in the same dungeon cell 

  why-i suppose so why not

  i do not trust their captain chained
and imprisoned he is still a menace i
think he has certain magical techniques-
thats a lie spat corun i never
needed your stinking womans tricks to
flatten the likes of achaera

  i would not leave him with his men
advised shorzon imperturbably best he
be given his own cell alone i know a
place

  well-well let it be so khroman
waved a hand in dismissal

  as shorzon turned to lead the guard

off he traded a long glance with chryseis
her eyes remained hooded as she looked
after the departing captives

ii

the cell was no longer

than a mans height a dripping cave
hewed out of the rock under the palace
foundations corun crouched on the stream-
ing floor in utter darkness the chains
which they had locked to ringbolts in the
wall clashed when he stirred

  and this was how it ended he thought
bitterly the wild career of the exiled
conqueror the heave and surge of ships
under the running waves the laughter of
comrades and the clamor of swords and
the thrum of wind in the rigging had
come to this-one man hunched in a lone-
liness and darkness like a colder womb
waiting in timeless murk for the day when
they would drag him out to be torn by
beasts for the amusement of fools

  they fed him at intervals a slave bring-
ing a bowl of prison swill while a spear-
armed guard stood well out of reach and
watched otherwise he was alone he
could not even hear the voices of other
captives there was only the slow dripping
of water and the harsh tones of iron links
the cell must lie below even the regular
dungeons far down in the very bowels of
the island

  vague images floated across his mind-
the high cliffs about iliontis bay the
great flowers blooming with sullen fires
in the jungle beyond the beach the slim
black corsair galleys at anchor he re-
membered the open sky the eternally
clouded sky under which blew the long
wet winds out of which spilled rain and
lightning and grew the eerie blue of dusk
he had often wondered what lay beyond
those upper clouds

  now and then he remembered one
could see the vague disc of the heaven-
fire and he had heard of times when
incredibly violent storms opened a brief
rift in the high cloud layers to let through
a shaft of searing brilliance at whose touch
water boiled and the earth burst into
flame it made him think of the specula-
tions f conahurs philosophers that the
witch of the demon seas



world was really a globe around which
the heaven-fire swung bringing day and
night some had gone so far as to imagine
that it was the world which did the mov-
ing that the heaven-fire was a ball of
flame in the middle of creation about
which all other things revolved

  but conahur was in chains now he re-
membered its folk bowed to the will of
achaeras greedy proconsuls its art and
philosophy the idle playthings of the con-
querors the younger generation was
growing up with an idea that it might be
best to yield to become absorbed into
the thalassocracy and so eventually gain
equal status with the achaerans

  but corun could not forget the great
flames flapping against a wind-torn night
sky the struggling forms at ropes ends
swaying from trees the long lines of
chained people stumbling hopelessly to the
slave galleys under achaeran lashes per-
haps he had carried the grudge too long
-no by breannach brannor there had
been a family which was no longer that
was grudge enough for a lifetime

  a lifetime he thought sardonically
which wouldnt be very much protracted
now

he sighed wearily in the
stinking gloom of the cell there
were too many memories crowding in the
outlaw years had been hard and desperate
but theyd been good ones too there had
been song and laughter and comradeship
and gigantic deeds over an endless waste
of waters-the long blue hush of twilight
the soft black nights the gray days with
a sea running gray and green and gold
under squalls of rain the storms roaring
and raging the eager leap of a ship-
frenzy of battle at the taking of town
or galley death so close one could almost hear
the beat of black wings orgy of loot and
vengeance-the pirate town grass huts
under jungle trees stuffed with treasure
full of brawling bawdy life the scar-faced
swaggering men and the lusty insolent wo-
men ruddy fire-light hammering back the
night while the stfrf thundered endlessly
along the beach-

  well all things came to a close and
while he would have wished a differ

sort of death for himself he didnt have
long to wait in this misery

  something stirred far down the nar-
row corridor and he caught the flickering
glow of a torch scowling he stood up
stooped under the low ceiling who in
all the hells was this it was too soon
for feeding unless his time sense had gone
completely awry and he didnt think the
games could have been prepared in the
few days since his arrival

  they came up to the entrance of the
cell and stood looking in by the guttering
red torchlight a snarl twisted coruns
lips shorzon and chryseis--of all the
scum of achaera he growled i had to
be inflicted with you

  this is no time for insolence said
the sorcerer coldly he lifted the torch
higher the red light threw his face into
blood-splashed shadow his eyes were pits
of darkness in which smoldered two em-
bers his black robe blended with the
surrounding shadow his face and hands
seemed to float disembodied in the dank
air

  coruns eyes traveled to chryseis and
in spite of the hate that burned in him he
had to admit she was perhaps the loveliest
woman he had ever seen tall and slim and
lithe moving with the soundless grace of
a sanduvian pherax the dark hair sheen-
ing down past the chill sculptured beauty
of her marble-white face she returned his
blue stare with eyes of dark flame she
was dressed as if for action-a brief tunic
that left arms and legs bare a short black
cloak and high buskins-but jewels still
blazed at throat and wrists

  behind her padded a lean shadow at
sight of which corun stiffened he had
heard of chryseis tame erinye folk said
the devil-beast had found a harder heart
in the witchs breast and yielded to her
some said less mentionable things

  the slitted green eyes flared at corun
and the cruel muzzle opened in a fanged
yawn back perias said chryseis evenly

  her voice was low and sweet almost a
caress it seemed strange that such a voice
had spoken the rituals of black sorcery
and ordered the flaying alive of a thousand
helpless issarian prisoners and counseled
some of the darkest intrigues in achaeras


planet stories

bloody history

  she said to corun this is a fine end
for all your noble thoughts man of con-
ahur

  at least he answered you credit me
with having had them which is more
than id say for you

the red lips curved in a cynical
smile human purposes have a habit
of ending this way the mighty warrior
the scourge of the seas ends in a foul
prison cell waiting for an unimaginative
death the old epics lied didnt they
life isnt quite the glorious adventure
that fools think it to be

  it could be if it werent for your
sort wearily go away wont you
if you wont even let me talk with my
old comrades you can at least spare me
your own company

  we are here with a definite purpose
said shorzon we offer you life free-
dom-and the liberation of conahur
he shook his tawny head it isnt even
funny

  no no i mean it said chryseis ear-
nestly shorzon had you put in here alone
not out of malice but simply to make this
private talk possible you can help us
with a project so immeasurably greater
than your petty quarrels that anything
you can ask in return will be as nothing
and you are the one man who can do so

  i tell you this so that realizing you
have some kind of bargaining position you
will meet as us as equal to equal not as
prisoner to captor if you agree to aid us
you will be released this instant

  with a sudden flame within him corun
tautened his huge body o gods-o al-
mighty gods beyond the clouds-if it were
true-

  his voice shook what do you want 
your help in a desperate venture
said chryseis i tell you frankly that we
may well all die in it but at least you
will die as a free man-and if we suc-
ceed all the world may be ours

  what is it he asked hoarsely

  i cannot tell you everything now
said shorzon but the story has long
been current that you once sailed to the
lairs of the xanthi the sea demons and

returned alive is it true

  aye corun stiffened with sudden
alarm trembling in his nerves aye by
great good luck i came back but they
are not a race for humans to traffic with
i think the powers i can summon will
match theirs said shorzon we want
you to guide us to their dwellings and
teach us the language on the way as well
as whatever else you know about them
when we return you may go where you
choose and if we get their help we will
be able to set conahur free soon after-
ward

  corun shook his head its nothing
good that you plan he said slowly no
one would approach the xanthi for any
good purpose

  you did didnt you chuckled the
wizard dryly if you want the truth we
are after their help in seizing the govern-
ment of achaera as well as certain knowl-
edge they have

  if you succeeded argued corun stub-
bornly why should you then let cona-
hur go

  because power over achaera is only a
step to something too far beyond the petty
goals of empire for you to imagine said
shorzon bleakly you must decide now
man if you refuse you die

  chryseis moved one slim hand and the
erinye padded forward on razor-clawed
feet the leathery wings were folded back
against the long black body the barbed
tail lashed hungrily and a snarl vibrated
in the lean throat if you say no came
the womans sweet voice perias will rip
your guts out that will at least afford us
an amusing spectacle for our trouble
then she smiled the dazzling smile which
had driven men to their doom ere this
but if you say yes she whispered a
destiny waits for you that kings would
envy you are a strong man corun i
like strong men-

  the corsair looked into the warm dark
light of her eyes and back to the icy
glare of the devil-beast no unarmed man
had ever survived the onslaught of an erin-
ye-and he was chained

at thought of returning to the dark
home of the xanthi he shuddered but
still wondrous sweet and-once
witch of the demon seas



free to move about he might still have
some chance of escape or even of over-
powering them

  or-who knew he wondered with a
brief giddiness if the dark witch before
him could be as evil as her enemies said
strong and ruthless yes-but so was he
when he learned the full truth about
her soaring plans he might even decide
they were right

  in any case-to live to die if he
must under the sky

  ill go he said hoarsely ill go with
you

  the low exultant laughter of chryseis
sang in the flare-lit gloom

  shorzon came up and took a key from
his belt for a bare moment the thought of
snapping that skinny neck raged through
coruns mind

  the magician smiled grimly dont try
it he said as a small proof of what
we can do-

  suddenly he was not there it was a
monster from the jungles of umlotu stand-
ing in the cell with corun a scaled beast
that hissed at him with grinning jaws
and spewed poison on the floor

sorcery corun shrank back a chill
of fear striking even his steely heart
shorzon resumed human shape and word-
lessly unlocked the chains they fell away
and corun stumbled out into the corridor

  the erinye snarled and slipped closer
chryseis laid a hand on the beasts head
checking that gliding rush as if with a
leash her smile and the faint sweet scent
of her hair were dizzying

  come she said one hand slipped be-
tween his own fingers and the cool touch
seemed to burn him

  shorzon led the way down a long slop-
ing tunnel where only the streaming torch-
flames had life their footsteps echoed
hollowly in the wet black length of it

  we go at once he said when khro-
man learns of your escape all tauros will
be after us but it will be too late then
we sail swiftly tonight

  sail-whither 

  what of my men asked corun

  theyre lost im afraid unless khro-
man spares them until we get backys

 chryseis but we saved you im glad
 of that

   a faint smell of fresh salty air blew up
 the tunnel it must open on the sea
 thought corun he wondered how many
 passages riddled the depth under tauros

   they came out finally on a narrow
 beach under the looming western cliffs
 the precipices climbed into the utter dark
 of night reaching into the unseen sky
 before them lay open sea swirling with
 phosphorescence corun drew deep lung-
 fulls of air salt and seaweed and wet
 wild wind-sand under his feet sky over-
 head a woman beside him-by the gods
 it was good to be alive

   a galley was moored against a tiny
 pier by the light of bobbing torches
 coruns mariners eye surveyed her she
 was built along the same lines as his own
 ship a lean black vessel with one square
 sail open-decked save at stem and stern
 rowers benches lining the sides with a
 catwalk running between there would
 be quarters for the men under the- poop
 and forecastle decks supplies in the hold
 beneath a cabin was erected near the
 waist apparently for officers and there

 was a ballista mounted in the bows--

 otherwise no superstructure a carved sea
 monster reared up for figurehead and the
 sternpost curved back to make its tail he
 read the name on the bows briseia
 strange that that dark vessel should bear
 a girls name

   about a fifty-man capacity he judged
 and she would be fast

   the crew were getting aboard-they
 must have come down the cliffs along
 some narrow trail they were all umlo-
 tuan blues he noticed a cutthroat gang
 if ever he saw one but silent and well
 disciplined it was shrewd to take only
 the mercenary warriors along they had
 no patriotic interest in what happened to
 achaera and their reckless courage was
 legendary

   a burly one-eyed officer came up and
 saluted all set sir he reported

   good nodded shorzon captain im- 
 azu this is our guide captain corun

   the raider eh imazu chuckled and
 jshook hands in the manner of the bar-
 barians well we could hardly have a


pjlajvet stories

better one im sure glad to know you
corun

  the pirate murmured polite phrases
but he decided that imazu was a likeable
chap and wondered what had led him to
take service under anyone with shor-
zons reputation

  they went aboard the sea of demons
lies due north said shorzon is that
the right way to sail

  for the time being nodded corun
when we get closer ill be able to tell
you more exactly

  then you may as well wash and rest
said chryseis you need both her smile
was soft in the flickering red light

  corun entered the cabin it was divided
into three compartments-apparently ima-
zu slept with his men or perhaps on deck
as many men preferred his own tiny
room was clean sparsely furnished with
a bunk and a washbowl he cleaned him-
self eagerly and put on the fresh tunic
laid out for him

  when he came back on deck the ship
was already under way a strong south
wind was blowing filling the dark sail
and the briseia surged forward under its
thrust the phosphorescence shone around
her hull and out on the rolling waters
behind the land faded into the night

  hed certainly been given no chance to
escape he thought barring miracles he
had to go through with it now-at least
until they reached the sea of demons
after which anything might happen

  he shivered a little wondering darkly
whether he had done right wondering
what their mission was and what the
worlds fate was to be as a result of it

  chryseis slipped quietly up to stand be-
side him the erinye crouched down near-
by his baleful eyes never leaving the
man

  outward bound she said and laugh-
ter was gay in her voice

  he said nothing but stared ahead into
the night

  youd better sleep corun she said
youre tired now and youll need all
your strength later she laid a hand on
his arm and laughed aloud it will be
an interesting voyage to say the least

  rather he thought with wry humors

it occurred to him that the trip might
even have its pleasant aspects

  goodnight corun she said and left
him

  presently he went back to his room
sleep was long in coming and uneasy
when it did arrive

ill

when he came out on deck
in the early morning there was
only a gray emptiness of waters out to
the gray horizon they must have left
the whole achaeran archipelago well be-
hind them and be somewhere in the zurian
sea now

  there was a smell of rain in the air
and the ship ran swiftly before a keening
wind over long white-maned rollers cor-
un let the tang of salt and moisture and
kelp the huge restless vista of bounding
waves the creak and thrum of the ship
and the thundering surge of the ocean
swell luxuriously up within him the sim-
ple animal joy of being at home the sea
was his home now he realized vaguely
he had been on it so long that it was
his natural environment-his as much as
that of the laridae wheeling on white
wings in the cloud-flying heavens

  he looked over the watch it seemed
to be well handled-the sailors knew their
business there were armored guards at
bow and stern and the rest-clad in the
plain loincloth of ordinary seamen the
world over-were standing by the sail
swabbing the decks making minor repairs
and otherwise occupying themselves those
off duty were lounging or sleeping well out
of the watchs way the helmsman kept
his eye on the compass and held the tiller
with a practiced hand-good good

 captain imazu padded up to him on
bare feet the umlotuan wore helmet
and corselet had a sword at his side and
carried the whip of authority in one
gnarled blue hand his scarred one-eyed
face cracked in a smile good morning
to you captain corun he said politely

  the conahurian nodded with an amia-
bility he had not felt for a long time
the ship is well handled he said

thanks im about the only umlotuan
witch of the demon seas



whos ever skippered anything bigger than
a war-canoe i suppose but i was in the
achaeran fleet for a long time again
the hideous but disarming smile i nearly
met you professionally once or twice be-
fore but you always showed us a clean
pair of l heels judging from what hap-
pened to ships that did have the misfor-
tune to overhaul you im just as glad of
it he gestured to the tiny galley below
the poop deck how about some break-
fast

over food which was better than
most to be had aboard ship they
fell into professional talk like all cap-
tains imazu was profoundly interested in
the old and seemingly insoluble problem
of finding an accurate position dead
reckoning just wont do he complained
mens estimates always differ no matter
how good they may be there isnt even
a decent map to be had anywhere

  corun mentioned the efforts of theo-
rists in achaera conahur and other civ-
ilized states to use the heaven-fires alti-
tude to determine position north and south
of a given line imazu was aware of their
work but regarded it as of little practical
value you just dont see it often enough
he objected and most of the crew would
consider it the worst sort of impiety to go
aiming an instrument at it thats one
reason i suppose why shorzon shipped
only umlotuans we dont worship the
heaven-fire-our gods all live below the
clouds he cut himself a huge quid of
liangzi and stuffed it into his capacious
mouth anyway it doesnt give you east
and west position

   the philosophers who think the world
is round say we could solve that problem
by making an accurate timepiece said
corun

   i know but its a lot of gas if you
ask me a sand-glass or a water-clock can
only tell time so close and no closer and
those mechanical gadgets theyve built are
worse yet i knew an old skipper from
norriki once who kept a joss in his cabin
and got his position in dreams from it
only had one wreck in his life imazu
grinned of course he drowned then

  look said corun suddenly do yp

know where the hell were going and
why 

  to the sea of demons is all they told
me no reason given imazu studied
corun with his sharp black eye you
dont know either eh ive a notion that
most of us wont live to find out

  im surprised that any crew could be
made to go there without a mutiny
this gang of bully boys is only fright-
ened of shorzon and his witch grand-
daughter they- imazu shut up look-
ing around corun saw the two approach-
ing

  in the morning light chryseis did not
seem the luring devil-woman of the night
she moved with easy grace across the
rolling deck the wind blowing her tunic
and her long black hair in careless billows
and there was a girlish joy and eagerness
in her the pirates heart stumbled and
began to race

  she chattered gaily of nothing while
she and the old man ate shorzon re-
mained silent until he was through then
said curtly to the two men come into
the cabin with us

  they filled coruns tiny room sitting
on bunk and floor shorzon said slowly
we may as well begin now to learn
what you know corun what is the truth
about your voyage to the xanthi

  it was several seasons ago replied
the corsair i got the thought you seem
to have had that possibly i could enlist
their help against my enemies he smiled
mirthlessly i learned better

  what do we know of them exactly
said shorzon methodically he ticked the
points off on his lean fingers they are
an amphibious non-human race dwelling
in the sea of demons which is said to
grow grass so that ships become tangled
there and never escape

  not so said corun theres kelp
on the surface but you can sail right
through it i think the sea is just a dead
region of water around which the great
ocean currents move

  i know said shorzon impatiently
and resumed his summary generations
ago the xanthi of whose presence men
had only been vaguely aware before fell
upon all the islands in their sea and slew
	planet

the people living there they had great
numbers as well as tamed sea monsters
and unknown powers of sorcery so that
no one could stand against them since
then they have not gone beyond their
borders but they ruthlessly destroy all
human vessels venturing inside king phi-
dion iii of achaera sent a great fleet to
drive the xanthi from their stolen terri-
tory not one ship returned men now
shun the whole region as one accursed
imazu nodded theres a sailors le-
gend that the souls of the damned go to
the xanthi he offered

  shorzon gave him an exasperated look
im only interested in facts he said
coldly what do you know corun 

  i know what you just said as who
doesnt answered the conahurian but
i think they must have limits to their
powers and be reasonable creatures-but
the limits are far beyond mans and
their reason is not as ours

  i didnt try an invasion of course i
took one small fast boat manned with
picked volunteers and waited outside the
sea for a storm that would blow me into
it when that came we ran before it-
fast in the rain and wind and waves i
figured we could get undetected far into
their borders so it seemed we could
and in fact we made it almost to the largest
island inside then they came at us

  they were riding cetaraea and driving
sea serpents before them they had spears
and bows and swords and there were
hundreds of them any one of the snakes
could have smashed our boat we ran for
land and barely made it

  we hadnt come to fight so we held up
our hands as the xanthi leaped ashore
and wondered if theyd just hack us down
but as id hoped they wanted to know
what we were there for so they took us
to the black castle on the island

momentarily corun was cold as

the memory of that wet dark place
of evil shuddered through his mind i
cant tell you much about it they have
great powers of sorcery and the place
seemed somehow unreal never the same
-always wrong always with something
horrible just beyond vision in the shadows

stories

i remember the whole time as if it were
a dream there were treasures beyond
counting i saw gold and jewels from the
sea bottom mixed in with human skulls
and the figureheads of drowned ships
the light was dim and blue and there
was always fog and noises for which
we had no name hooting out in the gloom
it stank with the vile fishy smell they
have and the walls seemed to have a
watery unreality as i said shifting and
fading like smoke you could smell sor-
cery in the very air of that place

  they kept us there for many ten-
days wed brought rich gifts of course
which they accepted ungraciously and
they housed us in a dungeon under guard
they didnt feed us so badly if you like
a steady fish diet and they taught us
their language

  how does it sound as chryseis

  i cant make it come out right no
human throat can something like this-
they stiffened at the chill hissing that
slithered from corums lips it has words
for things i never did understand and it
lacks many of the commonest human
words-fear joy hope adventure- his
glance slid to chryseis-love-

  do they have a word for hate  asked
shorzon

  oh yes corun grinned without hu-
mor after a moment he went on they
wanted to know more of the outside world
that was why they spared our lives when
we knew the language well enough they
began to question us how they ques-
tioned us it got to be torture those un-
ending days of answering the things that
hissed and gabbled at us in those shadowy
rooms it was like a nightmare where
mad happenings go on without ever end-
ing politics science philosophy art geo-
graphy-they wanted to know it all they
pumped us dry of knowledge when we
came to something they didnt understand
such as-love say-they went back and
forth over the same ground over and
over again until we thought wed go crazy

   and at last theyd give up in bafflement
i think they believe humans to be mad

  i made my offer of course the loot
of achaera in exchange for the freedom
gf conahur they-i might almost say
witch of the demon seas



they laughed finally they answered in
scorn that they could take whatever they
wanted the whole world if need be with-
out my help

   shorzons eyes glittered did you find
out anything of their powers he asked
eagerly

  a little they put any human magi-
cian to shame of course i saw them
charm sea monsters to death jut to eat
them i saw them working on a new build-
ing on the island-they planted a little
package somewhere and set fire to it and
great stones leaped into the air with a
bang like thunder i saw their cetaraea
cavalry their tamed war-snakes-oh yes
they have more powers than i could name
and their numbers must be immense they
live on the sea bottom you know-that
is their commoners do the leaders have
strongholds on land as well they farm
both sea and land and have great smithies
on the islands

   well in the end they let us go they
were going to put us to death for our
trespass i think but i did some fast
talking i told them that we could carry
word of their strength back to humans
and overawe our race with it so that if
they ever wanted to collect tribute or
something of the sort theyd never have
to fight for it probably that carried less
weight than the fact that we had after all
done no harm and been of some use they
had no logical reason to kill us-so they
didnt corun smiled grimly we were
a pretty tough crew prepared to take a
few xanthi to death with us even if we
were disarmed their killing-charms seem
to work only on animals that was another
reason to spare us

   one of their wizards was for having me
at least slain he said hed had a pre-
vision of my return with ruin in my wake
but the others-laughed-at him at the
very thought of a humans being dangerous
to them moreover they pointed out if
that was to be the case then there was
nothing they could do about it they
seem to believe in a fixed destiny but
the idea amused them so much that it was
still another reason for letting us go
corun shrugged so we sailed away
thats all and never till now did i have

any smallest thought of returning

   he added bleakly after a moment when
silence had been heavy they have all
they want to know from my visit there
will be no reason for them to spare us
this time

i think there will said chryseis
thered better be muttered imazu
you can start teaching us their lan-
guage said shorzon it might not be a
bad idea for you to learn too imazu the
more who can talk to them the better
the umlotuan made a wry face an-
other tongue to learn by the topknot of
mwanzi why cant the world settle on
one and end this babble

   the poor interpreters would starve to
death smiled chryseis

   she took coruns arm come my buc-
caneer lets go up on deck for a while
theres always time to learn words

they found a quiet spot on the
forecastle deck and sat down against
the rail the erinye settled his long body
beside chryseis and watched corun with
sleepy malevolence but he was hardly
aware of the devil-beast it was chryseis
chryseis dark sweet hair and dark lam-
bent eyes utter loveliness of face and
form singing golden voice and light warm
touch and-

  you are a strange man corun she
said softly what are you thinking now
oh-nothing he smiled crookedly
nothing 

   i dont believe that you have too many
memories	

  almost without knowing it he found
himself telling her of his life the long
terrible struggle against overwhelming
power the bitterness and loneliness the
death of comrades one by one-and the
laughter and triumphs and wild exultance
of it the faring into unknown seas and
the dicing with fate and the strong close
bonds of men against the world he mused
wistfully about a girl who was gone-but
her bright image was strangely fading in
his heart now for it was chryseis who
was beside him 

   it has been a hard life she said at
the end it took a giant of a man to
pndure it she smiled a small closed smile


planet stories

that made her look strangely young i
wonder what you must think of this-
sailing with your sworn foes to the end
 of the world on an unknown mission
youre not my foe he blurted

  no-never your enemy corun she
exclaimed we have been on opposite
sides before-let it not be thus from this
moment i tell you that the purpose of
this voyage which you shall soon know
is-good great and good as the savagery
of man has never known before you
 know the old legend-that someday the
heaven-fire will shine through opening
clouds not as a destroying flame but as
the giver of life-that men will see light
in the sky even at night-that there will
be peace and justice for all mankind i
think that day may be dawning corun
he sat dumbly bewildered she was
not evil-she was not evil-it was all he
knew but it sang within him

  suddenly she laughed and sprang to
her feet come on she cried ill race
you around the ship

iv

rain and wind came a

lightning-shot squall in which the
briseia wallowed and bucked and men
strained at oars and pumps toward even-
ing it was over the sea stilled and the
lower clouds faded so that they saw the
great dull-red disc of the heaven-fire
through the upper clouds sinking into the
western sea there was almost a flat calm
the glassy water was ruffled only by a
faint breeze which half filled the sail and
sent the galley sliding slowly and noise-
lessly northward

   man the oars directed shorzon

  give the men a chance to rest to-
night sir begged imazu theyve all
worked hard today we can row all the
faster tomorrow if we must

   no time to spare snapped the wizard
 yes there is said corun flatly let
 the men rest imazu

  shorzon gave him a baleful glance
you forget your position aboard

   corun bristled i think im just be-
ginning to remember it he answered with
metal in his voice

  chryseis laid a hand on her grand-
fathers arm hes right she said so
is imazu it would be needless cruelty to
make the sailors work tonight and they
will be better fitted by a nights rest

  very well said shorzon sullenly he
went into his room and slammed the door
presently chryseis bade the men good-
night and went to her quarters with the
erinye trotting after

  coruns eyes followed her through the
deepening blue dusk in that mystic light
the ship was a shadowy half-real back-
ground a dimness beyond which the sea
swirled in streamers of cold white ra-
diance

  shes a-strange woman said imazu
i dont understand her

  nor i admitted corun but i know
now her enemies have foully lied about
her

  im not so sure about that- as the
conahurian turned with a dark frown
imazu added quickly oh well im prob-
ably wrong i never had much sight of
her you know

  they wandered up on the poop deck
in search of a place to sit it was deserted
save for the helmsman by the dimly glow-
ing binnacle a deeper shadow in the
thick blue twilight sitting back against
the taffrail they could look forward to
the lean waist of the ship and the vague
outline of the listlessly bellying sail be-
yond the hull the sea was an arabesque
of luminescence delicate traceries of shift-
ing white light out to the glowing horizon
the cold fire streamed from the ships
bows and whirled in her wake the hull
dripped liquid flame

  the night was very quiet the faint hiss
and smack of cloven water creak o
planks and tackle distant splashing of
waves and invisible sea beasts-otherwise
there was only the enormous silence under
the high clouds the breeze was cool on
their cheeks

  how long till we get to the sea of
demons asked imazu his voice was
oddly hushed in the huge stillness

  with ordinary sailing weather id say
about three ten-days-maybe four an-
swered corun indifferenlly

a strange mission were on aye
witch of the demon seas



that it is imazus head wagged barely
visible in the dark i like it not corun
i have evil feelings about it and the
omens i took before leaving werent good
why then did you sail youre a free
man arent you

  so they say sudden bitterness rose
in the umlotuans voice free as any of
shorzons followers which is to say less
free than a slave who can at least run
away

  why doesnt he pay well

  oh aye he is lavish in that regard
but he has his ways of binding servants
to him so that they must do his bidding
above that of the very gods he put
his geas on most of these sailors for in-
stance they were simple folk and thought
he was only magicking them a good-luck
charm

  you mean they are bound he has
their souls

 aye he put them to sleep in some
sorcerous way and impressed his command
on them no matter what happens now
they must obey him the geas is stronger
than their own wills

  corun shivered are you-pardon its
no concern of mine

  no no thats all right he put no
such binding on me-i knew better than
to accept his offer of a luck-bringing spell
but he has other ways he lent me a slave-
girl from umlotu for my pleasure-but
she is lovely wonderful kind all-that a
woman should be she has borne me sons
and made homecoming ever a joy but you
see she is still shorzons and he will not
sell her to me or free her-moreover he
did put his geas on her if ever i rebelled
she would suffer for it imazu spat over
the rail so i am shorzons creature too
it must be a strange service

   it is mostly all i have to do is captain
his bodyguard but ive seen and helped
in some dark things hes a fiend from
the lowest hell shorzon is and his
granddaughter- imazu stopped

  yes asked corun roughly his hand
closed bruisingly on the others arm go
on what of her

  nothing nothing i really have had
little to do with her imazus face was

-planet-january

lost in the gloom but corun felt the one
eye hard on him only-be careful pi-
rate dont let her lay her own sort of
geas on you youve been a free man
till now dont become anyones blind
slave

  ive no such intention said corun
frostily

  then no more need be said imazu
sighed heavily and got up i think ill
go to bed then what of you

  not yet im not sleepy goodnight

  goodnight

corun sat back alone he could
barely discern the helmsman-beyond
lay only glowing darkness and the whis-
pering of the night he felt loneliness
like a cold hollow within his breast

  father and mother his tall brothers and
his laughing lovely sister the comrades of
youth the hard wild stout-hearted pirates
with whom he had sailed for such a long
and bloody time- where were they now 
where in all the blowing night were they 

  where was he and on what mission
sailing alone through a pit of darkness
on a ship of strangers what meaning
and hope in all the cruel insanity of the
world 

  suddenly he wanted his mother he
wanted to lay his head on her lap and
cry in desolation and hear her gentle voice
-no by the gods it wasnt her image
he saw it was a lithe and dark-haired
witch who was crooning to him and strok-
ing his hair-

  he cursed tonelessly and got up best
to go to bed and try to sleep his fancies
away he was becoming childish

  he went down the catwalk toward the
cabin as he neared it he saw a figure by
the rail darkly etched against a shimmering
patch of phosphorescence his heart
sprang into his throat

  she turned as he came near corun
she said i couldnt sleep come over
here and talk to me isnt the night beau-
tiful

  he leaned on the rail not daring to
look at the haunting face pale-lit by the
swirling sea-fire its nice he said clum-
sily

  but its lonely she whispered i


planet

stories

never felt so sad and alone before

  why-why thats how i felt he blur-
ted

  corun-

  she came to him and he took her with
a sudden madness of yearning

  perias the erinye snarled as they thrust
him out of her cabin he padded up and
down the deck for a while a sailor who
stood watch near the forecastle followed
him with frightened eyes and muttered
prayers to the amulet about his neck

  presently the devil-beast curled up be-
fore the cabin the lids drooped over
his green eyes but they remained un-
winkingly fixed on the door

v

under a hot sullen sky
the windless sea swelled in long slow
waves that rocked the tangled kelp and
ocean-grass up and down heavenward and
hellward to starboard the dark cliffs of
a small jungled island rose from an angry
muttering surf but there were no birds
flying above it

  corun pointed to the shore thats the
first of the archipelago he said from
here on we can look for the xanthi to
come at any time

  we should get as far into their terri-
tory as possible even to the black palace
said shorzon i will put a spell of invisi-
bility on the ship

  their sorcerers can break that said
chryseis

  aye so but when they come to know
our powers i think they will treat with
us

  theyd better smiled imazu grimly
steer on toward the island of the cas-
tle said shorzon to the pirate i go
to lay the spell

  he went into his cabin corun had a
glimpse of its dark interior before the
door was closed-draped in black and
filled with the apparatus of magic

  he will have to be in a trance physi-
cally to maintain the enchantment said
chryseis she smiled at corun and his
pulses raced come my dearest it is
cooler on the afterdeck

  the sailors rowed steadily sweat glis-

tening on their bare blue hides imazu
paced up and down the catwalk flicking
idlers with his whip corun stood where
he could keep an eye on the steersman and
see that the right course was followed

  it had been utter wonder till now he
thought unending days when they plowed
through seas of magic nights of joy such
as he had never known there had never
been another woman such as chryseis he
thought never in all the world and he
was the luckiest of men though he died
today he had been more fortunate than
any man ever dared dream

  chryseis chryseis loveliest and wisest
and most valiant of women-and she was
his before all the jealous gods she loved
him

  there has only been one thing wrong-
he said you are going into danger now
the world would go dark if aught befell
you

  and i should sit at home while you
were away and never know what had hap-
pened never know if you lived or died
-no no corun

  he laid a hand on the sword at his
waist they had given him arms and
armor again after she had come to him
logical enough he thought without re-
sentment-he could be trusted now as
much as if he were one of shorzons en-
sorcelled warriors

  but if this were a spell too the gods
deliver him from ever being freed of it

  he blinked there was a sudden breath
of chill on him and his eyes were blurring
-no no it was the ship that wavered
ship and men fading-he clutched at
chryseis she laughed softly and slipped
an arm around his waist

  it is only shorzons spell she said
it affects us too to some extent and
it makes the ship invisible to anyone with-
in seeing range

  ghost ship ghost crew slipping over
the slowly heaving waters there was only
the foggiest outline to be seen shadow
of mast and rigging against the sky glimp-
ses of water through the gray smoke of
the hull blobs of darkness that were the
crewmen sound was still clear he heard
the mutter of superstitious awe the crack
of pwhip and imazus oaths that sent
witch of the demon seas



the oars creaking and splashing again
coruns hand was a misty blur before his
eyes chryseis was a shadow beside him

  she laughed once more a low exultant
throb and pulled his lips down to hers
he ruffled the streaming fragrant hair
and felt a return of courage it was only
a spell

  but what were the spells he wondered
for the thousandth time he did not hold
with the simple theory that wizards were
in league with gods or demons they had
powers yes but he was sure that some-
how these powers came only from within
themselves chryseis had always evaded
his questions about it there must be some
simple answer to the problem some real
process as real as that of making a fire
behind the performances of the sorcerers
-but it baffled him to think what it might
be

  blast it all it just wasnt reasonable
that shorzon for instance should have
been able actually to change himself into
a jungle monster many times his size
yet he corun had seen the thing had
felt its wet scales and smelled its reptile
stink how

the ship plowed slowly on now
and then corun looked at the com-
pass straining his eyes to discern the
blurred needle otherwise they could only
wait

  but waiting with chryseis was remark-
ably pleasant

  it was at the end of a timeless time
perhaps half a day that he saw the xan-
thian patrol look he pointed therg
they come

  chryseis stared boldly over the sea the
hand beneath his was steady as her voice
so i see theyre-beautiful arent they

  the cetaraea came leaping across the
waves big graceful beasts with the shapes
of fish their smooth black hides shining
and the water white behind their threshing
tails astride each was a great golden form
bearing a lance they quartered across
the horizon and were lost to sight

  the crew mumbled in fear shaken to
their hardy souls by the terrible unhuman
grace of the xanthi imazu cursed them
back to work the ship went on

  islands slipped by empty of man-sign
they had glimpses of xanthian works
spires and walls rearing above the jungle
these were not the white colonnaded build-
ings of tauros or the timbered halls of
conahur-of black stone they were with
pointed towers climbing crazily skyward
once a great sea serpent reared its head
spouted water and writhed away all
creatures save man could sense the pres-
ence of wizardry and refused to go near
it

  night fell an abyss of night broken
only by faint glimmers of sea-fire under
the carpeting weed men stood uneasy
watch in full armor peering blindly into
the somber immensity it was hot hot and
silent

  near midnight the lookout shouted from
the masthead xanthi to larboard

  silence you fool called imazu
want them to hear us

  the patrol was a faint swirl and streak-
ing of phosphorescence blacker shadows
against the night it was coming nearer

  have they spotted us wondered
corun

  no breathed chryseis but theyre
close enough for their mounts-

  there was a great snorting and splash-
ing out in the murk the cetaraea were
refusing to go into the circle of shor-
zons spell voices lifted an unhuman
croaking the erinye the only animal who
did not seem to mind witchcraft snarled
in saw-edged tones eyes a green blaze
against the night

  presently the squad turned and slipped
away they know something is wrong
and theyve gone for help said corun
well have a fight on our hands before
long

  he stretched his big body suddenly
eager for action this waiting was more
than he could stand

  the ship drove on corun and chryseis
napped on the deck it was too stiflingly
hot below the long night wore away

  in the misty gray of morning they
saw a dark mass advancing from the west
coruns sword rasped out of the sheath
it was a long double-edged blade such
as they used in conahur and it was
thirsty

kill themi roared imazu kill the misbegotten snakesi

  get inside chryseis he said tightly

  get inside yourself she answered
there was a lilt in her voice like a little
girls he felt her quiver with joyous ex-
pectation

  the ghostly outlines of the ship wav-
ered thickened faded again flickered back
toward solidity suddenly they had sight
the vessel lay real around them they saw
each other in helm and corselet face look-

ing into tautened face

they have a wizard along-he broke
shorzons spell said the conahurian

we looked for that answered chry-
seis evenly but as long as shorzon keeps
fighting him there will be a roiling of
magic around us such that none of their
beasts will approach

she stood beside him slim and boyish
in polished cuirass and plumed helmet


	planet

shortsword belted to her waist and a bow
in one hand her nostrils quivered her
eyes shone and she laughed aloud well
drive them off she said well send
them home like beaten iaganaths

  imazu blew the war-horn wild brazen
echoes screaming over the sea his men
drew in the oars pulled on their armor
and stood along the rails waiting

  but did we come here to fight them
asked corun

  no said chryseis but weve known
all along that wed have to give them a
taste of our might before theyd talk to
us

  the xanthian lancers were milling about
half a league away as if in conference
suddenly someone blew a harsh-toned horn
and corun saw half the troop slide from
the saddle into the water so-theyll
swim at us he muttered

the attack came from all sides
converging on the ship in a rush of
foam as the xanthi neared corun saw
their remembered lineaments and felt the
old clutch of panic they werent human

  with the fluked tail one of them had
twice the length of a man the webbed
hind feet on which they walked ashore
were held close to the body the strangely
human hands carried weapons they swam
half under water the dorsal fins rising
over their necks were long with gills
near the blunt-snouted heads their grin-
ning mouths showed gleaming fangs the
eyes were big dark alive with cold in-
telligence they bore no armor but scales
the color of beaten gold covered back
and sides and tail they came in at fur-
ious speed churning the sea behind them

  chryseis voice rose to a wild shriek
perias perias-kill

  the erinye howled and unfolded his
leather-webbed wings like a hurled spear
he streaked into the air rushed down on
the nearest xanthian like a thunderbolt-
claws teeth barbed tail a blinding fury of
blood and death ripping flesh as if it were
parchment

  the ships ballista chunked and balls of
the ever-burning achaeran fire were hurled
out to fall blazing among the enemy chry-
seis bow hummed beside corun a xan-

stories

thian went under with an arrow in his
throat-the air was thick with shafts as
the crew fired

  still the xanthi rushed on ducking up
and down near impossible to hit the
first of them came up to the hull and
sank their clawed fingers into the wood
the sailors thrust downward with pikes
howling in fear-maddened rage

  the man near corun went down with
a hurled javelin through him at once
a huge golden form was slithering over
the rail onto the deck the sword in his
hand flashed another umlotuans weapon
was knocked spinning from his hand and
the reptile hewed him down

  corun sprang to do battle the swords
clashed together with a shock that jarred
the man backward corun spread his feet
and smote out his blade whirled down
to strike the shoulder gash the chest
and drive the hissing monster back

  with a rising cold fury corun followed
it up that for the long inquisition-that
for being a horror out of the sea bottom-
that for threatening chryseis the xan-
thian writhed with a belly ripped open
still he wouldnt die--he flopped and
struck from the deck corun evaded the
sweeping tail and cut off the creatures
head

  they were pouring onto the ship through
gaps in the line chryseis stood on the
foredeck in a line of defending men her
bow singing death battle snarled about
the mast men against monsters sword
and halberd and ax belling in cloven bone

  a giants blow bowled corun off his
feet the tail of a xanthian he rolled over
and thrust upward as the sea demon
sprang on him the sword went through
the heart hissing and snapping his foe
toppled on him he heaved the struggling
body away and sprang back to his stance

  to me bellowed imazu to me
men

  he stood wielding a huge battle ax by
the mast striking at the beasts that raged
around him lopping heads and arms and
tails like a woodman the scattered hu-
mans rallied and began to fight their way
toward him step by bloody step

  perias the erinye was everywhere a
flying fury ripping and biting and smash-
witch of the demon seas



ing with wing-blows corun loomed huge
over the men who fought beside him the
sword shrieking and thundering in his
hands imazu stood stolidly against the
mast smashing at all comers a rush of
xanthi broke past him and surged against
the foredeck the defenders beat them
off chryseis thrusting as savagely with
her sword as any man and they reeled
back against the masthead warriors to be
cut down

   a xanthian sprang at corun wielding a
long-shafted ax that shivered the sword
in his hand the conahurian struck back
his blade darting past the monsters guard
to stab through the throat the xanthian
staggered corun wrenched the blade loose
and brought it down again to sing in the
reptile skull

   before he could pull it loose another
was on him corun ducked under the
spear he carried and closed his hands
around the slippery sides the clawed feet
raked his legs he lifted the thing and
hurled it into another with bone-shattering
force one of them threshed wildly neck
broken-the other bounded at corun the
man yanked his sword free and it jvhis-
tled against the golden head

back and forth the struggle
swayed crashing of metal and howl-
ing of warriors and the xanthi were
driven to the rails-they could not stand
against the rallying human line in the
narrow confines of the ship

  kill them roared imazu kill the
misbegotten snakes

   suddenly the xanthi were slipping over-
board swimming for their mounts beyond
the zone of magic perias followed har-
rying them pulling them half out of the
water to rip their throats out

  the ship was wet streaming with hu-
man red and reptile yellow blood dead
and wounded littered the decks corun
saw the xanthi cavalry retreating out of
sight

  weve won he gasped weve won-

  no-wait- chryseis inclined her
head sharply seeming to listen then darted
past him to open a hatch light streamed
down into the hold it was filling-the
bilge was rising i thought so she said

             w

grimly theyre below us chopping into
the hull

  well see about that said corun and
unbuckled his cuirass all who can swim
after me

  no-no theyll kill you-

  come on gapped imazu letting his
own breastplate clang to the deck

  corun sprang overboard he was wear-
ing nothing but a kilt now and had a
spear in one hand and a drink in his teeth
fear was gone washed out by the red
tides of battle there was only a bleak
terrible triumph in him men had beaten
the sea demons

  underwater it was green and dim he
swam down down brushing the hull pull-
ing himself along the length of the keel
there were half a dozen shapes clustered
near the waist working with axes

  he pushed against the keel and darted
at them holding the spear like a lance
the keen point stabbed into the belly of
one monster the others turned their eyes
terrible in the gloom corun took the dirk
in his hand got a grip on the next nearest
and stabbed

  claws ripped his flanks and back his
lungs were bursting there was a roaring
in his head and darkness before his eyes
he stabbed blindly furiously

  suddenly the struggling form let go
corun broke the surface and gasped in a
lungful of air a sea demon leaped up
beside him at once the erinye was on
him the xanthian screamed as he was
torn apart

  corun dove back under water the
other seamen were down there fighting for
their lives they outnumbered the xanthi
but the monsters were in their native ele-
ment blood streaked the water blinding
them all it was a strange horrible battle
for survival

  in the end corun and imazu and the
others-except for four-were hauled back
aboard we drove them off said the
pirate wearily

  oh my dear - my dearest dear-
chryseis who had laughed in battle was
sobbing on his breast

  shorzon was on deck looking over the
scene we did well he said we stood
them off killed about thirty and only
	planet

lost fifteen men

  at that rate said corun it wont
take them long to clear our decks

  i dont think they will try again said
shorzon

  he went over to a captured xanthian
the sea demon had had a foot chopped
off in the battle and been pinned to the
deck by a pike but he still lived and rasped
defiance at them if allowed to live he
would grow new members-the monsters
were tougher than they had a right to be

  hark you said shorzon in the xan-
thian tongue which he had learned with
astonishing ease we come on a mission
of peace with an offer that your king will
be pleased to hear you have seen only
a small part of our powers it is not be-
yond us to sail to your palace and bring
it crumbling to earth

  corun wondered how much was bluff
the old sorcerer might really be able to
do it in any case-he had nerve 

  what can you things offer us asked
the xanthian

  that is only for the king to hear
said shorzon coldly he will not thank
you for molesting us now we will let you
go to bear word back to your rulers tell
them we are coming whether they will or
no but that we come in friendship if
they will but show it after all if they
wish to kill us it can be just as easily
done-if at all-after they have heard us
out now go

  imazu pulled the pike loose and the
yellow-bleeding xanthian writhed over-
board

  i do not think we will be bothered
again said shorzon calmly not before
we get to the black palace

  you may be right admitted corun
you gave them a good argument by
their standards

  friends muttered imazu friends
with those things as soon expect the
erinye to lie down by the bovan i think
come said chryseis impatiently we
have to repair the leak and clean the
decks and get under way again it is a
long trip yet to the black palace

  she turned to corun and her eyes were
dark flames how you fought she whis-
pered how you fought beloved

stories

          vi

he castle stood atop one
of the high gray cliffs which walled
in a little bay beyond the shore the island
climbed steeply toward a gaunt mountain
bare of jungle the sea rolled sullenly
against the rocks under a low gloomy sky
thickening with the approach of night

  the briseia rowed slowly into the bay
twenty men at the oars and the rest stand-
ing nervous guard by the rails on either
side the xanthi cavalry hemmed them
in lancers astride the swimming cetaraea
with eyes watchful on the humans and
behind them three great sea snakes under
direction of their sorcerers followed omin-
ously

  imazu shivered if they came at us
now he muttered we wouldnt last
long

  wed give them a fight said corun

  they will receive us declared shor-
zon

  the ship grounded on the shallows near
the beach the sailors hesitated to pull
her ashore would be to expose themselves
almost helplessly to attack go on jump
to it snapped imazu and the men
shipped their oars and sheathed their wea-
pons waded into the bay and dragged the
vessel up on the strand

  the chiefs of the xanthi stood waiting
for them there were perhaps fifty of the
reptiles huge golden forms wrapped in
dark flowing robes on which glittered ropes
of jewels a few wore tall miters and car-
ried hooked staffs of office like statues
they stood waiting and the sailors shiv-
ered

  shorzon chryseis corun and imazu
walked up toward them with all the slow
dignity they could summon the cona-
hurians eyes sought the huge wrinkled
form of tsathu king of the xanthi the
monsters gaze brightened on him and the
fanged mouth opened in a bass croak 

  so you have returned to us you may
not leave this time

  your majestys hospitality overwhelms
me said corun ironically

  a stooped old xanthian beside the king
plucked his sleeve and hissed rapidly i
toldqu sire i told you he would come
witch of the demon seas



back with the ruin of worlds in his train
cut them all down now before the fates
strike kill them while there is time
there will be time said tsathu

  his unblinking eyes locked with shor-
zons and suddenly the twilight shimmered
and trembled the nerves of men shook
and out in the water the sea-beasts snorted
with panic for a long moment that silent
duel of wizardry quivered in the air and
then it faded and the unreality receded
into the background of dusk

  slowly the xanthian monarch nodded
as if satisfied to find an opponent he
could not overcome

  i am shorzon of achaera said the
man and i would speak with the chiefs
of the xanthi

  you may do so replied the reptile
come up to the castle and we will quar-
ter your folk

  at imazus order the sailors began un-
loading the gifts that had been brought
weapons vessels and ornaments of pre-
cious metals set with jewels rare tapes-
tries and incenses tsathu hardly glanced
at them follow me he said curtly all
your people

  id hoped at least to leave a guard on
the ship murmured imazu to corun

  would have done little good if they
really wanted to seize her whispered the
conahurian

  it did not seem as if tsathu could have
heard them but he turned and his bass
boom rolled over the mumbling surf that
is right you may as well relax your
petty precautions they will avail nothing

in a long file they went up a
narrow trail toward the black palace
the xanthian rulers went first with de-
liberately paced dignity thereafter the hu-
man captains their men and a silent troop
of armed reptile soldiery hemmed in
thought corun grimly if they want to
start shooting-

  chryseis hand clasped his a warm grip
in the misty gloom he responded grate-
fully she came right behind him her
other hand on the nervous and growling
erinye

  the castle loomed ahead blacker than
the night that was gathering the gigantic

walls climbing sheer toward the sky the
spear-like towers half lost in the swirl-
ing fog there was always fog here corun
remembered mist and rain and shadow
it was never full day on the island he
sniffed the dank sea-smell that blew from
the gaping portals and bristled in recol-
lection

  they entered the cavernous doorway
and went down a high narrow corridor
which seemed to stretch on forever its
bare stone walls were wet and green-
slimed tendrils of mist drifted under the
invisibly high ceiling and he heard the
hooting and muttering of unknown voices
somewhere in the murk the only light
was a dim bluish radiance from fungoid
balls growing on the walls a cold un-
healthy shadowless illumination in which
the white humans looked like drowned
corpses looking behind corun could
barely make out the frightened faces of
the umlotuans huddled close together and
gripping their weapons with futile strength

  the xanthi glided noiselessly through
the mumbling gloom tall spectral forms
with faint golden light streaming from
their damp scales it seemed as if there
were other presences in the castle too
things flitting just beyond sight hiding
in lightless corners and fluttering between
the streamers of fog always it seemed
there were watching eyes watching and
waiting in the dark

  they came into a cavernous antechamber
whose walls were lost in the dripping twi-
light tsathus voice boomed hollowly be-
tween the chill immensities of it follow
those who will show you to your quarters

  silent xanthi slipped between the hu-
man ranks herding them with spears-
the sailors one way their chiefs another
where are you taking the men asked
imazu with an anger sharpened by fear
where are you keeping them the
echoes flew from wall to wall jeering
him-keeping them keeping them them
them-

  they go below the castle said a
xanthian you will have more suitable
rooms

  our men down in the old dungeons

coruns hand whitened on the hilt of his
sword but it was useless to protest unless
	planet

they wanted to start a battle now

  the four human leaders were taken
down another whispering echoing tunnel
of acorridor up a long ramp that seemed
to wind inside one of the towers and
into a circular room in whose walls were
six doors there the guards left them
fading back down the impenetrable night
of the ramp

the rooms were furnished with
grotesque ornateness-huge hideously
carved beds and tables scaled tapestries
and rugs shells and jewels set in the mold-
covered walls narrow slits of windows
opened on the wet night darkness and
mist hid coruns view of the ground but
the faintness of the surf told them they
must be dizzyingly high up

  ill is this he said a few guards on
that ramp can bottle us up here forever
and they need only lock the dungeon gates
to have our men imprisoned below

  we will treat with them before long
they will be our allies said shorzon
his hooded eyes were on chryseis it was
with a sudden shock that corun remem-
bered days and nights of bliss and then
the violence of battle and the tension of
approach had driven from his mind the
fact that he had never been told what the
witch-pair was really here for it was
their voyage not his and what real good
could have brought them to this place of
evil

  he shoved his big body forward a
tawny giant in the foggy chill of the
central room it is near time i was told
something of what you intend he said
i have guided you and taught you and
battled at your side and ill not be kept
blindfolded any longer

  you will be told what i tell you-no
more said shorzon haughtily you have
me to thank for your miserable life-let
that be enough

  you can thank me that youre not be-
ing eaten by fish at the bottom of the
sea right now snapped corun by
breannach brannor ive had enough of
this

  he stood with his back against the
wall sweeping them with ice-blue eyes
shorzon stood black and ominous wrath

stories

in the smoldering sunken eyes chryseis
shrank back a little from both of them
but perias the erinye growled and flat-
tened his belly to the floor and stared
greenly at corun imazu shifted from foot
to foot his wide blue face twisted with
indecision

  i can strike you dead where you stand
warned shorzon i can become a monster
that will rip you to rags

  try it snarled corun just try it
chryseis slipped between them and the
huge dark eyes were bright with tears
are we not in enough danger now four
humans against a land of walking beasts
without falling at each others throats
i think it is the witchcraft of tsagu work-
ing on us dividing us-fight him

  she swayed against the conahurian
corun she breathed corun my dearest
of all-you shall know you shall be told
everything as soon as we dare but dont
you see-you havent the skill to protect
yourself and your knowledge against the
xanthian magic

  or against your magic beloved

  she laughed softly and drew him after
her into one of the rooms come corun
we are all weary now it is time to rest
come my dear tomorrow-

vii

day crept past in a blind-

ness of rain twice xanthians brought
them food and once corun and imazu
ventured down the ramp to find their
way barred by spear-bearing reptiles for
the rest they were alone

  it ate at the nerves like an acid shor-
zon sat stiff unmoving on a couch eyes
clouded with thought his gaunt body
could have been that of a khemrian
mummy imazu squatted unhappily carv-
ing one of the intricate trinkets with whose
making sailors pass dreamy hours corun
paced like a caged beast throttled rage
mounting in him even perias grew
restless and took to padding up and
down the antechamber passing corun on
the way the man could not help a half
smile he was growing almost fond of
the erinye and his honest malevolence after
the intriguing of humans and xanthi
witch of the demon seas



  only chryseis remained calm she lay
curled on her bed like a big beautiful ani-
mal the long silken hair tumbling darkly
past her shoulders a veiled smile on her
red lips and so the day wore on

  it was toward evening that they heard
slow footfalls and looked out to see a
party of xanthi coming up the ramp it
was an awesome sight the huge golden
forms moving with deliberation and pride
under the shimmering robes that flowed
about them some were warriors with
saw-edged pikes flashing in their hands
but the one who spoke was plainly a palace
official

  greeting from tsathu king of the de-
mon sea to shorzon of achaera the
voice boomed you are to feast with
the lords of the xanthi tonight

  i am honored bowed the sorcerer
the woman chryseis will come with me
for she is equal with me

  that is permitted said the xanthian
gravely

  and we i suppose wait here mut-
tered corun rebelliously

  it wont be for long smiled chryseis
softly after tonight i think it will be
safe to tell you what you wish to know

  she had donned banqueting dress car-
ried up with her from the ship a clinging
robe of the light-rippling silk of hiung-nu
a scarlet cloak that was like a rush of
flame from her slim bare shoulders bar-
barically massive bracelets and necklaces
a single fire-ruby burning at her white
throat pearls and silver glittered like dew-
drops in her night-black hair the loveli-
ness of her caught at coruns throat he
could only stare with dumb longing as she
went after shorzon and the xanthi

  she turned to wave at him her whis-
per twined around his heart goodnight
beloved

  when they were gone the erinye pad-
ding after them imazu gave corun a rue-
ful look and said so now we are out
of the story

  not yet answered the conahurian
still a little dazed

  oh yes oh yes surely you do not
think that we plain sailormen will be
asked for our opinions no corun we
are only pieces on shorzons board weve

done our part and now he will put us
back in the box

  chryseis said-

  imazu shook his scarred bald head
sadly surely you dont believe a word
that black witch utters

  corun half drew his sword i told you
before that id hear no word against chry-
seis he said thinly

  as you will it doesnt matter anyway
but be honest corun strike me down
if you will it doesnt matter now but try
to think ive known chryseis longer than
you and ive never known anyone to
change their habits overnight-for any-
one

  she said-

  oh i think she likes you in her own
way you make as handsome and useful a
pet as that erinye of hers but whatever
else she is after it is something for which
she would give more than the world and
not have a second thought about it
corun paced unhappily i dont trust
shorzon he admitted i trust him as
i would a mad pherax and anything tsa-
thu plans is-evil he glared down the
cavernous mouth of the ramp if i could
only hear what they say

  what chance of that were under
guard you know

  aye so but- struck with a sudden
thought corun went over to the window
the rain had ceased outside but a solid
wall of fog and night barred vision it
was breathlessly hot and he heard the
low muttering of thunder in the hidden
sky

there were vines growing on
the wall tendrils as thick as a mans
leg the broad leaves hung down over
the sill wet with rain and fog i remem-
ber the layout of the castle he said slowly
its a warren of tunnels and corridors
but i could find my way to the feasting
hall

  if they caught you it would be death
said imazu uneasily

  coruns grin was bleak it will most
likely be death anyway he said i think
ill try

  im not as spry as i once was but-
  no no imazu you had best wait
	planet stories

here then if anyone comes prying and
sees you hell think were both here-
maybe

  corun slipped off tunic and sandals
leaving only his kilt he hung his sword
across his back put a knife in his belt
and turned toward the window

  it may be all wrong he said i
should trust chryseis-and i do imazu
but they might easily overpower her and
anything is better than this waiting like
beasts in a trap

  the gods be with you then said
imazu huskily he shook a horny fist to
hell with shorzon ive been his thrall too
long im with you friend

  thanks corun swung out the win-
dow good luck to both-to all of us
imazu

  the fog wrapped around his eyes like
a hood he could barely see the shadowy
wall and he groped with fingers and toes
for the vines one slip one break and he
would be spattered to red ruin in the court-
yard below

  down and down and down-twigs
clawed at him the branches were slick
in his hands buried under a smother of
leaves his muscles began to ache with
the strain several times he slipped -and
saved himself with a desperate clawing
grip-

  something moaned in the night under
the deepening growl of thunder

  he clung to the wall and strained his
eyes down a breath of wind parted the
fog briefly into ragged streamers through
which winked the savage light of a bolt
of lightning high in the murky sky down
below was the courtyard he saw the
metallic gleam of scales guards pacing
between the walls

  slowly he edged his way across the
out jutting tower to the main wall of the
castle slantwise he crept over its surface
until a slit of blackness loomed before
him another window he had to squeeze
to get through the stone scraping his skin

  for a moment he stood inside breath-
ing heavily the drawn sword in his hand
there was a corridor stretching beyond
this room on into a darkness lit by the
ghostly blue fungus-glow he saw and
heard nothing of the xanthi but some-

thing scuttled across the floor and crouched
in a shadowed corner watching him

  on noiseless bare feet he ran down
the hall fog eddied and curled in the
tenebrous length of it he heard the drip-
ping of water and once a shuddering
scream ripped the dank air he thought he
remembered where he was in that laby-
rinth-left here and there would be an-
other ramp going down-

  a huge golden form loomed around
the comer before the jaws could open
to shout coruns sword hissed in a vicious
arc and the xanthians head leaped from
his shoulders he kicked the flopping body
behind a door and sped on his way pant-
ing

  halfway down the ramp a narrow en-
trance gaped one of the tunnels that rid-
dled the building through its massive walls
corun slithered down its lightless wet
length it should open on the great cham-
ber and-

  black against the dim blue light of the
exit a motionless form was squatting
corun groaned inwardly they had a guard
against intruders then best to go back
now - no he snarled soundlessly and
bounded forward clutching the sword in
one hand and reaching out with the other

  fingers rasping across the scaly hide
he hooked the things neck into the crook
of his elbow and yanked the heavy body
back into the tunnel with one enormous
wrench blind in the darkness he stabbed
into the mouth driving the point of his
sword through flesh and bone into the
brain

  the dying monsters claws raked him
as he crouched over the body he re-
flected grimly that no matter how bene-
volent the xanthi might be he would die
for murder if they ever caught him but
he had no great fear of their suddenly
becoming tender toward mankind the
bulk of the reptile race was peaceable
actually but their rulers were relentess

  the tunnel opened on a small balcony
halfway up the rearing chamber wall
corun lay on his belly peering down over
the edge

they sat at a long table the lords
of the demon sea and he felt a dim
witch of the demon seas



surprise at seeing that they were almost
through eating had his nightmare journey
taken that long they were talking and
the sound drifted up to his ears

  at the head of the table tsathu and
his councillors sat on a long ornate couch
ablaze with beaten gold shorzon and
chryseis were reclining nearby sipping the
bitter yellow wine of the xanthi it was
strange to hear the hideous hissing and
croaking of the reptile language coming
from chryseis lovely throat

  -interesting i am sure said the
king

  more than that-more than that it
seemed to corun that he could almost see
the terrible fire in shorzons eyes the
wizard leaned forward shaking with in-
tensity you can do it the xanthi can
conquer achaera with ease your sea
cavalry and serpents can smash their ships
your devil-powder can burst their walls
into the air your legions can overrun their
land your wizardry blind and craze them
and the terror you will inspire will force
the people to do our bidding

  possibly you overrate us said tsathu
it is true that we have great numbers
and a strong army but do not forget that
the xanthi are actually a more peaceful
race than man your kind is hard and
savage murdering even each other mak-
ing war simply for loot or glory or no
real reason at all until the king-race
arose the xanthi dwelt quietly on the sea
bottom and a few small islands without
wish to harm anyone

  they have not even the natural capa-
city for magic possessed however unde-
veloped by all humans as a result they
are much more susceptible to it than men
thus when the king-race was born with
such powers they were soon able to con-
trol all their people and make themselves
the absolute masters of the xanthi but
we kings and wizards and lords of the
demon sea are all one interbred clan
without us the xanthi power would col-
lapse they would go back to what they
were

  even xanthi science is all of our mak-
ing we the king-race developed the devil-
powder and all that we have ever made
is stored in the dungeons of this very

building-enough to blow it into the sky

tsathu made a grimace which might
have been a sardonic smile do not
read weakness into that admission he
said even though all the lords who make
xanthian might are gathered in this one
room that power is still immeasurably
greater than you can imagine to show
you how helpless you are-your men are
locked into the dungeons and your geas
has been lifted from their minds
impossible gasped shorzon a geas
cannot be lifted-

  but it can what is it but a compulsion
implanted in the brain so deeply as to
supersede all other habits one mind can-
not erase that imposed pattern but several
minds working in concert can do so and
that i and my councillors have done as of
today your folk are free in soul hating
you for what you made them you are
alone

  the great scaled forms edged closer
menacingly coruns fist clenched about his
sword if they harmed chryseis-

  but she said cooly it does not matter
our men were simply to bring us here
nothing else we can dispense with them
what matters is our plan to impose magic
control over achaera

  and i cannot yet see what benefit the
xanthi would get of it said tsathu im-
patiently our powers of darkness are so
much greater than yours already that-
let us not use words meant to im-
press the ignorant among ourselves said
chryseis scornfully every sorcerer knows
there is nothing of heaven or hell about
magic it is but the imposition of- a pat-
tern on other minds it creates by control
of the senses illusions of lycanthropy or
whatever else is desired or it binds the
subject by the unbreakable compulsion of
a geas but it is no more than that-one
mind reaching through space to create
what impressions it wills on another mind
your devil-powder or an ordinary sword
or ax or fist is more dangerous-if the
fools only knew

  coruns breath hissed between his teeth
if-if that-o gods if that was the sec-
ret of the magicians-

  as you will said tsathu indifferently
	planet

what matters is that there are more of
our minds than your two and thus we
can beat down any attempt you may make
against us so it comes back to the ques-
tion why should we help you seize and
hold achaera what will we gain

  i should say nothing of its great
wealth said shorzon but it is true as
you say that many minds working to-
gether are immeasurably more powerful
than one-more powerful even than the
sum of all those minds working separately
i have worked with as many as a dozen
slaves having them concentrate with me
so that i could draw their mind-force
through my own brain and use it as my
own and the results have amazed me
now if the entire population of achaera
were forced to help us all at one time-

  the xanthis eyes glittered and a low
murmur rose among them shorzon went
on rapidly it would be power over the
world nothing could stand before that
massed mental force with us skilled sor-
cerers to direct and the soldiers of xan-
thi to compel obedience we could lay a
geas on whole nations without even hav-
ing to be near them we could span im-
measurable gulfs of space and contact
minds on those other worlds which phil-
osophers think exist beyond the upper
clouds we could by thus heightening our
own mental powers think out the very
problems of existence find the deepest
secrets of nature forces beside which your
devil-powder would be a spark drawing
life-energy from other bodies we would
never grow old we would live forever

  tsathu-lords of xanthi-i offer you
a chance to become gods

the stillness was broken only
by the muttering and whispering of
the xanthi among themselves mist drifted
through the raw wet night of the hall
the walls seemed to waver shift and blur
like smoke

  why could we not do this in our own
nation asked tsathu

  because as you yourself said the xan-
thi do not have the latent mental powers
of humans-save for you few who are
the masters it must be mankind who is
controlled with the commoners of your

stories

race as overseers

  and why could we not kill you and
do this ourselves

  because you do not understand hu-
mans the differences are too great you
could never control human thoughts as
chryseis or i could

  another xanthian spoke but do you
realize what this will do to the human
race your achaerans will become mind-
less machines under such control drained
of life-energy they will age and die like
animals i doubt that any will live ten
seasons

  what of that shrugged chryseis
there are other nations nearby to draw
on-conahur norriki khemri ultimately
the world we will have centuries re-
member-we will never die

  and you do not care for your own
race at all

  it will no longer be our race said
shorzon we will be gods thinking and
living and wielding such powers as they-
as we ourselves right now-could never
dream why do what you will with our
men here to start what does it matter
but do not harm the yellow-haired
man from conahur said chryseis sharply
hes mine-forever

  tsathu sat thinking like the statue of
a khemrian beast-god cast in shining gold
slowly at last he nodded and an eerie
sigh ran down the long table as the lords
of the xanthi hissed agreement

  it will be done said tsathu

  corun stumbled back down the tunnel
reckless of discovery blind and deaf with
madness that roared in his skull chryseis
-chryseis-chryseis-

  it was not the horror of the scheme
the ruin that it would bring even if it
failed the revelation of how immeasurably
powerful were the forces leagued against
man he could have stood that and braced
himself to fight it as long as there was
breath in his lungs but chryseis-

  she had been part of it she had helped
plan it had coldly condemned her whole
race to oblivion she had lied to him
cheated him betrayed him used him and
now she wanted him for a toy an im-
mortal puppet-witch witch witch
less human than the erinye at her feet
if
witch of the demon seas



than the xanthi themselves mad with
a cold madness such as he had never
thought could be-chryseis chryseis
chryseis i loved you with all my heart
i loved you

  there was no hope in him no longing
for anything but the fullest revenge he
could take before they hewed him to the
ground had the old xanthian wizard
foretold he would bring death aye by
the mad cruel gods who ruled mens des-
tinies he would

  he reached the corridor and began to
run

viii

down a long curving ramp

that led into a pit of blackness-
the dungeons could not be far they lay
this way-

 he hugged himself into the shadows
as a troop of guards went by they
were talking in their hoarse croaking lan-
guage and did not peer into the corners
of the labyrinth when they were past
corun sped on his way

 the stone walls became rough damp
tunnels hewed out of the living rock under
the castle he groped through a blackness
relieved only by the occasional dull glow
of fungi the darkness hissed and rustled
with movements he caught the glimmer
of three red eyes watching and something
slithered over his bare feet a far faint
scream quivered down the hollow length
of passages it had shaken him when he
was here before but now-

 what mattered what was important
save to kill as many of the monsters as
he could before they overwhelmed him

  the tunnel opened on a great cave whose
floor was a pool of oily black water as
he skirted its rim along a narrow slippery
ledge something stirred a misshapen giant
thing darker than the night it roared hol-
lowly and swam toward him a wave of
foul odor came with it catching coruns
throat in a sick dizziness

  he swayed on the edge of the pool and
the swimmer began to crawl out of it
toward him corun saw its teeth gleam
wetly in the vague blue light but there
were no eyes-it was blind he retreated



along the ledge toward the farther exit
the ground trembled under the bulk of
the creature

  its jaws clashed shut behind him as he
leaped free racing down the tunnel he
heard the bellowing of it like dull thunder
through the reeking gloom it wouldnt
follow far but that way of return would
be barred to him

  no matter no matter he burst out into
another open space it was lit by a dim
flickering fire over which crouched three
armed xanthi beyond the red light glim-
mered on an iron-barred doorway and
behind that there were figures stirring
men

  corun bounded across the floor the
sword shrieking in his hand it whirled
down to crash through the skull-bones of
one guard before he could free it the
other two were on him

  he ducked a murderous pike thrust and
slipped close to the wielder stabbing up-
ward with his dagger the xanthian
screamed and hugged corun close to him-
self fastening his jaws in the mans shoul-
der corun slashed wildly ripping open
the throat they tumbled to the ground
locked in each others arms raging like
beasts coruns knife glanced off the xan-
thians ribs and he felt the steel snap over
he got both hands into the clamped jaws
heedless of the fangs and wrenched the
jawbone cracked as he forced the reptiles
mouth open

  he rolled from beneath the still feebly
struggling creature and glared around for
the third that one lay in a hacked ruin
against the cell he had backed up too
close to the bars and the men inside still
had their weapons

gasping corun climbed to his feet
an eager baying of fierce voices
rolled out from the cell men gripped the
bars and howled in maddened glee

  corun- captain corun-get us out
of here-let us out to rip shorzons guts
loose-aaarrrgh

  the conahurian lurched over to a dead
xanthian at whose waist hung a bundle
of keys his hands shook as he tried them
in the lock when he got the door open
the men were out in a single tide

stories

  he leaned heavily on an umlotuans
arm what happened to you he asked

  the devils led us down here and then
closed the door on us snarled the blue
man later a group of them in rich
dress came down-and suddenly we saw
what a slavery wed been in to shorzon
suddenly it no longer seemed that obedience
to him was the only possible thing -
mwanzi let me at his throat

  you may have that chance said the
pirate he felt strength returning he
stood erect and faced them in the flicker-
ing firelight their eyes gleamed back at
him out of the shadows fierce as the
metal of their weapons

  listen he said we might be able
to fight our way out of here but wed
never escape across the demon sea but
 i know a way to destroy this whole cursed
house and every being in it if youll fol-
low me-

   aye the shout filled the cavern with
savage thunder they shook their weapons
in the air gleam of red-lit steel out of
trembling darkness aye

  corun picked up his sword and trotted
down the nearest passageway he was
bleeding he saw vaguely but he felt little
pain from it-he was beyond that now
the thing was to find the devil-powder
tsathu had said it was somewhere down
here

  they went along tunnel after winding
tunnel losing all sense of direction in the
wet hollow dark corun had a sudden
nightmare feeling that they might wander
down here forever blundering from cave
to empty cave while eternity grayed

  where are we going asked someone
impatiently where are xanthi to fight
i dont know snapped corun

  they came suddenly into another broad
cavern beyond which was another barred
door four xanthi stood guard in front
of it they never had a chance-the air
was suddenly full of hurled weapons and
they were buried under a pile of edged
steel

  corun searched the bodies but found
no keys in the murk beyond he could
dimly see boxes and barrels reaching into
fathomless distances but the door was
held fast of course-tsathu would never

trust his men-at-arms with entrance to
the devil-powder

  the corsair snarled and grabbed a bar
with both hands pull men of umlotu
he shouted pull

  they swarmed close thirty-odd big blue
men with the strength of hate in them
clutching the cell bars grabbing each
others waists heaving with a force that
shrieked through the iron pull

  the lock burst and they staggered back
as the door swung wide instantly corun
was inside ripping open a box and laugh-
ing aloud to see the black grains that
filled it

  for a wild moment he thought of plung-
ing a brand into the powder and going
up in flame and thunder with the castle
coldness returned - he checked himself
and looked around for fuses his followers
would not have permitted him to commit
a suicide that involved them and after
all-the longer he lived the more enemies
hed have a chance to cut down person-
ally

   ive heard talk of this stuff said one
of the men nervously is it true that set-
ting fire to it releases a demon 

  aye corun found the long rope-like
fuses coiled in a box he knotted several
together and put one end into the powder
the ignition of one container would
quickly set off the rest-and the cavern
was huge and filled with many shiploads
of sleeping hell

  if we can fight our way to our ship
and get clear before the fire reaches the
powder- began the umlotuan

  we can try that i suppose said
corun

  he estimated the burning time of his
fuse from memories of the use hed seen
the xanthi make of the devil-powder yes
there would be a fair allowance for escape
though he doubted that they would ever
reach the strand alive

  he touched a stick from the fire to
the end of the fuse it began to sputter
a red spark creeping along it toward the
open box lets go shouted corun

  they pounded along the tunnel heedless
of direction there should be an upward-
leading ramp somewhere-ah there it
was	-
witch of the demon seas



  up its length they raced past levels of
the dungeons toward the main floor of
the castle at the end there was a brighter
blue light than they had seen below up-
up

  up-and out

the chamber was enormous a
pillared immensity reaching to a ceil-
ing hidden in sheer height rugs and tap-
estries of the scaled xanthian weave were
strewn about and their heavy intricately
carved furniture filled it at- the far end
stood a towering canopied throne on which
sat a huge golden form other shapes stood
around it and there were pikemen lining
the walls at rigid attention

  through the haze of mist and twilight
corun saw the black robe of shorzon and
the flame-colored cloak of chryseis he
shrieked an oath and plunged for them

  a horn screamed and the guards sprang
from the walls to form a line before the
throne the humans shocked against the
xanthi with a fury that clamored through
the building

  swords and axes began to fly corun
hewed at the nearest grinning reptile face
felt the sword sink in and roared the war-
cry of conahur he spitted the monster
on his blade lifted it and pitchforked it
into the ranks of the guards

  tsathu bellowed and rose to meet him
suddenly the xanthian king was not
there it was a tentacled thing from the
sea bottom that filled the room a thing
whose bloated dark body reared to the
ceiling someone screamed - fear locked
the battlers into motionlessness

  magic it was a sneering rattle in
coruns throat he sprang into the very
body of the sea creature

  he felt the shock of striking its solid
form the rasp of its hide against him
the overwhelming poisonous stench of it
one tentacle closed around him he felt
his ribs snapping and the air popping from
his burst lungs

  it wasnt real his mind gasped through
the whirling agony it wasnt real he
plowed grimly ahead blind in the illusion
that swirled around him striking strik-
ing

-planet-january

  dimly through the roaring in his nerves
he felt his blade hit something solid he
bellowed in savage glee and smote again
again and again the smashing pressure
lifted he sobbed air into himself and
looked with streaming eyes as the giant
form dissolved into smoke into mist into
empty air it was tsathu writhing in pain
at his feet tsathu with his head nearly
chopped off it was only another dying
xanthian

  corun leaped up onto the throne and
looked over the room the guards and
the sailors were still standing in shaken
silence kill them roared the pirate
strike them down

  battle closed again with a snarl and a
clang of steel corun glared around after
other xanthi of the sorcerer breed there
were none in sight they must prudently
have fled into another part of the castle
well-let them

  but other xanthi were swarming into
the chamber battle horns were hooting
and the guttural reptile voices crying a
summons if the humans were not to be
broken by sheer numbers theyd have to
fight their way out soon   

  and down in the dungeons a single red
spark was eating its way toward a box
of black powder

  corun jumped down again to the floor
his sword leaped sideways cut a xanthian
spine across bit the tail from another
to me he bawled over here men of
umlotu

  the blues heard him and rallied gath-
ering into compact knots that slashed their
way toward where his dripping sword
whined and thundered he never stopped
striking he drove the reptiles before him
until they edged away from his advance

  the men formed into one group and
corun led it across the floor in a dash
for the looming doorway a red thought
flashed across his brain where were
shorzon and chryseis

  the xanthi scattered before the des-
perate human rush the men came out
into a remembered hallway-it led to the
outside corun recalled by breannach
brannor they might escape yet

  corun corun you sea-devil i knew
it was your doing


planet stories

  the conahurian turned to see imazu
bounding toward him with a bloody ax
in one hand imazu-thank all the gods
imazu was free

  i heard a noise of fighting and the
tower guards went off toward it gasped
the umlotuan captain so i came too
on the way i met shorzon and chryseis

  what of them breathed corun

  the blue warrior smiled savagely and
flung a red thing down at coruns feet
theres shorzons scheming head my
woman is free

  chryseis-

  imazu leaned on his ax panting

  she launched her erinye at me i ducked
into a room and slammed the door in its
face then came here through another en-
trance

  chryseis was loose-weve got to get
clear said corun the devil-powder is
going to go off any time now

  the xanthi were rallying they came
at the humans in another rush corun and
imazu and their best men filled the corri-
dor with a haze of steel backing down
toward the outer portal

  it was a crazy blur of struggle hewing
at faces that wavered out of night slap-
ping down thrusts and reaching for the
life of the enemy men fell and others
took their places in the line down the
corridor they retreated fighting to get
free and they left a trail of dead

  the end of the passage loomed ahead
and the monstrous iron door was swing-
ing shut

  chryseis stood in the entrance a wild
storm-wind outside sent her cloak flapping
about her red wings beating in the light-
ning-shot darkness about the devils rage
of the goddess face

  stay here she screamed stay here
and be cut down you triple traitor

  the nearest umlotuan sprang at her
the door clashed shut in his face-they
heard the great bolt slam down outside
they were boxed in the end of the hall
and the xanthi need only shoot them down
with arrows

  down in the dungeons the fuse burned
to its end a sheet of flame sprang up in
the opened box of powder reaching for
the stacks around it

ix

the first explosion came
as a muffled roar corun felt the
floor tremble under his feet men and
xanthi stood motionless looking at each
other with widening eyes in which a com-
mon doom arose

  so it ended shorzon and tsathu and
their wizard cohorts would be gone but
chryseis mad lovely chryseis was loose
and the gods knew what hell she could
brew among the leaderless xanthi

  the walls groaned as another boom
echoed down their length

  well death came to every man and
he had not done so badly co run began
to realize how weary he was he was
bleeding from wounds and breath was
raw in his lungs

  the umlotuans hammered on the door
in panic but the twenty or fewer sur-
vivors could never break it down

  the devil-powder roared the floor
heaved sickeningly under coruns feet he
heard the crash of collapsing masonry

  wait-wait-one chance one chance
by the gods

  be ready to run out when the walls
topple he shouted well have a little
time-

  the xanthi were fleeing in terror the
humans stood alone waiting while the
explosions rolled and banged around them
cracks zigzagged across the walls dust
choked the dank air

  crash 

  corun saw the nearer wall swaying
toppling the floor lifted and buckled and
he fell to the lurching ground all the
world was an insanity of racket and ruin

  the lintel caved in the portal sagged
corun leaped for the opening like a pounc-
ing erinye the men swarmed with it out
through the widening hole while the roof
came down behind them

  someone screamed a faint lost sound in
the grinding fury of sundering stone
rocks were flying-corun saw one of them
crack a mans head like a melon wildly
he ran as the outer facade came down

  there was a madness of storm outside
wind screaming to fill the sky driving
solid sheets of rain and hail before it

 n
witch of the demon seas



the incessant blinding lightning glared in
a cold shadowless brilliance the bawling
thunder drowned the roar of exploding
devil-powder they fought out through
the courtyard past the deserted outer gate

  there came a blast which seemed to
crack the sky corun was knocked down
as by a giants fist he lay in the mud
and saw a pillar of flame lift toward the
heavens with the castle fountaining up on
its wings thunder roared over the earth
shouting to the storm that raged in the
heavens

  corun picked himself up and leaned diz-
zily against a tree stripped clean by the
blast rain slanted across the ground
churning the mud beneath his feet the
livid lightning-glare blazing above vaguely
through ringing deafened ears he heard
the wild clamor of the sea looking down
the cataract which the upward trail had
become he saw the briseia rocking in the
wind where she lay on the beach

  he gestured to imazu who staggered
up to join him his voice was barely aud-
ible over the shouting wind take the
men down there we cant sail in this
storm but make the ship fast stand guard
over her if im not back when the storm
is done start for home

  where are you going  cried the umlo-
tuan

  ill be back-maybe stay with the
ship

  corun turned and slogged across the
ground toward the jungle

weariness was gone he was like
a machine running without thought
or pain until it burned out chryseis would
have fled toward high ground he thought
dully

  behind him imazu started forward
then checked himself something of the
ultimate loneliness that was in corun must
have come to the umlotuan it was not
a mission on which any other man might
go and they had to save the ship he
gestured to his few remaining men and
they began the slow climb down to the
beach

  the castle was a heap of shattered rock
still moving convulsively as the last few
oxes of devil-powder exploded the rain

                     

boiled down over it churning through
the fragments lightning flamed in the
berserk heavens

  corun pushed through underbrush that
clutched at his feet and clawed at his
skin the sword was still hanging loosely
in one hand nicked and blunted with bat-
tle he went on mechanically scarcely
noticing the wind-whipped trees that barred
his way

  it came to him that he was fighting for
khroman the thalassocrat of achaera
ruler by right of conquest over conahur
but there were worse things than foreign
rule if it was human and one of the
greater evils had fled toward the moun-
tain

  presently he came out on the bare rocks
above the fringe of jungle growth the
rain hammered at him driven by a wind
that screamed like a maddened beast
thunder boomed and rolled overhead a
roar of doom answering the thud of his
heart the water rushed over his ankles
foaming down toward the sea

  she stood waiting for him atop a high
bare hill her cloak was drawn tightly
about her slender body but the wind
caught at it whipped and tore it her
rain-wet hair blew wild

  corun she called under the gale
corun

  i am coming he said not caring if
she heard him or not he struggled up
to where she stood limned against the
sheeted fire in heaven they faced each
other while the storm raged around them

  corun-

  she read death in his eyes as he lifted
the sword pier form blurred the outlines
of a monster grew to his eyes

  he laughed bitterly i know what your
magic is he said you saw me kill
tsathu

  she was human again human and
lovely a light-footed spirit of the hurri-
cane her face was etched white in the
lightning-glare

but into the air his wings caught the
wind whirling him aloft twisting in mid-
flight he arrowed down corun struck at
him the erinye dodged the blow and
erne buffeting wingtip caught the mans
wrist the sword fell from coruns hand
at once the erinye was onjhim

  corun fell under that smashing attack
the erinyes fangs gleamed ahove his
throat the claws sank into his muscles he
flung up an arm and the teeth crunched
on it grinding at the bone

  corun wrapped his legs in a scissor-lock
around the gaunt body pressing himself
too close for the clawed hind feet to dis-
embowel him his free hand reached out
gouging-he felt an eyeball tear loose and
the erinye opened his mouth in a thin
scream corun pulled his tom arm free
he struck with a balled fist at the devil-
beast and felt his knuckles break under
the impact but bone snapped perias jaw
hung suddenly loose

  the erinye sprang back and corun
lurched to hands and knees perias edged
closer stiff-legged corun stumbled erect
and perias charged one great wing
smashed out brought the man toppling
back to earth perias leaped for his ex-
posed belly

  corun lashed out with both feet the
thud was dull and hollow under the rack-
eting thunder perias tumbled back and
corun sprang on him the barbed tail
slashed laying coruns thigh open he fell
atop the struggling beast and got his free
hand on the throat

  the mighty wings threshed half lifting
man and erinye corun pulled himself
over on the writhing back he locked legs
around the body arms around the neck
and heaved

  the erinye yowled his wings clashed
together with skull-cracking force barely
missing the head of the man who hugged
his back his tail raked against coruns
back seeking the vitals corun gave an-
other yank he felt the supple spine bend-
ing heave

  perias lifted a brassy scream the
strange dry sound of snapping vertebrae
crackled out corun rolled away from the
threshing form

  perias gasped lifted his broken head

and looked with filming green eyes at
chryseis where she stood unmoving against
the white fire of the sky slowly pain-
fully he dragged himself toward her
breath rattled in and out of his blood-filled
lungs

  perias- chryseis bent over to touch
the great head the erinye sighed his
rough tongue licked her feet then he
shuddered and lay still

  perias

  corun climbed to his feet and stood
shaking there was no strength left in
him-it was running out through a dozen
yawning wounds the ground whirled and
tilted crazily about him he saw her stand-
ing against the sky and slowly slowly
he came toward her

  chryseis picked up a stone and threw
it it seemed to take an immense time
arcing toward him some dim corner of
his buckling consciousness realized that it
would knock him out that she could then
kill him with the sword and escape into
the hills

  it didnt matter nothing mattered

  the stone crashed against his skull and
the world exploded into darkness

x

he woke up slowly and

painfully and lay for a long time
in a state of half-awareness remembering
only confused fragments of battle and
despair

  when he opened his eyes he saw that
the storm was dying lightning was wan
in the sky and thunder mumbled farewell
the wind had fallen the rain fell slow and
heavy down on him

  he saw her bending over him the
long wet hair tumbled past her face to
fall on his breast he was wrapped in
her cloak and she had ripped bandages
from her robe for his hurts

  he tried to move and could only stir
feebly she laid a hand on his cheek
dont she whispered just lie there
corun

  his head was on her lap he realized
dimly his eyes questioned her she
laughed softly under the falling rain

  dont you see she said didnt you

think of it shorzons geas was put on
me as a child i was always under his
will even when he was dead it was strong
enough to drive me along his road

  but i love you corun i will always
love you my love warred with shorzons
will even as i tried to kill you and when

i	saw you lying there helpless after such
a fight as no man has ever waged since
the gods walked the earth-

  i tried to stab you and i couldnt
shorzons geas was broken

  her hands stroked his hair you arent
too badly hurt corun ill get you down
to the ship with my witchs powers we
can win through any xanthi who try to
stop us-not that i think they will with
their leaders destroyed we can get safely
to achaera

  she sighed i will see that you escape
my fathers power corun if you will
return to the pirate life i will follow
you

  he shook his head no he whispered
no i will take service under khroman

if he will have me

  he will she vowed softly he needs
strong men and someday you can be
thalassocrat of the empire-

  it wasnt so bad thought corun drow-
sily khroman was a good sort a highly
placed conahurian could gradually ease
the burdens of his people until they had
full equality with achaera in a united and
peaceful domain

  the menace of the xanthi was ended
to be on the safe side achaera had better
make them tributary an expedition which
he corun could lead after that there
would be enough to keep a man busy
as well as the loveliest and best of women
for wife

  he slept he did not waken when imazu
led a squad up in search of him chryseis
laid a finger on her lips and a flash of
understanding passed between her and
the captain he nodded smiling and clasped
her hand with sudden warmth

  they bore the sleeping warrior back
through the rain down to the waiting ship

captain flandry opened
his eyes and saw a metal ceiling
simultaneously he grew aware of
the thrum and quiver which meant he
was aboard a spaceship running on ultra-
drive

  he sat up with a violence that sent the
dregs of alcohol swirling through his head
hed gone to sleep in a room somewhere
in the stews of catawrayannis with no
prospect or intention of leaving the dty


the haughty horned aliens from
the planet scotha had very well
organized intentions of conquer-
ing the terran empire-and cap-
tain dominic flandry terras ace
saboteur suddenly found himself
in a strategic position to louse up
the works how well achilles
had a heel    and what else
could you call a scothani

	planet

for an indefinite time-let alone the planet
now-

  the chilling realization came that he
was not aboard a human ship humanoid
yes from the size and design of tilings
but no vessel ever built within the borders
of the empire and no foreign make that
he knew of

  even from looking at this one small
cabin he could tell there were bunks
into one of which he had fitted pretty
well but the sheets and blankets werent
of plastic weave they seemed-he looked
more closely-the sheets seemed to be of
some vegetable fiber the blankets of long
bluish-gray hair there were a couple of
chairs and a table in the middle of the
room wooden and they must have seen
better days for they were elaborately hand-
carved and in an intricate interwoven de-
sign new to flandry-and planetary art-
forms were a hobby of his the way and
manner in which the metal plating had
been laid was another indication and-

he sat down again buried his
whirling head in his hands and tried
to think there was a thumping in his
head and a vile taste in his mouth which
liquor didnt ordinarily leave-at least not
the stuff hed been drinking-and now that
he remembered hed gotten sleepy much
earlier than one would have expected when
the girl was so good-looking-

  drugged-oh no tell me im not as
stupid as a stereo film hero anything but
that

  but whod have thought it whod have
looked for it certainly the people and
beings on whom hed been trying to get
a lead would never try anything like that
besides none of them had been around
lie was sure of it hed simply been out
building part of the elaborate structure of
demimonde acquaintances and information
which would eventually by exceedingly in-
direct routes lead him to those he was
seeking hed simply been out having a
good time-quite a good time in fact-
and-

  and now someone from outside the
empire had him and now what

   he got up a little unsteadily and looked

stories

around for his clothes no sign of them
and hed paid three hundred credits for
that outfit too he stamped savagely over
to the door it didnt have a photocell
attachment-he jerked it open and found
himself looking down the muzzle of a
blaster

  it was of different design from any he
knew but it was quite unmistakable cap-
tain flandry sighed relaxed his taut mus-
cles and looked more closely at the guard
who held it

  he was humanoid to a high degree
perhaps somewhat stockier than terres-
trial average-and come to think of it the
artificial gravity was a little higher than
one gee-and with very white skin long
tawny hair and beard and oblique violet
eyes his ears were pointed and two small
horns grew above his heavy eyebrow rid-
ges but otherwise he was manlike enough
with civilized clothes and a hooded cloak
he could easily pass himself off for human

  not in the getup he wore of course
which consisted of a kilt and tunic shining
beryllium-copper cuirass and helmet bus-
kins over bare legs and a murderous-
looking dirk as well as a couple of
scalps hanging at his belt

  he gestured the prisoner back and
blew a long hollow blast on a horn slung
at his side the wild echoes chased each
other down the long corridor hooting
and howling with a primitive clamor that
tingled faintly along captain flandry
spine

  he thought slowly while he waited no
intercom apparently not even speaking
tubes laid the whole length of the ship
and household articles of wood and animal
and vegetable fibres and that archaic cos-
tume there - they were barbarians all
right but no tribe that he knew about

  that wasnt too surprising since the
terrestrial empire and the half-dozen other
civilized states in the known galaxy ruled
over several thousands of intelligent races
and had some contact with nobody knew
how many thousands more many of the
others were of course still planet-bound
but quite a few tribes along the imperial
borders had mastered a lot of human tech-
nology without changing their fundamental
outlook on things which is what comes

r
tiger by the tail



of hiring barbarian mercenaries

  the peripheral tribes were still raiders
menaces to the border planets and merely
nuisances to the empire as a whole per-
iodically they were bought off or played
off against each other - or the empire
might even send a punitive expedition out
but if one day a strong barbarian race
under a strong leader should form a re-
liable coalition-then vae victis

a party of flandrys captors ap-
parently officers guardsmen and a
few slaves came down the corridor their
leader was tall and powerfully built with
a cold arrogance in his pale-bue eyes that
did not hide a calculating intelligence
there was a golden coronet about his
head and the robes that swirled around
his big body were rainbow-gorgeous
flandry recognized some items as having
been manufactured within the empire
looted probably

  they came to a halt before him and
the leader looked him up and down with
a deliberately insulting gaze to be thus
surveyed in the nude could have been badly
disconcerting but flandry was immune
to embarrassment and his answering stare
was bland

  the leader spoke at last in strongly ac-
cented but fluent anglic you may as
well accept the fact that you are a prisoner
captain flandry

  theyd have gone through his pockets
of course he asked levelly just to
satisfy my own curiosity was that girl in
your pay

  of course i assure you that the scot-
hani are not the brainless barbarians of
popular terrestrial superstition though-
a bleak smile-it is useful to be thought
so

  the scothani i dont believe ive had
the pleasure-

  you have probably not heard of us
though we have had some contact with the
empire we have found it convenient to
remain in obscurity as far as terra is
concerned until the time is ripe but-
what do you think caused the alarri to
invade you fifteen years ago

  flandry thought back he had been a
boy then but he had of course avidly

                    

followed the news accounts of the terrible
fleets that swept in over the marches and
attacked vega itself only the hardest
fighting at the battle of mirzan had
broken the alarri yet it turned out that
theyd been fleeing still another tribe a
wild and mighty race who had invaded
their own system with fire and ruin it
was a common enough occurrence in the
turbulent barbarian stars this one incident
had come to the empires notice only be-
cause the refugees had tried to conquer
it in turn a political upheaval within
the terrestrial domain had prevented
closer investigation before the matter had
been all but forgotten

  so you were driving the alarri before
you asked flandry with as close an
approximation to the right note of polite
interest as he could manage in his present
condition

  aye and others the scothani have
quite a little empire now out there in
the wilderness of the galaxy but since
we were never originally contacted by
terrestrials we have as i say remained
little known to them

  so - the scothani had learned their
technology from some other race possibly
other barbarians it was a familiar pat-
tern flandry could trace it out in his
mind spaceships landed on the primitive
world the initial awe of the natives gave
way to the realization that the skymen
werent so very different after all-they
could be killed like anyone else traders
students laborers mercenary warriors
visited the more advanced worlds brought
back knowledge of their science and tech-
nology  factories were built machines pro-
duced and some tribal king used the new
power to impose his rule on all his planet
and then to unite his restless subjects
he had to turn their faces outward promise
plunder and glory if they followed him
out to the stars-

  only the scothani had carried it farther
than most and lying as far from the
imperial border as they did they could
build up a terrible power without the
complacent politics-ridden empire being
more than dimly aware of the fact-until
the day when-

tt et us have a clear un-
l derstanding said the barbarian
chief you are a prisoner on a warship
already light years from llynathawr well
into the imperial marches and bound for
scotha itself you have no chance of
rescue and mercy depends entirely on your
own conduct adjust it accordingly
may i ask why you picked me up
flandrys tone was mild

  you are of noble blood and a high-
ranking officer in the imperial intelligence
service you may be worth something as
a hostage but primarily we want infor-
mation

 but i-

  i know the reply was disgusted
youre very typical of your miserable
kind ive studied the empire and its de-
cadence long enough to know that youre
just another worthless younger son given
a high-paying sinecure so you can wear a
fancy uniform and play soldier you dont
amount to anything

  flandry let an angry flush go up his
cheek look here-

  its perfectly obvious said the bar-
barian you come to llynathawr to track
down certain dangerous conspirators so
you register yourself in the biggest hotel
in catawrayannis as captain dominic
flandry of the imperial intelligence ser-
vice you strut around in your expensive
uniform dropping dark hints about your
leads and your activities-and these con-
sist of drinking and gambling and wench-
ing the whole night and sleeping the whole
day a cold humor gleamed in the blue
eyes unless it is your intention that the
empires enemies shall laugh themselves to
death at the spectacle

  if thats so began flandry thinly
then why-

  you will know something you cant
help picking up a lot of miscellaneous in-
formation in your circles no matter how
hard you try not to certainly you know
specific things about the organization and
activities of your own corps which we
would find useful information well
squeeze all you know out of you then
there will be other services you can per-

stotues

form people within the empire you can
contact documents you can translate for
us perhaps various liaisons you can make
-eventually you may even earn your
freedom the barbarian lifted one big
fist and in case you wish to hold any-
thing back remember that the torturers of
scotha know their trade

  you neednt make melodramatic threats
said flandry sullenly

  the fist shot out and flandry fell to
the floor with darkness whirling and roar-
ing through his head he crawled to
hands and knees blood dripping from his
face and vaguely he heard the voice
from here on little man you are to ad-
dress me as befits a slave speaking to a
crown prince of scotha

  the terrestrial staggered to his feet
for a moment his fists clenched the
prince smiled grimly and knocked him
down again looking up flandry saw
brawny hands resting on blaster butts-
not a chance not a chance

  besides the prince was hardly a sadist
such brutality was the normal order among
the barbarians-and come to think of it
slaves within the empire could be treated
similarly

  and there was the problem of staying
alive-

  yes sir he mumbled

  the prince turned on his heel and
walked away

they gave him back his clothes
though someone had stripped the
gold braid and the medals away flandry
looked at the soiled ripped garments and
sighed tailor-made-

  he surveyed himself in the mirror as
he washed and shaved the face that
looked back was wide across the cheek-
bones straight-nosed and square-jawed
with carefully waved reddish-brown hair
and a mustache trimmed with equal at-
tention probably too handsome he re-
flected wiping the blood from under his
nose but hed been young when he had
the plasticosmetician work on him maybe
when he got out of this mess he should
have the face made over to a slightly more
rugged pattern to fit his years he was
in his thirties now after all-getting to be

     
tiger ry

the tail



a big boy dominic

  the fundamental bone structure of head
and face was his own however and so
were the eyes-large and bright with a
hint of obliquity the iris of that curious
gray which can seem any color blue or
green or black or gold and the trim
medium-tall body was genuine too he
hated exercises but went through a dutiful
daily ritual since he needed sinews and
coordination for his work-and too a
man in condition was something to look at
among the usually flabby nobles of terra
hed found his figure no end of help in
making his home leaves pleasant

  well cant stand here admiring yourself
all day old fellow he slipped blouse
pants and jacket over his silkite under-
garments pulled on the sheening boots
tilted his officers cap at an angle of well-
gauged rakishness a d walked out to meet
his new owners

  the scothani werent such bad fellows
he soon learned they were big brawling
lusty barbarians out for adventure and
loot and fame as warriors they had cour-
age and loyalty and a wild streak of senti-
ment that he liked but they could also
fly into deadly rages they were casually
cruel to anyone that stood in their way
and flandry acquired a not too high re-
spect for their brains it would have
helped if theyd washed oftener too

  this warship was one of a dozen which
jcerdic the crown prince had taken out
on a plundering cruise theyd sacked a
good many towns even some on nominally
imperial planets and on the way back had
sent down a man in a lifeboat to contact
cerdics agents on llynathawr which was
notoriously the listening post of this sector
of the empire in learning that there was
something going on which a special agent
from terra had been investigating cerdic
had ordered him picked up and that was
that

  now they were homeward bound their
holds stuffed with loot and their heads
stuffed with plans for further inroads it
might not have neant much but-well-
cerdic and his father penda didnt seem
to be just ordinary barbarian chiefs nor
scothania an ordinary barbarian nation

  could it be that somewhere out there

                     

among the many stars someone had finally
organized a might that could break the
empire could the long night really
be at hand

  flandry shoved the thought aside he
had too much to do right now even his
own job at llynathawr important as it
was could and would be handled by some-
one else-though not he thought a little
sadly with the flandry touch-and his
own immediate worry was here and now
he had to find out the extent of power
and ambition of the scothani he had to
learn their plans and get the information
to terra and somehow spike them even a
little after that there might be time to
save his own hide

cerdic had him brought to the cap-
tains cabin the place was a typical
barbarian chiefs den with the heads of
wild beasts on the walls and their hides
on the floors old shields and swords hung
up in places of honor a magnificent golden
vase stolen from some planet of artists
shining in a corner but there were incon-
gruous modern touches a microprint
reader and many bookrolls from the em-
pire astrographic tables and computer a
vodograph the prince sat in a massive
carven chair a silkite robe flung carelessly
over his broad shoulders he nodded with
a certain affability

  your first task will be to learn sco-
thanian he said without preliminary as
yet almost none of our people even nobles
speak anglic and there are many who will
want to talk to you

  yes sir said flandry it was what
he would most have desired

  you had better also start organizing
all you know so you can present it co-
herently said the prince and i who
have lived in the empire will be able
to check enough of your statements to tell
whether you are likely speaking the truth
he smiled mirthlessly if there is reason
to suspect you are lying you will be put
to the torture and one of our sensitives
will then get at the truth

  so they had sensitives too telepaths
who coum tell whether a being was lying
when pain had sufficiently disorganized
his mind were as bad as the empires hyp-
planet stories



noprobes

  ill tell the truth sir he said

  i suppose so if you cooperate youll
find us not an ungrateful people there
will be more wealth than was ever dreamed
of when we go into the empire there
will also be considerable power for such
humans as are our liaison with their race
sir began flandry in a tone of weak
self-righteousness i couldnt think of-
oh yes you could said cerdic glumly
i know you humans i traveled incognito
throughout your whole empire i was on
terra itself i posed as one of you or
when convenient as just another of the
subject races i know the empire-its
utter decadence its self-seeking politicians
and pleasure-loving mobs corruption and
intrigue everywhere you go collapse of
morals and duty-sense decline of art into
craft and science into stagnancy - you
were a great race once you humans you
were the first to aspire to the stars and
we owe you something for that i suppose
but youre not the race you once were
the viewpoint was biased but enough
truth lay in it to make flandry wince
cerdic went on his voice rising there
is a new power growing out beyond your
borders young peoples with the strength
and courage and hopefulness of youth and
theyll sweep the rotten fragments of the
empire before them and build something
new and better

  only thought flandry only first comes
the long night darkness and death and
the end of civilisation the howling peoples
in the ruins of our temples and a myriad
petty tyrants holding their dreary courts
in the shards of the empire to say noth-
ing of the decline of good music and good
cuisine taste in clothes and taste in women
and conversation as a fine art

weve one thing youve lost said cer-
dic and i think ultimately that will be
the deciding factor honestly flandry
the scothani are a race of honest warriors
no doubt sir said flandry

  oh we have our evil characters but
they are few and the custom of private
challenges soon eliminates them said
cerdic and even their evil is an open
and clean thing greed or lawlessness or
something like that it isnt the bribery and

conspiracy and betrayal of your rotten j
politicians and most of us live by our 
code it wouldnt occur to a true scothani i
to do a dishonorable thing to break an 
oath or desert a comrade or lie on his r
word of honor our women arent running i
loose making eyes at every man they come 
across theyre kept properly at home titt
time for marriage and then they know
their place as mothers and houseguiders
our boys are raised to respect the gods
and the king to fight and to speak truth
death is a little thing flandry it comes
to everyone in his time and he cannot stay
it but honor lives forever

  we dont corrupt ourselves we keep
honor at home and root out disgrace with
death and torture we live our code and
that is really why we will win

- battleships help thought flandry and
then looking into the cold bright eyes
hes a fanatic but a hell of a smart one
and that kind makes the most dangerous
enemy	i

  aloud he asked humbly isnt any
stratagem a lie sir your own disguised
travels within the empire-

  naturally certain maneuvers are ne-
cessary said the prince stiffly nor does
it matter what one does with regard to
alien races especially when they have as
little honor as terrestrials

  the good old race-superority complex
too oh well

   i tell you this said cerdic earnestly
in the hope that you may think it over
and see our cause is just and be with us
we will need many foreigners especially
humans for liaison and intelligence and
other services you may still accomplish
something in a hitherto wasted life

   ill think about it sir said flandry
   then go

  flandry got

the ship was a good three weeks
en route to scotha it took flandry
about two of them to acquire an excellent
working knowledge of the language but
he preferred to simulate difficulty and com-
plained that he got lost when talk was too
rapid it was surprising how much odd
information you picked up when you were
thought not to understand what was being

   r-
tiger by

the tail



said not anything of great military signi-
ficance of course but general background
stray bits of personal history attitudes and
beliefs-it all went into the neat filing
system which was flandrys memory to
be correlated with whatever else he knew
or learned into an astonishingly complete
picture

  the scothani themselves were quite
friendly eager to hear about the fabulous
imperial civilization and to brag of their
own wonderful past and future exploits
since there was obviously nothing he could
do flandry was under the loosest guard
and had virtually the freedom of the ship
he slept and messed with the warriors
swapped bawdy songs and dirty jokes
joined their rough-and-tumble wrestling
matches to win surprised respect for his
skill and even became the close friend
and confidant of some of the younger
males

  the race was addicted to gambling
flandry learned their games taught them
some of the empires and before the
trips end had won back his stolen finery
plus several other outfits and a pleasantly
jingling purse it was-well-he almost
hated to take his winnings from these
overgrown babies it just never occurred
to them that dice and cards could be made
to do tricks

  the picture grew the barbarian tribes
of scotha were firmly united under the
leadership of the frithian kings had been
for several generations theoretically it
was an absolute monarchy though actually
all classes except the slaves were free
they had conquered at least a hundred
systems outright contenting themselves
with exacting tribute and levies from most
of these and dominated all others within
reach under pendas leadership a dozen
similar smaller barbarian states had al-
ready formed a coalition with the avowed
purpose of invading the empire capturing
terra destroying the imperial military
forces and making themselves masters
few of them thought beyond the plunder
to be had though apparently some of them
like cerdic dreamed of maintaining and
extending the imperial domain under their
own rule

  they had a formidable fleet-flandry

                     

couldnt find out its exact size-and its
organization and technology seemed far
superior to that of most barbarian forces
they had a great industry mostly slave-
manned with the scothan overlords super-
vising they had shrewd leaders who
would wait till one of the empires recur-
ring political crises had reduced its fight-
ing strength and who were extremely well
informed about their enemy it looked-
bad

  especially since they couldnt wait too
long despite the unequalled prosperity
created by industry tribute and piracy
all scotha was straining at the leash nobles
and warriors in the whole coalition foam-
ing to be at the empires throat a whole
galactic sector had been seized by the
same savage dream when they came roar-
ing in-well you never could tell the
empires fighting strength was undoubt-
edly greater but could it be mobilized in
time wouldnt penda get gleeful help
from two or three rival imperia  couldnt
a gang of utterly fearless fanatics plow
through the mass of self-seeking officers
and indifferent mercenaries that made up
most of the imperial power today

  might not the long night really be at
hand

ill

scotha was not unlike
terra-a little larger a little farther
from its sun the seas made turbulent by
three small close moons flandry had a
chance to observe it telescopically - the
ship didnt have magniscreens-and as
they swept in he saw the mighty disc roll
grandly against the galactic star-blaze and
studied the continents with more care than
he showed

  the planet was still relatively thinly
populated with great forests and plains
standing empty archaic cities and villages
huddling about the steep-walled castles of
the nobles most of its industry was on
other worlds though the huge military
bases were all on scotha and its moons
there couldnt be more than a billion scot-
hani all told estimated flandry probably
less and many of them would live else-
where as overlords of the interstellar do-
	planet

main which didnt make them less for-
midable the witless hordes of human-
kind were more hindrance than help to
-the empire

  cerdics fleet broke up the captains
bound for their estates he took his own
vessel to the capital iuthagaar and brought
it down in the great yards after the
usual pomp and ceremony of homecoming
he sent for flandry

  what is your attitude toward us now
he asked

  you are a very likeable people sir
said the terrestrial and it is as you say
-you are a strong and honest race
then you have decided to help us ac-
tively the voice was cold

   i really have little choice sir shrugged
flandry ill be a prisoner in any case
unless i get to the point of being trusted
the only way to achieve that is to give
you my willing assistance

  and what of your own nation

  a man must stay alive sir these are
turbulent times

  contempt curled cerdics lip some-
how i thought better of you he said
but youre a human you could only
be expected to betray your oaths for your
own gain

  surprise shook flandrys voice wasnt
this what you wanted sir

  oh yes i suppose so now come along
but not too close- you make me feel a
little sick

  they went up to the great gray castle
which lifted its windy spires over the
city and presently flandry found himself
granted an audience with the king of
scothania

  it was a huge and dimlit hall hung with
the banners and shields of old wars and
chill despite the fires that blazed along
its length penda sat at one end wrapped
in furs against the cold his big body
dwarfed by the dragon-carved throne he
had his eldest sons stem manner and bleak
eyes without the princes bitter intensity
-a strong man thought flandry hard and
ruthless and able-but perhaps not too
bright

  cerdic had mounted to a seat on his
fathers right the queen stood on his left
shivering a little in the damp draft and

stories

down either wall reached a row of guards-
men the fire shimmered on their breast-
plates and helmets and halberds they
seemed figures of legend but flandry no-
ticed that each warrior carried a blaster
too

  there were others in evidence several
of the younger sons of penda grizzled
generals and councillors nobles come for
a visit a few of the latter were of non-
scothan race and did not seem to be meet-
ing exceptional politeness then there were
the hangers-on bards and dancers and the
rest and slaves scurrying about except
for its size-and its menace-it was a typi-
cal barbarian court

flandry bowed the knee as required
but thereafter stood erect and met the
kings eye his position was anomalous of-
ficially cerdics captured slave actually-
well what was he or what could he be-
come in time

  penda asked a few of the more obvious
questions then said slowly you will
confer with general nartheof here head
of our intelligence section and tell him
what you know you may also make sug-
gestions if you like but remember that
false intentions will soon be discovered
and punished

  i will be honest your majesty

  is any terrestrial honest snapped
cerdic

  i am said flandry cheerfully as
long as im paid i serve faithfully since
im no longer in the empires pay i
must perforce look about for a new mas-
ter

  i doubt you can be much use said
penda

  i think i can your majesty an-
swered flandry boldly even in little
things for instance this admirably deco-
rated hall is so cold one must wear furs
within it and still the hands are numb
i could easily show a few technicians how
to install a radiant heating unit that would
make it like summer in here

  penda lifted his bushy brows cerdic
fairly snarled a terrestrial trick that
shall we become as soft and luxurious as
the imperials we who hunt vorgari on
ski
tiger by the tail



  flandrys eyes flitting around the room
caught dissatisfied expressions on many
faces inside he grinned the princes
austere ideals werent very popular with
these noble savages if they only had the
nerve to-

  it was the queen who spoke her soft
voice was timid sire is there any harm
in being warm  i-i am always cold these
days

  flandry gave her an appreciative look
hed already picked up the background of
queen gunli she was young pendas
third wife and she came from more south-
erly scothan lands than iuthagaar her
folk were somewhat more civilized than
the dominant frithians she was certainly
a knockout with that dark rippling hair
and those huge violet eyes in her pert face
and that figure too-there was a sup-
pressed liveliness in her he wondered if
she had ever cursed the fate that gave
her noble blood and thus a political mar-
riage

  for just an instant their eyes crossed

  be still said cerdic

  gunlis hand fell lightly on pendas
the king flushed speak not to your
queen thus cerdic he said in truth
this imperial trick is but a better form
of fire which no one calls unmanly we
will lei the terrestrial make one

  flandry bowed his most ironical bow
cocking an eye up at the queen he caught
a twinkle she knew 

nartheof made a great show of
blustering honesty but there was a
shrewd brain behind the hard little eyes
that glittered in his hairy face he leaned
back and folded his hands behind his head
and gave flandry a quizzical stare

  if it is as you say- he began

  it is said the terrestrial

  quite probably your statements so
far check with what we already know and
we can soon verify much of the rest if
then you speak truth the imperial organi-
zation is fantastically good he smiled
as it should be-it conquered the stars
in the old days but its no better than
the beings who man it and everyone knows
how venial and cowardly the imperials are
today

                      

  flandry said nothing but he remem-
bered the gallantry of the sirian units at
garrapoli and the dogged courage of the
valatian legion and-well why go on
the haughty scothani just didnt seem
able to realize that a state as absolutely
decadent as they imagined the empire to
be wouldnt have endured long enough
to be their own enemy

  well have to reorganize everything
said nartheof i dont care whether what
you say is true or not it makes good sense
our whole setup is outmoded its ridicu-
lous for instance to give commands ac-
cording to nobility and blind courage in-
stead of proven intelligence

  and you assume that the best enlisted
man will make the best officer said
flandry it doesnt necessarily follow
a strong and hardy warrior may expect
more of his men than they can give you
cant all be supermen

  another good point and we should
eliminate swordplay as a requirement
swords are useless today and we have
to train mathematicians to compute tra-
jectories and everything else nartheof
grimaced i hate to think what would
have happened if wed invaded three years
ago as many hotheads wanted to do we
would have inflicted great damage but
thats all

  you should wait at least another ten
or twenty years and really get prepared
cant the great nobles wouldnt stand
for it who wants to be duke of a planet
when he could be viceroy of a sector
but we have a year or two yet nartheof
scowled i can get my own service whipped
into shape with your help and advice i
have most of the bright lads but as for
some of the other forces - gods the dun-
derheads they have in command ive
argued myself hoarse with nornagast to
no use the fool just isnt able to see that
a space fleet the size of ours must have
a speical coordinating division equipped
with semantic calculators and-the worst
of it is hes a cousin to the king he ranks
me not much i can do

  an accident could happen to norna-
gast murmured flandry

  eh nartheof gasped what do you
mean 


planet stories

sjothing said flandry lightly

       but just for arguments sake
suppose-well suppose some good swords-
man should pick a quarrel with norna-
gast i dont doubt he has many enemies
if he should unfortunately be killed in
the duel you might be able to get to his
majesty immediately after before anyone
else and persuade him to appoint a more
reasonable successor of course youd
have to know in advance that thered be a
duel

  of all the treacherous underhanded-

  i havent done anything but speculate
said flandry mildly however i might
remind you of your own remarks its
hardly fair that a fool should have com-
mand and honor and riches instead of
better men who simply happen to be of
lower degree nor as you yourself said
is it good for scothania as a whole

  i wont hear of any such terrestrial
vileness

  of course not i was just-well spec-
ulating i cant help it all terrestrials
have dirty minds but we did conquer the
stars once

  a man might go far if only-no
nartheof shook himself a warrior
doesnt bury his hands in muck

  no but he might use a pitchfork
tools dont mind dirt the man who
wields them doesnt even have to know
the details-but lets get back to business
flandry relaxed even more lazily heres
a nice little bit of information which only
highly placed imperials know the empire
has a lot of arsenals and munitions dumps
which are guarded by nothing but secrecy
the emperor doesnt dare trust certain
units to guard such sources of power and
he cant spare enough reliable legions to
watch them all so obscure uninhabited
planets are used nartheofs eyes were
utterly intent now i know of only one
but its a good prospect an uninhabited
barren system not many parsecs inside the
border the second planet honeycombed
with underground works that are crammed
with spaceships atomic bombs fuel -
power enough to wreck a world a small
swift fleet could get there take most of
the stores and destroy the rest before
the nearest garrison could ever arrive in

defense

  is that-true

  you can easily find out if im lying
itll cost you that small unit thats all-
and i assure you ive no desire to be tor-
tured to death

  holy gods nartheof quivered ive
got to tell cerdic now right away-
you could or you might simply go
there yourself without telling anyone if
cerdic knows hell be the one to lead the
raid if you went youd get the honor
-and the power-

  cerdic would-not like it

  too late then he could hardly chal-
lenge you for so bold and successful a
stroke

  and he is getting too proud of him-
self-he could stand a little taking down
nartheof chuckled a deep vibration in
his shaggy breasf aye by valtams
beard ill do it give me the figures
now-

  presently the general looked up from
the papers and gave flandry a puzzled
stare if this is the case and i believe it
is he said slowly it  be a first-rate
catastrophe for the empire why are you
with us human

  maybe ive decided i like your cause
a little better shrugged flandry maybe
i simply want to make the best of my
own situation we terrestrials are adapt-
able beasts but i have enemies here nar-
theof and i expect to make a few more
ill need a powerful friend

  you have one promised the barbarian
youre much too useful to me to be
killed and-and-damn it human some-
how i cant help liking you

iv

th e dice rattled down
onto the table and came to a halt
prince torric swore good-naturedly and
shoved the pile of coins toward flandry
i just cant win he laughed you
have the gods with you human

  for a slave im not doing so badly
thought flandry in fact im getting rich
fortune favors the weak highness he
smiled the strong dont need luck

  to theudagaar with titles said the
tiger ry

young warrior he was drunk wine
flushed his open face and spread in pud-
dles on the table before him were too
good friends by now dominic ever since
you got my affairs in order-

  i have a head for figures and of
course terrestrial education helps-torric
but you need money

  therell be enough for all when we
hold the empire ill have a whole system
to rule you know

  flandry pretended surprise only a
system  after all a son of king penda-
cerdics doing torric scowled blackly
the dirty avagar persuaded father that
only one-himself of course-should suc-
ceed to the throne he said no kingdom
ever lasted when the sons divided power
equally

  it seems very unfair and how does
he know hes the best

  hes the oldest thats what counts
and hes conceited enough to be sure of
it torric gulped another beakerful

  the empire has a better arrangement
succession is by ability alone among many
in-a whole group of families

  well-the old ways-what can i do
thats hardly warriors talk torric
admitting defeat so soon-i thought bet-
ter of you

  but what to do-f

  there are ways cerdics power like
that of all chiefs rests on his many sup-
porters and his own household troops he
isnt well liked it wouldnt be hard to
get many of his friends to give allegiance
elsewhere

  but - treachery - would you make a
brotherslayer of me

  who said anything about killing just
-dislodging let us say he could always
have a system or two to rule just as he
meant to give you

  but-look i dont know anything
about your sneaking terrestrial ways i
suppose you mean to dish-disaffect his
allies promise them more than he gives
  whats that word-bribery-i dont
know a thing about it dominic i couldnt
do it

  you wouldnt have to do it mur-
mured flandry i could help whats a

man for if not to help his friends 

	 

  earl morgaar who held the conquered
zanthudian planets in fief was a noble of
power and influence beyond his station
he was also notoriously greedy

  he said to captain flandry terres-
trial your suggestions about farming out
tax-gathering have more than doubled my
income but now the natives are rising in
revolt against me murdering my troops
wherever they get a chance and burning
their farms rather than pay the levies
what do they do about that in the em-
pire

  surely sir you could crush the rebels
with little effort said flandry

  oh aye but dead men dont pay tri-
bute either isnt there a better way my
whole domain is falling into chaos

  several ways sir flandry sketched a
few of them-puppet native committees
propaganda shifting the blame onto some
scapegoat and the rest of it he did not
add that these methods work only when
skillfully administered

  it is well rumbled the earl at last
his hard gaze searched flandrys im-
passively smiling face youve made your-
self useful to many a scothanian leader
since coming here havent you theres
that matter of nartheof-hes a great man
now because he captured that imperial ar-
senal and there are others but it seems
much of this gain is at the expense of
other scothani rather than of the empire
i still wonder about nornagasts death-
history shows that the prospect of
great gain always stirs up internal strife
sir said flandry it behooves the strong
warrior to seize a dominant share of power
for himself and so reunite his people
against their common enemy thus did
the early terrestrial emperors end the civil
wars and become the rulers of the then
accessible universe

  ummm - yes gain-power-wealth-
aye some good warrior-

  since we are alone sir said flandry
perhaps i may remark that scotha itself
has seen many changes of dynasty

  yes-of course i took an oath to the
king but suppose just suppose the best
interests of scothania were served by a

stories

newer and stronger family-

  they were into details of the matter
within an hour flandry suggested that
prince kortan would be a valuable ally-
but beware of torric who had ambitions
of his own-

	 

  there was a great feast given at the
winter solstice the town and the palace
blazed with light and shouted with music
and drunken laughter warriors and no-
bles swirled their finest robes about them
and boasted of the ruin they would wreak
in the empire it was to be noted that
the number of alcoholic quarrels leading
to bloodshed was unusually high this year
especially among the upper classes

  there were enough dark corners though
flandry stood in one a niche leading to
a great open window and looked over
the glittering town lights to the huge white
hills that lay silent beyond under the
hurtling moons above were the stars
bright with the frosty twinkle of winter
they seemed so near that one could reach
a hand up and pluck them from the sky
a cold breeze wandered in from outside
flandry wrapped his cloak more tightly
about him

  a light footfall sounded on the floor
he looked about and saw gunli the queen
her tall young form was vague in the
shadow but a shaft of moonlight lit her
face with an unearthly radiance she might
have been a lovely girl of terra save for
the little horns and-well-

  these people arent really human they
look human but no people of terra were
ever so-simple-minded then with an in-
ward grin but you dont expect a talent
for intrigue in women terrestrial or sco-
than so the females of this particular spe-
cies are quite human enough for anyones
taste

  the cynical mirth faded into an inde-
finable sadness he-damn it he liked
gunli they had laughed together often
in the last few months and she was
honest and warm-hearted and-well no
matter no matter

  why are you here all alone dominic 
she asked her voice was very quiet and
her eyes seemed huge in the cold pale
moonlight

  it would hardly be prudent for me to
join the party he answered wryly id
cause too many fights half of them out
there hate my insides

  and the other half cant do without
you she smiled well im as glad not
to be there myself these frithians are
savages at home- she looked out the
window and there were suddenly tears
glittering in her eyes

  dont weep gunli said flandry softly
not tonight this is the night the sun
turns remember there is always new
hope in a new year

  i cant forget the old years she said
with a bitterness that shocked him

  understanding came he asked quietly
there was someone else wasnt there
aye a young knight but he was of
low degree so they married me off to
penda who is old and chill and jomana
was killed in one of cerdics raids- she
turned her head to look at him and a
pathetic attempt at a smile quivered on
her lips it isnt jomana dominic he
was very dear to me but even the deepest
wounds heal with time but i think of all
the other young men and their sweet-
hearts-

  its what the men want themselves
but not what the women want not
to wait and wait and wait till the ships
come back never knowing whether there
will only be his shield aboard not to
rock her baby in her arms and know that
in a few years he will be a stiffened corpse
on the shores of some unknown planet
not-well- she straightened her slim
shoulders little i can do about it

  you are a very brave and lovely wo-
man gunli said flandry your kind
has changed history ere this and he sang
softly a verse he had made in the scothag
bardic form

    so i see you standing
    sorrowful in darkness

    but the moonlights broken
    by your eyes tear-shining-
    moonlight in the maidens
    magic net of tresses

    gods gave many gifts but

    gunli yours was greatest

  suddenly she was in his arms   t

 sviffash of sithafar was angry he
paced up and down the secret chamber
his tail lashing about his bowed legs
his fanged jaws snapping on the accented
scothanian words that poured out

 like a craieex they treat me he
hissed i king of a planet and an intel-
ligent species must bow before the dirty
barbarian penda our ships have the worst
positions in the fighting line and the last
chance at loot the swaggering scothani
on sithafar treat my people as if they
were conquered peasants not warrior al-
lies it is not to be endured

  flandry remained respectfully silent he
had carefully nursed the reptile kings
smoldering resentment along ever since the
being had come to iuthagaar for con-
ference but he wanted sviffash to think
it was all his own idea

  by the dark god if i had a chance
i think id go over to the terran side
exploded sviffash you say they treat
their subjects decently

  aye weve learned it doesnt pay to
be prejudiced about race your majesty
in fact many nonhumans hold terrestrial
citizenship and of course a vassal of the
empire remains free within his own do-
main except in certain matters of trade
and military force where we must have
uniformity and he has the immeasurable
power and wealth of the empire behind
and with him

  my own nobles would follow gladly
enough said sviffash theyd sooner
loot scothanian than terrestrial planets
if they didnt fear pendas revenge
many other of scothas allies feel like-
wise your majesty and still more would
join an uprising just for the sake of the
readily available plunder if only they were
sure the revolt would succeed it is a
matter of getting them all together and
agreeing-

  and you have contacts everywhere
terrestrial youre like a spinner weaving
its web of course if youre caught i shall
certainly insist i never had anything to
do with you

  of course your majesty

  but if it works-hah the lidless
black eyes glittered and a forked tongue
flickered out between the homy lips hah

the sack of scotha

no your majesty it is necessary that
scotha be spared there will be enough
wealth to be had on her province planets
why the question was cold emo-
tionless

  because you see your majesty we will
have scothan allies who will cooperate
only on that condition some of the power-
seeking nobles    and then there is a
southern nationalist movement which wish-
es separation from the frithian north 
and i may say that it has the secret leader-
ship of the queen herself  

       
flandrys eyes were as chill as his voice
it will do you no good to kill me duke
asdagaar i have left all the evidence with
a reliable person who if i do not return
alive or if i am killed later will take
it directly to the king and the people
the scothans hands clenched white
about the arms of his chair impotent rage
shivered in his voice you devil you
crawling worm

  name-calling is rather silly coming
from one of your history said flandry
a parricide a betrayer of comrades a
breaker of oaths a mocker of the gods-
i have all the evidence duke asdagaar
some of it is on paper some is nothing
but the names of scattered witnesses and
accomplices each of whom knows a little
of your career and a man without honor
on scotha is better dead in fact he soon
will be

  but how did you learn- hopeless-
ness was coming into the dukes tone he
was beginning to tremble a little

  i have my ways for instance i learned
quite a bit by cultivating the acquaintance
of your slaves and servants you high-
born forget that the lower classes have
eyes and ears and that they talk among
themselves

  well- the words were almost stran-
gled what do you want

  help for certain others you have
powerful forces at your disposal-

      	 

  spring winds blew softly through the
garden and stirred the trees to rustling
there was a deep smell of green life about
them a bird was singing somewhere in

the twilight and the ancient promise of
summer stirred in the blood

  flandry tried to relax in the fragrant
evening but he was too tense-his nerves
were drawn into quivering wires and he
had grown thin and hollow-eyed so too
had gunli but it seemed only to heighten
her loveliness it had more than a hint
of the utterly alien and remote now

  well the spaceship is off said the
man his voice was weary aethagir
shouldnt have any trouble getting to ifri
and hes a clever lad-hell find a way
to deliver my letter to admiral walton
he scowled and a nervous tic began over
his left eye but the timing is so des-
perately close if our forces strike too
soon or too late it can be ruinous

  i dont worry about that dominic
said gunli you know how to arrange
these things

  ive never handled an empire before
my beautiful the next several days will
be touch and go and thats why i want
you to leave scotha now take a ship and
some trusty guards and go to alagan or
gimli or some other out-of-the-way planet
he smiled with one corner of his mouth
it would be a bitter victory if you died
in it gunli

her voice was haunted i should die
ive betrayed my lord-i am dishonored-
youve saved your people-your own
southerners and ultimately all scotha
but the broken oaths- she began to
weep quietly and hopelessly

an oath is only a means to an end
dont let the means override the end
an oath is an oath but dominic-
it was a choice of standing by penda or
by-you-

  he comforted her as well as he could
and he reflected grimly that he had never
before felt himself so thoroughly a skunk

v

the battle in space was
to the naked eye hardly visible-
brief flashes of radiation among the
swarming stars occasionally the dark form
of a ship slipping by and occulting a wisp
of the milky way but admiral walton
smiled with cold satisfaction at the to-
tiger by the tail



tality of reports given him by the semantic
integrator

 were mopping them up he said
our task force has twice their strength
and theyre disorganized and demoralized
anyway

 whom are we fighting wondered
chang the executive officer

  dont know for sure theyve split into
so many factions you can never tell who
it is but from flandrys report id say
it was-what was that outlandish name
now-duke markagravs fleet he holds
this sector and is a royalist but it might
be kelry whos also anti-terrestrial-but
at war with markagrav and in revolt
against the king

  suns and comets and little green as-
teroids  breathed chang this scothanian
hegemony seems just to have disintegrated
chaos everybody at war with everybody
else and hell take the hindmost howd
he do it

  i dont know walton grinned but
flandrys the empires ace secret service
officer he works miracles before break-
fast why before these barbarians snatched
him he was handling the llynathawr trou-
ble all by himself and you know how
he was doing it he went there with
everything but a big brass band did a
perfect imitation of a political appointee
using the case as an excuse to do some
high-powered roistering and worked his
way up toward the conspirators through
the underworld characters he met in the
course of it they never dreamed he was
any kind of danger-as we found out after
a whole squad of men had worked for
six months to crack the case of his disap-
pearance

  then the scothanians have been hold-
ing the equivalent of a whole army-and
didnt know it

  thats right nodded walton the
biggest mistake they ever made was to
kidnap captain flandry they should
have played safe and kept some nice harm-
less cobras for pets

uthagaar was burning mobs rioted
in the streets and howled with fear
and rage and the madness of catastrophe
the remnants of pendas army had aban-

                      

doned the town and were fleeing north-
ward before the advancing southern rebels
they would be harried by torrics guer-
rillas who in turn were the fragments of
a force smashed by earl morgaar after
penda was slain by kortans assassins
morgaar himself was dead and his rebels
broken by nartheof-the earls own band
had been riddled by corruption and greed
and had fallen apart before the royalists
counterblow

  but nartheof was dead too at the hands
of nornagasts vengeful relatives his
own seizure of supreme power and attempt
at reorganization had created little but con-
fusion which grew worse when he was
gone now the royalists were a beaten
force somewhere out in space savagely at-
tacked by their erstwhile allies driven off
the revolting conquered planets and swept
away before the remorselessly advancing-
terrestrial fleet

  the scothanian empire had fallen into
a hundred shards snapping at each other
and trying desperately to retrieve their
own with no thought for the whole lost
in an incomprehensibly complex network
of intrigue and betrayal the great leaders
fell or pulled out of the mess and made
hasty peace with terra war and anarchy
flamed between the stars-but limited war
a petty struggle really the resources and
organization for real war and its attendant
destruction just werent there any more

  a few guards still held the almost-de-
serted palace waiting for the terrestrials
to come and end the strife there was
nothing they could do but wait

  captain flandry stood at a window and
looked over the city he felt no great
elation nor was he safe yet cerdic was
loose somewhere on the planet and cerdic
had undoubtedly guessed who was respon-
sible

  gunli came to the human she was
very pale she hadnt expected pendas
death and it had hurt her but there was
nothing to do now but go through with
the business

  who would have thought it she
whispered who would have dreamed we
would ever come to this that mighty
scotha would lie at the conquerors feet

  i would said flandry tonelessly


planet stories

such jerry-built empires as yours never
last barbarians just dont have the talent
and the knowledge to run them being
only out for plunder they dont really
build

   of course scotha was especially sus-
ceptible to this kind of sabotage your
much-vaunted honesty was your own un-
doing by carefully avoiding any hint of
dishonorable actions you became com-
pletely ignorant of the techniques and the
preventive measures your honor was
never more than a latent ability for dis-
honor all i had to do essentially was
to point out to your key men the rewards
of betrayal if theyd been really honest
id have died at the first suggestion in-
stead-they grabbed at the chance so it
was easy to set them against each other
until no one knew whom he could trust-
he smiled humorlessly not many scot-
hani objected to bribery or murder or
treachery when it was shown to be to
their advantage i assure you most ter-
restrials would have thought further been
able to see beyond their own noses and
realized the ultimate disaster it would
bring

   still-honor is honor and i have lost
mine and so have all my people gunli
looked at him with a strange light in her
eyes dominic disgrace can only be
wiped out in blood

  he felt a sudden tightening of his
nerves and muscles an awareness of some-
thing deadly rising before him what do
you mean

  she had lifted the blaster from his
holster and skipped out of reach before
he could move no-stay there her
voice was shrill dominic you are a
cunning man but are you a brave one

he stood still before the menace
of the weapon i think- he
groped for words no she wasnt crazy
but she wasnt really human and she
had the barbarians fanatical code in her
as well easy easy-or death would spit
at him-i think i took a few chances
gunli

   aye but you never fought you havent
stood up man to man and battled as a war-
-rior should pain racked her thin lovely

face she was breathing hard now its
for you as well as him dominic he has
to have his chance to avenge his father-
himself-fallen scotha-and you have to
have a chance too if you can win then
you are the stronger and have the right-
might makes right it was after all
the one unbreakable law of scotha the
old trial by combat here on a foreign
planet many light-years from green ter-
ra-

  cerdic came in he had a sword in
either hand and there was a savage glee
in his bloodshot eyes

  i let him in dominic said gunli she
was crying now i had to penda was my
lord-but kill him kill him

  with a convulsive movement she threw
the blaster out of the window cerdic
gave her an inquiring look her voice
was almost inaudible i might not be able
to stand it i might shoot you cerdic
thanks he ripped the word out sav-
agely ill deal with you later traitress
meanwhile- a terrible laughter bubbled
in his throat- ill carve your-friend-
into many small pieces because who
among the so-civilized terrestrials can
handle a sword

  gunli seemed to collapse o gods o
almighty gods-i didnt think of that-
suddenly she flung herself on cerdic
tooth and nail and horns snatching at his
dagger get him dominic she screamed
get him

  the prince swept one brawny arm out
there was a dull smack and gunli fell
heavily to the floor

  now grinned cerdic choose your
weapon

  flandry came forward and took one
of the slender broadswords oddly he was
thinking mostly about the queen huddled
there on the floor poor kid poor kid
shed been under a greater strain than
flesh and nerves were meant to bear but
give her a chance and shed be all right

  cerdics eyes were almost dreamy now
he smiled as he crossed blades this
will make up for a lot he said before
you die terrestrial you will no longer
be a man-

  steel rang in the great hall flandry
parried the murderous slash and raked
tiger by

the princes cheek cerdic roared and
plunged at him his blade weaving a net
of death before him flandry skipped back
sword ringing on sword shoulders against
the wall

  they stood for an instant straining
blade against blade sweat rivering off
them and bit by bit the scothans greater
strength bent flandrys arm aside sud-
denly the terrestrial let go striking out
almost in the same moment and the
princes steel hissed by his face

  he ran back and cerdic rushed him
again the scothan was wide open for
the simplest stop thrust but flandry didnt
want to kill him they closed once more
blades clashing and the human waited for
his chance

  it came an awkward move and then
one supremely skillful twist-cerdics
sword went spinning out of his hand and
across the room and the prince stood dis-
armed with flandrys point at his throat

  for a moment he gaped in utter stupe-
faction flandry laughed harshly and said
my dear friend you forget that delib-
erate archaism is one characteristic of a
decadent society theres hardly a noble
in the empire who hasnt studied scienti-
fic fencing

  defeat was neavy in the princes defiant
voice kill me then be done with it
theres been too much killing and you
can be too useful flandry threw his own
weapon aside and cocked his fists but
theres one thing ive wanted to do for a
long long time

  despite the scothans powerful but
clumsy defense flandry proceeded to beat
the living hell out of him

mtteve saved scotha all
vv scotha said flandry think
girl what would have happened if youd
gone on into the empire even if youd
won-and that was always doubtful for
terra is mightier than you thought-
youd only have fallen into civil war you
just didnt have the capacity to run an
empire-as witness the fact that your own



the tail	

allies and conquests turned on you the
first chance they got youd have fought
each other over the spoils greater powers
would have moved in scotha would have
been ripe for sacking-eventually youd
have gone down into galactic oblivion the
present conflict was really quite small-it
took far fewer lives than even a successful
invasion of the empire would have done
and now terra will bring the peace you
longed for gunli

  aye she whispered aye we deserve
to be conquered

  but you arent he said the south-
erners hold scotha now and terra will
recognize them as the legal government-
with you the queen gunli youll be an-
other vassal state of the empire yes
but with all your freedoms except the
liberty to rob and kill other races and
trade with the rest of the empire will
bring you a greater and more enduring
prosperity than war ever would

  i suppose that the empire is decadent
but theres no reason why it cant some-
day have a renaissance when the vigorous
new peoples such as yours are guided by
the ancient wisdom of terra the galaxy
may see its greatest glory

  she smiled at him it was still a wan
smile but something of her old spirit
was returning to her i dont think the
empire is so far gone dominic she
said not when it has men like you she
took his hands and what will you be
doing now

  he met her eyes and there was a sud-
den loneliness within him she-was very
beautiful-

  but it could never work out best to
leave now before a bright memory grew
tarnished with the day-to-day clashing of
personalities utterly foreign to each other
she would forget him in time find some-
one else and he-well-i have my work
he said

  they looked up to the bright sky far
above them the first of the descending
imperial ships glittered in the sunlight
like a falling star
task to luna

the rockets started
almost simultaneously from two
widely separated points on the great
curving surface of earth they reached up-
ward and outward-toward the moon

  it wasnt really so strange a coincidence
space navigation is governed by mathe-
matics and logic not politics the fact that
man-carrying spaceships happened to be
developed concurrently on two sides of an
iron curtain meant little to the universe
it happened thats all and there is a
proper time to launch such missiles when
that time came they were launched

  in a manner of speaking it was a race a
race wherein the prizes were such things as
gravity gauge and surveillance point
and impregnable launching sites the
contestants were earnest capable men
each certain that the moon must not fall
into the hands of the opponent it made a
stirring and patriotic picture vivid with
nationalistic fervor it was thrilling with
its taste of high adventure and self-sacri-
fice for each rocket pilot it was a personal
crusade against the thing he had been
raised to regard as the enemy  

  but somehow under -the steady cold
scrutiny of the eternal stars they must
have looked a little ridiculous    perhaps
just a tiny bit tragic too

harsh was the moon there
was black and there was white great
jagged cliffs and razor-backed mountains
slashed the pocked surface of the crater

floor humping themselves at the huge
unwinking stars the sun was a stark disc
of fire incredibly white hung in the black
sky the shadows were bottomless pools
within them there was nothing in the
sunlight the pumice soil glared white

  the russian rocket had crashed on
landing randick could see the tiny
buckled shape of it high on the mountain
no doubt the pilot was dead but he had to
be sure the risks were too great for any
unsupported assumptions he had to go
up there and see for himself

  ponderous in his pressure suit randick
emerged from the open lock of the anglo-
american rocket he slogged across the
pumice of the crater floor toward the spot
where the mountains sheer talus erupted
skyward if there were no trouble from
the russki he would return to his own
ship and begin setting up the first cell of
what would soon be the anglo-american
moon base as soon as he signalled a safe
landing and no opposition from the rus-
sian other rockets would come to add their
cells and presently there would be an
atomic rocket pointed dead at the heart of
every russian population center a rocket
each for moscow leningrad kiev vlad-
ivostok   

  randick frowned it would be a lot
simpler if the crash had finished the rus-
sian pilot he knew the russians had ex-
actly the same plan for the moon only
the rockets would be aimed at washington

their sides hurt with laughter
tears rolled down their faces  

     two rocketships bit into lunar dust two men-a yan-
     kee a russian - dueled in nightmare shadow and
     glare each eager to destroy the enemy what cosmic
     joke made them drop their weapons and die laughing

weight of the one-man bazooka on ran-
dicks back seemed suddenly very comfort-
ing

  randick knew himself to be on the very
edge of known territory his map showed
him that he was in the highest part of the
doerfel mountains behind him lay the
two great bowls of bailly and schickard
and far to the north he could see as he
climbed higher the smooth surface of the
mare humorum he looked up to the
spinelike ridge beyond afld slightly above
the wreck of the russian ship there was
a deep pass that slashed like a wound
into the backbone of the range he felt a
slight thrill beyond that cleft lay   
mystery the other side of the moon

  the suns rays beat down brutally even
through the heavily insulated suit ran-
dick could feel their searing touch all
around him stretched a jumbled nightmare
of black and white he was suddenly very
glad that he could not see the earth in the
sky the homesickness would be unbear-
able

  randick found himself frowning he
had no time for such thoughts he was a
soldier he reminded himself that up
there in the tangled wreckage of the
russian spaceship there might be another
soldier ready to kill him two human
beings on the moon each eager to kill
randick shook his head angrily he had no
right to let his mind dwell on such
things   

  he was within a hundred yards of the
wreck when a streak of fire and a sound-
less blast drove him into the shadows
pumice showered him from the starshaped
depression where the explosive missile had
struck randick cursed heartily the rus-
ski was very much alive and there wasnt
a thing wrong with his eyesight the shot
had been uncomfortably close

  unslinging his bazooka randick began
to work his way around behind the rus-
sian rocket a slight movement among the
wreckage caught his trained eye and he
launched a projectile at it it flared wick-
edly tearing fragments of metal loose and
flinging them fantastic distances down the
sheer slope of the ridge there was no
return fire

  randick broke out of the shadow and

ran for the cover of a large pumicestone
boulder farther up the draw a sun-
bright flash of fire spattered the loose soil
a dozen feet from him he slid for the
darkness on his belly that one had been
a near thing

  behind the boulder lay a trench-like
depression that sloped away up the draw
toward the pass randick dropped into it
and began to crawl laboriously upward
if he could flank the russki he could finish
this with one good shot another explosion
rocked the boulder he had just left ran-
dick didnt even look back

  he felt his breath rasping in his throat
and his body felt hot and sticky inside the
bulky pressure suit glancing down and
to his right he could see the proudly erect
shape of his own rocket far below on the
floor of the crater

  it took him almost thirty minutes to
reach the edge of the shadow that spilled
from the side of the mountain pass to
his left not ten feet away was the sudden
white glare of the pumice floor he was
well above and almost behind the wreck
of the russians ship his flanks were
heaving with the exertion of the climb as
he searched the buckled mass of the crash
for his opponent

  there seemed to be a dark shape wedged
in between two twisted bulkheads it
looked like a man with pounding heart
randick murmured a prayer and lifted his
bazooka aimed and pressed the firing
stud the shadow vanished in silent white
fire

  the return blast almost knocked him
down for a moment randick was stunned
wondering foggily where the shot had
come from then his brain cleared and he
realized that the russki too had climbed
to the pass leaving randick to fire at shad-
ows

  randick cursed himself for his danger-
ous stupidity the other must be among
those shadowy rocks directly across the
bright floor of the pass he raised his
bazooka carefully searching the stygian
blackness for some sign of movement his
finger curled around the firing stud   

ut of the corner of his eye
he saw the flare the russian rocket
task to lvtfa

erupted in a gout of bluish flame and the
whole mountain seemed to rock randick
stared stupidly at the glowing crater where
the ship had been for just an instant he
thought that perhaps a meteorite had
struck it but the explosion had been un-
questionably    atomic

  the russian must have been stunned
too for he moved out into the light
empty-handed his helmet turned wood-
enly toward the rapidly cooling lake of
magma where his space ship had been

  they both saw the bright arc of fire
that raced up from beyond the ridge and
curved down gracefully toward the floor
of the crater far below openmouthed
randick watched his ship vanish into flame
and he felt the vague tremor of the
ground under him as the shock rumbled
across the face of the moon

  the russian rocket was gone the
anglo-american rocket was gone moon-
base was gone before it had ever been

  the weapon fell from randicks hand
and he stepped unsteadily into the light
toward the russian suddenly human com-



panionship was very very important
panicky terror was plucking at his throat

  the two men stumbled toward each
other across the pass cut deep into the
jagged back of the doerfel mountains as
one they turned and looked out across the
vast expanse of the moons hidden face

  they were soldiers they knew an inva-
sion base when they saw one as far as the
eye could see fines of sleek mammoth
spaceships of unknown design stretched
away into the distance the face of the
vast unnamed mare was covered with
them

  suddenly randick felt himself begin-
ning to giggle he tried to stop but the
laughter welled up inside of him echoing
wildly within his confining helmet he
could see that the russian was laughing
too white teeth gleaming behind the plexi-
glass faceplate they laughed until they
gasped their sides hurt with laughter
tears rolled down their faces they were
arm in arm and still laughing when the
third rocket arced down on them from out
of the black and star-flecked sky

stories

captain james mcbride
didnt know exactly what to make
of it at first the first earthmen
ever to set foot on venus he and his
crew had come armed to the teeth fully
prepared to fight wild elephants giant
tigers prehistoric monsters or anything an
imaginative mind might dream up

  when they found evidence of absolutely
no danger at all they stood around with
their heavy weapons and felt mighty
foolish the only signs of animal life
were the small creatures that scampered
right up to the men and chattered at them
unafraid and birds more evident by sound
than by sight there were no trails made
by giant animals no heavy frightening
sounds in the jungle about them only a
misty drowsing calm

  the mist was always there they were
to find out later steaming up from the
wet ground by day and condensing in a
blanket of life-giving water by night
otherwise venus resembled mildly tropi-
cal earth without storm and tempest the
lack of these made one think of thunder
and lightning as some unseen unknown
entity bound to earth alone in chains of
gravity

  the only really unpleasant note was
the condition of the ship in which they
had come the underside was a mass of
twisted steel and buckled plates where it
had come down considerably harder than
it had ever been intended to come down
it was something that could never take to
space again even if the h tanks hadnt
been torn loose to gush out their con-
tents

  communication with earth was out a
transmitter small enough to fit the ship
and yet powerful enough to breach mil-
lions of miles of space as well as penetrate
two atmospheres just wasnt made the
expedition was on its own

  the orders were conditional if possible
they were to set up an outpost on venus
as others had done several years before
on mars consisting mainly of scientists
the crew was to find out all it could about
the new world in one year the second
ship would follow bringing engineers and
laborers the scientists were to have by
that time the information required to

form the first colony quickly wisely and
safely

  if confronted with insurmountable ob-
stacles they were to return at once to
earth with whatever information they
might have as to the nature of the obsta-
cles

  mcbride grinned in spite of his regret
over the loss of his ship and looked at the
wreckage that sort of made the orders
unconditional

  things could have been worse he
thought not one of the ten men in the
expedition had been lost or even badly
injured and venus being the land of
plenty that it had turned out to be it was
beginning to look as if the stay here would
be a pleasant one

  he was just starting to get some of
his old spunk back when jeff flaunders
came up to him with a worried frown on
his face

  because of the limited space aboard the
ship flaunders was a combination of sev-
eral men as were most of the others
specially trained for the expedition he
handled anything that went under the
heading of botany biology or zoology

  now he was looking worried

  you look a lot like bad news mc-
bride said as flaunders drew near
might have known thered be a catch
to this world

  more than a catch flaunders said
i hope none of the men has eaten any-
thing native to venus

  mcbride shook his head they havent
if theyve followed orders i told them
not to touch anything until you had made
a report he looked at the other ques-
tioningly poison

  we brought twelve white rats and
two monkeys along for experimental pur-
poses flaunders said now we have
only six rats each of the others we fed
a different kind of native fruit or meat
that was about five hours ago in the
past hour theyve gone into convulsions
one after another seemed to go blind too
died within minutes

  you tried it on just the six rats and
not the monkeys mcbride asked and
got a nod from flaunders then thats
just six things tested maybe something

 r
poison planet



edible will turn up yet

  small chance flaunders was positive
thompson used a little of his chemistry
and found a substance he couldnt identify
not only in the stuff we fed the rats but
in twenty-some other plants he even
found it in the flesh of the animals we
caught that makes it pretty certain that
it will be found in everything when the
rats died we pegged that substance as the
poison

  what to do about it is another ques-
tion since its entirely new to us it would
probably take years to find a way to neu-
tralize it and it plays such an integral
part in the structure of everything- on
venus that wed have one sweet time try-
ing to completely draw it out anyway a
lot of needed lab equipment was smashed
in the wreck that makes it even more of
a problem

  mcbride listened frowned and rubbed
his cheek in other words we might as
well give up any idea of living off the fat
of the land

  thats about the size of it flaunders
agreed our best bet the way things
stand now would be to try and have a
garden going before our supply of food
runs out

  check said mcbride but the seed
was brought along just in case the soil
and climate should prove suitable for
planting what do you make of that
climate ought to be just about perfect
flaunders grunted as to the soil
thompson and i will check on that right
away

in another day a few things had
been learned there was now no doubt
about the poisonous nature of venus the
infuriating thing about it was that the
creatures native to venus thrived about
them on food that would put out the lights
for good for any earth-born animal

  but that was not quite so hard to take
when they found that the soil was suitable
for earth crops that left nothing to get
excited about

 so they thought until venus turned
stubborn

 no one knew exactly how stubborn
venus could get until the garden location

was being cleared of weeds they had
gone over about fifty feet of the clearing
working earnestly and not bothering to
look back when one of the men-a lanky
individual called henry higgins-turned
to look back put one grimy fist on his
hip hunched his shoulders stuck out his
chin and hollered damn

  the others turned and looked surprised
not that higgins well-known exaggera-
tive ways any longer surprised them but
what higgins was looking at might sur-
prise anyone including the botanist in
flaunders

  the eight-or-ten feet of ground directly
behind the men was clear of weeds but
at the far edge of this cleared space little
green shoots were thrusting inquisitive
noses above the ground beyond these were
one-inch plants then two-inch and four
and six and eight on up they formed a
slope up to the edge of the clearing

  damn higgins said again and tossed
away his spade

  someone laughed uncertainly the
others scratched their heads cast blank
stares at one another and forgot how to
keep their mouths closed

  just what in blazes do you make of
that mcbride asked of flaunders

  flaunders could be quite an optimist
when he wanted to he was one of those
rare persons who seem to grow stronger
with each failure at least on the surface

  only what i see he replied not will-
ing to show consternation amazingly
rapid growth but theyre still only weeds
its just going to take a little applied
science

  maybe mcbride didnt like it but
ive done a little farming in my time
know what it is to worry a chunk
of farmland out of the raw and the
nature of earth is dead compared to this
bunk flaunders scoffed work cer-
tainly but well be eating fresh corn in
two months

  mcbride looked around seeing little you
wouldnt see on earth whats wrong with
me he thought its my place to keep
the spirits of the men up not to dampen
them flaunders is right of course this stuff
is still only vegetation even if it is styled
after jacks beanstalk jack chopped down


planet stories

the beanstalk and killed the giant our
giant is the threat of starvation but kill-
ing it is still a matter of stalk-chopping
if jack could do it so can we

it started out like that two
weeks of hacking and digging of spe-
cially prepared weed-killer and the aid of
every trick known to science and there
was a strip of dark rich ground all ready
for planting it looked like things were
really beginning to roll they did roll
right up against a blank wall

  a few days after the planting flaunders
was looking at a handful of black spider-
things and swearing under his breath the
shriveled spider-things were seeds brought
from earth they were shot through with
hairlike roots and that was the strange
thing it was strange because the roots
were not their own

  it took several more days for flaunders
to understand when he did he took on
an attitude faintly remindful of a cornered
rat in a spot but frustrated to fighting
anger the ship had contained enough
food for only about two months to begin
with and more than two weeks had now
come out of that starvation was becom-
ing a very real possibility in his mind

  were up against something big he
said peeved with himself for having to
admit it were fighting millions of years
of evolution

  mcbride sensed something disturbing ini
the others voice maybe a trace of fear
what do you mean he said

  flaunders enlarged a very long time
ago a war started here on venus it was
a war among plants you find the same
thing on earth too but not on this scale
there must have been certain aggressive
plants which threatened to force out all
others the others in order to survive
had to evolve into something even more
deadly to other plants once started it
had to keep going now after millions
of years theyve evolved into things cap-
able of vicious little tricks youd never
be able to count

  what happened to our seeds is one
of them some of the roots extend into
microscopic threads hardly more than
streaks of single molecules you cant dig

them out and they escape all the ordinary
weed-fighting methods one of their cute
little tricks is to attach themselves to other
plants and seeds and absorb them
strangely enough not harming their own
species add to that the rapid growth
almost comparable to the motion of the
minute hand of a clock and planting any-
thing from earth among them is some-
thing like throwing a housecat into a den
of wild lions

  a very pretty picture mcbride
groaned we cant go back to earth for
a year everything on venus is poison and
we have less than two months supply of
food now you as much as admit that
there will be no garden im suddenly get-
ting a headache

  i didnt say we had failed flaunders
said sharply im never going to by
thunder well beat this hellhole if it takes
every minute of our time

  that was a sane enough statement
they had the seeds and they had the soil
with good health and the will to work
what was to stop them

  only weeds

<tONLY WEEDS> mcbride said ten
weeks later they couldnt be re-
sponsible for this ten weeks of breaking
our backs and losing our minds and you
cant even tell that weve done anything
it must be a nightmare

  flaunders was a man all washed out
a man badly stung how hard for an
optimist to face defeat

  ten years he said reflectively thats
what it seems like thirteen since we
crashed lucky number

  a week since weve had anything to
eat said mcbride or has it been two
anyway its too late to think about a
garden and if you and thompson cant
find a way to make this stuff fit to eat-
there was no need to complete that sen-
tence

  flaunders said nothing seemingly ab-
sorbed in thought

  why dont you stop trying mcbride
said suddenly

  flaunders looked up as if he thought
he hadnt heard right why in the world
should i do that
poison

planet



  because as long as you try the rest
of us have hope mcbrides sunken
cheeks burned red he was somehow
ashamed of his thoughts but still de-
termined to voice them without that
hope we wouldnt go on waiting and starv-
ing there wouldnt be anything to wait
for maybe there isnt anyway do you
actually think there is any hope

  flaunders stared for a moment consid-
ering the suicide tendency behind mc-
brides words he turned away hardly
disturbed by the morbid idea i dont
really know he replied at last i dont
even think any more i just keep going like
an automaton not hoping and not giving
up thats my responsibility mine and
thompsons maybe we will find a way
and maybe not the only thing to do is
to keep dogging it till we drop

  no need to blame yourself for that
mcbride said god knows you tried
with all the generators of this and that
the sprayers and fires and wires strung
all over we looked like we were fighting
a real war instead of one against plants
flaunders snorted a hell of a lot of
good it did we destroyed the weeds and
the properties of the soil with them by
the time we reactivated the soil the weed
seeds had come on the wind same thing
all over again how much good did the
hothouse do us even with all the filters
nearly microscopic seed came in on our
clothing in our hair id rather fight ele-
phants or pre-historic monsters at least
theyre big enough to see and slow enough
to cope with

  these were two skeletons speaking of
starvation under a tree loaded down with
plump ripe fruit watching small animals
scamper the easy way out was all around
them they thought about it

  all together there had been ten men
now ten skeletons now ten scarecrows
with faces unshaven and dirty with cloth-
ing hanging in tattered strips and extra
holes punched in belts they were slowly
starving to death in the garden of para-
dise in the land of plenty and nothing
you would think could be worse than that

  but there was something worse it came
shortly the real hell started with a gun

-planet-j anuary

the gaunt men were sitting
around in a circle pow-wow fashion
pretending to work out an answer and all
feeling that there wasnt any when mc-
bride noticed heinie the cook handling
his automatic it wasnt the mere fact
that he was handling the weapon that de-
served notice it was the way he was
handling it

  heinie sat with a faraway look in his
eye that was now glistening and now lack-
luster fondling the gun in a way that
suggested something black words not
spoken but safety off a damp brow and
moody reflections

  heinie said mcbride anything
wrong 

  heinies eyes came back from that far
place with a start he laughed bitterly
anything wrong two weeks without a
damned thing to eat and the man wants
to know if anythings wrong

  no respect for rank now no more tin-
soldier discipline what penalty can you
impose upon a man mere days from
death 

 youd better put away the gun
heinie

  heinie stared back at mcbride with a
sort of thoughtful defiance he didnt put
away the gun

  then hand it over mcbride said and
started getting up

 stay where you are all of you

  heinies sunken eyes were suddenly
glaring at the others over the muzzle of
his gun the others settled back a little
afraid but not caring much

  as cook heinie was saying its my
place to prepare meals i havent been
doing my job now im going to

  dont let it get you down man mc-
bride cautioned its not your fault if
we havent-

  listen to me heinie cut in sharply
i happened to be in the navy when i
was only a kid and three other guys and
myself were once in a fix a lot like this
only we were adrift on the open sea in
a life-raft three of us kept from starving
to death but we had to draw straws to
do it the one who got the short one-
well ive been having nightmares about
it ever since god we didnt even have


planet stories

a fire-

  his voice trailed off his eyes drawing
inward with some shocking memory mc-
bride edged toward him

  hold it heinie ordered coming out
of the daze

  mcbride stopped half inclined not to
he wavered drew back and decided to
try and argue it out

  youre-sick he said say you do
kill one of us do you think you could
go through that lif e-raft thing again
do you actually think any of us starving
or not could bring ourselves to do what
you suggest

  im not going to go through it said
heinie but if i could be around to col-
lect id lay you ten to one that you
will

  mcbride shook his head negatively
stop being foolish you need a rest

  heinie did it then he did it quickly
before anyone had a chance to stop him
he jerked the muzzle of the automatic
up to his own temple

  so long suckers he shouted and
pulled the trigger

the loud report made the si-
lence that followed seem even more
silent the men who had come to their
feet stood like statues of a mad sculptor
watching the black hole turn red and gush
then it came dawning in their eyes the
hungry frightened hopeful fascination
the impact of conflicting thoughts it grew
stronger and burned in the sunken eyes
of these dead men who wanted to live
there was no mistaking the intent no
mistaking the desire

  mcbride saw it and understood good
lord no he said he tried to keep say-
ing it thinking it

  but he was as near death as the others
the mutual thought bloomed in his mind
like some evil flower it made him tremble
sweat suddenly stung his eyes ran into
his mouth	ion

  food slow miserable dedth on one side
and food on the other a chance to live
a little longer maybe flaunders would
find something in another week and one
meal might make the difference between
seeing that and not seeing it one wanted

to live you couldnt bring heinie back
anyway so why not live heinie had
wanted it that way a human is an animal
as much as a pig or a cow a chance
to live to hope again

  some part of his mind screamed at
him cannibal

  the only chance cried another part

  vulture said the soul-part with un-
nerving keening will you have loin or
perhaps the rump

  his flesh prickled the sweat flowed in
streams unheard murmurings distorted
his mind

  only this once for a little more time
- maggot dungworm - only another
week and maybe the venus ii months
ahead of time-fool not a chance die
now quickly-no no no still some
hope never give up never say die oh
god heinie why did you suggest it

  gibbering conflict a trend to insanity
the voices inside beat his brain against
his temple and raged the civilized man
went to his knees and drew back the
beast man thumped his chest and
screamed

  alright mcbride shouted wonder-
ing why his voice sounded so angry why
his face felt distorted he drew his feel-
ings within himself his voice grew flat
and quiet with bitter irony

  alright he said go ahead undress
the main course

when the meal ended the
hell came full stomachs restore
sanity the beast man lay down well fed
and sleeping to leave the civilized man
awake with his thoughts a new kind of
hell this one that started with a gun
you could see the fires of it burning the
face of every man

  like the extra-animated henry hig-
gins he sat with unnaturally red cheeks
puffed out beneath his beard eyes glassy
wet looking at mcbride as if harboring
some question too awful to ask there was
something of the frightened wild animal
about him as his eyes left mcbride and
jerked around from one face to another
then he was up and awkwardly running
in among the trees

  the men got up from the rough table
    
poison planet



that had been set up outside the ship they
got up and went away slinking like a
sex maniac leaving the scene of his crime
when his reason returns and he knows
his insanity they went away by them-
selves-those not too sick to walk-and
hid from one another

 but a man cant hide from himself
that was the hell this was not a life-
raft on the open sea every man told him-
self this was a green smiling world with
the smell of flowers on the air with plenty
of glistening tempting fruit growing wild
and enough game to make an indian
hunter call it the happy hunting ground
like a camping trip back on earth like
a picnic where you get drunk and start
eating and then sober up with the smell
of blood in your nostrils to find yourself
chewing the hair off the detached leg or
arm of your best friend

  what did every man tell himself that
it wouldnt happen again ever this terrible
thing when they found the strength and
courage to go back and clean up the re-
mains of a meal knowing it to be the
remains of a meal when they had put
what was left of heinie in a hole and
covered it with dirt and set up a stone
marker they promised one another it
would never ever happen again

  the next day they put it on paper in
black and white an agreement on the
third day they thought about it and on
the fourth day they began wondering why
they had done it and on the fifth day-
on the fifth day they found thompson
the chemist hanging from a tree a short
distance from the ship quite dead of
course and no one had to ask why he
had done it

 hunger madness walked among the
men they took thompson dowti from
the tree hunger madness whispered in
their ears they listened

 mcbride took out the agreement and
looked at it having heard the tempters
whisper he didnt think much it hurt
him to think but something that had
been done once-

  he looked at the men and saw an in-
escapable vise tightening he looked at him-
self and saw the same at his feet fell
the small fragments of the agreement



the creeping hell closed in
the real hell that had started with
a gun could these any longer think of
themselves as men after the second time
the change starts it gets a little easier
all you have to do is keep from looking
at anyone its nice to live with life
theres hope dont get cheated

  what happened one day surprised no
one eight of the ten remained two gone
thompson had been gone for days the
hunger returned the pendulum swung
back the beast man shoved out any re-
maining noble thought and screamed for
food the addict returns to his drug the
pervert to his revolting deed    as mad
as these the starving

  nor was mcbride surprised when he
found himself holding a little stick he
wasnt greatly disturbed when it turned
out to be the short one sympathy from
the others not a bit only a sort of
brooding resignation and hunger always
hunger

  flaunders mcbride said wheres
flaunders 

  dont worry the one who had passed
the straws said he took his chance with
us been working like a madman since
thompson went he wouldnt stop so i
took the straws in to him

  i dont care about that mcbride in-
formed but ive known him since we
were kids just felt that id like to-well
-maybe its better this way he started
slowly away

  where you going someone said sus-
piciously

  mcbride looked at the man with a feel-
ing part disgust part pity and a little of
something unexplainable he almost
laughed

  im not depriving you of your next
meal he said i just feel like being alone
for this

  he walked slowly on taking his thoughts
with him what was the purpose in all
this all a monotonous cycle constantly
repeated from the torture of starvation
to the torture of the shame and bitter
self-accusation that makes one despise
himself back to the starvation men slowly
becoming something lower than pigs and
knowing it all too well a satisfying of


planet

stories

the body at the expense of decency even
of sanity a hell within souls

  and all for what purpose to live
for how long and in what hideous way
there would be only one lonely and sick
man left long before help could come
what would that last man do go com-
pletely mad and try to devour himself
like the two snakes who met one sunny
afternoon and decided to swallow one an-
other each took hold of the tail of the
other and both swallowed and swallowed
until nothing at all remained there was
no purpose no purpose or reason at all

a short distance back among
the trees mcbride halted and looked
back there were bushes between the men
and himself this was it he drew his
automatic

  strange he thought i dont feel at all
like i should about this its just like
routine procedure something you do every
day i actually think im glad i came out
with the short straw

  he even thought coolly about the best
way to do it the heart not sure enough
the brain like heinie a little better but
what if there should be a nervous twitch
at the wrong time and a deflection caused
by the bone of the skull

  a babble of voices came to him as if
from a great distance through his
thoughts excited voices but he was in
a world of his own now all the others
were behind him cut off

  safety off he put the muzzle of the
automatic into his mouth and aimed it
sharply upward the most efficient way
probably his finger tightened

  he heard the deafening report and felt
the recoil jerk his arm down somewhere
he had heard that a man killed instantly
by a gun never lives to hear the report
it puzzled him why didnt he fall why
could he still see the green tangle of
venus and hear sounds

  there was a ringing in his ears and
a sickening shimmer before his eyes his
shocked mind refused to come back to
things for a moment who were these
laughing crying shouting skeletons whirl-
ing about him with their dirty beards and
red-rimmed eyes

  its flaunders someone shouted
hes done it

  done it mcbride repeated dumbly
done what

  then flaunders was shaking him by the
shoulders and grinning come out of it
man youre safe we all are now i
theres no need for any more of this-
gluttony dont you understand ive won
i know how to treat the fruit even the
edible animals of this world so we can
eat them and they wont hurt us a bit
mcbride tried to call order to mind
starting from the beginning he looked
dazedly at the gun in his hand

  flaunders laughed dont look so sur-
prised to be alive one of the men hit
your arm just in time you missed death
by an inch

  it was all too much at one time a skirl-
ing confusion

  that what you said about beating the
poison mcbride said are you sure
its not just something on paper some-
thing not proven

  lord no flaunders said fighting
down an urge to shout i had it worked
out yesterday but it still had to be tested
and the white rats and two monkeys we
brought along for experimental purposes
were gone so i went out last night and
gathered some fruit and treated it and
tried it on myself just look at me and
you have your answer i feel fine

  still dazed still not quite understanding
how everything had happened mcbride
started back toward the ship with the
others but one thing he knew venus had
been beaten

the meal was all day in the pre-
paring the eating was a gala event
a banquet a roaring party it lasted two
hours

  there wasnt any wolfing down when
you have been starving for weeks you
just dont start off that way you take
a small bite and wait until you are sure
it is safely down then you take another
small bite and wait again if you keep
doing that you have a chance of holding
what you eat

  they didnt mind this food was not
the kind you had to force yourself to
poison

planet



chew on like-some other things

  there were little animals looking some-
thing like rabbits but tasting more like
chicken fried golden brown there were
oranges that tasted like nothing of earth
and apples that reminded you of paw-
paws in fall seven different kinds of
meat there were and it seemed like a
hundred different kinds of fruits and nuts
and herbs there was even a juice that
proved mildly intoxicating all a little dif-
ferent but all delightfully temptingly
good

  well be eating like this every day
flaunders said maybe we can even set
up a bar with fruit-juice drinks and wine
and even invent a new kind of beer
big foamy schooners of beer on venus
wont the work crew be surprised when
they get here

  they let it run away with them it
went to their heads the warmth of in-
toxication the feel of stomachs filling out
all the things long missing now returning
in full force all at one time almost it
was too much almost death from ex-
cessive joy

  they went on and on like that the most
happy men ever they wanted it to go
on for ever but the feast had started
late and it ended late after the two
hours they felt like sleeping in fact they
felt a more relentless urge to sleep than
they ever had before

  the result of a full stomach they sup-
posed or the aftermath of months of hard-
ship let in by the sudden relaxation it
certainly wasnt a matter of choice who
wanted to sleep at a time like this a
time for staying up all night and cele-
brating but the sandman said no and
right now he had the advantage

  one by one they yawned stretched and
drifted off to bed like carefree children
and to hell with cleaning up that could
wait until tomorrow tomorrow it was
wonderful to have one to think about
tomorrow was a golden day

  the last to turn in was captain mc-
bride just as sleepy but not so carefree
he alone perhaps was not completely sat-
isfied underneath the powerful urge to
sleep was a question and that question
needed answering or did it in one way

it didnt really matter he went in and
f ound his bed in the darkness and decided
to forget the question

fifteen minutes later mc-
bride lay awake the great urge to
sleep was still there but sleep wouldnt
come no that was not it exactly he
wouldnt let it come he was fighting it
the question wouldnt go away and it
really did need answering after all

  moving around quietly in the darkness
he made sure that the men were sleeping
then he returned to the bed next to his
the one in which flaunders slept
flaunders he said softly

  the question grew in his mind flaun-
ders he called more urgently he jostled
the quiet form

  whats wrong said flaunders half
asleep

  nothing exactly i want to talk a bit
  better sleep the time is-

  go on mcbride said intently
flaunders fought himself awake noth-
ing half asleep didnt know what i was
saying what do you want

  mcbride lay down on his own bed
hardly able to keep his eyes open maybe
i want to talk about the garden of eden
about the pair who were told that a
certain fruit was death to them and about
a serpent who told them it wasnt
flaunders said nothing

  must have been quite a persuader that
serpent mcbride went on in dream talk
up until this morning i guess i might
have welcomed such a one and i dont
think i was alone in feeling that way
men were never intended to live the way
we were living we really didnt want to
live if we had to live that way we only
convinced ourselves that we did we were
caught in a hellish vise and each of us
knew it underneath so a talking serpent
who could convince us that the fruit of

v if

venus was not poison might not have
been such a bad idea

  why talk about that said flaunders
like a man talking in his sleep its over
weve beaten venus

  mcbride tried to open his eyes it was
too much trouble his own words seemed
to him like someone else talking far
away and unreal there was a feeling like
being detached from ones body

  beaten venus yes he said but im
wondering how i keep thinking how this
kind of poison acts probably affect us
as it did the rats and monkeys takes
four or five hours to act and it hasnt
been three since we started eating was
it only chance that your treatment of the
food took all day and had to be extended
up to the last moment before serving it
wasnt even sampled before three hours
ago and so i wonder

  flaunders voice seemed to come out
of a deep well lets get some sleep
mcbrides voice almost matched it not
yet i havent mentioned about the medi-
cal supplies we brought along even drugs
it would have been simple for the welcome
serpent to treat the food with something
to deaden pain to make us sleep through
it

  his voice trailed off in sleep his
thoughts drifting away with the night
still the question wouldnt go away it
forced him partly awake he didnt even
realize how little of a question it was
now his body was a chunk of lead not
able to move to speak required almost
more effort than he could muster

  flaunders you didnt its just fatigue
letdown after strain i know you wont
he if i ask you all i want is to hear
you say you didnt

  flaunders wouldnt have tried to move
if he could he lay on his back with his
hands folded on his chest appropriate
goodnight he said

you said the man from mars

  a youve proved that the sec-

youve been here youve wiped out rabies
measles and the common cold but sir
this latest proposal of yours is blasphe-
mous 

  the man from mars waved an append-
age in the direction of the secretarys
desk atop which a newspaper was lyinjj

allen k lang

   and the martian visi-
 means of solving it   

 open after reading what that paper has
 to say can you still doubt that what i pro-
 pose is necessary

   the young man in uniform crossed the
 room and picked up the newspaper he
 read the headlines aloud bitterly in-
 dian famine army storms

 lic bids for place in sun

  you could end that plague the as-
sistants voice was accusing

  i could of course the battles and the
starvation would still be with you though
why do you persist in treating the symp-
toms instead of the sickness i am an
objective observer far enough away from
your problems to see them dearly some-
thing which no human can ever hope to
do you earthlings suffer war and famine
and plague for one reason only that there
are four and eight-tenths billion of you
living on an earth which can feed only
about two and a half billion of you well
gentlemen the population of your planet
must be reduced by one-half if your race
is to survive

  couldnt we send our surplus popu-
lation to mars or to venus  the assistant
asked

  the man from mars winced the sands
of mars cant support cactuses much less
fields of wheat and rice and com venus
is a solid sea of formaldehyde solution
he glanced around to each of the three
men in the room to you my scheme
may seem heartless but would it be more
cruel to kill millions now than to allow
billions to die in continual war in the next
thousand years do you remember your
last such war  the ukrainian wheatlands
scorched to desert by the thermonuclears 
new england swept by epidemics of an-
thrax and tularemia all china tortured
by starvation and the hundred nagging
sicknesses that follow hunger

  yes i remember the secretary
rolled his pen between his fingers star-
ing at it how do you intend to-liqui-
date-the excess two billions

  i cant explain it to you you lack the
basic knowledge it will be quick and
painless though i promise then earth
will see peace and hope a new start

  i couldnt take all the responsibility for
this decision upon myself the secretary
said he glanced hopefully toward the
assistant and the young man in uniform
their eyes flinched away

  you might take a vote suggested the

man from mars he picked up the sec-
retarys scratch pad and ripped off three
sheets of paper just mark yes or no

i	will respect your decision after all im
only here to help you

  the secretary stared at the slip of paper
lying on his desk he glanced toward the
other two humans for encouragement but
the assistant was staring at the wall across
the room and the young man in uniform
was silently contemplating the carpet at
his feet

  convulsively the secretary scooched the
paper towartl him and scribbled his vote
folding the paper he looked demandingly
toward his two companions the young
man in uniform looked up then turned to
hold his paper against the wall as he wrote
his decision the assistant remained
seated holding the paper on top of a book
while he lettered out his vote

  the man from mars collected the three
ballots unfolded them and read the three
votes its two to one he announced
he crushed the papers into small white
pellets and tossed them out the open win-
dow what i have to do will be finished
by noon tomorrow

  the man from mars left the room clos-
ing the door very softly behind him the
other three sat silent a moment and then
got up and left without looking one an-
other in the face

the next day the secretary and
the assistant sat in the office staring
at the clock above the door at twelve-oh-
seven the door slammed open for the young
man in uniform

  is it done the assistant asked

  done of course its done the
young man in uniform leaned against the
door and shook with spasmic laughter
now theres food enough and room
enough for everyone the man from mars
promised to solve our population prob-
lem he did at twelve noon eastern

a short story

by

j t
mintosh

last man aboard the ionic

ii	was the engineer it was not
until a tall unhurried figure started
the long walk from the control tower that
the curiosity of the crew was satisfied
they knew him he was jeff bremner
a slow-speaking oldster who had made
many trips on the ionic ii and as far as
they were concerned could make many
more


	planet

  engineers were attached to no particular
ship or run they were government offi-
cials and not really engineers some of
them were cordially and automatically
hated on any ship they boarded they
were in theory at any rate in supreme
command in space and not every man
could take a job like that and look plea-
sant bremner was one who could he
could talk and he could listen he could
give advice if asked without sending in
little notes at the end of the journey
second officer smith revealed astonish-
ing ignorance of points  and  of the
spacemans code or spaceman j
brown appears to have had time since
the completion of his training to develop
a certain laxity in his application of the
section on discipline he would help out
in an emergency without reporting coldly
on the inefficiency or insufficiency of the
ships complement and if there was some
fault he had to report he would satisfy
himself that the -fault if unchecked was
liable to recur before he did so

  so there was friendliness and some re-
lief in the crews greetings as bremner
came aboard discipline on the ionic ii
was easy normally the ship was one of
the seven run by the small sapphire line
in which it was a tradition that directors
made some allowance for management
management was not harsh with captains
captains kept crew on a loose rein and
crew didnt bother themselves too much
essentia standards were maintained but
what was regarded as essential was the
spirit and not the letter of various codes
of laws men who had been warned that
for the duration of the run to venus and
back they might have to obey the letter
and not the spirit for a change relaxed
gratefully from the time that the keenest-
sighted among them recognised the thin
figure of bremner across the field

  hallo jeff said captain hofmeyer
stretching out his hand i thought you
were on leave

  i was bremner replied but it was
put back again he grinned not a young
grin but with the resignation of an old
man who was not as old or tired as he
pretended

  mmm said hofmeyer cautiously

stories

you wouldnt like to say whom you re-
placed 

  watson and if you dont take that
expression off your face ill describe it
in my report

bremner followed the captain

and his second officer to the control
room not as if he owned the ship but
like a passenger there on sufferance per-
haps he reflected he was too easy-going
no certainly he was but one couldnt
be vigilant and unapproachable on a hun-
dred trips for the sake of a situation which
might arise on the hundred and first

  he glanced casually at the papers if
they did not satisfy him he had power
even yet with all the passengers and cargo
aboard and the official take-off time twenty
seconds off to stop the trip but the
papers were all right they always were
on the sapphire line it was on smaller
lines-and one or two bigger ones-that
real vigilance was needed

  going to ground us asked hof-
meyer

  what do you think any reason why
i should

  hofmeyer grinned and shook his head
turning to the bank of controls he was
a young captain hofmeyer perhaps too
young he hadnt had years as a subor-
dinate to give him stability there had
never been a blemish on his record which
was in a way unfortunate for him for
he had never had a chance to learn by his
own mistakes he was like a car driver
who had never been in a skid or an acci-
dent who had never seen death for him-
self or others if he could not pull up in
ten yards who had never known brakes
or steering or engine to fail when the
emergency came at last he might be able
to handle it nobody knew bremner hoped
he would bremner had seen hofmeyers
wife once or twice-a grand girl the kind
of girl hofmeyer with his invariable good
luck or good judgment would have mar-
ried

  mccall the second officer was of a
different stamp he was twenty years older
than hofmeyer very little younger than
bremner himself to mccall everything
hadgone wrong bremner knew the space-
safety margin



men he traveled with and these two as
well as any over thirty years since jim
mccall had been set to pass out of training
school with the best record ofhis year
then on his last month before grading
emergency had forced him into temporary
command of a ship in a dangerous situa-
tion it was tough luck on any trainee
he had not done badly and there was
every attempt to make allowance for him
but he could not be given top grading
and that was the pattern for the next
thirty years of his career he had mar-
ried at the same age as hofmeyer but
his wife had left him two years later

  strangely enough bremner knew of no
closer friendship than between the two
men other officers came and went but
no ship ever reached space with a berth
for one and not for the othec for ten
years in various capacities but always
some two steps apart they had traveled
space together

  the first officer came in with the as-
trogation correlates merson was a man
utterly without capacity for anger or ambi-
tion he had reached his position because
he had done well enough to be put there
if promotion were not in some measure
automatic merson would still be a space-
hand

 mr bremner said merson holding
out the calculations interrogatively he
hadnt known bremner long enough for
familiarity bremner nodded the papers
away

  theyve been checked i suppose he
said

  heredity should be all right mer-
son replied they come from a long line
of astrogators

  bremner grinned is that new or have
you cracked it before

  he nearly broke it on the run in
murmured hofmeyer

hofmeyer took the ship up

gently on the rockets then when it
was a thousand feet off the ground he
stabbed the vibrodrive and held it until
the bell rang bremner frowned ten
seconds coasting then the drive went on
again this time hofmeyer just missed
the bell but there could only have been

                      

a split second in it as if to show that
he could get closer than that the third
time hofmeyer got an instant more of
drive and still beat the bell then hof-
meyer switched to automatic and the ship
built up velocity in five-second bursts

 mr merson said bremner and
mr mccall id like to speak to the capt
tain for a moment

  they hesitated no single man could be
left in control-not even an engineer
two officers had to stay at control or
rarely one officer and the engineer
but they knew and hofmeyer knew what
bremner wanted hofmeyer had been ask-
ing for it and even bremner had to give
it to him mccall and merson went out
silently

  i know said hofmeyer cheerfully
but its safe you get a mind like a
chronometer after a bit-up to ten seconds
anyway ive never had less than two
seconds to spare

  sometimes said bremner carefully
a man can lose two seconds he can
remember something important hes for-
gotten someone can speak to him he can
lose his balance or get sudden cramp a
hundred things can happen to prevent him
touching a button until its too late

  but if he can lose two seconds he can
lose three

  its not just one and half times as
unlikely its far more than that hof-
meyer dont think im just making petti-
fogging objections you know what hap-
pens if the drives on too long chain
reaction easy to start and absolutely im-
possible to stop for a hundred years weve
been trying to find some safe way of de-
stroying the affected part so that even
if the drive was on too long it would be
possible to annihilate the whole mechanism
and the reaction with it it cant be done
we only spread the reaction more quickly
your trouble hofmeyer is that you know
no harm can result so long as the drive
is cut within  seconds you know it
doesnt matter as far as the safety of the
ship is concerned whether its two seconds
or  so like an experienced operator
in any other sphere you want to work
right to the limit but remember all the
unlikely things that cant be expected on


planet stories

one trip but might happen once in two
hundred the button sticks if youve left
three seconds youve time to cut out the
drive with the lever anything less and
thats the end of you and the ship
hofmeyer had sobered all right jeff
i know but in my own defense thats
the first time since i left training school
that i kept on drive until the bell rang
what i dont understand is why do they
leave it to human error why not make
it impossible for the drive to be kept on
more than nine seconds it would be easy
enough

  theres several reasons and the main
one is that every pilot would then rely
too much on the safety device he couldnt
help it hed know it no longer depended
on him another reason is that in the
end its safer to trust human beings in a
matter like this than machines clocks stop
relays wear wires break or lose their in-
sulation maybe you dont know it but
fifty years before you were bom the kind
of device you mention was tried out the
report was unfavorable the machine
didnt give the safety margin that a human
being knowing what could happen does
another thing-just for curiosity and
dont knock my head off if i should know
the answer why use a button that has
to be pushed twice wouldnt it be better
if it had to be held down then if the
captain suddenly dropped dead his finger
would come off the button

  theres more difference of opinion
about that the reason its as is is that
its supposed to be -quicker pressing down
than withdrawing pressure phsyiologi-
cally

  well isnt it 

  yes but theres also the fact that when
you press a button it has to go right in
and make contact before it has any effect
if youre taking your finger off contact
is broken from the instant the button is
allowed to move but thats not the sort
of thing thats likely to matter much the
main thing is simply that pilots must take
care

  all right jeff i suppose i needed that
are you going to report me

  not if i have your promise-a per-
sonal promise to me nothing to do with

the spacemans code-that youll take six
seconds as your mark

  its done i suppose though you wont
tell me about it that even the  figure
allows a certain margin of safety which
you boys are keeping to yourselves
its a reasonable assumption brem-
ner admitted but get this hofmeyer
dont go thinking its safe to wait for the
bell and then a bit the margins been
made as small as it reasonably can be-
for remember no one wants to waste the
drive you can call the others back now
merson and mccall showed their
quality by making no indication that they
knew their captain had been on the carpet
they were a good trio bremner thought

it went on being a nice trip right
to the moment when mccall had his
first suspicion of the astrogation correlates
merson and he were in the control-room
with the engineer at the time

  get them to run the whole thing again
merson suggested theyll swear at you
particularly when the same figures come
out again but astrogators have things
too easy anyway

  mccall looked at bremner for permis-
sion to leave only the two of them in
control the engineer nodded he wasnt
worried about the calculations he had
been in space a long time and he could
see nothing wrong with the course they
were cutting close to the sun to inter-
cept the orbit of venus but they were
at full velocity and looked as if they
could be a lot closer without having to
worry

 mccall was gone a long time he
brought hofmeyer back with him merson
and the engineer looked up disturbed
now

  i dont know whether we can get
clear said mccall grimly but were
going to have to try

  he explained what had happened in
detail a junior astrogator had run the
calculation it had looked all right to
the second astrogation officer and he had
passed it to his chief the chief knew it
was passed by two good men and that it
was supposed to be checked by one of
the senior officers he looked at it did

 r
safety margin



a neat little calculation in his head and
was satisfied thinking the disagreement
was only what might be expected from
his approximations no more no less

  and i did the same said merson
probably got the same answer

  hofmeyer cut out the automatic drive
and eased the ship round-in six-second
bursts bremner noticed then he went
back to automatic he had done all he
could before they had worked out a new
course

  they all worked on it independently
the three officers and the engineer part
of the blame was his no authority said
he had to check astrogation correlates-
only that he should see that it was done
on perhaps fifty out of a hundred and
fifty or so trips long and short he had
worked the whole thing out painstakingly
without calculators he had never found
a tenth-place decimal mistake once he
thought he had and an astrogator con-
cealing his glee had demonstrated the
error in his mathematics

  hofmeyer consulted charts and passed
them on to the others he got his result
first and waited patiently while the others
completed their calculations

  they coincided exactly the ship was
too close to the sun already to turn it
further than hofmeyer had done would
give the sun a greater pull what they
wanted was more power to put into the
existing curve and they didnt have it
the vibrodrive could be operated to give
them over nine seconds at a time and
with a glance at the engineer hofmeyer
proceeded to do just that waiting delib-
erately each time after the bell rang for
what seemed an interminable time but
it was still not enough

  bremner looked at the three of them
leave me he said ill take over

  we cant hofmeyer remarked quietly

  an engineer had power of life and
death but no individual not even an
engineer could be left in sole control
bremner thought of argument but it
would take too long

  very well he said leave me with
mccall

  there was nothing to show the thought
behind that the fact that the instant be-

fore he spoke he had not known whether
he had been about to say hofmeyer mer-
son or mccall

merson and hofmeyer didnt argue
the engineer must have some plan
and the longer they waited the less likely
it would be to be effective silently they
left

  take over said bremner switch
on

  the drive was silent there were scores
of warning devices to show that it was on
but only the lights and buzzers and dials
showed it mccall watched them and
waited well over nine seconds space of-
ficers got so that they didnt need clocks
for anything up to ten seconds they
could feel when the drive had to go off
with increasing urgency as  approached
hofmeyer was good but in emergency
mccall was little behind him when he
moved his finger at least  seconds had
elapsed

  no exclaimed bremner leave it

  habit was too strong mccall cut the
drive as usual

  put it on and leave it said the
engineer

  mccall looked at him to make sure
he had not suddenly gone mad and did
as he was told

  theres a very big safety margin
then he murmured the drive went on
for ten seconds twenty seconds a min-
ute

  the whole thing is safety margin
said bremner its strange how easy it
is to get a white lie accepted as plain
truth theres one in psychology too-
know it everyone knows no one can be
hypnotized into doing something his con-
scious mind abhors-psychologists teach
it and its simply not true my theory
though i havent looked into history to
check it is that some early psychologist
janet or charcot maybe saw that hyp-
nosis was liable to be outlawed so he
invented that-safety margin if you like
everybody believed it because it was a
nice thing to believe and whenever it
occurred to anyone that there ought to
be strict control of hypnosis someone was
sure to say but no one can be hypnotized

into   and everyone relaxed

  you mean the vibrodrive can be used
   indefinitely mccall asked theres
no chain reaction his face showed the
effort it took to believe it if you believe
for forty years that petrol is inflammable
it is a shock when you learn at last that
petrol wont burn under any circumstances
but the ships that have been lost   
some of them never existed we cre-
ated them on paper as necessary remin-
ders the rest disappeared for other rea-
sons some of which we dont know but
it was convenient to put them all down
to the same cause we were grateful for
these losses in a way sooner or later
someone would realize that no one had
ever known a spaceman who was lost
if we relied solely on the paper losses
but when every loss was put down to
carelessness with the vibrodrive every
spaceman knew someone who had died
in a blowup

  but why

bremner was studying the dials on
the board youd only have to think
for a moment to see that the extra
power had done the job bremner sighed
the vibrodrive is the most terrible wea-
pon ever invented-if it can be used con-
tinuously and if theres no limit to the
power that can be put into it think of
it a fort could be made the armature
in a drive thats no drive it goes on and
on hour after hour and no one knows
anything about it until the fort itself be-
gins to spin or a directional drive can
be set to an area on a planet maybe a
thousand miles square the force isnt
strong enough to move a thing in the
area-but after a while storms disrupt it
and gales bring everything to a standstill
or if you really want to start something
you turn your drive on the sun or tune
it to a thought waveband you can stop
all radio communication kill thousands at
a time and theres no defense

  bremner fixed the second engineer with
a significant gaze and remember he

said softly that these are only the things
anyone can think of offhand without really
trying what uses could be discovered
for the vibrodrive as a weapon in war are
beyond all our imaginings

  so long ago scientists and govern-
ments got together they couldnt stop
or outlaw the drive too many people
knew too much about it by that time
all they could do was create a fairy story
that might save civilization until it knew
better they had to blow up a few ships
then sacrifices to the good of the greatest
number but they got this myth established
they fixed things so that anyone who
started experimenting with the idea that
there need be no chain reaction would
be betrayed at once not by high-minded
men who cared for the future of humanity
but by any man who wanted to keep his
own skin whole and its worked

  mccall darted a glance at him suddenly
uneasy but you must keep this secret
he muttered

  bremner smiled he answered the un-
spoken question obliquely i might get
you made an engineer he said softly
theres always that out

  mccall sighed with relief

  you can cut the drive now said
bremner

  it had been a hard decision hofmeyer
-careless lucky easy-going merson-re-
liable up to a point and then utterly ir-
responsible mccall-disappointed but not
soured trustworthy but not brilliant

  bremner watched mccall at the control
board and then suddenly moved mccall
slumped over the board and the engineer
put the little flat gun back in his pocket

  yes it had been a hard decision it
was hardly just that mccall should have
to die for the error of others partly brem-
ners own but life seldom was just he
moved to the door mccall would be
stated to have died from heart failure
and the doctors examination would show
just that

  hofmeyer-merson he called im
afraid something has happened to mc-
call

it

 y tis name was burton

  i t john r burton

m j he was as happy as anyone could
expect to be his wife loved him and he
loved his wife their children were very
pitell adjusted as zvas everyone of course
in the new world system

  burton worked ten hours a week in a
coal mine though the job was merely one
demanding the overseeing of machines
the rest of the uteek was one of leisure
devoted to gardening hobbies play music
there was no more hate no violence no
feelings of insecurity it wasnt that every-
one loved everyone else particularly it
was just that no one was afraid of the
future anymore

  sometimes though burton had bad
dreams sometimes they were very bad
in these dreams it seemed that he was
somebody else someone who-

  but after he woke up he never remem-
bered the dreams so he thought maybe
they didnt matter

  burton guessed that what he was in the
dreams was too horrible to remember

d anton sat in the chair before the
control bank and stared at his hands
until they seemed to stop shaking it had
been a long long way to mars a long
long time in which to think

  of for example who had he been for
the last hundred years he had been
someone someone with a name a job a
ritual a wife kids everything a valu-
able worker a nice round peg in one of
countless millions of nice round holes
who and what you had been for the past
hundred years was certainly a question
that could bother you he thought

  he glanced at keith and van ness
it wasnt bothering them now they had
been two other people for a century also
-but they werent bothered now they
had passed out cold on pre-new world
bourbon

  they had better snap out of it danton
thought a little desperately the ship had
about reached mars they had better get
up from there

  his hands started shaking again he
got a cigarette lighted and the opiate stuff
crawling in his throat he closed his eyes

stories

for an instant it felt better hiding in
there behind the darkness of his closed
lids but then the thoughts came faster
like schools of irritated fish

   a final war like the last one destructive
beyond memory anyway was one most of
the survivors had been more than happy
to forget they had welcomed recondi-
tioning the moving into the plan into
the new world system of non-violence
people became largely depending on the
amount of reconditioning necessary some-
one else you cant change solidly laid
foundations of thought and still be the
same person

  so it was a new world in it the peo-
ple were new everything starting over
again from scratch a small decentralized
population beneficent leaders masters of
psychology no weapons not even in
museums no conception of war no fears
of tomorrow there were no enemies on
earth in fact the mind was conditioned
so that the concept of an enemy was im-
possible outer space was merely a region
of lovely stars on clear nights

  of the few new system soldiers left
most were willing to be reconditioned
three of them hadnt been willing ri-
chard danton don keith dwight van
ness they had degenerated into drunken
pariahs people without a group with
which to identify themselves lonely lost
aging and ailing finally they did accept
reconditioning not because they wanted
to but because they had to or go com-
pletely insane seers secretary of social
security said this was bad but that they
might be able to bring about an adjust-
ment it would be difficult he said because
of involuntary conditioning but he would
see what he could do

   evidently he had done all right danton
couldnt remember the subsequent hundred
years but he had been someone they
had blotted him out fixed him up with
another name twisted ganglia altered syn-
apsis probed lobotomy here and there
everything went name identity the entire
business inside and out

  but all the time richard danton had
been there a pattern a circuit discon-
nected when they had needed him they
had merely twisted ganglia back altered

   r
martian nightmare



synapsis probed lobotomy again and af-
ter a hundred years here he was again
resurrected like a ghost and when they
were done with him after his assignment
was finished he would go back into the
grave and that someone else would go
on living

  but maybe not this time maybe not
again this could be a dangerous assign-
ment for him and keith and van ness
they might never get back to earth and
that might be all right-for them

  he would rather die fighting as a sol-
dier than keep on living as someone else
someone he didnt even know

  according to seers there was a chance
that the final war had not been quite so
final the oligarch council had evidently
escaped earth in secretly constructed space-
ships destined for mars if they had ac-
tually gotten to mars and had survived
they were there still and it would be only
a matter of time until they returned to
earth and destroyed it

  other factors made it even more com-
plicated earth couldnt defend itself for
one thing it had no weapons it had no
human being capable of manning a wea-
pon if it had one seers had said that the
sanity of the world depended on absolute
secrecy the population was never to
know anything at all never to suspect
that they might be threatened such know-
ledge seers said would destroy the new
system the people werent psychologi-
cally capable of receiving knowledge of
insecurity not for a long time yet

  but what bothered danton was-who
have i been for the last hundred years

keith was crawling across the floor
gasping at an oxygen inhalor the
small thin-faced and cynical soldier got
up and sat down he grinned are we
in valhalla yet captain

  you still take this whole thing as a
joke keith

  the psyche boys are good keith
said plenty good and i still say this
is just delusion theyre feeding us on
suggestion tape after good shots of hyp-
nosene

  why would they do that

  they tried to recondition us make

good little workers out of us but it didnt
take we dont remember sure-but thats
no sign we were successfully changed i
say we werent i got it all figured out
captain theyre killing us mercifully of
course making us die happy but were
dying just the same dying in a dream
a dream of soldiering of heroics of sac-
rifice and high honor just the way wed
want it and instead of waking up well
really die in the line of duty like a good
soldier should

 but-

  im not blaming them i think its a
fine idea for one thing we arent sure
its not really happening so well have
to accept it as truth its the real thing
any way you look at it danton saw
the grin fade slowly across the mask of
keiths face are we really here cap-
tain

  danton peered into the scope again
yes he whispered

  mars the god of war keith said
awaits his favorite sons

  a big dull reddish ball like an eye-
ball a blood-shot eye the cone of its
giant shadow streaming out a quadrant
of the heavens and then all at once
as if the eye were closing it darkened
except where the sun splattered down on
its far half a pool of sickly light radiating
outward into dissipating orange and brown

  danton thought of the oligarchs down
there or what remained of them the
oligarchs and the slaves they would have
brought with them in their ships in a
hundred years they could have multipled
considerably and the oligarchs them-
selves the last of the old world type of
faithless human madness - essentially
amoral no empathy tremendous egotism
-filled with the old ideas of class su-
periority they destroyed with utter cas-
ualness what advanced stage had their
paranoid culture reached in a century it
wasnt something one wanted to think
about

  the planet was reaching up like a
clenched red fist he felt the impulse to
duck sweat ran down his face itched
along his ribs a hundred years was a
long time to be someone else and now
danton was wondering if he dared trust
	planet

himself anymore as a soldier his hands
moved again over the controls

  the wrecked oligarch ship had been
found off the mindanao deeps by a sub-
sea exploring party brought up recon-
ditioned studied there were records and
documents in it and from these seers
made his decision he brought back dan-
ton in secret of course send them to
out of living graves they were trained
made into astrogators cosmologists every-
thing in absolute secrecy of course and
after the ship blasted off for mars only
the three of them and seers retained
any knowledge that there had been a ship
at all the reconditioners had fixed that
up those who had found it the scien-
tists who had studied it no one remem-
bered a thing

  find out what you can then come
back seers had said dont fight if
you fight you might never come back
we would never know then what to do
we can prepare ships like this one dan-
ton in secret of course send them to
mars but we dont want to take a chance
like that unless we have to if activity
like that ever leaked out to the people
that would be the end of the new sys-
tem a sudden blast of insecurity would
wreck our delicately balanced new or-
der

  it was a fine ship danton thought
the oligarchs knew machines they wor-
shiped them the ship was also a mon-
strous arsenal a hurtling fountain of de-
struction loaded with hydrogen bombs
and something called a proton cannon
that could curl a planet up in space like
a moth in a flame

  power death throbbing around him
hot and terrible    the ordnance console
key inches from his fingertips keith had
said he didnt want to go back to earth
not and face all that business again why
not let go blast die right here when
the attack came  that was a soldiers way

  im going to throw her into an orbit
danton said

  he saw the weird swirling light of the
moons then the moons of mars as the
ship slowed in its orbit heavy cloud-
banks drifting low in colossal valleys
and then he saw the ships three of

stories

them rising like giant silver beetles

he didnt know whether he de-
liberately bungled and failed to lift
the ship out of its orbit in time or whe-
ther - but psychologically there werent
such things as accidental blunders any-
way now it was too late maybe every-
one on earth would be wiped out because
of it but danton blundered moved too
slowly from the ships a white cloud of
released energy flashed blinded billowed
his ship bucked and swerved and lurched

  keith whispered tensely ill take that
ordnance captain ill take it

  van ness weaved upright sucking at
an oxygen capsule murhbling

  danton said theyre not firing now
theyre curious maybe let them get in
close theyll come in try to identify us
it must have just occurred to them that
this is one of their old ships then we
fire clear our course and run

  run run get your gun van ness
mumbled

  danton swung the view-plate the ships
hovered behind slightly above coasting
waiting watching danton laughed aloud
for a hundred years he had been dead
now he was alive really alive his fingers
were hot and wet as he gripped the t-bar
and he saw that the ships were improved
types he couldnt escape back to earth
now even if he wanted to and he didnt
have time now to figure out whether he
wanted to or not it was too late now
for thinking he preferred it that way
he said theyre coming in close now
keith this is it

  keith nestled into the ordnance chair
like a bird his body was tight with anti-
cipated pleasure his fingers hooked
spread began to tremble individually
death was there all around

  without looking up seemingly without
reason he asked you were engaged to
marry a very pretty girl when the war
ended werent you captain someone
named mara

  danton hadnt forgotten thats right
i couldnt explain it to her-why i wouldnt
be reconditioned she married someone
else a cybernetics engineer named
george
martian nightmare



  the hell with them all of them keith
said you wouldnt want to go back
there thats what they all think about
us captain while they need us were
great guys and afterwards-dont touch
no captain whether this is delusion or
the real thing this is how we were meant
to go were lucky captain

  keith manipulated the ordnance keys
dantons eyes went blind before the in-
credible flash of kinetic energy release
his eyes closed music lifting whirling
round and round and he was rocking
with gentle joyous softness in a cradle of
death   

  but danton got his hands up against
the darkness held on to it pushed it this
way and that got it away from his eyes
he crawled back into the chair blinked
into the viewer he didnt see the ships
now anywhere only the great clenched
fist of the war-world the red world rush-
ing up growing with a silent onrushing
fury looming broadening

  keiths fingers dug into dantons shoul-
der i got em captain burned them
out like ants on a hot plate they burned
so beautiful   

  the ship had suffered from the reper-
cussion nothing responded right danton
shoved more intensifier units into the stem
tubes straightened her a little with a cou-
ple of bursts from the steering jets then
power-dived with the tubes roaring

  he fought the controls the numbness
the roaring the intolerable rising tempera-
ture of the walls fighting for some sort
of balance to get the ship hurtling in at
least a low-level orbit the walls quivered
then the whining sighing falling through
a dense sea of twisting vapor

  danton watched the altimeter the power
gauges manipulated the power-tube stops
his body was an unfeeling unconscious
circuit of responses somehow he got the
ship at vertical the plate brought the
landscape up to him presented it to him
like the unveiling work of a mad artist
up-pushing violence of mountain walls a
valley forest dense alien looking stuff
thick and high and entangled and phos-
phorescent with a pinkish glow drifting
like the reflection of a vast roaring fur-
nace

  and-a senseless glimpse of something
archaic too primitive to be real only a
glimpse so that immediately after he de-
cided he must have seen something else
a long trail of armored cars amtracs it
seemed bristling with ancient types of
guns armored cars amtracs a few hun-
dred years ago they had had them in
earth museums

  the ship roared and shook the scream
of metal penetrated dantons skull be-
came part of an iron ball grinding in
his head   

  no sentience possessed him now no
mind no body no hate or joy orhope
or confused indecision about his twisted
motivations he thought simply death pos-
sesses me

but death was only nearby life
was a powertube dimming to a dull
yellow flickering dangerously movement
was without real substance shapes voices
vague and distant he heard van ness
and keith talking once someone yelled
there was the burning sigh of the elec-
tronic rifles they had evidently been able
to salvage

  the light brightened slowly he sat up
keith and van ness stood beside him
clothing torn faces scratched and bleed-
ing keiths mouth was tight his jaw mus-
cles rigid and pale he turned held his
rifle steady van ness wanted to know if
danton felt all right now anything else
wrong besides the knock on the head

  danton said he didnt know i thought
it would be cold here he was sweating
the air was muggy quiet the lake was
huge before him the mountains beyond it
gigantic and blue-misted the lake was
glassy and still behind him was thick
forest reddish leaves high trees thickly
entangled odd flowers shadows a feel-
ing of things alive-but of a cautious kind
of living little eyes waiting and watching
in the bushes on the fringes

out of this valley on the desert it
would be plenty cold keith said
danton asked then what happened
keith watched the forest warily we
hit the lake out there had to swim in
so now what van ness wanted to
know


pimet stories

we still have a kind of advantage
danton said they dont know who we
are or where they know nothing
neither do we keith said theres
a chance seers was wrong about the oli-
garchs maybe their culture has changed
maybe they dont intend to attack earth
their ego couldnt stand to forget their
defeat danton said they had a highly
advanced technology that could conceiv-
ably control any environment rather than
the other way round in some ways they
were ahead of the rest of the world
keith grinned thats right captain
youre-so right

  danton looked keith in the eyes you
mentioned earlier something about some-
times thinking you should be an oligarch
you really feel that way keith

  why not we didnt have a choice
whose side we would fight on we were
conditioned from the time we were old
enough to think and we fought the oli-
garchs for fifty years three-quarters of
the worlds population rubbed out and
then we had a world that didnt want us
-unless we were three other people we
fought to destroy the old values help build
a new society but lets face it captain-
those old values we destroyed were our
own we helped destroy our own kind of
world so what does it mean it means
we should have fought for the oligarchs
and that we really sympathize with them
their system is a war system probably
still is with them there would always
be a place for a fighting man a soldier
among the oligarchs could expect honor
and privilege

danton had nothing to say he had
thought in a similar way more than once

  van ness said wrong keith weve
committed ourselves and now we have to
go on to the end of the road

  the words drifted with the wind across
the glassy lake you walked along the
road danton thought while the road was
visible and you walked it to the end and
neither road nor the end was your own
choice maybe the only glory was in walk-
ing it bravely but maybe as keith had
said they had been on the wrong road
the oligarchs had they conquered would
have always provided an honorable place

for a soldier banners flags women the
rise of battle fever the ecstatic explosions
of power the enemy dead

  keith fired once into the forest wall
a shape fluttered away over the tops of
the trees then fell crying at first then
screaming like a woman weve been fol-
lowed by those things for about a mile
along the shore edge keith said they
dont seem friendly theyre intelligent
big with wings and old-style weapons
very old explosive powder stuff
martians said van ness

danton said i caught a look at
some human beings just before we
hit the lake maybe i was seeing things
that werent but there seemed to be an-
cient amtracs old-style cannon marching
men

  keith nodded this whole business is
crazy a highly advanced technology with
spaceships in the air-and centuries-old
amtracs and gun-powder on the ground
if this is all a dream and were really on
earth in a psyche-cell somebodys got a
devil of an imagination

an explosion then the whine of steel
missiles sent the three on their stomachs
among the small sharp shells danton
raked the forest with flash-gun fire
finally danton said we have to move
without a plan of action  keith said
no our plan is the same find out
all we can and return to earth seers has
to know he doesnt want to prepare a
secret attack unit to send up here unless
hes absolutely sure its necessary

  even if we live long enough to find
out something how do we get back to
earth by teleportation

 well have to get a ship or try dan-
ton said

  the sound of explosions drifted to
them the flat reverberating roar of bombs
van ness looked to the right and said
that way and not so far either

	 

  ten miles from the lake the three
crawled into the dense brush beside the
trail they could hear now the approach
of laboring gasoline motors the shouts
of men danton waited he waited tensely

r
martian nightmare



as though somewhere inside of him was
a knowledge of what he waited for

  the moons moved across the high val-
ley the light was clear still with a
reddish cast purple shadows bent and
swayed in the slight and cooler wind
through the odd light a column of wheez-
ing amtracs came broad wheels grinding
coughing engines voices murmuring bod-
ies wearily slogging humans weary
ghosts

  van ness whispered looks as though
theyre in retreat

  danton nodded van ness said the
ounded the dead and the dying i guess
you could say weve come home again

  danton slowly licked his lips the fifty-
years war against the oligarchs hadnt
been like this his war had been swift
and clean and shiny as the metal cities
that went with the bright hot flames of
atomic fission now the smells of sweat-
ing men drifted to him the smell of blood
and of death

  weary white-faced shabbily-uniformed
men filing by many hobbled wounded
swinging along in a freakish dance crude
stretchers carrying others somewhat re-
sentfully amtracs hauled still others
some wounded others dying some already
dead the sounds of bombardment edged
nearer through the moonlight the column
moved faster and danton noticed then
that the women were there uniformed
hardly distinguishable from the men

  the ground jarred projectiles screamed
an amtrac rose up in a blossoming cone
fell apart metal shining and bodies dis-
integrating a small detachment swung in
squarely toward dantons position the
three men faded back into deeper con-
cealment

  a tired thickly-bearded line-officer
barked an order thomas rennin take
the bodies away at once according to
the map theres a disposal mart half a
mile east

  the torn bodies were rolled onto
stretchers and carried into the shadows

  danton thought some pestilence prob-
ably they have to get rid of the bodies
fast but why under the stress of imme-
diate attack

  the line-officer was saying men

weve been under constant attack for
eighty-five days our survival depends on
orderly retreat until we combine forces
with rudolphs second army

  a woman stopped walking her face was
streaked with dirt she yelled why
doesnt the power give us some real wea-
pons with a real power gun we could
kill every redbird that-

  the line-officer brought his revolver up
fired the back of the womans head ex-
ploded as the flattened bullet came out
the officers face twitched barrows se-
lect a man take her to the disposal mart
yes sir

  after the body was gone danton stared
dazedly at the spot where the woman had
fallen the officer was saying any ref-
erence to the powers other than that ne-
cessitated by duty and reverence is pun-
ished immediately by execution then
the officer sat down and looked blankly
into the moonlight that was a quotation
from a manual danton thought but the
officer-hadnt meant it he hadnt wanted
to shoot the woman that might be very
important to consider

  presently the officer stood up men
the redbirds will follow up this bom-
bardment with a winged attack they al-
ways do when the moons are right well
remain hidden along the trail and take
them as they come in theyve never
learned the strategy of ambush make
ready for the attack be alert

danton motioned and the three
of them retreated slowly as silently
as possible they had crawled probably a
hundred yards when the attack came

  the redbirds were red they also
might be considered birds with a reptilian
dominance their wingspread was enor-
mous and their bodies were very nearly
human to look at-with an alien deviation
that made them seem grotesque when they
really werent grotesque at all in a way
they were beautiful red feathers -and
gold-flecked eyes

  and then the air was torn apart explo-
sions rushing bodies breaking wings
burning feathers and singeing flesh and
hissing screams the moonlight fluttered
with winged shadows
planet stories



  this is real war danton heard van
ness yell hand to hand the real
thing

  danton couldnt see either van ness
or keith he fought firing wildly at sha-
dows and substance the real thing it
was strange he thought but in that fifty
years of the bloodiest war the most de-
structive in history-hed never killed any-
thing hand to hands it had been coldly
impersonal that war a million here a
million there nine million at once and
nothing remaining except charred craters
no bodies around no one crying either
nothing at all but this-

  van nesss fading scream chopped
down like hot steel danton couldnt fire
afraid of burning van ness who was
being lifted up by a redbird van ness
was gone almost before danton realized
that he was being carried up and away
over the tree tops

  danton crawled around in the flame-
blasted clearing his rifle was gone the
redbirds powerful wings had slammed it
into shadows and brush he looked for
keith

  keith

  he didnt find keith either

  he lay still very still several soldiers
were poking around in the tangled debris
of bodies and blood and torn brush it
was so still all at once no sounds at
all except the hard breathing of men no
wings threshing or screams penetrating

  danton played dead he was surprised
at how easy it was

  he recognized the officers voice load
everything that looks human in a couple
of amtracs and drag them to the disposal
mart

  yes sir

  motors idling men lifting and grunting
and cursing danton opened his eyes just
a little stared upward into the broad river
of sky far up between the mountains-
how many casualties

  not bad we lost a quarter maybe
we probably burned down a thousand
redbirds

  where do they all come from well
never kill them all they keep coming and
theyll always keep coming

  theyre supposed to come from across

the white desert well never find out
anyone striking out across that desert
never comes back

  the officer on the double men
  why does it go on

 who knows

  will we win

  no one can win the redbirds will
keep coming we keep killing

  the powers are happy though fifty
bodies to the marts counting yesterdays
casualties thats over three hundred to the
marts since this battle started

  and how many since the war started 
who knows  when wasnt there a war
pal  what the hell would a guy do around
here if there wasnt a war on

  danton felt hands on his ankles and
wrists he forced limpness down his body
and felt himself tossed among the dead
he was hardly noticed at all dead or
otherwise his uniform was tom covered
with blood and dirt until it looked like
any other uniform he must look pretty
bad to be taken for dead

  swarms of insects drawn by the blood
settled in clouds the amtrac jerked for-
ward danton saw the drivers sitting up
there like gray plaster figurines one o
the men started to mumble a song a kind
of chant more like a dirge

  shut up youll get us shot
borkans back there he cant hear
danton listened his stomach went hol-
low and icy at the song it was old it
was full of ghosts ghost treads and ghost
shadows marching out of the past out of
the present

    the men of the tattered battalion
      which fights till it stumbles and dies

    dazed with the scream of the battle
      the din and damned glare and the
      cries

    the men with the broken heads back-
      ward and the blood running out of
      their eyes i

  shut up

    the pozvers have all of the music
      the glory and color and gold

     ours be a handful of ashes a bounti-
       ful mouthful of mould

  r
martian nightmare



  shut up i tell you well be shot if
you-

    of the maimed of the halt and the
    blind in the rain and the cold-

  the song faded slowly died out it
seemed to die of weariness to ran down
and danton kept on hearing it-circling
mournfully through his head like swirling
muddy water round a stake

  one thing he was seeing now graphi-
cally so that he would never forget wars
werent all the same sometimes fighting
men hated war he had known only the
swift clean war the septic war a gigantic
street-cleaning machine with a ray gun in
front and a rotary brush in the back with
individuals turned abruptly into the earth
from which they had come and no one
knowing the difference

  but in different times and places wars
could be different

he amtrac stopped lets
get em out of here

  danton was thrown up over out and
down and other forms fell around him
he heard a moan from something not
quite dead metal clanged machinery
whirred he thought of the mart disposal
mart he thought of dropping through a
hole maybe into a pit of fire or into a
vat of something all through him as
from an intravenous injection-horror

  he looked a mound of metal as
though a bald giant had been buried up
to his eyebrows metal corroded with
green slime and there an opening ap-
pearing as heavy metal doors slid open
a rail-car with a spherical truck bed
emerging from the opening and waiting
with an eery suggestion of eager sentience
in its cold metal

  the men throwing the bodies into the
railcar

  what happens to them

  who knows no one ever hears of
them again morlan mentioned it the other
day he said the powers demand sacri-
fice like gods maybe im not superstitious
or anything but-

  why not somethings taking care of
us making us move around dance on

the invisible wires maybe the powers are
gods why not theyre supposed to jive
forever never grow old

  push the button push it get them
out of here wait heres another one

  danton felt himself plunging striking
rolling among the other dead logs he
didnt move some of the horror was
dissolving because this whole disposal
system was too elaborate there was some-
thing basic and symptomatic about it and
danton felt that it was a key van ness
and keith were gone he couldnt think
about them now their disappearance had
seemed so very final he was alone he
still had his duty and he was curious
he wanted to find out what he could al-
though the idea of somehow getting a
ship and returning to earth with what
information he could gamer was no longer
part of his thoughts you could take ad-
vantage of the impossible if it happened
perhaps you couldnt anticipate it as a
basis for action

  but he was still curious and that was
part of his duty the oligarchs the
powers seemed interested in gathering in
the blossoms of death from the fields
very interested one of these soldiers had
said the powers would be happy surely
then the bodies wouldnt simply go into a
vat or a flame

  here she goes

  darkness silent movement whirring
rapidly accelerating speed hot wind sigh-
ing dry past his face the body of the
dead girl her body tight up against him in
the darkness moved a little she sighed
brokenly

  danton felt around found the belt hol-
ster ancient revolver he had spotted
earlier he removed it buckled it around
his own waist he was careful not to
raise his head above him close he felt
a ceiling rushing back

  feeling the girl beside him the girl
soldier still alive somehow he thought of
mara who had found him unbearable be-
cause he still had the mind of a soldier
and had refused to be reconditioned she
had grown to hate him-no not hate re-
vulsion it was natural she had been re-
conditioned to hate anything suggesting
violence

  well that was long ago and far away
further away than long ago

  the car slowed tilted doors slid open
and a soft blue radiance filtered through
danton clung to the metal and stared down
a gleaming metal chute he began to hear
incoherent sounds coming out of his own
throat uncontrollably as the car tilted fur-
ther he grabbed desperately hung on as
the car dumped its load into the chute
down down into a giant pit the pit was
surrounded with high mesh walls and a
steel rail and behind the rail a circular
walkway with panels or doors spaced at
regular intervals maybe a hundred or
more doors

  and cranes cranes lifting metal mouths
full of the squirming mass in the pit
lifting them to the railing and onto mov-
ing belts that carried them through the
walls and out of sight

 to what god to what danton
thought

danton clung frantically to the
empty car sweat made a stream
down his chest though the pit was re-
frigerated cold the metal was frosted
it shone like ice and in the pit some of
the bodies moved and made sounds the
girl soldier she got to her knees

  danton tried to crawl back back up
the slippery metal of the railcar he
sought darkness back there a place to
hide then he stopped trying and felt
his fingers loosening as he watched the
girl her face was unrecognizable behind
a mask of blood and dirt but she was
standing up now she raised one hand
she looked up at the many expressionless
doors

  the strength with which she forced the
keening death-song from her body was
not the strength of her body it came
from someplace else from outside from
memory from a last defiance that could
no longer suffer punishment from the
buried ghosts of thousands of years that
had died

    you sing of the great clem guns
      that belch forth death at will

     oh but the wailing mothers the life-
       less forms and still

   dantons hands let go and he slid down
the chute

        sing the songs of the billowing
       flags the bugles that cry before

   oh but the skeletons flapping rags
      the lips that speak no more

   he scarcely felt the bodies under him
he looked at the woman singing and he
listened

    sing the clash of bayonets and
      sabres that flash and hew

   will you sing of maimed ones too
      who die and die anew

   danton stumbled he reached her side

   sing of feted generals who bring
      the victory home

   oh    but the broken bodies that
      drip like honey-comb

   danton touched her shoulder her uni-
form hung in tatters a line of red ran
down her torn arm she sank to her knees
he could barely hear the last two lines
of her song

    sing of hearts triumphant
     long ranks of marching men

   and zirill you sing of the shadowy
      hosts that never march again

   he lifted her and stood holding her like
a child now her eyes were closed she
would have a pretty face he thought the
army uniform cap fell away and her hair
tumbled down over his hand and arm
like red dust her lips moved she whis-
pered no one hears no one - ever
hears

   i hear you danton said

   but you dont hear me he thought her
body was limp shes dead he thought

   the crane dipped steel jaws champing
steel-thewed neck stiff and superior now
lifting

  danton put the girl down leaped
caught the metal lips clung as the crane
lifted swung caught the rail pulled him-
self over onto the walkway his breath

r
martian nightmare



was hot and his lungs burned

  he slid the ancient revolver free and
examined it quickly its mechanism was
simple enough he twirled the cylinder
removed the safety catch doors where
did they go none of the doors seemed
inclined to tell him nothing moved around
him except the crane-and the conveyor
belt

  he walked round the circular way once
came back it would seem that he must
crawl onto the belt to escape the pit that
would take him-somewhere it seemed
that he was destined to follow the dead
wherever the dead went in this place
where the dead seemed to have lost the
last faint tinge of dignity or honor

  silently simultaneously the doors slid
open a man was bom from the darkness
of each black rectangle bronze giant men
in tunics that glittered like finely woven
metallic silk there was some variation
yet they were amazingly alike expression-
less cold removed far removed

  danton heard the conveyor belt moving
softly swiftly behind him carrying its
macabre load the revolver felt heavy in
his hand then from somewhere a voice
crackled in the pit like ice shifting

  bring this soldier to the council
room

  a mans voice without any particular
characteristic other than one of detach-
ment it might have been the voice of a
machine or something on a tape

  danton fired seven times after that he
stopped because the gun was empty of
cartridges each time he fired a man fell
soundlessly without dramatics calmly
each time the man next in line stepped
forward to receive the next bullet after
the last bullet was gone three other men
lifted the fallen bodies and placed them
on the conveyor belt five others sur-
rounded danton they did not touch him
if the episode had had any emotional sig-
nificance at all for these men danton
hadnt seen it further resistance was fu-
tile the firing of the revolver had been
only token defiance anyway

  danton felt the refrigerated air of the
pit clinging to him as the men marched
him down a long tubular hall walled in
dull metal

the room was large metal-vaulted
brittle mesh grid screens surrounded
him at a distance and the useless revolver
hung cold and damp in his hands three
men and three women sat behind a half-
moon of bright silver suspended from the
high ceiling by shimmering strands of sil-
ver like very fine wire

  as architecture the things he had seen
were the final stage in constructivism an
elimination of the sense of weight and
solidity of traditional forms everywhere
were space constructions of metal sheets
glass plastic beams of angular light
some vaguely related to human figures
largely as abstracts of geometrical shapes
technological forms

  environment and people were each a
balanced projection of the other the gen-
eral effect was one of machine-like pre-
cision brittle coldness in which man and
machine had reached emotionless synthe-
sis

  one of the men said rhone will you
question this

  the womans voice was musical but
without warmth like a nicely constructed
music-box what is your name

  he did not answer

  you should answer soldier volun-
tarily i can assure you that we have ways
to force your mind to give up all of its
secrets

  she waited he did not answer

  your actions have been peculiar sol-
dier we are interested

  danton thought fast they had space-
ships three of them he had seen the
three they no longer had thanks to keith
if he admitted being from earth it would
certainly incite immediate reprisal and
seers wasnt ready he wouldnt be ready
for a long time he would never be ready
to receive an attack from mars his idea
was to send a secret force to attack mars
so that the new world populace would
never know about it

  a well-planned series of lies elaborate
complex provoking find out facts try
to postpone or avert any immediate attack
on earth reduce things to as individual
a level as possible he had one advantage
from his observations to this point the
oligarch culture seemed not to have


planet stories

changed its basic pattern evolution had
merely moved that pattern forward a hun-
dred years solidified its static essence
cold efficiency egomania class superiority
-the system supported by scientific me-
thod and a fanatical one-track dogma
based on paranoia

  he had fought this force a long time
he thought he understood it

  your name soldier your unit and
rank

  danton west he said he remem-
bered the line-officers words a quick
frame of reference captain second
army that was a while back more
lately of the revolutionary forces
revolutionary-

  danton saw their expressions alter al-
most imperceptibly but alter they did
under the masks when that fifty-years
war had ended none of the central ruling
clique the oligarch council had been
found and one thing seemed incredible
to danton as he stood there

  these three men and women seemed
to be the same individuals who had made
up that oligarch council on earth a hun-
dred years before

  that was logical enough except-
they hadnt aged at all there had been
no sign of change

  that soldier back there had said 
theyre supposed to live forever they
never grow old

  that is impossible of course the wo-
man rhone said now-explain your uni-
form it is unorthodox in fact it is a
duplication of the uniforms worn by offi-
cers of a certain army of another time
and place of which you should know noth-
ing can you explain this

  i can and will we do know about
those certain armies in another time and
place a hundred years ago earth you
think we have forgotten

silence the womans eyes widened
only slightly though a tremendous in-
ner emotional surge was obvious one of
the men leaned forward danton was re-
lieved he felt a bit more secure seeing
even this slight degree of individuality
and emotion there was the psychological
effect he knew oftfeeling a subtle lessen-

ing of the unification of forces against
him

  they hadnt aged he thought the same
ones without grayness without wrinkles
without any sign of physical degeneration

  the woman said not to him voicing
her thoughts impossible no one beyond
the walls can possibly know of the past
we took great pains to assure that-mars
is the only world they have ever known
the only world that ever was our world

  we know danton said others know
too the revolutionists know im telling
you this much because nothing you can
do can stop it its developed too far re-
volt did yon think it would ever be
stamped out

  beneath the masks danton could see
concern incredulous concern maybe they
had thought they had set up an impervious
regime and maybe they actually had but
there was doubt here just enough of a
doubt to play upon one thing he knew
and that was that there was resentment out
there beyond the walls whatever the
walls were and those songs hopeless as
they were had been songs of revolt against
oppression the germ was out there   

  you have a choice the woman said
tell us everything you know that or
suffer the kind of pain we cannot describe
to you a kind you will find out for your-
self

  he could imagine the oligarchs had
been efficient at everything that had been
their god-efficiency mastery of the ma-
chines the maintenance forever of the
master-elite over the rabble

  like an amoeba the social forces of
the world had split the old values solidi-
fying the new values pulling away com-
ing back again overrunning defeating
but the oligarchs had fled and here they
had developed their particular systems to
some final state

  whatever they had waiting for him to
open his mind it would be efficient

  she said you entered our walls vol-
untarily why

  she said it as though it were totally in-
conceivable that anyone beyond the walls
should seek to enter voluntarily maybe it
was inconceivable

  curiosity danton said he managed

r
martian nightmare



to smile at each of them in turn there
have been so many rumors growing old
becoming legends and myths i came in to
find out for myself

  you do not expect to escape
danton shrugged i dont care one way
or the other i had hoped to remain here
he waited he thought finally he added
i had hoped to become one of you
what one of the men said in a whis-
per

  the man on rhones right said a
curious type obviously he has insight
one might almost think-

  the woman said we can speculate
later if we have to weisser right now
we are interested in facts facts

  she kept looking into dantons eyes
her own eyes had a curious green quality
she was beautiful of course physically
no one had ever denied the physical beauty
of the oligarchs hereditary physical
beauty was important to them they de-
veloped it by selective breeding and-no
one had figured out by what other means

  there was the indication of an edge to
the womans voice now three of our
ships vanished do you know anything
about those ships soldier

  danton smiled yes he said and
paused for perhaps five seconds we de-
stroyed them

  the silence then was longer than five
seconds it was very long it lengthened
until it was painfully heavy the womans
voice was a whisper how could the rab-
ble do that it isnt true of course it
couldnt be true

  youll never find the ships danton
said there arent any ships now we
blew them to pieces our scientists did it
i dont know where the scientists and their
secret laboratories are i dont know too
much about the inner workings of the re-
volt but i know some things you might
find very valuable

  but weisser it is impossible isnt it
of course the man is obviously lying
they couldnt possibly have evolved any
such weapon they couldnt even have de-
veloped the concept of revolt their cul-
tural patterns their attitudes and heredi-
tary capabilities are set they cant
change

then how do we classify this soldier
why bother some sort of crazy de-
viant we put him under the scanners
now then dispose of him his body has
ome value

  the woman said there still remains
the question of what happened to our
ships

  danton thought the oligarch council
operates on a strictly top-down principle
who is the extreme top the woman
rhone or the man weisser one of
them certainly that might be important
to know

  danton dipped into the small supply
packet at his waist lifted a food-capsule
to his mouth he looked first at weisser
then at the woman i can tell you a lot
and if you dont find out what is happen-
ing out there very soon youll be de-
stroyed like those ships ill bargain with
you let me remain here enjoy certain
privileges ive thought about often when
i was crawling around out there in the
mud show me what you have here let
me understand for that ill give you
valuable information you need to survive
weisser said coldly ive - bargain
with a mongrel

  this capsule is poison and it isnt par-
tial to blue-blood danton said easily a
few seconds after putting it into my
mouth ill be dead ill be silent then i
can tell you how the ships were destroyed
the weapons used some things about the
planned revolt if i dont tell you youll
never find out and if you dont find out
what is happening out there in a short
time it will be too late-for you

  the woman pointed take that door
out soldier perhaps youll be contacted
later

danton smiled dont wait too long
you dont have much time beautiful

a corridor led into a circular
room one section paneled entirely
in glass furnishings were suspended at
odd angles the concepts of an odd struc-
tural art from various lengths of silver
strands he stood there then tried the
door he couldnt open it he was locked
in he felt eyes on him

later he turned moved back until he
	planet stories

was facing the door through which he had
entered he kept the food capsule near
his mouth as the door opened and she stood
there looking at him strangely

  then she strode toward him long slim
legs and an easy imperious stride the
metallic-silk skirt that came half-way to
her knees tinkled like a -thousand infin-
itely tiny bells

  she said the records have been
checked one of our ships failed to get
out of earths atmosphere when we came
here a century ago we had assumed the
ship had burned up it has been suggested
that you are from earth that you found
that ship it would be odd if you were
one of the equalitarian soldiers who
fought against us a hundred years ago
danton shrugged self control was dif-
ficult now he had to resist an urge to
reach out put his fingers around her
throat she seemed weaponless and it
could be accomplished rapidly enough
there would be a great deal of personal
satisfaction but he still clung to the
shreds of his duty his duty to seers to
earth millions who could so easily die
under the bombs of an enemy they had
never been allowed to know even existed
or was that the real reason maybe i
dont really want to kill her

  think whatever you wish ive told you
the facts i know nothing about such a
ship if you believe such a fantastic idea
then where is this ship now

  youll answer that she said she
moved nearer nearer than necessary for
conversation how ageless and smooth her
face was he thought smooth and pale
and her eyes like exotic books conceal-
ing strange and terrible secrets

  he shrugged again it doesnt matter
much to me he said my offer still
stands take it or leave it as i said this
capsule will kill me in seconds after that
the troubles are all yours you wont be
able to escape those mongrels out there
as you call them they dont need earth
they have minds of their own

thats impossible theyre mongrels
you think you have them set solidly
and forever in a static mould just the way
you want them the perfect slavery-cul-
turally molded so they dont even realize

theyre slaves thats the idea it isnt
working out that way theyre human
with minds too complex-they can never
be wholly predictable of course you could
send an agent to earth to find out it
would reduce the odds against us

  us but youve asked to become one
of the oligarchs

  yes i would prefer that frankly but
it isnt too important im interested in
your system for only one reason-because
you never grow old you will notice that
i am growing old hair graying wrinkles
creeping in around my eyes i dont like
that to be ageless like you i would bar-
gain

  you seem so sure of yourself i almost
believe you

  i am sure of myself the mongrels
can manage a successful revolt but with
the information i can give you you could
put down that revolt i cant say about the
next revolt or the one after that or any
of the revolts that will go on as long as
there are men who have minds for figuring
out reasons for revolting if you try to
force the information from me ill take
the poison

  would you really do that

  he nodded

  we could go out there and get the infor-
mation directly from the mongrels
from them you would find out nothing
the mongrels dont know anything only
the leaders know the scientists the secret
underground you would never find them
the revolt is latent in every man beyond
these walls in every man and woman and
child the leaders know how to bring out
that latent desire to revolt when the time
comes there will be adequate weapons
too like the ones those three ships were
blasted with

  he touched her throat he felt the stir-
ring of the pulse a flush rose to her
cheeks show me why you havent grown
old during this last hundred years rhone
as i have

  her face was near his he could see
the trembling in her lips the enigmatic
brightness of her eyes youre attractive
she whispered and thats odd that a
mongrel could be attractive

  there are differences among the mon-

martian nightmare	

grels danton said he moved his hands
down her arms she shivered a little and
maybe theres a need in you that makes
me seem something im not

  that may be yes maybe it isnt so
easy to live forever we have all you
would think anyone would want here but
there are so few of us and the men-
always the same with faces the same and
walks the same and-

  then you really are the same rhone
the oligarch of a century ago

  yes

  and its true you never grow old
its true we wont grow any older
and well never die

  she looked into his eyes and the seconds
went by and time dissolved around dan-
ton and he thought the lies i have told
here-are they really a conscious effort
to deceive  do i really want uncon-
sciously to become an oligarch why
not he had wondered about it before
immortality a system depending on eter-
nal warfare for its existence was this
not his system after all

  come she said and took his arm
ill show you you interest me youre
a diversion soldier ill show you what
we are

they sat in a small spherical car
it made no noise it slid silently
over the smooth floor by working a simple
lever around it darted like a silver beetle
first she took him back to a place he re-
membered well the pit

  she didnt seem to see things actually
she talked with a calm detachment and
sometimes her thoughts seemed far away
dantons thoughts werent far away

  she was saying the war goes on out-
side the walls their culture is one of
war and that is all they know we es-
tablished it that way we intend to keep
it that way you see this is the pit here
the bodies come the ones who have died
here the bodies are sorted roughly onto
the conveyor belts which take them to the
dismembering wards

  the car whirred them away the next
station gleaming white rooms-shining and
sterile danton felt the perspiration stream-
ing down his throat

  electronic machinery examined the
bodies mechanical hands removed them
from the conveyor belts with deft selec-
tivity deposited them on wheeled white
slabs

  you wifl notice rhone said calmly
that the bodies have come through an
antiseptic room and their clothing dis-
solved now they are ready for dismem-
bering

  men in white moved silently down the
line and did their work with sharp quick
strokes scalpels and tiny whirring saws
and the bodies slowly dwindling into iso-
lated parts there was no blood no mess
everything was efficient and thorough and
clean

  the usable body-parts are selected
here rhone said notice the depart-
ments along the walls by each slab they
are refrigerated they contain separate
sections for each of the salvaged body-
parts that are worth preserving

  behind glass in the walls danton saw
neatly placed parts of the bodies hearts
fingers hands legs feet bone sections
eyes and interior organs kidneys spleens
livers carefully preserved neatly arranged
and labeled and waiting

  danton slowly licked his lips her voice
seemed far away now droning like an
insect on a lazy day far from anywhere
and the endless length of that room seemed
dust-mantled and still so still he thought
and unreal but it was real

  from here any part of a human body
can be replaced by our surgeons here is
the source of our immortality when any
body organ becomes worn it is replaced
we are stocking our body-banks soldier
as you can see

  danton could see what he saw was
blurring a little though and his legs
seemed numb when he tried to move them

  why does it affect you so she was
asking him then and he turned and looked
at her

 why

  he didnt really know or else his brain
wasnt functioning at the moment why
it was beyond horror it was alien and
yet why should it be alien as a soldier
why should he find it disturbing he had
been conditioned and his conditioning had


planet

stories

allowed him to destroy millions by press-
ing buttons by directing missiles he never
saw in flight to a target he never saw
dissolve in a great white-hot flame

  here it was planned and here death
had some transcendental meaning

  theres one more thing for you to
see she said

  a dimly-lighted series of chambers she
pointed them out refrigerated banks as
far as danton could see the long cham-
bers were lined with huge banks each
filled with spare body-parts

  you see the pattern now soldier we
started with a select group from among
the oligarchs only the elite of the elite
was selected to come here to mars there
are fifty pf us now as there were fifty
then no children of course why com-
plicate things

  our slaves out there know nothing ex-
cept that they must fight the redbirds
theirs is a war society we arranged it
and weve perpetuated it and now its the
only life they know-unless your story of
a revolt is true of course which i can
hardly believe they have only the crudest
weapons the kind of weapons we fought
with on earth soldier left little for body-
salvage did they we feel weve found
the only way of being immortal why does
it affect you like this soldier doesnt it
seem logical and fair to you 

anton didnt say anything he
couldnt his throat was dry and his
blood hammered past his temples she was
putting the question to him all right and
in a way it was the same question he had
asked himself more than once to an effi-
ciently conditioned soldier class killing
was an end in itself why not go on from
there carry it out to its final denominator

  the brain never wears out she was
saying the only damage possible to it
is due to the wearing out of sup-
plementary body-parts and they are
seldom used to such a point and even
parts of the brain can be replaced we
have blood banks of course we cannot
die of natural causes if death comes from
any kind of violence or accident we
can bring that body to life again

  we are storing up reserve body-parts
to keep us strong and un-aging for as
long as one would care to imagine when
we are ready of course we shall return
to earth we have kept that in mind
naturally we are almost ready now to
return on earth of course the same
system will be established-but there our
system will of necessity be slightly dif-
ferent perhaps wars will not necessarily
go on unceasingly there will be breath-
ing spells  it wont matter particularly
to us

  she looked at danton closely first
we shall wipe out most of the population
we only need a small stabilized popula-
tion to provide for us

  what about the redbirds danton
said his voice sounded weak it was
weak this is their planet doesnt-
their bodies are too alien she said
they cant be of any benefit to us ex-
cept of course they provide conflict for
the mongrels

  danton closed his eyes there was no
more confusion he knew now where the
road led if you stayed on it to its end
it ended here with bodies stacked up in
refrigerators it ended with the cancella-
tion of all human values except the values
of the fifty select-and they were no
longer human in any familiar sense

  he felt sick very sick it might be
embarrassing he was so sick he said
i dont feel very well maybe i could
rest here for a few minutes

  she laughed she stopped laughing and
danton heard the sound of doors sliding
and the approach of softly moving feet
two oligarchs - guards evidently for
each wore a flash-gun at his side and be-
tween them-

  danton didnt quite believe what he
saw and if what he saw was true he
didnt know whether to be glad or not
keith and van ness the latter was
terribly wounded his face a red smear
blood soaking his side and keith-keith
danton had decided was a dangerous man

  one of the oligarchs said we brought
them directly to you on weissers orders
weisser talked to them then sent them
down here he said that you would
know-
martian nightmare



  she raised her hand and the oligarch
guard stopped talking danton looked at
keiths rigid white face keiths lips
thinned back over his teeth as he grinned
at danton captain he said i guess
you beat me to the punch i see youre
already on friendly terms

  van ness moaned softly and fell to
his knees he stared sightlessly from his
broken face

  danton said i thought you two were
gone for good

  so did we keith said but the red-
birds dropped us over a tower down
a chute i dont know why

  rhone said the redbirds fight for
us too we pay them for every body
they bring to us they receive pay a
kind of drug

  she stared from danton to keith then
at van ness you three seem to know
one another ill find out from weisser
she started to tune in the communicator
on her wrist keith stopped her dont
bother he said ive already talked to
weisser this man here has been lying
ill tell you the truth

  danton had been afraid of this keith
dont tell them anything but he knew
somehow that his own game was over
it had never had a chance even without
keiths selling out it wouldnt have had
a chance it was walking the road bravely
that counted anyway  

  keith said im talking and ill be
glad to talk

  danton shouted keith dont do it
dont tell them anything you dont real-
ize what they are

  it doesnt matter keith said what
they are ive been on the wrong side
maybe i was always an oligarch and
its probably the same with you only
youre just too stupid to admit it you
think i want to go back to earth even
if we had a chance to do it which well
never have i hate earth and maybe i
always have hated it-the way the new
order remade it its sane everyone an
angel filled to the hair roots with the milk of
human kindness we found it no place
for us weisser says hell take me in
i know where i belong

-planet-j anuary

rhone stood up in the car look-
ing into dantons face its true
then the three of you are from earth
i thought they were planning a culture
down there that couldnt possibly be ag-
gressive how could they have sent you
dantons eyes went from face to face
round the immediate area of the vast
chamber keith was grinning thinly watch-
ing him narrowly this was it and there
seemed nothing to do but to go down
fighting in the classic vein a futile ges-
ture but what else

  he said it was done in secret only
we three and one other knew about the
flight tell the truth it might keep them
from invading earth for a while if they
thought earth had an army they would
strike before earth grew any stronger
the truth might keep them quiescent for
a while longer the new social system
there it has no conception of warfare or
violence you wouldnt understand it and
they wouldnt understand you not now
you used our ship to get here she
said that would indicate that you have
no ships of your own there

  danton nodded keith laughed a thin
high laughter he moved toward rhone
he dropped to one knee and raised his
hands to her they have no armaments
no ships psychologically they have no
power to resist weisser said i could be-
come one of you

  danton pushed rhone from the car
he shoved the control lever and the car
whirled violently slammed into the fore-
most oligarch guard sent him spinning
across the metal floor the car swerved
again struck down the other guard dan-
ton jumped free ripped the weapon from
the mans waist the guard was groaning
and his hands were sliding about vaguely
over the floor

  the hand-gun was familiar it was sim-
ilar to the flash-guns used by the guards
on earth a century before there would
have been no need to have altered that
weapon

  keith ran at him kicked out and dan-
ton fired keith went to his knees and
looked at danton dully and then fell for-
ward he rolled over and lay there grin-
ning blankly at nothing at all

j
	planet stories

  deliberately without feeling anything
danton burned the life out of the two
oligarchs who had lain stunned where
they fell as he spun back the woman
stood stiffly almost up against him he
had expected her to atteinpt to run away

  she said softly iiow what it is
now its because yourfrhuman its hu-
man to grow older its human to die
maybe we have the wrong idea or maybe
weve approached it wrong i dont know
it doesnt matter now i-

  he pressed the flash-gun toward her
she didnt seem to notice the gun she
continued to look at his face into his
eyes searching for something he couldnt
tell what and he didnt care

  did you know you have gray eyes
she whispered and that they deepen get
darker and darker

  no

  no no one ever told you

  mara had told him he barely remem-
bered that time when she had told him

  she put her slightly opened mouth
against his lips and pulled him closer

  he pulled the trigger her body quiv-
ered as though from the kiss and then
he stepped away and she fell at his feet
he wasnt thinking now there was no
time for that he lifted her carried her
toward one of the refrigerated banks
her skin had turned a mottled ugly color
and her eyes were open and rigid quite
suddenly her eyes moved up into her
head and ugly groups of purple little
veins appeared underneath the skin

  he put her on the frosty floor of the
huge bank around her like some hideous
garnishing were eyes that looked at her
accusingly he dragged the two oligarch
guards and keiths corpse into another
bank slammed the heavy door van ness
groaned and danton lifted him into the
car

  i cant see van ness whispered i
cant see im dying

  hang on danton said only fifty
oligarchs understand van forty seven
now maybe less if those seven i shot
down in the pit didnt all recover maybe
we can get some more of them van
im dying van ness whispered i
cant see

danton tooled the car as he ap-
proached doors in the long tubular
halls the doors opened automatically
closed again behind there were turns
drops risings more doors other halls

   he stopped the car lost alone some-
where only fifty of them-no forty-seven
now at most they wouldnt have too
large a structure here somewhere there
would have to be a central power source
if he could find such a power unit strike
at the heart-

he shook van ness he felt for the
heart it was still beating van ness
moaned im dying if i could see-
do you know what im saying van
can you hear me

  yes    sure i can hear you
listen to me were in the oligarchs
fortress i dont know how big it is but
it seems to be one unified structure there
has to be a central power source here
you were an engineering expert where
would it be van listen there are only
a handful of oligarchs here now we
stand a slim chance  

  but i cant see-

  i can see

  yes-a central power source i remem-
ber the words to an old song captain
you know soldiering used to be a great
sport there was one about a chocolate
soldier with a uniform so pretty   
van ness

  yes

  where would they build that central
power room up down

  down

   he started the car moving oddly curv-
ing and angling corridors bending with
geometrical precision he saw an elevator
door and he pressed the button the door
opened and he drove the car into it down
fast sickeningly fast

bottom    clear down van ness
mumbled start from there i cant see-
danton kept the elevator dropping and
then it stopped he hadnt stopped it

  he stepped to the side as the door
slid open he hit the entering oligarch
hit him with a short hard blow in the
solar plexus and when the man gasped
and bent forward danton brought his
knee up bone and cartilage crunched the
martian nightmare



man slewed to one side and danton hit
him again and the man smashed into the
wall and slid down toward the floor

  i cant see van ness said but what
i hear has a sweet sound

  danton dragged the oligarch up held
him against the wall the man sagged and
lifted his hands to protect his face his
lips were torn his nose bleeding he stared
dazedly at danton his eyes filled with
terror shock

  wha- he started to say something
danton pushed his flash-gun into the
mans middle and the oligarch screamed
dantons voice chopped into the scream

  im going to kill you danton said
unless you tell me what i want to know
tell me where the power rooms are the
central power units

  the man shook his head no

  danton moved the gun around pressed
the stud burning flesh and the oligarch
jerked away and fell twitching on the
floor his left leg charred from the knee
down he sat and stared at the leg and
he started whimpering he reached down
with his fingers then drew them back
again

  tell me danton said or whats left
of you even the body parts from your
banks wont put back together again
the oligarch murmured and he had
changed his mind

he oligarch led them into the
gigantic room then collapsed dan-
ton killed him where he lay danton rec-
ognized some of the equipment though
he was no nucleonics or electronics expert
as van ness had been listen to this
van listen to me

  yes   

  danton told what he saw he was van
ness eyes the generators huge oscillo-
scopes vacuumtube voltimeters electronic
power-supply panels rolls and skeins of
hook-up wire shielding of every color
size and shape panel plates huge racks
of glowing tubes elaborate transceivers
long solid surfaces of gleaming bakelite
color-indexed files of resistors and capa-
citances   

  van ness told danton what to do
van ness took a long time to say a few

words and after that he didnt seem to
be able to say anything else he didnt
move either danton released the force of
the flash-gun left the gun in the position
van ness had indicated its beam burning
deep into the heart of the complicated
soul of the oligarch fortress

  he would have taken van ness with
him but van ness wasnt interested any-
more he was dead danton left him he
would remember van ness alive as long
as he was capable of remembering any-
thing van ness as clay he had already
forgotten

  he ran toward the elevator as it
whirred upward he felt the reverberation
the trembling the beginnings of a low
deadly murmuring the elevator con-
continued to rise smoothly carrying dan-
ton and the car but danton felt a giddy
swaying like that of an earthquake

  a social system strictly of the top-
down variety but in the final analysis
the top wasnt the mind of rhone or of
weisser it was something above both
of them above the oligarchs machines
and above the machines generators and
switches and volts and tubes

  the electronic interdependence was go-
ing insane within the fortress like the
intricate cellular structure of a mind
within a skull

  in a hall somewhere in a catacomb of
metal danton sat in the car wondering
which way to go wondering if it would
make any difference now feeling the for-
tress above below all around him break-
ing apart

  what about the oligarch spaceships 
perhaps they were someplace else away
from here and they would survive the
destruction of the fortress and maybe
one or two or three oligarchs would also
survive even one ship one oligarch re-
turning to earth would be one too many

  he was looking at the far door as it
slid open and a car sped through skim-
ming along the polished metal floor fran-
tically desperately the occupant of the
car a woman took no notice of danton
her face was damp and pale with fear
as her car sped past her machines were
forsaking her her efficiency her gadgets
and the tremendous power that had existed


planet stories

for so long at her fingertips were disin-
tegrating and she appeared to be disinte-
grating with them

  she would be intent only on escape
of course not realizing that without her
machines she was doomed but she might
find a temporary escape from the death
around her the metal walls of the gi-
gantic coffin

  van ness was gone and keith-con-
vinced that soldiering was an end in it-
self rather than a means to an end-had
found the inevitable end for a soldier

  danton wondered about that he knew
one thing-that the test was yet to come
for him he was not sure yet that keith
had not been right   

  he followed the woman through a door
into a chamber it was a nice room dan-
ton thought a great deal of pleasure had
drifted through this room and in it time
had probably never meant anything per-
fumed incense music drifting still rising
from somewhere pneumatic couches-but
underneath something was cracking open
veins and arteries of power choking
blocked off but the power had to go some-
where short-circuit the madness of a
great machine-mind

  the woman had opened a panel and
beyond her danton could see the martian
afternoon he had never seen a martian
afternoon before it was beautiful he
thought though he was hardly in a posi-
tion to study or appreciate it properly
then he saw what she was doing-the
woman was escaping out the panel there
must be some way she was planning to
get safely to the ground outside it seemed
to be d long way down

  but she wasnt worried about that

  she jumped she looked back at dan-
ton her face pale and twisted then she
jumped danton ran looked out he
looked out just in time to see her body
hit it was too far down for anyone to
go that way her body bounced a little

insane danton thought they had
each become such component parts of
the bigger machine that very likely they
were all going crazy now right along
with the machine and the machine wasnt
going to last much longer either insane

or otherwise it was beginning to quiver
to shake and shudder and its metal skin
was beginning to groan and twist its metal
joints were grinding together its skein
nerves wrenching and singing

  danton looked around hurriedly he
saw the wires again everything suspended
by wires shiny and strong he gave a
heavy table slab-legless of course a
suspended disc of metal-he gave it a
tremendous shove and it began to swing
to and fro it made a heavy pendulum
swinging wider and wider and it began
to crash into other suspended things into
chairs and into weird sculpture crashing
through structural images and distorted
faces of metal it made a sound like off-
key bells bonging and clanging

  wires finally snapped with a whine and
danton felt the hot sharpness as a strand
cut across his arm sinking in like the
slash of a knife he pushed the table slab
to the wall against the window he man-
aged to get several strands of the wire
tied together by complicated knot designs
he yanked down an ornamental drape
that seemed to have a swirling life of
its own made sheaths for his hands from
finely-woven metallic cloth and looped
the wire three times around the metal
sheathing

  he slid down toward the ground it
was further down than it had seemed
from above the wind was high and cold
and strong he began to sway dangerously
and the wind threatened to tear him from
the wire

  he glanced upward the structure of
the oligarchs was huge a shining silver
metal thing of coldness rising up out of
bare rocks it was built on the side of a
cliff very high and very far below was
a valley perhaps it was the valley in
which he had landed    no that must
have been far away from here he saw
no lake but of course the valley itself
stretched windingly away further than he
could see

  he ran out of wire he managed to
lift his weight with one arm enough to
unwrap the wire coils from the other
that gave him another three feet he
dropped pain came from a wrenched an-
kle and the shock of the weight on his
martian nightmare



bones but he hit running and he kept on
running

  for somehow though he had killed her
she was alive

  just before dropping he had seen her
running away from the oligarch tower
running along a steel walkway a fine-
mesh railing separated the walkway from
a sheer drop of at least a thousand feet
it was rhone she was running fast too
very fast

  he ran hard he didnt feel the pain
in his ankle he couldnt afford to feel any-
thing now except urgency the cold thin
air burned

  she stopped and he stopped too flat-
tening against the hard rust-colored rock
she was pushing a lever or something
whatever it was it got results a silver
nose projected outward from the cliff
slanting slightly upward it blossomed out
as though someone were blowing a silver
bubble from stone out and out it
stopped

  it was a spaceship all right danton
figured that the power shut-off had pre-
vented her from reaching the ship from
a subterranean route evidently rigged for
such an emergency the wall of the cliff
could also summon the ship out into the
open prepare it for blasting off from a
cradle cut down into the cliff like a giant
cannon barrel

  when the outer door in the side of the
ship opened rhone ran for it danton
was right behind her she heard him just
as she went through and into the air-lock
she turned her mouth opened and then
he struck her with his shoulder carried her
on through the inner air-lock door and into
the tubular corridor leading forward into
the control room

  he dragged her forward with him as
the doors closed behind him the con-
trols were the same in principle as those
of the ship he had brought from earth
once set they were automatic he strapped
rhone in the shock-seat at the side he
strapped himself into the chair before the
control panel   

seers secretary of social security
was a fat man with a serious round
slate-gray face he looked at danton

                       in thrilling ad-
  venture and fast-action stories read
  fiction house magazines

look for the bulls-eye on
the covers   

two complete

   science-adventure books
 indian	planet
 sheena	football
 jungle	baseball
 two complete detective books
 two western books
 two western action books

thoughtfully waited outside the office of
sociology section in new world square
the sky was a soft and promising blue

  finally seers said well danton what
happened then

  danton shrugged first i dropped
enough atomic fire to finish destroying the
oligarch fortress completely and to get
any ships that might have been left inside
the mountain theres nothing there now
but a big black crater i dont think there
will ever be any need to worry about
the oligarchs anymore i landed the ship
in the pacific in as isolated a spot as i
could find-midway between new zea-
land and cape horn then i contacted you
by short wave and here i am and here
you are and i guess thats all there is
why did you bring rhone back

  i had no choice danton said i guess
when i killed her and put her in the re-
frigeration bank that saved her life some
surgeon did a quick job on her danton
leaned toward seers if all of it or any
of it really happened

what makes you think it didnt
for one thing im back here alive
an impossible mission accomplished for
another-i-well this time i want to be
reconditioned
	planet

  your experience has changed your out-
look danton

  considerably i-want to be changed
i want to be someone else anything else
ive seen things too horrible to remember
anyway id rather forget everything it
could all have been delusion hallucination
rigged up in your psyche  labs as keith
said-you boys are good at that sort of
thing if thats how it was-it was good
therapy theres a doubt in my mind you
see it might have happened and just the
bare possibility that it did happen is
enough to make me gladly volunteer for
reconditioning

  seers nodded im very glad youre
approaching it this way it will make the
processing easier to perform and the new
personality easier to maintain we prob-
ably will never need your kind again dan-
ton now that the oligarchs are gone
the last threat to our new system is gone
with them the chance of some other in-
telligent life-form being in the universe
at all is remote and the further chance
that they would take aggressive action
against earth makes the whole thing some-
thing we can logically ignore

  thats fine danton said

  youve seen where the psychology of
war would lead inevitably if you can
justify killing human beings at all the
final result is bound to be in some form
or another what you saw on mars

  if i actually saw it if i was on mars
t all

  seers signaled through the intercom a
door opened rhone stood there a tablet
in her hand and a pencil she sat down
and crossed attractive legs very attractive
legs danton thought

  miss tannon this is richard danton
mr danton my new secretary miss tac-
tion

  she nodded turned her nose down once
more very business-like into the tablet

  danton thought its rhone all right
a reconditioned rhone they must be
good at their reconditioning to change an

stories

oligarch mind into that of an efficient
secretary danton said what about the
others up there on mars

  well take care of them peacefully
of course seers said we have plenty
of time we wont bring them back we
will set up our new system there
danton listened to seers dictation to
chief psyche-adjustment administrator
from seers department of social se-
curity subject voluntary reconditioning
of richard danton to take place at once
under the jurisdiction of  

  there was more danton didnt hear it
  and later they injected something
into his veins and he sat there feeling
richard danton dying for the last time
going away richard danton fading out
all around him bit by bit cell by cell
dying never to awaken again and re-
membering what he had experienced on
mars danton thought its as good a
reward as anyone could ask goodbye ri-
chard danton it was nice knowing you
but goodbye   

 tjis name was burton

  he zvas as happy as anyone could ex-

well adjusted as was everyone of course
in the new world system

  burton worked ten hours a week in a
coal mine though the job zvas merely one
demanding the overseeing of machines
the rest of the week ivas one of leisure
devoted to gardening hobbies play music
there was no more hate no violence no
feelings of insecurity it zvasnt that every-

just that no one zvas afraid of the future
anymore

  and burton zvas no longer bothered by
bad dreams either and so he zvas what

inal the one youve used ever since the first
vizigraph the cut certainly wasnt lost i hope 
like what happened to one of the competimags
oh well just try and get it back did and got
it good idea-ed

  egad an english prof in la viz could it be
that snearys deathless prose brought him in
incidentally wonder what sam would give me
for this effort last year in my english class i
took a couple bs because so said ye prof my
handwriting which i had to use was so rotten

  well hooray for mr drinkwater rodric
cadwalleder drinkwater good heavens is
that a name i had heard of such things but i
never thot they were anything other than a
hoomer writers half-hearted attempt at hoomer
he saved me from slow insanity i had been try-
ing to figure out ever since i read that letter about
the half-life of uranium why a small piece of
uranium would disintegrate completely in such-
and-such a time if it had already been half-dis-
integrated in the past while another small piece
never before disintegrated would take twice that
long oh mr drinkwater i didnt know you
were listening im sorry your name is beautiful
that is i have heard worse-donno where but
i have

  i suppose i should vote for the letters i
dont gotta do all three i hope anahoo ill give
first to james stewart for his first paragraph
reeeeeellllll cute and his first effort james boy
meet another first-effort-in-ps--year-old you
he dear ed who whats going on here-
ed sound like you are interested more than
somewhat in astronomy som i in fact i think
that my interest in astronomy led me to start
reading stf muh first mag was planet nearly
seven years ago with hankutts eyes of
thar well enough of that revolting drivel

  oh yes stories you do run a few of those
things dont you vellll ill give first spot to
your new discovery liddell but just what goes
id still like to know what the he    heck the
pool and mountain was all about all i
got from it was that all the real tough guys
that dropped dead on venus were made into
dvahnyans but where did the pool come from in
the first place huh and what sort of a critter

was the monster that guarded it i always thot
that stf stories were supposed to end with a
logical scientific explanation and only fantasies
left things like the origin of the main thing in
the story unexplained and this little tale could
stand a sequel if only to explain where the pool
etc came from

  and of course second comes mitkey rides
again it wasnt quite as good as the original
which i read otjjy last winter in a second-hand
mag but still quite a thing pore mitkey wont
he and minnie ever get to keep their intelligence
couldnt be that therell be another something
like mitkey rides again once more
yet i think we could all take it very easily
only how come lynch didnt illustrate it as he
did the original  this mayan is something of a
stinker as far as art goes oh gad a boner
mayan didnt dun it vestal did well he is the
same only a little worser you didnt like
vestals starmouse illustra-
tions  oh well ed

  i bin thinkin it over second place in letters
goes to hapke he agrees with me about your
hack goofur him

  back to the stories now comes cargo to
callisto cute okay so its overworked i
substitute nice still no good off-trail uh-
uh small and agreeable  little tale joe was
a rather stupid little stinker tho wasnt he took
him an awful long time to realize what was
going on

 next theres a tie sidewinders from
sirius  machine of klamugra
neither one had much of a plot both had un-
usually horrible blurbs fearless ace of ter-
restrial g   stood at the brink of the
vast amphitheatre   how droopy can you get
that former sounds like a fugitive from hang-
dog strongheart infallible invincible hero of
the spaceways the guy that writes such junk
should be taken out and strung up by his typing
finger the latter the story not the blurb was too
obvious i suppose it was supposed to be a sur-
prise ending but anyone who has graduated from
high-school even grade-school should know that
that would be a negative number and that its
impossible to find the square root of a negative
number

  coppels offering was pretty good but i put it
way down here because of his awful epilogue
these two lived in memory  as adam and
eve now id just like to know who didnt figure
that out before they were half way through the
names aram deve santane the serpent were
dead giveaways then that business about the
third planet being paradise and last but by no
means least the fifth planet being bombarded into
our asteroid belt if he had just come right out
and said that this was humanitys ancient past
i could have forgiven him but trying to make
it into a surprise ending cooked his lousy little
goose he should stick to his hack which he is
very good at second only in his martian tales to
la brackett  get g f fox and brackett back

  last and by all means least is final mis-
sion that is sub-standard for the magazine so
far below the usual macdonald as to be next to
impossible if he had continued and made it into
a novel it might have been something they could
have gone on out into space and found out what
that thing they had seen beyond antares was
now that would have made a story as it was it
was just a prologue to a novel or novelette

dear jerome

  hmm well well so my letter made the
grade eh very good name in print and all that
a thrill one might quibble that the page upon
which it appeared was not too well inked nor was
the paper of superlative quality-too the k in
kyne had a faulty serif-however one will not
bleat about such trifles but will instead express
gratitude for one of the heartiest yaks one has
had in several months namely  something he
disagreed with ate him oh you bix you
devil what must you be like with the women
arf-ed

  anyhoo to the stories

  carry me home liddel as i said in my
last letter is one corking beautiful writer and i
mean writer quite apart from the very excellent
quality of his science-fiction thought the man
knows people he knows words he explores one
with the other with a depth and-if i may use the
term-a tenderness most uncommon in the pulps
carry me home is on all counts one of the
best jobs ive encountered in the commercial field
stf or no more more-forgive me for sound-
ing like a ittle fan-more

 the last two alive sound enough
opera i presume however that you intend to
improve the quality of your lead stuff as you de-
plete your predecessors back-log opera can be
somewhat more cerebral than this and still zip
along at an action-packed rate as witness any-
thing van vogt has ever written

  mitkey not up to the original but what
could be entertaining worth reading illustra-
tions very good

machine of klamugra a clever if ele-
mentary plot well handled and quite well written

 sidewinders from sirius  hah hah
again a double twist and a really obnoxious
holmesian slob for a hero a good parody indeed

  final mission a quiet unusual little tale
ma donald had a nice idea and tied it up with
his tamiliar dexterity pathos and a sour taste
followed by a warming of the heart

  cargo to callisto this sir is doubt-
lessly something left over from pss old regime
though the writing was in places top-notch the
total worth of the story was disappointingly far
less than that nf the same authors superb the
crowded colony in the last issue

  dianetics well if its as good as ron and
the boys claim it most certainly is an earth-
sliaker yes ive bought the book im reading it
i intend to thoroughly investigate anyone would
be an idiot not to do at least that

dear jerry 

  three things generally make me rather casual
in my regard for ps one is the arbitary two-
pages length double-spaced of this letter an-
other is that if any of my letters were ever good
enough i should have to tell you that i have
absolutely no use need nor desire for illustration
originals the third is that planet does not lift
me to immortal altitudes of ecstasy

  to me thud-and-blunder stf is nothing to rave
about but i do not denounce thud-and-blunder
for various reasons im glad we got it your
competitors which i read with oxygen mask con-
veniently handy sometimes do attain high alti-
tudes-but more often alas the result is more
in the nature of chemical warfare and while
planet never promises to plant me in the
clouds it usually does provide a quiet hammocks
hour or two in the shade of a cool back porch i
would as soon speak against tb stf as denounce
comic books movie serials and western horse-
operas or beer

  like to add sam to this flot and jet since his
merwins mags made the same mistake in spell-
ing isaac asimovs name as yours may i suggest
that just for the sheer hell of it both you and
sam enter a pact to make the name azimov a
house pseudonym thered be plenty hell all
right  i dont know about sam but isaac can
lick me any day of the week-ed or maybe i
should start using the pseudonym joe azimov
hmmm surely the greatest compliment is to
imitate

  fred brown could make something big of this
mitkey character it would probably be necessary
for mitkey to renounce his rodents happy exist-
ence and at the same time renounce human
idiosyncrasies which dont apply to him-a fine
study in individualism that would bring sweat and
curses from any author trying to write it but it
would probably be good thoughtful satire

  this dianetics deal has me muttering dark mut-
terings so maybe its good so maybe it isnt
good so maybe it would seem to be good but-

  without plunging into hubbardisms it seems
that this dianetic therapy soups up the mental
cylinders by boring out the demon-circuits
demon-circuits like the guy whos afraid of dogs
because his first dog scared him such dogs also
referring to poverty sex racial and religious
prejudices what-liave-we the thesis is that it all
starts before birth and proceeds developing with
growth and balls up our thinking processes more
and more as we grow older the therapy claims to
go back to the beginning and erase the entire
demon-circuits by attacking their source this is
my terminology of course not hubbards

now if it does it certainly ought to soup up
our mental ability but is it good to lose those
the vizigraph	

demon-circuits evn though they do hamper us
i recall combat vets who had a slight inclination
to belly into the gutter when a rocket  went
buzz-z-zing past when they got back and walked
down the home-town street certainly a lunatic
impulse from a civilian point of view but sup-
pose they go back into combat and that thing buzz-
z-zing past aint no oldsmobile and how many
other demon-circuits are there that while purely
lunatic and mentally hampering most of the time
have kept the human species in existence through
moments of real danger  have dianetics clears
lost some vital survival factor danger often
comes with such an emotional shock that even the
most efficient analytical thinking would have a
tough time coping with it and whats never
dangerous 

  what we may have here is a new definition of
the fittest who survive

joe gibson

wickham on dianetics

 w th street

new york  n y

dear mr bixby 

  i am afraid that this letter will run longer than
the limit you request but since the subject js dia-
netics perhaps you wont mind ill promise at
least not to go over mr hubbards book point for
point but to confine myself pretty strictly to the
points raised in james blishs brief piece in the
nov issue

  i dislike to pick a fight with mr blish whose
science-fiction i like but it happens that when he
talks about psychiatric theory he is entering a field
about which i know something and i just dont
like some of the things he says im not in sym-
pathy with encouraging this dianetics craze its
obvious that mr blish is being quite cautious and
that he hasnt endorsed dianetics in his article
but just the fact that ills article isnt obviously
damning will be enough to encourage joe dope
to take his wife his dog and all the fans for
miles around into dianetic therapy these are my
criticisms then

  	dianetics is not a science it is obvious
from hubbards book that hubbard has only a
dim notion of what constitutes a science he thinks
that if a thing works consistently then its a
science and thats that unfortunately true
sciences dont work on the principle of statistical
successes in the field of medicine in particular
there are so many imponderables that it is seldom
possible to say whether the therapy cured the
patient or whether he cured himself- witness
the sudden collapse of the histamine theory of the
common cold three hundred people is a ridicu-
lously small series of cases even statistically con-
sidered  and have all these cures been followed
for five years to make sure they dont relapse
the answer is no and you neednt take my word
for it call the hubbard dianetic research foun-
dation and ask them

  furthermore in order to say with reasonable
certainty whether or not a mental patient has been
cured you have to have a reasonable definition
of what constitutes a cure its not enough to say
that a clear has no engrams so long as there is
doubt whether or not there is such a thing as an
engram even in the field of psychosomatic dis-
ease cures usually consist simply of a change of
symptoms people have been hypnotically cured
of arthritis that is the arthritis has gone away

for quite a long time-but something subtler and
more serious usually appears in place of the
arthritis and the cures relapse

  in the case of dianetic therapy there is always
the possibility that what is happening is simply
the creation of an overmastering obsessional sys-
tem which replaces the patients other neuroses-
to his apparent benefit but to his lasting damage
insofar as his contact with reality is concerned
to be blunt about it hubbard would be unable
to detect this because a he lacks knowledge of
previous disciplines and b he has the same
neurosis-he invented it of course one doesnt
invent a neurotic condition but one can supply
the details

  the experiments which hubbard has asked
laymen to perform upon each other are not experi-
ments they are just dabbling no layman is
equipped to tell the differences between a simple
question and a hypnotic suggestion-hubbard
himself seems to think of hypnotism exclusively
in terms of trances and tricks whereas hypnotic
suggestions may be given to wide-awake people
without the suggestor being aware of what he is
doing-nor could a layman tell anything about the
truth or falsity of hubbards hypotheses by what
some patient told him in therapy about the most
worthless thing in any branch of medicine includ-
ing psychotherapy is the testimony of the patient
who is always more than anxious to be cured
by any damn thing that is handed him hence the
quacks who make money by giving people sugar
pills-which sometimes do cure the patient

  	i can add from my own experiences that
mr blish is right in saying that the phenomena
described by hubbard do appear that they appear
in the order in which hubbard says they appear
and that they do seem to produce subjective
changes in the patient this proves nothing whatso-
ever the very first thing that happens to a patient
when he changes methods of psychotherapy is
that his symptoms change too i wonder whether
or not mr blish has worked on any patients who
have not read mr hubbards book if mr blish
has read it surely his wife has and i suppose you
have too has it occurred to any of you that the
book itself-whatever its intention-offers the
patient a blue-print of how he ought to react in
dianetic therapy and that therefore a patient in
therapy will need for his own sanity to react as
described harry stack sullivan observed some
time back that there is an enormous drive toward
mental health in everyone which accounts for the
reason why patients in any psychotherapy improve
somewhat and why all forms of psychotherapy-
including faith healing-produce some cures
any help that is offered is gladly accepted and
cooperation extended except by some psychotics
have any of you people worked on any cases who
have no knowledge of dianetic theory

  	i have to object also to mr blishs implica-
tion at the beginning of his article that nobody up
to mr hubbard knew anything about the opera-
tion of the mind mr hubbard would like you to
think that this is so but it isnt nothing whatso-
ever--i underline that for heavy emphasis-in
dianetics is at all new to psychotherapy the re-
combination of the elements is new but the ele-
ments are not mr hubbards theory of the
reduction of engrams is freuds abreaction
mr hubbards theory of life force is findable in
jung and bergson mr hubbards apparently
sensational theory of somatic recording comes
from the studies of the anxiety neurosis particu-
	planet

larly from mrs greenacres survey of anxiety-like
somatic reactions in the unborn child mr hub-
bards experimental recovery of material from
unconscious periods was duplicated at the be-
ginning of this century by breuer mr hubbards
emphasis upon the integrity of the patient is
jungian mr hubbards and mr campbells
general and specific analogues of the mind to a
computing machine are the intellectual property
of dr norbert weiner and so on such identi-
fications may behobson-jobsonismto mr camp-
bell but it is hard to dismiss them if you know
something about the material with that swear-
word

  	i object to mr blishs identification of her-
mitage house as the publisher of a number of
books universally acknowledged to be serious
contributions to the field its no such thing it is
a publisher of surveys most of them slanted for
the layman it does publish works by a number of
reputable people but none of these works are
original contributions to psychotherapy they are
simply historical summaries collations eclectic
books if youre in any doubt about this consult
hermitages own book list ill award you a large
pink lollipop for every book on that list that you
find that is not simply a survey of previous work
in some part of the field

  my own advice-not that you asked for it-is
that you mr blish and your readers take dia-
netics with a large salt pill so far there is not a
single shred of real evidence for it-and the lay-
man is not the least bit obligated to prove mr
hubbards claims for him let him prove them
for himself if he can maybe he even can-at
least its high time he started trying

al wickham

   blish on dianetics

new york n y

dear jerry 

  mr wickhams letter seems to me to consist
largely of indisputable facts some of which are
relevant and some of which are not

  im perfectly willing to agree that dianetics is
not a science in the sense that mr wickham is
using that word as he himself has pointed out
by accident perhaps not even medicine is a
science in this sense only mathematical sciences
such as physics are properly speaking sciences
while ill admit that i was-strictly speaking-
wrong in referring to dianetics as a science i
must argue that all the healing arts are based
largely upon the principles of statistical successes
exact knowledge in mr wickhams sense does
not exist in any branch of medicine yet

  but mr wickham is right in saying that 
cases is too small a series to establish a really good
case for dianetics he is right in saying that the
cures claimed by dianetics have been inadequately
followed considering what claims have been made
for dianetics indeed he might have gone on to
remark that even these  cases seem to have
been rather sloppily run-otherwise the founda-
tion would be much more willing to show us some
of its case-records than it has proven itself to be
hubbard and his friends seem to have been in a
tearing hurry to get their therapy to the public
and in my opinion their haste-was excessive

  i have to hand just today a form letter from
donald rogers-who is the foundations research
director-which seems to indicate that the foun-

stories

dation is now convinced of the need for better
evidence and is compiling such evidence well
have to wait and see whether or not it actually
comes through with it rogers seems to have a far
better understanding of what constitutes real evi-
dence than hubbard does which is a hopeful sign

  no i have no real experience with patients who
have not read hubbards book the one such
patient with whom i have worked appeared to
respond according to hoyleubbard but i was
unable to pursue the experiment to anything like
proper confirmation

  i disagree with mr wickhams statement that
nothing whatsoever in dianetics except the mix-
ture is new to psychotherapy its true for in-
stance that the problem of prenatal somatic re-
cording is foreshadowed in the work of mrs
greenacre and much more importantly in the
work of otto rank whom mr wickham does
not mention but no-one prior to hubbard has
centered the sources of major mental disturbances
in the prenatal area as for new principles no-
one prior to hubbard has claimed that physical
pain is the one source of all psychic disturbance
no-one prior to hubbard has claimed that the
semantic content of pain-experience is the sole
ddterminator of the nature of the subsequent dis-
turbance no-one prior to hubbard has claimed
that the actions of concepts upon the mind to
produce illness are wholly literal-if homonymic
-and never symbolic

  it remains to be proven whether or not these
principles are valid but i dont think any of them
are findable in previous psychotherapies as mr
wickham implies id like to add though that
many of the concepts and tests which hubbard
claims to be his alone are not his intellectual prop-
erty  and that i think one of the most disturbing
things about dianetic theory to date is hubbards
apparent desire to palm off his many indebted-
nesses as his own discoveries this does not in
itself make hubbards theories invalid but it does
make one realize that hubbard himself is no
saner than the rest of us and emphasizes mr
wickhams point that dianetics is not a science-
and that hubbard cant yet be described as a
scientist

  freud didnt behave very much like a scientist
either it would have been nice had hubbard
learned something from freuds procedural mis-
takes but he didn t and we shall have to swallow
that down with regret and continue to investigate
i continue to think hubbards theories largely
reasonable logical and provable but certainly
hubbards claim that they are already proven is
a false claim in this respect dianetics reminds me
overpoweringly of orgone therapy full of claims
about scientific evidences and proofs but shifty
and evasive when the proofs are asked for

  mr wickhams characterization of hermitage
house seems to come from the book list on the
back of the dust-jacket for hubbards book he
should investigate hermitages complete list her-
mitage incidentally did not publish hubbards
book without some investigation of the claims-
an inadequate investigation but not an unin-
formed one

  mr gibsons points being purely hypothetical
dont have quite the same air of urgency as mr
wickhams after all before we discuss what
might or might not be the characteristics of clears
we have to be sure that there is such a thing as a
clear i think his questions could best be answered
by a re-reading of hubbards book which plainly
the vizigraph



 explains the difference between a demon-circuit
 and a training pattern there is virtually no likeli-
 hood to use his example that an avoiding-reaction
 to the noise of the buzz-bomb would be engram-
 mic in most cases not all automatic reactions are
 engrammic by any means as for the elan vitale it
 is hubbards claim that dianetic therapy increases
 the amount of it available to the organism as a
 whole rather than the other way around

   as for mr wickhams advice i second it third
 it and endorse it all the way up the line to the
 power where e approaches infinity certainly one
 must take dianetics with a large salt pill-the big-
 ger the better it is unproven i would add also
 no one without extensive pro-
 fessional experience and an
 exact knowledge of scientific
 method should experiment with
 dianetics no one should accept on faith
 hubbards statement that amateur psychotherapy
 on hubbards principles or any other principles is
 undangerous hubbard has not yet proven this to
 be so and until he proves it the risk is serious

   here i am with mr wickham  leave
 dianetic experimentation to hubbard the burden
 of proof lies on him i have terminated my own
 experiments in this field and i urge anyone else
 who has been tempted by hubbards claims to do
 the same the theory of dianetics appears to be
 sound and backed by virtually all of die research
 done by previous workers but it may
 nevertheless be totally and dis-
 astrously wrong

   i dont think hubbard is wrong but thats noth-
 ing but a belief on my part backed by a very small
 amount of evidence too small to be conclusive i
 think planets readers should read hubbards
 book for despite its faults its a remarkable job
 and already part of the significant history of
 psychotherapy and planets readers are
 science-fiction fans and can be depended upon to
 be critical

   to be critical-when one is reading reich or
 hubbard or velikovsky or frank scully or any
 other would-be revolutionary-means that one
 must ask over and over again

   where is the evidence

   where is the evidence

  where is the evidence

   no hoax program special pleading myth-
 system delusion crank notion or partial sci-
 ence can stand up under that one question

if hes found a kindred soul in you ha imagine
an editor with a soul ive found one in him ye
gods shades of the three musketeers hes
got a sense of humor and what is so rare as a
sense of humor then if ever come perfect jokes
etc

  give number two to mr badler and his bem

  oh yes methuselah-oops i mean mr gibson
the guy to whom you refer wow nu-ed
was one david bushnell but youve got some
details crocked up

  	the submarine could surface at will it
didnt have to be hauled up

  	the propeller was in front not in back

  	the mine was carried on the back and
attached by a wood screw to the ship it was not
carried on top and attached by hooks

  	the turtle was sunk while makin a second
attack on the british ships under its own power
and not while being moved to a new base

  and now having made myself extremely popu-
lar with mr j g is there a bodyguard in the
house ill quit ramblin on my dont you look

dear jerry 

  concerning c stewart metchettes speculations
on the origin of kalgan as the name of a planet

  i did not consciously borrow doc smiths name
when i wrote the mule in  i needed a
name for a planet it was wartime and there was
a large map of the far east on the wall kalgan
was on the map it is the name of a sizable city in
the province of chahar inner mongolia which
is located about one hundred miles northwest of
peking it sounded like a good name so i used it

  concerning mitchell m badlers speculations on
the presumed identity of mr coppel and myself

stories

  sorry but mr coppel is not me except for
one extremely short piece long long ago i have
never used a pseudonym and thank you mr
badler for your kind words about the foundation

my dear j b

  i found much pleasure in reading vizigraph in
the fall ps this is the first copy of planet
stories i have bought the reason is that though
i have long been an sf reader i am so repelled by
the covers on many of the lurid pulps that i am
ashamed to be seen on the street with them under
my arm so the ones i willingly buy are the more
restfully appareled i shall however undergo the
same ordeal when your next appears

  maybe one might shed a little light on how
things are defined i seem to have rung in on the
tail of a hot controversy about defining sf but
i have a strong impression that the contenders
have been defining extensionally this consists
in looking over a group of individual items try-
ing to abstract from them their common features
then framing a definition from those abstracted
features this is the most common way of doing
it and most usually comes to grief the alterna-
tive and generally preferable method is to de-
fine intensionally this is simply saying that the
class which you are trying to define is that class
which consists of item  item  item   etc
it shifts the point of view from the contemplation
of glorious abstractions to the problem of whether
this or that questionable example is rightly in-
cluded in the class this leaves it all a matter of
custom and individual opinion which is less soul-
searching than the other method but leaves the
problem right where it belongs and saves a lot
of paper

  extensional definition is lots of fun but funda-
mentally no good man for example can be de-
fined only intensionally

  i vote a large and conspicuous monument to
strange exodus as among the best and
most original sf i have seen in a long time and
a small ugly negative monument to coppels
valkyr lets keen wagner out of this also
the vizigraph



why make an interplanetary dark ages story
when the same could have been done with three
counties in old england and a real warlock the
only thing in it that might have been sf was the
power drives in the space ships use horses alone
drop the galactic setting and have a story that
stays within bounds but dont publish it in ps

dear jerry 

 the november issue of planet stories
was a pleasant surprise most of the stories were
very readable unless you happen to be chinese
or afgan the last two issues were sadly lack-
ing in this respect i fear but enough of that
let us hope that such travesties as rebel of
valkyr are gone forever

  oh-oh i spoke too soon i see that coppel is
still present-adam and eve tales have been
popping up quite a bit of late after a merciful
interment and the last two alive is
the worst the one in ss-or was it tws-
was the best of that type ive yet read let us
have no more please

  the mitkey sequel was fairly good but
obviously written on demand if it wasnt that
statement is going to make me look awfully
silly ja zo  now go look in a mirror-ed
however i enjoyed it something is wrong with
my typing and i can only pray it will straighten
out amen-ed

 carry me home reminded me of brac-
kett which is about the highest praise i can
think to give the author let us have no nonsense
about venus bearing it should be being a
desert-world with a formaldehyde atmosphere
and little or no water stories such as this and
deatii-by-rain which i also enjoyed
ignore those facts-and it will never be certain
what exists thereon till man bridges the distance
to venus and looks for himself

 sidewinders from sirius was a very
cute tale that final sentence almost caught me
off-guard the unexpected always makes a good
tale cargo to callisto was average
planet not particularly bad but not par-
ticularly good either machine of kla-
mugra was a bit too ingenuous everything
was obvious from the moment that minus square
root was brought into the picture final mis-
sion was a fair atmosphere story not quite up
to macdonalds usual par but the third-best in
the issue behind mitkey in second and
carry me home i dont get the title but
it sounds as if it should have some atmospheric
meaning in first

  i have seen no one whose martian stories com-
pare to burroughs stewart said shades of
burroughs six months ago i would have
jumped on him but now i am mellow with old
age huh however let it be said that erb
is still the master of adventure and that since
i enjoyed his martian stories and didnt enjoy

coppel of course nothing could possibly be
wrong with me looked in that mirror yet-
ed some of erbs early martian tales are
slightly hacky nowadays but they were the first
long stories first short ones too for all i know
he tried and they were written in the style of
the times in chessmen of mars he came
close to writing real literature and usually in his
stories you will find subtle satire of something
or other-the communistic doctrine for instance
the green men were ruled by a form of com-
munism-common ownership of everything

  enough of that

  pics-gibson stewart and izic azimof
yipe sorry isaac-ed for a cute little let-
ter claude held says coppel is asomiv oooo
that was accidental is this true if it is i
can see why he doesnt want it known if  had
written that trash i wouldnt publicize it either

  is this what we call suspense advertising-
shanadu yos its also what we call free
advertising-kluegste dui-ed dont ask
what it means you will learn soon enough i
have more also two names wayne keller and
edward chapman since the only connection be-
tween them is that they emanate from north
tonawanda dont waste your brains trying to
figure them out just wait two months more

  you arent perfect yet and i suppose you are
well aware of that and have an eye on the fate
of plp however planet begins to climb
once more

dear ed

  ive been trying for years now to bolster up
enough courage to write to la vizi and at last
its bolstered the courage i mean youll ex-
cuse this letter if its too late for the september
ish but where i am its darned hard to collar a
copy of any kind of american mag and when you
do manage to get one its years old literally
but this month i was lucky after much wheed-
ling pleading threatening and grovelling i man-
aged to extract from my favourite bookseller
a copy of planet  fall issue whatever that
is it says  on the cover so i figure it cant
be too old i wont try to classify the stories be-
cause i dont want a headache but heres what i
think of them

 rebel of valkyr okay for an adven-
ture mag you should have run it in action
stories

  death wish maybe i caught bradbury at
a bad time but twerent so hot

stories

 the crowded colony i liked this one

 the sky is falling not too bad

  meem st clairs blubbering  nuff said

  star ship another adventure story but
well written

 strange exodus best in the mag

 patch no comment

  everyone seems to comment on the covers so
why not me  duh  er  editor  what is
the babe doing or is that a stupid question
dont answer that it looks to me judging from
what she is holding in her hand like shes testing
out the propulsion powers of a flying saucer i
could be wrong though i dont know whether
to congratulate you or sympathize with you on
becoming the editor of ps anyway you can
choose which one of these sentiments you prefer
may i mix them-ed

  looking up my back numbers of planet it
seems that its usually here that people moan
about untrimmed edges well dont faint but
i like em now let me seeoh yes illustra-
tions  im going to be difficult here-theyre all
lousy

  howm i doin for space  oh well ill squeeze
a little more in anyway

  it seems that whenever i pick up a stf mag i
find sneary in the letter column it wouldnt be
so bad if his typewriter could spell properly

  and heres lin carter too theres one thing
thats always puzzled me here-its  er now
dont bite a piece out of the horsehair sofa lin
but-are you a him or a her there ive said it
i can feel the walls trembling already not to men-
tion me anyway i agree with everything heshe
says that calm you down a bit lin 

  im thinking of writing a book called english
for the moron for the benefit of unfortunate
people like a leverentz

  hah you squashed mr sigler nicely ed

  ill bet bruce hapke is still laughing over your
little poem i am

  i see i have someone who agrees with me on
bradbury shake mr pryor

  now just in case this letter finds its way into
la vizi i wish to state here and now that i
came into the world before ramon navarro or
van johnson hit the screen so you can leave my
name alone i think ive overstepped my space so
 mind if i write again 

                    tah muchly

                 ramon van rensburg

well lin  what are you

                            box 

 	lynn haven fla

dear bix 

  one veddy nice issue this time me friend in
fact surprisingly good i like the new type the
new headings and the contents-page setup is very
welcome mr editor youre making a good start
in this readers not-so-humble opinion

  and the stories were slightly better than
average if i may add a little more praise
rebel of valkyr tho just another of le-
gions of pseudo-erb adventures had a vivid and
colorful style that was eminently readable the
character of keiron or was it kieron im at-
tending the lynhavention in lynn haven and
dont have my copy to refer to was adequately
developed the style reminded me-this is pretty
far-fetched i fear-of a sort of cross between

 
the vizigraph



 brackett and isaac asimov the mentions of
 kalgan and the quotes from essays on galactic
 history strengthened the asimovian air good
 yam tho and a nice fresh twist on the ending that
 saved it from the they all lived happily ever
 after rut

   i was frankly disappointed in poul andersons
 first story for you that boy is one of the better in
 the new crop of authors and ive seen several
 astonishiugly good yarns with his by-line but this
 one seemed as if he was abandoning his usual
 style in an attempt to write at your usual level-
 which i am not belittling or anything dont get me
 wrong-and in doing so turned out the very con-
 ventional and totally uninteresting story star
 ship there was not a shred of originality in the
 thing still i hope you can get some more stuff
 from him fine writer and every writer of his
 calibur has the right to an occasional fluff

   the bradbury offering this isli was middlin
 good slightly better plot than usual for brad and
 of course his regular superlative style that makes
 anything sound good not a bad story at all

   of the others none seem exceptionally out-
 standing the crowded colony had an
 incredibly clever twist to it albeit a twist that
 was very hard to swallow mr drexel has ideas

    letters were quite interesting this time nis tu
 see sumthen frum sneary agin and i have re-
 frained so far from letting out any war-whoops
 of hysterical joy over the new bi-monthly schedule
 not without straining thats swell news wunner-
 ful but its been so long a quarterly pub it wont
 seem like the same ole peeess besides now i
 cant be leisurely about getting my letters in like
 i usta

   for the letter prizes douglas creighton with
 an extremely good letter and whose opinions on
 bradbury i share o for another brat story 
 sneary as ever entertaining and ed cox mod-
 esty forbids my casting a vote for carters witty
 and casual letter o to be able to write a quiet en-
 tertaining little missive like that

    well reckon ill call this a letter i hope-but i
 have my doubts-that this gets in under the wire
 i am a trifle late getting it in but thats a con-
 vention for you try to-go on just try-get any
 private work done with such scintillating wits as
 shelby vick or harry b moore breathing down
 your neck and holding fascinating discussions
 anent fandom and the true literature within
 ear-shot

    thanks for an all things considered pretty good
 issue my friend mr bixby ill be looking for-
 ward to other such issues under your aegis

you please this is my first letter to a prosine
when ackerman was a pup this was a fact to be
heralded by  point type and the letter read
something like dearsiriamonlylyearsoldandi
havebeenreadingyourmagazinesincekindergarten-
andlthinkthatitisjustgingerpeachyandswell but
today there is an evil cruel menace waiting to
pounce upon fans who are so unwise as to have
their names printed in a widely-circulated maga-
zine  it is the spirit of organized fandom as soon
as the issue containing this letter hits the stands
a horde of demons will swoop down to the news-
stands and with many a fiendish giggle will copy
down every name printed therein within a few
short weeks my mailbox shall spew forth free

mic cowboys the national stf correspondence

thats gambol wise-guy in the sun

 on to the nov planet armed only with a
flitgun

  cover-okay so im a shnook i like it ander-
son is one of the top cover artists in the s-f-or
or any other pulp field his action is solid and
undeniably eye-catching his women are most
definitely attractive his tone is lush and his
color looks as fresh as though it had been ap-
plied directly from the tube andersons been re-
stricted by house requirements and regulations-
a few other s-f mags have the same regulations
and look at the messes their covers are

 carry me home-wow youll go down
in history bix as the man who discovered lid-
dell mr liddell possesses a rare combination of
skill freshness color action emotion and in-
telligence this story combines fantasy and sci-
ence-fiction without hybridizing either and most
important its an allegory those beautiful names
-dvahnyan llghirae the mans great lets have
a lot more of him

 the last two alive-the lead novel is
getting more respectable all the time i rather
enjoyed this one and nobody can say that the
ending was unfounded in the earlier parts of the
story

 mitkey rides again-cute and lived up
to its predecessor brown leaves himself wide
open for another sequel though

 sidewinders from sirius-and ma-
chine of klamugra-both nice the for-
mer nosing the latter out because of its double-
twist ending and its protagonist

 final mission-the whole story was
given in the blurb which speaks well for neither

 cargo to callisto-pretty punk the

stories

plot is hackneyed and the handling is hack the
line that especially got me was the one that went
something like you could tell she was a mar-
tian by her arching eyebrows and thin nose
hah sure humanoid races on other planets are
not only possible but probable only remember
humanoid means like a human mars has less
than y earths gravity consequently a martian
humanoid would be at least half our height
hows that again--ed besides an earth-
mars marriage is as likely as a man mating with
a cobra and being blessed with an ostrich an
even more glaring error appeared in st clairs
story of two issues back meem briefly st
clair proposed a race of neuters and females and
a small rodent-like animal which was the func-
tional male of the race fine but how do those
rodent-like animals meems reproduce or per-
haps those talented vaudrians are capable of
giving birth to neuters females and meems
these flaws are always killjoys no matter how
good the story may be back to your story drex
what really burned me was your using the old ed
hamilton trick of having mercurians venerians
terrans and martians working together if h
sapiens cant even get along with other members
of his own race how the hell is he going to make
friends with alien species-now that everybody
knows who jerome drexel bixby really is i sup-
pose that youll have to get a new pen name like
-oh-robert a heinlein

  rocketship x-m-ackys reviews are always
somewhat putrid this one was no exception e
took the picture too seriously i saw it and
thought it was immensely humorous it was es-
pecially clever of the writer-director to have the
crew take along rifles and guns on a lunar expedi-
tion

 dianetics-im getting damned fed up
with the big mouths who keep yapping against it
without trying it out sure i believe in it the
same way i believe in electricity
