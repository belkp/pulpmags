sierra sams cadaver

the flumeville stage rolled down into flume-
ville at precisely six oclock when the sun was

iust sinking behind the pine-clad peaks of the
ivide and the miners were quitting their
days work and coining into town from the
scene of their labors

  as the stage always brought in the mail for
those of the rugged citizens who were fortunate
enough ever to receive any and as the ponderous
vehicle always stopped at the tavern to unload
its mail and passengers six oclock always saw
the representative citizus of the little city con-
gregated in and about the tavern

  flumeville was what an observer would have
called a well manned city for the inhabitants
were all men

  only one woman had ever dawned upon the
rugged horizon blow which the little mining-
camp nestled only one ca-e of the softening
influence of the opposite sex was known among
the knights who wielded the pick and shovel in
flumeville gulch

  the usual crowd was drawn up in line before
the tavern when long lige the jehu of the
stage brought the vehicle to a halt

  it was a rare thing for the stage to drop a
passenger at flumeville but to-night a man
clambered out of the conveyance valise in
hand and struck a bee-line for the bar-room
where he procaeied to wash down the dust of
travel with a glass of  bug-juice

  after he had inclosed the beverage h
smacked his lips with a grateful air and looked
around him to take note of bis surroundings

  every inch a six-footer as he stood in his
boots he was as lean as a bean-pole-no appa-
rent superfluous flesh existing anywhere upon
his skeleton-like frame to which his poorly-
tailored garments hung with great looseness

  his face was equally thin and pinched and
wore a ghostly and cadaverous expression
while his eyes black and sharp as a hawks
were sunken beneath an overhanging pair of
shaggy eyebrows his hair was tow-colored
while of beard he wore none

  after looking over the rough audience with
an inquiring gaze the skinny gentleman turned
to the bar-maid  jim jacksons gal mag as
the proprietors daughter was called-a smart
quick-witted and by no means homely true-
western miss of some sixteen summers who
ran the tavern while her father labored at the
cradle

  ahem nice day the thin man observed
by way of opening a conversation

lovely miss maggie responded busying

herself at polishing off the counter  jest
drap down on the hearse

   i did that expecting to find more of a
town i am from big vista-heard of it i dare
say my name is j unius brutus dunk

   indeed what a delightful name maggie
said with mock soberness  i spect youre
one o the big guns up at big vista mr dunk
-eh 

  the lank man looked displeased

   my name is not domcey miss-but junius
brutus dunk i flatter myself that i am one
of the representative gentlemen of big vista

   i judged likely maggie allowed turning
half around to suppress a giggle  let me see
-havent i heard something about there having
been a famine up there lately 

  dunk colored for he tumbled to her hint
quite readily he was at first inclined to frown
but finally brought to the surface of his cadaver-
ous face rather a ghastly smile

   well not particularly although i might
personally illustrate the contrary he replied
 by the way you seem to be a pretty pert-
young miss-maybe you can answer me a few
questions

   well that depends can tell better arter
you ax em	

  thats sure as you live well to begin
with do you know a man here in flumeville by
the tiame of sierra sam

  maggie looked surprised

   waal i should say so she confessed with
a nod  guess thars few as dont know sam-
my

  ah then i am in luck by coming here
what sort of a character is this sierra sam

   he waal  guess youll find hes about
the strangest character you ever tackled ef
you go a-nosin inter his business when he
aint disturbed hes jest as playful and kittenish
as ye please when hs riled hes bad

   so i hear well i must interview him at
all events if i get demolished please have my
remains expressed back to big vista

   waal jest let me remind you that thar
wont be no need of that maggie suggested
 sammys a pulverizar sammy is and if he
should ever shake up your bones thered be
nothing left for transportation

  dunk was probably not of that opinion how-
ever for he wandered leisurely about the bar-
room awaiting the appearance of mr sierra
sam

  in the course of an hour that individual put
in an appearance armed with a shovel and
pan and somewhat more mud-splashed and
grimy than was usual with the dashing moun-
tain ferret

  his face and figure however had lost none of
the old-time grace of outline and his eyes
glowed with the same good nature as of old
his long hair swept down to his shoulders from
beneath his jaunty sombrero his mustache and
imperial were as neatly pointed as ever

  after depositing his tools in one corner he
turned and gazed at the occupants of the room
with a nod his eyes finally resting upon dunk

  something like a waggish glitter shot into his
eyes as he scanned the attenuated man but 
turned his glance away so as not to betray it
sierra sams double



  dank seeming to realize that sam was the
man he was looking for soon came forward
and tapped the californian on the shoulder

   excuse me my friend- he said  but have
i the honor of addressing sierra 

   i allow you have if so be there is any
honor thereto attached sam responded dryly
 i am generally known by the name of sierra
sara

  and i am junius brutus dunk esq of
big vista at your service i came here 
purpose to hunt you up and have a talk with
you on a matter of importance so if you will
grant me a private interview we will at once
get down to business

   well if your business is as important as
you intimate perhaps we had better adjourn
to my palace sam suggested  come this
way

  he led the way from the tavern to a small
log-cabin near at hand where be  lived when
he was at home as be explained while en
route

  it was furnished after the primitive frontier
style aud yet was a neat and withal a com-
fortable abode

  sierra sam seated himself upon a stool at one
end of a long rough table and motioned the
man from big vista to take a like position at
the opposite end

   well mr dunk i am all attention proceed
to unload as rapidly as you like

   that  tv ill sir the other replied  in the
first place i wish to announce that i came here
for your individual interest providing we can
come to terms-that is to say i have an im-
portant revelation to make to you which is
vastly to your pecuniary interest

   ah well that is good news am i to fall
heir to half-a-dozen gold mines or a million or
two in government bonds

   well that depends i am here the posses-
sor of valuable data that to you means much
i am the kind of a man who lives by his wits
in preference to manual

  so i should estimate sam smiled stroking
his chiu judging by your personal appear-
ance however the effects of subsisting on the
strength of your wits lias rather rubbed against
your constitution not

  dunk frowned

  you are inclined to poke fun at me be de-
murred evidently displeased  when you
come to know me better you wont do this
why my dear man  can lay you gently in the
lap of luxury or do you incalculable injury at
will my mission here is speculative i come
to make terms with you if you choose if you
dont why i have other ends to further

   consequently i am to know you as a super-
annuated shyster eh sam assumed dryly
 my friend i dont think i care to entertain
any dealings with you

   but you dont understand-you dont know
what you are talking about my dear sir you
dont seem to realize that i am the man through
whose instrumentality you can win or lose a
fortune

   you think thusly

   i know it all youve got to do is to come
to reasonable terms and i will put you on the

track of a priceless fortune which otherwise
you must remain in ignorance of all your
life

  well thats a pretty broad mouthful for
you to ask me to swallow sam declared calm-
ly you may be quite sharp as far as sharp-
ness goes but at the same time i flatter myself
it takes an uncommon human to ring in a deal
on saml

   this is no deal

  wrell maybe not according to your out-
line if i pay you a sum of money you will in
return give me a fortune now how much
money do you want in case i should feel dis-
posed to dicker with you

   ah you talk business now the man from
big vista exclaimed rubbing bis hands together
patronizingly  it show what good sense you
possess i have always heard tell of you as a
brave noble srt of fellow and i cannot find it
in my heart to be hard c-n you so if you will
give me a thousand why ill give you the se-
cret and well call it square you cannot make
an independent fortune easier

   not to let you tell it very likely but you
see i know better supposing  were to turn
around and tell you what you wish to sell to
me

   that you cant do dunk growled

   but i can though you wish to inform me
ten hundred dollars worth that i have a rich
old maiden aunt residing in big vista

  junius brutus looked astounded

   this old maiden aunt tabitha green by
name happens to be nearing the portals eternal
possessed of two valuable gold mines having
read no douht of the promised difficulty rich
people shall encounter in getting a passport into
the realms of bliss she wishes to give away her
riches to one of her two nephews of whom i
chance to be one is this not so

  well

   having known tabithas desire to see her
long-haired relative with a view to heaping
upon him some of her superfluous cash you
hired by nephew number two set out in search
of nephew number one for the purpose of ter-
minating his existence in case you cannot make
better terms with him

  the californian was now eying the man from
big vista sternly the latter sat rigid on his
stool his face even whiter than usual

   i knew you were coming-i am glad to meet
you sam pursued with triumph  i guess
we can settle this matter here as well as else-
where dont you think so

  and as he spoke be drew a revolver from hi
hip-pocket and laid it on the table

  dunk gave vent to a gasp he was trembling
in every limb from fear-that was evident
enough

  what you dont mean to do me harm
sierra sam he articulated faintly  you are
wrong in your estimation of me i have no de-
signs against your life in coming here  simply
came to-

   make money out of me but you cannot do
that  am elways alive to all my personal in-
terests you bet and able as a general thing to
anticipate the moves of my enemies i do not
propose to harm you sir you are beneath my


sierra sams double

notiee but i want to show you that you are
as powerless to do me harm as a new-born babe
i see you have a revolver in your belt please
draw it level it at my head and fire

  dunk saw the cool californian fold his arms
across his breast and a treacherous fire shot
into his sunken eyes he made an effort to move
his hand toward his belt but could not

   he tried to leap from his stool but could not
scarcely a muscle could he move while an ex-
pression of excruciatiug torture came upon his
cadaverous face

  sierra sara fairly roared with laughter and
picked up his revolver

   you see you are mine did i choose to use
you he said see and he touched a small
knob at one side of the table you were held
by electricity which the stool administered to
you in such gradual currents that you were not
aware anything was the matter until you were
powerless you are now at liberty to go take
the first stage back to big vista or ill shoot

sou tne next time i see you when you get to
ig vista tell all parties concerned to look out
for the arri val of sierra saml on the th of
julv go 

  without further urging junius brutus left
the cabin to all appearances he was a very
cowed and crestfallen man

  but within his heart there rankled a venge-
ful rancorous grulge against the calm man of
the sierras and once outside the cabin he mut-
tered

   yes i will go back to big vista and-

  the and was spoken with emphasis and
seemed to imply a threat

     v chapter il

mistaken in the man

    all aboard veiled the driver of the stage
plying between kuuestowu silver spur and
big vista  all aboard  next station is big
vista

  and he gave an extra emphatic crack to his
long-lashed whip to warn his would-be passen-
gers that a start was to be made instauter from
silver spur where a halt had been made for
supper

  a number of passengers poured out of the
lunch saloon eating as they came and clam-
bered into and onto the great vehicle

  among those who came last and was conse-
quently forced to resort to the top seats of the
conveyance were two characters likely to at-
tract more than ordinary attention-the more
perhaps owing to the great contrast in their
personal appearance

  one was a young female clad in top-boots
trowsers a long hunting-shirt of knee length
belted at the waist and a plumed sombrero-a
girl of about seventeen summers evidently
with a fresh round rosy pretty face sparkling
dark eyes and happily-chiseled features-a girl
who although of a somewhat reckless nature
was amply able to take care of herself under all
circu instances

  the other party was a meek-faced clerical-
looking individual with a fringe of cravat-
whiskers beneath his chin and reaching to the
ears a pair of deep blue goggles shaded his
yes his face was one of most sepulchral cast

his hair was bushy streaked with white and
was topped out with a genuine quaker broad-
brim hat

  otherwise he was attired in fine broadcloth
and beiug lame walked with a cane

  it was vvith a great effort that ho clambered to
the top of the stage-at least he gave vent to
enough grunts and  ums and ahsl to indi-
cate the fact of his physical disability

  the girl sport who had nimbly mounted
ahead of him seemed to enjoy his attempt huge-
ly as did two other outside passengers whom it
may be well to describe here

  the one was a typical specimen of the border
rough not one of the evil-natured class evi-
dently but of that bragging blatant species
commonly denominated in western life as bull-
whackers-a fiery red-haired full red-bearded
chap the end of whoso nose was as red as a
cherry whose eyes emitted a gleam of sluggish
shrewduess and whose attire was about as greasy
and mud-begrimed as it well could be his belt
bristled with revolvers and knives which it was
evident he would not hesitate to use if it became
necessary to do so

  the other man was of more dashing appear-
ance-was possessed of a fine figure and cool
handsome face with clear unwavering dark
eyes a firm pleasant mouth shaded by a grace-
ful mustache he also wore a trim imperial
his hair drooped to his shoulder and altogether
he looked and dressed remarkably like the
frontier ferret sierra sam

  the quaker finally succeeded in gaining a
seat on top of the coach jehu jack gave his
whip another crack aad away went the horses
and conveyance down the rough mountain trail
just as the sun was setting over the rugged land-
scape now dotted here and there with summers
green

  from one side to the other swayed the pon-
derous coach owing to the unevenness of the
trail threatening to capsize at any minute
and the clerical individual grew extremely
alarmed

  stop stop he cried out to the driver
 you have us killed drive slower i say

  go to jericho heartily responded jehu
 im drivin this yer stage pards an i reckon
i regilate ther momentum ter suit my own self 

   yas uncle the girl sport interposed ey-
ing the quaker amusedly  taint no use git-
tin skeart jehu jack knows his y z s
you bet

   verily i asked thee not for advice unseem-
ly-clad girl was the retort given in a chiding
wav

   oh you dont eh the girl queried a slight
flush coming to her cheeks dont like my
style o gear then

   verily i do not i mought say i was never
more shocked in my life to witness such an un-
becoming masquerade in a young woman
verily the world groweth more and more sinful
each day ah um

  and he heaved a deep sigh and held tighter
to the railing for fear he would be jerked off
upon the rocks

   yas you bet she grows right pat every
day the girl said  sorry ye dislike my togs
tho old gent cause im a square gal ever

day in a week and kin lick any galoot a says
i aint my handle is trumps thats my sheer
of the game o life too jest put on male attire
you see because i want to vote an then too
it makes locomotion easier bet yer boots yell
get worse shocked than at me ef ye land down
in big vista

  obediah potts as he afterward gave his
name did not reply but instinctively clapped
his hand to the region of his trowsers pocket
probably to see if his pocketbook was safe

  trumps laughed at this

  youd better hang on to yer wallet uncle
she suggested  et aint an oncommon cir-
cumstance that this hyar hearse has been halted
by road agents and the passengers relieved of
their filthy lucre preachers dont stand no
more show than pilgrims wi the knights of
kleptomania

   bet yer boots they dont or my name aint
snodgrass the snorter put iu the bull whacker
 it dont matter ef a mans a parson or a van-
derbilt-the gents pockets his rhino jest the
same guess taint much the galoots wull ever
get out o suodgras the suorter tbo

   ye dont want ter go snortin tew certain
about that trumps warned looking the man
over with a single searching glance sfect
big meu has to weaken when it comes to facin
road-agents spose tho judgin by your title
that you are some pumpkins when youre tew
home

   waal i am that you bet i am bad-very
bad snodgrass asserted with a dignified air
that was ludicrous in itself  i am sometimes
so bad that bull towns stampede to escape my
vengeance my principal holt is swallerin men
half-way bitin off their ears an spittin em
out i alius breakfast on a pairoi tender souse
dine  a bite of some galoots clean-shaved
cheek and sup on a plump arm or spare rib
oh yes pm snortin bad am i snodgrass

  and with a grave shake of his bead the
bad man- serenely proceeded to pick his
pearly white teeth with a knife

  obediah potts smothered a groan of righteous
horror and cast a sidelong glance at the red-
headed man of cannibalistic propensi t ies

  if he had any idea of expressing his opinion of
a man of such inhuman tastes his intention was
cut short by the sudden halting of the stage in a
gloomy pass

  the cause was evident enough

  on every side of the coach swarmed a crowd
of masked men iu red flannel shirts and black
pants top-boots and plumed slouch hats and
every man except one held a carbine leveled to-
ward the coach

  the excepted man who was burly of figure
and evidently the captain of the band at once
advanced toward the coach

   shell out gentlemen he called out stern-
ly  no time for parley your money or your
lives

  no one responded

  obediah potts teeth began to chatter although
his face did not seem to grow particularly pale
and it struck trumps who was watching him
that the teeth-chatter was more a piece of actin
than anything else

  come come the road-agent chief cried

if you dont pan out ill order fire ye cant
trifle with me

  tbe inside passengers responded by handing
out their pocketbooks trumps snodgrass the
suorter and the long-baired passenger also
handed over pocketbooks somewhat noticeable
for their flatness

  at which the captain growled

   say this is a cussed poor haul he cried
with an oath aire ye sure ye aint got any
better ter offer-

  better tackle outward-bound stages they
pan out better pilgrims generally go in broke
and come out flush trumps explained with a
laugh

   mebbe tbe captain responded  hello old
quake wheres you mite

   verily sir i am a minister of the gospel
and my purse bath in it but sufficient to purchase
a single meal obediah said faintly

  cant help it-shell out thecaptain or-
dered  tumble it down beer

  with a groan the solemn man obeyed then
the captain fixed his gaze upon the long-haired
man upon the stage heretofore mentioned

  sierra sam be cried you will be re-
quired to stop off and accompany us to head-
quarters youre just the man weve been look-
ing for

  the long-haired man looked astonished

   what dye mane be demanded in a strong
irish accent  im no sierra sam at all at all
terry mcnorrins me name sur if ye plaze
but you see i dont plaze despite your
well-feigned irish brogue the road-agent de-
clared  youre sierra sam plain enough to
suit my notion so pile down cff from that
stage instauter or ill have you shot where you
are

  mcnorrin saw that it was useless to disobey
so he reluctantly descended from the stage

  as he i-lambered down snodgrass the bull-
whacker whispered

 it neednt worry you ill get your release
 get along with that stage yelled the cap-
tain as the irish spotter stepped down upon
the ground  tbe next time ye come along
see that ye fetch more swag

   next time youll get a lead chromo maybe
trumps called out

  then the stage rolled rapidly away jehu
jack whistling as merrily as if nothing had
happened

  it was not tbe first time bis conveyance had
been baited by these same gents of the trail
and therefore it was as he remarked  second
nature to him

  after the departure of tbe stage-coach mc-
norrins arms were bound behind his back and
he was sent ahead of the main gang in charge
of two of the outlaws

  after leaving the pass they struck a route up
the bed of a little creek which flowed through
a transverse ravine

  following this stream by slow stages for an
hour-for the water was knee-deep and wading
was difficult-they finally emerged into a rocky
pocket or mountain-surrounded valley where
some time there had evidently been an indian
	sierra sam double

village for a number of skin-lodges still stood
in a circle

  mcnorrin was taken to one of these lodges and
left there duly the captain remaining with him

  after taking a drink from a bottle that stood
upon a sort of deal table the outlaw approached
the irishman

   so you insist that you are not sierra sam
do you be demanded

   faith and i do terry replied  shu re i
niver heard divil a thing of sierra sam afore
and dont know a won of him

   i know better you see i have an acquaint-
ance who met you over in flumeville a bit of
awhile ago and you sent word you would be in
big vista the fifth day of juiy this is the th
and you are sierra sam

   beg the pardon of yez but you lie like the
divil teddy declared unflinchingly  i niver
was in flumeville in me life dye mind the
red-whiskered galoot on the stage

  yes

  waal sur he spake in me ear as i got off
not to be onaisy as hed fix it up all right for
me-so very likely that was your man in dis-
guise

  the captain uttered a curse

   if you should chance to b right it is a
remarkable coincidence this chance resem-
blance and all that saves your life he growled

  he then blew a whistle and another road-
agent entered

   i say king look at this man sharply is
this sierra sam

  the road-ageut stared hard at mcnorrin and
shook bis head

  dont think so he said the two are
remarkably alike however indeed i can de-
tect but one difference-that too something no
one else would notice

  the outlaw chief retired from the lodge in
disgust

  two days later he once more visited mcnor-
rin in the lodge where had been confined

  you were right he said  i have re-
ceived a communication that satisfies me you
are not sierra sam outside you will fiud a
man ready to escorc you back to the vicinity of
big vista

  after the irih spotter was gone the captain
swora roully and took a letter from his
pocket an i opened it

  it ran as follows

                       bio vista july tli -
dp wolf deering sir-

   the man yrn took from the coach is not sierra
sam although sierra sam arrived here the same
hour the coach di i and male inquiries for you
you had better return when it shall pleasa the
writer of this to give you further information

                        yours etc unknown

   and who the duce is unknown deering
grunted as he tore the letter into shreds
 possibly the male-attired girl who sassed me
back from the coach if so i shall have to buy
her off or-

the two snodgrasses

  big vista

  location-in the sierra nevada

 site-high up the mountain-side upon a
natural shelving ledge or plateau which over-
looked the yawning gulf below and beyond
this a lower rugged broken range of hills
sparsely timbered and possessed of some rather
wildly beautifully scenic qualities not to the
rugged eye of the miner but to the eye ro-
mantic of the day-dreaming tourist

  it wasnt much of a city big vista

  it possessed enough able-bodied men to work
its quartz drifts which ran back into the moun-
tain  it had a small complement of gamblers
roughs and adventurers in general such as are
identical with nearly every miuing-camp and
that was about all not forgetting that big
vista possessed several citizens of the fairer
sex

  access was had to the place by a dizzy stage
route that wormed its way down the mountain-
side and through the gulf toward silver spur
but it was seldom traveled except by jehu
jacks semi-weekly stage

  of the business places in big vista might be
mentioned first of all the post-office which
was located in a little cigar-store shanty super-
intended by one angel then followed a general
store five saloons a smithy ore-breaker and
mill several small enterprises a theater and
fifty shanties

  the  post-office however in the miud of
some people was rhe most attractive place of
interest in big vista for the reason that it was
superintended by the  purty gal  of the place

 angel she said her name was when one
morning she dropped down into the rough
camp but angel what she did not mention

  she said she was out of luck and wanted to
know if there was any sort of position in big
vista where an honest and respectable girl
could earn a decent liviug

  a meeting was at once held and the question
considered and it was decided there was

 chauncy bloker big vistas blear-eyed p
m bad recently been suspieioned of horse-
stealing to say nothing of robbing the mails
so the aforesaid bloker was immediately in-
vited out to a lynch picnic and angel was in-
stalled in his place at a moderate salary she
soon succeeded in saving up enough to purchase
a stock of cigars and tobacco and combined the
two businesses profitably

  in some respects the girl with her seventeen
or eighteen years did not fall short of what her
name implied

  it was no matter of secrecy that she was the
prettiest piece of femininity that had ever set
foot in big vista

  she always dressed plainly but yet neatly
her every move indicated grace and refinement
she was habitually agreeable to customers but
still enough reserved to preclude the possible
idea that she cared to be sociable with any one

 this very fact made her more friends than
she was aware of even though it may have won
hgr a few enemies

  one moraine nearly a week after the stage-
coach robbery miss angel was engaged in
dusting off her cigar-case and putting things to
rights when a shadow darkened the doorway
and looking up she saw a stranger standing
upon the threshold
sierra sams double

  it was the man of professed cannibalistic pro-
pensities snodgrass-surnamed the snorter and
since his coming to big vista had been rechris-
tened kittens by some of the local bums who
had challenged him to knock off their hats but
without effect

   gude-mornin mum spoke snodgrass
doffing his battered semblance of what at some
remote period had been a plug hat  this ver
is an all-fired fine morn in neow aint it the
birds aire a-vocalizin in the tree-tops-ther in-
sects aire rironin through sunlit etberialism-
im sufferin fer a smoke be-a-u-tiful morninl
angel flashed an inquiring half-amused glance
at the bullwhacker

   yes it is quite pleasant this morning she
replied

   gorgeous snodgrass declared seeming to
grow more assured and stealing softly along to
the counter how et do sublimity tiier nature
o mortal humanity tew see things joggin along
so durned nice im an eesthtte i am-clar
down to my hearts enamost corner you bet
an  worship naturs manifold wonders but
i also rather luv compressed lead-pencil-sbajed
editions o tobacco an the fact is my financial
status air rather deteriorated at present so 
thought id drap in to iuquisitate ef ye ever
trust

   oh ves-i trust in the all-wioe rovidence
as every one should miss angel replied dust-
ing awav vigorously  thats the safest account
one can run nowadays

   but ye see i referred to the terbcc snod-
grass declared with a grin which his red beard
made ludicrous  dye ever comydate broken-
up pards wi stick baccy on tick

   never angel replied shaking her head

   or just hardly ever so to sptak the bull-
whacker perpetrated evidently believing he had
made a hit

   never angel said again  i pay as i owe
-i never owe good-day sir

   but see hyar protested the snorter  i
aint gone yet i must have a smoke or i shall
kerflummix right heer frum sheer wautiveness
so set out yer dice an show yer angelic quali-
ties

  if you get beat-

   i get nothin

   if i get beat

   youve got ter set up ther best five-bit-ers
your shebang boasts of

  angel smiled

   well i guer-i your assurance deserves a
treat she said reaching for the dice cup and
with one tip spilling five aces upon the counter
snodgrass whistled his surprise

  you be great you be he allowed only
succeeding in turning a full hand

  next time he threw less-three trays and
angel quietly beat it with five fours and re-
stored the box to its place on the shelf

  whereat snodgrass looked blank

  alas alas such is fate he murmured
sadly  i hearn et tell tbet the women war tew
much fer men at gamin and i reckon shem
so

  well i wont let you suffer angel said
amiling  i may need to be befriended some
day myself so stick these in your vest pocket

  and she threw half a dozen good cigars out
upon the counter

  snodgrass gazed at her a moment in evident
astonishment then he picked up the cheroots
with ahand nearly as white as angels own

   gal youre a jewel  he said at the same
time flipping a gold eagle out upon the counter
 thou art an augel fer sure

                    as fair at heart
                    as fair complected

appetizing renown-snodgrass ther snorter
you bet

   well neow pilgrim i beg ter orgy on thet
leetle piut a voice cried and the post-office
immediately afterward bad another occupant

 angel uttered a cry of astonishment and
rubbed her eyes to make sure she saw aright

  the new-comer was an exact counterpart in
every respect of the man who had just tempted
fortune at the dice-box

  snodgrass no  turned around and gazed at
the new-comer in evident anger at the inter-
ference

  hello great yowlin wild-cats what dye
meau he roared

   i mean thet youre a consarned lyin decep-
tion-a consummate counterfeit-a designin
diabolerikal cheat the other cried bristling
up  pm the famous snodgrass the snorter

grass am i ther great original bad-bad double-
steam chested snorter from sorrocco citj you
bet yer bonanzas every day in a week and

  the two men looked at each other something
like a grim smile coming into their eyes

  waal this beats my time no  grunted
scratching his chin

   knocks me clar off my base no  sighed
you aire the cheeriest liar i ever met in my
life pon my cannibalistic honor

   an youre the cussdest lyin fame-stealer i

  i am snodgrass the snorter-you bet

   how ye goin ter prove it

   how are you

  bunno reckon thars no way except to
settle it atwixt ourselves

   thats sure as preachin lets adjourn to
some quiet spot and square up

  im willin wait till i get some cigars
and no  flung a gold eagle upon the counter
took a dozen cigars and the change angel gave
him then the two snodgrasses left the place
and saunt- red down the stage-trail soon disap-
pearing below the level of the great plateau

 angel had followed them to the door and
gazeri after them in curiosity

   well that is the strangest occurrence i ever
heard of she murmured with a puzzled look
 i wonder upon my word which is snodgrass
it is quite evident that one of them is and one
sierra sams double

is not but which is which appears to be a co-
nundrum ha ha strange-strange but i
havent done so bad a trade for a morning start
i wonder if those ten-dollar gold-pieces are good
i scarcely glanced at them

  she went behind the counter and took them
from a bos where she had previously placed
them

e of them was all right
e back of the other one had been ground off
and a picture of a man engraved in tbe place of
the official stamp

  it was a most expert piece of workmanship
and the picture was of a man of handsome face
with mustache imperial long hair and slouch
hat-a man whose appearance was of the type
peculiar to the prairie scout

  angel gazed at the face admiringly

  that settles it she murmured  one of
those man was tbe negative of this likeness in
disguise b it which one true as i live i
dont know which man gave tlis coin

  she tried to rec llect but could not for she
had taken only a quick glauce at either eagle
which had b-jen given her

  oh wall ill keep it and fall in love with
the owner of the face mavbe he will call for
the coin she said aloud with a merry laugh
as she slipped it into her pocket

  a step upon the threshold jmt then caused
her to turn quickly around her cheeks flushing
scarlet

   on mr deering is it you she exclaimed
 you startle i me

  s i pjrceiv deering said advancing
into the rojm every one is liable to be
startled

  an i he laughed sarcastically

  he was a mau of rather heavy build an i
medium stature his dress was tioroughly
 citizen an i faultless as regards fit and tex-
ture his face was a commouplace one of dusky
complexion pu sessin n  particularly attractive
feature his eyes were jetty black as was his
ha if an i hi rather sensual mouth was shaded
by a flerce-looking mustache

  by the way he continued as he saw the
flush deepen upon her faca  who is the owner
of the face whose likeness you just slippel
into your pocket

   it is nob for you to know mr impudence
angel responded  it was not your picture

   oh wasnt it

   well i guess not

   pshaw you are foolish angel to be offish
toward me where iu all big vista can you
find a better man to cling to through life

   big vista is such a great city that i really
dont know the girl rapliel dryly  ive a
wide world though to make my choice
from

  pshaw your position is against you who
do you im lgine would have you a cigar-store
girl but iufatuatei me

 oh my what conceit supposing i
should make an announcement that i was in
the marl et-how many of big vistas pilgrims
do you suppose would come to the fore
deering scowled

  none he said they all know better
than to infringe on my claims

  a man stepped into tbe store just then and
tipped his bat to the angel

  excuse me he said  but could you tell
me where i can find the residence of miss
tabibba green

chapter iv

too many aces

 de wolf deering wheeled around with an
oath at the query of the new-comer and then
added a second one

  the stranger who stood in the doorway was
sierra sam

  or wa it the irish spotter mcnorrin

  these questions went quickly through deer-
ings mind

   oh are you the man sam asked with a
smile  who knows of the residence of miss
green

   i reckon i am what does it concern you
deering demanded savagely

   it concerns me to the extent that i am here
to see this miss green sam replied uuruffled
 if you do not see fit t impart the information
i desire perhaps i can find out elsewhere

   i can tell you- angel began but deering
turned upon her so fiercely that she stopped
speaking

   you shut up he growled or it will be
the worse for you

  then he turned to the sport

   who are you and what do you want with
tahitha greeu be demanded
 emphatically it is none of your business de
wolf deering was the prompt reply i
didnt coma here to make a mau of your stamp
acquainted with my business by any means so
lli bid you good-day

  de wolf deering did not follow him as he
turned and strode away but instead turned to
angel

   you see that galoot he queried noting the
fact that the girl was watching the californians
retreating figure with interest

   i see him to be sure angel replied coldly
 an attractive appearing person

   humph he wont appear so attractive when
he gets through with me cuss him dye know
who he is

  it has just occurred to me the girl nodded
 miss green told me a few days since that her
other nephew was coming here soon and that
she was going to choose between him and your-
self as the heir to her wealth

  she told you this did she deering hissed
his face growing darker than was usual  she
told you this

   she did and i presume likely you will fall
short of the liberal allowance of pocket-money
you have had through being the manager of
her affairs angel answered watching him
with something like a triumphant expression in
her eves

  never never deering gritted his face
flaming with rage  ill teach this puppy
sierra sam that he made a disastrous move
when he came to big vista mark my words
as for you i do believe you would rejoice in my
downfall

  of course with all the angelic zst of my
nature she fired back  i do not admire you
sierra sams double



mr deering-i told you that when i first came
to listen to your would-be- loverly proposals
since then you have made yourself more and
more obnoxious until i assure you i cannot
bear you so please remember this and govern
yourself accordingly

  deering glared at her in evident astonish-
ment it was the first time she had ever ex-
hibited such independence and ruffled temper

  well curse me if i ever expected you to
turn on me in such a way he ejaculated
 but youll find you will lose by it you shall
yet learn to fear and love me at the same time
the day is dawning when it shall become ne-
cessary for me to put on the screws so to
speak and prove thaii my will here in big vista
is law

  he turned then and left the store

  oh you bad wicked man angel said
after be was gone you are a desperado but
youll find you cannot scare me id rather be
your enemy than your friend

  miss tabitha green spinster the owner of
the only paying miues in big vista and the
possessor of other wealth in money bonds etc
resided in a comfortable bouse near the center
of the little town in company with her pet cat
canary poll-parrot and house-plants and with
only one attendant whose color was black and
who filled the position of domestic and mau-of-
all-work

  claud  was his name and be put on airs that
indicated tiis equality with big vistas most im-
portant citizens

  miss green t though in the fifty-sixth year
of single blessedness was rather a shrewd
sociable woman with less of the peevish old-
maid characteristics than might have been ex-
pected of her and she was friendly to all well-
disposed persons

  but although neighbors she had a-plenty she
seldom was seen outside of her home

  during the same forenoon of the day that
witnessed the unpleasant interview between
angel and de wolf deering claudie thrust his
ebony visage in at the door of miss tabitbas
room and showed his ivories in a most ludi-
crous grin

   seuse me missy but dars a man at de do
dat desires to interview de boss ob de house he
said

   a man claudie miss green cried ner-
vously what kind of a man

   white gemman missy-long hair mus-
tache imperial-rglar masher fo snrih

  oh my and i havent got my hair in pa-
pers even miss green murmured smoothing
out her apron and adjusting the ruffled collar
-showt the gentleman in claudie

  the servant retired and soon the same person
who had inquired for miss greens abode at the
post-offir-e entered the room closing the door
behind him

  my deai- aunt he exclaimed stepping for-
ward with outstretced hand you can not
guess bow glad lam to meet you at last-you
whom i have heard so much of and long desired
to meet

   is it possible miss green gasped rising-
can it bpossible that you are really-

  sam slocum you bet the handsome man

exclaimed heartily ive been here several
days and finding out this was your abiding-
place i concluded to drop around and see you
 i aim so glad that you did  have been wish-
ing to see my elder sisters son very much and
miss green shook hands with him and they both
became seated

   so you are sammy are you

   i am in truth and you i see are my mo-
thers much-talked of maiden sister i should
know you by the strong resamblance you bear to
my poor mother

  why indeed bow strange i always heard
people say we bore no resemblance to each
other whatever

   oh possibly in your younger days you may
have not but latterly up to the time of my
mothers decease she looked very much like
you

  ah well perhaps you i see have grown
up to be a strong healthy aud good-looking man
have you any particular trade or profession
sammy

  ob yes iam independent so far as that
is concerned i am a detective and devote my
time to bunting down evil-doers

   indeed i am proud to know you are work-
ing in so good a cause have you seen de wolf
your cousin de wolf is my right-hand man
 yes  have seen him and my impression of
him is hardly favorable i should judge you
needed a left-hopd man to watch the right
what is it possible you do not fancy de
wolf he is a very influential citizen here in
big vista aud has the whole charge of my busi-
ness

  you may regret having confidence in him
the new- nephew said  for my part i do not
take any stock in him and dont care how soon
he knows it

  about the same hour that mis tsreen was en-
tertaining ber visitor we chinge the scene to
big vistas principal saloon over the entrance
to which was a sign bearing the inscription

french fans find

  it was a big barn-like one-storv aflfair of
rough lumber with no floor other than the
rocky level of the plateau upon which the town
was built

  there was the usual complement of chairs and
tables for the devotees of games of chance there
was a bar for the accommodation of the thirsty
and in one corner was a platform where a
vicious-looking italian was employed to grind
out stereotyped strains of music from a nearly
played-outhand-organ-which by the way was
the best music the young camp could afford or
produce the talent not runninir in that direction

  as we enter the saloon we find the occupants
to be a crowd of miners and gamblers the
usual linbitues of places of the kind

  there were but few engaged in games the
majority lounging about here and there smok-
ing and drinking and chatting

  at one table de wolf deering was lounging
idly drummiug on the polished top and allow-
ing his gaze to follow the graceful figure of the
proprietress of the place as she moved about

  sb was a young woman not tar out of her


sierra sams double

teens evidently and possessed of a petite grace-
fully-molded form a fair fascinating face with
eyes and mouth to match and dressed and
looked all too prettily for the position she occu-
pied

  for although no evil reports had ever as-
sailed her she was noted as an expert card-sharp
and successful gambler

  as she sauntered around where deering was
keeping a i eye about the room to see what was
going on he norlderl to her and said

  you seem to be idle this afternoon

   yes no business at all to speak of perhaps
  ou want to play and a musical laugh followed
  er words

   although always unlucky when i play with
you i am not afraid of you he responded
sit down and while you win a v from me i
want to talk with you

   very well you can afford to lose money
but for heavens sake dont refer to your
usual topic of conversation she said seating
herself opposite him and producing a pack of
cards

  you need not worry deering answered
scowling  ive given up loving any one but
myself do you remember that  once did you
a great service fan

   i am not apt to forget it was the reply
and a strange expression soon came over her
face

   i thought you would not he said sig-
nificantly  it was the greatest service i
ever have done auy one and now when in
trouble i believe you would be willing to help
me

   most certainly what is it you want

   well ill tell you you remember i told
you sierra sam was about to come hare and
that there was a prospect that my old aunt
would put him in my place because ive an
idea she has suspicions that i do not deal hon-
estly with ier in regard to the financial man-
agement of the mines

   yes

   well this sierra sam has put in an appear-
ance-not only once but twice

   twice how do you mean

    mean that there are two men in this town
who look precisely alike in every respect and
both i have no doubt will claim to be the orig-
inal sierra sim

   how strange which is right

   that remains to be told there are also two
roughs snodgrass by name who are as exactly
alike as the other two one of these roughs is
real the other i have every reason to believe is
the real sierra sam

   aud you dont know either of these respec-
tive t-vo parties apart

   i do not there is but one man who knows
the two sams apart

   who is that

   junius bratus dunk

  ah then perhaps he can give you the in-
formation you want

   but be will not do so he has a scheme on
foot to fetch forward one of these men as the
rightful heir to a part of the wealth should
tabitha die which string he is working i do
not lqjow he admits no knowledge of either

man or that he is interested in either now i
want to find out which is the genuine sierra
sam my cousiu and i want you to do it for
me and mark him so i will know him then ill
settle the case of who is to be tabitha greens
heir in short order

   how am  to do this

  ill leave that to your womans wit you
find out for me and ill give you five thousand
dollars clear cash you know i am good for it
shi as i live here comes one of the sams

  they went to playing very briskly as sierra
sam came sauntering along his movements
characterized by grace and ease and his face as
handsome as was the usual wont of the famous
frontier ferret

  leisurely along to the table he sauntered and
there paused his hands carelessly locked behind
his hips and a cigar in his mouth

   well what do you want deering growled
looking at him with a savage scowl

   nothing particularly was the composed
answer  except that i observe you have one
more ace of hearts in your hand than is allow-
able in the geueral games of cards

  french fan quickly reached over snatching
the cards from deerings hand and perceived
that the stranger was right

  deering quickly arose whipping a revolver
from bis hip holster

  but he didnt fire 

chapter v

a strange duel

  the next instant there sprung forward a girl-
ish figure clad in semi-inale attireand confronted
the mine superintendent a pair of six-shooters
cocked and leveled in her grasp

   hey hello thar will ye she cried  shoot
this purty feller will ye well i guess not
my names trumps every day in a week and
ill jest hitch outer ther sport hyer as a pard
and stand by him

  cuss ye i what dye mean deering de-
manded  put up your tools and get out of
here or i will soon put you out

  ball whos afraid of you i aint miss
trumps declared emphatically  ive seen a
feller of about your size before and didnt
skeer fer a cent dye want i should locate the
meeting

   dont dare to do it deering hissed ill
see you later in the mean time this tramp
owes me an apology

  and h nod led to sierra sam

   in what way do i owe you an apology pray
sierra sam queried his eyes scanning the face
of deering with a stern gaze

   oh for exposing his exceeding good hand
french fan said laughing

   exactly deering announced with an oath
you sailed in here and lipped into my game
an yeve got to apologize or give me satisfac-
tion dye know who i am

   you are my estimable cousin judging by
your polished manner sam replied with bit-
ter sarcasm

   then ye claim to be sierra sam do you
deering growled

   why of course why not the other in-
dividual is an impostor
sierra sams double



   so you say what does he say

 dont know sir i havent interviewed
him as yet does he claim to be sierra sam
 yes he does an all i want to find out is
which is the genuine ill then make big vista
too hot for him to live in it

   oh i will you why not proceed directly to
business then for i am undoubtedly the genuine
slocum of the sierras

  that remains to be proven yet however
you must apologize to me or fight-take your
choice i never receive an insult wituout re-
taliating you bet

   as your dutiful cousin i must admire your
grit and if necessary accommodate you i
never apologize without strong cause so nomi-
nate your weapons and im ready the sooner
i dispose of you the better show i shall stand of
inheriting aunt tabithas gold mines

   youll never get em nor the other feller
either deering growled  i do not cars to
have an open and disgraceful public fight witb
you sir but i see that it is necessary

   positively so sierra sam assured  i
havent bad a good square row in over a month
and rather do for you than most any man i
know a pretty good way to settle is to get
up on top of the house-ridge and engage iu a
fist combat-the man who gets tumbled off tbe
roof to be considered the satisfied man how
does that strike you

   good fer yer youre a brick and im
your pard through thick and thin cried
trumps taking her place beside the sport
 what dye say serious-cant i have that
honor

   well that remains for you to say as i am
not personally forming partnerships nowadays
sam responded

   kent help that sammy im a lone or-
phan thout any big brother an ive got to
cling to some one so id just as lief take you as
any one else i aint afeard to sass or shute
the biggest rough that ever walked an when it
comes to counterplotting agin sich fellers as de
wolf deering im thar 

   well use your own judgment about your
actions and look out you dont get the rival
sons of the sierras mixed up now cousin
what say 

  you have the choice-we will adopt your
plan deering answered  i am glad to have
so good a chance ta make an exhibition of you
meet me on the roof of this place half an hour
hence

   kerect sierra sam assented as the super-
intendent of miss tabitha greens mines leftthe
saloon

  the excitement now began to ripen a duel
and especially one of such a peculiar character
was not an every-day occurrence in big vistas
little out-of-tbe-way camp

  it had already leaked out pretty generally
concerning the two sierra sams aiid the object
which brought them to big vista consequently
there was a growing curiosity among the citi-
zens to know who really was miss tabitha
greens nephew and how the matter was des-
tined to end

as soon as deering was gone french fan
walked over to a quiet part of the room and

motioned sierra sam to follow her which he
did in some surprise

   did you wish to speak to me he interro-
gated watching her inquiringly

  yes i do she replied i want you to
take me into your confidence and tell me for
true and honest if you are tbe real sierra sam

   i claim to be tbe original sierra sam-
otherwise sam slocum the other man claims
likewise and it remains to be seen which is
right further i have nothing to say on the
subject for the benefit of any one who may
have designs to accomplish when the time
comes one of us will undoubtedly come in as
successor of de wolf deering

  well i hope you will win privately be-
tween you and me de wolf deering ought to bo
removed and if you wont a missing link to ac-
complish such an event apply to me and-
baps i can supply it

 you

   yes i know it is rather natural you should
regard me as a suspicious person owing to my
position here but in time you will change
your estimation and know that french fan has
a womans heart a womans wit and a womans
honor

   your position here need not necessarily con-
demn you sam declared  i have known very
estimable women to run places of this kind
you will excuse me i trust while i prepare for
the aerial meeting

  certainly but will you for a moment be-
fore you go allow me to offer you a friends ad-
vice first look out for the fresh young woman
who declares her intention of becoming your
 pard shakes are numerous in the mountains
wet seasons also look out for another certain
pretty young lady in this place whom you may
meet although fair to outward viewtake my
word for it you will find her far from being aii
angel

 thank you i will bear your advice in
mind sam answered bowing himself away to
fulfill his engagement

  tbe street in front of the find was already
crowded with miners citizens and roughs the
news of the house-top duei having already
spread throughout the camp

  deering was waiting in readiness having
stripped to tbe waist

  he was a powerfully-built man of exceeding
muscular development and showed off to
advantage and was surrounded by a crowd of
his admirers

 sierra sam surveyed him with a cynical
smile

  a ladder was provided and the two men
clambered up to the steep roof of french fans
find after which the ladder was taken away

  they soon gained standing positions upon tbe
ridge facing each other and made a somewhat
novel picture considering the circumstances

  at least so it appeared to the spectators of
whom the crowd below did not form the en-
tirety

  in front of miss greens shanty stood sierra
sam no  and the ancient maiden indy herself

  you see it is as i told you no  was
saving  this fellow who looks like me is a
ruffian and hearing cf me undoubtedly comes


sierra sams double

to dispute my right as being your nephew
thereby thinking to have me ousted and estab-
lish himself with a view to the future-some-
thing i never even consider

  in front of the  post-offije stood miss angel
ani a very superannuated individual of cadav-
erous countenance by the name of junius bru-
tus dunk

  ohl mr dunk are they really going to
fight pretty miss angel asked anxiously

   yes-you see for yourself the fellow
went into fans and insulted deering and he
challenged him to fight if i am not mistaken
mr sam will gpt his fill

   pshaw i dont believe it mr dunk which
is the real sierra sam

  the lean man smiled

   if i know its my secret till i make a spec
out of it s  pg as all other eyes can discover
no difference between them im sure i am not
going to expose tbe impostor for nothing

   you are a bad man mr dunk

  pooh no

   then tell me this which man are you put-
ting forward-the right or wrong

   ask the winds- not me watch the acting
-for it must be acting on the part of one if
you find out ill treat ah look-they strike
a professional attitude now theyll git down
to business directly

  they began sparring-that is to say care-
fully feeling each other

  deering wis dark aud sinister in appearance-
a malicious vengeful light burning in his eyes

  sierra sam was calm and calculating a faint
expression of reckless confidence upon his hand-
some face

  he wore his boots while deering was in his
stocking feet which gave him a decided advan-
tage upon the slippery roof

  deering rushed forward and grasped sam
around the waist and attempted to hurl him
from the roof but failed

  toe californian tore loose his opponents
grasp with a powerful effort-then with a sud-
den movement which astonished the spectators
and caused them to hold their breath he raised
deering bodily in his arms as though he had
ben an infant and dashed along the roof

  at the middle of the ridge was a largo chim-
ney with a cavernous opening which com-
municated with a large open fire-place in the
sal on beow

  straight to this chimney the dare-devil cali-
fornian bore his victim-an instant later de-
spite his m st desporate efforts deering was
raised and chucked down the chimney head-
foremost

  while sierra sam sprung into tbe air turned
a double somerset and landed safely upon his
feet on tbe ground among the crowd

   was it done fair gents he demanded a
moment later with the utmost coolness

  the majority of the crowd gave a yell of as-
sent

  deering emerged from the saloon at this junc-
ture a sorry-looking wreck of humanity

  he was black from top to toe with soot his
left arm bung limp and useless by bis side the
hair was nearly singed off his head and his face
somewhat burned

  there chanced to be a small fire in the fire-
place at this time which had done the latter
mischief

  where is sierra sam he roared as the
crowd gazed at him

  ay where was sierra sam

  the crowd looked around among themselves
and echoed the query for as if by magic had
the californian mysteriously disappeared

    	chapter vi

the strike

  yes the son of the sierras who had been th
cause of de wolf deerings woeful plight had
as completely and mysteriously vanished from
view as if the earth had opened and swallowed
him

  but he had not flown to escape deering by
any means for he stepped out of the  find 
an instant later a smile upon his face

   well cuz how do you feel sorry to see
you have fared so badly he said surveying the
discomfited villain laughingly

   curse you ill get even with vou for this
deering responded savagely your life-blood
shall pay for tbe insult mark my word

  then having delivered himself of the threat
be turned and limped away toward bis shanty
followed by a laugh from the crowd

  he heard the laugh and turned to shake hi
fist back at bis tormentors

   well pay for that laugh one miner said
dubiously

   how do you mean nnother demanded

  ye remember we laffed at him once afore
an he cut flown our wages twenty-five cents on
tbe dollar

   bah lie dassent do it now ties got reason
to go slow now and the speaker cast a glance
at sierra sam no 

   keut help that-dont believe itll hinder
his spite jest you watch out fer a sign at the
office o twenty-five per cent reduction

   durn my skin if ill stand it

   nor i put in one of the oldest gang-bosses
in big vista  were working fer low wages
now why the mr-n up at flumeville aire
gittin more than us since we were cut down
on course assented another ani tell
ye what i dont believe old tabitha knows a
thing about the former cut et jest strikes me
that deering is putting tbe  cut  money in his
own pocket

   sb better not let the boss beer o tbes sus-
picions added still another miner he is
powerful ye know an things generally goes
ther way he wants

   taint goin ter be so alius old stockton
the veteran gang-boss grunted  right yon-
der ter my notion stands tbe kerect sam
slocum an if he be tber genvwine lies a man
every inch o him an id not hesitate ter foiler
his lead

  the speech had a powerful effpct on the little
knot of miners who were discussing the prob-
able turn of de wolf deerings anger and they
eyed sierra sam curiously as the graceful
sport leaned against one corner of the saloon
smoking

   ye think thats the geny wine do you 
miner named durham asked
sierra sams double

is

   in truth i do stockton protested ive
eerd o this sierra sam afore an this feller
suits the description to a dot-cool as a cucum-
ber and handsome as a hercules and brave to
a fault

   but hev ye seen tother fellert
-yas tbar he is over at old tabithas now
t-tryin ter git in his work of establishin bim-
eelf afore this chap offers any opposition

   do the two look alike

   alike as two peas  cant tell em apart as
iar as looks is concerned stockton replied

   then why not murk this feller byar we
may want to use him

  lhe idea seemed to strike the group favor-
ably-all except stockton who shook bis head
grimly

   thet wont do byees fer ets dangerous ter
fool around him jest wait ef devil deering
lowers wages i fer one o ye will strike-then it
will be time enough to call upon him

  the opportunity to strike came as one of the
miners bad prophesied

  deering went from the saloon first of all to
the superintendents office of which be bad con-
trol and soon after a placard was tacked by
him on tbe outside of the door after which be
betook himself to bis cabin to make some re-
pairs in bis appearance

  stockton and several other miners as soon
as they discovered the placard went over to
tbe office which was situated in one end of
the ore-mill aud perused the notice with lively
interest

  this is what they read

notice

   on and after this date all tbe men employed in
the interests of tabitha green as miners millers
bullwhackers and operatives will be subject to a
reduction in wages of twenty-five per cent of
former prices

                     de wolf deering supt

  tbar didnt i tell ye exclaimed drake
the man who had first forewarned the result of
tbe crowds laugh at deerings expense  ye
see et war jest as i told ye dont ye

   yas anets enulf old stoclton growled
 ther durned tyrant wont make his game
work hurra lets canvass ther town and see
how many will strike fer better wages

  it was a thrilling hour

  tbe canvass was actively begun and men
hurried to and fro excitedly

  the news of the reduction was carried into
the shafts where tbe day gang were at work
and two-thirds of the number immediately quit
work shouldered their tools and trudged up tbe
drifts into the town

  by the time night had fairly dawned over
the cloud city and tbe moonlight bad beautified
the rough natural vistas that stretched away to
the eastward the single street was crowded
with an angry populace and every mouth
helped to make greater the babel of discussion

  sierra sam no  happened along about this
time near miss angels cigar store and found
that pretty personage standing in the doorway
surveying the assembling of the populace with
a face expiessive of anxious surprise

  oh sir she exclaimed as she saw tbe 

californian  will you be so kind as to tell me
what is the matter

   certainly there is a strike impending i
believe because deering the superintendent
has reduced wages sam replied not particu-
larly sorry that she had given him an opportu-
nity to pause in his stroll

  ob bow mean cried angel it is just
a sbame tbe miners of big vista are not get-
ting nearly so much as those of fjumeville as it
is without this second reduction

  so i am aware sam assented  it seems
like tyranny on tbe part of deering to try iand
grind his employees down in order that be may
personally pocket tbe more

  oh thats bis lay-out every day in a
week the girl averred  tbe strike is apt to
help you is it not the men ill naturally
want a leader and who is more desirable than
the future heir of aunt tab

  humph you remember there are two
heirs apparentlv-perhaps it would be better to
say three candidates

  pooh let every one have their own opin-
ion-i have mine have a cigar

  and miss angel stepped briskly into tbe
store behind tbe counter and set forth a box of
beinas

  for sam to have refused would have been
ungentlemanly and besides be was quite enam-
ored of tbe pretty postmistress already

  she put him much in mind of cnpitola a
former flame who bad lost berself from him
somewhere in the broad west and  ft a tinge
of regret to gtiaw away at bis licart-strings

  i think you will find those very pleasant
cigars angel chatted on do you think the
strike will last long

   i do not anticipate any protracted dif-
ficulty sam answered probably the men
will be set to work again by miss greens or-
ders

   ah why do you not call her aunty and
angel laughed rather inquiringly

  oh time enough for that when she recog-
nizes me as her beloved nephew sammy he
assumed dryly  at the present time my
rival seems to have the advantage grip by
having got into tbe graces of tbe much-coveted
maiden aunt it may signify that im left-
again it may not

  at this juncture old stockton the gang-boss
thrust his head in at the door

   i say cap dye mind givin me a private
grip on yer ear fer a minnit or two he asked

  well providing youll not decapitate my
organ of hearing i dont know that i can ob-
ject sam returned with a smile

  then nodding to angel and giving her an ad-
miring glance he followed the old miner out
into the moonlight

  not far away a little group of a dozen miners
were evidently waiting for them but stockton
stopped before he reached them

   now see hyar boss he said  i spose
youre knowin to deerjngs spite on uscase we
iaffed at his predicament waal has gone and
cut us down on wages dye call that right
considerin

   certainly not sam replied

  thats jest our notion an thar 
  

sierra sams double

us wat aint a-goin ter stand it weve thar-
fore struck for higher wages an we want a
captin youre ther chap who orter hev charge
in deerings place an were willin ter back you
through

   you take too much stock in an utter stran-
ger you have no surety but what im an im-
postor sam suggested

   ill stake my life that youre the real sierra
sam anther boys is all o my thinkin the
veteran declared  an so were anxious ter
hev ye lead us weve sent to deering demand-
ing our back pay an ef ye join us were goiu
ter notify old tab thet she kin get a new super-
intendent or we wont go to work at auy
terms

   have the whole of the miners joined in this
movemeut

   no thars a lot on em-mostly roughs
who swar theyll stand by deering through
thick and thin sa its about tie who will go to
work aud who wont deerings men aire chaps
who hold ther softest snaps so fur as work is
concerned

  sierra sam was silent a few moments he was
evidently considering matters

   well i dont know as i can refuse you
since you have chosen me as your leader he
said  but i want you to understand onething
-you must not kick if it is proven that i am
not the genuine sierra sam

  nary a kick ill vouch every man will
stand by ye like a brother fer were all satisfied
youre the genuine an no sorter proof wont
convince us otherwise etll go ard wi big
vista ef ye aint given a fair shake or my
name aint old sturnp stockton

  when all were collected there was indeed a
motley assemblage in which was represented
many types of the humau couutenance

  sam looked them all over from his position up-
on a little elevation or knoll above them-noted
each face and memorizjd its lineaments aud
character line then turnei to old stockton

   these are the men mr stockton who have
seen fit to bestow upon me the honor of being
their leader he asked

  stockton had no need to answer the crowd
gave vent to a hearty shout of assent that sig-
nalized their acceptance

   yas thems the lads an i opine theyre all
as good as old tabitha greens gold stockton
answered proudly

   i am sure of that and proud to have the
honor of commanding you gentlemen in a just
cause-that of a revolt against tyranny the
californian said  aud to handle this case in a
careful and judicious manner boys it becomes
us to act as one person all together and as bro-
thers we must form our plans aud fulfill them
but before any plans are formed does it not be-
hoove us to make sure there are no enemies
among us who will profit by our conference

chapter vii

sam axd tabitha

  it was something that probably few of the
strikers would have thought of

   youre right old stock con announced jest
let me look through ther crowd au ill soon tell
ye ef all present can bs depended upon

  he looked them over one by one and soon
came to the long angular figure of junius bru-
tus dunk

   aha youre heer aire ye the veteran ex-
claimed  yere heer a-tryin ter poke yer
nose into our busiuess aire ye

  oh no i am on a strike too the cadav-
erous man declared

  yas i see ou aire in a horn stockton re-
torted  so am i an ef ye dont dust right
aloug out o this vicinity ill strike ye so hard
ye wont never be able to collect yer bones to-
gether again

   then you wont takeme in

   no we wont

  very well ive no desire to stay where i
am not wanted the villain said and he forth-
with trudged away

  stocktou then finished his inspection of the
crowd and declared that all the rest could be
set down as solid to the interests of the
party

   well then we will proceed to busiuess
sam said  i believe we all understand that i
sierra sam am chosen leader in this move-
meut

  the men gave a hearty  ay

  there could be no doubt of their indorsement
of their choice

   in that case sam pursued  i shall figure
for your welfare alone as i understand it
from stockton you have as a body decided not
to go to work at auy price until miss tabitha
green establishes a new superintendent for her
mines

  you bet thats ther ticket precisely old
stockton declared aud the men echoed his sen
timents

   very well now i reckon the best thing i
can do for yon is to personally visit miss green
in your behalf and lay the matter before her
ive an idea she may be dealt with in this way
but first of all you will have to nominate whom
you want to fill deerings place

  you you shouted stockton

   you of course hurrah fer sierra sam the
original shouted miner durham

  and the others echoed the two speakers choice
clamorously

   no gentlemen  cannot agree to that
sam returned quickly  i have no desire to
crowd myself forward into miss greens affairs
iu this way i propose that your gang-boss
here is tbe proper man to bold the position of
superi ntendent he is evidently a veteran at the
mining business aud with your approval i shall
be srlad to put forward bis name

  the speech hit the rough audience in a tender
spot stockton evidently bad been thought of
but had been ruled out out of deference for the
new captain whom all seemed desirous of hon-
oring with tbe position

  therefore a cheer went up and stockton was
hoisted noon the shoulders of a number of
miners and marched about

  while this was going on sierra sam an-
nounced his intention of visiting aunt tabitha
to see what could lie done with her

  thus the meeting broke up and he took his
way to the green residence	

  sam found her seated iu a comfortable chair
sierra sams double



engaged with crochet work she looked up with
a welcome smile as sam entered seated him-
self and tossed his hat upon the sofa

  well have you been out for a stroll
sammy she asked pleasantly

  yes ive been up to seehow the strike is
progressing

   well how do things look dear

   bad i fear all will not be as well as i first
anticipated it may end in bloodshed for all i
know

   oh dear it is too bad

  yes  think there is only one way to set-
tle it deering is not a favorite with the
majority of tbe men and they swear theyll
not go to work until he is removed and old
stockton put in his place and their wages raised
to flumeville prices so they enlisted me to
come aud lay the facts before you

  you why  thought that they were try-
ing to league themselves with the pretending
sierra sam who abused de wolf

   they elected him their captain because he
believed their demands were just and fair i
am the sierra sam you just referred to as pre-
tending aud i am tbe genuine original sam
slocum too you bet

  miss green fairly gasped with amazement
and rubbed her glasses iu order to get a better
look at him

  do tell she exclaimed why i did
really thiuk you were my nephew sammy who
went out for a stroll

   so i am your nephew sammy but not the
sleek-tongued impostor who has visited you
ahead of me and tried to palm himself off on
you as tbe real samuel slocum

   this is very strange sir how am i to
know which of you is basely deceiving me

   that you must judge for yourself sam
answered  it is a strange fact that we closely
resemble each other and therefore no wonder
that the other man should wish to step into
your shoes when you get ready to step out as
for myself i will have nothing to do with your
affairs further than to prevent you so far as in
my power from fostering a lying humbug
my professional services bring me in sufficient
wealth for my moderate demands and i have
no desire to become your heir-indeed i will
not so please understand that and now
as i came in behalf of the miners please let me
know what you propose to do

   i shall have to hold that matter under care-
ful consideration miss green said rather stiff-
ly this matter of rivalry i shall also con-
sider but i may as well tell you that i have no
faith in your claims the other gentleman
seems the most like my dear dead sisters child
all right suit yourself and you will suit
me sam declared arising the man deer-
ing is a consummate rascal and the sooner
you get rid of him the more riches you will
nave to bestow upon the saml of your choice
then with a bow the californian left the
room leaving the maiden mine-owner to her
own reflections

  later that night-big vista was wrapt in si-
jence

  the street was cleared of its usual throng of

miners the saloons were shut up and slumber
seemed to overhang the mountain town

  but every one slumbered not

  just below the level of the great plateau
woere the town was built and at one side of
the tortuous descending stage trail stood an
old cabin which was partly overgrown with
moss and vines and deserted tho windows
were boarded up and upon th door was nailed
a white board upon which was painted in let-
ters of black the single word

 smalti-pox

  to-night the moons bright rays streamed down
upon the place with rather spectral effect aud
tbe breeze sighed under the eaves of the slab
roof with a lonely sort of moan

  at such an hour human presence could hardly
have been expected in the viciuity yet from
the direction of the town came a black-clad
figure down the trail and paused in front of the
cabin door

  a person of medium stature was this clad
from top to toe in a coarse somber black with
a full black mask upon the face black gloves
upon the hands and a black sombrero upon the
head

  upon the breast of the closely-buttoned coat
was a brass letter  a

  iu front of the cabin paused this figure and
waited

  evidently some one else was expected judg-
ing by his glances up the trail

  soou another man came down the trail and
joined the first one in front of the cabin

  exactly like the first did this second person
look his whole general appearance being the
same except that on his coat was a brass letter
 b

  whats the matter with c to-night a
growled as b came up

  dont know in love i expect was the
laconic answer

  bah theres no time for love affairs now
business before pleasure was the retort

  then silence followed

  c soon made bis appearance from the direc-
tion of big vista and joined the other two then
the door of the cabin was opened and the trio
entered closing the door after them

  a dark place it was but a lantern was soon
produced and lit which lightened up the gloom

  it was all in one room in the center of which
was a table with three stools by it in one cor-
ner was a coffin-shaped box set upon two wooden
horses and the box covered over with a large
somber blanket

  just across the room in another corner stood a
fleshless grinning skeleton

  upon its breast some person had hung a pla-
card which read

i died oi small-pox

  in addition to those uninviting relics there
was a musty disagreeable odor to the place
which added to its somberness

  the black trio did not appear to be disturbed
by the surroundings however for they took
seats about the table and passed around a small
bottle of wine until each had taken a swallow

   well here we are once more a said after


sferra sams double

the bottle was put away  lets get down to
business

   well go ahead b replied drumming on the
table  ive learned nothing

  nor t c declared

  it is queer a added impatiently the
man we want-the man we came to big vista
to entrap is in the town and yet not in our
power

   because were not certain which he is c
declared spitefully  we each have our sus-
picious aud yet we hate to precipitate matters
on account of the other one-

   see here a spoke up sharply-let us un-
derstand each other c you are in love with
this geuuiue sierra sam-you need not deny
it

   it depends altogether which sam you take
for the original c said

   you know which one i mean a declared 
 so admit the corn

   i am not ashamed to admit that i never
was more impressed with a person c confessed
with a slight lauh  and you are in the same
predicament b

  i am b admitted you had better
confess a similar weakness yoursolf my fair
a

   i do-i never met a man before whom i
could not steel mv heart against so we are all
infatuated with this one man well well this
will not do at all we did not come here to
big vista to become fools we came here to
capture a shark for a reward and thats what
we must do

   correct assented b  but that has noth-
ing to do with love matters we three have got
to divide thats flat or else give up loving and
stick to our vows of allegiance

   who is willing to give in thats the ques-
tion c demanded  not i for one

  nor any of us a responded  i think i
stand the best chance of winning the day

  both c ctnd b laughed sarcastically at this

   if sierra sam were here perhaps he might
be able to decide for himself better than any of
us c suggested taking a sensible view of the
matter

  at this juncture a faint cough was heard

  eavesdroppers cried a and the next in-
stant the trio were uon their feet with cocked
revolvers in their rasp

  a moment later the robe was thrown off the
coffin and sierra sam leaped out upon the
floor

  the weapons of the black trio instantly cov-
ered him and a cried out

   halt you are our prisoner

   is that so was sams rejoinder  judging
by what i have just overheard i couldnt have
fallen into more affectionate hands

   that remains to be seen a retorted stern-
ly you have discovered a part of our secret
aud therefore your mouth must be sealed do
you know what must be done to accomplish this
result

   cant say as i do sam replied

  well ill inform you before you ever
leave this place alive you must marry one of
us here we are-you shall have your choice
is this satisfactory b and c

   those personages nodded assent

  for once saml of the sierras wished the
earth would open up and swallow him or his
trio of admirers 

chapter viii

a blind choice

  sierras habitual composure was nothing
daunted

    well he said with a grim sort of humor
 you seem to have the matter all cut and dried
 among yourselves

    yes we at present have the whip-row and
 it becomes necessary for us to improve it while
 we can if you listen i will explain

   sam nodded his willingness aud so letter a
 continued

    well to begin with you behold in us the
 sisters sarony otherwise the black trio female
 detectives formerly there were four of us but
 the foul hand of a traitor took one off leaving
 but us three bound together by a terrible tie
 to avenge our sisters death if we have to fol-
 low her murderer to the end of the earth our
 unison to be unbroken until the mission is ful-
 filled

   but just now arises a dilemma when we
fancy we have our man safely caught another
of precisely similar appearance comes forward
there are two men in the field we do not know
whicu is our enemy owing to their perfect re-
semblance to each other

    then i suppose i am one of tbe two sam
 remarked unconcernedly

   yes you are the one suspected and accord-
 ing to our oath it would be our duty to see that
 you never saw the open air again-certainly
 not until we were satisfied to a certainty
 whether you were really our man or not but
 now either you must die or become one of us
 by marriage the consummation of which shall
 seal your lips as regards us until you or the
  other man is discovered to be our man

    well then its settled ive got to hitch on to
 one of you

  sam took out and lit a cigar and regarded
the three sisters sarony closely

    one of you is french fan another is trumps
 my declared pard and the other angel of the
 post-office he said finally  now cant you
 tell me which is which so i can choose to my
 own liking

   the black trio shook their heads in concert
 they stood in line facing him now and looked
 as nearlv alike as was possible

    well in that case i suppose i shall have to
 go it blind i dont know one of you from the
 other but on the venture i shall choose c
 there was a moments silence then a ad-
 vanced to the table and took a book from a
 drawer-a small testament

  do you swear by your hope of heaven
sierra sam to keep secret all the knowledge
that has come into your possession to-night and
to take hereby this girl letter c-otherwise
stella sarony-as your lawfullv-wedded wife
and to love cherish protect and support her
a asked solemnly

  i do sam answered resolved to see the
thing through to the end
sierra sams double



  a raised the testament to his lips and then
put out her band

  allow me to congratulate you at the ex-
pense of myself aud sister b she said witb at-
tempted heartiness but with a slight tremor in
her voice  i assuie you that you now have
three pards who will stand by you to the end
unless you should prove to be our man then
love hope and friendship must be crumbed by
the avenging triple-clasped hands of the three
sisters sarony you are at liberty to go sir
 rather yourselves sam returned  as 
have concluded to make this my headquarters
for the present

   oh well such being tbe case we will bid
you good-evening a assented whereupon the
strange trio filed out of tbe cabin

 they departed as they had come a went
first and as soon as she was out of sight b fol-
lowed suit leaving c last

  she turned os soon as her sister bad started
and placed her small gloved hand in the cali-
fornians	

  good-nigbt mr slocum she said earnest-
ly yet in a voice that sam failed to recognize

  if you regret the proceedings of to-night let
me reassure you for except at your own solici-
tation you will never be asked to keep your
promise nor will any of your plans ever be in-
terfered with all i have to say is-your choice
will never bate you

  she turned then and followed the others

   wonaers will never cease the bewildered
detective muttered  saml youre a benedict
at last and dont know who your wife is

 morning dawned at big vista and saw the
street once more alive witb men most all of
whom were strikers

 deerings crowd was also abroad but held
closely together in the vicinity of the mouth of
the drifts or entrance into the mines evidently
determined to keep the strikers away from the
subterranean chambers which yielded gold to
miss tabitha green

 deering was about towu once more he bad
had the bair and beard all shaved off bis head
and face what tbe fire had not burnt off and
carried his arm in a sling therefore he present-
ed a slightly better appearance than when he
emerged from his chimney adventure

  sierra sam arrived in camp sb artly after sun-
rise looking as fresh handsome aud composed
as was usual with him

  he met deering in the find and dropped into
a chair opposite the superintendents seat at a
table

  nice morning sam remarked

 very deering replied with sneering
emphasis

   how about the strike-looks like no work
for the present dont it from sam

   thanks to you yes

 to me pshaw i did not suggest tbe
strike you were the cause i saw tabitha
and i see she is inclined to consider matters

   what at your instigation

   ob no she dont seem to take much stock
in me the other galoot has got the whip row

s	surmise

  deering grinned maliciously

  youll neither of you succeed in displacing
me he growled

  he then arose and took his departure evident-
ly not caring to have any further conference
with his audacious antagonist

 old stockton came into tbe saloon soon
after bis furrowed visage looking rather
gloomy

   ets goin to be fun bymeby he announced
pausing by spin theyre talkin bad on
tother side i heer and propose pitcbin inter
us an drivin us out o town

  let em pitch i reckon tbeyll get their
fill of it sam replied  just tell the boys to
be easy keep their mouths shut and eyes open
and weh see ive an idea i shall learn some
news before long

  stockton departed but sam waited to finish
his cigar before appearing on tbe street

 while thus engaged french fan sauntered
along dusting off the tables as she came -

 a very pleasant morning mr slocum
she accosted not looking directly at him

   very i sam replied emphasizing the word
 an auspicious morning for a newly married
couple to start  a bridal tour eh

 she laughed lightly and a curious flush
came to her cheeks which be could not inter-
pret

   yes indeed she returned  are you con-
templating such a tour

 well-ahem hardly sam responded i
believe it is customary for a man to have a
partner in such trips which i have not

 you are unfortunate she smiled and
passed on

   is that tbe woman i took sam asked him-
self when she was gone  if so shes as care-
ful as a fox about betraying berself most
men would be proud of such a beauty

  after finishing his cigar he went to tbe post-
office where tbe telegraph instrument of the
line running from big vista to flumeville was
located

  to his surprise he found trumps behind the
counter in place of miss angel who was no-
where visible

  hello a new clerk eh the colifornian
interrogated surveying her in some surprise

 you bet this just suits yer pard was
the jolly response  what dye want-shake
for the cigars

  hardly miss sarony sam replied  i
desire to use the telegraph instrument a few
minutes 

  oh do you telegraph well it will cost
you three bits 

  sam sat down at the table and soon had com
munication opened with flumeville tbrough
deakin the operator at tbe other end cf the
line

  theres a strike here sam telegraphed
and sierra sam is at the head of the strikers
do you know if any movement is on foot for a
gang to come here

   one deering has telegraphed offering extra
wages for a hundred men was the reply that
was flashed back

   then please post a placard from me giving
the boys warning that if they come here to re-

glace us they come at the peril of their lives
am instantly wired back  i am sierra sam

  miss tabitha green had a morning caller
that morning whom claudie ushered into her
cosey little sitting-room this visitor was none
other than the reverend obediah potts to
whom reference was made in another chapter
he looked even more sleek and ministerial than
during his ride to big vista on the night of the
stage-coach robbery

   ahl excuse me my dear miss green he
said when he found himself iu the maiden
ladys presence  i presume you do not lecog-
nize me

   no sir i do not though my eyes are not
very good which may make all the difference
miss green answered smoothiug out her apron
and looking very demure

    the loss of ones sight is a sad sad calamity
obediah observed wipiug his own green gog-
gles without taking them off  i know how
to sympathize with you dear miss tabitha
and by the way its many long years since
we last met tabitha up iu the green-crowned
pasture sceres of old vermont

   do tell miss green gasped all in a flutter
you dont mean to tell me you came from
vermont sir

  verily  didst tabitha-right from merino
canter which used to be the abidiug-place of
our early years is it possible you do not
remembar me tabitha doth thy heart not
recall when thy maiden heart once beat against
my ramly young breast-

   ohediah potts can it be possible

   ay all things can be possible tabitha
and the new-comer pressed miss greens by no
means girlish hand with youthful fervor at the
same time hitching his chair closer to hers
long years have passed since you and i
exchanged vows of conafcancy tabitha when
our obdurate parents refused to sanction our
union-but bless my heart tabitha i feel just
as young as i uster did and see you look just
as chirp an l natteral as of yore

  laws sakes obediah you nearly take my
breath away miss green simpered blushiug
red to the roots of her hair  i was just tel i-
ing a young lady friend all about my early
beau not loug ago but dear me i never
expected to have you pop iu ou me in this
way

   well ill tell you tabitha i couldut stay
away ye see im joggin along iu years an
bev laid up a snug sum from my ministerial
labors and have anally come to the conclusion
t was time for me to look around for some
staid party of the opposite sex to help mo
down through the declining walk of life by
accident learning of your whereabouts my
bosom heaved with youthful emotion once
more and says -if tabitha green is alive and
single bless my soul im goiag to set my cap
for her once more

  laws obediah you should remember we
are getting old-

  pudge tabitha sixty years has passed
lightly over both our heads and were liable to
celebrate our fourth-score anniversary be-

angel and sam

  after sierra sam had sent bis warning to
the miners of flumeville he turned to trumps
and gazed at her a moment studyingly for he
knew she had been watching him slyly when
his back was turned

   where is miss angel sam asked buying
a fresh cigar

   oh only off duty for a few hours trumps
replied did you want to see her particu-
larly

   no not at all for that matter i saw sh
was not here and thought it a little odd

   maybe shell be back before a great while
however

   sam left the post-office wondering not p little
what had become of the pretty post-mistress

  about nine oclock in the evening sierra sam
was standing in the doorway of french fans
find looking down the moonlit street where
he saw sierra sam no  coming toward the
saloon

  when he was but-a few yards away miss
angel came along from an opposite direction
her eyes downcast aud paying attention to no
one

  to reach her shanty store she bad to pass
sierra sam no  but seemed to think nothing
wrong although she barely glanced at him

  the rival saml however appeared tc be of a
festive nature anil desirous of making himself
conspicuous for he stepped before miss angel
thereby blockading her passage

   hello pretty he exclaimed  im blamed
if you aint the purtiest gal ive seen in a good
while as sure as my name is slocum give me
a kiss

  and he immediately seized hold of her

  help help angel screamed her words
ringing out thrillingly through the night

  quick as he comprehended the situation
sierra sam no  sprung from the doorway of
the find and rushed to the rescue

  a crowd of miners followed at his heels
ready to see the fun if any there was to be

  by the time the rescuers reached the spot the
handsome ruffian had released angel or rather
she had struggled from his grasp

  sierra sam surveyed the man sternly and
miss greens choice returned the stare in grim
defiance

   miss angel did this individual attempt to
kiss you against your will sam demanded his
eyes flashing

  he did sir-but failed angel replied in-
dignantly

   you may go if you please sam said with
a bow  ill attend to this fellows case my-
self

  angel hurried away evidently glad to escape
and sam turned to his double
sierra sams double



   so thats the sort of a character you are is
it he demanded eying the other sternly
 you insult unprotected ladies do you and
yet claim to be sierra sam

   if it suits you that way yes no  replied
apparently nothing daunted  pray what
business is it to you

  the business of a detective and a gentleman
to watch out for ruffians of your stamp was
sams cutting rejoinder yoir ill-breeding
alone is sufficient evidence  who and what
you are

   i am the genuine sierra sam all the same
and you cant prove it otherwise

   that remains to be seen sam replied
 for the present we have an entirely different
matter on hand you have insulted one of the
most estimable young ladies in big vista and
youve either got to apologize or settle with me

so	take your choice

   i never was known to apologize yet i
doubt if i shall commence at this late stage if
you mean i must figbt with you i also decline
as i am a gentleman aud never fight with any
one

   you are a cowardly cur evidently sam
retorted in disgust  were it not for soil-
ing my hands on you id mop the street with
you

  i am glad you are so fearful the man re-
plied sneeringly but edging away and finally
walking off

  sam turned away followed by the crowd

  if that man is a fair specimen of the real
sierra sam i am ashamed that i am also a
claimant of the title he declared to those
around him

  two days passed without any marked in-
cident the strikers lounged about the town
with evidently  intention of coming to any
terms except their own on the other side the
miners of deerings movement guarded the
entrance to the mines with persistent deter-
mination

  sierra sam no  kept around town making
such observations as he could

  on the evening of the second day succeeding
his encounter with sam no  he called in at
the post-office about an hour after the mail had
arrived

  tbe room was deserted except by angel who
stood behind the counter reading a paper

   good-evening she said with her habitual
winning smile  no mail for you mr slo-
cum

  it isnt my luck to receive much sam re
sponded  guess ive no friends to write to
me

   oh i am sure you could win friendship any-
where mr slocum

   ah then have i won yours

  have you not i believe you overheard
some such an insinuation once upon a time
and she busied herself in rearranging her cigar
boxs to hide the flush upon her cheek

  well ves but i was at a disadvantage
then i didnt know which was which

   nor are you liable to

   then you wont tell me

  	most assuredly not

   i have half a notion to leave this town be-
hind me on that account

   why you made your choice

   so i did but perhaps the wrong one

  ha ha well you must trust to luck for
that

   trust be hanged you aud you alone eould
i ever accept

  he spoke with gieat earnestness his eyes elo-
quently echoed the sentiment his lips had spoken
as they dwelt upon her sunny face

  she colored rather strangely an expression
incomprehensible swept over her face leaving
it a shade whiter than before

   have a cigar she said banding him a box
by way of turning the subject you must ex-
cuse me mr slocum if i command you to say
nothing of the kind again you will remember
you are wronging one of these sisters sarony
and they are bound by a vow of constancy i
know you will be kind enough to oblige all of
us in this matter

   haviug expressed my sentiments i will
oblige you sam responded  by the way did
a curious coiu once come into your possession
if you will lend it to me a few days i will re-
turn it to you

  she took tbe eagle she had received from
snodgrass from the money-drawer and gave it
to him with a smile

   i was going to return it to you when i was
sure who playnd up snodgrass she said

  sam gave her another eagle in exchange
you are absent much of late he said in-
terrogatively when will i see you again

    it will be better if you do not see me at all
perhaps more than as a nodding acquaintance
she answered quite soberly

  i think i comprehend sam said  but i
will answer that i dont quite believe it

   he then lifted bis hat and took his departure
outside the post-office be met old stockton
who had evidently been waiting for him

   deerings down at the  find and he wants
to see ye on important business the veteran
said

  they soon reached the saloon and entered
deering and a few of the roughs who sided
with him were there but the majority of the
crowd was composed of strikers

  deeriug came forward as sam aud stocktow
entered

  ah so ye got through yer courtship eh
he sneered his face most evil and disagreeable
in its expression  i gave you all the chance i
deemed necessary

   you are very obliging sam retorted with
sarcasm what may your highness want of
me

   yes i opine f kin accommodate you deer-
ing growled  the boys an i have been talk-
ing matters up and weve come to the conclu-
sion thet this hyar strike is money out of our
pockets and there aint no use o puttin up with
it any longer so weve jest sent down to flume-
villefer another gang omen who aire on the
way tharfore as there is no further use fer
you an yer strikers yeve got to clear out o
bis vista and make room for tbe new g 
we have have we how are you going to
accomplish our evacuation sam returned
	sierra sams double

 - --------- i-i    ---------- -  	-

     youll find out i give ye jest till sunrise
  to morrow to get your men out of big vista
  if you dont go well force ye to at the point of
  the revolver and rifle

     we are not in the least afraid of you sam
  replied  and to illustrate ill give you just five
  minutes for you and your handsome confeder-
  ates to get oixt of this place take my word for
  it-if you dout improve the opportunity you
  will nevjr get another my noble cousin

   a tremendous hurrah followed from the
 strikers aud revolvers were drawn on every
 baud

   deering saw nothing but grim earnestness
 manifested aud that a row just then would re-
 sult disastrously for his interests so motioning
 to his men he withdrew followed by them

    by sams orders stockton at once assembled
  his men within the saloon

     if they strike before morning we are better
  off here than though we were scattered he ex-
  plained

    have you any objections to my making
- your place a temporary fort he asked of
french fan

     none at all she replied with one of her
  thrilling glances  if i had i fancy i could
  not withstand your plea 

    did she mean it

    or was it only coquetry

chapter x

attack and defeat

    it was well that the strikers of big vista had
  taken refuge in french fans  find for other-
  wise there might have been a worse result of
  that nights affray

    it was about midnight before any demonstra-
  tion was made on the part of deering and his
  gang then old stockton who had been doing
  sentinel duty outside hurriedly entered the
  saloon barring the door after him

     gat ready boyees he cried  ther durned
  skunks aire creepin up on us

     to arras then  sierra sam caused to be
  passed along among the rough audience  if
  you let yourselves be driven out of big vista
  all right  never will if i can help it

    thats the stuff the men cried in a chorus
   and well stand bv ther old camp as long as
  she hoi is together

    ordering all lights put out sam took his posi-
  tion at a loop hole just over the door where be
  could se without being seen

    outi i  the late moon lit up the scene only
  indistinctly giviug things rather a spectral
  aspack

   from his position sam could see that the
 mam body of miners were grouped together
 down the street just out of sure rifle range

    it became quite evident to sam when he saw
  several men crawling toward the  find  from
  equally as many directions eacii armed with a
  bundle of kindling-wood

    it was their idea to qre che saloon and force
  its occupants to come from cover when the re-
  serve force would take advantage of the confu-
  sion to inaugurate a successful attack

     ill check that little game sam decided
  takiug aim at the nearest fire-bug

  just you go tell deering to sail in boldly if
he wants to fight

  bang

  the bullet from the californians rifle grazed
the cheek of the man aud clipped off a part of
his ear causing him to leap to his feet with a
yell of pain and rage and scamper back to a
place of safety

  the others who had been creeping up at once
followed suit

   ready uow at the loops sam cried
here they come all in a body letem fire
first and tben give em fits

  a rush of feet was heard coming down the
street then a small-sized pandemonium of yells
and screeches and oaths followed by a volley
of rifle-shots many of which buist spitefully
through the thin board siding iuto the saloon
but fortunately not harming any one

  with a will did the strikers return the fire
cutting into tbe ranks of the enemy so badly
that they halted falteringly

  out at em sierra sam shouted leaping
from his perch and flinging wide open the door
 nows our chance to show em theyve tackled
the wrong end of the hornet

  the strikers needed no urging

  out into the moonlit night they poured from
tbe saloon with fierce yells aud rushed toward
the enemy firing as they went-sierra sam at
their head

  deering seeing that his men would weaken
before the determined strikers-to save bis own
skin turned and ran for life

  it was all bis crowd wanted-they broke in
wild confusion and also fled precipitately
leaving sierra sam aud his men masters of the
situation

   hurrah lets take the mines while we are
about it old stockton cried excitedly

  no no sam protested  let the mines
alone  if miss green does not see fit to re-
establish you dont touch a thing of hers
just take your time now and ill guarantee all
will come out well if any of you get in actual
need of funds call on saml and you shall have
em-only mind that you have nothing to do
with the mines further than to keep them from
being worked by the other men

  an enthusiastic cheer greeted this speech for
it struck the majority of the men as being
right and those who did not quite believe so
were willing to succumb to tbe ruling opinion

  no further attack was made during the night
and when day dawned once more quiet pre-
vailed in camp though deering ana his men
were discovered housed in tbe breaker

  about noon they ran up a white flag on a
pole which went to say that no further demon-
stration on their part would take place for the

eresent so sam ordered a similar signal shown
ut at the same time warning bis men to be on
tbe lookout against treachery as it was not safe
to put implicit trust in the enemy

  during the remainder of tbe day big vista
once more assumed something of its old appear-
ance the men of both sides commingling upon
the street with no particular hard feeling ap-
parently toward eacu other

  but that a bitterness was ther could not
be doubted and deering felt it the keenest of
sierra sams double



all as he sat in tbe superintendents office and
bitterly cursed tbe ill-luck tbat bad turned his
wn assault back on him

  dunk entered tbe office during tbe afternoon
iust as deering was delivering bimself of a vol-
ley of oaths

  hello whats the matter aire you down-
hearted the skinny man asked dropping into
a chair

   curses be on you yes the superintendent
growled savagely things aire iu a purty
shape when i canc run my cwn town aint
they

  junius brutus laughed rather mockingly

   i am sure no one is to blame but yourself
he said k youd never make half a villain
without me to help yo along by the way
bave you heard the news

   what

   old tabitha has got a lover

  bah you mean the old fossil of a preacher
who calls himself obediah potts

   yes

   humph the old galoot is a lunatic

   nevertheless tabitha and he claim to have
been lovers once upou a time and having met
again theyre going to hitch up in double har-
ness and therell be a new manager for the big
vista mines

  whereat deering swore roundly

   where did you get your information he
growled eying the skinny man sourly

   from my confidential reporter claudie
bah i dont take stock in it theyre both
reedy to put on a shroud instead of wedding-
robes

   dont fool yourself theyre going to be
married and that too before many days
now deering ef you dont look out youre
goin ter lose yer trump in this game

   no ill be banged if  will deering gritted
 why curse me if i dont murder every oiie of
you before ill lose

   you may not bave to do any such bloody
work if you ciime to terms with me i tell you
deering you cant do better than to come down
and ill make you heir of miss tabitha green
and owner of the mines

   and if i dont what then deering sneered

chapter xi

murder

  dunk smiled vaguely at the query

   why then he said  i shall see that you
never inherit one farthing of tabs surplus
cash ill work against you with all my power
aud no doubt sufficient charges can be brought
up agaiust you to make this part of the country
exceedingly unhealthy for yon

   oh you refer to the road do you maybe
you forget you are implicated as well as i
that cannot be proven but there is no
use of our being at swords points you can
just as well come to terms with me and ill put
you onto pvery point whereby you can score a
success you see what a gripe the other sierra
sam has got over the best part of the miners
and you probably know that he is the style of a
chap who is able to look out for number one
it behooves you therefore to see that he is de-
throned

   well curse it whatdo you want to straighten
matters up for me

   five thousand dollars down and five more
when you are established beyond dispute as sole
heir of tabitha green

  deering sat gazing at the floor his face dark
and moody

  finally he arose went to the safe and brought
back a roll of greenbacks which he placed in
dunks hands

  there he growled go ahead now and
see that you make good your promises if you
dont i need not tell you what you will get
dunk smiled blandly as he stored the wealth
away iu a capacious pocket

   well you need have no fear be said  ill
clearly explain so you can understand in the
first place although you may have suspicioned
to tbe contrary my sierra sam is the real
sierra sam and tbe other fellow is an impostor
but sharper than lightning which i cannot say
of my man at any rate the other fellow is
sure to win if left on the market and the re-
mainder of the men will go over to his side and
well get drummed out of town emphatically
te must be removed

  de wolf deering nodded his assent tfris de-
cision harmonized well with his own views

  yes he must be removed but my man
must be put in his place-see in this way no
difference will be suspected and my man will
at my orders arrange everything so the capture
of the strikers can be effected

   good plan

   after the strikers are captured and given
the choice of allegiance or death and tbat mat-
ter is settled something else will be done 
am informed that tabitha green is to have her
will made soon and as a matter of course she
will bave me draw it up and i can easily fix it
so tbat every cent will revert to you although
the real legatee will undoubtedly be his nibs
tbe reverend obediah potts when by chance
tabitha drops away all will come to you my
sierra sam will come up missing and all will be
aw-serene and lovely as a sunflower in june
then you will have cause to thank the great
junius brutus dunk for his efforts in making
you a nabob from a pauper

   curse your impudrnce ill bave you know
that i am no pauper deering fired back  im
not so badly heeled

  well that is your own business not mine
now it remains for you to look tenderly after
your beloved aunts health aud if after a proper
course of medicines you fail to see any improve-
ment but on the contrary see that she is rap-
idly declining you must not take the thing too
badly at heart but be prepared for her drop-
ping off at auy time

   i shall profit by your advice deering said
wiping an imaginary tear from bis eyes  by
t e way how are you going to dispose of sierra
sam

   leave that to my ingenuity i can decoy
and capture him i reckon without much
trouble	

  sierra sam sat in french fans saloon that
night busied in making notes in bis memoran-
dum-book when that perennial bummer snod-
 

sierra sams double

grass entered the place and after looking over
tbe occupants of the room for awhile finally
deposited his anatomy in a chair across the
table from the californian

   waal how dye do snodgrass began
 tew bizzy tew receive a communication
cap

   oh no sam replied putting up his book
 if yon have anything to unburden yourself of
friend snodgrass proceed to business

   waal i allow et aint much i war jest
cornin past the post-offis an tliot id ax fer
mail fer ye as i allowed ye war hyar an so
ther new gal wot tends ter ther offis guv me
this and the suorter drew forth from bis
jacket-pocket a crumpled-up letter

  sam received it and perceived that it was
directed to himself in a feminine band

  with some curiosity he tore off the envelope
and glanced over the inclosed missive

  it ran as follows

sierra sam-

  dear sir-be constantly on your guard but
fear not all will yet be well that is if my efforts
are successful keep quiet and be sure and re-
member that you are expected to remain faithful
to your true  pard  or your own choice io prefer-
ence to all former  pards 

  that was all there was no signature the
writing was neat and pretty

  where di-l you get this snodgrass sam
demanded eying the bullwbacker shrewdly

  at the post-offis snodgrass answered with
an unblushing effort at earnestness  at the
oflls sammy

   well whats your charges for mail service

   waal sammy et aint my natur to be
mean about small matters-so ef ye could make
et four bits durned ef i wont be yer uncle as
long as ther scythe of old time endures contact
wi ther blades o eternal grass

  to rid himself of the bummer sam tossed him
the desired amount and then took leave

  several days elapsed

  the situation iu big vista remained about the
same  nther the strikers nor the anti-striker
doing any work in the mines

  the wedding of miss tabitha green and obe-
diah potts had been postponed a few days but
finally the day for the eveut arrived

  the nuptials were to be celebrated iu the
green mansion and only a selected few bad
been invited to be present yet when the hour
for the ceremony arrived the house was filled
many being present who had received  in-
vitation at all-among them sierra sam the
strikers champion and leader

  about two oclock in the afternoon junius
brutus dunk entered the parlor end thence was
shown into miss greens private sitting-room

  he had a bun lie of legal-looking papers iu bis
hand anlth rough audience at once surmised
that miss grn was going to make some pro-
vision- for tie future iu the way of a will be-
fore she married

  about three oclock the bridal party entered
tbe room headed by the minister and took
their places

  tbe minister then read tbe marriage service
and pronounced obediah potts and tabitha
green man and wife

  scarcely had the benediction been pronounced
when there was a sharp detonating pistol-shot
heard mrs potts gave a quick gasp and would
have fallen had not the minister from vermont
quickly caught her in his arms and supported
her to a couch

  the only medicine-man in big vista was je-
rome stansill aud he was immediately sent for
he was a half-breed but nevertheless bad a fair
education in doctoring

  but when be arrived at the bedside of mrs
potts he at once pronounced her past the power
of human aid

  a short time later she was raised and carried
into another room

  the excitement was intense

  the news of the tragedy at once spread
throughout the town and soon a large crowd
was collected without the shanty and within

  upon every lip was the quesion-who shot
tabitha green

  nobody seemed to know among those wfc
had been present to witness the ceremony

  sierra sam had heard a crash in a pane of
glass-saw miss green stagger as from receipt
of a shot-sprung forward to her side just as
obediah potts caught her in his arms-just as
obediah potts said to him in a low aud not un-
familiar tone

   sh i know the man offer a reward but
do nothin rash until you are further advised

  then with the assistance of a miner he car-
ried the wounded woman from tbe room a
soon as tbe doctor had given her a quick exam-
ination

  sierra sam then turned to tbe crowd which
surged clamorous throughout the room

   ladies aud gentlemen he said in his tones
ever clear and decisive  i pray you to be quiet
and to use discretion a terrible crime has
been committed here in our midst and if you
know who is guilty you are far wiser than i
we came here to witness a ceremony of happi-
ness-instead it proves to be one of sorrow
but in this hour gentlemen it becomes us a
men to look up the man who did the terrible
deed i soeak not to party or faction-i speak
to you all

  the speech was received with manifest ap-
proval on every hand

  inquiries were at once circulated on every
hand but no clew seemed forthcoming except
what sam had received from obediah potts-
and that he was carefnl enough to keep secret

  as soon as he could sierra sam cleared the
parlor of every person except himself stockton
snodgrass and obediah potts and of course
excepting the darky servant clandie

  leaving stockton and snodgrass to see that
no intruders gained entrance sam then entered
the room where miss green the doctor and
obediah potts were

  miss green was nqt insensible-she lay look-
ing frroun  her with a searching glance as if
expecting some one

  tbe doctor sat near at hand looking really
sobr for a man of his evident habits

  obe liah potts sat not far away his head
bowed in his hands and he was weeping

  sierra sam looked at him a second time before
turning to tbe dying woman for it struck him
s erra sams double

s

that to say tbe least there was something pe-
culiar in his manner of weeping

  he then turned to miss green

  she was white there was an expression of
pain upon her face-their glances met almost
instantly

   you are not sammy she said more inter-
rogatively than otherwise

   i am samuel slocum aunt but not the
impostor you are fostering sam replied  ycu
have met with a bad misfortune but we hope
to bring your assassin to light without much
difficulty as your nephew  feel it incumbent
on me to do all for you that lies in my power
so if you have any word to leave-any requests
to make intrust them in my care and it shall
be my most earnest and welcome duty to exe-
cute your wishes to the letter

  she gazed at him a new light seeming to
dawn over her countenance

   i feel-ay i seem to know that you are the
real samuel slocum she said faintly after a
moments study of his manly countenance
you are a far different man from the other
claimant-i can see it clearly now-i feel by in-
stinct that you are the real son of my dead sister
she put forth her hand and sierra sam took
it in his

   dear aunt i have only to tell you honestly
that you are right but i do pray that you
will not favor me i have all of this worlds
igoods that i require to keep me through to the
end of my journey

  i came not to big vista aunt to become
your heir on the contrary i came to solicit you
not to connect me with an legacy you might
make as  do not make a practice of receiving
what i do uot earn but on my arrival here i
found that the fellow who looks like me was
trying to get in a deal to the fore and i
scheduled it as my duty to prevent him if pos-
sible it is no matter of secret to you how well
i have succeeded	w

   i need no further assurance to convince me
who you are mrs potts said earnestly  i
feel that i am going and what is to be done
must be done at once is obediali here

  the vermonter came forward tears rolling
down his fat cheeks from in under his goggles

   i am here tabitha he said taking her
hand  what do you wish dear

   not much obediah you know our mutual
secret and that i am dying i think that all is
coming out well after all i now realize that
this is really my nephew samuel he does not
wish to become my lieir will you when you
are through with my wealth according to tbe
terms of my will leave all to vrhom samuel
may dictate

   i will obediah replied reverently

   samuel have you any choice

   i have if the matter be referred tome sam
replied  do you know a young lady named
angel 

   quite well miss green replied an expres-
sion of pleasure lighting up her pallid fac

   then if it is your desire that i shall name
your heir i will name the woman of my choice
-angel sam said

  and miss green nodded her approval to obe-
diah

chapter xii
obediahs departure

  within an hour after sierra sam named his
choice of heritage tabitha green sunk peace-
fully into that sleep from which there is no
awakening

  befcre she dropped away she whispered a few
words to obediah which he listened to with
strictest attention and as far as sam was able to
judge her communication afforded tbe smooth-
faced reverend geutleman the greatest degree
of satisfaction

  after his services were no longer needed sam
went forth into the town only to find that the
excitement had not abated to any great extent

  a large crowd was gathered about old stock-
ton but they gave a cheer of approval as sierra
sam came up

   shes dead aire she several miners inter-
rogated as the californian came up

  yes she is dead sam replied and i sup-
pose youve not found the murderer yet wbat
residents of the place have not been seen to-
day

   de wolf deering for one-he went down to
flumeville last night stockton answered

   angel aint nowbar ter be found an tother
sierra sam nuther a chinaman importer re-
marked

   gentlemen sierra sam said i have no
doubt but what i can name tbe man who shot
tabitha green de w olf deering would not be
away from big vista on such an occasion with-
out some very important cause come lets
find out if he has been in flumeville

 headed by him and stockton the crowd
tramped over to the post-office aud here sam
sat down at the telegraph instrument and sent
a message to flumeville inquiring if de wolf
deering had been seen there within twenty-four
hours

  after a five minutes wait the answer flashed
back that deering had not been there

  see boys sam said-straws most gener-
ally tell which way the wind blows my ami-
able cousin lias not been in the lower camp-
where has he been couldnt he have slipped
down into the vicinity of my nmiden aunt
shanty in disguise accomplished his purpose
aud slipped away again unobserved

   easy enuff an be war none too good to do
sech a thing neither snodgrass the snorte
declared  why ther durned galoot hes been
a-tryin ter sic me onter serious saml lieer by
offerin me fifty dollars but this great snortin
starm o evei lastin fury wouldnt sic wuth a
cent

  the snorters verdict was indorsed by the
strikers but the remaining part of tbe popula-
tion would listen to no charge against their
leader

  nevertheless sam had a long talk with his
men and ordered placards posted up about the
town offering five hundred dollars reward for
tbe capture of de wolf deering dead or alive

sierra sams double

  toward evening sierra sam dropped into the
find and sought out french fan who was
seated in a retired corner of the room engaged
in reading a novel

  she pushed a chair forward for him as he ap-
proached with one of her old winning smiles
and remarked

   by the way miss green is dead and you are
neir i suppose

   quite to the contrary i do not aspire to
occupying dead womens shoes i came to ask
you where angel is

   i do not know i have been worrying much
about her strange periods of absence

   on whose account-hers or your own
sam asked scrutinizing her fair face with a
searching stare that brought color to her
cheeks

   as a matter of course on her account she
replied quickly  i have bad fears-

   tnat she w is not remaining true to tho vows
of the sisters sarouy sam interrogated

    well ye so to speak but that is foolish
angel is as constant as either of us i can not
understand where she goes

  perhaps while you aud trumps remain
idle she is working up a case against me
sam laughed  still waters run deep aud so
forth

   it may be that you are our man after all
fan ans vered a strange set expression coming
upon her councenauce  if you are you will
be wise to take advantage of the respite we are
giving you

    am not inclined to take advantage of the
circumstance he replied turning away

  latar that night on his return to the green
residence he was hailed by junius brutus
duuk who stood iu the doorway of his
shanty

  hello come over i want to see you the
skinny mau cried in a loud voice

   but i dont want to see you sam re-
turned striding on  youre mistaken iu the
man 

   not a bit of it dunk shouted after him
i know you apart by the way its all right
see you later

  when sain arrived at the green residence ho
found the parlor occupied by obediah potts
and a strau er who was very busy ut writing

   i am glad you have come the vermonter
said  for i am making necessary arrangements
for m departure from this place mr slocum
mr dale a lawyer whom i have engaged to
make my last will and testament

  the two men acknowledged the introduction
-then dale said

   mr potts i have made out your will i
think according to your directions if you
will listen i will read it to you

  obediah noddei assent and the will was read
the devise making  the young woman of big
 vista know as angel sole heir to all-in-all
 belonging to obediah potts whether real or
 personal property bonds money or claims
 by heritage

   it is all right tbe vermonter said when
he heard it read please call in some dis-
interested parties as witnesses and then i shall
be ready to leave

   what you are not goiugaway mr potts
sierra sam asked in surprise

   ay i am going to bid farewell to this part
of tbe country was tbe sad answer  i have
now nothing to keep me longer here and prefer
to go where  can hide my grief with myself
i hate to see you leave us for citizens of
your stamp are by no meags a drug on the
market bere in big vista

   maybe not sir but i assure you that noth-
ing can tempt me to remain here by the way
sir here is a letter you will oblige me by
delivering to angel after i have taken my
departure

  sam received a sealed envelope and soon after
watched obediah potts mount a newly-pur-
chased burro just outside tbe shanty and ride
away

  a singular personage whom thus far i
have not been able to mak out was sams
verdict as obediah disappeared from view
 by tbe way ill have an excuse for dropping
in at tbe post-office now

  he did drop in awhile later just as trumps
was about to shut up shop

  good-evening parti she accosted in her
jolly way are you going to buy something
do for pitys sake because ive not takeu in a
dollar to-night and tbe boss will think wheo
she gets back that ive been knocking down on
the receipts

   yes ill buy a bunch of cigars if youll
give me a receipt for the pay for them sam
said laughing-but in reality he meant what be
said because be wanted to get a specimen of
her chirography to compare with the note he
had received through suodgrass

  its a bargai a trumps assented seizing a
peucil aud sheet of paper and rapidly writing
out the receipt there you are received of
sierra sam ten bits fot- five cigars signed-
tramps for angel

  sam received the paper with an amused smile

  	tbat will answer i guess he said at the
same time noting that the writing was in no
way similar to that he mentjilly compared it
with  heres your pay by the way where
is the fair postmistress that she appeareth so
seldom

   give it up trumps replied  what mat-
ters it to you anyhow married men should be
careful not to be too iuquisitive about otbr
ladies 

   praps said sam dryly

  just then some one hurriedly passed the door
of the post-office at the same time flinging in a
letter

  sam stooped and picked it up somewhat anx-
ious to know to whom it was addressed

   why it is for me he said tearing it open
there were but a few lines of tbe conteuts
which ran as follows

   mr slocum-t am in trouble will you lend me
a helping hand-help me to solve a mystery come
to the sinall-pox cabin yours evcr angel

trapped

  sierra sams pulse beat faster as he read th-t
note
sierra sams double



   bad news trumps queried observing the
slight flush that came over his face

   well rather guess it can be fixed up all
right he replied bowing himself out of the
place and hurrying up the street

  with his mind busied with thoughts of the
youug postmistress and what could possibly be
the nature of her trouble sam had no suspicion
of treachery

  the letter was written in a fine graceful style
of chirography which could not well have baen
indited by a man unless he was an adept at imi-
tation

  arrived at the old cabin sam opened the
door and stepped within expecting to see angel
in waiting for him

  but in this he was mistaken

  hardly had he stepped his foot upon the rocky
loor within when ne received a mow upon ths
forehead which knocked him clear out of the
cabin

 he was partially stunned but yet knew
enough to realize that he was dragged back into
the shanty and his limbs securely bound with
trong leather straps

 he was also aware that some water was
dashed into his face and was finally able to
open bis eyes with a full sense of consciousness
that a man sat astride his body and was look-
ing steadily down into his face with a pair of
gleaming eyes

  dark though it was in the room sam was not
long in distinguishing the thin sharp features
of junius brutus dunk

 ah so you have come to have you my
riend samithe skinny man chuckled shov-
ing the muzzle of oue of his revolvers in under
the cool blades nose your girl gave you
rather a warm reception didnt she

 rather sam responded i was off my

fuard or youd never have taken me this easy

vhat do you want you rack-a-boues

  just what ive got-you dunk declared
with a satisfied air  i invited you over to
have a chat awhile ago but you were too shy
so i had to bait you by the way dont you
think its about time you let up for awhile and
confine yourself to quiet youve been really
too active since you came to big vista and it
seems to me as though you ought to slack up
and give some other people a show for their
money

   so you concluded to put a damper in me to
shut off my action eh sam queried

   exactly exactly you have too much action
to accord with the way things should go-so it
becomes necessary to temporarily remove you
from the scene of your schemes to more sedate
aud substantial quarters where you will re-
main in durance until i see fit to turn you
loose

   i presume by that you are in the employ of
my amiable cousin deering

 not impossible nor improbable at all
events i have reason to want you out f the
way until i make what money t can-then i
have no further use for you you will like a
gentleman permit me to blindfold you and bind
up your vocabulary-trap in order that you
may not utter any dulcet notes while i trans-
port you hence to your future abiding-place

  sam did not reply he was not the man to
parley unless he saw a fair chance for waking
something out of it and seeing that it was use-
less to  chin  witu a man of dunks caliber he
maintained a grim silence aud allowed the hu-
man cadaver to bind his mouth over with a
strip of blanket and blindfold his eyes with a
similar piece

  dunk then left the shanty and was absent
several minutes wheuhe returned accompanied
by another man

  sam was then raised and carried from the
cabin and bound upon the buck of a mule

  a short conversation ensued between dunk
and his companion after which tbe latter mount-
ed a secoud mule and rode off down the trail
leading the first by a strap

  thus from big vistas hopeful young metropo-
lis was borne away the only man ho was
universally feared and respected-even by those
who turned against him even though they were
too rough and one-sided to acknowledge the
fact

  the following morning was an eventful one
in big vista

  when old stockton arose bright and early he
made a discovery that to him was alarming

  the deering gang was once more guarding
the mouth of the mines-not alone among them-
selves as formerly but reinforced by at least a
hundred men from flumeville

  as quickly and as quietly as possible stock-
ton had his own supporting party aroused aud
gathered within french fans saloon

  here a consultation was held which stockton
had to lead as siena sam was not present and
could not be readily found

  ther durned galootshev got us now unless
we kin do some big schemin ter sarcumvent
em the veteran declared  i tell ye  wish
saml war here anybody seen him

  no one responded

   probably hes skipped out an smuggled in
the flumes ter work agin us oue miner sug-
gested

   no sech a thing stockton denied stoutly
 thet man sam is as square as ther day is long
i tell you

  you bet on ibatl a voice cried out and
sierra sam no  stepped into tbe room smil-
ingly

  a cheer went up from the crowd

  they did not recognize the difference between
him and the original

  stockton i am glad to hear that you enter-
tain so good an opinion of me he said grasping
the veterans hand  by the way i have been
on a little spying expedition in tbe enemys
camp in disguise and while i do not anticipate
any immediate hostile proceeding on their part
it will be well enough to keep our forces under
this present shelter i have no doubt the other
gang will go to work in a day or so with deering
at the fore if any one gains possession of
tabitha greens mines then it will be only by
a superior force of numbers ill speak with
mine host fanny and see if bjr larder will sup-
port us as regards provender

  stocktou watched him narrowly as je walked
j

sierra sams double

over to where fanny was sitting alone appar-
ently absorbed in thought

   well i see youve made my place a fort
again she said looking up with a smile

   yes for a time they ruug in a sly deal
upon us these anti-strikers by importiug some
flumevillians it strikes me fanny that it is
going to be a tough struggle before we get
through-this to you only

  do you think so

  she looked at him curiously as she spoke

   yes  do houestly think so they have
over three men to our one i suspect for they
are expecting still another reinforcement from
flumeville to let this out to the men would
ba disastrous just now and so i must cheer them
on and give them every encouragemeut to
strengthen their bravery i trust you will assist
me

   do you need to ask mr slocum was the
thrilling answer  i think you know full well
that i would do all iu my power for you

  yoa inspire me fanny the false sierra
sam said earnestly  i think i do compre-
hend your nature thoroughly and can read your
heart as though it were my own i know you
are passionate and intense in your loves and
hates fanny i know more-i know that you
love me and i wish you now to know that i also
love you with all the power of my soul and
being only tell me fanny that though the
whole world may pronounce me false and beat
and cheat me at every turn and that though
others and even death may come to claim me
you will remain true to me to tbe last

  she did not reply and kept her flushed joy-
ous face still averted but put forth her hand in
his as her answer

  may our reward be happiness he said in
a low fervent tone  excuse me now please
i must look to the wants of the men and keep
them in good heart have you a jug of whisky
you can sell me i wish to give them all a ra-
tion to put them on nerve

  i will see she said arisiug come with
me mine and her lovinz glance caused even
the heart of the impostor to thrill within him

  she led the way behind the bar and thence
into a small room opening off from that end of
the building

  here were decanters jugs and quarter-barrels
of various kinds of liquor

  sierra s im-as we shall yet call him-selected
a gallon jug of bourbon and tasted of it to sam-
ple its quality

   that will do he said now if you will
be kind enough to bring me a quart of water
and an empty flask i will weaken this as i do
not care to stimulate the men beyond a certain
degree

  fan went back into the bar-room for the flask
and water

  while she was gone the villain emptied a pint
of the liquor through a knot-hole in the floor
and quickly emntiel the contents of a pint-
bottle into the demijohn

  that will settle their hash he mutteied

  alls fair in love or war

  fan ca-n in a moment later

  i guess ill give it to them just as it is but
ill small doses he said smiling  you know

the more bornet-stings to the inch of bug-juice
the better it suits the average western man

  they then went back into the saloon which
contained all tbe strikers

 commencing with old stockton the bogus
sierra sam proceeded to give every man a
liberal drink of the powerfully drugged liquor
and ended by pretending to take a hearty drink
himself but the lightning way in which be suc-
ceeded in slipping it down within his shirt-
bosom showed that be was at least an expert in
the  ways that are dark

  now boys he said business is before us
and i want to distinctly impress upon your
memories that business is busiuess we have a
big odcfs to contend with aud if we hope to win
we must be strodg agile and sharp i will now
leave stockton to get you in fighting trim
while i slip out and tnalce a few more observa-
tions

 the majority of the men grunted forth an
assent but the veteran stockton did not appear
to feel so deeply impressed with the pseudo-
californians speech

   boys he said after sierra sam had left the
saloon  i feel all mixed up and i guess ill go
and sit down awhile and consider

  and he did sit down but it was not five min-
utes ere his eyes were closed and he wus in ob-
livion so far as his surroundings were con-
cerned

  one by one his followers dropped into chairs
or upon the floor as the case might be from
the effects o the drug that had been put in the
liquor

  with a pallid face and stariojr frightened
gaze french fan leaned against her bur and
watched the startling effect of the liquor the
truth of the pseudo sierra sams falsity gradu-
ally dawning upon her

   my god-i have been the tool of a demon in
natures disguise who has taken advantage of
my weakness and gained a point in power that
man was not the real sierra sam

  she sat staring at tbe wreck about her won-
dering what next would follow and yet not
possessed of power to raise a band toward arous-
ing tbe drugged men from their stupor

  once she saw the door of the saloon open and
angel step within-saw her tike a quick com-
prehending glance about-saw her dart out
again and close the door

  then all was quiet again deathly quiet it
seemed- until the door was burst violently
open and de wolf deering with two-score or
more of armed men at his back burst into the
room

   hurrah bovs victory i- nine at last he
yelled leaping forward toward french fan

chapter xiv

the choice of lots

 there was no ne to gainsay deerings cry
of victory except french fan alone but she
not only knew that her voice would be useless
on this occasion but the less she said the better
for her

  come along deering roared to his men
 weve got everything our own way now and
we must improve the advantage bind every
mau hand and foot
sierra sams double



  the job was quickly completed without
awakening the drugged sleepers and they were
shouldered and carried off to the vicinity of the
mouth of the shafts where a camp had been
established for tbe flumeville miners

  french fan watched the proceeding with a
colorless face

  deering approached her with a triumphant
leer upon his sensual face

   well what dye think o matters lie de-
manded with a malicious smile  rather trip-
ped up your calculations didnt it

   not in the least the plan was worked ad-
mirably as i predicted it would when i con-
sented to furnish tbe whisky fanny replied
witli apparent coolness

   you deering gasped

   yes i didnt know that i was a party to
the scheme did you

   no r

  thought not if it hadnt been for me and
trumps and angel your little calculation
wouldnt bave worked at all

  oh i see you ary trying tp crepp around
onto tbe side offering the most protection
deering sneered  well yed better soons i
get matters straightened around sbip-sbape one
of you three girls have got to marry me

  choose me and jil scratch your ugly eyes
out first chance i get fannr assured with a
grimace  i think that i will have the bogus
sierra sam and leave you out in the cold

   in which case the fair angel will do me just
as well and she is much more attractive than
you deeriug retorted as he turned and left
the saloon

  when he and the last of his gang were gone
and she was alone a strange expression came
over the face of the girl as she stood staring
into a mirror behind the bar

   even he twits me of my sisters superior
beauty she murmured knowing that it is an
unwelcome fact to me angel is more beautiful
than i and worst of all sierra sam knows it
while i will give up all on earth i hold dear for
his sake he passes me by to bestow bis affection
upon her oh why is this so

  she bowed her head in her hands and wept
with intense feeling

  the door opened and trumps came into the
saloon seeming to be rather surprised to see the
other giving away to grief

  french fan looked up half-fiercely as if the
intrusion were unwelcome

   what do you want she demanded sharply
dryiug ner tears

   i want you to brace up and be yourself
trumps replied speaking with more sternness
than was usual with her  what is the
matter

   nothing fan flashed back recovering her
composure with an effort

  trumps smiled

   i fancy i comprehend what is the matter
with youshe said knowingly you are weak-
er than i ever supposed but this wont do
you know what yet remains to be done and it
must done at once the time has arrived when
we must smother every hope and desire and
strike the blow we came here to strike get
teady aud come to the abin

  an hour later the three sisters sarony sat at
tbe table in small-pox cabin-noc in their dis-
guise in black but as was their usual appearance
in bie vista

   where is the real sierra sam angel asked
opening the the meeting  he is not in big
vista

   i do not know fan replied  i suppose it
was he who came into the saloon and got the
liquor to treat tbe strikers but awakened to
the cheat when i saw tbe effeet cf the drug

   your customary shrewdness must bave been
love-blinded  angel said with a rather cynical
laugb  i fancy bad it been me i should have
detected tbe cheat by instinct

   you have unusual confidence in yourself
fanny retorted  have you anything to offer
trumps

   yes it is my opinion sierra sam has been
decoyed and captured trumps replied  last
night just before i closed up he came into tbe
store and asked for angel while there some
one flung him in a letter which he opened and
read and then left in a hurry before he left
he dropped this letter for augel into tbe postal-
box and as she finished speaking trumps flung
a letter across tbe table to where augel was
seated

   a love-letter i presume french fan re-
marked sarcastically

   on tbe contrary it is not from sierra sam
at all angel said after opening it  listen

angel of big vista-

    es i eemed lady-when this missive reaches you
all that is earthly of obediah potts will have been
consigned lo the tomb and all property left behind
by me will be yours according to the provisions of
my last will and testament left  the liands of one
lawyer dale and you can errer into the immediate

eossession of your inheritance with the last and
est well-wishes of	obediah potts 

  french fan and trumps uttered exclamations
of surprise

 that means tbat you are heir to tbe big
vista minfc trumps said for i understand
tabitha left everything to the old vermonter
that remains to be seen fan fernarked
 you remember that tbe rascal dunk drew her
will and he is tbe right-hand mau of de wolf
deering it would be easy for him to have some
flaw in tbe will so that obediah would have no
claim through tabitbas death

  you ara right angel asserted  dunk is
an arrant knave aud will play the genie be can
see tbe most money in you can rest assured
we must look him up and get possesion of the
will

   i believe the terms of our mutual agree-
ment apply only to tbe accomplishing of one
object fan suggested rather coldly and per-
sonal matters should not be considered by us as
a sisterhood

  angel flushed

  perhaps you are right she returned calm-
ly  i perceive tbat you are so far forgetting
your oath as to allow jealousy a corner in your
heart therefore i will try not to burden you
with any of my troubles

   stop this will not do trumps commanded
authoritatively  let us remain sisters at leasst
while our mission is unaccomplished i think


sierra sams double

we are all well satisfied which is our roau now
are we not

  both angel and fan assented

  indeed after the bogus sierra sams treach-
ery there could be but little doubt iu the
matter

   mcnorrin as he claimed to be before com-
ing here trumps went ou  is in reality frank
fuller the murderer of our poor dead sister
adele this same frank fuller i also the
man who betrayed the meu of big vista into the
hands of the enemyf

  angel aud fau nodded their assent

  l such being the case it behooves us before
looking up the real sierra sim to secure our
man i believe it was a part of our agreement
that we should all join equally iu the search
and when we found the man we were to draw
lots to determine who should strike the blow of
vengeance

   exactly french fan replied  it but re-
mains now to see who is elected to that honor
lt angel prepare the lots-whoever draws tbe
shortest out of three shall do the last act in the
programme

  angels face paled but she did not hesitate
he knew too well the terms of the vow that
bound them together

  shf arose procured three matches and going
tothe further side of the room oroke them off
iu uneven lengths she then returned to the
table and held the exposed ends toward her
sister

  there they are she said gravely con-
sider what the result of drawing the shortest
must be and make your choice

  trumps drew first choosing the match nearest
to her

  it proved to be the one that had been broken
off near to the center

   you next angel said looking at french
fan

  tbe latter reached forth her fair white hand
with its glittering array of diamond-set rings
and drew one of the sticks

  angel then opened her hand exposing the
length of the other

  fan had drawn the shortest of the three
pieces and was elected to strike the blow that
was to avenge a dead sisters wrongs

  the meeting is adjourned angel said
the vows that have heretofore bound us to-
gether are hereby dissolved

chapter xv

a friend unexpected

  sierra sam was taken to a cave in the
mountains not three miles from big vista

  here his conductor unbound him from the
horse assisted him to dismount removed the
gag from his mouth and the clotb from before
his eyes

  the cave was so dark that at first sam could
hardly distinguish the features of his captor
but when he did he gave vent o au exclama-
tion of surprise

    balbro as i live he cried

   ay bilbro his captor replied though i
am rather ashamed to acknowledge the fact
sierra sam i give you my word of honor i
kue-v not this was you when deering sent me

here with you he told me you were the bogus
instead of the real sierra sam and that he was
working solely for your interests

  indeed sam replied rather sarcastically
 why did you come here to big vista balbro
when i positively warned you men of flume-
ville not to come

   simply because i came to help you sam
and bring the other party to confusion with
such an aim in view i accepted the charge from
the rascal deering of bringing you here

  sam looked at the man steadily and accus-
ingly but on account of the gloom could dis-
cern no particular expression upon his face

   see nere balbro he said iu a sternly sober
tone you remember i did you a service once
 have  ever forgotten it i came into
flumeville one day a wreck of a drunken
loafer rough and wretched you met me and
made me better by exacting a promise from me
to brace up and putting money in my hand
wheu i had none in my pocket i did brace upv
iu some respects aud got work through your
agency and though i am counted a pretty
rough character as such run i have it to say
proudly that i would not harm a hair of your
head for all the wealth big vista boasts

   i believe you balbro so let that subjec
drop what do you propose to do next

   what do you suppose balbro asked  a
frieud in need is a friend indeed but a friend
by act is a frieud intact

  and drawing his inife tbe bummer cut the
californians nouds

   now then n said  back for big vista we
go as i told you before i never forget a kind-
ness and i propose to further prove it all the
men i had brought from flumeville are your
friends as well as mine regardljss of wages or
other influence at the present time very
likely your men through the agency of junius
brutus dunk are in deeriugs power but it
shall not long be so

   lets start for big vista as soon as possible
then said sam

   correct we will start at once but i must
make a detour in order to reach a hidden dis-
guise sj if you choose you can go on ahead
to the vicinity of the town and await my ar-
rival there when we will form plans for the
discomfiture of the other party

  having little doubt but what balbro was true
sierra sam agreed to his proposition and they
soon after left the cave balbro going toward
flumeville and sam shaping his route toward
the town once more

   when i get there now he muttered  mat-
ters will have to be narrowed down

chapter xvi

conclusion

  sierra sam went bade to the vicinity of big
vista to the place that balbro had appointed
it was not far from the small-pox cabin aud
knowing that he had plenty of time sam made
his wav to the cabin to see if some disguises he
had left there had been disturbed

  to bis surprise when he eutered the place he
found snodgrass the snorter there seated com-
fortably with his heels elevated upon the table
and in evident enjoymeut of a cigar
sierra sams double	

 oh is that you sammy he saluted
 come in and take a seat i got a little ahead
of you by a short cut and thought id take a
little rest

   got ahead of me sam asked advancing
and taking a seat opposite the snorter ah
i fancy i get onto the racket

   it is not my fault if you dont saml the
seeming bullwbacker replied  for i am balhro
and likewise the snodgrass you once met in
flumeville aud afterward infringed upon

   by all thats wonderful i am surprised at
this revelation sam declared seating himself
nearer to the mau that he might get a better
view of him in the dim light of the lautern

   i see now that your eyes aud the eyes of
balbro are the same when we left the post-
office once upon a time and agreed that i should
renounce my right to the title of snodgrass j
had no idea i had ever met you except as snod-
grass which character you will acknowledge i
personated with a fair degree of success

   nearly if not quite as good as myself the
original balbro replied  by the way while
you have been improving a roundabout way to
reach this place i have been making some ob-
servations aud i have come to tbe conclusion
that we can profit best for a while by remaining
concealed in this place

  and they did remain concealed in the  lean-
to kitchen-remained there until the three sis-
ters sarony had visited the place and decided
by drawing lots who should be the one of the
black trio to deal the fatal blow to frank ful-
ler the murderer of adele sarony

  when the strange trio were gone sam and
balbro set out for french fans saloon aud
found it deserted except of tbe fair proprietress
who seemed surprised at sight of sam

   why mr slocum how glad i am to see you
back have you been in trouble

  well no not particularly sam replied
 how does the situation stand this morning

   bad fan replied deering and his gang
have possession of the town through having
captured the strikers

  she then went on to explain what is already
known to the reader concerning the drugged
liquor which the bogus sierra sam had admin-
istered to the unsuspecting strikers

   well soon settle the matter now balbro
announced  come slocum and well deal
deering a deal he does not anticipate

  they left the saloon and crossed the plateau
toward the mouth of the mines where the
flumevillians camp bad been pitched and in
whose charge the captured strikers had been
placed

  when they arrived at the scene of the camp
deering made his appearance from the ore-
breaker and strode over to where sam and
balbro had halted

   see here what the deuce are you two loafers
hanging around here for he demanded with
an oath  this town is mine now and ill give
you just about five minutes to clear out of it
and never show up here again

  is it possible sam retorted where do
you get so much authority

  here deering replied waving his hand
triumphantly toward his men aud the flume-

ville recruits  by force of numbers as you
perceive your strikers are my prisoners and
are to be tried and sentenced at my convenience
if you do not want to share their fate get up
and git

   i am sorry to say that i dont scare worth a
cent sam retorted with imperturbable cool-
ness  de wolf deering  am an officer of the
law and demand your surrender in the name
of the law for the murder of tabitha green
who yet lies unburied in her residence

  as be spoke sam stepped forward to grasp
his villainous cousin but was not permitted to
attain bis object

  a dozen of deerings men leaped in front of
him and though be drew a knife and fought
them back fiercely they soon succeeded in over-
powering him and also secured suodgrass

  both were firmly bound to posts in tbe vicin-
ity

   o-hol your authority dont extend very far
deering sneered striding up to sam and smiting
him across the cheek  by all the furies ycull
find youve been taking sides against the wrong
man in this matter and to-night at sunset you
shall receive your trial the same as tbe others
and you need not rack your brains to guess
what your sentence will be i am the one who
holds the trump and you shall  pass 

   maybe not sam replied retaining his com-
posure

  but when sunset came there was no move-
ment toward a trial and sam was removed
from the post and locked up helpless in an
empty shanty

  darkness soon stole over the now grim moun-
tain town and sam lay still and watchful in
his temporary prison rather expecting that it
would not be long ere snodgrass and bis men
would come to his rescue

  the evening was well advanced when the
door was cautiously opened and some one en-
tered the room

  at first sam could not make out who it was
but as soon as the light of a bulls-eye lantern
was turned on he perceived that it was french
fan

  there was an expression of stern resolve upon
her face as she advanced and sam saw to his
astonishment that her right hand clutched a
shining dagger

   hello out on a carving expedition sam
interrogated more merrily than be really felt

   i presume you will find out fan responded
 terry mcnorrin sierra sam or frank ful-
ler whichever you choose to call yourself your
time is up your lease of life has already been
longer than it should be or would have been
but for your strange resemblance to the real
sierra sam do you not know me murderer
i am bijou sarony the one of the three sisters
sarony elected to avenge our sisters death by
killing you

  she raised her weapon aloft and bent forward
toward him

  stop sam cried sharply  i am uot mc-
norrin-i am sam slocum the original strike
me not

   you lie you cannot cheat me now as yn
did when you drugged the miners for my eyea
re uot to be deceived as you murdered my
sierra sams double

sister so shall you die and may god have
mercy on your soul 

  her band flew upward and the blade flashed
through air

  sam quickly rolled over and the weapon was
partly buried in tbe rough floor of the shanty

  french fan uttered a vexed cry and attempt-
ed to jerk forth the weapon but before she could
do so she was seized from behind and dragged
bodily from the shanty

   fool trumps cried in her ear  that is not
your man there he stands now

  she pointed over to tbe open doorway of
dunks shanty

  from where they stood they could see the
outlines of tbe pseudo sierra sam looming up in
tbe doorway

   are you sure fan demauded trembling
all over

 positive trumps asserted you came
hear murdering the real sierra sam

  fan darted away with a strange gasp

  about midnight the door of sierra sams
prison was once more opened and snodgrass
entered

   all right he said cutting sams bonds
 deerings men are all captured and all that
remains is to secure him aud his man dunk

  they left the place and went at once to deer-
ings snanty backed by a crowd of sams re-
leased men and the flumevillians

  deering was not up having turned in for the
night but a few raps brought him to the door
in simply bis shirt aud pants

   hello what meaus this racket he roared
savagely

  it means that you have run to the end of
your rope sam cried springing forward and
dextrously haudcufling the ruffian  this time

i	make sure of you my amiable deering

  what remains necessary to be told of this
story can be given in a few words

  following deering arrest dunk was also
seized aud tabitha greens will was found upon
his person so altered and erased tbat it was
hardly readable and gave everything to deer-

  earing that his life was in peril however
the cadaverous scoundrel made a confession in
which he admitted that obediah potts was the
legatee and also that de wolf deering himself
and the bogus sierra sam had conspired for the
murder of poor tabitha and tbat deering had
committed the crime also that deeriug was at
che head of the gang of road-agents who fre-

quently robbed the stages many of whom were
men under deeriugs employ in the mines

  the confession raised a decided furor of ex-
citement aud for a while mob law threatened
to prevail but through sams influence no
harm was offered the prisoners as he promised
a trial should be given them in the morning

  a search however was made for mcnorrin
and about daybreak he was found dead near
the small-pox cabin

  upon his breast was pinned a paper contain-
ing to sam sufficient explanation of how h
had met his fate

  this paper read

 vengeance is mine	buou sarony

  going back to the find sam found it close
up and upon the door there was a paper pinned
which read

   sierra saji-you will find aletterforyou in th
 post-office

  hoping to see angel sam accordingly took
his way to the post office as soon as it was open
iu tbe morning and found angel preparing for
the days business

   a letter for you she said nodding and
handing him a delicate missive

  he opened it and read

   dear mr slocum -the mission of the three
sisters sarony is fulfilled and iu deference to our
angel whom you chose we have left big yista for-
ever that she may b your pard for life marry
her and believe that our blessings will ever be with
you both	buou and gusbie sarony

  sam handed the letter to angel or stella
and she read it with flushing cheeks and tearful

eyes

   they have left you alone and given you to
me he said will you also give yourself to

me

 with her blushing face hidden upon his
breast she gave him her answer aud it was-

   with all my heart 

  poor tabitha was given a respectable burial
that morning there being a large turnout

  the trial of deering was then had and ne
was convicted of murder in the first degree and
together with his pals a few days later handed
over to the care of a deputy-marshal to be taken
care of

  dunk escaped through his confession and
hurriedly left big vista forever

  later leaving the mines in charge of stock-
ton and snodgrass sam and angel set forth
on their bridal-tour in which the mountain
ferret succeeded in running into very deep
waters
