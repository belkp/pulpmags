chapter i

the british channel autumn bc 

- bireme julius caesars until

        tros captured it and used it
against caesar plunged and rolled
 -j before a westerly gale not ship-
ping much water because tros was at the
helm but swinging her fighting-top like a
pendulum and making her working crew of
british fishermen miserably seasick

  forward on the deck between the citadel
and the bow more than a score of british
gentlemen lay dead a sail spread over them
and a guard of four not so badly wounded
men posted in their honor below in the
dark of the creaking hold the more severely
wounded groaned and grumbled at the
crude surgery of their unwounded friends
whose methods whatever their motives
were abrupt and painful they kept the
rats at bay whatever else

   tros amber eyes heavy with weariness
his great jaw grinding shaking his head at
intervals to throw the black hair from his
eyes steered a course far closer to the coast
of britain than was necessary to make
thames-mouth he had come from the
mouth of the seine and might have stood
nearly due east toward the belgian sands in
order to take full advantage of wind and
tide

   orwic nephew of caswallon king of the
trinobantes disguised like a roman legion-
ary except that he had a mustache and his
fair hair fell to his shoulders swung himself
up from the hold and climbed the poop by
the broken ladder for a minute or two he
leaned overside and vomited then worked
his way hand over hand along the rail
toward tros and pointed at the coast of
britain where the chalk cliffs stood like
ghosts in a gray mystery of drifting fog

  too close he objected a roman

ship-we look like romans if we put in
there theyll- he leaned overside but
managed to control himself- remember
the northmen he went on two long-
ships - ran from us toward pevensey
they  have burned some villages the
next foreign-looking ship that rims for

shelter will-

  he vomited again clinging to the lee rail
tros waited for him to recover and then
gestured toward the opposite coast of gaul
invisible beyond a howlmg waste of gray sea

  i would run in for the sake of the
wounded this cold wind tortures them
better a fight with britons than another
brush with caesar he said grimly but
caesar has had time to reach caritia  by
chariot and put a dozen ships into the water
he has had time to set a dozen traps hell
risk storm and everything to catch and
crucify us twenty of us fit to fight-crew
no good-tom sail-and who is to man the
oars

  but if you hug the shore our own
britons may put out and throw fire into us
said orwic thats what we always try
to do to the northmen

  not in this gale tros answered of
two foes shun the stronger caesar is the
craftiest of romans we have stung him
orwic we have made a mock of him be-
fore his own men we have tricked a pris-
oner out of his camp by forgery and bold-
ness we have made him run he had to
swim for it and i know caesar

  a pity we didnt catch him

  aye i am ashamed tros ground his
teeth and what shall i say to caswallon
who lent me a hundred gentlemen to take
caesar alive half of them dead or wound-
ed-no plunder-nothing to show him but
my fathers corpse for which i must beg
obsequies

  caswallon will remember who wrecked
caesars ships off kent a while ago you
saved britain for us tros caswallon will
not forget that

  but tros smiled sourly it is only
grudges that endure kings memories are
as short as caesars for a friendship

  orwic too weak to argue lay down near
the lee rail hugging himself in his cloak
not long ago he had ridden in triumph to
lunden to announce caesars hurried mid-
night retreat from britain he relished no
more than tros did the prospect of slinking

calais

up thames with nothing to show but a
foreigners corpse to offset more than sixty
dead and wounded gentlemen

  mere seamen would hardly have mat-
tered but by the irony of fate not one of the
twenty hirelings had suffered a scratch ex-
cept when tros and conops hit them with
belaying pins or knife-hilts to stir their
energy in a sense orwic was as much re-
sponsible as tros it was he who had sup-
ported tros first and last he was second-
in-command of the expedition worse
the lunden girls had seen the bireme off
they would be waiting now to kiss victorious
warriors-expecting to see caesar brought
forth from the hold in chains

  instead of caesar in his scarlet cloak they
would see dead and wounded friends-
relations-lovers

  orwic was as young and as imaginative as
the girls who reckoned him the bravest man
in britain

  tros gave the helm to conops his greek
freed-man whose one eye keener than a
gimlet betrayed one sole emotion just then
-curiosity he looked comical in an imita-
tion of a roman tunic with his red greek
seamans cap pulled low over his brow an
impudent nose beneath it and a slit lip
that showed one eye-tooth like a dogs

  to him nothing mattered except that his
master tros was alive and in command
he worshipped tros regarded him young
as he was as the greatest seaman in the
world and seamanship in conops view
was much the greatest of all attributes any
fool could stand or run on dry land but it
called for something superhuman to control
a storm-tossed ship in chartless seas bully a
mutinous crew and make a landfall after
days and nights of beating against head-
winds under a viewless sky

  conops was merely curious to know what
was to happen next he had perfect confi-
dence in tros ability to meet it hardship
meant no more to him than other mens
feelings or opinions his whole interest in
living was to serve tros loyally the one re-
ward he craved a nod from tros maybe a
smile and a word or two of terse ungilded
praise

  keep the wind at the back of your right
ear tros commanded the tide  be
slack in an hour watch for the surf on the
quicksands on your starboard bow keep

  the goodwin sands which in those days were an
island surrounded by shoal-water
prisoners of war

clear of that and follow the tide around the
coast when it starts to make if theres any
trouble with the crew wake me

he went below into the cabin
v w where his fathers body lay on
vwar caesars bed with caesars scarlet

         cloak spread over it and for a
while he stood steadying himself with one
hand on an overhead beam watching the
old mans face that was as calm as if
caesars tortures had never racked the
seventy-year-old limbs the firm proud lip
showing plainly through the white beard
the eyes closed as in sleep the aristocratic
hands folded on the breast

  it was dark in there and easy to imagine
things the body moved a trifle in time to
the ships swaying

  sleep on tros muttered

  he could not imagine his father dead not
even with the corpse before his eyes no
sentiment not much emotion had been lost
between them tros actually loved his
father more that minute than he had ever
done as a prince of samothrace deep in
the inner mysteries old perseus had had
scant respect for the claims of human per-
sonality reckoning himself-as he was
reckoned by the hierarchs-a failure to the
extent that he had married and begotten a
son who might add to the afflictions of the
world he had spared no pains to educate
that son teaching him mastery of fear-
since no man may escape fear but a few
may learn to rise triumphant over it-and
above all seamanship but he had con-
ceded nothing to the claims of mere human
affection

  not once had he tempted tros to take the
vow of an initiate although that was his
hearts desire as tros well understood the
first law of the mysteries forbade the use of
even the slightest influence as between
father and son for instance to induce any
one to become a candidate for initiation
and tros had taken full advantage of that
he felt no impulse to devote himself to
esoteric aims he could not stomach non-
resistance his father had died not cursing
and not blessing caesar who tortured him
but utterly indifferent to caesars crimes
provided his own acts should pass the criti-
cal judgment of his own conscience tros
on the other hand ached for revenge and
determined to have it

  he could not have explained why he

had inherited his fathers passion for fret
will and full responsibility each man for his
own acts he did not question his fathers
right to submit to torture rather than re-
veal to caesar the least hint of what the
secrets of the samothracian and druidic
mysteries really were he would have dofte
the same himself

  nor did he question his fathers right to be
unvindictive he was rather proud of the
old mans conquest over self to the point
where he could suffer torture and not shriek
for vengeance or slaver with sickening meek-
ness he was immensely proud to be the
old mans son

  yet love him in any ordinary sense he
knew he never had done and strangely
enough he hardly hated caesar he was
the enemy of caesar he despised his vices
and admired his genius loathed his cruelty
and liked his gentlemanly wit

  old perseus had been no mans enemy but
all the worlds friend reserving his own
right to be its friend in his own way tros
gloried in being the enemy of caesar of
rome of any man or any power that dared
to come between him and the freedom of
earth and sea that his heart told him was a
free mans heritage

  he fell asleep at once and his dreams were
all of caesar caesar standing on the biremes
bow in the mist at seine-mouth laughing
charmingly sarcastic promising to crucify
him by and by plunging beneath a flight of
arrows into the waves and continuing to
laugh out of a fog-bank while the bireme
pitched over the shoals at river-mouth and
left caesar swimming safely out of reach

  he did not sleep long he heard conops
shout from the poop and sprang out of the
cabin sword in hand ready to deal with
mutiny but there was no mutiny conops
and a dozen britons were staring at a gaul-
ish fishing boat not far astern that looked as
if it had been rebuilt by roman engineers
it was plunging in masses of spray toward
the british coast making for hythe in all
likelihood

  see the way they handle her conops
sneered romans or ill eat my knife-
hilt put about master and lets ram
them did you ever see such landlubbers
cant even quarter the sea straight from
point to point like a plowshare into a field of
turnips there-they swamp

  but the boat was decked and the deck
must have been strong and watertight she
adventure

rose out of a welter of gray sea dismasted
but right aide up and tros could see men
who certainly were romans chopping at
the riggmg with their short swords

  go about and ram them conops urged
again and tros considered that for a
nymiite but he would likely enough lose
vi is own sail if he tried to turn into the wind

  theyll smash on the rocks when the tide
carries them inshore he prophesied and
went below again to make up arrears of
sleep

  he did not wake again until nightfall
when he relieved conops at the helm by
that time the tide had carried them well out
into the north sea the wind backed sud-
denly to the northwest increasing in
strength and he had to heave to

  there were no stars visible no moon
nothing to do but pace the poop to keep
warm judging the drift by the feel of the
wind with the cries of the wounded and the
thought of that gaulish-roman fishing-
boat with her roman crew to haunt and
worry him

  tros tried to persuade himself that the
boat could not be caesars but calcula-
tions made and checked a dozen times
assured him that caesar would have had
time to reach caritia by chariot from seine-
mouth and to send that boat in the teeth of
the gale across the channel in fact he
would have had about two hours to spare
which was ample in which to choose and in-
struct men for his purpose whatever that
might be

          black night on a raging sea was
neither time nor place for shrewd
guessing at caesars newest
strategy but tros did not doubt
it would run true to form and be brilliant
if nothing else to land a dozen romans
openly on the shore of britain would be
madness if they were not killed instantly
they would be held as hostages direct
overtures to caswallon would be laughed
at-caesar would not try any such foolish-
ness as to send messengers to lunden
what then

  caesars notorious luck would probably
throw up his men all living on the beach
or might even cause the mastless boat to
drift into a sheltered cove what then
what then

  even supposing that boat should have
been lost with all hands the fact remained

that caesar was attempting something he
would persist he would send another
boat for what purpose to avenge him-
self on tros undoubtedly but how

  caesar played politics like a game staking
kingdom against kingdom incredibly dar-
ing and swift decisions were the secret of his
campaigns but there was something else
and as tros paced the poop wet to the skin
with spray he tried to analyze what he
knew of caesar knowing he must outguess
him if he hoped to escape the long reach of
his arm

  he tried for a while to imagine himself in
caesars place but that was difficult the
very breath tros breathed was the antithe-
sis of caesars caesar yearned to impose
the roman yoke on all the world tros
burned to see a world of free men in which
each man ruled himself and minded his own
business

  it was that thought presently that gave
him what he thought might be the key
well-bred vain self-seeking rascal though
caesar was there was something splendid
in his method something admirable in his
constancy of purpose and in his ability to
make men serve him in the teeth of suffer-
ing and death what was it in what
way was caesar different from other men

  his vices were unspeakable his treachery
was a byword his extravagance was an in-
sult to the men who died for him and to the
nations from whom he extorted money with
which to bribe romes politicians he had
personal charm but that was not enough
men grow weary of a rogue however suc-
cessful and however personally charming
there was some other secret

  and at last it seemed to tros he had it
rome the glamour of the word rome
the idea of rome as mistress of the world
with all men paying tribute to her-one
law one senate one arbiter of quarrels one
fountain-head of authority a sort of imi-
tation of nature with the fundamental
truth of brotherhood and freedom left out
caesar served his own ends but he served
rome first he might loot rome and make
himself her despot but he would leave her
mistress of the world

  no other people possibly no other man
than caesar had that obsession fixed so
thoroughly in mind that he himself was
almost the idea foreigners might send
their spies to rome and bribe her public
men almost openly but none could set
prisoners of war

roman against roman when romes profit
was in question on the other hand rome
sent spies or openly acknowledged agents
and successfully set tribe against tribe
faction against faction until domestic
strife ensued and rome stepped in and
conquered

  the britons for instance were divided
into petty kingdoms jealous of their own
kings caswallon who had defeated
caesar with tros help and sent him sneak-
ing back to gaul by night had been at his
wits end to raise an army even for that
purpose the half of one british tribe the
atrebates lived in gaul and had accepted
caesars rule under a king of caesars
making

  the iceni traded horses to the men of
kent but fought them between-times and
as far as the other british tribes were con-
cerned they were to all intents and pur-
poses foreigners loosely united by occasion-
al marriages but with no real bond other
than druidism

  the druids taught brotherhood it was
true but that was too easily interpreted to
mean friendship toward foreigners and strife
at home 

  the only enemy the britons really held in
common was the northmen who plundered
the coasts whenever their own harvests
failed or their own young men grew restless
to wed foreign wives but the britons
made friends with the northmen inter-
married with them let prisoners settle in
their midst and absorbed them without
making them feel they were a part of one
united nation

  self-seeking rogue though he was then
caesar was rome to all intents and pur-
poses or so tros argued it britain was a
loosely knitted congeries of tribes without
any central authority governed by chiefs
who were hard put to it to have their own
way suspicious of one another caesar
driven out of britain being caesar would
never rest until he had reversed defeat

  therefore that boat undoubtedly con-
taining romans must be a move in caesars
game a move that would mean nothing else
but an attempt to set britons against
britons since that was all a handful of men
could do in an enemy country

  but caesar never neglected himself or his
own feuds while he spread romes power
abroad he never failed to follow up his

  by the romans called cassivelaunus

threats never neglected to avenge c
sonal defeat he was not only rorri
was caesar

  tros had laughed at him had tricke
prisoner away had fooled him out-guess
him drowned a hundred men and almo
caught caesar himself it was safe then
to wager that coming so swiftly after that
encounter the gale-swept gaulish fishing-
boat in some way was connected with re-
venge on tros

spies might have told a great
deal but caesar was astute enough
in any event to guess how strongly
tros stood in caswallons favor
and successful guile delighted caesar even
more than winning battles

  it was not unreasonable to suppose that
caesar had sent messengers in that boat-no
doubt with expensive presents-to tell tales
that should reach caswallons ears

  as he turned that over in his mind and
calculated how much time the roman mes-
sengers would have for intrigue- supposing
that dismasted boat to have reached the
coast-tros almost made up his mind to
run for the belgian lowlands and seek refuge
there he did not doubt he could make
good friends among the belgae

  all that restrained him was his own pride
he had made a promise to caswallon he
would keep it those young gallants who
had sailed with him-mutinous cockerels-
had their rights their dead should be
buried in british earth

  but he almost wished the gods might re-
lieve him of responsibility by sinking the
bireme in that raging sea that pitched and
rolled her wind across the tide burying
her bow in smothering green water as she
lurched unsteadily to leeward tossing the
wounded about in the hold and shaking her
spar and fighting-top until it was a mystery
why the mast did not go overboard

  the gods-the pantheon of gods he sensed
around him-knew drowning was no envi-
able death but neither was the prospect
anything but vile of groaning wearily up
thames-mouth in a damaged ship with
two-thirds of her complement dead or
wounded their friends expectant of vic-
tory waiting to receive them and a
possibility almost probable that caesars
messengers had already bribed or coz-
ened influential britons into a distrustful
if not an openly hostile frame of mind
adventure

  as quite willing to drown just then
  ed he might go down handsomely
  wic frankly friendly throwing off the
  ickness and gathering strength for an-
  er dive into the hold to tend the wound-
   was aware of tros quandary and did his
  est to encourage him

  lud of lunden is a good god he will
send us an achievement he yelled in tros
ear then swung himself down from the poop
and disappeared in darkness

 achievment tros muttered and
thirty seasick men to wrest it from destiny
we will all do well if we achieve a decent
death

  for the first time in his life he had begun
to think that destiny might be his enemy
and not his friend that csesar the romans
rome might be fortunes favorites and he
and his friends the britons nothing but
grist in the eternal mill

  the wind shrieked through the rigging
bitter cold spray drenched him he had to
cling to the rail and his eyes ached staring
at stark dark seas that pitched the bireme
like a cork

  i will die free i will set others free i
must i burn to live but is it all worth
the burning he wondered

chapter ii

northmen

 another day and another night of
plunging in a confusing sea hove-to
half the time cheating wind and tide by
miracles of seamanship found tros wide-
eyed at the helm and the biremes bow
headed at last into the hump-backed waves
that guarded the thames estuary

  there was no land in sight but there
were sea-birds and a hundred other signs
that gave tros the direction he had run
in the dark before a blustering wind had
caught the tide under him at dawn and was
making the most of it sure he was in mid-
stream and as confident as a homing-pigeon
of his exact position well along into the
thames

  it was cold and the wind bore rain with
it that drenched the autumn air and settled
into banks of blowing mist through which
the watery sun appeared over the stern like
dim discouraged lantern-light the wind
howled through the rigging and the sea
swished through the remnants of the

basket-work that tros had rigged around
the bireme to make her look larger than
she was the great ungainly ram sploshed
in the steep waves like a harpooned
monster and now and then the britons
down in the hold screamed from the tor-
ture of ill-tended wounds

  conops relieved tros at the helm nod-
ding when told to keep in midtide and to
watch for land on the starboard bow there
was a briton at the mast-head one of the
crew of fishermen who had been brought
along to handle the sail but he was afraid
of the souls of the dead gentlemen on deck
and nobody least of all himself had any
confidence in him tros went forward to
lean over the bow and think

  he could not throw off despondency he
began to wonder whether his father had not
been right in saying that a mans delight
in action was no better than the animals
that his brain was only a mass of instincts
magnified and that the soul was the only
part of him worth cultivating

  there lay his father dead contented to
be dead with no mans injury to his dis-
credit having died without regret for un-
attained ambition since he had none of the
ordinary sort his father with all the re-
sources of the mysteries of samothrace to
count on had never owned a house even
the stout ship that caesar had ordered
burned for the copper she contained had
hardly been his property though he had
built her and commanded her he had re-
garded her as a gift to the lords of samo-
thrace at whose behest she had sailed un-
charted seas

  but the father had never ached for action
as the son did tros had the same com-
pelling impulse to uphold the weak and to
defy the strong but he had a more ma-
terial way of doing it he could not see the
sense of talking when a blow well aimed
might break a tyrants head nor was he
totally opposed to tyrants an alert and
generously guided tyranny appealed to him
as something the world needed a tyranny
that should insist with force on freedom

  is there anything more tyrannous than
truth he wondered watching the waves
yield and reappear over the ironshod ram

  even his father had had to admit that a
ship for instance could not be managed
without despotism there had never lived
a sterner ships commander than old
perseus just though he had been and
prisoners of war

self-controlled he was a captain who would
brook no hesitation in obeying orders yet
his father had failed if the loss of his ship
at csesars hands followed by torture and
death were failure

   not even the druids of gaul for whose
encouragement his father had set forth from
samothrace had gained in the least as far
as tros could see and if that was not failure
what was it yet his father had seemed
quite contented with the outcome had died
appearing to believe his failure was success

   had he tros not the same right to be-
lieve this comparative failure against caesar
was good fortune in disguise it was only
comparative failure after all caesar had
had the worst of it twice once he had
wrecked the greater part of caesars fleet
and saved britain from his clutches then
he had thoroughly worsted caesar in the
fight at seine-mouth his father had never
done anything as effective as that

  and yet he tros was miserable and
his father had died contented he tros
had a chest full of caesars gold more money
than most kings saw in a lifetime his father
had never had money enough to do more
than keep a little ship well husbanded

   his father had hardly seemed to suffer
when the ship was burned and her good
resourceful crew were beaten to death before
his eyes by caesars order whereas he tros
who had not witnessed that cruelty had
writhed at the very thought of it and was
sick at heart now because two-score friendly
young britons lay wounded in the hold
was his fathers attitude the right one or
was his or were they both wrong

   why for instance had his father taught
 him swordsmanship if fighting was an in-
 sult to the soul as he contended must a
 man learn how to do things and then re-
 strain himself from doing them if so why
 do anything why preach why eat and
 drink why live what was the use of
 knowing how to sail a ship if action was
 discreditable was war against the ele-
 ments so different from war with men
 should he have let the sea win and have
 drowned too proud to fight

   he thought not he remembered how his
father used to fight the elements there had
been no bolder seaman in the world what
then ought all men to be seamen and
spend life defeating wind and tide the
mere suggestion was ridiculous nine men
out of ten were as utterly incapable of

 seamanship as they were of penetrating t
 inner mysteries and living such a life
 perseus led besides if all did one thing
 who should do the other things that needed
 doing

r f slowly very slowly as he leaned
vwfww over tie kw and watched the
weiu w changing color of the estuary water
tros began to solve the riddle-of

 the universe it seemed to him

   a man is not a man until he feels the
manhood in him he reflected then he
does what he can do

   that seemed to be the whole of it each
to his own profession born leaders in the
van born blacksmiths to the anvil born
adventurers toward the skyline-he for
one-and each man fighting to a finish with
whatever enemy opposed him that enemy
on every battlefield himself no other

   good tros stiffened his huge muscles
and his leonine eyes began to gleam under
the shaggy brows there was dignity in
that warfare purpose and plan sufficient
if one should rule himself so manfully in
every chance-met circumstance that victory
were his within himself no matter what the
outcome

   and now he remembered perseus dying
speech and how the old man had forbid-
den nothing not even the sword but had
prophesied for tros a life of wandering and
many another brush with caesar he and
caesar were to help each other some day

   gods what a prospect

   caesar stood for all that tros loathed
interference with mens liberties imposition
of a foreign yoke by trickery and force of
arms robbery under the cloak of law vice
and violence lies gilded and painted to
resemble truth and he was to help caesar
some day

   he laughed yet he believed in death-
bed prophecies the thought encouraged
him

   if i am to help cassar and he me then
 my time to die is not yet for i will injure
 him with all my might and main until my
 whole mind changes

   he reflected that it takes time for a mans
 inclination to change to that extent

   my will is not the wind he muttered
 i will live long before i befriend caesar

   the wind changed while he thought of it
 veering to the southward blowing all the
 mist toward the northern riverbank until
adventure

at last the sun shone on a strip of dark-
green where the forest touched the tide-mud
and conops cried land-ho from the
poop

  swiftly then that being britain and the
autumn magic went to work on land-and
sea-scape that changed until both wide-
flung riverbanks gleamed in sunlight and
the heaving estuary-bosom frilled itself with
ripples in place of whitecaps on the surface
of the waves

  gray water brightened to steel-blue
stained with brown mud where the tide
poured over shoals and the sea-gulls came
off-shore in thousands to pounce on mussel-
beds before the tide should cover them

  then another hail from conops and tros
returned to the poop his mood changing
with the weather he was already whistling
to himself

  yonder said conops nodding his one
eye staring upriver too much smoke

  mist remarked orwic but the wish
was father to the contradiction

  he had seen that kind of smoke before
had more than one scar to show for it one
did not admit until sure that northmen
might be raiding british homesteads

  smoke tros announced after a minute
he could almost smell it orwic caswal-
lon shall welcome us after all

  orwic shouted a dozen britons came
out of the hold to cluster on the poop and
stare at the smudge on the skyline they
were handsome bluntly spoken youngsters
dressed in plundered roman armor that
made the long hair over their shoulders look
incongruous - easy-mannered gentlemen
who had twice had the best of caesar and
were therefore more than usually ready to
assert their views besides they were no
longer seasick and were annoyed with tros
who had compelled them to obey him but
had failed to capture caesar

  northmen announced one of them
with an air of being able to read smoke on
the skyline as if it were celtic script
those two longships tros refused to fight
the other day have found their way up-
thames its tros fault they have
stolen a march while we plucked his oat-cake
out of caesars fire by lud of lunden we
were fools to trust a foreigner

  aye and lunden burning said an-
other

  but that was nonsense the smoke was
much nearer than lunden

  two longships and only thirty of us fit
to fight

  tros will want to run away again a
third suggested

  conops bared his teeth and orwic who
had led an earlier mutiny to his own distress
made signals but they deferred no more
to orwic than to tros orwic was only
caswallons nephew they were as good as
he and equally entitled to opinions be-
sides as second-in-command orwic was re-
sponsible along with tros for failure to cap-
ture caesar and that added to jealousy was
excuse enough for ignoring his signals

  any man can sail a ship upriver one
of them suggested brazenly

  tros almost brayed astonishment he
had thought he had tamed those cockerels
cold seasickness and battle on the deck
had reduced the hired crew to the condition
of whipped dogs but these young aristocrats
appeared to recover their nerve the mo-
ment they smelt a northman

  it had not yet filtered into tros under-
standing how warfare with the men from
over the north sea was a heritage almost a
privilege a sport in which serfs were the
prizes and women the side-bets to men-
tion northmen near the coast of britain
was like talking wolf to well-trained hounds

  caswallon gave the command of this
ship to tros said orwic standing loyally
by his appointed chief

  whereat they laughed they were in
their own home waters not caswallon him-
self might overrule their free wills each
man thrilled to one and the same impulse
some of the wounded crawled on deck and
learning what the commotion was about
cried out to tros to get after the northmen
instantly hoof hair and teeth

  i too am minded to make the acquain-
tance of these northmen tros remarked
and they grinned although they did not
quite believe him from what they already
knew of him he was too cautious and con-
servative to lead them into the kind of fight
they craved

  we will introduce you a youngster an-
swered twisting his long mustache we
will show you what fighting is

  your tros answered and they all
backed forward along the poop because his
sword was drawn although none saw it
whip out of the sheath with his left hand
he picked up a roman shield

  orwic stand by
prisoners of war

  orwic obeyed tros had beaten him
roundly once and they had pledged their
faith to each other afterward on that sway-
ing poop on the dark sea off the coast of
gaul the other britons began to jeer at
orwic although they chose their words for
he had been first into the sea at caesars
men when the romans invaded britain and
there was none but tros who had ever
beaten him on horse or foot

  silence tros thundered tapping with
his sword-point on the deck 

  one or two laughed but rather feebly
and they all grew still before the rapping
ceased most of them clutching at their
daggers glancing at one another sidewise

  must i teach you young cockerels an-
other lesson lud of lunden how many
arrows have you not a hundred you
squandered arrows against caesar by the bas-
ketful do you think northmen will stand
still to have their throats cut idiots
we know how to fight northmen one
man piped up well show you

  you show me tros thundered

  he took a long stride forward and they
backed away uncomfortably close now to
the poop edge there was no rail there to
lean against

  by lud ill beat the brains out of the
first who speaks again without my leave
he meant it and they knew it who has
anything to say

  his swordblade flickered like a serpents
tongue he seemed able to meet all eyes
simultaneously

  who speaks he repeated but none
answered him

  they could back away no farther to
advance meant instant death to two or
three at any rate and whether or not orwic
should take tros side

  at your hands i have suffered failure
tros went on it carks in me i went for
caesar i bring back dead and wounded
men whose fault is that yours you

disobedient young- by the gods who

grinned when you wasted arrows it shall
be my fault if i fail again now hear me
not a man aboard this bireme shall see
lunden until we beat the northmen first
who questions that

  he paused dramatically but there was
no answer he had stolen their thunder by
threatening to do what they had first pro-
posed like yielding to a wrestlers hold in
order to upset him

  less than a hundred arrows not one
throwing-spear a torn sail two-score
swordsmen fit to stand up you have noth-
ing but me to depend on eat that any

one question it

  you can handle the ship said one of
them

  he seemed afraid to hear his own voice
can i tros voice rang with irony
does any of you question that i will
come no ill-temper tros nobody
doubts your seamanship another man
piped up we have had proof enough of
that

  not proof enough nay by lud of
lunden not yet enough seamanship in-
cludes the art of choking mutiny who
doubts that i command this ship and every
briton in her speak up who doubts it
i will abolish doubt

  caswallon gave you the command that
is all right said one of them only lead
us against the northmen that is all

  lead i will drive you tros retorted
stand out the man who thinks i cant
come on and lets settle the question
what havent i a rival down off my
poop then down you go

  he strode toward them point-first and
they scrambled off the poop in laughter at
their own defeat so tros saw fit to smile
too as they crowded in the waist to hear
the rest of what he had to say

  northmen he laughed pecking at the
planking with his sword-point i will give
you such a bellyful of northmen as you
never dreamed to your benches now out
oars

and they obeyed him they had

promised they would row when
called on they had disobeyed
him more than once and it was
true that they had squandered ammunition
contrary to orders-true that unless he could
think of some expedient they would be help-
less against the two or three hundred men
the northmen probably could muster

  but they also obeyed because it dawned
on them that tros was sick at heart from
having lost so many men without a victory
to show for it and that he was bent on
snatching a revenge from destiny

  thirteen oars aside began to thump in
unison not adding much to the biremes
speed but adding a great deal to the unan-
imity and presently tros added twenty
adventure

more compelling the hired seamen to man
the empty benches taking the helm him-
self leaving conops and orwic free to man
the sheets the wind was falling so that
the sail flapped half of the time but the
tide served and with forty-six oars the head-
way was good enough

  tros did not want to move too fast he
had never fought northmen although cas-
wallon and orwic had told him of their
methods-how they usually landed from
two ships on two sides of a village and
fought their way toward each other burning
as they went to create a panic

  and he knew the british method of op-
posing them by throwing fire into their
ships if they could come alongside and by
cutting down trees in the forest for a ram-
part against them when they landed and
advanced on foot

  the hundred young men he had taken
with him on his venture against caesar con-
stituted practically the whole of caswallons
available fighting force in any sudden emer-
gency excepting lunden which was only
a little place there were no towns from
which to draw levies at a moments notice
british settlements were scattered and
britons disinclined to obey their chief un-
less they saw good and sufficient reason for
it so it would take time to summon an
army and caswallon was probably in des-
perate straits

  it was late in the year for northman
raids but if these were the two ships that
tros had refused to fight in the channel on
his way to attack caesar they might be on
one of their usual plundering expeditions
in which case they would be in force and
with their line of retreat extremely alertly
guarded thirty men would be next to use-
less as an independent force against them
and the only hope would be to reach cas-
wallon somehow and support him

  but it might be that the northmens
home harvests had failed and they were up
to their old game of wintering in britain
doing all the damage within reach in order
to force an armistice and contributions of
supplies in that event they would not be
considering retreat their ships might be
unguarded and it might be possible to come
on them unawares

  it seemed to tros and orwic confirmed
the opinion that the smoke came from both
sides of the river the man at the mast-
head was equally sure of it and those were

his home waters he knew every contour of
the thames

 that might mean that the northmen
were divided one ships crew plundering on
either bank which was likely enough since
it would be good strategy obliging caswal-
lon to divide his own forces and making it
more difficult for him to gather men into
one managable unit the britons were
probably in scattered tens and dozens being
beaten in detail for lack of one directing
mind

  a man does what he can tros reflected
glancing upward at the heavy fighting-top
that might be visible from a long way off
upriver

  he called the man down from the mast-
head then turned to orwic

  you and conops take axes cut the
shrouds on the port side then chop the
mast down

  he called the hired seamen away from
the oars lowered and stowed the sail set ten
of them to hauling on the starboard shrouds
and gave the word to orwic three dozen
ax-strokes and the mast went over with a
crash increasing the damage to the bulwark
done by caesars grapnels swiftly they
chopped away the starboard rigging and
tros sent the seamen below to their oars
again	

  and now said orwic i obeyed you
but i dont know why without a sail how
can we attack two swift ships

  tros was not fond of explanations they
are usually bad for discipline but he con-
ceded something to orwics prompt obedi-
ence which was a novelty to be encouraged

  we should have lost the wind around the
next bend anyhow i would have had to
take men from the oars to man sheets and
braces the northmen are faster we
couldnt have run sail or no sail gather
all the arrows into one basket set that by
the starboard arrow-engine and listen to
me ill kill you if you loose one flight be-
fore i give the word

  he did not dare to use the bull-hide drum
to set time for the rowing for thesound of a
drum carries farther over water than the
thump of oars between the thole-pins he
had to rely on gestures and his voice

  the bireme was in midtide gliding up-
river rapidly the shore was narrowing in on
either hand with shoal-water projecting
nearly into midstream at frequent inter-
vals the smoke of two burning villages a
prisoners of war



dozen miles apart and one on either side of
the river was already diminishing from
brown to gray and the nearest-not two
miles up-river-appeared of the two to be
the more burnt out tros began to whistle
to himself

between the bireme and the
nearest smoke there was a belt of
trees that crept down to the riv-
ers edge on the starboard hand
the trees were lower near the water but
even so now that the mast was gone they
formed an effective screen behind which he
could approach without giving warning be-
cause the deep-water channel followed the
bank closely

  orwic he said quietly your lud of
lunden is a good god and the northmen
are on both sides of the river listen

  a horn-blast and then another rang
through the woods on the starboard hand
they were answered by two more from not
far away

  are those british signals

  no said orwic

  the tide will serve us for an hour how
many arrows have we

  ninety

  save them

  away in the distance from across the
river came the faint sound of several horns
blown simultaneously

  britons asked tros

  northmen

  tros laughed

  caswallon has them checked i take it
they are summoning their friends

  he sent conops to stand below the poop
and signal to the oarsmen to dip slowly
quietly he only needed steerage - way
the tide was carrying the bireme fast
enough perhaps too fast there was noth-
ing but guesswork until they should pass
that belt of trees

  the shoal-mud formed an island nearly
in midriver half submerged and between
that and the land the tide poured in a surg-
ing brown stream there was no room to
maneuver hardly room to have swung a
longship with the aid of anchors a little
higher up beyond the belt of trees the mud-
bank vanished under water and there was
room enough there for a dozen ships to
swing deep enough water almost from bank
to bank the full width of the river tros
tried to form a mental picture of the river-

bank at that point but he had seen it only
once before as he passed it on the outward

journey

  is there a creek just beyond those
trees he asked orwic

  orwic asked the man who had been at
the masthead

  yes a narrow creek fairly deep wa-
ter

  another horn-blast echoed through the
trees it seemed to come from close to the
riverbank and was answered instantly
like the echo to that from away up-river
came a chorus of six horns blown in unison
there began loud shouting from somewhere
just beyond the trees and presently the
unmistakable thump and rattle of oars
being laid in rowlocks a moment later
tros ear caught the steady short stroke of
deep-sea rowing such as men use where the
waves are steep and close together

  now he shouted give way

  there was nothing for it now but speed
if he had the northmen trapped they were
at his mercy if he had guessed wrong then
the bireme was at theirs he beat the bull-
hide drum and bellowed to his fifty rowers

  one two one two one two

  shouts responded from around the tree-
clad corner of the bank shouts and a mighty
splashing as a helmsman tried to swing a
longship in a hurry out of the creek-mouth
bow-first to the tide backing the port oars

  row you britons row tros thun-
dered taking the helm from conops

  he could hear the water boiling off the
biremes ram and in his minds eye he could
see the northmens whole predicament
with no room to maneuver and a strong tide
hitting them beam-on as they left the creek-
mouth he could hear their captain bel-
lowing heard the oar-beat change and knew
the longship was attempting too late to
turn upstream and run from the unseen
enemy

  and it was better than he hoped as the
biremes bow raced past the belt of trees
the longship lay with her nose toward the
midstream mud-bank starboard oars ahead
and port oars backing frantically blue mud
boiling all around her and panic on deck as
a dozen men struggled to hoist the sail to
help her swing she was less than a hun-
dred yards away tros could have sunk
her with that tide under him without
troubling the oars at all

  he beaked her stark amidships as the
adventure

northmen loosed one wild volley of arrows
the iron-shod ram crashed in under the bilge
and rolled her over ripping out fifty feet of
planking from her side the shock of the
collision threw the rowers from the benches
and the bireme swung on the tide with her
stern-post not a dozen feet away from the
edge of the midstream shoal then drifted
up-stream with wreckage trailing from her
bow and the wounded crying that she leaked
in every seam

         tros sent conops below to dis-
cover what the damage really
amounted to and watched the
northmen their longship had
gone under sidewise so that not even her
mast was visible most of her men were
drowning some had struggled to the mud
bank where the yielding mud sucked them
under others trying to make the creek-
mouth were being carried upstream by the
tide not many were swimming strongly
enough to have any prospect of reaching
shore and as if they had been hiding in
fox-holes britons began appearing from
between the trees gathering in excited
groups to cut down the survivors

  the collision opened up her seams i
doubt shell float as far as lunden conops
announced

  how much water has she made yet
  half a cubit master

  orwic take some of the wounded and
man the water-hoist

  so they rigged the trough amidships and
the beam with a bucket at either end that
was the roman ship designers concept of a
pump tros swung the biremes head up-
stream and began to consider that other
smudge of brown smoke half-a-dozen or
more miles away

  now if lud of lunden really is a good
god he remarked to orwic we will catch
another longship on our ugly snout without
wasting a single arrow

  we might pray to lud orwic sug-
gsted

  no said tros the gods depise a
man who prays they help men who make
use of opportunity get below there

  the oarsmen were all leaning overside to
watch the northmen being cut down by
britons as they struggled through the
muddy shallows close by the riverbank

 it looked something like a modern walking-beam a
man stood at each end who tipped the water out of the
buckets into the trough that carried it overside

  man the benches out oars ill show
you a fight to suit you between here and
lunden town

chapter iii

battle

tt was a desperate dinning fight that
raged to the south of the river and a few
miles south of lunden the tide slackened
and began to change the bireme made slow
progress it was a long time before tros
made out the mast of another longship be-
tween the trees ahead of him but long be-
fore that he could hear and see trees fall-
ing as the britons felled them in the north-
mens path orwic kept up a running com-
ment

  thats a good joke they have burned
borstens village his father was a north-
man theyll have thought to scare cas-
wallon and force terms from him threats
only make him fight did you see that tree
fall thats by borstens brook caswal-
lon has whipped a force together in the nick
of time he has them cut off from the river
there another tree theyre ringing them
around land us yonder tros i know a
short cut to where caswallon stands pray-
ing to the gods for thirty extra men

  no tros answered with a jaw-snap
that conveyed conviction

  tros eyes were on that longship he
lusted to possess it it lay bow out of water
on the mud with a kedge in mid-stream
with which to haul off in a hurry in case of
need in all his wanderings he had never
seen a ship with such sweet lines she was
almost the ship of his dreams-not big
enough but there were only three men
guarding her and she would do for a begin-
ning one of the three men blew a horn-
blast as he sighted the dismasted bireme
tros laugh was like an answering trumpet
call he knew that ship was his if only he
could manage his excited britons

  it was easy enough to read what had hap-
pened a raiding party of northmen caught
ashore by the britons and cut off from their
ship the men left to guard the ship sum-
moned by horn to the rescue only to find
themselves in the same trap

  the britons will burn that ship lud
rot them unless i prevent tros muttered

  but he was hard put to it to keep his own
britons rowing they wanted to ram the
prisoners of war

riverbank and leap ashore to help block the
northmens retreat half of them at a
time and sometimes all of them left the
oars to lean over the bulwark and instruct
tros how to lead in to the bank it was only
when they saw the bireme drifting back-
ward down the river that they returned to
the oars reluctantly

  there began to be downright mutiny
again one man threw a lump of wood
that missed tros by a hairsbreadth the
wounded crawled on deck and cursed him
for a coward alien he thundered on the
drum for silence gesturing to conops at the
helm to hold the bireme in midriver

  you young fools he roared if you
take their ship away what have they left to
retreat to

  but they did not see the point they
wanted to rush to caswallons aid and share
in the glory of cutting down the hereditary
enemy three jumped overboard and swam
for it

  back to your arrow-engine orwic
shoot the next man who leaves his bench
row or lud rot you one two one
two easy starboard port ahead now
all together back her

  he swung the biremes stern toward the
longships kedge-warp and sent conops
overside to bend another warp to it mak-
ing that fast to the biremes stern then-
down-stream now-he bullied them all to
rowing until the kedge came up and the
bireme swayed like a pendulum in mid-
stream mud boiling all around her

  watch those three northmen orwic
shoot if they try to cast off

  the longship heeled her bow began to
swing round on the mud two of the three
who guarded her ran to cut the kedge-warp
with their swords

  shoot

  orwic loosed twelve arrows in one flight
and one man fell the other hid himself be-
low the bulwarks the third sprang to the
longships stern and hacked the warp
through with a battle-ax but too late the
ship slid off the mud at last and glided into
midstream

  the bireme shot ahead when the warp
parted it was a minute before backed oars
could take the way off her then port oars
forward starboard oars astern tros swung
her in a circle in midstream

  two minutes after that they broke three
oars as the bireme bumped the longship

and a dozen britons led by orwic jumpeci
aboard the two norsemen took to the
river like water-rats four britons plunged
after them tros lashed the ships together
beam to beam and let them drift down-
river with the tide which set toward the
south bank away from the fighting

  a quarter of a mile downstream he
dropped two anchors he and conops stand-
ing guard over the cables lest the indignant
britons should cut them and try to row
across to the other side only orwic and he
nervously stood by him the remainder
wounded included threatened threatened
and cursed him for a flinching coward but
as they could not swim they could not
leave him

  tros watched the far bank trying to
imagine what he himself would do if he were
a northman hemmed in by determined ene-
mies and cut off from his ship those
northmen doubtless had a leader wise in
war chosen to lead raids because of pre-
vious successes

  he did not believe they would have
landed without exploring all the riverbank
it was at least an even chance that the two
who had swum for shore had reached their
friends to warn them the ship was gone

  orwic bit his fingernails torn three ways
between loyalty to tros anxiety for his
friends ashore and eagerness to lead his own
men into the thick of the fighting

  by lud we will be too late he grum-
bled too late too late tros-

  if caswallon can keep them away from
the river theres no need for us tros an-
swered if they reach the river theyll
find boats and try to recapture their ship
but there arent any boats orwic
objected

  then again no need for us but i will
wager there are boats among the reeds and
the northmen know it

  then lets hunt for boats and burn them
  troslaughed

  set this crowd of ours ashore and wholl
keep them out of the fighting

  the britons and some of the wounded
with them had nearly all jumped into the
longship and were holding a sort of parlia-
ment even the hired seamen taking part
an iron bolt hurled at tros just missed him
where he stood in the biremes bow and
some one shouted-

  cross the river or well burn both
ships
adventure

        they had found the north-
mens fire-pot and meant busi-
ness there was smoke where half
a dozen of them stooped over
a box full of kindling blowing on it
by plutos teeth yell burn my prize
of war

   tros would rather see a city burned than
lose that sweet-lined ship he leaped on
the longships bow roared like a bull and
charged them scattering them right and
left kicking fire-pot and kindling overboard
before they could draw their weapons and
by that time he had his back against the
mast the hilt of his long sword on a level
with his chin its point just sufficiently in
motion to confirm the resolution in its own-
ers eye	

  they were not afraid of him exactly
there was none at that crisis who would
not have dared to try conclusions they
had all fought romans on the kentish
beach had beaten caesars men at seine-
mouth had been trained since they were
old enough to hold a weapon against the
wolf the northmen and the neighboring
british tribes

  cowardice was their pet abomination
but he had them puzzled they were
celts hereditary gentlemen much given to
reflection and to arguing all sides of every-
thing deeply versed in chivalry and legend
and despising the notion of attacking one
man in overwhelming numbers against
any one except northmen they preferred
argument to violence they admired him
for his daring to defy them all

  four of them kept him backed against
the mast six others engaged conops in the
 longships bow fending off his vicious knife-
thrusts while two more hacked the cables
through and set both ships adrift again

   but they drifted toward the wrong shore
naturally since the tide set that way

  within a hundred yards they were
aground on clinging mud and in a moment
after that there were only wounded left to
reckon with the remainder hired seamen
and all had plunged overside and were
struggling shoulder - deep to reach the
swampy bank and hunt for boats rafts
anything in which to cross the river

   orwic hesitated tros took pity on him
and a shrewd thought for himself

   friend o mine i give you leave to go
he said laughing and orwic jumped over-
side without touching the bulwark

  and so by law if there is any law the
longships mine tros chuckled

  some of the britons began to swim across
the river using logs to help them breast the
third of a mile of strong stream four men
found a raft near the edge of the swamp and
wasted several minutes arguing with seven
wounded men who tried to take it from
them until orwic arrived and seized com-
mand he put the wounded on the raft and
made the others help him swim the crazy
thing

  several men found horses-britons could
be trusted to smell a horse if there were one
within five miles-and within fifteen min-
utes of the ships touching the mud the last
horse took the water with its long mane
held by two men and a third-he had only
one arm--clinging to its tail

   battle raged unseen on the far bank to the
tune of horn-blasts and the crash of falling
trees chariot and horseback fighting-
the britons favorite method-had devel-
oped a type of defensive tactics to corre-
spond they were experts at felling trees in
the path of an advancing or retreating
enemy ringing him around if possible
blocking the narrow forest paths and reen-
forcing the dense tangled undergrowth
with massive tree-trunks

  it was easy to read the wavering for-
tune of the battle by observing trees that
fell in different directions three four at a
time

  once it seemed as if the northmen were
surrounded then as if they were making
good retreat toward where they had left
their longship but that might have been a
feint the shouting and crashing changed
direction there followed a din of horn-
blasts as the britons reformed ranks and
rushed to block a new line of retreat

  once three northmen iron helmeted and
armed with battle-axes showed themselves
on a bare hillock near by the ruins of a
burned hut on the riverbank but they were
cut down instantly by a score of britons who
rushed out of the forest

  once tos thought he saw caswallon
mounted galloping along the rivers edge
to turn the northmens flank

  it was easy now to distinguish norse
from british horn-blasts the northmens
note was flat blown on an ox-horn the
britons used copper and even silver instru-
ments that rang through the woods with an
exciting peal shouting and horn-blasts
prisoners of war

signified that the northmen had fought
clear of the felled-tree barriers were retir-
ing in considerable number almost parallel
with the riverbank their right flank possi-
bly two hundred yards away from it with
an apparently impenetrable thicket in be-
tween them and the river

  by the sound they were circling that
thicket on the far side the britons were
striving to crowd them against it

  except for a few feet of stump-dotted
marsh it reached almost to the waters edge
-an obstacle to briton and northmen alike
but once or twice tros could see britons
creeping into it to take the northmen in
flank or from the rear armed with spears
with which to thrust at the northmens
backs from behind the cover of the under-
growth

  once about two score britons tried to
make their way between the river and the
trees jumping from clump to clump of turf
and rotting roots but the strip of marsh
came to an end in knee-deep mud in which
they floundered until they gave up the at-
tempt and struggled back again to hack a
path through the undergrowth toward the
enemys flank

  ten minutes after that the northmens
strategy revealed itself they fought their
way around the thicket to a creek that tros
could not see because of intervening trees
the news that they had reached it was an-
nounced by a frantic chorus of british bugle-
notes

  another thirty or forty britons charged
along the riverbank and tried to force their
way to the creek-mouth but were prevented
by the mud that grew deeper the farther
they went until some of them floundered to
the breast in it and had to be hauled out by
their friends

  and presently from behind the trees that
shut off tros view of the creek-mouth three
small boats emerged crowded with north-
men towing others who clung to the boats
gunwales helping to shove the boats along
until the water grew too deep

  the northmens shields were a solid pha-
lanx behind which they crouched in the
boats protecting the paddlers against brit-
ish arrows some of the men in the water
swam with shields over the heads but some
were already drowning tros counted
nearly sixty men and there more behind
them too late for the boats or crowded out

dodging missiles as they swam

  

        their leader stood in the
boat a big man with long mu
taches drooping to his chin and
bushy clipped red beard young
hardly thirty by the look of him but a gian
in stature with a head that drooped a little
forward as if he were a habitual deep-
thinker or else wounded or very weary

  he was nearly a full head taller than the
tallest of his men two of whom stood be-
side him their eyes were on the britons
ashore but his were on the longship he
stood recklessly ignoring arrows hardly
troubling to raise the painted shield on his
left arm as the boats drew nearer tros
saw three women crouching among the men

  if that chief loves a ship as i do he will
fight tros said to conops swiftly bid
our wounded show their heads above the
bulwark

  the longship had had the inside berth
when both ships took the mud but the tide
had carried their sterns around pivoting
them on the biremes ram which presently
stuck fast so that now both sterns were out
into the stream with the longship free ex-
cept for the ropes that held her to the
biremes side

  smashed oars jammed between them
kept the ships sides frm grinding and the
water making in the biremes hold brought
her down by the stern so that she lay now
for two-thirds of her length on soft mud im-
movable until they should pump the water
out and the tide should turn again and lift
her

  tros climbed up to the biremes poop
leaving conops on the longships bow and
carefully chose twelve arrows from the
basket laying them in the arrow-engines
grooves and cranking the clumsy mechan-
ism that drew the bow taut then he stud-
ied the wounded some of whom by using
all their strength could hardly keep their
heads above the bulwark there was not one
man among them fit for fighting whoever
could carry his weight had gone with orwic
to the battle in the woods

  men of lunden tros said for he knew
they liked that better than if he had called
them britons we will burn both ships
under us rather than let northmen have
them but i think those northmen have a
bellyfull let your heads appear and reap-
pear as if there were a host of you crouch-
ing below the bulwark

  many of them lacked strength to keep
adventure

  ir chins above the bulwark for more than
  few seconds at a time they raised their
  ads let go and struggled up again to
  ratch the approaching boats which came
  ery slowly for lack of enough paddles and
  ecause of the overload and the strength of
  he tide in midstream

 on the far shore the britons were using
horses to drag felled trees into the water
laboring shoulder-deep to lash a raft to-
gether on which enough of them might cross
to dare to give the northmen battle

 but that was a work that required time
the northmen had burned all the buildings
within reach so there were no doors or
hewn timber available

 the northmen appeared to have no in-
formation about arrow-engines but they
seemed to expect ordinary arrow-fire as
they won their way across-stream in slow
procession more than fifty yards apart and
the distance between them increasing they
kept their boats heads pointed toward the
ships sterns to reduce the breadth of the
target and the men in the bows raised a
sloping barricade of locked shields but they
were wooden shields tros engine could
have shot a flight of arrows through them
as easily as an ordinary arrow goes through
leather jerkins

 the northman chief chose to lighten his
boat he growled an order and six men
leaped into the water leaving only twelve
and three women the six along with
those who had swum alongside all the way
turned back and made for the second boat
which was already overcrowded

 leaning his weight against the table on
which the arrow-engine turned tros let the
leading boat approach within two ships
lengths before he tried conclusions

 who comes here to yield himself he
shouted then in the gaulish tongue for he
knew neither norse nor any of the dialects
of northern britain which a northman
might possibly have understood

 that leading boat was at his mercy it
was a frail thing nearly awash with the
weight of men but he could see those fair-
haired women crouching among the mens
legs and though he would have taken oath
before a pantheon of gods that his own heart
was invulnerable-that whether a foe was
male or female was all one to him-he held
his finger on the trigger yet a while

 the northmen seemed to hesitate they
let their boat turn sidewise head upstream

exposing its whole flank to tros the
chieftain in the midst uphove a great
two-headed ax and gestured at the bi-
remes stern shouting strange words in
a voice that resembled waves echoing in
caverns

  it appeared he was defying tros to single
combat a disturbing possibility that tros
had overlooked he was under no com-
pulsion to accept a challenge but he knew
what the britons-and their women in par-
ticular-would say of any man who should
refuse one it was part of the tactics of war
so to fight as to provide an enemy no op-
portunity to issue such a challenge until the
outcome of single combat could not affect
the issue either way

  however tros was not sure he had under-
stood yet and there were no women in the
third boat which was laboring in mid-
stream losing headway against the tide
they were rowing with a pole and broken
branches he loosed the flight of arrows at
it plunking the whole dozen square amid-
ships

  the wounded britons yelled delight the
arrows pierced the shields and struck men
down who fell against the farther gun-
wale and upset the crowded boat the
others jumping to save themselves cap-
sized it and it drifted down-stream bot-
tom upward

  the second boat backed out of range
avoiding the men in the water because there
was no room for them it was nearly awash
already without the added burden of strong
hands on the gunwale and heavy men seek-
ing to clamber overside its crew of dis-
couraged northmen elected presently to
drift down-stream hoping perhaps to make
connection with the crew of the other long-
ship lower down

  so there was only one boat left to deal
with for the moment one boat eleven men
and that great grim northman captain
with the women crouching at his knees
the northmans eyes were on the long-
ship he was close enough for tros to see
them and to recognize despair the mother
of forlorn hope

  no ruler loves a kingdom as the true sea-
captain loves a ship he built and navigated
through the rock-staked seas tros knew
that blue-eyed yearning he could ever feel
it in his own bones when he planned the
queen of all ships he would some day build
and sail into the unknown
prisoners of war

he laid another dozen arrows
in the grooves and cranked the
engine but the northman who
could see him plainly stayed
within range flourishing his ax as if he
courted death bellowing his bull-mouthed
phrases that to tros conveyed less meaning
than his gestures

  they were a challenge repeated again
and again there was no humility about
that man in his defeat he was as splendid as
in victory demanding a right that no brave
man might keep from him one of the
wounded britons called to tros interpret-
ing his words

  he bids you fight him for the longship
beat him says he and he surrenders to
you-he and his men and his women if he
beats you he takes the longship and you
must help him sail it home but if each
should kill the other then his men- and
women - folk are at caswallons mercy
those are his terms you must fight him
tros

  but it irked tros to be told he must do
anything he could have shot that north-
man down and though the wounded britons
would have mocked him for a coward he
was strong-willed he could face their scorn
if he saw fit

  his eyes were on the farther riverbank
where now a hundred of caswallons men
were working like beavers to build the raft
and he was calculating just how long they
would require to finish it and to pole it
across the river he decided they would
never be able to move such a clumsy plat-
form fast enough through the water to over-
take the northmen although if the bireme
and the longship were attacked they might
arrive in time to save both and if they were
successful they would claim the longship as
their lawful plunder

  it was therefore up to him tros to de-
cide and to do it swiftly

  he doubted caswallon remembered that
gaulish fishing-boat dismasted in the chan-
nel storm recalled to mind the likelihood
that caesars men had undermined him in
caswallons favor by some ingenious means
even if tros should fight for the longship
and defeat the northman caswallon might
claim as his own property all shipping cap-
tured in the thames

  caesars treasure-chest left with caswal-
lon for safe keeping would be a strong temp-
tation to caswallons intimates if not to the

chief himself to force a quarrel and the long
ship if tros should claim it for his own
might prove an excellent excuse it was a
sharp predicament

  but the northman kept on challenging
and the wounded britons urged and sud-
denly a blue-eyed girl stood up beside the
northman with fair hair falling in long
plaits nearly to her knees

  she set one foot on the gunwale and
mocked tros in the gaulish language
calling him a coward among other names
the words were ill-pronounced but her
voice throbbed with such scorn as tros had
never listened to-he who had heard harbor-
women scold their lovers on the wharfs of
antioch and alexandria

  the words-he knew their worth and
could ignore them-might have left him
careless but the voice and her manner
brought the hot blood to his cheeks he
had never seen a woman like her had never
before felt such strange emotions as her
anger stirred in him she looked not older
than nineteen

  tros threw his hand up in a gesture of
command briton and northman alike
paused breathless at the signal

  tell me your name he demanded

  he had right to know that a man did not
engage in single combat with inferiors by
birth

  i am olaf sigurdsen of malmoe

  i am tros the son of perseus prince of
samothrace tros answered laughing to
himself

  his father would have been finely scanda-
lized at the proceedings

  i will fight you on your own terms
come aboard

  they paddled the boat toward the bireme
but tros bade them halt when they were
half a dozen boats length distant he had
heard that northmen were colossal liars
although he had only heard that from their
enemies the britons he knew they were
plunderers by profession he doubted it was
in them to keep faith if they should learn
that only wounded men were on the bireme
and that the longship lay defenseless he
summoned conops posted him at the loaded
arrow-engine

  come aboard alone he said then
speaking slowly waiting for the blue-eyed
girl to interpret to olaf sigurdsen

  he laid his right hand on the arrow-
engine
adventure

 you may put in to the riverbank i
  count it treachery if more than one
 an steps ashore then climb on to this
 ireme over the bow and let the boat put
 ut again into the river you must fight
 me on my own poop olaf sigurd sen

  i will come and yet i have no proof of
you the northman answered

  the blue-eyed girl translated that with
such withering scorn that tros winced
olaf sigurdsen sat down perhaps to rest
himself but the girl stood continuing to
glare at tros until the boats bow touched
the mud and she had to clutch the chieftains
head to keep her balance

  conops turned the arrow-engine follow-
ing the boat and went through ostenta-
tious pantomime of taking aim but olaf
sigurdsen jumped ashore and they poled the
boat out again into the stream driving the
pole into the mud presently to serve as an
anchor against the tide

 then sigurdsen came up over the bow
and battle-ax on hip stood realizing how
he had deceived himself tros wounded
britons sprawled along the deck below the
bulwark most of them with hardly strength
enough to grin at him some almost in the
grip of death -all bleeding through blood-
stiffened bandages he saw the shapes of-
dead men under the sail-cloth forward of the
citadel and gave a great laugh lifting his
battle-ax high and shouting to his friends
hah they have had a taste of us
they must have met with volstrums ship
down-river volstrum bit them to the
marrow all but two

 the norsemen cheered and all three
women in the boat mocked tros the young
girl thumping her breast and claiming him
as her own slave to fetch and carry for her
and to feed swine

  dont slay him beat him to his knees
she cried to sigurdsen and repeated it in
gaulish so that tros might understand

 you may come said tros and drew
well back along the poop drawing his long
sword throwing off the roman cloak and
stepping close to the arrow-engine so that
conops might unbuckle the breast-armor

 the wounded britons cheered him when
the armor fell on deck for they despised a
man who did not bare his naked breast to
an assailant then pulling off his shirt
tros flexed his huge muscles so that the
hairy skin moved in waves and the bri-
tons cheered again he keeping his eyes on

sigurdsen and speaking through the corner
of his mouth to conops

  now no dogs work keep your knife to
yourself if you so much as lift a hand to
help me ill turn from the fighting to skewer
you to the deck you understand hands
off

sigurdsen came slowly up the
ladder to the poop ready to jump
backward if tross hould spring at
him before his feet were on the
deck but tros gave him full law and a
breathing spell considering the iron links
on the outside of the northmens leather
jerkin wondering whether the iron was soft
or brittle

  the northman wore no helmet he had
lost it in the fighting over-river his red-
dish hair hung to his shoulders and his
blood-shot eyes shone with a gleam of des-
peration under an untidy fringe and he had
brought no shield he looked tired but
he was not wounded the blood on his face
was from a scratch caused by brambles as
he fought his way out of the forest

  for a full minute he and tros stood study-
ing each other conops whispering advice
that tros ignored

  the point master the point up
and under the chin remember an ax is all
blade he can only swing with it but he
has a long reach keep close where he can
only use short chops and use your point

  at last the northman growled like an
angry bear and came on his weight on the
balls of his feet which made him tower
above tros holding his great ax forward in
both hands

  tros met him with the point stock-mo-
tionless not giving ground until the north-
man stepped back suddenly and with the
speed of lightning swung at the sword to
break it tros wrist hardly moved but
the ax-blade missed the sword-blade by an
inch and the point went in between two
links of the northmans mail

  the prick of that maddened him he came
on like a whirlwind swinging the ax up-
ward at tros jaw-missed because tros
stepped back at last and rising on both
feet aimed two-handed at the crown of
tros head

  tros sprang aside expecting the ax would
crash into the deck and leave the northman
at his mercy but the blow was turned in
middescent and swept at him as if his body
prisoners of war

were a tree-trunk slicing the skin at his
waist-then the same blow back again
back-handed quicker than a snakes strike
and tros had to jump clear

  the northman rushed him crouched a
little with his knees bent thrusting up-
ward at the sword-blade so that tros lunge
only skinned his crown beginning at the
forehead but that brought blood down into
the northmans eyes half-blinding him and
he missed his next swing wildly

  he tried to shake the blood off spared his
left hand for a second but that cost him a
thrust through the arm and conops yelled
retorts in greek to the women who screamed
encouragement in norse

  tros had his man now knew it carried
the fight to him side-stepping the prodi-
gious swings and thrusting forever thrust-
ing with short jabs at the northmans right
arm circling cautiously around him with
his knees bent and his legs spread well apart

  the air screamed with the ax-blows
twice the northman knocked the sword-
blade upward rushed in under it and tried
to brain tros with the up-thrust using the
ax-end like a club and tros had never
fought an ax-man he caught the first of
those blows underneath his arm-pit and for
a moment it deadened his whole left side

  but every time the northman pressed a
savage charge home it cost him blood from
some part of his body ten times tros
could have killed him and refrained he
kept on thrusting at the right arm until the
blood streamed down and the ax-hilt slipped
in the northmans fingers

  then for two or three titanic minutes
sigurdsen swung with his left alone using
his right to try to grab tros sword-blade
but tros opened the cut in his forehead
again and the northman jumped back to
the poop-rail trying to shake blood out of
his eyes

  now kill him master conops shouted
up under the chin and finish him

  but tros stood back breathing heavily
point forward and his sword-hand high

  now yield he said to sigurdsen ignor-
ing the yells of the northmen in the boat
that might have put him on his guard if he
had paid attention to them

  he spared one swift glance for the britons
over-river they were coming at last a hun-
dred of them crowded on a crazy raft with
horses swimming loose on either side of it
and two men clinging to each horses tail

  but that one glance was nearly one t
many in the fraction of a second th
he spared for it the northman stiffene
whirled his ax and hurled it with both hands
straight at tros head it cut his right
cheek as he side-stepped to avoid it crashec
against the citadel and stuck in the wood-
work humming

  and now olaf sigurdsen yield yourself
for you and your women and those other
men are mine said tros

  sigurdsen bowed his head and held up his
right hand conops shouted at the top
of his lungs in greek and the wounded
britons cheered raising themselves by the
bulwark to taunt the northmen in the boat
sigurdsen offered his throat for tros sword
but tros wiped his blade on conops shirt
and rammed it home into the sheath

  and the longship too is mine he said

  sigurdsen nodded he and tros could
understand each other when the conversa-
tion was of such essentials as ships

  tros held out his right hand

  can you see it sigurdsen he asked

  the northman shook the blood out of his
eyes again stared dumbly for a moment
came two or three steps forward as if doubt-
ing what he saw and stood rigid waiting
he was dazed it seemed he still expected
to be killed

  tros seized him in both arms patting him
on the back and conops cried being a
greek who had few emotions of his own but
huge capacity for feeling what he supposed
tros felt the northman sobbed as if his
lungs would burst but whether that was
grief or anger noqe might say and there
came a keening from the boat alongside led
by womens voices

  they had had to keep faith whether or
not they had intended it because the raft
was nearly in midstream and there was no
longer the slightest hope of escape from the
hurrying britons

  tros kicked the arrow-basket and up-
ended it let sigurdsen to sit there and
ordered conops to bring water and cleanse
his wounds then he pulled on his shirt
and leaned overside to speak to the girl who
had mocked him

  she was silent dry-eyed standing in the
boat-it was the other older women and
the men who wailed her eyes met tros
defiantly bewildering blue eyes like flakes of
northern sky under her flaxen hair eyes that
made tros feel unfamiliar emotions they
adventure

 med able to rob him of the fruit of
 ctory

 you may come up and tell me your
 ame he said gruffly

 i am helma sister of olaf sigurdsen
yhe answered but she made no motion to
bey him simply stood there with her
hands clasped

tros vaulted the rail descended
midway down the wooden ladder
that was spited to the biremes
side and offered her his right
hand she refused it with an imperious
chin-gesture that commanded him to climb
and let her follow so he laughed and led

  she was beside him almost before his own
feet touched the deck there their eyes met
again and he smiled but she turned her
back went to her brothers side to take
the sponge from conops and attend his
wounds she said not one word to tros or
to her brother or to any one

chapter iv

tros makes prisoners and falls in need
of friends

the raft drew near and as the horses
 feet found bottom they were har-
nessed to it to increase the speed cas-
wallon with orwic beside him stood in the
rafts bow wiping blood off the white skin
over his ribs where a northmans spear had
entered an inch or two he wore belted
breeches spear and shield and a little
peaked iron cap but the blue designs
painted on his skin made it look as if he
wore a shirt too until he was a dozen yards
away

 there was no news tros could give him
orwic had told about volstrums ship sunk
lower down the thames the northmen
whom tros could claim as his own prison-
ers men and women had climbed aboard
the bireme and were standing in the ships
waist looking miserable all except sigurd-
sens wife who was helping helma tend his
wounds

 the other woman was a widow her man
had been cut down by the britons in the
forest fighting and she was keening to the
sky about her loss

 as many of the wounded britons on the
bireme as could stand up shouted to cas-
wallon and his men the news of sigurdsens

surrender including the terms of combat
and the fact that the longship now belonged
to tros

  by the look on orwics face there was
something in the wind beside the northman
business he kept glancing at caswallon and
from him to tros who for his own part
studied the prisoners and counted their
weapons on the poop beside him conops
swearing greek oaths leaned against the
arrow-engine itching to loose its charge
against the britons on the raft if they should
dare to invade the longship he knew how
much loot they would leave in it they
would burn it when every movable stick
had been ripped away

  however caswallon came hand-over-
hand up the biremes ladder followed by
orwic and six others he ordered the men on
the raft ashore to find some way of follow-
ing the norse fugitives down-stream half
a dozen tried to disobey him swarming up
the biremes side but he jumped off the
poop and beat them back with his spear-
butt the others laughing at them from the
raft

  then caswallon looked the wounded over
-a third of them were his blood-relations-
and said a few words to each before he
climbed the poop again and answered tros
salute

  so you have come home tros

  he smiled but he did not offer to embrace
tros as the british custom was orwic
tells me you are a great sea-captain

  his words were almost cordial there
only lacked a half-note and the old careless
air of friendship to make him the same
caswallon who had seen the bireme on its
way from lunden ten days before-but that
might be due to the fighting over-river and
distress to see so many good men dead and
maimed tros answered with his hands be-
hind him

  i bring my fathers body for which i
must beg obsequies i crave the favor that
he may lie in british earth beside your own
brave men caswallon not a man is miss-
ing dead or alive i have brought them all

  caswallon nodded glancing to right and
left

  are you well enough paid-with a long-
ship and-how many prisoners he asked

  i never asked payment tros answered
caswallon what is wrong between us

  caswallon frowned stroking his mus-
tache and tossing the long hair back over
prisoners of war

his shoulder for a moment he studied the
blue-eyed girl who was washing her broth-
ers wounds but she turned her back toward
him and he met tros eyes again

  if what i hear of you is true i will
nevertheless remember former friendship
tros if it is not true it is better not
spoken in mens hearing let us talk
alone

  tros led the way down from the poop
and into the cabin where his fathers body
lay the smell in there was stifling cas-
wallon snorted but tros threw the door
wide and they stood together studying the
old mans face

  like a druid caswallon said at the
end of a long silence

  greater than any druid tros answered
gruffly

  wftiat are those marks on his wrists
caswallon asked

  caesar tortured him

  they faced each other in the light that
poured through the open door

  is it true or is it not true tros that
you have made a pact with caesar

  it is not true tros said frowning
who has come telling you that lie

  skell you spared skells life when you
had the right to kill him you sent him to
caesar as you told me to help you to trick
caesar but now skell returns with a tale
about secret intriguing

  tros whistled

  i turned skell over to caesars men at
caritia thinking they would put him in the
pest-house has skell won caesars confi-
dence so soon

  he is home again and in strange com-
pany said caswallon i have not seen
him but-

  tros laid a hand on caswallons arm

   i speak he said in the presence of the
dead believe me or skell which shall
it be

  caswallon turned his back and stood for
a full minute in the doorway stroking his
chin watching the wounded on the deck
druids had arrived from somewhere with
their long skirts tucked into their girdles
they were pouring liquid on to stiffened
bandages examining wounds behaving
workmanly as if they knew their trade
caswallon turned suddenly

  tros he exclaimed i am beholden
to you twice and i would not take skells
word for it that the sun is not the moon

yet orwic tells me you refused to fight the
northmen until you ran into them down-
river and there was no room for you to run
he tells me that at seine-mouth you spoke
with caesar in latin which is a tongue we
britons dont understand

  i called on caesar to surrender to me
tros interrupted he had climbed over

the bow when i sunk his boat and-

  and orwic tried to capture him but you
called orwic off caesar did not surrender
but you and he spoke after which he es-
caped and now comes skell to hythe
whence he sends me a letter by a womans
hand and the woman says caesar has
promised you my kingdom when i am dead
in return for your having spared his life
she had a letter for you from caesar writ-
ten in latin which i can not read these
northmen raided hythe before they came
up-thames how is it you were so long
following them up-river

  storms i was hove-to in the ocean
moreover i did not know of northmen in
the thames when i saw the smoke of

villages-

  my men say you refused to let them land
and run to my aid

  did i not sink a longship tros
asked indignantly

  yes when there was no alternative
and now when you might hive shot these
other northmen down you let one whole
boat-load of them escape and you accept
their chiefs surrender to yourself-their
chief three women and how many men
i find that strange

  will you listen to me tros asked and
when caswallon nodded he told his own
story from the beginning omitting no de-
tails not even his own qualms and his
thoughts of making for the belgian coast

  for i foresaw you might doubt me and
i knew caesar would be swift with some
ingenious trick now it amounts to this
caswallon i am caesars enemy and your
friend but you and i are free men you
may end our friendship when it pleases
you

  caswallon hesitated with his hands be-
hind him there was something on his
mind still

  i have told all what are you keeping
from me tros asked him

  you shall speak with fflur caswallon
answered

  tros breathed relief whoever else was
adventure

ckle he knew fflur caswallons wife
as loyal to caswallon but no subtlety
ould undermine her judgment she could
see through men and their intrigues she
ruled her husband and his corner of britain
without his knowing it and she was tros
friend

  in the meanwhile tros asked

  i do not forget you were my friend
caswallon answered and though you have
lost me sixty men on your adventure you
have saved me it may be a hundred in their
place by sinking that northman down-river
i am kmg here and the river rights are mine
but you may have that longship and your
prisoners that chest of caesars gold you
left with fflur is yours too you may bury
your fathers corpse in british earth
thereafter we will hear what fflur says

       caswallon strode out on the
deck and went to where the druids
jfloffp were tending wounds because he
was the chief a druid tried to in-
sist on bandaging the spear-wound over his
ribs but caswallon took the druid by the
shoulders and shoved him back to the task
he had left standing then to watch the mar-
vels of swift surgery the druids wrought

  they had a drug that caused unconscious-
ness they opened one mans skull and inset
bone from the skull of another who had been
dead an hour or two one druid opened his
own vein and surrendered a quart of blood
for the veins of a man who had nearly bled
to death but they amputated no limbs
if a leg or an arm was beyond their skill to
repair they let the man die whole as he had
come into the world easing his death with
an anodyne

  tros returned to the poop where sigurd-
sen sat glowering at the britons his wife
wailing on the deck beside him and the
blue-eyed helma standing her back to the
rail and her chin high too proud to shed
tears too hopeless to speak even to her
own kin

  she looked away over tros shoulder at
the skyline and tros who had seen well-
bred women sold at auction in many a
foreign port turned over in his mind what
he might say that should console her-
possibly a little if not much

  can your people ransom you he asked

  she met his eyes and answered with

   many of the skulls discovered in ancient british bury-
ing-places and on battle fields bear marks of having been
trephined

surprizing calm her voice not trembling
no these are all my people there
was war and the men of helsing burned our
villages there was neither corn nor dried
meat left and the fishing is hard in winter
so we came to seize a holding here my
brother and volstrum of fiborg-by-mal-
moe with their two ships and all the men
that remained most of the women and
children had been carried off by the men of
helsing none can ransom us unless vol-
strum comes up-river and if he comes-

  he will not come tros assured her
i have sunk his ship if he is not drowned
he will fall into the britons hands

  she betrayed no emotion at that news
but repeated it in norse to her brother who
laid his head between his hands and
groaned aloud

  will you sell her to me asked a briton
one of the men who had been in the thick of
the fighting across the river and had boarded
the bireme with caswallon i bid you
two man-slaves and two horses for her
no tros answered and the other
britons sneered at the man who made the
bid

  they all had slaves buying and selling
was lawful they now and then sold criminals
and captives to foreign ship-owners to re-
place sailors who had died of scurvy but
they did not approve of barter in human
beings

  however there was an atmosphere of
enmity to tros some one had been spread-
ing rumors they held aloof from him
giving him two-thirds of the biremes poop
instead of crowding to ask questions or to
boast of their own prowess against the
northmen in the woods

  what shall i do with you tros asked
meeting the girls sky-blue eyes

  he knew what he would do with sigurd-
sen unless destiny should interfere so
sigurdsens wife was no problem and the
widow-woman who was wailing in a corner
below the poop would dry her eyes before
long and be chosen as some mans mate
but this fair-haired girl puzzled him

  i said what i would do if sigurdsen had
beaten you she answered i would have
put iron on your neck and you should have
fetched and carried for me

  but i beat sigurdsen said tros i
am obliged to make provision for you
shall i marry you to one of his men

  she bared her teeth
prisoners of war

  anything but that she answered scorn-
fully they all ran from the men of hel-
sing they ran and their women and
children became captives yonder in those
woods they ran again instead of dying
where they stood

  suddenly her eyes laughed as if she saw
the ultimate of irony and took delight in it

  i belong to you she went on are
you also a coward

  tros stroked his black beard squaring
back his shoulders not so soon if ever
would he link fate with a woman his
father had instilled into him at least that
one conviction yielding to that lure and
freedom of earth and sea were incompatible

  i have yet to meet the woman who can
conquer me he answered

  she glared as if she would like to stab
him but he saw something else in her eyes
that he could not read and he was aware of
a prodigious impulse to befriend her

  if she only had used the usual feminine
ways of ensnaring a man he would have
felt more at ease but she did none of that
she turned away from him and knelt beside
her brother speaking to him earnestly in
norse which tros could not understand

  sigurdsen stood up presently and looked
straight at tros he was already in a fever
from his wounds and his eyes burned des-
perately although his face was sad and was
made to look sadder by the long mustache
that drooped below his chin he spoke
about a dozen words helma interpreting
kneeling speaking very loud because her
back was toward tros

  put us all into the longship therein
burn us we will not seek to escape

  tros laughed at that

  not i he answered i need the long-
ship and i need a crew you and i might
burn a fleet or two sigurdsen britons
say northmen are bold liars greeks have
the name of being crafty ones and greek is
my mother tongue so how can you and i
pledge faith

  helma interpreted glancing once at
tros over her shoulder

  i am olaf sigurdsen the northman
answered and closed his ups but helma
added to that standing at last and holding
her chin high

  if you were good norse stock instead of
a barbarian with amber eyes you would
know what that means

  tell him he must keep faith better than

he fights if he hopes to please me tros
answered for he liked the look of olaf
sigurdsen he wanted to prod him and find
what lay beneath the sorry mask

  the girl flared until her cheeks were
crimson under the flaxen hair her breast
heaved with passion her hands grew white
with pressure as she clenched her fingers
but she contrived to force a frozen note into
her voice speaking straight at tros as if
each word were a knife aimed at his throat

  he was a spent man when he fought you
or you would be his slave this minute
he has slain his two-score britons in the
forest you-you do not know courage
you do not know faith how shall i tell
you the worth of his promise you who
never kept faith olaf sigurdsens fathers
were kings when ice first closed in on the
north and darkness fell at midday i am a
kings daughter shall he and i waste
words on you

  tros liked her he forbore to answer her
in kind and he had seen too often the re-
sults of promises exacted under force yet
he needed friends he needed them that
minute

  is he homeless and has been a king
i too am homeless and the son of a prince
it seems to me we have a common ground to
meet on he said speaking very slowly that
she might lose none of the significance
when a man plights faith to me i hold
him to it but i repay him in kind

  say to sigurdsen i give him choice
he may fight me again when he has rested
tomorrow or the next day or a month from
now and in that case i will kill him or
he may ask my friendship and make promise
to obey me as his captain and in that case
he shall find in honorable service no indig-
nity or if he wishes i will give you all
to caswallon who is a king whereas i am
not one let sigurdsen speak his mind

the girls reaction to that speech
was vivid she changed color bit
her lip grew pale and red again
regarding tros from another as-
pect altogether she seemed to have grown
nervous

  a princes son she said and turned to
her brother speaking to him hurriedly in
breathless sentences clutching his sleeve
repeating short phrases again and again

  her brother watched tros eyes making
no sign until she had finished then
adventure

after a minutes pause he said hardly a
dozen words

  olaf sigurdsen desires your friendship
he will obey you but none other the girl
interpreted then added he means by
that-

  i know what he means by that tros
interrupted and turned to conops who
was listening with unconcealed but mixed
emotions he pointed toward the north-
mans ax its blade buried deep in the wood-
work of the citadel

  bring it and return it to him

  conops never disobeyed but he obeyed
that order like a dog sent to the kennel
taking his time about wrenching the ax free
and longer still about returning with it
tros snatched it from his hand impatiently
and offered it hilt-first to sigurdsen

  now let me hear your promise as a free
man with a weapon in your hand he said
deliberately speak it without guile as in
the presence of your fathers gods for by
the gods of earth and heaven i need
friends he added to himself

  but conops swore greek oaths below
his breath and glared at sigurdsen as
a dog glares at a new prospective ken-
nel-mate

chapter v

a man named skell returns from gaul

caswallon returned to the forest
battlefield to count norse prisoners and
to look after wounded britons without
speaking again to tros even orwic only
waved a noncommittal farewell and tros
was left alone with two ships fifteen pris-
oners and only conops to help him manage
them the twenty hired seamen had re-
turned from over river but they were cer-
tain to be enemies not friends

  the seamen demandedweapons intimat-
ing that the prisoners might make a break
for fiberty but their own only reason for
staying was that tros had not paid them
and he more than suspected they would try
to pay themselves if provided with more
than their own short seamens knives

  even unarmed they were deadly unreli-
able caswallons men who had gone down
the riverbank in pursuit of the one boat-
load of northmen that escaped tros arrow-
fire would be sure to pass news along so it
would be only a matter of time before scores

of longshore pirates would come hurrying in
hope of loot

  tros hirelings would help them strip

away everything portable after which they
would probably burn both ships in a wanton
passion of destruction

  meanwhile tide was flowing both ships
lay fast on the mud no hope of moving
either of them until long after dark the
druids carried wounded and dead ashore
chariots arrived as by a miracle from no-
where and galloped away with their burden
around a clump of trees and over the sky-
line

  there was no road in that direction
therefore no prospect of assistance the
tracks the wheels cut in the turf were new
nearly at right angles to the riverbank and
not even approximately parallel to the direc-
tion from which the chariots had arrived

  to reach lunden would take several
hours of drifting and the distance very
likely was too great for one tide which
would have to rise to three-quarters of its
flow before it could lift the ships and even
so the bireme would have to be pumped out

  so tros took a course few men would have
dared to take he returned their weapons to
his prisoners and brought them all up on
the biremes poop where they could have
overwhelmed him easily he could not
understand their speech nor they his there
was only helma to act interpreter and her
smile proved that she understood tros
predicament her words confirmed it-
i have pledged no friendship

  have i asked it tros demanded
staring at her

  he felt inclined to box her ears hardly
knew why he refrained

  her eyes challenged his but tros seized
the upper hand of her abruptly

  make me a bandage for this cut on my
cheek

  there is zorns wife

  i commanded you

  he pointed to a box of loosely woven linen
stuff that the druids had left on the deck
very well

  she smiled in a way that implied a threat
which tros perfectly understood he had
heard that the norse women were adept
with poison

  tell a seaman to carry it here she
added and for the space of ten more seconds
she defied him

  you fetch it
prisoners of war



  tros amber eyes met hers more stead-
ily than any mans had done and there
was that behind them that fflur cas-
wallons wife had called the ancient wis-
dom although tros was only conscious
of it as determination he knew he must
master this woman or lose control of all
his prisoners far more than sigurdsen
her brother she was the pivot of opinion
although her brother doubtless thought
he ruled the clan

  suddenly she made him a mock curtsey
and went down on deck to bring the ban-
dages carrying the box back on her head
as if she were a bond-woman avoiding the
eyes of her own folk artfully obliging them
to see that tros was making her a menial

  but tros sat down on the up-turned
arrow-basket and submitted his face to be
bandaged as if he had noticed nothing pull-
ing off the heavy gold band that encircled
his forehead and tossing it from hand to
hand while she opened his wound with her
fingers and sponged it she understood
him

  that gold band though it might hang
too loosely on her neck if he should place it
there would be a mark of servitude forever
there were letters and symbols graven on
it and although she could not read them she
had no doubt they were his name and title

  she could not make a bandage stay in
place without wrapping folds of linen under
his jaw and around his forehead so he
could not replace the band when she had
finished he gave it to her to hold for him
and three of the northmen made comments
that brought blushes to her cheek she
answered savagely tongue-lashing them to
silence tros turned his back to her and
roared to the hired seamen to man the
water-hoist

  mutiny - instant and unequivocal
maybe the bandage and the absence of
the gold band made him look less like
a king the coolness toward him of
caswallons men had had effect too
and none knew better than those hire-
lings that longshore pirates would arrive
ere long

  why labor at the hoist when they would
need their strength for looting presently
and for carrying away the loot to villages
up-river the tousle-headed ragged skin-
clad gang defied him noisily and conops
hurled a wooden belaying pin at the head of
the nearest

but the pin was hardly more
abrupt than tros he left the
poop cloak flying in the wind
like a great birds wooping down

on them seizing the heads of two and beat-
ing them against a third discarding those-
they lay unconscious on the deck-hurling
a fourth man broadside into half a dozen
of his friends and pouncing on the ring-
leader who had been captain of a vessel of
his own until tros hired him tros
twisted an arm behind his back until he
yelled then rubbed his nose along the beam
of the waterhoist leaving a smear of blood
the length of it

  man that beam or eat it he com-
manded i will chop and stuff it down
your throats if theres a drop of water in the
bilge at sunset or one backword from one of
you meanwhile

   so they went to work and tros rolled the
three unconscious men toward the trough
until the outpour drenched their heads and
they recovered when he cuffed and shoved
them toward the beam and they began to
labor at it too dazed to know what they
were doing then returning to the poop
he grinned at sigurdsen not glancing at
helma but signing to her to come near and
interpret

  did you build your longship sigurd-
sen

  the northman nodded he was sunk
deep in a northern gloom and too dispirited
to use his voice

  who did the labor these

   sigurdsen nodded again but a trace of
pride betrayed itself as he glanced at his
fellow-prisoners

   i-i taught them all he grunted

  good then bid them calk this bireme
from the inside as the water leaves the hold
use linen clothing frayed rope anything
so be she floats to lunden where well
beach her on the mud

   your ship is no good sigurdsen said
gloomily

  hah but her beak sunk volstrum
tros retorted she has some virtues
we will pick her as the crows pick a horses
ribs and you and i will build a ship together
that shall out-sail all of them

  sigurdsen stared-hardly believed his
ears-grinned at last coming out of his
gloom to order his men to work with the
three women to help them unravel rope to
stuff into the leaking seams but tros


adventure

bade helma stay there on the poop and
when conops had found rope and cloth
enough and the hammering began below
deck he stood in front of her folding his
arms on his breast

  she supposed he intended to use her
again as interpreter between himself and
sigurdsen and made ready to accept that
duty willingly enough it made her feel in-
dispensable and the earlier look of ironic
challenge returned into her eyes but
tros surprized her

  can you cook he demanded

  she nodded stung indignant

  then do it these britons have rotted
my belly with cindered deer-meat until poi-
son would taste like golden oranges from
joppa go the cook-house is in the
citadel i hunger cook enough for six-
teen people

  her eyelids trembled brimming with
indignant tears but she bit her lip and not
a tear fell she held out tros gold fore-
head-band

  keep it he said for your wages

  that chance thrust brought tears at last
she choked a sob tros knew then he had
conquered her although her friendship
might be yet to win and deadlier than her
anger

  i dont work for wages she blurted

  there was more passion in her voice than
when she had screamed to sigurdsen while
the fight waged on the poop she could
endure to be a prisoner to fetch and carry
for her brothers conqueror but as one
whose fathers were kings when ice first
closed in on the north and it was dark at
noonday death looked better than earned
money

  keep it as my gift then tros retorted
with an air of huge indifference

  no

  she thrust the thing toward him and
since he would not take it flung it at his
feet then sobbing hurried down the ladder
and disappeared into the citadel whence
smoke presently emerged

  tros did not want to talk to sigurdsen he
wanted to think it suited him best to
have no interpreter at hand sigurdsen
whose wounds were painful soused his
bandages with water and lay down in a cor-
ner of the poop his eyes alight with fever

  tros leaned against the rail facing the
river bank whence longshore plunderers
might come yet thinking less of them than

of the blue-eyed fair-haired helma she
annoyed him he was vaguely restless at
the thought of having to provide for her
some spark of tyranny within him not yet
gritted out against the rocks of destiny
stirred him toward cruelty and it was
blended with an instinct to defend himself
against all womens wiles

  the custom of the whole known world as
regarded prisoners was even more rigid
and compulsory than written law he
tros was answerable for the fate of fifteen
people they were his property to do with as
he pleased dependent on him obliged to be
obedient on penalty of death their only re-
maining right that of looking to him for
protection-

  he might set them free but if he did so
caswallon should he see fit could punish
him for succoring and aiding public enemies
if he should keep them in lunden it would
probably be months before the britons
would begin to treat them civilly they
would be in danger of mob-violence

  yet if he should imprison them their use-
fulness would vanish they would cease to
feel beholden to himself and would either
seek to escape or else intrigue against him
with any personal enemy who might evolve
out of the political tangle

  britain was full of rival factions hun-
dreds of northmen had found shelter
and prosperity in britain by lending them-
selves to one faction or another and
these new prisoners might find friends
easily enough

  the probability was that caswallon had
met with political trouble during tros ab-
sence some aspirant for power very likely
had accused him of assisting tros with pro-
visions and men at a time when the tribe
could ill afford it

  if caswallons power were in jeopardy
the chief would be a fool not to consider
his own interests and might even feel com-
pelled to show him enmity skell who was
of norse extraction and a natural born
treason-monger might easily enough have
stirred such disaffection as would shake
caswallons chieftainship

  the long and the short of all that was
tros needed friends and the only available
possible friends in sight were his northmen
prisoners whose gratitude he proposed to
earn and keep not that he placed much
faith in gratitude-at any rate not too
much
prisoners of war



  homeless men beaten in battle and re-
duced to the status of serfs can hardly be
blamed for disloyalty if offered opportunity
to regain independence

  tros began to wonder just to what ex-
tent he himself was morally beholden to
caswallon he even meditated taking the
longship which having the lighter draught
would be first off the mud and sailing down-
thames with his northmen to seek safety
on the belgian coast his only reason for
dismissing the idea was his obligation to
bury his father with proper obsequies

  he was particularly thoughtful about the
young girl helma instinct told him to
beware of her to give her no chance to en-
snare him to treat her with less than
courtesy intuition-which is as different
from instinct as black from white-warned
him that she was a friend worth winning
but that nothing could be won by a display
of weakness

  tros was no horseman but he had picked
up british terms from orwic

  shes a finely bred mare that must be
broke before shell handle he reflected
grinning slyly at the smoke emerging
through the cook-house window grinning
again as he thought of his lack of experience
with women

  he wondered to whom he should marry
her the only ultimate solution that occurred
to him

and while he thought of that a
boat came up the river paddled
furiously by eight men keeping
to the far bank to avoid the flow-
ing tide but crossing on a long slant pres-
ently and making straight for the two ships
a man sat in the stern whose features
seemed vaguely familiar-a man in a fever
of haste who shifted restlessly and scolded
at the straining crew

  skell tros muttered impudence-
infinity-the two are one

  he started for the arrow-engine but
thought better of it he could deal with
skell single-handed and there was conops
to help the boats crew were longshore bri-
tons of the type that might murder un-
armed men but would scamper away at the
first threat of serious fighting men of the
sort that had been serfs for generations

  skell came hand over hand uninvited up
the ladder on the biremes stern and stood
still on the poop with his back to the rail

surveying the scene his foxy eyes avoiding
tros and his restless hands keeping osten-
tatiously clear of the sword and dagger he
wore

  his fox-red beard was newly trimmed and
he wore good gaulish clothes under a
smock of dressed brown-stained deer-hide
that came to his knees he would have
looked too well dressed if it had not been
for the stains of travel

  tros he said meeting his eyes suddenly
you and i should cease enmity i did you
a little harm and you had revenge caesar
can employ us both and i have word for
you from caesar

  speak it tros answered

  he despised skell but he was not fool
enough to shut his ears to news

  skell might be caesars man in theory
but a child could tell by his expression that
it was skells advantage he was seeking first
and last he paused picking words and
tros had time to wonder how far such a
reader of mens minds as caesar actually
trusted him

  i heard of these northmen they at-
tacked hythe skell said presently and i
came overland to the thames in hope of
getting word with them for i heard they
were making for lunden i would have
persuaded them to cross to gaul with me
and talk with caesar caesar could have
used such allies as these

  tros nodded caesar would ally himself
with any one to turn an adversarys flank
and would reduce the ally to subjection
afterward but had caesar had time to
say so much to skell tros thought not
it was likelier that skell was speculating
on his own account

  i met britons down-river who told me
you had sunk volstrums ship and captured
this one skell went on glancing repeatedly
at the northman who lay ten feet away
from him clutching with fevered fingers at
the haft of his great ax and i happen to
know tros that caswallon has been turned
against you by a new intrigue believe
me i know that surely

  aye tros answered none should
know better than the man who managed the
intrigue

  skell laughed it began like a fox-bark
but ended in a cackle like an old hens
there was no more mirth in it than comes of
greed and insincerity but there was a
note that had nothing to do with mirth


adventure

which set tros studying the fear in skells
eyes

  that is true tros skell went on i
sent a message to caswallon i brought a
woman from gaul with me one of caesars
light o loves she will make all britain
too hot to hold you but caesar thinks
and i think you are a man of sense caesar
bade me win you over to his side if i can
the britons have turned against you
tros

  tros grinned he grinned like an oger
mirth oozed from him

  hah go and tell your new master
skell that i have his bireme and his gold
i gave him a cold swim at seine-mouth
sunk his boats drowned his men and
wrecked his fleet say that is all prelimi-
nary tell him im minded to make
friends with him at about the time of the
greek calends caesar will know what
that means he talks greek very well
would you care to trust me skell
asked

  no said tros

  because skell continued as if he had
not noticed the refusal for my part i
would rather trust you than caesar or the
britons i have lived my life in britain
but my father was norse and i feel among
these britons like a fish on land as for
caesar--

  he is another alien like me said tros
he and you were not bred under the same
stars nor was i

  caesar is playing caesars hand skell
answered he would use you and me and
then forget us

  he shall never forget me tros re-
marked with conviction grinning again
hugely

  i see you like caesar no more than i
do skell began again but tros laugh
interrupted him

  like caesar i admire him more than
all the kings i ever met he is thp greatest
of romans compared to him skell you
are a rat that gnaws holes in a rotten ship
caesar is a scoundrel on a grand scale-a
gentleman who measures continents a
gold-and-scarlet liar whom you cant under-
standyou who would tell lies just because
your belly ached

  skell looked a mite bewildered but tros
grin was good natured so he tried again
let bygones be tros i am no such
fool as to believe in caesars friendship i

would sooner trust you though you call me
liar to my face why not pretend with me
to be caesars catspaws and snatch out a
nice fortune for ourselves

  tros stroked his beard reflectively it
formed no part of his philosophy to refuse
to make use of a rascal provided he could
keep his own hands clean skell was a
mere pawn in fortunes game not like cae-
sar who used fortune for his mistress and
debauched her with cynical assurance
there was nothing to be gained by trusting
skell but not much sense in incurring his
spite better to kill him and have done with
it than to cultivate his enmity and tros
preferred never to kill if he could help it

  you are afraid to go to lunden he
suggested by way of plumbing skells
thoughts

skell was about to answer
when the door of the cook-house
opened and the blue-eyed helma
came carrying a wooden dish of
wheat and meat her eyes fixed on it for fear
of spilling skell whistled softly to himself

  thatgirl is no serving wench he re-
marked eying the amber shoulder-orna-
ments and the gold wire on her girdle

 he seemed amused and before tros
could prevent him he was speaking to her
in the norse tongue she standing still be-
cause she could not carry the dish and look
upward at the poop what he said did not
please her tros noticed that

  skell jumped down from the poop and
took the dish from her holding it while she
climbed the ladder and then reaching up to
set it on the poop edge she had lifted it
again in both hands and was facing tros
before skell could climb up behind her

  she appeared to be trying to shame tros
by her meekness she a sea-kings daughtei
and he making her cook and fetch and carry
but tros curtly bade her set the dish down
sniffing for he could smell the stuff was
burned

  what did skell say he demanded
glaring at skell across her shoulder silently
daring him to interrupt

  does it matter what he says she re-
torted he is neither fish nor bird a bri-
ton who talks norse

  tell me tros insisted

  she turned and looked at skell and it
appeared that her contempt for him offset
her indignation at tros bruskness
prisoners of war

i

  he said i should look to him for friend-
ship

  so said tros sit down then skell
and eat with us i would like to hear more
about friendship ho there conops come
and eat and bring the northmen bid
those britons lay off pumping for an hour
unless the water makes too fast give
them bread and dry meat

  the giant sigurdsen refused food al-
though helma tried to tempt him but the
other northmen came and sprawled on
deck crowding the women away from the
dish tros sent conops for another plate
and heaped food on it for sigurdsens wife
and the widow but he made helma sit be-
side him whereat skell laughed

  she will not eat with the men he ex-
plained

  she will obey tros retorted and then
listened curiously while the northmen sang
a grace of some kind a melancholy chant
that had the dirge of seas in it and some-
thing of the roll of thunder

  when they had done he added a sunlit
wine-suggestive verse in greek being ever
respectful of other mens religions

  for a while they ate enormously using
their fingers tros stuffing food into helmas
mouth until she laughed and had to yield
with her face all smeared with gravy but
the laughter brought tears to her eyes and
she only kept on eating because tros in-
sisted shame at being made to eat with
men was swallowed by a greater grief and
tros began to pity her in his own bull-
hearted way

  your brother sigurdsen has made choice
and cast in his lot with me these other
northmen have no choice but are my men
henceforth now you shall choose he
told her there is skell and here am i
whose fortune will you follow i will give
you to skell if you wish

  her scorn for skell was so intense she
almost spat at him

  that half-breed she sneered you
may bestow me where you will tros for
that is your right but i will not die i will
live to see you writhe in ruin if you treat
me as less than a kings daughter i have
heard you are a princes son so i submit
to you although i hate you if i should
have to bear your children they shall be a
shame to me but a pride to you

  tros laid his huge hand on her shoulder

  peace he ordered

  talk of that kind was as foreign to him as
the northmens language that contained
no word he understood he was more per-
plexed about the girl than ever utterly un-
able to imagine what to do with her ab-
ruptly gruffly he changed the subject

  tell us this plan of yours skell how
would she and you make use of me
what is your friendship worth to her

  skell tried to grin ingratiatingly since
he had eaten tros food he had no fear of
violence the laws of hospitality were rigid
it was greater sin to break them than to
steal or to seduce a neighbors wife and un-
less tros were willing to incur contempt of
the meanest slave in britain he would have
to let skell get clear away before resuming
enmity

  caesar might love her skell answered
slyly caesar likes them young and well-
bred why not send her to caesar to love
him a while and make your peace with him

  who is caesar asked helma cheeks
reddening

  he will be emperor of all the world un-
less i succeed against him better than the
last two times tros answered caesar
and i are as fire and water but as to which
is which you must judge for yourself i
hate him as you hate me young woman
do you understand that

  she actually laughed her whole face
lighted with a new humor that trans-
formed it

  caesar might like you if you would let
him she answered and then looked away

  what else asked tros staring straight
at skell

  did i not speak of one of caesars light
o loves skell answered the woman
crossed from gaul with me in a boat that
lost its mast almost within hail of your
bireme take my advice and be rid of this
one before that one casts her hook into
your heart put this one to a wise use

  the womans name asked tros

  she was named cartisfindda but the
romans changed it to cornelia she carried
caesars message to glendwyr the briton
glendwyr plots against caswallon is ready
to pounce at the first chance you under-
stand now caesar can use you or ruin you
you and i and a handful of northmen to
help glendwyr-man we can help our-
selves to the loot of lunden town for a
beginning i say send this girl to caesar with
your compliments


adventure

  tros looked hard at helma there was
laughter in his eyes but skell could not see
that because he sat at tros right hand
will you go he asked her

as your enemy she answered yes
nay i have enemies enough in caesars
camp said tros did you hear her
skell you must think of another means of
making use of me

  but it had occurred to him he might make
use of skell are you afraid to come to
lunden

  skell looked frightened for a moment
he seemed to fear tros might take him
against his will until he remembered that
the ships were on the mud and he was tros
guest safe from violence

  i am a stranger to all fear he answered
and he could look the part he would have
deceived a man who did not know him

but the truth was skell was so
full of fear that he could be
trusted to change his plan at any
moment and never to tell the
truth -where he had opportunity to weave a
lie his was the dread that makes misers
and all meanness he felt himself a toad
beneath the harrow of misfortune who
could never afford to keep faith because of
the initial handicap with which he started
out in life	j

  he could recognize honesty-none more
readily than he-but only to try to take
advantage of it none less than he could cope
with subtlety that uses truth for bait and
candid explanations for a trap but sub-
tlety of that sort was tros instinctive
weapon

  skell he said you are a scoundrel
who would slit your friends throat for a
womans favor i am not your friend i
have but one throat and i need it i hope
you are caesars friend yet i would hate to
see a man like caesar brought to his end by

a-like you however that is caesars

problem and not mine

  skell tried to look offended but in his
heart he felt flattered as the smile in his
eyes betrayed tros noticed that and con-
tinued the same vein of frankness

  my difficulty skell is this that i have
fed you therefore you are my guest and
though i know you would never hesitate to
kill me if you could do it without danger
i dare not offend the gods by killing you
therefore i must make terms with you

but a bargain has two sides i am minded
you shall come to lunden

  why demanded skell

   because i like to have my enemies where

 i can see them

   and if i will not come

   you are afraid to come you fear cas-
wallon you know caswallon knows you
have intrigued with caesar yet you would
like to go to lunden because your house is
there and there are men who owe you
money whom you would like to press for
payment

  however it may be that jure is not
strong enough so i will add this am i a
man of my word skell yes you are
sure of that then listen if you refuse to
come to lunden i will spend if i must as
much as half of caesars money that became
mine when i took this bireme i will spend
it in cooking your goose for you

   i will set caswallon by the ears about
you and if all else fails me i will seek you
out and slay you with my own sword much
though it would irk me to defile good steel
in such a cowards heart do you believe
me

  and if i come to lunden skell in-
quired

  he was smiling he enjoyed to talk of
the issues of life and death when there was
no presently impending danger

  then i will concede this i will not move
 hand or tongue against you while you do the
 same by me i will tell caswallon you are
 a harmless rogue whose bark is far worse
 than his bite for as the gods are all around
 us skell that is my honest judgment of
 you

   i will tell caswallon you have done us all
 a service for that is true unless you had
 gone to gaul in hope of betraying me to
 caesar i could never have annoyed the
 roman there at seine-mouth

   skell i almost captured him so i will
 beg caswallon to ignore your treachery and
 if he should refuse i will protect you with
 my own guest-privilege

   skell meditated that a while his foxy
iron eyes kept shifting from face to face
avoiding tros but constantly returning to
study helma who was kneeling beside
sigurdsen aiding his distracted wife to soak
the stiffening bandages

   i mistrust your words skell said at
last you are a man who keeps a bargain
but you bind one craftily and i suspect a
prisoners of war

trick you must swear to me that there is
nothing hidden in these terms of yours

  not i tros answered i expect to
make my profit so do you skell i will
change no word of the agreement either
you come to lunden subject to my stipu-
lation or you go your own way and i will
rid the earth of you as swiftly as that first
duty can be done now choose-for i hear
oars-and the tide is turning

  skell also heard oars thumping steadily
down-stream toward the bireme

  i agree he said snapping his mouth
shut looking bold and almost carefree but
tros amber eyes discerned the nervousness
that underlay that mask

  conops whispered in tros ear tros
stood and glanced over the stern

  druids he said and began straighten-
ing his garments to receive them with proper
dignity they will be coming for my
fathers body heh but caswallon is a
true host friendship or no friendship see
in what state the druids come

chapter vi

a pretty decent sort oe god

the druids sang as they approached the
bireme in the bow of a long barge
under a bower of yew-branches there stood
an ancient of days bald-headed a white
beard flowing to his waist a golden sickle
in his girdle his white robe touching sandals
laced with golden thongs

  he led the chant young voices in the
stern caroled joyful almost bird-like regular
responses fourteen rowers droned a har-
monied accompaniment pulsing to the
rythm of the gilded oars serenely
solemnly they hymned the ever-nearness
of eternity there was not one note of grief

  the barge was draped in purple cloth and
the rowers wore sleeveless purple tunics over
their white smocks they who stood singing
in the stern were robed like the ancient in
the bow in white from head to foot and all
rowers included wore wreaths of mistletoe

  in the midst of the barge between the
rowers was a platform draped in white with
a wide gold border and over that a purple
canopy was raised on gilded rods the
sides of the barge were white adorned with
gilded scroll-work

  the rowers tossed oars and the barge
swung to a standstill under the biremes

stern but the chant continued tros and
his prisoners stood respectfully olaf si-
gurdsen supporting himself on the shoulders
of two men the northmens lips moved as
if they were trying to fit their own familiar
words to druid music that stirred their
pagan hearts as only battle and the north
sea storms and elemental mysteries could
ever do

  skell kept covering his face nervously
some half-familiar phantom had returned to
haunt his brain the women except helma
sobbed as if the sobbing brought relief to
tortured heart-strings but she stood still
beside tros brave-eyed almost glistening
vith emotions that not she herself could
have explained

  her shoulder touched tros arm and he
could feel a thrill that made his flesh creep
pleasantly he drew his arm away

  the hireling britons at the water-hoist
ceased work and stood by the bulwark
conops irreverent and practical threw a
rope over the stern but the druids ignored
it they held the barge to the bireme with
gilded boat-hooks while two of the rowers
drove long poles into the river-bed to serve
for an anchor at either end

  then they raised a wooden ladder with
bronze hooks that caught the biremes stern
rail and up that the old high-druid came
pausing at every step to roll out his majestic
hymn and wait for the response he came
over the taffrail singing moving his right
hand in centuries-old ritual as calmly as if
that were a temple threshold he hardly
touched tros proffered arm as he stepped
down to the poop

  there eyes on the horizon he stood
booming his hymn to eternity until eight
druids followed him over the stern he
needed no advice from tros caswallon
must have told him where the greater-than-
a-druids body was that he had come to
bear away with ancient honors

  he strode forward and down the short
ladder to the deck the other druids keeping
step behind him and when tros summon-
ing all his dignity swung himself down to
the deck to open the cabin door and show
the way a druid motioned him aside they
let no uninitiated hand have part let no
untaught eye see the rites they entered to
fulfil let none but druids hear their whis-
pered liturgy

  two druids stood outside the door their
backs to it lips moving signifying with a
adventure

nod to tros that he should keep his distance

   so tros stood leaning on his drawn sword
his head bowed until they came forth at
last bearing the body between them it was
no longer covered with caesars scarlet cloak
but robed in druids garments under a pur-
ple sheet and laid on a gilded stretcher

  the old high-druid swayed ahead of the
procession chanting they ascended the
poop-ladder hardly pausing skilfully pass-
ing the stretcher from hand to hand so that
the body they honored was always feet
first always horizontal paused on the poop
to chant a changed refrain then descended
the ladder to the barge with the rear end
of the stretcher hung in slings and no com-
motion or mismovement to disturb the dead
mans dignity

   the chanting rose to higher melody as if
they welcomed a warrior home when they
laid the body on the platform in the barges
midst then the old high-druid took his
stand beneath the canopy the rowers cast
off from the anchor-poles the barge moved
out into the stream and to a new chant
wilder and more wonderful the oarsmen
swung in unison until they vanished in a
crimson glow of sunset between autumn-
tinted oaks up river

   then tros broke silence

   thus not otherwise a soul goes forth
he said none knoweth whither they
bear it forth and there are they who shall
receive it

  he spoke greek only conops could have
understood the words and conops senses
were all occupied in watching skell and
helma trying to guess what mischief they
were brewing quietly he plucked tros
sleeve whispering

  master better give me leave to kill
that sly-eyed fox coax him forward of the
cook-house slip the knife in back of his

ear as for the woman-

   he did not offer to kill the woman he was
thrifty he knew her value

  -whip her whip her now before

she thinks you easy and does you a damage
take my advice master or she will cook a
mischief for you quicker than she burned
the stew

  the sun went down and in a haze of
purple twilight tros drew helma to the
starboard rail backing her against it

  what did skell say this time he de-
manded

   conops was listening hand on knife-hilt

watching skell who leaned over the far
rail whistling to himself the hireling sea-
men having pumped the bireme dry had
gone to the bow where they were half-
invisible like fantoms herded in the gloom
the tide was rising fast the broken oars
between the ships already creaked to the
longships motion but the bireme was still
hard and fast

  helma laughed mirthlessly but she
seemed to have recovered something of her
former spirit

  you are arrogant and i obey you tros
but i dont know for how long skell says
you are among enemies in britain he says
they will not let you keep your prisoners or
the longship he bade me notice how the
druids said no word to you

  tros laughed he knew the druids took
no part in personal disputes not interfering
much in politics the same law governed
all their ceremony nothing was allowed to
interrupt it

  go on he said what was skells
proposal

   skell said if i go with you i shall be sold
in open market by caswallons order

  tros knew that skell knew better even
should caswallon claim the prisoners de-
spite his recent gift of them to tros he
could not dispose of them like cattle without
incurring the wrath of the druids and the
scorn of a whole countryside but it was a
likely enough lie for skell to tell to a pris-
oner who might not know the british cus-
toms though she could speak the tongue
so what did skell suggest

  he said the britons will come and loot
these ships they will kill the men and
seize us women skell said if i obey him
he will protect me and take me to gaul
tros whistled softly nodding to himself
there was no hurry the longship floated he
could move her whenever he chose mean-
while skell had broken the guest-law and
he had excuse to kill him or to kick him over-
board conops read his gesture took a step
toward skell drawing his knife eight gleam-
ing inches from the sheath

  stay

tros seized him by the shoul-
fjjr-ssjgji der it was a dangerous game
to ea rouhly with a guest in
briton skell had eaten from
tros dish by invitation all the crew had
seen it a prisoners word that skell had
prisoners of war

voided privilege could carry no weight against
a free mans unless given under torture

  what answer did you make to skell
he demanded turning but keeping hold of
conops shoulder

  the girl laughed mirthlessly again i
would liefer die beside my brother than go
a half-breeds property to caesar

  come here skell tros commanded

  but he spoke too suddenly too fiercely
there was a splash as skell sprang overside
then tros ears caught what skell probably
had heard first-song and splashing in the
distance down stream he thought of the
arrow-engine but refrained and pushed co-
pops away from it conops urged but
tros knew his own mind

  let the rat run i have a notion not to
kill him

  notion conops muttered ive a
notion too well all be gutted by pirates
thats my notion

  skells boat left the biremes side in re-
sponse to his shouts and the britons who
had brought him hauled him out of water
straight away he set them paddling toward
the farther bank where he could lurk in
shadow out of sight of the approaching
boats whose crews sang drunkenly and
splashed enough for a considerable fleet
but there was no moon no stars only the
ghostly british gloaming deeply shadowed
and tros could not see them yet

  into the longship he commanded
all hands

  the hirelings in the bow demurred they
knew the time was come for looting tros
charged them beat them overside with the
flat of his long sword conops cut the lash-
ings that held the ships together there
was no talk needed to persuade the north-
men to flee from drunken longshoremen
they were overside before tros could count
their flitting shadows and tros had hardly
time to run for caesars cloak before the
longship yielded to the tide and drifted out
into the river

  for a while he let her drift and listened
he could still hardly see the approaching
boats but it was evident that their occu-
pants had seen the longships movement
they had stopped and were holding a con-
sultation paddling to keep their craft from
drifting nearer until they could decide what
the movement meant

  there was no wind the longship lay help-
less on the tide useless unless tros could

set his prisoners to work and make the
hirelings help them and if he should put the
northmen to the oars there would be none
to help him repel boarders

  yet there was no knowing what the end
might be if he should employ his prisoners
to defend a ship that had been theirs a
dozen hours ago they too might force
the hirelings to the oars and make a bid for
freedom he had given them back their
weapons they could overwhelm him easily

  but out of the darkness down the river
movement grew again the britons were
advancing on the bireme keeping silence
it was more than tros could stomach to see
pirates loot a valuable ship

  oars he ordered in a low voice out
oars

  conops leaped into the ships waist claw-
ing cuffing beating with his knife-hilt
until presently a dozen hirelings manned
the benches the remainder hugging bruises
in the dark

  too few tros muttered

  unused to those oars and that ship a
dozen men could hardly have provided
steerage way against the tide he could
count nearly a dozen boats creeping close
up to the bireme

  helma he commanded turning his
head to look for her

  the northmen except sigurdsen who
lay murmuring in delirium stood and
grinned at him helma was behind them
urging something speaking norse in sibilant
undertones

  helma he said again and his hand
went to his sword for the northmens grins
were over-bold

  one of them was arguing with helma
with what sounded like monstrous oaths

  to your oars he ordered gesturing

  none obeyed he seized the nearest
northman hurled him into the ships waist
spun around again to fight for dear life
drawing sword and lunging as he turned

  hold tros

  that was helmas voice ears were
swifter than his eyes he heard her in mid-
lunge and checked barely in time to let a
man give ground in front of him helma
sprang to his side then seized his sword-hilt
in both hands bearing down on it scream-
ing at the prisoners in norse

  he understood she was fighting for him
scolding screaming at her kinsmen to obey
and man the oars he caught the word
adventure

sigurdsen two or three times she was in-
voking her brothers name

  suddenly she let go tros sword and
fairly drove the northmen down in front of
her hurling imprecations at them then
watched tros watched what he would do
stood back in silence as he strode toward the
helm laughed when he seized it and stood
at gaze has left hand raised over his head
ready to signal the rowers

  the longship had drifted away from the
bireme stern-first and was now nearly beam
to the tide he signaled to the port oars
first to straighten her then tried three
strokes both sides together to feel what
strength and speed he could command
the tide was strong but they could move
her better than he hoped and he headed
half a dozen easy strokes inshore where
there was more or less slack water due to
reeds and lily-pads

  he could count nine boats now nosing
toward the bireme two or three had dis-
appeared inshore probably they were
creeping cautiously as if expecting ambush
as their noses touched the biremes shadow
tros shouted bringing down his left hand

 row yo-ho yo-ho yo-ho

  the longship leaped before the britons
in the boats could guess what the shout por-
tended a high prow notched against the
sky came boiling down on them jerking to
the strain of ash oars as conops beat time
with a ropes end on the hirelings backs
three boats backed away in time but six
crowded ones were caught by the longships
prow swept sidewise between the ships and
crushed against the biremes hull

  there were screams and a splintering
crash grinding of broken timber oaths con-
fusion in the longship where the rowers on
the port side fell between the benches a
long ululating cry from helma and the
longship swung alone down-river with a
boiling helm as tros threw all his weight
against the steering oar

  now again he shouted laughing
easier this time-with the tide

  but the rowers needed minutes to recover
equilibrium and breath there were two
men knocked unconscious by their own oar-
handles it took time to swing the long-
ship head up-stream tros roared his
orders helma screamed interpretation of
them conops plied the ropes end but be-
fore the longship could be headed on her
course again tros saw the remnant of the

fleet of boats scoot out of the biremes
shadow and race for the riverbank

  easy easy all he shouted and again
helma studied him curiously puckering her
eyes to see his face more clearly in the
gloom

  there were thumps oaths commotion in
the ships waist where conops fought three
britons unwisely they had sprung out of
the darkness from behind to pay him for the
ropes end but they missed with their first
onslaught so the outcome was inevitable
and tros paid no attention to that minor
detail he was studying the bireme mea-
suring with his eye the height of water up her
side she was still heeled just a trifle bow-
end firmly on the mud

ftp but there were noises along the
k-jjmr shadowy marshy shoreline

          owls half a dozen of them rose
into the night and vanished with
the weird swift flight that signified they
were afraid of something presently sparks
then a blaze then a whirl of red fire
as a man waved a torch to get it prop-
erly alight

  torch after torch was lighted from the
first one until the darkness fifty yards back
from the riverline grew aglow with smoky
crimson the commotion in the ships
waist ceased and conops came aft leaning
elbows on the low poop-deck

  all ready master he said calmly but
he was breathing hard and he snuffled be-
cause his nose was bleeding

  find a warp and come up here tros
ordered

  conops disappeared again tros sang
a yo-ho song to time the oarsmen giv-
ing just sufficient weigh to bring the ships
abreast then backing port oars with the
aid of helmas voice he swung the long-
ships stern until it almost touched the bi-
reme conops appeared then dragging a
wet rope cursing its religion in outrageous
longshore levantine-which was a mixture
of a dozen languages helma pounced on
it and helped him haul her muscles cracking
like a firebrand

  jump and make fast

  conops nearly missed for the longships
stern was swinging but he had tied a
small rope to the heavy warp and tied that
to his waist so he had two hands to clutch
the biremes stern he clambered up it
like a monkey and hauled the warp after
prisoners of war

him helma paying out the coils as the long-
ship drifted away beam to the tide tros
straightening her with slow dips of the port
oars

  make fast

  helma sea-kings daughter to the mar-
row of her young bones took three turns
around an oaken bollard in the stern and
held that until the warp began to feel the
strain paying out a foot or two until vibra-
tion ceased before she made fast to the
other bollard

  both banks-way tros thundered and
began his yo-ho song while helma beat
time and the mud boiled blue around them

  but the bireme stuck fast though the
longship swung and swayed heeling to one
side or the other as the humming warp took
the strain to port or starboard conops
yelled suddenly a torch came curving out
of darkness to the biremes deck followed
by yells from the longshore britons as
conops caught that one and tossed it over-
board then another torch and another

 row yo-ho yo-ho

  the ash oars bent and the rowers sweated
in the dark helma ran between the
benches whirling a ropes end beating the
britons backs no need to urge the north-
men they were working for dear life where-
as the britons were in favor of the longshore
pirates

  tros labored at the helm to keep the long
ship straight and haul the bireme off the
mud at the same angle that she struck
but the warp hummed and nothing hap-
pened except that torch followed torch so
fast that conops could hardly toss them
overboard

  then conops yelled again and vanished
like a bat toward the biremes bow there
was shouting splashing and a red glare
in the darkness at her bow-end-a thump
of wood and iron as conops levered the
great anchor clear and dropped it over-side
-yells as it fell on heads below

  then the glare increased they were
bringing more torches and burning brush-
wood a dozen arrows flitted through the
darkness near the longships poop tros
roared bull-throated to the rowers for a
final effort but they ceased drooped
gasping on their oars and the longship
slowly swung inshore as the warp held her
stern against the tide

  tros did not dare to let his crew of britons
get too near the riverbank they would

mutiny and join their friends nor could
he let the warp go he would have died
rather than leave conops at the mercy of
drunken savages

  now if lud of lunden would give me a
south wind-

  but lud did better he made some
one mad tros would have needed time
to set the sail a shadowy boat flitted
through the darkness and shot close up to
the biremes bow a flat blast on a cow-
horn split the night followed yelling
the red glare faded giving place to moving
shadows and din or argument conops re-
turned in leaps to the biremes stern and
shouted waving both hands

  way way yo-ho tros thundered

  helma plied the ropes-end the exhausted
oarsmen strained half-mutinous the long-
ship heeled and turned her head to mid-
stream until suddenly tros laid his whole
weight and strength on the steering-oar and
the bireme slid gently backward off the
mud the tide had lifted her at last

  they towed her stern-first for a mile
until the longshore shouting died in the dis-
tance then tros backed oars in a wide
reach of the river and lay alongside until
conops could make the warp fast in the bow
so as to bring the biremes head up-strearn

  who was it saved us he asked conops

  tide and a madman master skell
came over-river blew a horn-blast startled
them told them then he knew caesars gold
was in the bireme offered them half of it if
they would cut the warp and scare you off
before they set fire to anything kept them
talking until the tide crept under her this
lud of lunden is a pretty decent sort
of god

  aye lud of lunden aye tros mut-
tered aye i knew there was a reason
for preserving skell lud of lunden i
will make a little giftlet to that godlet i
believe he smiles on effort he shall
laugh

chapter vii

in lunden pool

a gray wet dawn was paling in the
sky when tros dropped anchor in the
pool below the ford by lunden town
caswallons mouse-hued wooden roof green-
splashed with lichen loomed through drift-
ing mist between the autumn-tinted oaks

  tros sighed for his sun-lit mediterranean
adventure

but he noticed that his northmen prison-
ers oar-weary though they were and stiff
from the fighting of the day before were in
an environment they liked

  they sniffed the autumn air leaned over-
side and praised the lush green meadows
nodded to one another sleepily as wooden
and thatched roofs barns and neat en-
closures peeped out of the mist a moment
to vanish again like dreams of fairyland the
lowing of cows asking to be milked appeared
to fill them with excitement they spoke
of wealth in whispers

  sigurdaens high fever had abated he
had slept like a child and now seemed hardly
to understand what had happened to him
his wife was talking in low tones he answer-
ing in grunts fingering the edge of the great
battle-ax that lay across his knees and glanc-
ing from his wife to helma who sat facing
him the other woman was still keening
her dead husband

  the lunden britons were late sleepers
not a human being stirred along the water-
front on either side of the river although a
dog howled a general alarm and a whole
pack joined him galloping from house yards
to patrol the river and bay indignant chal-
lenge to the skies there were several rot-
ting ships among the reeds all smaller than
the longship and not one even river-worthy

  this will never be a nation tros re-
flected there is no hope for them
think of bringing two ships into ostia
tarentum the piraeus smyrna alexan-
dria and none but a pack of dogs to give the
challenge they will be overwhelmed by
foreigners they will cease a hundred years
hence none will know the name of britain

  but he was nearly as tired out as his oars-
men and as conops in no true mood for
prophecy unlike them he might not
curl himself to sleep under the benches
he had no more fear on account of his brit-
ish hirelings who would stick like leeches
now until he paid them but he did not
propose to be caught asleep by any of cas-
wallons men who might remove his prison-
ers might even execute them especially if
caswallon should be away from home and
that seemed likely

  he thought it strange otherwise that
there should be none to receive him and
bid him welcome for the sake of good man-
ners however unfriendly they might feel
caswallon must have known he would
bring both ships up-river or-the thought

stirred tros to rumbling anger-had cas-
wallon left him purposely hard and fast on
the river mud in hope that longshore pirates
would wipe a difficulty off the slate to be
roundly punished for it afterward no doubt
since kings must punish criminals and
friendships must be honored when the
first hot flush of indignation died he de-
cided to give caswallon the benefit of that
doubt but he found it difficult knowing
that kings have harder work than other
men to keep faith subtler means of breaking
it and more excuse there was caesars
gold for instance

  when he had watched shore-bearings for
a while to make sure the anchor held he
turned to helma hoping to take his mind
off one worry by considering another

  how did you learn gaulish he asked
some of us always do she answered
dont we need it when we raid the coasts
i learned it from my nurse who was a briton
taken in a raid and carried off to malmoe
britons are good servants oncethey yield
she worked hard i loved her

  love or was it belly-yearning tros
asked i have heard tell that northmen
think of nothing else but fighting feasting
and taking wives

  none has had me to wife she retorted
and there was pride in her blue eyes such
as tros had never seen

  well-well you behaved last night he
said looking straight at her you are a
poor cook for you burned the stew but
you shall cook no more for me what
shall be done with you speak will you
return to malmoe

  she bit her lip then stabbed out words
like dagger-blades

  the men of helsing drove my brother
forth shall i return and serve them say-
ing that with my brothers ship i bought
myself to give to them

  you hate me why did you stand by
me in the pinch last night tros asked

  i am a sea-kings daughter should i
side with pirates she demanded

  what were you when you raided the
thames or when you burned a south coast
village tros inquired

  good norse stock she retorted we
are vikings

   vikings the word means literally creek-men and is
probably a great deal older than the period of this story
originally a term of contempt it ended like similar words in
other languages by being proudly adopted by those whom
it was coined to offend
prisoners of war

  tros was puzzled

  what if i should take you back to mal-
moe and try an issue with the men of
helsing and reestablish you what then

  ah you laugh at me but there was
no laughter in his eyes and she was watch-
ing them you might make my brother a
king again for you are a bold man and you
can handle a ship but the scalds would
call me a black-haired foreigners wife until
the very serving-wenches mocked me

  said i one word about wifing tros
asked astonished

  but she was astonished too backed away
two steps from him looking as if he had
struck her with a whip

  i am a prisoner by my brothers oath of
battle i must abide that she answered
you are a prince have you a wife

  no said tros watching her

  he knew now she was much more puzzled
than he had been

  you will not degrade me she said with
an air of confidence

  she implied they had both been talking
in a foreign tongue and so could hardly un-
derstand each other biting her lip again
she calmed herself made a nervous effort
to be patient with him

  i will speak with olaf sigurdsen said
tros and strode to where the northman
leaned against the stern all swathed in
bandages nervously thumbing his ax-hilt

  but sigurdsen knew no gaulish other
than the words for mast and oar beef beer
and a dozen place-names helma had to
stand there and interpret

  what shall i do with her tros asked
signifying helma with a sidewise motion of
his head

  she is yours said the northman as-
tonished you won her

  helma interpreted mimicking even the
voice-note suddenly as if she thought
tros had not understood yet she pulled off
her amber-and-gold shoulder ornaments and
thrust them toward him

  have you a wife asked sigurdsen

  helma translated sigurdsens wife stood
up beside her husband staring at tros as if
he were some new kind of creature she had
never heard of she began whispering and
sigurdsen nodded spoke with a note of
grandeur in his voice

  what does he say tros demanded

  he says-you returned him his weapon
you accepted his oath as a free man but

you did not say you returned me to him
nevertheless perhaps you meant that
therefore he being my brother and a kings
son although without fief or following and
you his conqueror in battle and his sworn
friend he swears by thor and odin and
his ax-blade i am born in noble wedlock and
a fit bride and he gives me to you to be
wife and to share your destiny on land and
sea

  zeus

no thought of marrying had

ever entered tros head except
as something he would never do
he made no oath but he had
seen too many men grow fat and lazy in the
meshes of a family not to promise himself he
would die free of womans ministering he
had something of his fathers conviction
that marriage was earthy of the earth a
good enough thing for the rabble but a trap
that kept a strong soul from aspiring to the
heights

  sigurdsen spoke again not knowing who
zeus might be not understanding the ex-
plosion he had never heard of a mans
refusing a kings daughter

  she is fair she is young she is a vir-
gin call her wife before the britons come
and men speak ill of her

  helma had to translate she did it in wo-
manlywise her blue eyes-they were more
blue than the northern sky-accepting
destiny as something to be met and very
proudly borne

  i think you did not understand me yes-
terday she said nor i you you are a
brave man tros and i will bear you sons of
whom you shall not be ashamed

  brave tros felt as weak as a seasick
landsman he was ashamed he might
refuse and he would hate himself he
might accept and learn to hate the woman
he might give her to some other man and
evermore regret itw why had he taken pris-
oners why hadnt he made a gift of them
to caswallon when he had the chance

  slowly-he was striving to hear the inner
voice that usually guided but either the
inner man was deaf or the voice was sleep-
ing he let his left hand leave his sword-
hilt he did not know why she stepped
closer smiling both arms stretched to-
ward the girl before he knew it she came
into them her head on his breast and at
that very moment conops wakened
adventure

  master

  it was the exclamation of a man bereft
of faith in the one eye that caesars torturers
had left him love-and-run in half the
ports of the levant was conops history
brief interludes of lazy days and tavern-
haunting nights between long spells of hard-
ship and service to tros on land and sea
loose superstitious morals for himself but
rigorous aloofness for his master from all
worldly ways was his religion he had but
one eye because he had dared to rebuke
caesar for insulting tros he rubbed the
other one crestfallen as if the tros he
knew were gone and some one substituted
whom he could not recognize

  tros with a girl in his arms he could
not believe it he came and glared the
tassel of his red cap down over his empty
eye the long tooth sneering through the
slit in his upper lip blood on his nose from
yesterday he fingered his long knife he
sidled three-quarters of a circle around
helma as if looking for an un-witch-pro-
tected opening through which to drive his
knife

  master and your father not buried
he said hardly reproachfully rather as if
he did not believe his senses

  he was jealous-jealous as a harbor-
strumpet of a rival light o love the
slobber blew in bubbles on his lean lips j

  dionusus

  tros was in no mood to be reproved by a
servant he let out a lick with his fist-
caught conops on the ear and sent him
sprawling between the oar-benches

  dog he thundered will you judge
your betters

  conops did not hear that he lay hug-
ging his bruised head grateful for it glad
of anything that drove the greater anguish
out of mind rocking himself moaning
knees and elbows bunched

  angry-for emotions such as tros had
come through turn to anger as the sour
milk turns to whey-tros swung his hands
behind him and stood breast out grim chin
high staring at the shore ignoring helma
she was the real irritant he told himself
it was not born in him to love a woman if
he had thought he loved her-had he-
that was only the emotion of a drunken
sailor worse it was sordid backsliding
a descent from his own olympian heights
of manhood to the common level of un-
moral fools like conops

  what would old perseus have said to it
hah old father perseus did the same
thing didnt he tros wondered who his
own mother had been and by what means
she had wheedled a middle-aged saint into
the snares of marriage

  tros knew she had died when he was
born but others had told him she was a
royal woman born of a line of kings whose
throne was overturned by rome perseus
had forbidden speech of her and as usual
tros had obeyed only listening when other
men dropped information

  her death as far as perseus was con-
cerned had closed a lifes chapter thence-
forth he had preached celibacy not failing
to instill into his son a wholesome-was it
wholesome-dread of women or rather of
the love of women and of the loss of spiritual
vision that ensued from it

  yet here am i said tros his hands
clenched tight behind him but for
perseus and a woman i should not have
been i live by zeus and the immortal
gods i laugh

  but he did not laugh it irked him that
helmas eyes were on his back he wished
he had struck conops harder he wished
all lunden would awake and come down to
the waterside he would have welcomed
anything just then anything to save him
the necessity of speech with helma he
hated the girl she and destiny between
them had made a fine fool of him

  yet as he turned to meet her gaze a new
shame reddened his cheeks under the bronze
he realized he did not hate her he knew
he would be ashamed to withdraw the un-
spoken pledge he had made when he took
her in his arms she was his wife he
wished he had killed conops

he held out his hand to her
with a stubborn gesture drew her
beside him made her stand hand-
in-hand with him there on the
ships stern gesturing to olaf sigurdsen to
rouse his northmen and when they had
rubbed sleep out of their eyes they stood
up grinning until it dawned on them that
something else was due

  sigurdsen led the cheering then shaking
his great battle-ax and the din carried over-
water to the houses near the riverbank so
that a dozen britons came to stare hitching
their ungainly looking trousers

  presently-being britons who would
prisoners of war



rather ride a dozen miles than walk one-
horsemen came riding bare-backed mounts
into the river a yellow-haired expert swam
his horse all the way out to the longship
and mounted the stern leaving the horse
to swim where it chose

  lud love you he said grinning patting
himself to squeeze water from his clothes
he eyed helma appraisingly norse girls
are good those cursed red sea-robbers
steal more of ours than we ever see of theirs
though wife or ransom he asked not
pausing for an answer caswallon took
some prisoners but they say theres no hope
of ransom some other gang of pirates drove
them forth so they came to seize holding
in britain no homes-no friends still-
is she a virgin

  shes a well-bred filly those north-
men who raided her home might like to pay
a long price for her lud love me is that
sigurdsen what have you done to him
tros he fought his way out of the woods
without a scratch on him whats he doing
with his ax hes a prisoner isnt he lud
look at them theyre all armed whos
the prisoner-you

  where is caswallon tros asked him

  over on the hilltop with the druids
hours away loving the wounded you know
wants to be popular but it wont work
there are too many who say he shouldnt
have fitted out your expedition sixty or
seventy killed and maimed lud think
of it as if these bloody northmen werent
trouble enough

  and theres a woman from gaul-wait
till you see her youll soon forget that one
tros she had a letter for you from caesar
caswallon burned it in a rage but she says
she knows what caesar wrote and shell tell
you caswallon didnt dare to treat her
roughly because half of us fell hide-and-
hoof in love with her and there are plenty
who say he ought to make terms with
caesar

  she says you and caesar understand
each other and we all want to know what
caesars terms are skell came shortly after
midnight wandered all over town trying
to wake people but we were too tired to
listen to him besides skell is a liar hes
in his own house now i saw the smoke as
i came by

  skell said tros

  yes skell the box you packed off to
caritia to talk to caesar skell the liar

skell who said you helped him to wreck
caesars fleet although everybody knew you
did it all alone why didnt you kill him
tros skell said something last night about
having saved you in the river-longshore-
men or something nobody believed him
he said youd sent him ahead to warn us
all not to listen to anything caswallon says
until weve heard you

  where is fflur tros asked when the
youngster paused for breath

  with caswallon getting in the druids
way i suppose helping to hurt the wounded
what are you going to do with this ship
burn it say-thats a good idea burn
both ships make a floating bonfire in the
pool tonight tonights the funeral all
the countryside in procession from lunden
to the burying-ground chariots torches
they say your fathers corpsell be right in
front ahead of everything except old long-
beard why not have a bonfire of two
ships when we come back something to
show caesars woman show her we britons
can stage a circus too

  he paused for breath again

  where is orwic tros inquired

  nursing himself and trying to rule
lunden caswallon left him in charge
but orwic isnt popular just now-lost too
many men on your expedition everybody
says it must have been his fault and no
loot-didnt bring a stick of loot back with
him from gaul

  everybody says caswallons nephew
is caswallons man and the chief hasnt
been popular these ten days past besides
why did orwic wait so long before he came
to help us in the woods say did you see
me cut down three northmen on the run
right down by the riverbank there where
the muds deep and the thicket goes clear
to the water

  theyre trying to make out now that
i had help three men claim they were in
that with me but maybe you saw from
across the river did you maybe you can
swear i did it single-handed three great
brutes of northmen as big as sigurdsen
there did you hear the first one roar when
i stuck a spear in him

  the other two went down silent but the
first one made noise enough for all three
did you hear him their weapons and
armor are held for prize-court and those
othersll lie me out of them unless you can
uphold me can you
adventure

  tros did not answer orwics boat came
hurrying out of the reeds and orwic hailed
him

  lud exclaimed the visitor wheres
my horse gone no matter

  he plunged into the river and swam shore-
ward orwicj standing in a boats stern
could not help but see him he stared hard
watched the yellow head go rippling like
a water-rat but said nothing he boarded
the longship saluting tros with a genial grin
that nevertheless not more than masked
a feeling of restraint

  skell is here he said pursing his bps
staring hard at helma so is cornelia a
gaulish woman with roman paint on her
she says she knows you tros

  she lies she lies tros answered
calmly

  so does skell said orwic but they
both he artfully the woman says caesar
has appointed you his agent here in britain
skell says he preserved you from the river-
pirates in return for which you and he made
peace he says you grant him the pro-
tection of your privilege is that true is
there any truth in it

  you were with me orwic you heard
all i said to caesar

  aye but i know no latin tros i
know you called me off when i was hard at
caesar with eight men in the biremes bows
what about skell did you promise him
anything

  tros grew hot under the bandages that
swathed his head he tore them off

  i promised you my friendship he said
grimly

  yes i know you did you beat me in
fair fight and i took your hand tros
havent i stood by you since caswallon
is your friend too but dont forget tros
caswallon is king here and you are a
foreigner your life and your goods are in
our safe-keeping but if you make diffi-
culties for us we must think of ourselves
first

  if i am not welcome i will go tros
answered

  orwic hesitated stroking his mustache
tros thought leaped to the chest of caesars
gold that fflur caswallons wife was sup-
posed to be keeping for him thoughtfully
he eyed his northmen prisoners and won-
dered whether he could manage the long-
ship with that scant crew there was the
belgian coast he might make that and

there was the unknown norse country that
his bones almost ached to explore

  i would bid you go orwic said at last
but i dare not there are too many now
who believe you bring caesars message and
they want to hear it there are too many
who accuse caswallon of having sent you
to make overtures to caesar too many
again who believe the contrary and blame
caswallon for having sent you to stir caesar
against us we are all divided

  some say caswallon looks to caesar to
make him king over all britain others say
caesar will conquer britain first and crucify
caswallon afterwards there are some who
want to kill you tros and some who want
to honor you as caesars messenger

  what say the druids tros asked
that they will bury your fathers body
and that unless we can persuade you there
will be none to answer all these tales they
say if you should go then all men would
declare caswallon was afraid of you and
would turn against him but if you should
stay britons will be at one anothers throats
within a day or two

  he paused a moment watching tros eyes
steadily then suddenly advanced with a
dramatic gesture

  tros i speak you frankly if we cas-
wallons friends should treat you as less
than an honored guest your life would be
in danger from our own hot-heads who are
ready to admire you if caswallon does or
to hate you if he doesnt they will follow
his lead

  but if we honor you then caswallons
enemies will hurl that as a charge against
him nevertheless those same men will
befriend you if you let them and make use
of you to attack caswallon wtiat do you
say tros

  i what should i say tros answered
what do i care for the feuds of briton
against briton i come to attend my
fathers funeral

  are you caesars man asked orwic

tros flew into a rage at that
he clenched his fists and an-
swered in a voice that made the
northmen jump and brought
conops knife in hand from between the
benches

  no by zeus and the dome of heaven
no do you understand what no means
rot you and your muddy lud of lunden
prisoners of war



rot you all i vomit on you caesar may
help himself to your wives and children
let him enslave you what do i care
war-r-r-ugh you bickering fools-town
against town-you are worse than my own
greeks

  do you listen to your druids no do
you listen to your chiefs no what do you
listen to your belly-rumblings you believe
your colic is a cosmic urge you think your
island is the middle of the universe

  you accuse your friends and make love
to your enemies you and your chariots
look at your ships there rotting look at
me- tros struck his breast-i grieve
look at me i weep why on your
account the gods forbid it i hope caesar
treads you underfoot i grieve that my
fathers dust must mingle with the dirt of
britain wo is me wo that i ever set foot
in britain

  peace said orwic but tros turned
away from him shaking with fury

  his violence had reopened the wound on
his cheek and helma stanched the blood
using the bandage he had tossed aside
conops whispered to him he struck conops
hurling him headlong again between the
benches then black with anger he strode
up close to orwic hands behind him

  tell caswallon i attend my fathers
funeral say this by zeus ill solve his
difficulties can he fight is he a man
hah let him believe either me or else
skell and these other liars let him waste
no time about it if he chooses to call me
an enemy he shall fight me before all
lunden

  orwic forced a smile and tried to pour
the oil of jest on anger

  how would that help they would say
you fought him for the kingdom tros

  caswallons kingdom i that for it
tros spat into the river hah barter
my freedom for the right to be disobeyed
and chorused by long-haired horse-copers
gods listen to him tell caswallon i
wouldnt thank him for what he calls his
kingdom tell him i doubt his friendship
bid him haste and prove it or else fight me
go tell him

  tros those are unwise words said
orwic

  they are mine this is my sword
tros answered tapping the gilded hilt of his
long weapon

  tros you and i swore friendship

  swore what is a mans oath worth
show me the friendship

  tros i spoke you fair i only told you
how the matter lies i asked an honest

question

  zeus i gave an honest answer call
me friend or enemy by zeus it means
nothing to me which way a fish jumps
your eyes burn you are tired tros
aye tired of you britons and your
ways am i caesars man ye gods of
sea and earth get off my ship

  but orwic did not move except to smile
and hold his hand out

  nay tros i rule lunden in caswallons
absence welcome to lunden i speak in
caswallons name

  he showed a great ring on this thumb
tros glared at it

  i know you are not caesars man said
orwic

  at which tros flew into another fury
pantheon of heaven you you know
that you who saw me wreck all caesars
ships you who were with me at seine-
mouth and saw me rape caesars lair you
who saw my fathers tortured body you
you know i am not caesars man-because
i said it

  orwic smiled again his hand outheld
you will admit tros that you said it
with a certain emphasis a man may be
excused if he believes you

  take my message to caswallon

  i stand in caswallons place i speak
for him i have received the message i
prefer to call you friend

  words again tros asked

  he felt disappointed he had enjoyed
the burst of anger in the moments mood
it would have suited him to carry challenge
to conclusion

  no more words said orwic give me
your hand tros there

  he stepped close and embraced him
smearing his own cheek with tros blood

  welcome to lunden now i go to make
a good room ready for you in caswallons
house

  young cockerel brave young cockerel
tros muttered watching him overside then
turning suddenly to helma

  that is the man you should have mar-
ried shall i give you to him orwic is the
best bred cockerel in britain

  she looked puzzled wondering whether
he imagined that was humor


adventure

  i am pledged to you tros

  i will free you

  no he is only a briton you are a
sea-king i will bear your sons

  zeus he muttered wondering has
all the world gone mad come here he
ordered

  when she came he kissed her and conops
cried shame at him from beneath an oar-
bench it was a dawn of mixed emotions
as opaque and changing as the lunden mist

chapter viii

cornelia of gaul

so tros prisoners-since he had freed
them and they were now his hench-
men-became caswallons guests along with
tros in the great house on the hill top in
caswallons absence orwic showed them
almost too much courtesy to the annoyance
of servants and fair-haired british men-at-
arms who luonged in the great hall or amused
themselves at horse-play in the yard

  but it gave the northmen an enormously
high opinion of tros and when orwic
brought out caesars treasure chest so that
tros might pay off his hireling seamen even
sigurdsen began to boast of being tros
adherent and helma put on airs toward the
british women who were friendly enough
until she began almost to patronize them

  so the britons brought forth horses and
compelled the northmen to try to ride
mounting them two on a horse and into the
deriding mob of onlookers cornelia came
attended by a crowd of young bloods dressed
in their choicest finery wearing enough gold
and bronze and amber among them to have
overpaid one of caesars legions for a year

  while they were laughing at the north-
mens efforts to ride half-broken stallions
scared into a frenzy by men who despised
the sea as only fit for fishermen cornelia
studied tros from a distance

  he had done paying his hirelings and was
counting the rest of the gold or rather pre-
tending to count it watching her between-
whiles as adroitly as she watched him each
avoiding the others eyes gathering her
escort around her at last she made her way
outside the crowd toward where tros sat
on a chair on caswallons porch

  she walked with dignity that she had
imitated from the romans her dress and
jewelry were roman aping the patrician

style pure white with a golden border and
she showed no trace of having suffered on
her stormy way from gaul her dark hair
glistened in a net that held it massed behind
her neck gilded sandals decorated rather
than concealed her feet she looked ex-
pensive and calmly impudent but her
stock-in-trade was nothing tangible al-
though it was all in evidence an air of
knowing more than anybody else knew of
having influence that none could under-
mine of laughing at life because she held
the keys of fortune

  those keys too were evident brown eyes
beneath long dark lashes carmine daring
not exactly scornful but mocking lips a
figure that suggested limitless immodesty
beneath cultured poise a gown that clung
precisely where it should cling to excite emo-
tion when she moved with that apparently
unstudied ease

  tros knew her type helma did not and
stood nearer to him light of northern sky
blazing under flaxen brows norse jealousy
hardening her young face helma was
afraid tros felt her trembling when her
elbow touched his but the gaulish woman
with the roman name had trained herself
in far too many swift intrigues to show fear
even if she felt it rome had made a hun-
dred conquests in the wake of women of her
genius and before rome nineveh inborn
in her was all the grace of courts and all the
spirit of destruction

  the noble tros she asked coming to a
stand in front of him not trespassing yet on
caswallons porch

  and tros was not yet minded that she
should he did not rise he kicked his
long sword outward so thaf its hilt rested
on his knees and he could lay both hands on
it leaning back in the chair to stare insolent-
ly through suspicious slumberous eyes

  my name is tros

  i am cornelia

   caesars light o love he asked raising
shaggy black eyebrows just sufficiently to
barb the insult caesars slave

  helma behind him touched his shoulder
gratefully conops seated on caesars
treasure-chest showed three more teeth
through the slit in his upper-lip rose and
disappeared into the house

  caesars messenger the gaulish woman
answered

  there was no iron in her voice nothing
but challenging laughter caesar had not
prisoners of war



picked a thin-skinned fool to pave romes
way to conquest

  conops came out of the house with
caesars scarlet cloak and draped it on tros
shoulders helma assisting to arrange it
half-guessing its significance although she
did not know that tros had looted it along
with the romans bireme

  the young britons who had appointed
themselves cornelias body-guard began to
whisper to her one of them grew bold and
raised his voice-

  tros your insolence insults us all
tros sneered his mood was cynical
orwic came out of the house to stand be-
hind him orwic being in authority just
then the crowd grew still until cornelia
spoke in latin

  caesars cloak tros you foreshadow
caesar he will take that for an omen
when i tell him tros sat cloaked in im-
perial scarlet on the porch of caswallons
house

  they talk latin some one shouted
tros is caesars man

  there were more than a hundred people
by that time on the green before caswallons
house not counting the stable-hands and
other serfs who were hardly to be reckoned
with not daring to offend their betters
some were men who had come too late to
fight the northmen jealous of the victors
spoils and very anxious to assert them-
selves

  a tumult began a few of them denouncing
tros as an intriguer some shouting that
caesars message should be heard a noisy
small group nearest to the gate and safety
denounced caswallon orwic swore under
his breath using the names of a dozen
celtish gods tros whispered to conops
bid my northmen gather themselves
behind the house and enter it from the rear
take charge of them add yourselves to
orwics men be swift

  then he turned to orwic

  now or never he said with a careless
shrug of his shoulders is caswallon king
in lunden gently boy gently not yet
leave this to me i will show you who
rules this end of britain

  he stood up letting his face light with
laughter gathering caesars scarlet cloak
around him he addressed cornelia but in
a voice that all the crowd could hear and he
spoke slowly in gaulish as if answering her
speech and taking care that all should un-

derstand him in spite of his foreign accent
aye woman this was caesars cloak
you who were caesars light o love until he
sent you to cozen me were not so very
clever when you recognized it i am told
you brought me a letter from caesar i am
told caswallon burned it i am told you
are warning the britons not to listen to cas-
wallon until they first hear me well
they shall hear me now i am caswal-
lons guest

he could hear a tramping

through the house behind him as
tie northmen came with conops
to reenforce orwics men there
was a noise of weapons being lifted from the
racks

  caesar sent you to me are you ready
orwic he whispered march out and
surround her when i give the word there-
fore you are mine i will see that none
perverts you from right conduct in the
realm of him who is host to both of us
come he commanded beckoning

  cornelia appealed to her escort too late
orwic took the cue and rushed from the
porch with forty men-at-arms behind him
twelve of them northmen very anxious to
repay bruises done at horse-play it was
risky work the northmen fierce enemies a
day ago were likelier than not to cause in-
dignant bloodshed safety lay in doing the
work so swiftly that there would be no time
for a crowd without a leader to decide
whether it really was indignant or was half-
amused

  conops and the northmen surrounded
cornelia orwic and his britons who thrust
themselves between the northmen and her
british escort joining spears before them
like a fence-rail forcing the astonished
escort backward on their heels and while
orwic accomplished that tros shouted
throwing up his right arm shaking caesars
scarlet cloak to distract attention to himself
ho there caswallons friends there
is a rat named skell who brought this
caesars woman to cheat away your freedom
where is skell

  caswallons friends were fewer than his
enemies in that crowd but the impulse of
sbrprize was in their favor by the time
cornelia had been hustled into the great hall
in the midst of a group of grinning north-
men who handled her none too gently the
loyalists had started a diversion shout and


adventure

counter-shout that served until orwics
summons on a silver bugle brought a dozen
chariots charging from the stable to clear
the green of friend and enemy alike the
crowd did not even try to stand against the
chariots although the front ones had no
scythes fixed to the wheels but there
were two chariots in the rear that could
have mown a crimson swath

  and now swiftly said tros when or-
wic strolled back to the porch trying to look
self-possessed where are those north-
men prisoners caswallon took in the fight in
the forest

  what of them there are only three-
and-twenty some of them pretty badly
hurt said orwic

  where are they i know mobs your
britons will say that it was northmen who
snatched that woman away they will kill
those three-and-twenty then they will
come to kill my twelve and sigurdsen then
me then you

  bah who cares if they kill northmen 
orwic answered

  i for one blood-lust grows they will
kill caswallon next smuggle those pris-
oners to this place start a hue-and-cry at
skells heels that fox will give them a run
to keep all lunden busy send for caswal-
lon then and bid him hurry bid him
bring fflur with him

  orwic hesitated but tros took him by
the shoulders

  am i friend or enemy he thundered
boy that woman will win britain for
caesar yet unless you act swiftly

  orwic yielded only half convinced and
hujried away to instruct his friends shut-
ting the great gate and posting guards to
keep another crowd from forming tros
strode into the house swaggering as if he
owned it cornelia was seated near cas-
wallons great chair under the balcony at
one end of the hall her dress was ruffled and
a little tom but she was laughing at the
men who stared at her and she mocked
tros gesturing at helma

  ah you seize me when you have that
beautiful fair-haired prisoner what use

for poor me when-

  i have a use for you tros interrupted
and the hall grew still you were caesars
slave now you are mine

  she was startled but the scared look
vanished in an instant she had the profes-
sional intriguers self-control it was helma

who turned pale and came and stood beside
tros watching his face

  tros said the woman of gaul speaking
latin caesar told me you are proud and
full of guile and a great keeper of rash
promises you promised him enmity you
wrecked his fleet you forged caesars
name and stole your father from the grip of
three camped legions

  that was an indignity to rome as well as
caesar you sunk caesars boats you slew
his men you ducked caesar himself in the
tide at seine-mouth so you kept your
rash promise

  yet caesars magnanimity is greater
than the malice that pursues him he is
willing to forgive he offers you full recog-
nition by the roman senate and command
of fifty ships if you withdraw your enmity
and promise him allegiance i am caesars
messenger not your slave

  tros answered her in gaulish-

  when i need fifty of caesars ships i will
take them without his leave or romes

  but that was for the britons ears he
had in mind more than to bandy words

  tros- she began again

  silence he commanded

  then he pointed to the door of an inner
room between the great hall and caswal-
lons quarters helma bit her lip and
several of the men-at-arms laughed loud
but tros kept on pointing and he looked
imperious in caesars scarlet cloak

  so cornelia rose out of her chair bowed
smirked almost imperceptibly at helma
and let the way in through the door glanc-
ing over-shoulder in a way that gave tros
pause he beckoned hehna

  bring your brothers wife and the
widow he commanded

  so three norse women followed tros into
the dimly ugh ted room and one of them
knew gaulish there were benches in
there for men-at-arms and one chair on
which cornelia sat uninvited arranging her
draperies to show the shapely outline of her
figure

  tros slammed the door and slid the wood-
en bolt in place with a nod to helma and
the other women to be seated on the bench-
es he seized cornelias chair then and
dragged it into the shaft of light that fell
through the one small window he craved
sleep and had not time to waste

  turn your face to the light he com-
manded keep it so now no evasionsl
prisoners of war



i am in no mood to split thin hairs of
courtesy

   truly tros your courtesy is thin she
answered caesar is never discourteous
even to his enemies i was told you are a
princes son where you were born are
manners thought unmanly

  answer this he rapped his sword-
hilt on a table that he dragged up to the
window-light what was written in
caesars letter that caswallon took from
you and burned

  she smiled and tossed her head i gave
it to the lord caswallon he had man-
ners he was too polite to take it from
me

  what was written in the letter

  since the letter was burned what mat-
ters what was written in it

  her dark eyes dared him

   tros drew his sword his great chin com-
ing forward with a jerk he let the sword-
point fall until it touched her bare throat

  answer me

  her eyes turned slightly inward as she
looked along the sword-blade toward the
marvelously steady hilt but she did not
wince the sword-point pricked the skin
she did not even flinch from it

  i will not tell and you dare not kill
me

  tros let the sword-point fall until it
touched her naked foot between the crossed
thongs of her sandal a dancing-womans
foot was where her fear might lie closest to
the surface but she laughed

  before these women tros what would
the britons say to you caesar may torture
women and you might-though i think not
for i see a weakness-but the britons dont
even whip their children would caswal-
lon forgive you if you should nail my foot
to the floor in his house

mggs tros owned to the weakness
se divined in him he could
kill in cold blood or in anger but
v- the very thought of torture made
him grit his teeth the half of his hatred of
caesar was due to his contempt for caesars
practises he liked the britons because they
did not practise cruelty

  but he could be cruel in another way
compunction that prevented torturing man
or woman implied no inhibition against
mental terrorism he could hardly bear to
see a fish gaffed if the hook would serve and

could not kill a cur like skell unless his own
life were in danger but he could be as ruth-
less as the sea as practical as fate in match-
ing means to ends

  his eyes changed and the woman noticed
it he glanced at helma

  bring my man conops he commanded
and he set his sword-point on the floor be-
tween his feet to lean on it and wait

  he did not have to wait long as helma
drew the bolt the door swung inward
conops lurched into the room shielding his
head with his arm in fear of the blow he
had earned by eavesdropping too wise in
his masters ways to offer an excuse

  when the blow did not fall he peeped
over his arm then dropped the arm blinked
his eye and grinned knowing danger was
over tros punishments were prompt or
else not meted out at all

  news tros asked him

  none master only i heard say they
are hunting skell and a chariot went for
caswallon

  caswallon is coming eh have you a
wife

  tros knew the answer but he chose that
cornelia should learn the truth from con-
ops lips

  no master-surely you know that
the last woman i--

  a frown convinced him he had said
enough

   tros turned to cornelia

   this man is no beauty is he he is not
well bred his manners are of the fore-
peak quality he disciplines a woman
with a knife-hilt he is single he is old
enough to marry he would serve me
better if he had a wife to keep him from
longshore escapades i will give you to
conops to be his wife-his wife you under-
stand me conops is a free man he can
own a wife

  he had her she was out of the chair
indignant terrified appealing to the other
women ready to scream in a panic strug-
gling to control herself tros threat was
something he could easily fulfil since she
was his by all the written and unwritten
laws

   if she should claim that she was caesars
slave then tros as caesars enemy might
do as he pleased with her by right of cap-
ture she having been sent to use her wiles
on him not on caswallon if she should
declare herself a free-woman she might fool
	adventure

britons but not tros who knew the roman
law and knew thfc-dreadf ul penalties that even
caesar who had sent her would be forced
to inflict should she be returned to him
branded a slave who had claimed to be free

  if tros should make a gift of her to con-
ops the britons might be offended but
there would be no chance of their interfering
marriage by gift was binding all the more
so if the woman were a slave or a prisoner of
war she would not become conops slave
because he might not sell her she would be
bound to him for life promoted or reduced
to his rank-considering it promotion or re-
duction as she pleased-in theory free in
practise a sailors drudge

conops was as much alarmed as she was
master he exploded what use is
she on a ship why she cant even cook

shes-

  peace you drunken blabbing fool
when i give you a wife youll take her and
be grateful or ill break your head think

yourself lucky to-

  but she who had been caesars light o
love could not face life with conops

  i will tell tros she said and sat down
on the chair again shuddering you will
not give me to that one-eyed thing

  tros nodded grunted he hated to bar-
gain with her but on the other hand it
would have gone against the grain to ruin
conops by imposing such a wife on him

  what caesar wrote to you tros it was
meant that the lord caswallon should read
it was supposed that some one some druid
would know latin and translate it to him
but the lord burned the letter

  what did caesar write tros thun-
dered at her and why in latin

  he wrote lord tros that he trusted
you as agreed between you and him at
seine-mouth to stir up the britons against
the lord caswallon in return for which he
promised as agreed to confer high com-
mand on you so soon as sufficient britons
should recognize the advantage of welcom-
ing the roman legions into britain he
concluded by reminding you of your pledge
that there shall be no opposition to his land-
ing on the coast of britain when he comes
again and he charged you to that end to
support the lord caswallons enemies

  tros stroked his beard and pecked with
his sword-point at the floor-boards

  why did he write those lies he de-
manded

  but he knew why he knew she was tell-
ing the truth he knew caesars methods

  she recovered a trace of her former im-
pudence

  who am i to know caesars mind she
answered and tros recognized something
else that she was ready to betray any one
for her own advantage he clutched con-
ops arm and pulled him forward

  answer me in full or-

  caesar hoped that any of several things
might happen the lord caswallon might
kill you which would be payment for your
impertinence at seine-mouth or the lord
caswallon might mistrust you and put you
to flight when you might fall into caesars
hands and be crucified

  or learning of the lord caswallons
mistrust you might turn against him in self-
defense and joining his enemies start re-
bellion against him setting briton against
briton which would make invasion simpler
or you might be sensible and accepting
magnanimous forgiveness take command
of caesars fleet making use of your great
knowledge of the british coast to forward
an invasion

 or--

  tros knew there was something left un-
said he jabbed his sword into the floor
pulled back the hilt and let it go until it
hummed she understood him she must
speak before the humming ceased

  tros i am trained i sing and dance
some men -are easily tempted caesar

thought-

  continue what did caesar think

  i am not sure i know what he thought
then i will tell you caesar thought i
might be fool enough to accept his promise
from your ups i might be fool enough to
turn against caswallon might be fool
enough to captain caesars fleet a while fool
enough to come within his reach and serve
him until usefulness was spent and he could
pick another quarrel crucify me at his
leisure you were to beguile me and be-
tray me to him at the proper time

  lord tros i could not have done it i
could not betray a man like you i was
caesars slave now i am yours i would
rather be yours you are not wicked as
caesar is lord tros i will be your faithful
slave i wiu betray caesar to you only
no degradation i am not a common slave
i pity you tros answered pity shall
make no fool of me nor a successful rogue of
prisoners of war



  you answer my other question why
did caesar write in latin and not gaulish
he knew the lord caswallon knows no
latin

  ah but if the letter were in gaulish
the lord caswallon might have been sharp
enough to understand it was a trick to turn
him against you

  tros laughed in spite of weariness and
anger sheathing his sword

  who sups with caesar needs a long
spoon

  she tried to take advantage of his changed
mood gazing at him with dark lustrous eyes
that verged on tears

  lord tros you said you pity me do
pity me i was free-born romans de-
stroyed our city when i was a young child
i was sold and they took me to rome do
you know what that means to save my-
self from the worst that can befall a woman
i strove to become so valuable that for their
own sakes they would not throw me on the
market

  a dealer had bought me he had me
taught to dance and sing he began to make
use of me to entertain his customers and so
i learned intrigue

  once when caesar was in rome i was
sent to coax him to buy man-slaves i en-
tertained him and he bought at above the
market rate for such cattle as i offered
then thinking better of it he returned
those man-slaves to the dealer and kept me
at the price of three of them

  and since then he has used me for his
purposes bringing me to gaul because i
knew my mother-tongue lord tros like
master like slave i have had to be wicked
because caesar is lord tros i will serve
you as i never served caesar

  she glanced at helma smiled with such
meekness and such lustrous eyes that hel-
ma was stirred to sympathy and rose from
the bench though sigurdsens wife whis-
pered and restrained her

  she is yours too lord tros lei- me
serve her

  helma shuddered she had not expected
that she shook her head but tros was
in a quandary and given to strange master-
ful impulses when in that mood

  you have joined your destiny to mine
he said to helma you shall do your part
take charge of her keep her until cas-
wallon comes

  helma protested in a flutter of mistrust

she whispered to the other women then
seizing tros arm begged him to be more
cautious

  she will betray us all let britons
guard her

  but tros knew jealousy when he saw it
he laughed

  i have given you your task he
answered

  then at least a guard of northmen

  zeus he exploded but helma saw
the laughter in his eyes are northmen
deaf and you dumb if they are my
men shall they not obey you

   she dropped her eyes apologizing pleased

  so be it all save sigurdsen she an-
swered

  but when she looked up it was at con-
ops she knew well enough she could
manage sigurdsen

  heh what was that who disobeys
you deals with me tros answered

  he too suddenly faced conops

  you you see that woman helma
her name is she is my bride you obey
her save and except only when her orders
clash with mine

  conops blinked helma smiled at him

  oimoi we were master and man
now we are three and-take us con-
ops murmured

  for which impertinence tros took him by
the ear and cuffed him but not hard enough
to hurt

  over helma there crept a new visible
sense of possession nothing that tros
could have said or done could have made as
much impression as that speech she had
come into her own she was his mate his
partner

  strangers they might be with almost all
to learn about each other but tros had laid
a rock of confidence in place on which to
build the future and her eyes glowed
gratitude

chapter ix

tros strikes a bargain

tpros slept until caswallon came full
pelt with a yell to the guard at the
gate reining in foaming stallions with their
fore-feet over the porch and leaping along
the pole between them into the house
fflur following a moment later the chief
and orwic were conferring when tros rose
sleepily and bulked through the leather


adventure

curtains that divided inner-room from hall
caswallon eyed him swiftly searchingly
then smiled and strode to meet him

  brother tros he said embracing in the
british fashion one cheek then the other
each mans right hand patting the others
back

  caswallon was as swift of resolution and
as emotional as a boy beneath that rather
noncommittal surface his mustache hid
lips that gave the lie to the high cheek-
bones he was gentler than he seemed al-
though a mighty man in battle and stronger
than his two strongest men-at-arms

  he thrust the pawing dogs away pretend-
ing anger and took fflurs hand she watch-
ing tros as if she could read thoughts be-
fore he formed them three children came
and clung to fflur but she hardly noticed
them although they laughed at her be-
cause her hair was all blown from the chariot
ride and she was mud-bespattered from
caswallons trick of driving through and
over anything he met

  what is this about the gaulish woman
caswallon asked when he had waited for
tros to speak and tros said nothing

  she was csesars slave tros answered
she was not entitled to be anybodys guest
csesar insulted you me all of us every
briton of the trinobantes when he sent a
slave to intrigue among us as an equal

  so said caswallon and tugged his
mustache

  he glanced at fflur but she looked away
and gave him no counsel

  a slave eh do you know that

  troslaughed

  i will sell her to you if you wish she is
mine since caesar sent her to beguile me
i will write you a bill of sale for her and
sign it with caesars name and seal to
make it full and binding i will wear his
cloak that i took with his seal and treasure-
chest do you want her

  he was watching fflur sidewise consider-
ing the drama that her eyes revealed sud-
denly he caught her full gaze and she nod-
ded they understood each other

  if you are my friend tros said fflur
in her quiet voice you will keep that wo-
man from caswallon

  what is to be done with her asked
tros

  but instead of answering caswallon let
go fflurs hand and strode a dozen paces
up the hall and back again

  tros he said at last she was swift
she was swifter than death she came by
night in a chariot with a tale of shipwreck
and the friendship of the men of hythe
she said nothing of skell by morning
she had won half lunden she came to
visit me with more than thirty young
bloods fawning on her she showed me
caesars letter and she spoke of you

  in an hour nay in less than an hour
she had offered to betray both you and
caesar she gave me that letter and i
burned it it was latin and besides you
had been my friend i did not choose to
let my eyes see proof against you then-
we were alone then-she spoke to me of you
and fflur

  he believed it fflur interrupted
there was almost hatred in her eyes he
took that womans word that i the mother
of his sons was-

  fflur caswallon did his best to smile
but the ire in her gray eyes chilled him
you heard what the druid said did he
not say an evil woman can corrupt the
strongest man in a little while did the
druid not say i was no more to be blamed
than if i took a wound in battle have i
not begged your forgiveness until my tongue
stuttered against my teeth for lack of
words

  yes words fflur answered but
you turned that woman loose to make
worse mischief you let her go and live
with-

  should i have kept her in my house
caswallon almost yelled at her

  no said fflur

  should i have killed her what would
the druids have said to that what would
half britain have said that is forever urging
me to listen to caesars terms lud knows
its hard enough to rule without new ex-
cuses for dissension i had to say i would
take time for thought and before i could
think those northmen came plundering
the river-villages

  tros tried to pour oil on the waves of
argument

  the question is what shall be done with
her

  that which should have first been done
with her fflur answered send her
back to caesar with a whipping in a dress
turned inside out and a whip in her hand as
a gift to caesar bid her tell him that is
fflurs reply to rome
prisoners of war

i

  caswallon shrugged his shoulders hope-
lessly his blundering good-natured gen-
tlemanly sense of statecraft pulled him one
way his affection for his wife another

  fflur is forever positive he grumbled
taking tros by the shoulder but what
would you do half my kingdom favors
listening to caesar shall i ride it over
them

  tros threw his hands behind him legs
apart as if he stood deciding issues on his
own poop

  let us hear fflur what says fflur
he answered

 lud i have been hearing fflur

since-

  fflur interrupted she went to cas-
wallons side and held his hand then burst
into speech as if a ten-day dam were down
word galloping on word with sobs between
he is the best king britain ever had
bravest of them all generous-too just
to every one except himself they take
advantage kindness is weakness in a
king he should rule and he wont i
told him when to kill skell but he did not
even hunt him out of britain now skell
is back again they say caswallons friends

are hunting him orwic bade them-

  i thought of that said tros

  yes but it is your fault skell is living
tros-yours you should have killed him
when you had the chance what kind of
friend do you call yourself if you cant
slay caswallons enemies now orwic
says skell has escaped them do you know
what that means

  she paused for breath mastered a sob-
shaken voice and forced herself to speak
with the slow measured emphasis of
tragedy

  skell will go-has gone to black glend-
wyrs place glendwyr craves caswallons
shoes glendwyr leads the cowards who
would live by caesars leave skell will
urge glendwyr to revolt he will speak of
that gaulish woman he will lie about her
he will magnify her rank he will tempt
glendwyr to win caesars good will by be-
friending her and overthrowing you

  she almost struck her husband she was
so bent on compelling him to understand
his danger

  glendwyr will say you let the northmen
bum three villages he will say you sent
tros against caesar to irritate him when
you should have sought peace father of

my sons glendwyr will be in arms by to-
morrow with all the malcontents i know
it i know it

  pray lud he is caswallon answered
what have you done to be ready for
him fflur retorted glendwyr has been
brewing treason all these months did he
help us against caesar on the beach not
he he saved his men to use them against
you who helped this woman to reach
lunden with such speed skell whence
should skell get relays of swift horses i
tell you glendwyr did it

  how do you know that caswallon
asked frowning

  a druid said so

  lud rot the druids they carry tales

like kitchen-wenches

  the same druid told me that the wo-
man came to lunden in glendwyrs char-
iot fflur went on tight-lipped with anger
her eyes blazing

  why didnt you tell me that before

  i did you didnt listen you were in
love with her dark eyes you said no
woman should be refused a hearing and you
refused to hear me

  mother of my sons lud knows my ears
are full of your rebukes caswallon an-
swered comically sorry for himself peace
will you silence let us hear orwic
orwic looked bored and smiled wanly
as usual when there was reason to be deadly
serious stroking his mustache as if good
grooming were nine points of any problem

  theyve looted skells house i think
theyll burn it skell was gone though
and they cant find him fifty or sixty
others have gone too i daresay fflur is
right they may have followed skell to
glendwyrs place but that neednt spoil
the funeral glendwyr lives too far away
to interrupt that

  by lud he shall not interrupt it
caswallon exclaimed and fflur sighed as
if it were no use trying to make her husband
recognize danger

  she turned away and left them making
for the room where tros had installed hel-
ma and all his northmen with the woman
from gaul under their close surveillance

  there was presently much talk from be-
yond the wrinkled leather curtain while
caswallon tros and orwic stood face to
face considering what next to say to one
another they three stood in silence for a
long time


adventure

  suddenly helma came to them blink-
ing at the sunlight through the great door
her combed hair hung like spun-gold to
her waist lighter and fairer than gold
might be yet not so colorless as flax

  marriage or funeral first tros asked
by lud caswallon i would hate to see
you buried in my fathers grave yet if
i were skell-and if this glendwyr is the
man fflur thinks he is-there would be
more buryings tonight than the druids have
prepared for yet if you die they must
bury me too because i like to stand with
friends i would rather leave this girl a
widow than dowerless there is kings
blood in her veins

  he laid a hand on helmas shoulder

  my lord tros she said you are my
protector and you have done me greater
honor than befalls a many prisoners a
while ago i cried to my brother sigurdsen
to slay you on your own ship shall i
speak now or be silent

  speak said tros half-bowing to cas-
wallon for permission

  she of gaul-caesars woman helma
began and caswallon swore under his
breath he was sick of that subject but
fros pricked his ears

  she combed my hair swearing she would
serve me speaking presently of caesar
and of you most highly praising you by
inference contrasting you with caesar
so a little at a time she found out that i
know little concerning the lord caswallon
and that if i must choose i should follow
you refusing to acknowledge him there-
after for a long time she was silent while
she dressed my hair

  when she began to speak again she asked
about those of my people whom the lord cas-
wallon had made prisoners in the fighting in
the woods she knows they are now in a
great bam near the stables within the wall
that surrounds this house i think she over-
heard the command to bring them here

  she said she supposed i could influence
them and for a while after that she talked
of a dozen things-mainly of gaul and the
fate of caesars prisoners

  then when she had done my hair she
sat at my feet making a great show of humil-
ity and cried a little and then exclaimed
how much better destiny had treated me
than her me who am to be a great sea-
captains wife and she but a slave

  but after a while she held my hand

studying the lines across the palm saying
darkly i should feel the contrast if the noble
tros were slain before what i hoped should

happen

  so i questioned her pretending credence
in her art of reading what is written in
lines on the palm of the hand although i
know such stuff is witchcraft and a lie
invented to entrap fools presently hav-
ing made much talk of voyages and money
and-i think she said-five sons she grew
excited and very earnest saying there was
a grave disaster impending that i might
prevent if i were wise enough and she
said there was wisdom written on my palm
but too much overlaid with other lines that
signify a willingness to submit to whatever
fate may inflict

  she was very full of guile it was little
by little holding my hand and forever pre-
tending to read it that she hinted and then
spoke more plainly and then urged she
said it was written in my hand-mine-
that a revolt is coming and that you her
protector she called you would be slain
unless i bade the northmen seize you and
carry you to safety elsewhere

  i questioning she seemed to go into a
trance she stared at the wall her body
rigid and her breath in gasps she spoke
then of men who will revolt against the lord
caswallon intending to slay him and set
another in his place she said my destiny
and yours and hers lay with the new man
but she did not name him

  she spoke of tonights funeral she
said she could see me left in this house with
the northmen and a very small guard of
britons she said she could see me leading
away the northmen through the woods
guided by her and a briton toward men
who made ready to attack the lord caswal-
lon

  she said she saw the funeral and you
beside the lord caswallon men seized
you she said because she and i insisted
and they bore you off to safety in the woods
but the lord caswallon and the rest she
said they slew

  then she came out of the trance and
asked me what she had been saying she
said she never can remember afterwards
what passed her lips when those strange
spells possess her so i told her what she
had said and she seemed to grow afraid
asserting that a god had spoken through
her
prisoners of war



  then she urged me to be guided by the
voice of her trance saying she understood
now what it all meant how a certain lord
glendwyr who had lent her chariot and
horses to reach lunden would attack the
lord caswallon and himself become king

  she said let us plan so that all the
northmen in a band together shall seize the
lord tros and convey him to safety since
neither you nor he nor i nor the north-
men owe the lord caswallon anything but
the lord glendwyr will be glad to have us
with him 

  tros and caswallon met each others eyes

  how long have you known this north-
woman of yours caswallon asked

  we have all lived many lives and destiny
plays with us like pieces on the board
tros answered i know the truth when
i hear it

  he drew helma closer to him in the hol-
low of his left arm

  truth when a woman speaks cas-
wallon answered phaghi i grow sick
of these cross-purposes this is but a trick
again northmen are all liars this is a
plan to gather all the northmen in one
place they would gain my confidence
then break for liberty caesars woman
has had no time to learn glendwyrs plans
suppose he has any and who would trust
glendwyr against me not more men than
i can snap my fingers at

  he snapped his fingers then flexed his
muscles and threw his shoulders back

  give me one good excuse to burn
glendwyrs roost he exclaimed

  but tros grinned it was an aggravating
grin as he intended that it should be

  i have heard you say fflur is always
right  he answered caesars woman
has had five days caesar himself swifter
than the wind to snatch advantage doubt-
less picked her for her swiftness zeus
have you and i not seen how swift she is
and it may be that caesar knew before-
hand of glendwyrs plans

  caesar has spies and there are britons
who trade back and forth with gaul as
for instance the atrebates who are not your
friends caswallon why they tell me that
half of the atrebates live in gaul

  would it be wonderful if caesar should
have learned about dissension in your
realm romes very life is staked on other
folks dissensions so is caesars a dead
dog smells the same whichever way the

wind blows if he can keep rome by the
ears faction against faction for his own
advantage will he not do it here

   caswallon turned and paced
lojl-l the hall a time or two the blue-
a a veined skin of his face and neck
looking deathly white against the
hangings he chewed his mustache his
fingers worked behind his back as if he were
kneading the dough of indecision tros let
go of helma almost pushed lier from him

  cast up the reckoning he said let
us strike one woman off against the other
trusting neither but a third remains
how often have you told me fflur is al-
ways right i say take fflurs word for it
and look sharply to glendwyr

   caswallon stood still mid-length of the
hall

   it would suit me well to fight him he
said

   and he looked the part

  then fight him now tros answered
glendwyr thinks tonights obsequies will
hold you occupied is he mad enough to
spare you while your back is turned to
me itdooks simple enough

  caswallon came and stood in front of
him arms folded on his breast

  simple he said how long have you
known britain twenty years now i have
kinged it and i-i dont know my britons
yet

   if i should stand in your shoes i would
teach them to know me tros retorted
bahl it is as simple as a mutiny at sea
pick out the ringleader and smash him
thus then caesars woman fill her ears
let her learn by listening when she thinks
none watches her that you and every man
you trust will attend the obsequies tonight
leaving this town unguarded

   i will urge you in her hearing to guard
the town well you poohpooh it laughing
at me and bid orwic gather all your men
for the procession then help her to es-
cape or let fflur dismiss her in a fury let
fflur give her a chariot and send her to the
coast to make her own way back to caesar

   trust fflur to put sufficient sting in it to
make that plausible the woman will go
to glendwyr she will hurry to tell him
lunden is undefended good you post-
pone the obsequies you march you
catch glendwyr unready in the nervous
hour between preparation and the casting


adventure

of the dice you smite him in the night
hang him hang skell hang the gaulish
woman

  pack the three into a box and send it
with your compliments to caesar it will
smell good by the time it reaches him
then ride your bit of britain with a rough
hand drilling storing arrows making ready
for caesar will invade again caswallon as
surely as you and i and orwic stand here
clever but you dont know britain
caswallon answered i am a king but
the druids say their mysteries are more
than kingdoms even as a mans life is but a
spark in the night of eternity

  they have lighted the fires they have
informed the gods they have found the
right conjunction of the stars and set their
altars accordingly what the druids do
let no man interrupt

  lud rot the druids orwic muttered
but he was of a generation younger
that was more impatient with eternity

  how many men has glendwyr tros
asked

  maybe a hundred nor will he have
more unless he can score an advantage if
i have hard work raising a handful to fight
northmen what hope has he of raising an
army they might flock to him if he
should win a battle but not otherwise
and how many have you tros asked
maybe a hundred i raised three hun-
dred against the northmen but some were
killed some hurt and some have gone home
there will be a thousand in to-nights pro-
cession and as-many women but nine-tenths
would run

  britons are brave enough but they say
a king should king it they leave their
king to king it when the trouble starts
however glendwyr would never dare to
interrupt the druids

  have you not watched glendwyr
have you no spies tros asked

  yes but my men go home to the
feasting when a fight is over whether they
win or lose it glendwyrs men are feast-
ing too i will stake my kingdom on it

  i have seen kingdoms staked and lost
ere now said tros

  caswallons indifference puzzled him
he suspected the chief of knowing more
than he pretended and yet the almost
stupid bored look might be genuine
orwic looked as bored and careless as
caswallon did

  tros both hands behind him legs apart
considered how he might earn fair profit
that should leave him free of obligation to
the man who paid

  i have a bride a longship and a crew
of thirteen men i need more men he
remarked

  lud love me i can spare none said
caswallon

  you have three-and-twenty northmen
prisoners said tros and they once be-
longed to my man sigurdsen they are no
good to you for ransom they are seamen
they can build ships i can use them if
glendwyr should attack lunden while your

back is turned-

  caswallon smiled a little grimly but said
-nothing

  - they would naturally help glen-
dwyr if he turned them loose but i have
sigurdsen their former chief and i have
helma whom they love if i should prom-
ise them their freedom under me they
would fight at my bidding will you give
them to me if i guard you tonight while
your back is turned

  caswallon stared hard will you not
attend your fathers obsequies he asked

  that i would dearly love to do said
tros but you are my friend i think you
are in danger i would rather strike a hard
blow for a living man than shed tears fol-
lowing a dead one to the grave give me
the northmen

  what will you do with them caswal-
lon asked

  i will guard your back tonight

  you mean you will dare to hold lun-
den town for me with six-and-thirty men
caswallon asked

  he hid his mouth behind his hand as
he watched tros eyes and once for about
a second he glanced at orwic

  aye tros answered i am no fair-
weather friend as for my father if he
could come from the dead he would bid me
attend to the task of living and leave com-
fortably dead men to the druids

  you are mad tros said caswallon
but i like you though i did doubt you a
while back you are a fool northmen are
poor laborers on land i will give you in-
stead as much land as you can stride the
length of on your own feet from dawn to
sunset with caesars gold you can buy
mares and cattle i will give you the gray
stallion i bought a month ago from the
prisoners of war



iceni helma to wife and a holding in
britain what more do you want

  freedom a ship and the sea tros
answered nay no bondage to the dirt
will you give me the northmen

  they are yours caswallon answered
but you are more mad than a hare in the
furrows in spring

  nevertheless he nodded at orwic as if
tros bargain suited him and orwic smiled
behind a hand that stroked his long mus-
tache

chapter x

rash wise desperate or all three

 i here was a deal of talk still inter-
rupted by men who came in to ask
about the nights procession and by the
servants who set up the long table in the
hall putting benches in place and silver
plates for folk of high degree wooden ones
for ordinary mortals britains never moved
whether for war or peace until they had
gorged enormously

  a poor enough wedding feast cas-
wallon said i would rather you waited

tros until-

  tros interrupted him with one of his
deep-sea laughs that rose from somewhere
near his middle where the sword hung

  until glendwyr runs me through and
you give helma to a man who loves horses
and pigs nay caswallon you shall marry
me this day then if i die helma will be
dowered with money and ship so she may
choose and not be chosen

  he swaggered with his deep-sea captains
gait toward the long room at the rear where
all his northmen lay glooming their eyes
on caesars woman who sat between si-
gurdsens wife and the widow

  sigurdsen rose to his feet as tros entered
he looked as if recovering from too much
mead his eyes were red his knees shook a
northern gloom possessed him such as grays
a winters sea but he met tros eyes as faith
to faith without emotion

  he would have spoken but tros checked
him with one of those gestures of confidence
that convey more than a hundred words
sigurdsen sat down again among his men
his back toward a leather-curtained wall

  tros smiled at caesars woman she
smiled back remaining seated she did
not glance at helma who had followed tros
into the room but she let tros see that she

understood helma had told of the palm-
reading and the trance her liquid eyes
were more intelligent than lovely-too alert
too knowing

  tros out-acted her over his bold face
there swept such visible emotions as a man
might feel who found himself mistaken who
had doubted to discover that his doubt was
wrong who envied brains more subtle than
his own who held the upper hand yet felt a
diffidence in using it because he must seek
favors of his victim

  there was vague regret depicted and a
little laughter at the ebb and flow of destiny
a gift of guile that could admire guile the
expression of a clever gambler losing who
will pay the bet

   if you stay fflur will tear you to pieces
he said grinning stroking his chin letting
the black beard straggle through his fingers
i am your slave she answered

  she laid chin on hands both elbows on her
knees to watch his face

  he nodded

  careless kings are weak friends he said
darkly caswallon cares nothing about
you fflur will not endure you you may
go i will send you to glendwyrs place
tell glendwyr i would have come with you
but i attend my fathers obsequies say if
he takes lunden before dawn i will be-
friend him with six-and-thirty northmen
noble tros she answered i will tell
glendwyr how many men guard lunden if
you inform me

  none said tros almost whispering
she stared he nodded one arm across
his chest resting the other elbow on it
chin on hand

  tell glendwyr i arranged that i pay
for service rendered handsomely you un-
derstand me

  noble tros i am your slave you shall
be king of britain and caesars friend if
you will trust me

  i judge words by performances tros
answered come

  he led her to the stable-yard where orwic
had a chariot for her yoked and waiting

  how far to glendwyrs place he asked
her as if that were an afterthought

  four or five hours she answered but
glendwyr waits only three hours ride away
or it may be less i know the place his
charioteer who brought me showed me
where the road turns off by a stream in the
forest


adventure

  go fast said tros bid glendwyr
hasten say if he fails this night i will
never again trust him and you likewise
fail me and you will find caesar a more
forgiving man than me serve me and i
am more generous than caesar

  orwic opened a side gate standing behind
it so that she did not catch sight of him
although her appraising eyes swept every
corner of the yard and tros was sure she
knew the count of chariots that stood pole-
upward the number of restless horses in the
long sheds and how many serfs played
knuckle-bones under the eaves

  those eyes of hers missed nothing except
that tros laughed when her chariot went
plunging through the gate and that it was
orwic caswallons nephew and his right-
hand-man who slammed the gate shut be-
hind her

  a mares nest said orwic rather mel-
ancholy there will be no eggs in it
i know glendwyr bold when it pays to lie
low coward at smiting time if he had
come to fight the northmen yes he might
have won a following against caswallon
afterward

  but he lay low then and he will lie low
now until caswallon has an army at his
back then the fool will have at us-lud
help him he shall lie low then for all
time

  tros amber eyes glanced at the sky

  northeast wind backing to the north
he answered but what he meant by that he
did not say any more than he knew what
orwics air of information in reserve might
mean

 he returned to where helma waited
whispering to sigurdsen the northman
looked at tros with new appraisal in his
eyes and actually smiled at last

  can he fight tros asked is he fit
for an adventure

  sigurdsen nodded and talked back to
helma in a singsong growl that sounded
like the sea on jasper beaches but tros did
not wait for all that outburst to be inter-
preted when helma turned to speak he
took her by the shoulders and in short
hurried phrases told her of the plan in mind

  so she told sigurdsen and he laughing
told the others bidding one of them help
him strip off all the bandages that impeded
his arms and his huge shoulder-muscles

  tros led the way then toward the yard
but conops met him in the door gesturing

secrecy mysterious as if he came from
snooping in a graveyard

  master one word

  aye and i will count the word be

swift

  conops drew him back into the room and

whispered

  master women are no good i know
i never dallied with a woman but she robbed
me that one you have sent away would
sell her lover to a press-gang for the price of
a drop of scent this one this yellow-
haired young one will scold you day in day
out when she is older she will be like
fflur who scolds caswallon until he darent
even drink without her leave and drinks
because she worries him master dont
marry her dont dont and your
father not yet in his grave

  tros took him by the neck laughed
shook him until his teeth clattered like

  stand by he said stand by you
hear me stand by for dirty weather if
you smell the wind if she should scold
me i will take it out on your hide little
man you little one-eyed split-lipped red-
haired freckled dissolute ugly faithful
friend o mine b elay advice

  out oars you knife-nasty wharf-run-
ning loyal old dirty-weather sea-dog stow
that tongue and stand by me as i endure
you dock-rat drunkard shame of the
levant impertinent devoted trusty that
you are no back-talk or ill break your
head ill buy a wife for you and make
you keep her now are you satisfied

tros banged his head against
the wall by way of clinching argu-
ment and strode at the head of
his northmen to the stable-yard
they tramping in his wake like henchmen
who had served him since the day they car-
ried arms with conops fussing along behind
them ragging sigurdsen because he did not
keep step

  but sigurdsen was too proud to fall into
the rhythm of the tramp and rather too
long-legged also he was not at all disposed
to do what conops told him or even to take
notice of him or to admit that he under-
stood

  when they reached the great barn where
caswallons northmen were confined or-
wic was waiting and unlocked the compli-
cated wooden contrivance that held the
prisoners of war



beam in place across the double door there
was no armed guard the prisoners knew
they were safer there than if at liberty until
the rage against them should die and bri-
tons resume their usual easy-going tolerance
of friend and former foe alike they were
lying in straw their wounded wrapped in
clean white linen

  those who could rise were on their feet the
moment sigurdsen stood bulked against the
light there were only two who lay still al-
though a dozen of them had to struggle from
the straw being stiff from painful wounds

  but there was none hurt beyond fairly
swift recovery or he would have been
finished where he lay on the battlefield as
unfit for slavery half-slavery of service to a
british chief or ransom

  tros with helma next to him stood one
side of the long barn where the failing sun-
light pouring through the door shone on
their faces sigurdsen his northmen at
his back stood facing tros and there began
such rhetoric as tros had never heard

  for sigurdsens fever had left him and
left his brain clear a beaten chief hope-
less of ransom tros had given him far bet-
ter terms than even over-generous caswal-
lon would have dared to give

  the britons would have put him to hard
labor for a year or two a dismal execution
overhanging him if he should fail to please
thereafter little by little they might have
let him rise from serfdom to a holding of his
own half-subject to one of the numerous
minor chiefs

  but tros had offered him a free mans
post of honor second-in-command to tros
himself and great adventure on the un-
known seas

  so sigurdsen waxed eloquent therhythm
of the northern sagas rang among the barn-
beams as his throat rolled out in norse a
challenge to defeated men to rally to a new
prince tros of samothrace sea-captain with-
out equal loved of thor and odin brave and
cunning tros who stood before them tros
who had claimed the fair-haired helma
daughter of a hundred kings to be his bride

  there seemed no stopping him now that
he had broken his long silence he recited
helmas pedigree commencing in the dim
gray dawn of time with mythical half-
deities and battles between gods and men
he made the roof-beams ring to the names
of heroes and fair-haired heroines whose
record seemed to consist exclusively of

battlefield betrothals glittering wedding
feasts and death on fields of honor

  he chanted of a golden age when his
ancestors were kings it seemed of half a
universe with wisemen to support them and
defeat the magic of the witches and trolls
who counseled enemies whose only purpose
in existence was apparently to act as nine-
pins for heroes to knock down

  and presently he sang of tros his
measured rhythmic prose grew into sing-
song as imagination seized him until almost
one could hear the harp-strings picking out
the tune hs had no facts to hamper him
except the all-important one that tros had
conquered him in single fight and recogniz-
ing a descendant from the gods had pledged
with him faith forever on an oaken poop
a sea-swept poop a poop of a proud ship
mistress of the gales a strong ship a long-
ship a ship that tros a mighty man in
battle saw and seized-he single-handed
slaying fifty men

  he made a pedigree for tros he chanted
of his black beard and his amber eyes that
were the gift of odin treasured through end-
less centuries by high-born women who
were born into the world to mate with off-
spring of a hundred gods he sang of seas
that roared in cataracts across the far rim
of the world where tros had met strange
fleets and smitten them to ruin and the
bare bones of the foemen strew the beaches
and the rotting timbers of the wrecks lie
broken on the sand

  he crowded half a century of fighting
into tros short life described his father as
a king of kings who died in battle against
fifty thousand men and ended with a
prophecy that tros would found a kingdom
in which kings and queens should be his
vassals dukes and earls his serving men
and amber the stuff his cups are made of
platters of gold to eat from

  a hundred sons and grandsons men of
valor should comb the earth in rivalry of
manhood to deserve the privilege of wear-
ing tros sword when ripe in years and
splendor he should go at last to where the
gods and all his ancestors make merry amid
feasting in valhalla

  tros did not understand a word of it
but helma told him as much as she could
remember of it afterward when they had all
done roaring hail to him and the chari-
oteers and stable-men crowded in the door-
way-first with a notion that trouble was


adventure

brewing and then because orwic appeared
well pleased adding their own shouts to the
tumult

  all the northmen kissed helma and did
fealty to tros each touching the hilt of his
jong sword and murmuring hoarse words
that sounded like an echo of a longship
launching off the ways there was a roll
of thunder in it and the names of thor and
odin

         helma smiled through tears a
         eam grandeur on her face

              se was seus when she re-
peated to tros what sigurdsen
had sung she walking hand-in-hand with
him toward caswallons hall with the
northmen tramping in the rear supporting
the wounded between them

  it did not appear to occur to her that
there might be any untruth in tros pedi-
gree as sigurdsen unfolded it or that there
might be anything far-fetched in the ac-
count of tros wanderings and battles at the
far rim of the world that he was not so
old as sigurdsen and could not possibly have
done a hundredth part of all that sigurdsen
ascribed to him meant nothing to her

  she was proud of her new lord beyond the
limit of expression far beyond the common-
place dimensions of such tawdry facts as
time and space she walked beside him
worshiping her young strong virgin heart
aglow with such emotion as no years can
limit

  lord tros she said her voice thrilled
there was vision in her eyes my brother
saw beyond the veil of things the gods
sang through his mouth it is honor and
joy to me beyond words that i will bear
your sons

  whereat tros went searching in his mind
for words such as he had never used to man
or woman marveling how lame a thing is
language and how a tongue not given to
too much silence can so hesitate between
one sentence and another falling between
both into a stammering confusion so that
he felt ashamed

  whether i be this or that and a strong
man or a weak one i will do that which is in
me so that you be not sorry if my best may
make you glad he said at last

  and he took comfort from the speech al-
though it irked him to be picking and choos-
ing yet to find no proper words and he
did not think of his father at all although he

was conscious that he did not think of him-
which would have puzzled him still more if
he had pondered it

  the sun went down and servants lighted
the oil-fed wicks in long bronze sconces on
the wall when they all came to caswallons
table and the noisy men-at-arms filed in-
caswallons relatives by blood or marriage
most of them-heaping their arms in the
racks in the vestibule and quarreling among
themselves for right of place at table

  some of them had wives who sat each be-
side her husband because ffiur was at
table beside caswallons great gilded
throne-chair that had been pulled forward
from under the balcony unmarried wo-
men served the food receiving it from serfs
at the kitchen door

  tros sat next to fflur with helma on his
right beyond her sigurdsen his wife and
all the northmen faced curiously aimiable
britons who seemed to think it a good joke
to be eating and drinking on equal terms
with men whom they had beaten in battle
recently conops stood behind tros se-
lecting the best dishes as they came and
snatching them to set before his master

  first came the mead in beakers that the
women carried in both hands caswallon
struck the table with his fist for silence
then beaker in hand stood up and made the
shortest wedding-speech that tros-and
surely britain-had ever heard

  men of lunden we go presently to
where the druids speed brave comrades
through the darkness men call death into a
life that lies beyond and none knows
what the morrow shall bring forth so there
are acts that should be done now lest death
first fall on us like rain that shuts off a
horizon hear ye all this is my brother
tros to him i give this woman helma to
be wife and all these northmen who were
mine by victory to be his faithful men-at-
arms and servants tros

  he raised his beaker and drank deep
up-ending it in proof there were no dregs
and when that swift ceremony was complete
they all drank except tros and helma then
cheered until the great hall crashed with
sound fflur rising gave a golden flagon
into tros hands from which he and helma
drank in turn tros finishing the mead with
one huge draught that left him gasping
when he set the flagon bottom-up then
he spoke and was briefer than caswallon

  lord caswallon you have named me
prisoners of war



brother i abide that name at your
hands i accept this woman she is my wife
i accept these men they shall obey me
and whatever destiny may bring they shall
at least say they have followed one who
stood beside his friends in need and kept
faith whatsoever came of it

   then tros took the broad gold band that
he had replaced on his forehead and by
sheer strength broke it signifying that a
chapter of his life was ended

   he began the next by binding the broad
gold around his brides right arm she staring
at the symbols carved on it and wondering
what gods they charged with her protection

i but there were some who murmured it
was witchcraft and a married woman cried
aloud that the breaking of the golden circle
was an omen of ill-luck

   thereafter tros had hard work to prevent
 his northmen from drinking themselves
 useless since the mead flowed without limit
 and as host caswallon was too proud to
 check them

   but tros imposed restraint by promising
the widow-woman to the soberest whereat
conops in a panic began drinking behind
tros back

   and when the hurried feast was nearly
at an end there came a bare-back galloper
mud-spattered sweating who burst into
the -hall and ran to caswallons chair
thrusting his head and shoulders between
the chief and fflur he whispered but
tros heard him

  lord make ready to hold lunden
glendwyr and two hundred men are
marching they are at the kings stone
by the thames they mean to make
glendwyr chief while you stand on a hill-
side communing with dead mens souls
all lunden is empty not a light no
guard at lud-gate they have all gone to
the druids circle

   aye why not caswallon answered
   but he glanced at tros

  lord stay and fight glendwyr he
will burn your house

   not he caswallon laughed lud rot
him he would like too well to live in it
two hundred men you say did you
count them

  nay i rode but i heard two hun-
dred

   caswallon laughed again

    kingston-on-thames the old stone in the market-
 place is nowadays said to be of saxon origin but there is no
 proof it is not druidic and its true early history is obscure

  maybe he rides like us to the burying

  but he glanced at tros

  lord caswallon i have warned you i
have done my part

  nay not yet the whole of it caswallon
answered

  and he looked a third time straight into
tros eyes while he wiped his mustache
with a freckled blue-veined hand

  take a fresh horse ride and find
glendwyr bid him meet me at the hill-
side where the druids wait say-there-
when the souls of the dead have traveled
their appointed path and all the fires die i
will fight him he and i alone it will be
dawn before the fires die say i will fight
him for my house and lunden when dawn
rises over the druids hill

  he will not believe me

  show him this caswallon answered
and he pulled a great gold bracelet off his
wrist

  but fflur shook her head and sighed as if
words failed her

  the man would have gone at once to ride
his errand but tros who had been whisper-
ing to fflur leaned behind her and caught
the fellows arm

  let him wait let him see us all go
he whispered wrenching at the mans arm
so that he swore aloud and struggled not
hearing what was said let him first see
me and my men march out with the rest

  caswallon nodded

  wait he ordered ride when i tell
a 

so the man went and sat by
the fireside drinking mead and
rubbing a wrist that tros had
come near breaking

  caswallon will you hear me fflur
asked

  nay for you are always right he
laughed and i know what you will say
fflur that the druids rule britain which is
true enough but you will tell me i should
ride it rough over the druids which i dare
not right though it may be you are a
druids neck may break like any other
mans and i could butcher a herd of them
maybe like winters beef but can i convince
britons i am right to do it

  how long would they be about raising a
new king to rule in place of me the druids
would choose that king and be stronger
than ever the druids summoned you me
o

adventure

and all lunden to the burying tonight
obey them

  nay i am the king but i go never-
theless and so do you go and all my men
and all lunden town because a kings
throne has four legs of which the first is a
druid and the second is ceremony and the
third is mystery and the fourth is common
sense but the druids did not summon tros
nor any of his new men

  he looked hard at tros again

  they left that courtesy to me to under-
take and it maybe i forgot to mention it
he did not wait for fflur to answer he
rose gesturing toward the door through
which the sound of stamping stallions came
and the crunch of bronze wheels on the
gravel drive

  now tros he said i would not leave
you here unless i knew this glendwyr busi-
ness is a little matter and i know too
that you need a hook on which to hang
your coat as it were if you are to winter
here in britain i need a good excuse to
lend you house and countenance in spite of
jealousy and tales against you

  so-glendwyr is no great danger but he
will serve your end if he has fifty men
that is more than i think and the half of
those will run when the first one yells as a
spear-point pricks him at luds gate
glendwyr counts on lunden turning against
me if he can steal my house take care
then that he never enters it for my part i
will let the men of lunden know you saved
their town for them tonight when their
backs were turned

  tros answered him never a word

  is he a rash fool or so wise that he can
laugh at rash fools or a desperate king with
druids on his neck or all three things at
once he wondered

  but caswallon marched out looking like
a man who understood all the rules of the
game of kinging it

chapter xi

the battle at luds gate

tros gathered his northmen the
wounded and all for they could eat
and drink and walk whatever else might
ail them and with helma at his side
brought up the rear of the procession be-
hind fifty chariots that swayed in the crim-
son glare of torches held by men on foot

  far away to the north-westward beyond
the forest and the marsh there was a crim-
son glow against the sky where druids
fires burned and all the distance in between
was dotted with the irregular glow of torches
where the folk of lunden and the neighbor-
ing villages formed one continuous stream

  zeus those druids have the britons
by neck and nose tros muttered would
my father have asked burial at the risk of
a mans throne not he he would have
ordered them to throw his body on a dung-
heap and defend themselves if he is not
too busy in another world he will forgive
me for not attending his funeral

  the long procession filed through the
circle of solemn yew-trees where the altar
was on which a daily sunrise sacrifice was
laid and there tros halted gathering his
men around him bidding helma explain his
plan to sigurdsen

  now we march back one has ridden
to warn caswallons enemies that his house
is empty and the town unguarded he saw
us all march away and though that man is
caswallons friend the information will leak
out of him like the smell of strong wine
through a bottle-neck there is none in
lunden save the fire-guard a few old wo-
men and it may be a handful of drunken
fishermen down by the riverside

  who is the fire-guard sigurdsen asked
for he knew next to nothing of britons ex-
cept that they were not fit to be reckoned
with at sea although great fighters on horse-
back and on foot in their forests

  they said tros are about a score of
old men who sleep by day and are supposed
to patrol by night this night instead of
snoring in the watch-house they shall serve
a purpose conops go find the fire-
guard wake them keep them awake
see that each cripple of them arms himself
with two good torches hide them within
caswallons wall with a small fire handy
at which to light the torches swiftly when
i blow three blasts somewhere near the
town-gate

  when i do that make all the noise pos-
sible and run downhill toward the gate as
if at least fifty of you were coming to my
aid if the running kills them they will die
in a good cause so spare none no talk
now go about your business hurry
how much of a fight is this to be
asked sigurdsen a third of us are stiff
with wounds
prisoners of war

l

  he flexed his own great muscles but it
hurt him

  neither more nor less than any fight
tros answered tell him helma that a
man does what he can do and neither gods
nor men should ask more or expect less

  he saw that nothing could be gained by
telling sigurdsen how great the danger was
the northmen had too recently been beaten
to thrill at any thought of a folorn hope
he must make them think their task was
easy so he led off whistling to himself

  and first he returned to caswallons
house to rifle the great racks of arms that
lined a storeroom near the hall there was
no guard no lock he laughed as he served
out bows and arrows laughed again as he
thought of that gold he had won from
caesar

  fflur was supposed to be guarding it
it was probably under her bed he won-
dered where caswallons own treasure lay
all the golden money coined in the mint at
verulam

  honesty unless all other men are honest
is no better than achilles heel he re-
flected britons are madman caswallon
is the maddest of them all

  he marched his men out through cas-
wallons gate slowly because some limped
and had to lean on others and downhill
between the neat fenced houses leaving
sigurdsens wife and the widow-woman
with orders to attach themselves to conops
torch-brigade but helma he kept with
him since he had no other means of in-
structing his men

  they marched into a creeping gray mist
ascending from the river that made trees
and houses loom like ghost-things from an-
other world

  except that once or twice a tied hound
bayed at them and cows lowed in the barns
as they went by there was no sign of life
until they reached luds gate with the
wooden bridge beyond it

  there was a guardhouse built of mud and
timber either side the gate but no lights
and only one man fast asleep on a bench
within an open guardhouse door when
tros wakened him he said he was there to
entertain belated strangers and he pulled
out a bag of roasted wheat supposing that
tros and his men wished food and lodging
for the night

  he was a very old man trembling with

   nowadajs known as st albans

the river-ague but tros pressed him into
service since he admitted that he knew
every nook and corner of the sparsely
wooded land that lay beyond the bridge

  tros decided not to close the town gate
it was ajar when he arrived because the old
man was too thoughtful of his ague to wish
to struggle with it if a stranger should seek
admittance tros flung it wide and lighted
the bronze lamps in both guardhouse win-
dows so that any one coming would know
there was no obstruction and might elect
to ride full-pelt across the bridge

  the wall reached either way into obscu-
rity it was a thing of mud and lumber
useless against battery but too high for an
enemy to waste time climbing if he should
see a gap that he might gallop through
beyond were occasional clumps of trees
that loomed through the drifting mist a
low gurgle from the swamps at the river-
edge and silence

  now said tros to helma you shall
be a widow on your bridal night or else
shall wife it with a man who stands firm in
one kings favor it seems to me the britons
are all fools not alone caswallon so i
think this man who comes to seize cas-
wallons throne is no whit wiser than the
rest if i am wrong then you are as good
as married to a dead man but we shall
see

  he took helma and the old guardhouse
man across the bridge with him ignored a
clump of trees and undergrowth-since any
fool might look for an ambush there-and
after ten minutes stumbling over tufted
ridge and muddy hollow chose a short
stretch of open country where the road
crossed what apparently was level ground

  but he noticed it was not actually level
mist and darkness were deceptive fifty
feet away to one side the smooth grazed
turf was half a mans height higher than the
road and from that point it fell away again
into a mist-filled hollow he could have
hidden a hundred men there

  he glanced at the town gate wide in-
viting lamplight shone across the open-
ing blurred by fog and he whistled con-
tentedly as he realized what a glare conops
torches would make seen from that view-
point through the lighter mist uphill but
there was something lacking yet

  if they come they will come in a hurry
they will charge the open gate they will
get by before we can check them


adventure

  he observed again on his left hand
almost exactly midway between his chosen
ambush and the town-gate was the clump
of trees and undergrowth that looked like
such a perfect lurking place

  helma he said pointing to it take
this old skinful of ague and hide yonder in
the trees i will give you the three worst-
wounded men as well and there is flint and
tinder in the guardhouse mark this place
in your mind when the enemy comes
abreast of me-for i will hide here along
with sigurdsen and all the others-you
strike flint on steel and make a good noise
in the bushes if that does not check them
light a torch or two

  i would liefer die beside you helma
answered

  you will do my bidding tros retorted
and she said no word to that

so tros went for his northmen
putting the three most badly
wounded along with the old gate-
house-keeper in helmas charge
and them he hid carefully in the clump
of trees showing them precisely between
which branches to make their sparks and
how to thrash the undergrowth but as to
the proper time to do that he trusted
helma

  wife or widow he said throwing an
arm around her laughing gruffly for he had
a long road yet to travel before he would
trust the gentler side of him do your
part and i will do mine so the gods will
do theirs for they like to see men and
women prove themselves

  with that he left her to her own devices
and tramped away with sigurdsen the
other northmen following and presently
he hid them all on the shoulder of the slope
above the road where even if mounted men
should spy them from the higher level of
horse or chariot their heads would look like
tree-stumps in the mist he was careful to
space them at unequal intervals not in a
straight line

  but the northmen were nervous they
had drunk too much and had been told too
little nor had they any interest in fighting
except that they would rather for their own
sakes please tros than offend him it was
hard to keep them quiet although sigurd-
sen went down the line whispering hoarsely
rebuking even striking them they com-
plained of their wounds and the chill night

air repeatedly crowding together for
warmth protesting that the turf was damp
yet neglecting to keep their bow-strings dry

  then a stallion neighed not far away
another answered which sent the shivers up
tros spine orwic had told him which way
glendwyr must come if he should come at
all but those stallions were somewhere be-
hind him whereas the road spread in front
to left and right until it turned away through
distant trees and followed the riverbank

  his next trouble was that the northmen
even sigurdsen grew sleepy some of them
snored and he had to throw stones at them
all of them were half-asleep when he caught
the sound of horsemen in the distance and
it was the sound of so many horses that he
feared for one long minute his chilled in-
different men would welcome panic and
take to their heels

  but sigurdsen sensed the panic and
stood up swearing he would die beside
tros tros had to force him down again
before the advance-guard of what seemed
to be at least a hundred horsemen began
looming through the mist then to the
rear again three horses neighed but it
sounded strangely as if the neighing
were half-finished smothered some of
the advancing horses answered it but
there was no reply

  zeus we are in for it tros muttered to
himself a hundred coming-more an-
other lot behind us waiting to join them
no quarter horsemen front and rear
well theres a laugh in everything my
northmen have nowhere to run zeus
what a mad fool must caswallon be to
leave me and this handful to defend all
lunden

  he took a long chance crept along the
line to see that bow-strings were all taut
shaking each man as he passed growling
orders that accomplished more because the
northmen could not understand a word he
said if they had understood him they
might have tried to argue

  the leading horsemen riding slowly
peering to left and right drew nearly abreast
of the ambush one of them turned and
shouted at least a hundred in the mist
along the road began cantering to catch up

  helma heard that her sparks flashed
and there began a crashing in the under-
brush just as the advance-guard began to
spur their horses to a gallop they saw
heard drew rein again began shouting to
prisoners of war



the men behind and in a moment there was
a milling mass of men and horses those
ahead pressing back into an impatient
orderless squadron that came plunging into
them a mdlee of ghosts in the mist
somewhere away behind tros stallions
neighed again

  shouts yells imprecations argument
and into that tros loosed his northmens
arrow-fire he could hear the clatter of
bronze wheels and the thunder of hoofs be-
hind him now he knew he was between
two forces one careering from behind him
to make junction with the other he blew
three bugle-blasts that split the night and
watched for conops torches heard an an-
swering bugle-blast and saw them come
pouring through caswallons gate a splurge
of angry crimson whirling and spreading
in the mist

  shoot shoot shoot into the mass

  he seized a bow and arrows from a man
who did not understand him and launched
shaft after screaming shaft into the riot
where fallen horses kicked and men cursed
none sure yet whence the arrows came and
each men yelling contrary advice as some
fell stricken and some saw the torches com-
ing downhill

  tros men were on their knees to take
advantage of the shoulder of the rise from
in front they were hardly visible but
sigurdsen saw the havoc they had vrought
already heard the thunder of hoofs and
wheels approaching from behind sensed
climax and rose to his full height roaring
no more bow for him he dropped the
thing and stood in full view whirling his
ax bull-bellowing his men to charge and die
down there at handgrips with the britons

  the northmen rallied to him in a cluster
on the ridge no more bows and arrows
if they had to die they drew swords and
axes

  tros since he had lost control of them
took stand by sigurdsen and sent one final
shaft death-whining into the mob before
trying to face his party both ways the
chariots were almost on them from behind
din of hoofs and wheels no shouting din
deadened by the turf

  three-score men in the road had rallied
somehow saw northmens heads against
the skyline spurred their panicky horses
and wheeled to charge uphill but even
as they wheeled a squadron of chariots
hub-to-hub came thundering through the

night on tros right-hand and crashed into
the riot in the road a wave of horsemen fol-
lowing and then another before sigurdsen
could lead his men ax-swinging into that
confusion where they could never have dis-
tinguished friend from foe the half of
glendwyrs men were in headlong flight
hard followed it was over in sixty seconds

  tros beat his northmen back with the
flat of his swordblade until helma came
breathless and clinging to sigurdsen
screamed at them all to let the britons fight
among themselves but nobody quite
understood what had happened until cas-
wallon loomed out of the mist drawing
rein resting one foot on the wooden rim
above the chariots wicker-work

  brother tros he said did you think
i would leave you in the dark to guard my
back by lud no kinging it means
trusting enemies to do their worst and
watching friends lest they suffer by being
friends i told you this would be a little
matter but it was no small thing for you
to prove you are my friend and nbt caesars

 you came between block and knife
said tros his foot on the hub of the wheel

  not i didnt you hear my stallions
squeal before we silenced them have you
seen glendwyr

 the chariot-horses reared and
shied and tros had to jump clear
of the wheel before he could an-
swer for conops came rushing up
torch in hand and all the kings horses or
all the kings men meant nothing to him
until he knew tros was safe

  but when he had thrust the torch close
to tros face and made sure there were no
wounds he thought of loot and vanished in
the direction where the loot might be there
was a glare of torchlight in the town gate
where his breathless veterans stood hesi-
tating doubtful ready to welcome which-
ever side was victor

  then a shout out of the darkness orwics
voice-

  we have the young glendwyr

  orwics chariot crowded with five or six
men drew up beside caswallons three
men were holding one he struggled but
he ceased to struggle when they dragged
him from the chariot and stood him close
to tros beside caswallons wheel in a
minute the whole party was surrounded by
dismounted horsemen whose held horses


adventure

kicked and bit while their owners clamored
for young glendwyrs death

  but caswallon waited tugging his mus-
tache until the clamor died it was not until
men hardly breathed and they had some-
how quieted the horses that he spoke to the
prisoner suddenly and when he did speak
his voice had a hammer-on-anvil note

  you hear what these say where is your
father

  dead

  the youngsters voice was insolent
hoarse with anger he was possibly eight-
een but it was not easy to see his face
because the mist came drifting like smoke
on a faint wind and the torchlight cast
fantastic shadows distorting everything

  he had black hair that fell on to stalwart
shoulders and he stood straight with his
chin high although two men held his arms
behind him and were at no pains to do it
gently

  how did he die when caswallon
asked

  the youngster answered scornfully as if
caswallon not he were the accused

  luds mud you are the one who should
ask that you who sent caesars woman
to him you who sent a lying messenger to
challenge him after her dagger had done its
work

  lud knows i would have fought him
caswallon answered pleasantly enough

  you you lie you sent word to him
to meet you at the druids hill and a wo-
man to make sure he should never reach
there

  like father like son caswallon an-
swered if your father is dead why didnt
you ride to fight me in his place instead
of sneaking through the dark to loot my
lunden town i have caught you in your
fathers shoes but how did he die

  i say she stabbed him

  caswallon made a hissing sound between
his teeth

  where is she now he demanded and
the youngster chose to misinterpret the flat
note of dissatisfaction in his voice

  aye he sneered back she has earned
fflurs place but you will have to win her
first from skell luds mud if there is any
manhood in you fight me before skell
comes with a dagger for your back

  boy i would have fought your father
gladly or you in his place caswallon an-
swered i am vexed not to have slain him

but as for you now you will do well to
bridle impudence you are not free so you
have no right to challenge any one

  luds blood the youngster swore i
came to burn your house ill ask no
mercy

  he spat and a briton close beside him
would have struck him in the face but
caswallon prevented that

  let him be he has fire in his brain
boy i will not kill you nor shall any wo-
man kill you while you are at my charge
will you lie in fetters until some foreign
ship puts in needing rowers or shall i give
you to my friend tros

  the youngster nearly wrenched his two
guards off their feet as he turned to glare
at tros whose amber eyes met his and
laughed at him

  be still boy tros advised him if
i say no to this you will die of scurvy on
some phenicians deck or else be sold to be
chained to an egyptian oar

  the youngster bit a word in two and
swallowed half of it he did not like to be
laughed at but it had only just begun to
dawn on him that he was lawfully cas-
wallons property a prisoner caught in the
act of rebellion henceforth with no more
rights than if he had been born a slave not
even the right to be hanged or burned alive

  how many prisoners are taken cas-
wallon asked in a loud voice and there was
some calling to and fro through the mist
before orwic answered-

  nine-and-thirty also a dozen or four-
teen who are hurt so they will not live
brother tros how many will you need
to build and man this ship your heart de-
sires caswallon asked

  ten score at the least tros answered
  caswallon laughed

  well you have your northmen and
now nine-and-thirty britons forty of them
counting young glendwyr maybe my
men will catch a few more rebels for you
however a man needs enemies so they
shall let some go boy you belong to my
brother tros but all your fathers lands and
property are mine

  young glendwyr hung his head and the
men who held him would have tied his
wrist if tros had permitted but tros put
two northmen in charge of him which
stung the youngster less than if he had been
tied and mocked by his own countrymen
caswallon sent the other prisoners into
prisoners of war



lunden under guard to await tros dis-
position

  for the wine of excitement might go to
your head if i should leave you in charge of
them tonight tros you might try your
own turn at seizing lunden

  lunden is a good town but it would irk
me to have to govern it tros answered

  caswallon laughed turning his head to
listen to sounds approaching through the
mist wheels hoofs and a voice

  pledge me your promise he said sud-
denly

  tros hated promises like all men who
habitually keep them he regarded a blind
promise as stark madness yet there was
madness in the mist that night and all rules
went by the board he heard a gasp from
conops somewhere in the mist behind as
he raised his right hand and swore to do
whatever service caswallon might demand
of him

  he could see caswallon whispering to
 orwic and orwic passing word along but
it was conops who gave him the first inkling
that he might be called on that night for
performance conops and then helma
seizing his hand and pressing close against
him conops said

  master he will make a fool of you take
back that promise before he-

  helma said

  lord tros i am your wife is it not so
this is my night will you-

sounds in the mist interrupted
sounds that included one familiar
voice a chariot emerged into
the torch-glare horses snorting
clouds of vapor as they slid to a thundering
halt all feet together and the first face
tros recognized was fflurs the torchlight
in her eyes she looked like an avenging
goddess it was she who drove who reined
the horses in her hair all fury on her
shoulders

  i have them both she remarked

  her voice was flat-determined there
were issues in the mist that night

  a chariot behind hers plunged to a stand-
still and tros saw caesars womans face
white in the mist with skells beside hers
and skell looked like a ghost from beyond
the borderland of death with such fear in
his eyes as a beast shows in the shambles
his arms were tied so taut behind him that
his breast seemed ready to burst and the

sinews of his neck stood out like bowstrings

now prove you are a king caswallon
do a kings work fflur said and her voice

was flat again no music in it

  i will caswallon laughed bring
them i am good at kinging it

  but fflur appeared to doubt that she
watched like an avenging fury while men
dragged skell and the gaulish woman from
the chariot and stood them in front of cas-
wallon where he considered both of them
a minute without speaking

then suddenly he raised his voice and
though he spoke to all present it was plain
enough that his words were aimed at fflur-
shall a king protect mens property or
shall he squander it

 all knew the answer to that none
spoke not even fflur although she bit
her lip

 shall a king offend the druids or shall
he abide their teachings caswallon asked
speaking loud and high again

  they knew the answer to that too
none spoke except the gaulish woman
she cried aloud

  not the druids kill me

  then she began screaming and a man
clapped a cloth over her mouth desisting
when she grew calm

  as for this woman caswallon said
she was caesars slave and she now belongs
to tros-my brother tros

  the woman flung herself sobbing in the
mud at tros feet clinging to his legs crying
to him

  lord tros mercy i knew you were for
the lord caswallon i stabbed the lord
glendwyr lest he should slay you i am
your slave my knife is yours my life is
yours

  be still tros ordered gruffly

  he knew predicament was coming needed
all his wits to meet it emotion such as she
showed angered him and in anger there is
not much wisdom

  as for skell what say the druids
asked caswallon raising his voice louder
than before

  there was a murmur at that but skell
was speechless fear held him rigid the
whites of his eyes glistening caswallon
spoke again his head a little turned toward
fflur

  the druids say a good deed is for men
to repay-evil deeds are for the gods to
punish what say you


adventure

  there was murmuring again but no
words audible fflurs lips were white with
pressure and her eyes blazed as caswallon
turned to face her

  mother of my sons he said this skell
was once a friend of mine he helped when
lunden burned he helped rebuild it
shall i slay

  fflur answered him at last thin-lipped
breathing inward

  you will never listen to me it must
be your decision

  nay he answered laughing you are
always right what shall i do with him
do what you will you are the king
she answered angrily	

  caswallon laughed again

  true i should not forget i am the
king

  you let other men forget it fflur
retorted

  skell shall remember caswallon turned
from her and looked straight at tros
brother tros you have told me you will
build a ship for which you will need a great
crew just now you have made me a prom-
ise to do whatever i choose to ask was
that in good faith

  it was my spoken word said tros but
he answered guardedly-he did not care to
be public executioner even of such a treach-
erous sneak as he knew skell was

  then take skell he is your slave use
him set him on an oar-bench and sweat
the treason out of him work manhood in
for that must come from outside since what
he had of it he seems to have lost

  fflur laughed high-pitched and cynical
skell looked at tros as a tied steer eyes the
butcher

  slave he said wetting his lips with
his tongue i was born free oar-bench
aye tros answered loose him lest
his arms grow weak i will keep that
promise he said grinning at caswallon
his hands shall blister and his hams shall
burn if he has freedom in him he shall
earn it

  so they loosed skell and the northmen
took charge of him with low-breathed in-
sults despising him as neither norse nor
briton but a traitor to both races speaking
both tongues tros arms behind him
stared at the gaulish woman who was
kneeling in the mud

 mine he wondered mine by
pluto what should a seaman do with you

  and caswallon chuckled waiting the
woman tried to smile but fear froze her
again when helma stood beside tros taking
his hand to remind him of her rights

  i need no wench to wait on me said
helma

  you shall go to caesar tros said finally
you shall take my message to him

  you shall say whatever tros needs
that caesar has tros will take without
caesars leave or favor

  bid him send me no more slave-women
but guard himself against a blow that
comes and lest you he about that message
woman i will chisel it on bronze and rivet
that to a chain around your neck

  so then this business is over said
caswallon the druids wait send your
northmen back to lunden with your pris-
oners tros we must make haste

  he signed to the northmen to take the
prisoners away and offered tros and helma
places in the chariot beside him then
shouted to the team and drove like a mad-
man through the mist

  he said not another word until the horses
leaped a stream and the bronze wheels
struck deep into the far bank then when
they breasted a mist-wreathed hill beneath
dripping branches and he had glanced
over-shoulder to make sure fflur followed
and orwic and a score of mounted men
behind their chariots he tossed speech to
tros in fragments

  too many druids not enough king if
druids keep me waiting men say hah even
caswallon must cool his heels but if i
keep them waiting they say caswallon is
irreligious nevertheless unless i king it
carefully there will be neither king nor
druids

  and the druids know that they must
wait for me and i think that dawn is a
better time for funerals than midnight be-
cause at dawn men hope whereas at night
they are afraid

  so brother tros you shall attend your
fathers funeral after all and all my people
shall believe you are my friend i will bid
the druids thank you that lunden wasnt
plundered while they prayed on yon
horses ho there hi hi-yi which is
the hardest brother tros to king it or to
captain a ship at sea

  but tros did not know the answer to that
question he only knew which of the two
tasks he himself preferred
 n the fall havoc reigns on the
   tidal rivers and lagoons of the
   arctic coast

--	winter on the northern tun-

dra facing the sea is a simple affair calm
and great cold alternate with scourging
deadly blizzards but the water that was in
sea and rivers is as fixed as the land spring
unlocks the ice and moves it grandly forth
out of the ken of men summer dapples
with light and shade the dun hills and
coastal plains

  but october rouses this coast to ram-
pancy-as jim knight and joe woods
learned to their sorrow when weeks before
their planning they bucked scum ice all the
way across kotzebue sound broke the crust
nearly to the head of buckland lagoon and
wet half frozen and cursing volubly made
shore and camp on a dismal rocky point
getting their outfit ashore a box or a sack at
a time they had three dogs in their whale
boat and hickory strips and sticks for as fine
a basket sled as old alaskans could make

  the makings for it were hardly a sub-
stitute for the sled itself yet a sled then and
there would have done them no good for
there was no snow the air was deadly
cold and only winds and tides and the cur-
rent of the river playing the game of chaos

  chaos indeed it seemed to these men
from the interior a south wind blowing
the pacific water into the arctic and they

beheld the miracle of an off-shore wind
piling the sea on the beaches and backing
the waters of the lagoon and river until the
bordering flats were flooded the promon-
tories half-submerged and their beached
outfit threatened with drowning so higher
on the rocks they moved it sweating at the
task all night in a dark so dense they
bumped each other coming and going

  then while the risen waters were still
sustained by the south wind that blew over
half a continent new ice formed-half a
foot of it in a night and a day and when
the water finally subsided this ice sheet was
lowered upon the flats capping the summit
of every boulder and rock of the lagoon
shores and making queer ice-mushrooms
which later were built up by the snow into
strange ghostly shapes

  yet fall was not through with its tricks
the pent waters of the river released at
last found entry between the old and new
ice-crusts and coursing down the wide la-
goon raised the new ice to a normal level
and depressed the old wearing it through
here and there in a way no man but an
eskimo could know

  knight and woods knew nothing of this
when the weather settled but that the la-
goon seemed open again along the lines of
its normal channels and if they could
manage to obtain a flat boat or some sort
they could get their outfit-in which they


adventure

had invested every cent they could rake
together-out of that point of rocks and on
up the buckland to where they were going

  the rush to the south shores of kotzebue
-to candle and deering-was in its in-
fancy it was the first winter that white
men were to pass in that new placer-mining
region enterprising ones like knight and
woods shunned the immediate region of the
strike at candle and were piercing hith-
er and thither preparing to prospect new
streams these two men were the last to
come in by way of the sea

  they knew where candle town must lie-
westward over the low hills there must
be boats galore there they got the perish-
able part of their outfit into the shelter of
their tent fastened its flaps and struck
out for candle it was a days mush
over sodden slippery tundra a rime of half-
melted snow clogging their feet

nagachuck oldest of a small
group of eskimo who wintered
every few years on the buckland
five miles from the head of the
lagoon had been told by his nephew out
ptarmigan hunting in the interlude of good
weather that white men had landed in a
big boat near the coast he had walked
three miles to an eminence squinted his
piercing eyes against the glint of the sun
and seen for himself that this was true all
the way back he had glowered and mut-
tered to the dog that followed him

  nagachuck the mutterer he was or to be
exact the mutterer against white men
he was not criticized for this for his hate
was not without reason years before at
the end of a winter of unprecedented cold-
and marvellous prime fur-he had been
robbed not only of his furs but of his young
wife by some swift-moving miscreant white
-who was however not swift-moving
enough for nagachuck had hunted out
and killed him and after him another
whom nagachuck took to be the white
ones friend and therefore avenger

  nagachuck was a large man powerful
when meat was plentiful for a season and
quick and lithe always he was mild
enough with his kin wise in council as to the
sealing and his seniority-this with wis-
dom being the only needful qualifications
for such chieftainship as his people acknowl-
edged-gave him that influence which is
the all-sufficient substitute for authority

among the small half-nomadic groups of
alaskan eskimos

  when the first white miners came naga-
chuck counseled driving them away or kill-
ing them but his brethren only smiled
indulgently thinking this unnecessary and
absurd as well as unkind

  they had high hopes of better trading
than was possible with the whaling ships
that in ever-decreasing numbers had come
yearly to the sand-spits of kotzebue sound
when more whites came he had frowned and
muttered but said nothing for after all
they were in candle these ground-digging
white men let his brethren there the
kugarluk eskimo do as they might about
it the buckland was as yet uninvaded
but now

  when he returned he went straight to the
igloo of his son-in-law streechuck who-
strangely enough-was a white man one
ike holland an ex-whaler stranded years
before and given hospitality by the people
of nagachuck who himself happened to be
away at the time when he returned and
found his daughter already too much at-
tached to the scrawny almost toothless sail-
or for a seemly parting he gave the man
eskimo clothes taught him to use a spear
and made it plain to the white man-whose
years in the arctic had given him some
knowledge of their speech-that he would
be safe if he stayed

  whether streechuck stayed from choice
or virtual necessity he alone knew though
the natives thought nothing of it a fellow
white man might have regarded it as signif-
icant that streechuck ever kept aloof from
trading whites whenever a whale ship
lay in the sound ike holland was off hunt-
ing once only he wronged a native-stole
from him-but his wife forced him to make
restitution before the theft was discovered

  nagachuck in wrath told of his discovery
to his son-in-law who because he lacked
many things for which he hungered be-
came immediately interested and when
the gray-haired eskimo inquired of him
sternly how these whites who had invaded
the buckland were to be dealt with hol-
land cocking a shrewd eye answered that
there was but one safe way-to deprive
them of their most cherished possessions
so that they might be forced to go away
he offered to assist

  nagachuck was a man of hate not
avarice but had he not been just and-
the invincible tradition



since he was an eskimo-kind he would
much have preferred to kill the new-comers
should they persist in staying for though
the eskimo rarely kills he does not hesitate
to do so when he deems it necessary

  you are right he replied after think-
ing it over though i want none of their
goods we shall take that which they must
have thus forcing them to leave let us
find our dogs at once

  thus it was that when jim knight and
joe woods started westward at daybreak
next morning two pair of eyes observed their
departure from a clump of stunted willows
across the lagoon and when they returned
from candle town two days later they
found their tent rifled disgust and anger
vied with amazement for they would have
sworn the region was uninhabited what
particularly enraged them was the dis-
appearance of their strips of hickory
they had been unable to bring a boat
they must make a sled

  rapidly they noted the disappearance
of many things and thought the theft a
random catching up of a sled-load of food
and equipment but it was not that ike
holland long hungering for certain delec-
tables had made careful selection in par-
ticular he had always hated the stiff
clumsy eskimo sleds with their solid run-
ners and his greedy eyes had lighted covet-
ously at sight of the strips of clear straight-
grained hickory

  nagachuck had made demur at first to
the taking of the sled lumber for now
that the ice had come how could these men
get away he asked except with a sled but
holland replied that leaving them their
sled they would continue on up the buck-
land notwithstanding that he and naga-
chuck might deprive them of much of their
goods these white gold diggers being a per-
sistent and insolent crew but with their
sled wood vanished they would be dis-
couraged utterly and return again to candle
where they belonged

        knight and woods did in-
eed start back toward candle
ww	 was blood in their eye

          they wanted the aid of a deputy
marshal suddenly however when out
a mile knight grasped the shoulder of his
partner stopping him

  i reckon were-fools joe he ex-
claimed disgustedly one of us oughter

be enough to get that deppity feller those
hounds are gonna come back to our camp
and get more sures youre a foot high
ill sneak back and watch for em

  woods squinted at him aint they
liable to git you too

  not if i see em first replied knight
and i aim to do just that

  it was certainly a chanceful undertaking
savoring of suicide but that was jim
knight as any old-timer in the arctic knows

 reluctantly woods consented and
knight retraced his way to the bare
desolate camp above the ice-festooned
rocks of the promontory

  these rocks at once shaped themselves
to the designs of the irate miner he took
from the tent some food which could be
eaten raw-crackers canned milk cheese
dried fruit-and his caribou-skin bag and
found a nook among the mushroom rocks
which commanded a view both of the tent
and its approaches

  solaced by his pipe he began the long
watch nothing whatever happened dur-
ing that day night came and the miner
slept his common sense telling him that the
thieves would not choose darkness to re-
new their robbery of a camp which was
deserted in the day-time late next morn-
ing his vigil was rewarded

  ike holland had convinced his father-in-
law that they had not yet reduced the pos-
sessions of the invaders sufficiently to crip-
ple them and force them to retreat

  knight saw them crossing the lagoon-
boldly enough it seemed he did not know
that they were very wary of the ice es-
pecially where the lagoon glittered he
crouched more closely within the rock niche
that concealed him as the two men drove
their scraggly dogs directly for the tent

  he tried to see if they were armed but he
could observe upon them only the sailors
sheath knives which coast natives usually
carry these gave him no concern but he
would have given much to know if the sled
concealed a rifle the one gun which he
and woods possessed an old winchester
was among the articles missing from the
tent knight was armed with a colt re-
volver he formed his plan which was a
simple one though bold

  he would let them take more it would
be mainly grub for most of the non-eat-
ables were already gone if he tried to cap-
ture them now he might never learn where


adventure

those more valuable parts of the outfit had
been taken he wanted to be sure and the
surest way to learn was to let them steal
more cross the lagoon and from the other
side take their course-north or south or
east he hoped they would stay until
dusk or dark so he might follow them un-
observed

  yet he determined to follow them anyhow
and to capture them if he could the plans
one weak spot was due to his ignorance of
the ways of arctic coast ice

  the thieves remained in the tent a long
while and knight began to hope they would
not emerge until the early shadows de-
scended on the lagoon in this he was dis-
appointed they began to make trips to
the sled loading it but lightly

  goin easy on us this time he won-
dered or have they got all they want

  no ike holland had not all he wanted
there was quite another reason for the light
loading of the sled

  the thieves made off slantwise across
the lagoon the old eskimo ahead guiding
the white man at the clumsy handlebars
and jim knight crawled out of his retreat
not bothering to drag after him his skin bed

  he had a little food and kindlings in his
parkas breast pouch on his hip was his
colt and in his heart a murderous anger

  he dodged around the rocks to the side
of the tent and from this cover peeped out
and watched the moving line upon the ice
when it was half a mile away he pulled his
heavy gauntlet mitts tight upon his hands
shoved his parka sleeves snugly into them
and crawled out upon the ice his overalls
were new and of brown duck the ice was
dry this was because the tide was out
but he did not know that

  on hands and knees like a bear he made
forward rapidly from hummock to hum-
mock among the protruding ice-capped
rocks of the shallow shore they would
expect no pursuit they would probably not
look back if they did they would not
be likely to see him never mind that-
though he much preferred to get their true
course homeward before he was observed

  in fifteen minutes-he had to crawl low
now for he was beyond the shelter of the
protruding rocks-he raised his head oc-
casionally and saw that the thieves veered
constantly this enabled him to lessen the
distance between them but when sud-
denly he found the ice wet he decided it

would be imprudent in that air to crawl
longer he must keep dry so he arose
and walked in a crouched-over posture
watching the men ahead of him with all his
eyes to note if they observed him ap-
parently they did not observe him

  apparently jim knight a forthright
man a forthright fighter was no sleuth
versed in the ways of rat-like guilt-con-
scious men nor of the always alert natives
he had been observed from the first mo-
ment he emerged from the rocks and
ike holland and nagachuck had divined
his intentions and planned to kill him

  the old eskimo obsessed with the not
ignoble purpose of ridding his people of the
invading all-consuming strangers would
have shot him out of hand but he was
half-cracked from the shocks of years before
-as ike holland was aware-and little
knew or recked of the consequences not
so holland whose constant care both before
and since he became a squaw-man had
been the keeping of a whole skin he re-
minded nagachuck that under the white-
mans law absurdly forced upon them by
these aliens theft was much less of an
offense than killing

  the tides would still run for a number of
days and obliterate the signs of the sled
but a killed white man would freeze in yet
not be covered up until the uncertain com-
ing of the big snow and lying there on the
ice would point the way to white pursuers
let them then lure him farther-to where
the ice was thin and the buckland water
flowed beneath the body would never be
seen until next summer in the open arctic
if it were not consumed before then

  so never turning their heads to warn the
white man that he had been seen they
veered gradually toward the head of the la-
goon and nearer and nearer to its channels
where tide water merging with the outflow
of the river obscured the treachery of its
undermining

  jim knight not relishing a sprawl in
water to duck a rifle bullet hurried after
them and when he judged the distance right
for his purpose bawled to them to stop

ike holland turned it
would have been useless to pre-
tend he did not hear in the dead-
level silence of the lagoon he
gave one quick look and pretended alarm
he called to his father-in-law to swerve
the invincible tradition

i

again and go faster but soon their pace
slowed once more

  jim knight smiled there was no rifle
he might follow as he pleased and try to
take them with his revolver they might
escape him with a counter revolver fire or
by the speed of their dogs once the ice was
smooth and dry b ut he would know where
he and woods and the deppity were to
seek them-and the loot so on he went
sloshing rapidly through water ankle-deep
imagining that where they could go with
their sled he could follow with his two good
feet encased in high water-tight skin boots

  nagachuck would have steered now for
the thin ice of the left channel and when
the pursuer should attempt the crossing
would have shot him trusting to the river
water to complete the eating out of the new
ice and carry the body down but holland
was more careful he took the lead guided
his victim with sinister consummate cun-
ning to a place where no rifle bullet would be
needed to stop him

  it was the splitting point of the two chan-
nels nearer and nearer he drew toward that
cul-de-sac of the forking channels where as
he knew ice-bridges still firm for a sled but
fatal for a man might always be found un-
der the surface flow

  alternately slithering along on dry ice
and sloshing through water came jim
knight gaining on them his revolver in his
hand reckless with rage and the thought of
victory and when he saw the team dart-
ing this way ahd that after the searching
holland he was sure they sought only a shal-
low place to cross the line of water so that
they might wet as little as possible of the ill-
gotten contents of their sled and he
caring little now for a wetting forged
straight toward them and was soon knee-
deep in water

  holland coaxing the dogs slipped by
them toward the sled-very cautiously in
reality but this was lost upon jim knight
then holding to the sled gaining thus the
help of its wide bearing surface on the ice-
bridge beneath he and nagachuck passed
swiftly over and canting slightly upward
from the channel gained the firmer though
still surmerged ice

  knight feeling the water rising upon him
followed the way of the sled this was
easy for the men he pursued had slowed-
purposely to guide him thus he came to
the shallower part-the ice-bridge-chuck-

ling to himself that he would dog their foot-
steps to their land trail might even capture

them bodily

  suddenly in he crashed

  it is a strange kind of crash-through
rotten submerged ice it lacks the all-im-
portant element of sound but the startled
fear-sickened inner senses supply this and
jim knight felt flindering ice heard the dry
almost metallic breaking through and his
heart contracted sharply at the going down
down of his leg

  ike holland his head partly turned walk-
ing slowly his hand on the sled saw the sud-
den side lurch of the pursuing miner and
knew it was the beginning of the end he
cried to his dogs and hurried away for
lacking the animus of personal hatred the
dregs of the humanity still in him made him
reluctant to look upon the death-struggles
of the ice-trapped man

it was well for him that he
moved rapidly for knight in
leaping rage thrust up his re-
volver and shot at the scrawny
white devil who was brisking away-a ges-
ture of vengeance that seemed a precious
moment wasted yet the effort pitching
his slanted body over plunged the hand
with the revolver into the water to find the
ice and thrust him straight again

  he struggled to regain footing in the rot-
ten stuff he could tread but could not see
flailing the water with beating arms and
churning feet upholding himself moment
after moment by the mere strength and
rapidity of these sailings like a clock run-
ning down

  nagachuck forgetting momentarily that
the stranger was their intended victim
looked with perplexity at the fleeing squaw-
man for this was not a time when natives
flee but at once he remembered their
purpose-remembered his hate of these de-
spoilers of the hunting and trapping and
sealing grounds of his brethren and he
stood and looked on the work of himself
and the squaw-man unafraid to confront
it he even came nearer to the brink-
near enough to see the piteous look of horror
in the staring eyeballs of the doomed
man

  then the centuries worked upon him-
centuries of survival of a people isolated
upon the rim of the world in long darkness
desolate cold a people that had survived


adventure

only because they had learned union help-
fulness brotherhood

  to paddle together the frail skin boat in
foaming seas to strike together under the
fangs and claws of the great white bear to
rescue to revive to feed to the hungry their
last bit of frozen fish their last drop of oil
to scale the black cliff for the first wild-
fowl eggs for the sick child of a friend to
count their own strength their own breath
as but part of the strength and breath of all
-this was the very salt of the blood that
coursed through the veins of nagachuck

  even the cruel wrong that had racked him
a life-time could not gainsay it for what
is a life-time in the life of a race-a race
grown into the very image of the tradition
that has upheld it and made it to survive
nagachucks life-time fled away as he looked
in the agonized face of the valiantly strug-
gling man leaving him only eskimo tin-
gling surcharged with the fervors of an in-
vincible tradition

  over his head he jerked off his long parka
whipped it twistingly into the air until it
resembled a six-foot length of clumsy rope
and himself flat on the margin ice his up-
bent head alone free of the water flung out
the parka end to the desperately plunging
drowning man

  only a moment it was before jim knight
would have been sucked into the depths of
the channel lagoon slime beneath ice above
ceiling him as in a tomb he snatched at
the twisted parka at its neck and the knot-
like hood gave the miners fingers a sure
hold on the garment

  backward crawled nagachuck and called
in his gutturals to the drowning man to
spread-out spread-out for knight was
still churning with his feet breaking down
destroying his only means of escape-the
up-bearing surface of the submerged ice

  it was only when the native illustrated
raising legs and arm and spraddling them
out on the ice that knight understood him
and threw his limbs and body straight out
then though he sank for a moment stout
old nagachuck was able to draw him up-
ward to solid ice-and safety

  panting shivering with strength only
to keep his head above the water he lay
staring into the inscrutable dark eyes of the
alien man and nagachuck returned his
stare with neither love nor hate for he was
bewildered wondering at what he had done
wondering still more why he had done it

  slowly the gray-haired eskimo came to
his feet and lifted the miner up and to-
gether they walked ashore and the native
made a fire having matches in a small
hollowed bone fitted so closely to its cover
that no months soaking could wet it long
before ike holland and the team had be-
come like a fine of insects moving across the
tundra plain southward

  when the two were nearly dry-eelooit
alucktok-yougo-said nagachuck ges-
turing the man away

  there was emotion in his voice for he
had come to decision he too would go-
in an opposite direction to the far seelawik
where there were no hills of gold where no
white despoilers would be tempted to follow
he would send back his message to his
people to demolish their igloos and with the
coming of the big snow to pack their meagre
all upon their sleds and follow him to their
old grounds on the inland seelawik lakes

  without further word to the white man he
turned his face to the north and walked
away

  jim knight his strength recovered
stared upon the retreating back of the
strange being that had robbed him lured
him toward death-and snatched him from
its hideous maw then he faced about
jog-trotted around the shore of the lagoon
and by the early stars took a westerly
course for candle

  just before darkness closed he descried
figures approaching a moment later he
was face to face with his partner joe woods
and a deppity they held quick con-
verse-too quick for the telling of the last
part of the story

  where did they go asked the deputy
marshal

  jim knight pointed out into the darkness

  south he answered both of them

i

t was a chilly dreary night in
early november a fine misty
rain was falling and the passers-by
along the waterfront walked swift-
ly and with their coat collars turned high
about their ears

  water dripped from the eaves of houses
and fell splashing into the dirty streetsand
the harbor lights red white and green
blinked gloomily river crafts their out-
lines dim and vague swept by like ghostly
shadows a policeman in a friendly door-
way with his hands deep in his pockets and
his club beneath his arm wished himself at
home and watched with slight interest the
two men before him on the curb

  one was a tall man big of frame but lean
and emaciated he faced the walk and
eyed closely from beneath the brim of his
draggled slouch hat the faces of all that
passed the other was a short pudgy man
with a square frank face who pulled
roughly at the arm of his companion in an
endeavor to draw him away

  come on dolan you fool the small
man was saying dont stand here gawk-
ing like a lunatic man youre like a race
horse up and down the water front
around the docks from ship to ship like a
wild man give it up its no go hes
gone from the ship dye hear me gone
come sit down and rest have some coffee
you need it

  the other shook him off impatiently
no no he said in a hoarse growl
hes not gone ill find him men of the
sea always come back even the rotten

hulks of men three years-my-

  he shivered and his wan cheeks lean and
drawn indeed like those of an over worked
race horse twitched spasmodically with the
working of his mouth

  ill find him- he looked closely at his
companion as if forgetful of his identity-
carrell and when i do- he lifted his
hands and twined his long slender fingers
about an imaginary throat

  come on carrell persisted he point-
ed to a cheap restaurant a few doors
away have something to eat and some
coffee

  no he might pass did i ever tell

you what he did listen-

  i have heard it a dozen times but ill
listen again if youll come in with me
will you will you the tall man
grasped the other delightedly by the arm
ill go then you dont think hell pass
do you eh he bent and looked into
the small mans face

  no he wont pass come on with
dolans arm in his he led the way toward the
eating place

the policeman deprived of his only
object of interest sank deeper into his coat
poor dolan he murmured crazy as




adventure

a loon these three years and him once
chief officer of a crack liner 

  he shook his head sadly reaching into
his pocket he drew forth a plug of tobacco
and after glancing warily up and down the
street bit off a huge piece

  hes bad tonight always is when it
rains donno but what i aught to run
him in for safe keepin-guess hes harm-
less though

     in the restaurant dolan with
    v his food untouched before him
    was talking excitedly across the
    table to carrell

   twas the penguin he was saying the
old penguin just north of watling we hit
a derelict bottom up tore the bow com-
pletely out of us it did i was mate and
he was master i went forward and down
into number one hold to look at the damage
she was down by the bow and settlin but
there was a bulkhead still holding aft of the
forward hold it was weak and bound to
give and i told the captain i knew she
was goin twas two oclock in the morning
when we took to the boats the captain
was a miserable coward he went wild
with fear poor jim mullins-didja know
jim-and i were the last to start for
the boats

  the captain stood at the rail and trem-
bled and couldnt talk straight he was so
scared it was rough you know he
wouldnt let jim and i slide down into the
boat said there wasnt room enqugh he
lied-there was room for a dozen he was
just a cowardly swine shot jim he did-
through the head then lost his gun and beat
me over the head with a stanchion right
here see

  he leaned foreward and traced with his
fingers a ragged scar that ran from his left
ear half across his head

  i fell in the water-way and lay there all
night-jim washed away over the side the
wind died down and it started to rain it
rained until morning and i lay there rolling
around in the water way then the sun
came up and it was hot-hot as - i
wanted water-tried to crawl and couldnt

no water-hot as - then-then-

he was wandering then-

  then you were picked up by a-

  yes thats right i was picked up by a
ship-a tramp all red she was-red lead
you know i think she was a tramp

couldnt see very well-my eyes were all
full of blood id been layin in it all
night it was in my eyes and-and-
and-

  yes yes forget it old man-eat your

food

  oh all right

  his eyes calmed and he fell to ravenously
for a while then looking up suddenly with
the old wild light he said

   twas north of watling dya mind
and it rained-

  will you eat the small man thumped
on the table in mock anger

  yes but listen dolans eyes were
gleaming savagely i wanta tell you im
sailing tomorrow-on the estrella del norte
-did you know it bosun-bosun-forget
his name-used to be with me on the ta-
boga-gave me a job-ab i got a reason
see im gettin closer to him-oh i can
tell-feel it here when it rains

  he placed the palm of his hand upon the
livid scar 

  when it rains like north of watling dya
see and the sun-

mit was hot with the sultry hu-
midity that proceeds the short
fierce squall of the tropics in the
stuffy forecastle reeking with the
stench of sweating men the sailors in the
double tier of bunks rolled restlessly in their
sleep a boy with the pale skin of the city
dweller lay fully clothed in a bunk on his
back with his legs dangling sidewise into
the narrow aisle

  a stocky blond-mustached man bearing
the marks of a true sailor stepped over the
sill and into the forecastle he stared about
for a moment in the light of the smoky oil
lamp bracketed on the after end of the
quarters then seeing the boy sprawled in
the bunk he strode over and kicked roughly
at the dangling feet

  up ye scut he said in a low growl
break out of it he kicked again at the
feet

  huh said the lad and he sat up and
rubbed his lids apart

 get up-ye

  the man grasped the boy by the arm and
yanked him to his feet

  mate wants is coffee

  yeah the boy stretched lazily and
stamped his feet to start the circulation in
his legs what time is it he asked
north of watling



  quarter of two and cut thet stompin
er yell rouse all hands

  the lad stretched again and yawned
loudly with a calm unconcern of whom he
awakened

  where are we he asked presently

  north of watling i heered the mate
say answered the other and he slumped
down upon a stool and reached for his pipe
a form in a bunk at his back twisted un-
easily

  the boy started toward the door stopped
and turned north of what he asked

  north of watling ye fool roared the
man he made a menacing move and the
boy scuttled through the open doorway
the man in the berth stirred sighed heavily
and sat up

  the impending squall came down with a
rush from the northeast and the estrella del
norte began to pitch and roll in the quarter-
ing swell the wind came first in puffs
then in a steady thunder of wind and flying
spray that sent the half empty freighter
heeling far over to leeward a flash of blue
lightning streaked downward and licked
the tops of the foam crested waves in the
distance

  from the open door of the sailors fore-
castle came a man in a long oilskin and
a souwester he was a tall man lean of
statue and with cheeks drawn like those of a
tired race horse and he made his way along
the heaving deck with the assurance of a
born sailor

  he went aft to the bridge mounted the
ladder and stepping into the pilot house
stopped before the chart board illuminated
by the downcast rays of a shaded electric
lamp with parallel rulers and dividers he
stepped off several distances in the rapid
manner of the skilled navigator then
dropped them with a sigh

 north of watling he murmured
north of watling the man at the wheel
glanced over his shoulder at the dim form
bending over the chart board and then re-
sumed his steering

  above on the bridge captain bleibtree
a big full-faced man with a loose mouth
and small pig-like eyes clenched both hands
tightly about the stanchion before him and
turned to his mate

  mr nordstrom he said in a thin high-
pitched voice will you go and see to the

he looked fearfully at the mounting swells
and his lips quivered

  shes safe as a church said mr nord-
strom and his mouth was sneering but
ill look her over capn just the same

  he clumped angrily across the bridge and
down the port ladder the captain crouched
in the corner and hung on

  he felt the presence of some one and
turning saw a tall form erect and swaying
easily to the roll of the vessel at his elbow

  well have to leave her capn the

the forward water-tight bulkhead it cant
hold long-i put my hand on it and its
trembling when it gives shell go down
like a shot

  there was a familiar ring of authority to
the voice and the words sent the captain
back against the rail in fright what-
what he gasped

  we must take to the boats the
man leaned close and stared into captain
bleibtrees face why youre afraid
he exclaimed wonderingly well take
to the boats dya hear right away

adventure

here a minute ago then to the captain
wheres jim-jim mullins

  at the mention of the name captain
bleibtree threw an arm before his face
and cowered further into his corner my
- he cried who are you

  i-i- the man wiped his eyes with
the back of his hand and muttered vaguely

  his military attitude was gone and he
was back in his accustomed slouch the
main force of the squall had passed and the
rain coming after spattered upon the lean
cheeks with the first dash of cool water
his features underwent a transformation and
his eyes glowed in the darkness like living
coals he pointed a long forefinger at the
master and his mouth worked with a fierce
hatred

  ah now i know at last-you-cap-
tain bleibtree you-the coward--the mur-
derer you-who shot jim mullins and left
me to go down with the penguin-in the
rain-the sun the heat-no water look
at me im dolan dont you know me
look here

  he bared his head and exhibited the scar
showing white through his thin hair

  you did that you dog ill strangle
you-tear the heart out of you-with
these

  he advanced and grasped the fear strick-
en captain by the throat with his claw-like
fingers with these-in the rain-north
of watling you swine

when forced into a corner the
most craven of men will fight
back and it is often the cowardly
fear-crazed man who is the most
dangerous captain bleibtree though wild-
eyed and blubbering with fright fought
with a savage ferocity that equalled that of
the avenger

  he exerted all the strength of his powerful
body in a vain attempt to tear from his
throat the hands that were slowly throttling
him

  across the bridge they struggled then
back again to the corner where dolan
forced the captain to his knees and wrenched
fiercely at the flesh within his grasp the
captain was weakening but with a last des-
perate effort he threw himself backward and
kicked straight out with both feet catching
the other above the ankles and sending him
toppling to the deck where his head struck
solidly against the rivet studded angle-iron

he rolled over and twisted convulsively
with blood running from the corners of his
mouth and down along his mottled throat
the captain arose and still in the throes of
a mortal fear and mad with a demoniacal
hatred of the man who had menaced him for
three years he seized the limp form in his
arms and sent it hurling over the rail and
into the sea then with his face ghastly but
with his mouth quivering with relief he
leaned weakly against the rail and stared out
into the murk astern

   he started at a voice but was unable to
turn she is all right capn it said
and the squall is over anyway i figured
the position and we are fourteen miles
north of watling

  the captain with his arms frozen about
the stanchion before him gasped trembled
and stared fearfully into the night

on the bridge deck of the
freighter estrella del norte an-
chored in cristobal harbor and
only waiting for morning to go
alongside the dock captain bleibtree lolled
in his canvas deck chair and gazed lazily
over the stern at the lights of the twin
cities cristobal and colon he was ex-
tremely comfortable and although there
was a slight feeling of uneasiness lurking
some where in the dim recesses of his mind
he was content

  the menace of three years the vague
shadow that had haunted his dreams the
constant threat of vengeance that had
dogged his footsteps had been removed-
fortunately without trace a seaman had
disappeared at sea-that was all

  such an occurance was not unusual and
was nothing to cause undue comment he
had entered it in the log written an official
report of the happening to be sent to the
authorities upon arrival and in the cap-
tains opinion the matter was closed

  all was well and he rubbed his hands in
a satisfied manner then settled deeper in his
chair and fell to watching the ever-changing
clouds that scurried across the evening sky

  it was a night to gladden the heart the
clouds rolling in great fleecy balls over the
sea rim and sailing swiftly across the gray-
blue inverted saucer of sky reflected from
their under surface the silvery light of the
moon not yet above the eastern horizon and
the trade wind hardly more than a breeze
and laden heavily with its burden of spicy
north of watling



aromas from the shores of hispaniola
sighed through the shrouds

  the long rollers of the restless caribean
spent themselves against the breakwaters
and the little ship bow to the sea and tug-
ging gently at her chain heaved and sighed
as she nodded to the passing swells that
crept into the bay over head a gannet
black and white and squawking raucously
planed and whirled and overside a school
of flying-fish flitted and splashed along the
starlit surface

  the captain lolled luxuriously and smiled
contentedly at the sky on the tarpaulin-
covered top of number two hatch just for-
ward of the bridge a group of sailors were
assembled and their voices came up to him
in a faint murmur

  a puff of tobacco smoke drifted up and
sailed off to leeward for lack of a more
interesting occupation he began listening
idly to the voices

  the mess-boys thin high voice was the
first to make itself clear

  -and then he went along the port side
and up into the pilot house then out again
and up the bridge ladder then i dont
know where he went it was im all right

and i betcha-

  whut wuz thet boy broke in a
gruff voice evidently that of a newcomer
whut dye say ye seen

  a man who walks around the decks
every night at two oclock piped the lad
a stranger nobody knows who he is
three nights now i seen im so did bill
allen and coogan i dont know where he
comes from nor where he goes but he walks
about every night yes he does i tell you
i seen im

  aw rats said a strange voice some-
bodys been tellin you ghost stories

  i dunno about that a puff of smoke
wafted upward and in his minds eye the
captain could see chips the ancient ships
carpenter sitting with crossed legs and his
short black pipe between his teeth ye
never kin tell strange things happn aboard
o ships i kin tell ye i remember oncet in
the old nancy b a three-masted bark she

wuz from capetown to boston with-

  got nuthin to do wit th estrella said
the gruff voice and i kinda think th
kid might be right thought i saw sum-
thin tother night myself

  well who do you think it was asked
the scornful one with a laugh

        why dolan of course the
iq lads voice was shrill and clear
vwaf  saw m anfl  looked just like
im not his face of course was
too dark for that but i mean his figure
and so did allen see im and coogan
didnt you

  there were two grunts of assent and
the boy continued hes come back to
haunt us maybe he was thrown over the
side instead of fallin over how do we
know

   rats scoffed the dissenter

  then you stay up tonight and see im i
dare you it makes cold shivers go down
your back to see im parade around the
decks i tell you it is dolan who went over
the side north of-north of-what was it
again mike

  - north of watling

  captain bleibtree arose slowly from his
chair his mouth was twitching and the
pouches of flesh beneath his small eyes were
loose and flabby the hunted look was
again in his eyes and he suddenly felt very
tired-and afraid again even after death
a death which he had witnessed with his own
eyes the spirit of the man he had wronged
persisted in holding over his head the threat
of vengeance

  was the shadow of this man this hatred-
maddened creature with a mind crippled by
the captains blow to darken the remainder
of his life as it had darkened the past three
years captain bleibtree in spite of his
pusillanimous nature did not believe in
ghosts or the supernatural but he was en-
tirely at a loss to account for the figure re-
sembling dolan which the sailors had been
so certain they had seen

  sailors tales must always be received
with a wide margin of leeway he knew
but even so when three men had said
positively that they had seen the same
strange form on three consecutive nights
he reasoned that there was something to
the story that lifted it above a mere fore-
castle yarn

  the late tragedy was still fresh in his
mind and the solemnity of the night the
sigh of the wind in the rigging the eerie
moonlight that now bathed the surface of
the swelling water the gull that planed and
whirled the enchantment of a night ghastly
in its somber beauty all these lent their aid
in furthering the chain of thought started
by the sailors gossip


adventure 

  he went to his room and threw himself
fully clothed on the settee and after a lapse
of some time during which his distorted
fancy ran wild with dread imaginings of
ghosts bent on revenge of icy talons that
reached for his throat and vague forms
that glided silently by in the darkness of
spectral shapes with lean tight-skinned jaws
and jagged scars he fell into a restless
vision-haunted slumber and lay his body
tortured by the vagaries of his mind tossing
and writhing in the darkness

         there was a feeling of impend-
ing tragedy in the air overhead
the moon shone with a dull splen-
dor but in the northeast black
clouds were mounting and the trade wind
carried a threat of rain

  the gull had sailed off shoreward and the
flying-fish were somewhere deep down in the
purple depths there was only the soft lap
of water against the sides of the estrella del
norte to break the silence of the night as
the vessel rolled drowsily in the swell her
masts and rigging threw weird shadows
wavering across the grey decks

  in the semi-darkness of the little wheel-
house only lighted by the moonbeams that
came through the small round ports stood
a man garbed in boots oil skin coat and
souwester

  he was a tall man and big of frame but
his face bent low over the dark square of
the chart board upon which there was no
chart was indistinguishable

  his fingers were moving slowly over the
smooth surface and his mouth was moving
in silent speech he straightened sighed
heavily murmured vaguely and moved to-
ward the door

  outside he circled the house mounted
the port ladder crossed the bridge stared
with vacant eyes over the side and aft and
then stood shuddering of a sudden he
turned and his eyes wide glassy and
staring were filled with horror

  a sprinkle of rain from the passing rain
cloud overhead spattered upon his face and
hands and mixed with the cold perspiration
of fear

  he stepped back and then forward and
with one hand clutching his throat warded
off an unseen foe with the other

  ah he gasped again you ill do
for you this time you fiend

  he sprang forward and still clutching his

throat with his left hand struck viciously
at the empty air with his right

  he gave a gruesome imitation of a man
fighting a desperate battle for his life claw-
ing and striking heavy blows with his free
hand which landed upon nothing all the
while cursing mouthing foul epithets and
jabbering an insane mixture of fear and
hatred

  the cloud above spilled more of its liquid
contents and the mans wet oilskins glis-
tened dully still he fought on half across
the bridge then back to the corner where
his imaginary assailant wrenched him to his
knees

   let me go he finally pleaded in spite of
the iron fingers that were slowly taking his
life let me go i give in do you hear
i shot jim mullins i drowned you-im
sorry i was maddened with fear let go
dolan let go youre killing me stop

man for-s sake stop dya hear have

pity-have- ah

  through lips covered with foam and blood
he screamed hoarsely then fell writhing to
the deck

  when he came to he was spread-eagled
upon his back in the center of the bridge a
sailor astride his legs and one upon each
arm

  through half-opened lids he saw the
chief officer standing at his feet and just
behind him stood the second officer the
mess boy was strutting boastfully in the
back ground

  didnt i tell you the latter was saying
exultantly didnt i i knew there was
something wrong you betcha

  you were right lad answered the
second mate and you called me just in
time a moment later and we might have
been too late

  a somnambulist said the chief officer
wonderingly

  more than that the second mate
said with a shake of his head a form
of mania caused most likely by dolans
threats of death which we have all been
hearing about the docks for the last three
years preying upon a guilty conscience
and the strangest part of it is he throttled
a confession from himself

  well you see said mr nordstrom
twas the weather just like north of wat-
ling-and it rained

  captain bleibtree gasped groaned twist-
ed convulsively and swooned
author of out of the junglethe courage medicine etc

-ho calls for theophilo da costa

         who is in trouble now about the
upper rivers oho a senhor
- gringo bom what can i do
for the senhor

 the name is-how faraday senhor
i desolate myself you have me in disad-
vantage the senhors illustrious name is
no indentification to me

  a letter from your son who says that i
have befriended him and gives the direction
for your reply in the care of my name
alas senhor that the fact is still no identi-
fication i am theophilo of the upper
rivers and i have befriended many mens
sons-and many mens sons deu gragas
have befriended me else i should not be
here perhaps you would be so good then

to tell me some detail some little-

  a lad you say who came to wrest a for-
tune out of our wilderness yes there
have been many such and he wrote to
you to say that he was doing well but that
capital was needed to expand his business
against the hostility of competitors and
so you have come to save him from all the
manifold dangers of this savage outland of
ours that beset him from all sides

  oho i know now why that would be
none other than the pelloroxo-the red
one senhor it is an honor to me to meet
the distinguished father of my friend but
carramba how should we of the upper rivers

know that his name might be faraday or
what it might be pelloroxo we called
him the fire-head and what should we
know or care besides for we of the rivers
are wanderers of the waterways standing
each man to himself by the things he does
not like these city people of manaos who
set great store by names and families and by
the things their grandfathers have done

  but come with me to a quiet corner sen-
hor where we can talk at ease over our little
burnt coffee and i will give you all the news
of this son of yours whom i have left not so
long ago seated behind a tree with a rifle
across his knees

       he came as you have said to
make a fortune out of the wild-
erness wide-eyed eager bus-
xa tling or as he boasted it hus-
tling asking innumerable questions about
the affairs of everybody and expecting
everybody to confide in him with as much
friendliness as he in them and demanding
ever to be called by his first name

  but it is foolish of me senhor to describe
your own son to you for these extraor-
dinary peculiarities must have made them-
selves manifest to you long since

  no is it possible then that this is a type
in your country for there have been
others though this one had a talent for
evoking hostility yet there have been


o

adventure

others again who have been whole men-as
also your son senhor

  do not mistake for in the course of
time i have deemed him my friend but
it is necessary that i make clear to you how
some of these curious ways of his impressed
us the people of amazonas in order that
you may understand some of the vicissitudes
that he brought upon himself

  it is perhaps difficult for you as it was
for him to realize that he was a foreigner
here in a strange city and that as such it
behooved him to deport himself circum-
spectly but in this matter you ameri-
canos are like the ingleses only not so bad
there was not an action of this lads that
did not jar upon the sensibilities of the resi-
dents consider senhor

  there is no manner of doubt that america
of the north is the greatest and most pro-
gressive of the americas yet we of the
south do not care to have forced upon us the
insistent conviction that we are an outlying
and a primitive people and that of all our
manners and customs and doings there is
not one which is not done better or not
done at all in the north

  yet the lad meant no offense he spoke
only his inborn conviction while conversing
with the utmost friendliness not a sub-
ject was there but presently he would be
able to hold himself no longer and would
say well now in the united states-
and he would proceed to tell all and sundry
how much better the thing was done in his
country you understand the irritation no

  and if his listeners out of courtesy would
permit him to continue he would enlarge
upon his theme showing in detail how much
better the thing was done in his particular
petty township than in all the rest of those
united states a veritable patriotic illness
he had

  we of the south have a conception of the
north as some forty or so united states
yet this youth divided them into three
parts those of the two former he spoke
with animosity and derision while some
central townlet or other the name of which
nobody had ever heard he extolled as
gods own country

  i was here in manaos at the time and
having listened to a two-hour exposition of
the excellence of his home town sanitary
system as compared with that of manaos-
where it was true we had the yellow fever-
i laughed and laid my hand on his shoulder

  my son said i when the people of
this town have driven you from among
them do not lose heart but come on up to
us of the upper rivers and who knows but
that you may be one of the lucky ones for
whom fortune waits in this vast amazonas
of ours

  for i said to myself that this lad with
his clear eyes and his strong nose and his
wide mouth and with his restless energy
looked to have the makings of a man-if
indeed his enthusiasms should outlast the
rebuffs which would be his portion here
and the good god knows that this amazo-
nas of ours needs men to develop its great
resources

  but he he looked at me with agreat won-
der in his eyes and wanted to know why
should the good people of manaos ever be
hostile to him they were his friends he
liked them and he had no enemies yet
what could i say meu deus i am no
evangelist to explain to youth its short-
comings so i wished him well and left
him much mystified to learn in the only
school in which youth ever learns that of
experience

  and the first of the lessons came soon
enough in the full publicity of the teatro
central it occurred some foolish picture
was showing depicting the life of your
vaqueiros in which men rode among cattle
and in and out of clapboard villages at a
pace never less than a gallop and shot each
other with a pistol to each hand

  now we of the south can never under-
stand this anomaly how you of the most
progressive north can abide such lawlessness
at your very doors and in this matter we
think ourselves superior for in our great
plains where the herds run in their vast
thousands we do not permit murder by the
heroic wholesale

  yet this lad of yours conversing with a
couple of other gringos his companions
made some remark to the effect that it sur-
prized him having been in manaos three
months now not to have witnessed some
such exciting lawlessness and he cited with
an amazing twist of pride the number of men
killed yearly by pistols in some town or
other of yours of equal population to ours

  whereupon a young hothead of the city
sitting behind him who understood english
as do most of our better class youths could
contain himself no longer and leaning for-
ward he tapped the other on the shoulder
jungle business



and demanded with some asperity whether
he thought that manaos city was such a
town of pioneer savagery

  you must remember senhor that ma-
naos city while situated indeed at the exact
verge of civilization possesses modern
electric lighting and water and tramway
systems a ten story brewery a two-million-
dollar opera house with a capacity of four
thousand and a system of floating docks
capable of accommodating the largest ocean
liners so the local patriots indignation
can well be understood but to his ques-
tion your lad must needs reply with wonder
in his eyes and somewhat indignant himself
at the brusk interruption

  why-we yes i kinder thought that
id see some excitement way out here

  well que carramba what happens when
youth argues with hot youth words
make more words and many words make
blows i have regretted that i was not
present to witness that fight but the tale
of it made good telling in the cafes for a
week or two

  it began with the interchange of such in-
effectual blows as men may deal in the half-
dark over the backs of benches and pro-
ceeded then by mutual consent into the
passageway between the seats where there
was more room who struck whom or how
hard could not be seen but in a moment the
theater was in an uproar women of
course shrieked-as they do on all occa-
sions whether of mirth or of fear men
shouted some for quiet some demanding
that the belligerents sit down and permit
them to see some calling for lights and the
guard

  the fool of an attendant instead of
throwing in the switch rushed first to sepa-
rate what he thought might be no more than
a little argument somebody whether
friend or foe struck him under the ear and
nobody thereafter seemed to know where
the lights might be turned on the uproar
increased partizans sprang up from all
sides in response to the shouts of our
youths and lent impetus to the fray by
climbing over the seats to join in

  your gringos of course called for no
help being imbued with your customary
arrogant conviction that each one of them
could conquer ten foreigners as you term
us in our own country they fought si-
lently-except that they cursed horribly by
the name of god and of the-as they

dealt each blow yet others must have
come to their assistance for no three could
have stood against the mob

  the thing became an international riot

and it gravitated of course down the slope
of the dim passageway till the combatants
surged into the space of the orchestra and
beat each other with the instruments of the
musicians who wretched ones had no
means of escape

  in the meanwhile those who struggled to
get out at the upper end by the door ham-
pered the guardia civil who struggled to get
in so it was not till fifteen minutes had
passed that they finally gained entrance
and then as is always the case when the law
arrives the rioters ducked this way and
that and melted away in the dark and
there remained when light was eventually
restored only those who were incapacitated
for flight

  one of these was your son who lay with a
dark trickle oozing from his fiery hair with
him another gringo a blond youth who be-
longed to a respectably established english
house of the city three of our lads
groaned among the wreckage and-ho-ho
spice was added to the tale when the police-
men extracted from among the wires of the
piano the senhor da sylvestra a man of
substance and position in the city who had
no right to mix himself up with the brawl-
ings of hot-headed youths

   one result of that affair was an ordinance
of the fire guard that all such houses be pro-
vided with at least one exit in the rear in
addition to the door of entry the result
to your son was what was to be expected
they were taken up all of them whom the
policemen caught and thrown into the cala-
bouqo together to reflect upon their foolish-
ness in disturbing the peace

          later in the course of a couple
of days or so there were fines to
be paid before the judge and
much anguished running about
on the part of your harassed consul to get
his countryman the instigator of it all off
with no worse than a wholesome fine

  the youths what with comforting each
other in the lock-up and helping each other
with their hurts-and having acquired a
certain respect for the weight of each others
blows-became friends all except the
da sylvestra for he was by way of be-
ing a pompous man the wits of the cafes


adventure

made sport of his misfortune inventing
many ribald explanations for the manner of
his stuffing into the rear of the piano and
what man of conceit will forgive a hurt to
his dignity

  for the rest all might have been well for
your foolish son for we of the south though
our own customs are different do not hold
it against your gringos that you are an ex-
citable people and become often boisterous
in your behavior unlike the germans and
frenchmen who are more like ourselves
and fall into our customs immediately and
with ease

  the city was prepared to look with toler-
ance upon your fire-head but que louco
the fool it was reported of him that the
first thought he gave expression to in the
calabouqo was to rejoice that nobody had
commenced to fight with pistols and
when asked indignantly whether he thought
that our citizens went to their entertain-
ment armed he said with naive surprize
that he thought surely so and he admitted
with a certain bravado that he carried an
automatic pistol in a special pocket that was
constructed in the rear of all trousers made
in the united states

  senhor it is just little things like these
that rankle a city that is admittedly of
the verge of civilization and which has
passed through a period of wild lawlessness
during its early building may well develop
an extreme sensitiveness about its adherence
to law and order did not the same spirit
rise from time to time among your own
pioneer communities when in their sudden
hysteria of virtue they organized commit-
tees of vigilance to deal more violently with
the breakers of the law than the lawbreakers
themselves you understand the situa-
tion no

  an indication of this was that i found him
a few days later in the cafe dos estrangeiros
seated at a table alone among us it is the
custom when a stranger sits alone for some
one of the residents to approach and request
permission to sit while he takes a small
coffee or a cigaret the while he engages the
stranger in such small conversation as may
come to mind it is a pleasing little cere-
monial indicative of welcome at the hands of
the citizens so it is my observation that
when a man sits alone he has given offense
i laughed as i slid into the chair opposite to
him and signaled to the moqo with my two
fingers crooked

  com permissao senhor i said we
shall drink a little black one together
and observing his glum face i laughed
again and added well my young friend
you are beginning to learn that not all of
these people are your friends eh

  he remained silent for a while sipping
moodily and with a wry face at the bitter
coffee then-

  i dont understand you people he
burst out

  i shrugged

  no i asked is it not yet clear to
you that you have offended these good citi-
zens in some manner

  he remained silent again stabbing at the
thick coffee grounds with his little spoon
after a full minute

  thats just it he complained i have
been engaged in a trifle of a brawl but i do
not see what there is to occasion so much of
a fuss the populace looks at me as if i had
stolen something even those three who
were locked up with me seem to have been
frightened away silence again then a
burst of youthful confidence why in
my home town there would have been a
whole gang of fellows ready to make friends
and my picture would have been in the
local paper

  i was forced to laugh once more

  true i said here we do not give
honor to mere notoriety for its own sake
but you are right to many of your people
it is not given to understand our people
for them it does not matter they work in
somebodys office and they draw a wage
and presently they go home again-or they
stay on and die but you you have ambi-
tions yet you have been here three
months and yet you do not understand that
it is not on account of a little brawling that
people avoid you you do not grasp the
many little little reasons for your offense
and he proceeded immediately to give me
further proof of the fact by forcing upon me
a cigaret out of his own case in politeness
i took and lighted the thing and doubtless i
made as wry a face over it as he over the
bitter coffee a foul tube it was stuffed
with the sweepings of the tobacco factories
and tasting like a mixture of all things that
burn yet he extolled it to the skies with
genuine conviction and for what reason
listen

  a million packages are sold every day
he said and he added as a final proof of
jungle business



excellence made in my own home state
ive brought five thousand with me and

-knows -what i shall do when they are

gone

  this to me a native of brazil where
while our flavors are strong we smoke at
least pure tobacco yet he meant no in-
sult that sense of superiority of all things
that emanated from his own petty corner of
the earth was an instinct with him i rose
and left him 

  my son i said to him if that god
who shares with you that select little spot in
your country where you were born is very
good to you it may be given to you to un-
derstand and learn in the meanwhile
remember when you can live no longer
here in manaos try once your fortune in the
upper rivers before you go back to your
heaven ask for theophilo of the upper
rivers it will be a sufficient passport for
your safe conduct

  and so i came away upon my own busi-
ness which took me on that occasion up the
rio negro and inland into some of the dim
overhung creeks igarapes we call them
which come in above santa isabel word
filtered up to me from time to time about
the doings of the fire-head for it had been
very swiftly noticed that i had shown a
small interest in him and there were men
who worked on the little flat stern-wheel
steamer of the companha navigacione
which came once a month as far as santa
isabel when the river currents allowed who
were anxious to have my favor

  it appears that he perpetrated no particu-
lar enormities except that he drove my
good friend vargas the proprietor of the
hotel to impotent rage by repeating to him
upon all occasions the glory of some hotel
or other in the north which boasted eight
thousand rooms this barrack with in-
timate details of its telegraphs and its ele-
vators and its valets and its cooks of the
european nobility was thorn enough in the
proprietors side but its very immensity
rendered comparison innocuous

  it was when the incurable patriot began
to extol the superior system of the little
hotel in his own home town that vargas at
last with gnashing teeth begged him either
to desist or to go and find some other hotel
where he would have less to criticize
whereupon the young man with an ag-
grieved air capped the crime by apologizing
profusely and saying that he thought the

other would be glad to learn pointers about
how an up-to-date modern hotel was con-
ducted

  what the climax was that finally per-
suaded him i do not know suffice it that
word came to me upoq one of my creeks
that the steamer of the companha had ar-
rived at santa isabel and upon it a gringo
whom the captain would have killed except
that he had given it out that he came to
seek theophilo da costa

  oho said i to myself this mut be
none other than my pelloroxq who with the
very best of intentions has exasperated the
commandante to the point of murder

  and i took two extra men to my bateldo 
and with eight paddles going i sped down to
take charge of this responsibility that i had
invited the steamer was always delayed
some five or six days tied up to the bank at
santa isabel for the only thing that paid
the return journey was the cargo of cas-
tanha which you call brazil nuts the
company had tried desperately for years to
establish a schedule

  but dientro senhor it must be admitted
that we who live in the hot countries have
grown into the habit of taking things easily
and nothing could teach those contractors
of the nut gatherers who lived below the
very belt of the equator that a few days
could make any difference one way or the
other so they straggled in with their car-
goes a day two days or even a week late
and the steamer must needs sit on the mud
by the river bank and await their coming

 sa so i found my young man still
 jfljc cheerfully occupying the cubicle
which they called a cabin and
apparently enjoying the glower-
ing hostility of the captain

  picaro i said to him will you
never learn up here is different to ma-
naos city what have you done this time
has nobody told you that this man is known
as a killer in the rivers

  he had the effrontery to grin

  so the talk ran he replied but the
man laid needless insult upon me

  and he related how the weather being
stifling he had sat down to the midday meal
which was served on the open deck without
his coat which he maintained since he
wore a new silk shirt and a collar would be
considered in his home town formal enough
in the presence of the seven or eight other


adventure

passengers of nondescript appearance who
wore some of them unclean pajamas and
others no shirt at all but only an open coat
over a dingy singlet

  - i exclaimed but this is not

the custom among us a coat of some sort
one must wear even though it be only a rag
man you were naked

how should i know he defended in
any case if the captain thought i was scan-
dalising his ship he should have told me in
private instead he called a slovenly
ter and whispered certain instructions
d had the fellow present me with one of
s own not so very clean white duck uni-
orm coats upon a salver

  name of a saint and what then i
asked quickly

  well he grinned widely again i
accepted it and bowed to him and put it on
-i am learning your customs you see
and then at the next meal i called the
same waiter and whispered to him and had
him present the captain with a pair of
socks

  sanctissimasj i shouted and you
live

  but i was forced to laugh with him for
by the holy ones the man had deserved
the return and knowing that captain i
knew what a tale that would make for the
cafes how my gringo bearded the bad man
on his own ground and suffered no penalty

  the lad begins to strike back when he
feels that he is in the right said i to my-
self here is good metal for the tem-
pering

  but i called an indian to take up his pair
of great leather satchels and i hurried him
away from the boat with speed before i too
should become embroiled with the enraged
captain and i made him welcome to ham-
mock space in my own bateldo

  being late we ate and slept and in the
morning we talked of plans for the fortune
that he was going to wrest out of the wil-
derness

  entdo here we are i said to him
you find yourself at last in the lawless
jungle that you thought was manaos city
for santa isabel as you see is but a tram-
pled landing place for the steamer and an
adobe hut which the owner calls the hotel
and a deserted rubber shed from here up
is our country of the upper rivers where the
law is to him who can make it here you
may live with pistols tied to your thighs in

the uncomfortable manner of your com-
patriots of the central plains you are
now a pioneer

  good said he my fathers were
pioneers here perhaps i shall fit in
manaos where i would have been friends
with everybody i met only hostility
which- he grinned again-may possibly
have been somewhat my own fault but

  oho you have indeed begun to learn i
i said to him and i clapped him on the
shoulder but my young friend let me
tell you this herein the jungle where you
hope to wrest a fortune do not hope to be
friends with anybody at all for everybody
is striving with all his mind and his heart
and his sinew to accomplish the same thing
each in his own way what way have you
in mind to adopt

  let me be accursed if i know said he
and he sat swinging his legs from the
hammock and frowning in thought

  i watching his face and his careless con-
fidence thought that i might use this young
man here where there were few people for
him to insult so i made him a compli-
mentary offer which many a youth of the
city would have given his soul to ac-
cept

  good i said i shall give you em-
ployment working with me till such time as
you know the ropes and then you may
strike out for yourself

  but carramba he refused the chance as
airily as if i had offered him a cigaret

  no said he i thank you friend of
the jungle places where i must look for no
friends i can not take employment for in
my home town in an institute for the teach-
ing of business they taught me an advice for
all young men be your own boss so-
he cast about in his mind-i shall make a
business for myself

  truly the man had a talent for giving
offence yet he had smilingly called me
his friend on top of my warning and i
reflected that it would not be a bad thing
to have a youth with his unconquerable
confidence and energy allied to me in those
upper rivers so instead of leaving him to
his own devices i decided to help him

  bom i said you talk as if many
varieties of business stand cataloged ready
to hand yet business can be made by such
men as are not fools or cowards else how
should we river runners live tell me
jungle business



then what is in your mind about a busi-
ness 

  he showed no hesitation

  - he said in my travel of six

days in that sweating steamer i have ob-
served but one business being carried on-
castanha and that business is conducted
very badly there is room for much im-
provement therefore i shall go into the
brazil nut business

  miravelt i was forced toexclaim he
has put his finger upon it in a single viewing
for twenty years these nut gatherers have
continued in the same haphazard manner
exactly as they did in the old days when the
business was a few bateldo loads so they do
now though the export is sixty thousand
tons this must be an example of-how do
you call it-hustle

  but my young friend you overlook a
matter which is a stumbling block to all
your compatriots this manner of gath-
ering and shipping these nuts has now be-
come established custom it is costumbre
and the man does not live who can in one
lifetime alter costumbre

  his confidence hardened to the usual
stubbornness of one who does not under-
stand the difficulty

  by golly he began ill bet i can

speed up that-

  but i do not waste time any more in ar-
guing with americanos about the rigidity of
established custom among our people in-
stead of trying to convince him i showed
him an easier way a gift of certain informa-
tion which i had

  listen my confident friend i told him
since you speak of nuts there is an alterna-
tive which may with the expenditure of
much hard work and a little money be
developed to great profit in these igara-
pes the creeks that i am having oc-
casion to explore there exists within
workable distance tagua in great quan-
tities

  seeing his face remain blank i explained
further	

  the ivory nut from which in your
country they manufacture buttons and
then send catalogs to our merchants adver-
tizing products of genuine ivory the
creeks are not far indians are available
and friendly for the castanha does not grow
there and so these trader fellows have not
penetrated the condition is ideal my-
self i can not use it since i have other irons

to heat and i can not devote the necessary
time

  i do not wish to let any of those low
trader npen come messing into my water
making trouble with the indians so i

present this business to you my pelloroxo
with it i give my advice out of all my expe-
rience and such help as my time may per-
mit and you shall give me your word
over hand clasp to apportion to me a one-
third share

  his face expanded with eagerness as he
listened and he interrupted with oaths of
the gum and the cripesto attest that
the folks back in the insufferable home town
of his would surely call this a god-given
opportunity to get into a new business
and to be ones own boss-which things
were apparently the religion of that town
but his enthusiasm faded again as he said
with mournfulness

  sure sounds like the goods but a new
business needs capital and i have but three
hundred dollars

  ouve the listen to him i shouted
and smote him on the back you are
here a pioneer i have told you not
money but bowels-and a little sense-
does a man need to make a business in a
pioneer country three hundred dollars is
nearly three thousand milreis and with the
half of that you can have built a bateldo like
mine and fill it up with trade goods enough
for a year

  his eyes opened witri that same look of
wonder that had so impressed me at our
first meeting in manaos city and-

  gee he said with three hundred dol-
lars back home i couldnt-

  but i clapped my hand over his mouth
before he could tell me about his home town

  listen my friend i told him i will
instruct you in the rules for making business
in our rivers they are three the first
is make friends with the indians by learn-
ing and respecting their customs and super-
stitions-for they represent your labor
prate not to them about the superior man-
ner of conduct in your accursed home town
when they say in such a manner are we
accustomed to do this thing say to them
good let us then do it all together and
with speed

  the second is make friends with the
ipages the witch doctors for they control
your labor

  and the third is never lie to either


adventure

for the former will believe your word but
once and the latter will surely find you
out

  good said he those are simple

  but i still added a warning

  simple to learn but not so easy to
remember in all ones dealings amigo
for of all the men who trade these upper
rivers there is perhaps but one other than
myself who adheres to them-which is why
they remain petty traders three simple
rules yet those fellows do not heed them
and for you my fire-head i will add a
fourth forget that petty townlef which
you share with your god in the center
state of america and concede that whole
men are born also in the states of the east
and of the west ay and even in some of
the states of america of the south

  he grinned at me again

  so i am beginning to find out my friend
of the jungle places he said

  good said i you have learned
much come then let us go to the
steamer and purchase from the traveling
agent of the house of araujo company such
trade goods as will be needful for this busi-
ness in the back creeks

so we went together and as
we stood on the long plank that
connected the steamer with the
less moist of themud of the ad-
joining bank the captain swelling at the
neck shouted at us from the upper deck

  what is that man that you bring with
you you theophilo sheltering him under
the cover of your name to insult me on my
own ship

  i was about to reply as the man deserved
when this fire-head took the words upon
himself and shouted back

  this is an up-river man mio capitdo by
name pelloroxo one who shelters under
no mans name but his own

  celestes i muttered fool-head
the man is ripe for quarrel be ready to
jump into the river

  but the captain was clearly taken aback
by this boldness and he must surely have
reflected quickly that this mans reputation
was to carry a pistol in that specially con-
structed pocket of his even in manaos
city so instead of making any hostile
move he but grumbled and retreated into
his wheel house i breathed again at the
passing of the trouble and we went on into

the ship to the araujo man and i advised
him in the selection of such goods as would
be most acceptable to the indians of the

igarapes

  knives and machetes and ax heads and
fish hooks and small mirrors and salt all
such things as the indians most desire
and i told him that i would make out a
list for him of their values in terms of trade
for since the indians understood nothing of
cost it was necessary for him to know how
much labor could be bought for each
article

  and i added for his own feeding quinin
and medicines and rice and great slabs of
dried pirarucu fish and lard to be used
when the wild game should fall short on
the top of which he demanded potatoes
but i told him

  you have seen your last leathery potato
and your last musty vegetable on this river
steamer from now on you will eat the
manihot yam of the indians

  he made a face but said nothing i
laughed and reminded him with gusto
wait my young pioneer till it shall be
your fate-as comes to all of us river men-
to eat the stinking pirarucu

  and then i selected for him a rifle of the
winchester  with five hundred cartridges
which have become so standard in our
rivers that they pass for currency and i
advised him further that while it was
against the law since there was no law in
our jungles the best present that could be
made to a chief in the back creeks would be
a muzzle-loading gun of one barrel with
black powder and shot for its use

  all the things that would be necessary for
his subsistence in the jungle i selected for
him and in all things he submitted to my
judgment and we made a great pile of the
goods upon the deck and i checked over
the list to see that nothing was forgotten
and said to him then

  basta it is finished you are outfitted
now with all that any man needs in our
back creeks

  but he demurred still

  will it not be necessary amigo to carry
a pistol in those back creeks

  the automatic pistol that you have will
suffice i told him

  but he replied

  i have no pistol my good friend for
since they found such fault with me in
manaos and made such a fuss about the
jungle business



carrying of a pistol i gave it to another
gringo who was traveling back north
what is that i exclaimed what do
you tell me do you mean to say that
when you answered back to that captain
you had no pistol in your back pocket
his grin was that of an infant without
sense or care

  nary gun said he but how was he
to know that

  celestes i grumbled a fool like you
needs two pistols at the least

  so we bought them great pistols of
colt which are as good currency as the
rifles of winchester and we called indians
and conveyed the whole mass into the aged
rubber shed where i set a man of my own
to watch over it

  now i said all that you need is a
bateldo and you are established but that
will take some little time to be built

  but in this matter we were fortunate
with all that pile of goods in the rubber
shed it was evident to all the world that a
boat would be needed to carry it in and
so in the course of a day or so there came to
me a padrao of nut gatherers who told me
that his partner had been bitten by a jara-
raca while dipping his hand foolishly to
draw water and that his bogt was therefore
for sale

  so we went to look it over and found a
very satisfactory craft a bateldo much like
my own stoutly built of hand-hewn planks
of mahogany some ten meters in length
having fie stern half-covered over with a
funnel-shaped roof of palm thatch to afford
dry accommodation for goods and gear and
hammock room for the owner amidships a
small deck upon which he might recline
while directing the craft and the forward
part half-decked with slats of split cane
whereon the paddle men would squat three
to each side

  the rogue of a padrao immediately asked
a gringo price but the pelloroxo told him
swiftly

  name of a- what is this i am

an up-river man and the partner of theo-
philo

  so the fellow accepted the half and was
well satisfied as was i also for my own
business demanded my time and i had
been wondering how this lad with no experi-
ence would be able to make his first ap-
proaches to the up-creek indians without
some guidance now i would be able to

take him up with me and introduce him into

the business personally

  he would need only an interpreter who
would be his mouth until such time as he
could master sufficient of the geral-which
is a very simple language and easily learned
-and a temporary paddle crew whom
he would dismiss after having established
friendly relations with the local indians

  so i found for him a piloto a reliable man
who knew something of the management of
a bateldo in the currents and who could also
cook a little in the batelero style and hav-
ing spent a long day we slept he for the
first time in his own bateldo and as pleased
as an infant with a new toy i satisfied
that a profitable day had been spent and
that nothing had been omitted on the
very morrow we would start

  a propitious morning for nothing oc-
curred to occasion delay-which among us
of the south is unusual the pelloroxo ap-
peared in the formal americano dress for the
trip into the wilderness a shirt of khaki
open at the neck breeches of cord high
yellow boots all complete and all new
with one of his new pistols hanging at his
hip from a loose belt

  mira que magnificol i congratulated
him as i laughed and the bystanders who
had gathered to see us off murmered appro-
bation

  collectors of the castanha and their
padraos they were with several ox-faced
indians and they had never seen such mag-
nificence of fashion old tio romeiro a
batelero of forty years standing in the upper
rivers spat his chew of ipadu leaf upon the
prow of the new boat for luck and said

  let be let him persevere till he
reaches the creeks and the indians will
surely think that he is a very great chief
fr never have they seen such a white man
and within that time he will have learned
from experience that breeches are good
when one rides upon a horse and when one
stands upright but for all other purposes in
the world they bind at the knee where they
sweat and itch like the very cane lice them-
selves

  but he laughed in turn and told me

  por deus these are what i purchased at
great expense in my home town at the ad-
vice of the camp-goods dealer who told me
that such would be the appropriate costume
for manaos city so wear them now i
must


adventure

what need to relate our petty
travel nothing of note oc-
curred in three days we reached
the igarape marauia and passing 
into it out of the great river were lost imme-
diately in another world for while the
rio negro at that point is a sea of some four
miles wide interspersed with islands this
igarape is suddenly a narrow tunnel winding
for fifty miles into the very heart of the
jungle sluggish and dark it is overhung
with great trees which send aerial roots and
lianas as thick as a mans body to seek foot-
hold in the lushy ground which never dries
even in the dry season

  and while the great black river is silent
and empty of all life here one plunges into
all the sounds of the jungle monkeys and
parrots which one knows to be disporting
themselves in the sunlit green far above but
which one never sees the hiss of insects that
pass like bullets the creaking talk of the
trees now and then a long call which one
may identify as the cry of one of the larger
beasts and now and then again a wild cry
which in spite of twenty years experience
one can not place at all i looked back from
my bateldo and called to pelloroxo

  be afraid my gringito for from now
on you do not see the sun till you come out
again with a cargo

  but he laughed

  yourself have told me that i am a pio-
neer as were my fathers why then should
i be afraid

  and he sang as he sat on the thatch roof
of his cabin songs of atrocious tempo and
the most lugubrious of sentiment but in
his voice was the careless spirit of his fore-
fathers the spirit that drove them ever to
seek out and take delight in the new places

  in a couple of days we arrived into the
country where i had discovered the tagua
nuts and there i summoned a council of
the jungle chiefs and caused the pelloroxo to
stand before them as my friend who would
deal with them even as i had dealt after
which i was compelled to leave him to his
own devices to stand or fall according to
the limitations of his own wit and courage
and his ability to absorb the many advices
that i gave him for my own business de-
manded that i return out to the big river
and journey yet three days farther up

  it was with some misgiving that i went
for he was new and much in need of experi-
ence yet since he would have only in-

dians to deal with who are up there un-
spoiled and well-meaning though lazy by
heredity and inclination i had a certain
confidence but as for him carramba con-
fidence was the one thing that he lacked
least ever since his first arrival in manaos
so i wished him d buena dicha the best of
luck and went

five months passed i think-
ing often of this so venturesome
gringo and wondering how he
was progressing in his capacity
of his own boss in our joint new busi-
ness till i was able to journey again to
santa isabel and made a point of going up
our igarape on a tour of inspection

  paddling and poling up the dark passage
i began to be filled with dismay at seeing no
signs of a healthy traffic lianas cut and
water passages cleared and all the marks
that canoe traffic will leave the igarape
was empty and deserted even more so it
seemed to me than before when a few
indians passed occasionally to santa isabel
to exchange feathers for goods

  but it turned out that i was needlessly
alarmed as i began to reach into the
tagua district on the second day signs of
industry became apparent the first was
a far chopping in the forest

  hau one makes a canoe grunted my
paddle men

  presently we came upon a naked indian
in a dugout canoe with a new machete stuck
through a thong at the back of his waist
him i ordered to come near and account for
his possession he came readily enough
without fear and said that he worked for
the white man gathering the fruit of the
tagua tree for some strange purpose of the
white mans and that the white man was
different from all other people in that he
paid in advance his machete therefore
had been come by honestly for he would
fulfil his promise and collect three canoes
full of fruit

  que louco said i to myself what a
fool system is this how can one make
contract with indians who do not love work

  yet just round the bend we came upon
a small clearing and a palm leaf shelter by
the creek edge under which a pile of nuts
was accumulating other such shelters
were passed and more indians and pres-
ently toward the end of the day came the
camp of the white man himself
jungle business



  a house no less built of split palm
trunks and interlaced with lianas close
enough to keep out the vampire bats a
luxurious affair of two rooms all perched
upon stilts a good two meters clear of flood
water a veritable hacienda

  the pelloroxo descended upon me with
loud cries and many oaths and dragged me
in immediately to eat for his code of hospi-
tality was that a friend must be first of all
fed manatee steak it was well prepared
and tasty the good effect of which he would
have spoiled by thrusting upon me one of
his pernicious cigarets

  i am conserving them with jealous care
he assured me

  but i pushed the foul paper aside and
rolled one for myself of pure tobacco in a
strip of miripapo bark

  now tell me all things i said but
first of all why in the name of all the saints
you have not been sending your nuts down
to santa isabel to ship you have plenty
enough already this is a very center of
unexpected industry

  he threw out his hands

  my friend said he our business is
held up by the transportation problem i
need here a fleet the nuts you see are
only a part for i have been voyaging up and
down stream and into all the little side
creeks and we have now many little sheds
filling steadily up with nuts

  miracle i grunted but with skepti-
cism for i knew those indians but he
was eager to proceed

  true at first there was difficulty he
admitted in answer to my tone for
these indians have no desire to labor and
they were skeptical for some of them had
been down to the big river where they had
fallen in with the traders and there was a
conviction among them that they would be
paid either not at all or cheated in the
amount till i hit upon the plan of paying
in advance-and now we have the indians
of twenty-one villages working busily for us
i grunted again

  they may work said i or rather
promise to work while you dangle a knife
or a machete before their eyes but how
busily they will continue to work after you
have gone is another question

  no my good friend you are mistaken
he insisted against my twenty years of ex-
perience they will work and produce
for i have taken the business precaution of

insuring our business already we have
many more tons of nuts than we can send
down what use in sending a bateldo load
or two and a few canoes which will serve
only to attract trader people here before
we are well established no i will not
begin to ship until my fleet is ready
cremento a fleet you talk of and in-
surance how do you propose to collect a
fleet i demanded

  his grin flashed out i could see that he
was pleased with himself so much so that
he expended another of his precious cigarets

  high finance he exulted these in-
dians as you know will do anything rather
than settle down to the three months labor
of hewing a canoe out of a tree trunk and
they struggle along with any ancient leaky
thing till it positively falls apart-and then
they will bind it up with vines and use it
half full of water

  so i conceived the idea of paying them
for building new canoes for themselves an
ax head to each man who would immediately
put it to use in hewing out a canoe with the
stipulation only that the canoe be of seven
meters in length or more and that the man
fill it up three times with nuts i tell you
my friend presently we shall be able to
despatch a fleet of a hundred ships and in
four trips we can collect in the old rubber
shed at santa isabel a cargo sufficient to
charter the whole available space in the
steamer and then those castanha gatherers
will come to us begging with bribes in their

hands-

  but i cut his rhapsody short

  hm fine i said with sarcasm a
wonderful dream-if these indians were peo-
ple with whom you could make a contract
and who could be compelled to hold to their
agreements but they will shortly weary

of labor and will make excuses and-

  but he in turn interrupted me

  no my friend they will not

  psha said i i know these indians for
twenty years of experience you can not
tell me any new thing about them

  and he grinning again

  no new thing indeed but i have done
what you yourself advised i have learned
their customs and their beliefs and have
made friends above all things with the
ipage-who is my insurance in this way
it was the old chief upanha is old and the
second chief was an enlightened savage
he had been to santa isabel often and had


adventure

worked rubber in the old days and he was
ambitious to gain the leadership he used
to be my chief opponent in persuading the
others that the white men never paid what
they promised

  now the ipage is friendly to the old
chief who gives him honor and believes in
his wizardries so presently when a big
fever came the second chief aimed to under-
mine the ipages power by telling all the
people that his witchcraft was worthless as
a cure that men either died of fevers or got
well of themselves and that i the white
man would surely back him up in the
knowledge that he had learned from the
white men

  icpor dios the decision of a dynasty
seemed to be thrust thus suddenly upon my
shoulders so i called the ipage quietly and
gave him quinin to make witchcraft with
and proclaimed that i for one surely be-
lieved in his witchcraft to effect a cure for
the fever

  so the wizard triumphed and the exist-
ing dynasty continued and the pretender
to the throne died-i do not know of what
and the ipage is now my stout ally and his
threat is that those indians who take the
white mans pay and do not deliver their
contract in full and with speed to the white
man who gives honor where honor is due
will be fearfully bewitched by him so my
friend have no fear we are well insured
they will deliver

  basta it was sufficient i was convinced
and i took credit to myself that i had
rightly judged this young fire-heads
shrewdness and energy and i gave credit
also to him i smote him joyfully on the
back and told him with some complacence

  my son you have learned well the lesson
which i told you having forgotten your
insufferable home town and its useless cus-
toms you have learned the customs of the
upper rivers and have been enabled thus to
do a great work in organizing the beginnings
of a very profitable business now tell me
was i not right

  the eyes of that young ruffian laughed
at me with the spirit of the very -- in
them

  you were right in all things he said
except that in that institute which taught
business in my home town they taught me
that the first most important principle upon
which a business could be built was-or-
ganization

  diabo the maldiqa what can one say to
such a fellow except curse him while he
laughs which i did very properly and
he but laughed the more but i was able
to tell him

  none the less my so confident friend
you have learned the lesson that you must
work with the customs of the people instead
of trying to tell them how much better are
your own

  to which he with all humility agreed
i stayed with him for two days and in his
bateldo we cruised into the upper reaches
of the creek where i saw for myself how his
system of advance payments with the in-
surance of the ipages witchcraft to back up
his contracts was working out and car-
ramba it was like a system of loans con-
ducted by a bank never have i seen so
much industry in the upper rivers

  i gave him congratulations and i left him
this time with no uneasiness in my mind
the man had learned and was established
remained now only the problem of securing
a market his last words to me shouted
after my bateldo as it was turning the first
bend of the creek were

  why not go on down to manaos and
make a contract with some export house to
purchase our product for we can very
shortly now guarantee a fixed quantity
every month and that institute in my
home town taught me that the second most
important principle upon which a business
can be conducted is-guaranteed delivery
i made the sign with the palm of the hand
against the thigh and the throat which
signifies among us that misfortune is due
to him who brags and went on down to
santa isabel but i thought much over his
suggestion and truly it seemed good to me
to make some sort of an agreement with
some exporting house whereby we might
gain some advantage in return for a steady
delivery with each month

  so the monthly steamer being there i
took passage and went and in manaos i
found very favorable reception for the price
of tagua was standing at two and a half
milreis per kilo and not much was coming
in from the other rivers yet the arrange
ments took up some time and the steamer
went up again and returned before i was
ready to go-and then it was delayed while
its decrepit engine indulged in one of its
periodical breakdowns so that it went on
into two months before i was able to travel
jungle business

i

up our igarape again this time with a
pleasurable anticipation

  db but men deus as i traveled i
ii met with a disquiet much greater
than on my first trip for at the
first of the palm leaf sheds i
found two strange batelaos tied up to the
bank half full of nuts while the shed was
empty their masters were away in the
woods the crews told me but i knew their
names gross fellows both with a reputa-
tion for high handedness and a browbeating
of the trader folk and bateleros who congre-
gated at santa isabel

 the crew man were sullen and would tell
me only that their masters had bought the
nuts from the indians who collected at that
point and that they were arranging now for
more laborers to work for them

  diabo said i to myself what villainy
is this has the pelloroxo also been brow-
beaten by their evil reputation to permit
this robbery or is he perhaps dead up
there in the jungle

  so i passed on with anxiety but indians
in a new canoe whom i met farther up told
me that the white man lived and was well
so i told my paddle men to dip deep and
strong so that i might reach the camp by
the same evening and receive his explana-
tion from himself

  his joy to see me was as great as his relief
and he recounted to me immediately how
those two had sneaked up our creek and
the first that he had known about it was
when he received a machete the same that
he had given the indian down there as pay-
ment for his labor he did not blame the
indian for those trader men had told him
that if he returned the payment he would
be free of his contract and that they would
give him another machete and something
more besides but what was he to do about
those two men he did not know till i should
return and he had been waiting for me
now this full month while they stole our
nuts i looked at him with amazement and
considerable disappointment

  sangue deus i growled what do
you expect to do in such a case call for a
policeman to protect you

  i dont know he answered with a grave
face i waited for your coming to find out
what was the proper procedure according
to the custom of the upper rivers

  proper procedure i said with sarcasm

carramba you come into our peaceful cities
carrying a pistol engaging in rioting and
comporting yourself after the manner of
your wild west beyond the borders of
civilization and now that you are here
in pioneer country beyond our borders of
law you became tame and wait to inquire
what is the proper procedure of law dien-
tro i will show you what is my custom i
shall go down to those two ruffians and shall
tell them that i theophilo am interested
in this business and basta they will apolo-
gize and withdraw

  but he bit upon his lip and swallowed my
scorn

  no he insisted with a set face if i
am to conduct a business in these upper
rivers i must attend to this matter myself
i but wanted to know what might be done
without antagonizing the whole of ama-
zonas let us say no more but come in
and eat

  so he took me into his stilt house and
would say no more on the subject but he
called his piloto and gave orders that the
bateldo crew be prepared for an early start
the next morning and he remained in a
silent mood till morning came with the
first screaming of the parrots he was up and
shouting for his paddle men to jump and go
and he would have gone alone with his
silence and his set face but i insisted on
accompanying him for i know those two
men to be cunning as well as treacherous

  they were lolling on the bank beside their
batelaos when we arrived for it was the
siesta hour the one a heavy set man of
the same height as the pelloroxo but getting
stout from easy living and the other
equally tall but as lean and stringy as the
first was stout though both their faces were
well matched in a furtive sort of truculence

  upon seeing our bateldo come round the
bend they sprang to their feet cursing with
surprize for they had flaunted their inso-
lence so long in security that this visit was
very unexpected indeed the stout one
made as if to run to his bateldo but the other
held him by the arm and drew him to him-
self and they stood together whispering

  we swung into the bank and the pel-
loroxo sprang out with alacrity

  have a care i warned him as i fol-
lowed for both these fellows have the
reputation of carrying weapons not in open
view like yours but concealed

  but he paying no attention to me stalked


adventure

close and addressed them in a tone of easy
conversation

  do you two misborn brigands fight with
pistols or with knives or how

  this bluntness from one whom they had
been regarding as a man easy to rob took
them aback but the lean one quickly re-
covered his surly self-possession and ad-
dressed himself to me

  have you theophilo any interest with
this gringo or with his fate

  it was a leading question and i knew
that upon my answer would depend their
action but my mind was quickly made up

  no i said he handles his own affair
by himself

  the pelloroxo while watching the others
like a jaguar still found time to flash a
glance at me and to murmur thanks
amigo during which interval the other
two looked at one another and laughed as if
some joke were about to befall then the
leaner of the two composed his features to
that expression of ferocity which fellows of
his class employ for the purpose of intimi-
dation

  then said he with contempt we do
not care how we fight or when

he delivered it as an ultimatum
and stood as if expecting some
argument in reply but this
gringo of mine was ever restless
for action rather then talk hardly were
the words out of the fellows mouth when the
pelloroxo rushed at him with the sudden-
ness of a peccary boar with his fist he hit
him once underneath the eye so that the
blood spurted under the blow again be-
fore the man could recover his balance and
while the scream of rage was yet in his
throat he hit him with the other fist a
terrible blow in the belly so that the scream
was choked to a groan and the man leaned
forward with eyes turning back in his head
and hands clutching at his middle a third
time with incredible speed he struck him
upon the ear as he thus staggered and com-
pleted his fall down the slope of the bank
into the creek

  brava i shouted with excitement and
as i shouted a pistol sounded and i heard
the ball hum and clatter the next instant
in the jungle beyond the creek thanking
the holy saints in the same breath for that
pistol shooting was an inaccurate sport at
best i turned my head and saw the other

fellow running to shelter behind a tree and
tinning to shoot again as he ran

  even as i threw myself upon the ground
i saw the example of your national pistol
play as swiftly as do your vaqueros inthe
motion pictures the pelloroxo snatched his
pistol from the holster which hung at his
loose belt of cartridges and fired without
raising to aim the mans arm flew away
and upward from his side the pistol
dropped from his hand he screamed once
and lurched up against his tree where he
supported himself like one drunk and like
a drunkard began to grow weak at the knees
and sag to the ground

  then pelloroxo turned with ready pistol
to attend once more to the other whom he
had knocked into the creek but that blow
upon the ear coming in addition to the
terrible assault upon his stomach had
rendered him unconscious he lay in the
water inert while the indians from the
batelaos chattered in affright and pointed
at the swirl and splash of the black water
all round him

  mercy of- i cried the piranha

and i rushed to haul the wretched man
forth shouting upon the indians to
help

  by the fellows great good fortune this
affair had taken only seconds to accomplish
had it been a protracted battle his plight
would have been a pitiable one as it was
a veritable school of those ferocious fishes
must have been nearby when he fell for he
bled from half a dozen places already on his
unprotected hands and face clean round
holes as big as a vest button they were
showing that his luck was good again in
that they had been young fish

  by this time the indians had found their
wits and were ready to help already a
couple of them were chewing great wads of
the tamaquare leaf to apply as dressing so
i left them to bind him up as best they
might and turned once more to look for my
friend he was leaning over the other
fellow shaking him by the shoulder

  he is not hurt he said to me with dis-
gust i shot him only in the forearm

  and forthwith by kicking him vigorously
on the nether pants he forced the man to
his feet and so held him clutching at his
arm and scowling

  now he ordered tell your indians
immediately to unload those nuts back into
my shed here make speed and he
jungle business



thrust him toward his bateldo and pointed
him to his work with the pistol

  miravel i said this is the first good
thing that i have seen come out of that
home town of yours-the miraculous pistol
play of you americanos

  at that he laughed at me with loud
merriment

  my friend said he in my home
town there is very probably no man who
has ever fired a pistol in his life-as neither
did i before i came here

  but-but name of a saint i began

  but he interrupted me jeering

  but-but am i not learning how to
conduct a business here beyond the borders
of the law twice have i sent down to
santa isabel to the steamer and purchased
i do not know how many kilos of cartridges
i have been practising the ways of your
amazonas my friend i have been prac-
tising yet i will tell you- he laughed
again-i aimed to hit that man anywhere
between his belt and his hat but it is good
for my reputation that he does not know
that

  carramba rest on that reputation said
i the tale will spread you will never
have to shoot again

  he shrugged and turned to see that his
orders about the nuts were being carried
out then he beckoned to an indian who
stood watching all these things with a scared
countenance the man came in answer to
the summons and at five paces distance
prostrated himself upon the ground with his
face between his folded hands the pel-
loroxo spoke to him sternly in the geral
tutua descendant of a black spider-
monkey you are a fool you will return
immediately to these men who are half
white their machete and you will come to-
morrow to my place and will receive again
that which i gave you-for which you will
now deliver four canoe-loads of nuts

  the man raised himself and laying his
crossed fingers against his forehead an-
swered 

  what my white chief says will be only

o	kariwa those men gave me no machete
they only said they would give

  the pelloroxo threw back his head and
laughed with much enjoyment

  good said he that tale will spread
let them rest on that reputation then
to the indian go and take an offering
with you to the ipage that he may remove

his curse from you and to me amigo
we have time to smoke a cigaret while we
watch these little thieves unload

   but i left him to enjoy his tube of refuse
and busied myself with seeing that the last
of our nuts was well and truly delivered out
of the bottoms of those batddos at last
it was finished and the men stood denuded
of their stolen plunder and sullenly sub-
missive pitiable to look at the one with
his arm rudely bandaged and the other un-
recognizable through the poultices of chewed
leaf where the fish had taken pieces out of
him the pelloroxo stood smiling at them
with a hard mouth then he gave them
their orders

   listen you two you will go from here
quickly and you will remember for your
selves and tell it also to all the rest of your
kind that i pelloroxo the up-river man
have drawn a line across the mouth of this
igarape to mark it as my water that is all
and it is easy to remember now go

   they gave no argument but climbed into
their bateldos scowling and silent the in-
dians pushed off without the customary
chant and in less than a minute the dimness
beyond the next bend had swallowed them
i laid my hand on my partners shoulder

   amigo said i that was well done
an improvement even on our custom and
for some of those things that i said yester-
day when i came i give you my apology
he grinned

   they are forgotten good friend of the
upper jungle said he have a cigaret

i did not go back with him to
his camp it was quite clear to
me that he had well absorbed all
the knowledge necessary for the
conducting of an up-river mans business-
at all events in the jungle santa isabel
would be another problem for there i could
forsee conflict with men not so simple and
well-meaning as indians of the back creeks

 but there was growing in me a very satis-
fying confidence in this pelloroxo since he
had begun to understand that custom was a
thing that people adhered to slavishly
whether in our country or in his

  so i went back from that place and up
to my own water to attend to my business
once again with an easy mind free of mis-
giving his parting word to me was

   if you listen carefully from up your
creek you will hear the howl that those


adventure

trader men raise when i grab all the avail-
able cargo space on that river steamer with
our first shipment listen well for the fleet
is almost ready

  which promise he kept within the month
with a hundred and seventeen canoes he
descended one day upon santa isabel and
piled his cargo into the old rubber shed
and nobody knew anything about his prepa-
rations for the port between steamer visits
is but an empty landing stage and nobody
is there but the half-breed with his family
who keeps the adobe hut which he magnifi-
cently calls the hotel

  the pelloroxo wasted no time but made
the shed his home like a true rivernman by
linging his hammock between two posts
and quickly despatched his fleet to bring
down another load six cargoes he brought
in all and when the steamer finally wheezed
up to the landing stage he sat ready he
went on board and greeted the captain

  hola mio capitao a quick return
voyage for you this time for i have a cargo
all prepared for you

  the captain was not one to forget he
offered no open hostility but he growled
that he would carry no cargo for the gringo
the latter laughed easily

  but surely my commandante i have
been on the river now for many months and
i have learned many of the river ways i
know the rules of the companha you must
take the first cargo that comes

  as indeed was the fact for there used
to be much wrangling and not a little blood
letting among those castanha gatherers over
whose cargo should be given preference
when the boat was full on one occasion
between the lot of them they contrived in
their rioting to set fire to the boat so the
companha instituted a rule of first come
first served-and saved incidentally many
days delay thereby though as i have said
delay was plenty enough for nothing could
take away from those indolent fellows the
hope that cargo space would not still be
available after four or five days

  the rule of course was absolute and the
captain was compelled to recognize it he
glowered at the complacent gringo for a mo-
ment and then thought better of it and
shrugged he admitted the rule and said
that bom he would be ready to begin load-
ing cargo as soon as he should have done
this thing and that thing connected with
the management of his ship but his eyes

roved far up the stretches of the river and
down again as he spoke the pelloroxo
laughed again in truth tact was one thing
that he very certainly had not learned he
might have gained his point with more
circumspection but he told the captain

  no no mio capitao i am no longer so
much of a fool as i used to be i know very
well that if a single batelao should come
alongside in the interval you would proceed
to unload that one and then another and
then any others that might keep arriving
and you would claim that you took them
in rotation by no means am i such a fool
no you will give me just one tally clerk
and my own indians will load into your
hold

  at this all the ferocity of the captains
nature blazed forth and for a long half
minute-so the araujo agent who witnessed
it told me-he thought that violence would
ensue and he made for the shelter of his
cabin storeroom but it turned out as i had
prophesied the captain had very evi-
dently heard the tale of that shooting-
doubtless exaggerated in order that the
tellers own honor might not be lowered
so his rage passed no farther than his eyes
the fire died in them and he covered their
confusion with the lids then he shrugged
and turned to spit over the rail that
was all

  i thank you mio capitaosaid the pel-
loroxo and he went to the lower deck and
gave his orders to the tally clerk

  high-handed no doubt but as he told
me himself later it was urgently necessary
for his canoe men had told him as long as
two days back that one of the casmnha
padraos was waiting at his sitio but half a
days journey up river with three batelaos
and some dozen canoes taking things easy
till he might come down and meet all his
friends for the pleasant monthly carouse

  and within the same day he came and
on his heels others began to drift in from up-
river and down-river with their batelaos and
canoes and the howl of dismay which went
up when they found that all the available
cargo space was taken was an ational calam-
ity they appealed to the captain to give
them at least the half of the space to
apportion it out according to each mans
offering and they suggested absurdly that
their own men would unload the cargo that
was already stowed without expense or
delay
jungle business



  but that was out of the question of
course much as the captain would have
liked to favor them against the gringo who
had so cheerfully flouted him he dared not
openly break the rule so the discomfited
castanha traders stood about in groups and
grumbled and asked each other what might
be done in the matter the answer of
course was nothing they had come late
as usual and he who had come first with
his business had been first served

  what is the usual outcome in such a situ-
ation in a crowd of some forty or fifty
rough fellows of no very great intelligence
it is inevitable that anger should turn
against the foreigner somebody started
a murmur and it was not long before the
general grumble was against the accursed
gringo who had outmaneuvered them

  somebody started the suggestion and it
was a matter of only a few minutes before
there was a concerted move to go and inter-
view this gringo the thing was very nearly
ready to become a mob it remained only
for somebody to start the suggestion about
what to do with the gringo and that sug-
gestion would devolve naturally out of the
heated words which would be exchanged at
that interview so the crowd with much
loud talking moved toward the old rubber
shed

  they found the gringo swinging in his
hammock and kicking his heels they stood
about hesitant waiting for somebody to
begin that argument the gringo looked
at them never once he was deeply en-
grossed in playing with his pistol rolling
it in a curious manner round his finger
through the trigger guard so that the butt
swung into the palm of his hand with a soft
and satisfactory slap

  he spoke no word to the crowd and no
man in the crowd quite liked to start speak-
ing to him for the national shooting pro-
pensity of you americanos was well known
to all of them and the story of the shooting
of that particular pistol had very whole-
somely spread it followed thus that there
was no argument of heated words there-
fore nobody started the suggestion of what
to do with the gringo the crowd never
became a mob at all instead it went softly
away to attend to other business

  but the enmity of the thing remained
for this i did not blame the pelloroxo this
time it was no fault of his forcing that
home town annoyance down the throats of

our people it was but the natural penalty
that the foreigner must always pay for his
cleverness none the less he had very
thoroughly antagonized the whole of our
up-river community a most unfortunate
thing when one wishes to conduct a business
in that community

  i was much perturbed when i heard of it
but diabo que facer there was nothing
that could be done about the thing it
seemed to be his fate to antagonize people
but it is my observation that business is
antagonism and it takes much skill to con-
duct a business and not make enemies

  and by the very-s ill luck just when

the business was starting to stand on its
feet the effect of all these antagonisms ac-
cumulated upon our pelloroxo all in a heap
his very first success was the invitation
that drew the most powerful opposition
upon himself

  that shipment upon its arrival in
manaos created a stir tagua high-grade
and in quantity that called for attention
for no other was coming in from the rio
negro side at all and the price was high
if the stuff could be collected by the ship-
load there was money to be made so
reasoned the merchants of the town being
entirely ignorant of the astute organization
that lay behind that load

  an old enemy weighted the matter in his
mind and decided to take action no other
than da sylvestra the pompous fellow who
had got mixed up in that theater riot here
was a chance to invest some money to the
purpose of making a profit and paying off
a debt in a very pleasant manner so on the
very next return steamer he came up to
santa isabel himself

nearly a month had passed
and the pelloroxo was of course
waiting with his rubber shed full
of tagua the castanha men
should have learned their lesson by this
time but it takes more than one lesson to
teach a man the value of time and even
then having learned that value to know
how to speed up his little organization of
jungle workers who had been dilatory all
their fives only a few of them therefore
were ready room enough in the steamers
hold for all

  the pelloroxo stepped on board to go
through the formality of arranging for his
loading but the captain grinned a surly


adventure

reply to his greeting and referred him to
da sylvestra that gentleman lounged in
a hammock strung from cabin to deck rail
so that all who passed had to stoop under
his ropes he smoked a good cigar and
lifted one eyelid at the gringo who stated
civilly enough that the captain had passed
him on to talk about the shipment of his
goods but da sylvestra threw out his
hands palms uppermost and smiled as he
fired his shot

  i am desolate said he but i have
chartered the entire space for the return
trip for my business

  so said the pelloroxo wondering
swiftly what this move might mean you
are going into the castanha business

  but no said the other into tagua
here was the direct challenge the pel-
loroxo rose to it immediately

  i am not selling my tagua to you said
he and there is no other

  da sylvestra shrugged

  there is tagua in the back creeks and
experienced nut gatherers are here in
plenty

  so that was the plan the pelloroxo
understood now but he was in a position
to grin as he replied

  true senhor there is tagua in my water
my water extends back for fifty miles into
the jungle how many indians live in its
back reaches i do not know for i have-
never had time to explore but four hun-
dred indians under their chiefs and ipages
who are my friends work for me believe
me then when i tell you senhor da
sylvestra these expert nut gatherers of
santa isabel will not enter into a war with
my indians

  he waited to let the reflection soak in for
a few moments and then added

  you are a business man senhor there-
fore i will make you a business offer i will
buy your charter from you for the half of
what you paid for it

  with that he left him and came away to
his own bateldo he spoke his insulting offer
boldly but no sooner was he away than he
sent swift canoes to carry messages one to
the ipage at his camp and one to me then
he sat down to make such preparations as
he might and to wait

  da sylvestra was left to gnash upon the
end of his cigar and to exercise his wits for
the saving of his charter money he sent
for such of the nut padrdos as were there to

consult with them but they shrugged and
threw out their hands

he is a bad man that gringo they
said and he has well trained his indians

by some -s means of his own it is

true what he says they will surely fight for
him as ours-curses upon them-will not

  so da sylvestra thought angrily some
more and then said cunningly

  born the man is your enemy as well as
mine you know what may be done here
and what may not but i tell you this and
let it be known to all your friends who
arrive that i will pay the manaos price
two and a half milreis per kilo for tagua
delivered here at santa isabel

  that was a cunning trick and a bribe
indeed to urge those fellows to desperate
measures for the best that they could get
for their castanha was less than one and a
half entdo what would be the inevitable
happenkag

  the pelloroxo sleeping in his bateldo was
awakened by one of his indians to listen to a
noise up at the rubber shed he rolled out
of his hammock and stole up to investigate
but silently as he went as he approached
the shed a pistol was fired out of the dark-
ness and a ball coughed out over his head
toward the black river happily as i have
said pistol shooting is not so popular a
pastime among us as it is with you of the
north and we have no experts

  the pelloroxo fell to the ground and lay
waiting in uncertainty for only a fool will
walk into what he doesntknow in the dark-
ness but those others lacked the courage
to defendtheir position of advantage against
that pistol of which they had heard so much
they fled into the night and the pelloroxo
when he called for a light found some dozen
or so big sacks filled with his tagua nuts
ready to be taken away

  petty thievery was what he had hardly
expected but that was not a matter to
be greatly exercised about he sent an in-
dian to fetch his hammock he would sleep
in the shed and put a stop to that sort of
thing but there were men among the back
creek padrdos who were arriving now with
every hour of the night who would risk
much for the price that da sylvestra
offered-provided that the risk were not
too great

  as the pelloroxo was tying his hammock
ropes another shot came out of the dark-
ness this time he jerked his own pistol
jungle business



loose and fired at the flash and though he
missed in the dark he heard the startled
squeal of the man as the bullet must have
passed very close to his head that would
hold venturesome snipers for a while but
needless risk is foolish the pelloroxo called
his men to scoop him a pit in the top of his
pile of nuts and in thatiortress he spent the
night on guard

  with the coming of morning his cargo was
still intact but the light disclosed a string
of batelaos straining in the stiff current of
that place against their head ropes tied to
stakes the more fortunate early comers
nestled along the outer side of the steamer
though not more than a half dozen or so
for the captain would not allow too great a
weight to attach itself to the strain against
ills own cable which was bent round a stout
paxiuba palm

  the owners stood about in groups or
busied themselves with their boats all
elaborately unconcerned with the doings of
the lone foreigner yet all eyes shot furtive
glances at him and heads turned to look
after he had passed a veritable camp had
risen over night and all of it was hostile
to him

  what could he do he could not accuse
this man or that one at random of coming
in the night and attempting to steal his
nuts so as he passed among them he
took the cue to pretend that he had no sus-
picions against any man he greeted those
whom he knew as he went about his busi-
ness and showed an unconcern as great as
anybodys

  by daylight he felt safe for nobody would
care to make an issue against that very
wholesome reputation of his shooting and
the day passed without trouble of course
but that night was a different matter again

  more of the back creek padraos had
arrived and among them were bold spirits
who had to learn by experience attempts
to steal nuts more or less desperate were
made all through the night had it not been
for the fortunate convenience of the fortress
within the great pile of nuts who can tell
what ill chance might not have happened
for the shot of even the poorest sniper in the
dark might speed true

  this thing could not go on so the pel-
loroxo with the next morning bestirred him-
self betimes and stalked down to the
steamer both pistols swinging very much
in evidence to hold a parley with da

sylvestra but that crafty one pretending
to be still full of sleep in his hammock
snarled from the upper deck that he was
not in a mood to parley just now after
taking his morning toffee he would talk

  so the pelloroxo poor innocent returned
to his watch and sat down to wait without
thought of treachery had i been there i
could not have been so easily hoodwinked
for i have experience of some of those busi-
ness men of ours it would have been clear
to me that da sylvestra played only for
time to plan some new line of assault since
it must have been clear to him that his
paltry thought of bribing others to claw the
nuts out of the fire for him was not so suc-
cessful as he had hoped against the existing
respect for the gringos pistols he utilized
his time of course as well as any other
cunning fellow might the plan was simple
he collected a gang

  the senhor must not misunderstand me
in thinking that all those bateleros who
gather monthly at santa isabel are scoun-
drels most of them are good fellows
enough and some of the best have even
the makings of a good up-river man an-
tagonistic to the gringo who usurped their
trade they might well be as is natural but
the most of them would not stoop to regular
villainy

  yet in such a gathering of rough men
there are always enough who will undertake
much for money da sylvestra gathered
some half dozen such round himself and
then sent a message to the pelloroxo to say
that he was ready to talk the latter
walked down to the steamer without sus-
picion da sylvestra himself came down
the gang plank to meet him on the bank
where his hirelings lounged with unconcern
it was all so simple and like many a simple
plan it worked without a hitch

  da sylvestra proffered his hand in greet-
ing the pelloroxo accepted it da syl-
vestra gripped that dangerous right hand
fast and on the instant the rest leaped
upon the dupe

  what chance had he to struggle against
half a dozen he was quickly bound and
laid helpless and then at last da sylvestra
felt that he could afford himself the luxury
of the customary sneers that men of small
mind heap upon their adversaries when
helpless

  fool you thought to pit your feeble
wits against me and so forth
adventure

  then accompanied by much laughter
those hired bravos called upon their indians
to invade the rubber shed and load all their
victims tagua into the waiting hold of the
steamer when every last nut had been
removed they took the pelloroxos pistols
away from him retreated onto the steamer
and withdrew the gang plank then an in-
dian was ordered to loosen his bonds and
they from their safety shouted to him with
jeers that it would be good for his health to
keep out of sight and rifle shot

  a good coup and perfectly successful
the pelloroxo was left with no alternative
but to obey one can not single-handed
climb the side of an iron steamer against
rifle fire and some of those fellows from
the security of the steamer deck would
surely have fired had he attempted any such
insanity so the pelloroxo showed wisdom
in going away from there and retiring to his
own bateldo to plan whatever he might

and then i arrived the pel-
loroxo was of course raging as
was i also as soon as i heard the
full tale but while i was furious
and unable to contain myself his was a
colder anger he sat with a hard face and
narrow eyes and asked me first

  what is now the custom what may
be done without antagonizing yet further
the whole community and tell me just
how far is this place from the law it seems
to me very far indeed

  and i said

  death of a thousand saints it is six
long days steamer journey from the law-
and that is far enough what may be done
is to collect all our indians and to make a
war upon him and all the rest of this bribed
community who are your enemies already
what are they a city man and some fifty
bateleros they are nothing we can
summon half a thousand

  but his was the cooler judgment

  no he said it is a bad thing to try
and do business in the middle of an enemy
community and besides they are not
nearly so many for- he smiled with
tight lips and tapped me with emphasis on
the knee-look you my friend his own
cunning has turned against him for of the
fifty bateleroshow many of them are any
the better off he has filled up the hold
with my tagua nuts and they are left still
without cargo space for their product our

  enemies then are not fifty but six the half
dozen who have profited by his pay

  valgame deus i swore for it was
true those deserted ones would at least

be neutral entdo it is enough i said
we are two and with your bateldo crew and
mine we have twelve men sufficient we
will start a private war immediately we
can not go down to the open river bank
against their rifles but from the shelter
of the jungle we can pick them off at our
ease and with perfect security bring them
to terms

  but again he shook his head

  not so good amigo i have been think-
ing this thing over this few hours ahead of
you-and this bushwhacking does not ap-
peal to me in any case what we do we
must do quickly for consider they have
nothing to wait for now the captain will
soon get up steam and they will be gone
laughing at our helplessness

  - that was so i was taken aback

carramba what then

  he leaned over toward me and lowered
his voice for other batelaos were tied up
near us and neutral or no who knows who
might carry a tale

  in these hours i have been thinking of
a plan he told me with caution and that
is why i asked you how far was this place
from the law consider then you know
how the current swings from this place
assuredly i knew it was a stiff four-
mile current and it swung round the shoul-
der of that landing place and cut diagonally
across the wide breadth of the river where
it split some two miles down over the sand
spit at the head of peccary island many
a time have i been put to it driving my
men to hard paddling to avoid being washed
ashore there the pelloroxo fixed his gaze
upon me with narrow eyes

  what would happen said he if we
were to cut the steamers cable before they
could get up steam

  i	caught at my breath for i could foresee
the result but in the next instant i told
him

  you can never cut it they would fill
you with rifle balls from the deck before you
could swing a machete once

  he shrugged and grinned at last like he
was wont

  with a machete never he agreed
but with a rifle

  sanctissimas can you i demanded
jungle business



  he shrugged again

  why not my friend and so can you
consider we do notshoot at half a mile
from the close shelter of the adobe hotel
we command a clear view of that paxiuba
palm to which the cable is fastened and we
can take our leisure not in one shot may
we succeed nor in ten but why not in
fifty while i shoot-or you it does not
matter-the other will prevent interference
and who will interfere our enemies are
on the steamer as surely marooned from
the open bank as are we and why should
these others neutrals intrude themselves

  picarol the lad was right it was no
trick at all for the first time i was able
to laugh i said no word but stepped from
his bateldo into mine to fetch my rifle with
many shells his own was ready so we
went without more ado to the adobe hut
the proprietor knew me of old and with
him i made no bones i told him simply
that we proposed to use his house for a little
while for our private purpose and that he
would favor me by getting out swiftly and
telling all those trader fellows that i
theophilo and my friend the pelloroxo
would be engaged in a little business in
which we desired no interference basta
that was all

  without question he left us and the
pelloroxo laughing -grimly took a poncho
from the bed and spread it on the dirt floor
before the doorway then he lay down
confidently on his belly and snuggled him-
self to take an easy aim

  bet you i hit it first crack said he

  but he lost i could see in the clear water
beyond against which the cable stood out
stiff and black that the ball had flown high

he called softly on the name of the -

after the manner of you gringos and tried
again this time was better i saw a thin
spurt of dust and after its passing a little
frayed edge of cord stood up against the
light some two feet from the palm trunk

  braval i shouted i must join in this
good sport

  but already footsteps were running to see
what the shooting was about i stepped
quickly to the door to stand guard and to
those bateleros who came i said sternly that
this was entirely a private matter to which
i and my friend were attending ourselves
they offered no interference but stood
only wondering the pelloroxo took no
notice of them but continued calmly to

shoot from within the hut i was flattered
at his confidence in me presently another
little puff of dust flew from the cable and
then those others understood but beyond
a gasp of wonder and a thousand questions
they made no move to annoy me

  por diabo said one this will be a
merry surprize to that stiff-necked cap-
tain

  and another

  to that sylvestra bandido too i will
wager you friend joao that he cuts it in
ten shots

  i will stake a good machete against
that said the first

  so it was clear to me and a relief to my
anxiety that these men bore no particular
affection for that gang of ruffians who had
once again preempted the steamers hold
others of them took sides in the wagering
and added to the play and thereafter they
cursed or cheered according as the shots
went i was able to turn my attention to
possible interference from the steamer

  as yet those on board knew nothing of the
merry play beyond wondering perhaps
what all that steady shooting was about
but i took the precaution of slipping out
of the hut and taking up a sheltered position
in the nearby bushes from where i couki
command the deck if need should arise
to those who watched and wagered on the
exciting sport i said

  hola there go one of you and warn
your friends to stand clear of that cable for
this will not last long now and when it
parts it will snap back like a watch spring

         but i was still speaking when
an uproar suddenly arose on the
jfj steamer either they had felt
some vibration of the striking
shots transmitted along the cable or some-
body friendly disposed had given a warning
there was a shouting and much aimless
scurrying till presently somebody thought
to run out the gang plank while impatient
men with rifles waited fiercely to cross over
and put a stop to the menace

  here was where the tables of surprize
were to be turned upon that crew of bandits
i laughed and fired a shot that rang like a
cracked gong upon the plates of the steamer
right at the feet of the men who handled the
plank lead must have spattered into the
face of one of them for he yelled and leaped
up to fall and roll with his hands over his
ioo

adventure

eyes the rest yelled too with alarm and
leaped away from the plank letting it go in
their haste and it slipped from the deck and
trailed alongside by its rope

  that put a stop to that effort for a while
men ran about again in a frenzy and shouted
orders at each other each urging the rest
to do something while he himself scurried for
sheltered position some of the hired bravos
fired shots in the general direction of our
sound but i laughed again they could
see nothing at all to shoot at we were safe
i called to the pelloroxo to take it easy i
could hold them and he answered cheer-
fully

  righto hold them just a minute yet

  i fired again as a reminder to the venture-
some ones and hoping besides to puncture
the boiler the round top of which protruded
from the middle of the lower deck but in
this i failed and then suddenly before i
was well aware of it the steamer gave a
great heave as if struck a heavy blow a
confusion of shouts came from the adobe
hut and a great serpent of cable lashed back
hissing and coiled itself about the boats
bows

  i leaped up to shout with the rest-and
then ducked down again in haste for one
of the bravos still retained presence of mind
enough to fire at me but that was the last
after that all was confusion and cursing

calling upon the name of-and of all the

patron saints

  the steamers bows slowly swung away
from the bank as the current got beneath it
faster it swung and faster as the strong
outer current got its grip from the farther
side of the steamer arose more shouting and
imprecations as those batderos who had
made fast to the favorable position cast off
and paddled furiously to get out of the way

  on its stern as on a pivot against the
mud the steamer swung in a grand arc till
the bow had passed the middle point then
slowly the stern too left the bank and
swung free and the boat was in the full grip
of the current decrepit and rusted and
lacking paint though the thing was it
looked almost majestic as it drifted off with-
out steam swinging and waltzing to the
whim of the currents

  round the shoulder of the landing place
it floated and the crowd followed along the
bank some shouting futile advice to those
who hung helplessly over the rail some run-
ning aimlessly like ants as if they might

accomplish something sosoe laughing quite
the most of them laughing and all eager to
see the outcome it was a fiesta so much
entertainment had never been furnished at

santa isabel before

  but the outcome was sure as every
batelero knew the steamer went with the
current down stream and diagonally across
and there two miles down and two hundred
meters from the shore the sand spit of the
peccary waited

  in less than half an hour came the crash
sooner indeed than any one had expected
for the dry land was still quite a distance
away and i for one had never suspected
that the shallows of the spit extended so far
out yet crash is mot the right word for
that was no hard landing the boat driving
three-quarters on was seen to lurch once
stagger and halt apparently in its stride
then its momentum seized it and it ground
slowly on to a stop sending a veritable tidal
wave before it to scare the sand crabs

  well aground-and lucky at that for
the good lord he knows why he made a
sand spit at that splitting of waters where
there should have been bare rocks as at the
head of the other islands lower down some
curious shifting of the undersurface currents
doubtless caused it and thereby the life of
the ship was saved for beyond a slight
list it seemed to be otherwise unhurt

  from the crowd on the bank came a loud
aa-ahl as the boat remained stationary
and did not swing off to float on to sure
destruction on some one or other of the
lower islands with the loosening of the
tension came time for comment much of
it was ribald much jesting and all was
careless no man in that crowd had any
particular stake in tue fate of that steamer
they stood about for some time to see what
further interest might happen but nothing
did the shouting and the confusion died
down on the steamer and presently it was
apparent from the furious smoke issuing
from the funnel that they were getting up
steam

  sol said some she is unhurt they
will pull off and proceed

  so those who had business to attend to
gradually went away a few stayed and
waited to watch as did the pelloroxo and
i no words passed between us our coup
had been played but what now what
would be the final outcome our cargo of
tagua was still in the hold of that ship an
jungle business

hour passed or perhaps two i was keeping
no account of time then the shouting of
the captain came to us faintly over the
water the boat whistled-from habit i
suppose-and there followed a mighty
churning of sand and water from the great
stern wheel in reverse

  i held my breath and i observed that my
friends face too was hard and set but
still nothing happened more whistling and
billows of black smoke full of hot sparks and
more furious churning half an hour or so
of this but there the boat remained listed
perhaps a little less than before but still
fast at last i was able to breathe again
i looked at the pelloroxo his eyes were
still hard but he grinned

  how do you think friend theophilo is
the best way he asked speculatively to
bring our prisoners to terms

  prisoners was a word most satisfactory
to contemplate yet i asked him how he
could consider that we two on the bank
could call prisoners men who were on a ship
a quarter of a mile away even though stuck
fast upon a sand bank

  the boat can not leave that place he
said shortly and they can not leave the
boat

  how so i demanded

  but he only grinned the more hardly and
sat him down in the shade to wait i with
him wondering what would be the next
move it was not a long wait mighty
preparations went forth on the ship with
much shouting of the captain a great anchor
was lifted from the bow and lowered into a
boat the cable was lowered also and the
boat then proceeded to row off up-stream

  ha i exclaimed they will drop the
anchor above and will kedge off with the
winch carrambal they will escape us
yet

  that is to be seen said the pelloroxo
coolly this will be the test and as the
boat appeared from behind the steamers
body laboring up-steam he raised his rifle
and fired

  i heard the answering crack of the ball
somewhere in the boat and the scream of a
man in instant confusion the boat turned
and scurried back to the shelter of the
ship the pelloroxo grinned out wide

  the test holds good in our favor he
said grimly

  but even as he spoke one shouted a warn-
ing a bullet spattered among the rocks of

the shore front and the quick report of a
rifle came from the ship without waste of
time all who still watched scrambled for
shelter behind the jungle fringe in safety
the pelloroxo grinned at me as i embraced
him

  truly are they prisoners i agreed
they can not see us while we can watch
them at our leisure yet- a horrid
thought came to me-they will surely try
by night

  i am not at all afraid of the night said
the pelloroxo easily the distance is but
two hundred meters this is not the cloud
season and even when the moon will be
late the star reflection on the water will
show up a boat black against the surface
and they will have a long way to row with
that anchor no my friend they will not
succeed by night we can hold them for a
month

  and when we must at last sleep i
found objection

  but he was confident

  we will post our indians to watch and
wake us as soon as anything occurs their
eyes are better than ours and besides i
have taught my piloto to shoot

  there will be other dangers said i
assuredly said he but lesser ones
we shall meet them as they come

  and so it turned out to those other
bateleros who still watched from the jungle
fringe i said

  my friends this affair is our business
bullets that will come will be for us do
you therefore leave us to attend to our
business and will one of you do me the
favor to send my piloto

  so they went and if curiosity impelled
any to watch still they watched from some
other point leaving us to our vigil from our
selected spot directly opposite to the
stranded steamer

  with the first coming of the dark they
of course made another attempt to carry
out their anchor but it was as the pel-
loroxo had said the boat showed up as a
black smudge clear against the shiny surface
of the water a few balls from our rifles
sent them quickly scurrying back to the
shelter of the ship just as before whether
we struck or by how far we missed i could
not tell but what matter we went close
enough to make them realize that an open
boat is a wide target and that no one can
tell whom a ball might strike or when


adventure

  grtqa deus it is true i said we can
hold them for a month if need be

  and i laughed for the situation was not
without humor there were those brigands
having stolen our tagua nuts and here were
we able to keep them there at our will till
we should hit upon some plan of recovering
our property

  and the plan after much talk during the
following day was that i should come down
with all speed paddling a double crew night
and day to manaos where i have friends
who are even now ready to come back with
me and take back what is ours

  only one further danger i foresaw before
i came and that was that some of them
might make the farther shore under cover
of the night and the bulk of the ship and
ao row down-stream and across again and
men creep upon the pelloroxo through the
jungle but he was supremely confident
he leaned back against his comfortable bed
of leaves and lighted first one of those
terrible cigarets then he blew smoke into
the clean jungle and grinned without care

  psha said he have no fear on that
score i will post my indians in a circle
to watch they have their blow guns i
shall be safer than in a city have no fear
amigo but go swiftly and return with help
the ship at least will be here i can guar-
antee you that and i will be here keeping
watch with my rifle and my good indians
over our wealth and of those robbers
some may still be here some i think may
be dead others may well get a bellyful be-
fore our little bickering is over and they
may steal away what matter they can
not steal away our cargo any more

so there he is senhor your
fire-head son eating and drink-
ing and sleeping with a rifle across
his knees holding down a ship
load of robbers and here am i ready to
laugh at the situation for all things have

now turned in our favor and the situation
is in our hands and complete for look
you this is that fire-heads plan a plan

which has my approval

  that i charter here quickly a small river
steamer and go up with our friends and
transfer our stolen cargo right at the sand
spit

  come with us senhor to witness this
jest that will be your sons triumph for
consider what will then happen we shall
chase those robbers any who may still re-
main into the jungles we shall not hunt
them down for we are not vindictive
dientro let them suffer a while from the
insects before we let them return to the com-
munity of respectable folk when that time
comes they will have learned to leave alone
such men as theophilo da costa and
pelloroxo

  and the da sylvestra if we do not have
to kill him being caught with his charter of
the regular steamer must needs accept for
transport the castanha of all those other
padrdos at whatever price he can get-
which ho-ho it will not be much i can
tell you so shall the goodwill of the rest
of that community of santa isabel swing
back to us arid the last words of that
incorrigible fire-head to me as i left him
were

  in that institute in my home town they
taught me that the third most important
principle for conducting a business is so
to conduct it that you have the respect and
goodwill of your neighbors

  pot deus a true teaching but he did
not assimilate it for a long time not till
he came up to us of the upper rivers but
he has learned much he has learned and
he is established now as one of us king of
the tagua he will be and i i shall have a
one-third interest in the kings business
come with us then senhor and join in the
fiesta which we shall make with our friends
over that kingship
author of at penders gap

 the young operative followed his
chief old thelpin martin head of
the martin detective agency into
j the private office of mr jepther
ross president of the merchants national
bank

  sit down grunted mr ross and when
both martin and willis shaw had complied
in silence the bank president a grim old
man with a thin hawk-like face a mane of
snow-white hair and deep-set piercing gray

eyes continued

well what have you to report

 its

been four nearly five weeks since i gave you
the job of finding and bringing back both
mccray and the hundred thousand dollars
he stole from my bank so far as i can see
you havent accomplished anything have
you come to report that you give it up

  ignoring the thrust old martin said
quietly

 while we have been watching every
avenue of escape to central and south
america and combing every possible hiding
place here i have reason to believe that
your assistant cashier is going quietly about
his business within forty miles of the city

  had you had as much experience in run-
ning down criminals as i have mr ross
youd know that those are always the hard-

  the killing of tom mccray copyright  by how-
ard ellis davis

est to find-the ones who dont try to hide
or run far i think however that we have
our man spotted out at dolvin working
there under the name of james trueman as
a laborer in the saw-mill

  you think why dont you know
said the bank president impatiently why
didnt you have this suspect arrested and
brought in at once im going to have
tom mccray if it costs me another ten
thousand on top of what he made off with

  mr ross clenched his fist until the leaders
stood out on his forearm and pounded upon
his desk and it seemed to young shaw that
the vindictive old man was more bent upon
crushing mccray for his crime than he was
interested in returning to the bank the funds
that had been stolen

  i thought i had persuaded you jep-
ther martin replied that it would be best
to get the money first if possible rather
than arrest the man and after he had served
his prison sentence have him recover for
himself what he had hidden away it is
necessary to proceed very carefully how-
ever if im not handling the case to suit
you-

  thelpin martin shrugged his thick shoul-
ders and elevated the palms of his hands in
an excessive gesture

  mr ross glanced quickly at his old
friend then with a change of tone




adventure

  of course you know that im depending
on you theipin we understand each
other you realize my position-that i
dont want this matter known to the de-
positors of the bank-even to the stock-
holders-as long as there is any chance of
the moneys being recovered my cashier
is the only man here besides myself who
knows it was taken i have temporarily re-
placed the amount from my own funds
and of course i want that hundred thousand
back but i want mccray too again he
pounded on the desk with his clenched fist
go on whats your plan

  my plan is to send this young man
nodding in the direction of willis out to
dolvin to get a job with the saw-mill com-
pany there he is from a town up the state
and has been living here only since mccray
has been gone so there is no chance of
mccrays knowing who he is i have given
him a detailed description of the man we are
looking for and he has studied carefully
several photographs which we have been
able to get hold of

  his business will be to meet this man
trueman and learn as speedily as possible if
he is the man were after if trueman is
mccray he will try to gain the mans con-
fidence to a certain extent watch him care-
fully and learn if possible where the money
is hidden those swamps up there would
make an ideal hiding place i have learned
by the way that mccrays old home is
somewhere up in that neighborhood
jepther ross turned and gazed so steadily
at willis that the young man flushed

  all right he said tersely you know
what i want-both the money and the man
go to it

this interview was still fresh in
the memory of willis shaw as he
stood late that afternoon on the
front porch of the mill boarding-
house looking off across the bared slope to
the plant at the foot of the hill he could
hear the whine of the big circular saw as the
log was driven upon it the swift rumbling
retreat of the carriage when the cut was
finished

  the dull thud of squared timber shunted
from the skids reverberated through the
misty dusk came the sharp slap as board
was piled on board farther along the
machines in the planer droned in a con-
tinuous monotone the many lights about

the plant gave it tke appearance of a mina-

ture city then suddenly the big whistle
of the saw-mill boomed drowning the lesser
sounds followed a moment later by the
hoarser lesser volume from the whistle at
the planer the whine of saw and hum of
machinery ceased the engines slowed down
stopped where there had been a confu-
sion of many sounds reigned silence

  from the saw-mill planer lumber camps
and stock sheds streamed those who
throughout the day had toiled there-
brawny negroes dinner bucket swung on
arm straggling to the quarters beyond the
branch those whites who lived with their
families in the company houses the com-
paratively few who stayed at the boarding-
house

  at the supper table a half hour later he
was seated opposite trueman whom from
the photographs he carried willis recognized
instantly even before his name was called
boisterously by hansen the big swede
hey you there yim trueman the
swede said as he leaned forward and speared
a boiled potato with his fork cuttin them
small logs up live into deckin and piece
stuff keeps us yumpin ill say so

  jumping is right trueman replied with
a laugh as contrary to custom he passed to
willis a dish of hash before helping his own
plate

  i feed that edger so-fast that it seem

like one piece of lumber go through all the
time hansen continued on the other
side that edger you off-bear the lumber so
lively it seem like you dancin i seen you
go wobbly just before knockin-off time i
think old bear got you sure

  he was right behind me carl

  he get you tomorrow maybe

  oh no ive been promoted
  promoted

  the murmur went up from the men and
they paused in the hasty bolting of their
food to gaze at trueman

  yes the foreman told me he wanted me
on the log-deck to scale hes going to move
winters from the scaling job to the pond
willis noticed that the men smiled and
nodded in approval that job on the log-
decks a cinch-and more pay remarked
one

  knowed you was too good a man to stay
in that off-bearin job long said tobe
westgate a grizzled little man who fired the
dry-kiln
the killing of tom mccray



  as willis watched jim trueman smiling
talking laughing with the other men a
doubt began to creep into his mind mar-
tin his chief had described mccray the
absconding assistant cashier to him in de-
tail and he had carefully studied the
photographs

  there was a strong resemblance to this
man trueman and yet there was a marked
difference truemans face was thinner
and no such smile as truemans had lurked
about the eyes that had looked out at him
from the pictures of mccray the pictured
face had been tight-lipped rather cynical
martins description had borne out the im-
pression of the man willis had formed from
the photographs

  however he decided its either mc-
cray or a near relative and its up to me to
find out which

  when they had risen and filed out into the
hall he approached trueman who already
had turned toward the foot of the stairs

  this is mr trueman i believe he
said my name is shaw

  well the reply was uncompromis-
ing the mans face going suddenly hard
he extended no hand to acknowledge the
introduction

  mrs peterson told me that you are in a
room by yourself i wanted to see if you
wouldnt take me in with you

  no trueman snapped i told mrs
peterson emphatically that- but youve
got to sleep somewhere havent you he
interrupted himself his face breaking into a
sudden smile oh carl come here heres
a man to sleep with you

  sure said the big swede lumbering up
to them im glad of his company

  an hour later however willis crept from
hansens room and crossing the hall tapped
lightly upon the door through which he had
seen trueman enter at the rather sharp
bidding to come in he went into the room
closing the door behind him

  a fire was burning brightly and the room
had a cheerful homelike appearance but
his host stood in the middle of the floor
frowning at him evidently waiting for him
to state his business

  say trueman he exclaimed ignoring
the frown youve just got to take me in
hansen has that little stove in his room red-
hot and he says its too rainy and cold out-
side for me to raise a window his wet
shoes are beneath the stove and-er-by

jove old man if you dont let me come in
here ill have to move out into the hall and

bunk on the floor

with surprising suddenness trueman
threw back his head and laughed heartily

  youre certainly up against a combina-
tion of circumstances he said get your
things and come on over you can bunk
in here with me-until you can make other
arrangements just tell carl ive changed
my mind about taking you in dont
hurt his feelings his gray eyes softened
his hearts all right even if-if hes not
all that might be desired as a roommate
seated before the fire after the transfer
had been made trueman asked him
going to work here

  yes that is if i can get a job

  what doing

  anything i can find to do about the
mill

  you dont look like a laborer eyeing
the slight build of the other man

  im not always did book work willis
truthfully replied

  then why dont you try the office
did they dont need anybody got
to have a job of some kind

  well they are short-handed in the mill
but you look pretty soft might be able to
stand the racket though-if youve got the
guts and if you can hang to it-you must
hang to it it will help you

  knew a fellow once who had an office
job and got into a rut the longer he
stayed the deeper got the rut until it seemed
as if the sides reached up like straight walls
impossible to climb over he grew to hate
his job his boss and most of all himself

grew sour sour as - degenerated

wasnt a man any longer then he broke
away didnt climb out of the rut just
broke through and left got a job with his
hands-with his hands

  trueman now standing beside his chair
raised his muscular arms and clenched his
hands calloused and scarred in spite of the
heavy work gloves now resting on a comer
of the mantel

  worked his body nearly to death and it
made another man of him

  suddenly a light broke upon willis this
man whom trueman had described was
trueman himself in that other life in the
bank this accounted for the change of
contour in his face the change of expres-
sion about his eyes unconsciously he rose
io

adventure

to his feet and stood facing the other man
truemans very next words however threw
him again in doubt

  take me for instance i had an office
job once-and chucked it for this here
i-i believe im beginning to find myself
its harking back to the calling of my an-
cestors my father and grandfather were
both log men its bom in me to love the
smell of freshly sawed pine id rather feel
pine needles under my feet than the pave-
ment of any city that ever was created

  ill be on the log-deck now scaling logs
next ill go to the woods ill ask to be
sent there a year or two in the woods
among the timber then-well this plant is
comparatively young

  there are fifty thousand acres of virgin
timber into which their logging road is just
beginning to crawl who can tell what
might be in store for a fellow whos got the
right stuff in him these people are wide
awake appreciative the president is
through the mill or in the woods every day
i have reason to believe it was he suggested
that i be put on the log-deck yes sir
i believe im beginning to find myself
for the sake of my old mans memory id
like to

  his tall rather slender figure erect hands
thrust deep into his pockets the color
mounting high in his thin tanned cheeks
trueman had been pacing up and down the
room his speech coming jerkily more as if
he talked to himself  giving voice to thoughts
that crowded his brain until there must be
an outlet

  suddenly now he paused in his stride and
a harsh laugh broke from his lips then as
if it were something unconsciously done he
turned and seizing a piece of wood threw it
upon the fire with such violence that the live
coals flew scattering out upon the thread-
bare rug while willis with a folded news-
paper was hastily brushing them back upon
the hearth the other man abruptly left the
room surprized somewhat bewildered the
young detective stood gazing at the sharply
slammed door

the days that followed were
trying ones for willis he was
soft and clumsy about his work
and stuck at his job as a mill-hand
only by sheer force of will he let no op-
portunity pass to search for the stolen funds
though he had never been able fully to

make up his mind that jim trueman was
the alias of tom mccray on that first
night after having been left so unceremo-
niously by trueman who had not returned
until long after willis was in bed he had
made a thorough search of the room care-
fully combing through the other mans few
possessions thumping and prodding the
mattress and even having pried loose some
boards at the back of the shallow closet
he searched the adjoining loft beneath the
eaves

  guarded inquiries revealed the fact that
trueman tramping in over the logging-
road his bundle carried at the end of a short
stick over his shoulder had arrived in dol-
vin about a week after the bank was robbed
no one of those of whom willis casually in-
quired seemed to know where trueman had
come from or why so little was known about
the man

  jovial and friendly with the other men he
was a prime favorite among them and he
threw himself into his work at the mill with
an abandon that was good to see but at
night within his room he drew into his shell
and had little to say that he was laboring 
under a tremendous mental strain was very
evident which willis reasoned was only
natural and yet at times the impression
persisted that this was not the man they
were after that trueman was not the alias
of tom mccray

  perhaps he thought one evening as he
sat by the fire watching the other man end-
lessly pace the floor he is some near rela-
tive who knows of mccrays crime and feels
a certain amount of responsibility mc-
cray may be hiding about his old home near
here and may have sent for trueman with
whom he is keeping in touch

  the idea was rather startling with
nothing tangible upon which to base this
line of reasoning he decided to accept it as
a hunch and spend the following sunday
investigating the old home where according
to thelpin martin mccray had spent his
boyhood

  on the fourth day at the mill willis
sprained his arm he had been placed in
the hole near the sawyer tripping slabs from
the live rollers a job that required no great
amount of intelligence but quickness and
some dexterity in the use of a pick-a place
usually held by a negro

  but the run of logs was small-top logs
most of them scarcely did it seem that a
the killing of tom mccray



slab had flopped to the roller-bed after the
cut by the circular and been snatched off
into the conveyor by him than the carriage
retreated the log was turned by the steam-
nigger and the powerful twin engines drove
the carriage forward again at tremendous
speed leaving another slab with which to
wrestle sometimes before the first slab
was removed a second came nosing along
the live-rollers fouling it often they got
crosswise jerking clawing with both hands
and pick doggedly he persevered

  as the day wore on his wrenched arm
pained him without ceasing the muscles
throughout his body stiff and sore from the
unaccustomed toil clamored for rest in
the palm of his right hand an open cut from
a piece of bark burned with the salt of his
sweat his nerves torn to a frazzled edge
it seemed as if the sharp whine of the saws
and the clank of the machinery were splin-
ters driven into his brain

  the men began to watch him knowing
grins stamped upon their faces for ia their
vernacular the old bear was about to get
him-an incident always treated as a huge
joke from the log-deck trueman waved
and smiled encouragingly once or twice
when the sloping ramp that fed the car-
riage with fresh logs was full he ran down
and thrusting willis aside took his place
for a spell

  neb horton the sawyer a large-framed
bony man with small blue eyes grinned
tantalizingly as he tried to smother wil-
lis and at last when it seemed inevitable
that the boys trembling knees would buckle
beneath him when his eyes were dimmed
with the tears of exhaustion and mortifica-
tion he began to be filled with a rage against
the man who was persistently giving him
just a little more than he could do

  a light slab jerked too soon from the
roller-bed struck him sharply on the leg
and this trivial incident was the straw that
snapped his self-control with a cry he
dropped his pick caught up the slab and
rushed upon his tormentor

  -you he shouted and he brought

the slab down across the sawyers shoulder

  the grin never leaving his face horton
released the knob of his lever for a moment
swept back his arm and the big open palm
of his gloved hand struck willis heavily on
the side of the head

  reeling from the blow willis heel caught
on something and he fell sprawling on his

back on a solid floor of boards upon a low
conveyor which moving slowly carried them
sideways against trim-saws at either side
that cut them to uniform length

  he was not stunned but he lay inert up-
on his back his legs from the knees down
dangling over the end of a wide plank un-
conscious of the planks slow progress along
the conveyor he relaxed his tortured mus-
cles and he was only vaguely aware of
shouts above the sound of the machinery
of a sudden cessation in the rumbling of the
carriage then he was seized by the heels
and jerked with a thump to the floor

  scrambling to his feet he found himself
looking into the face of a giant negro who
his dark skin turned a peculiar gray his
eyes rolling whitely was gibbering unin-
telligibly behind the negro horton the
sawyer was shouting hoarsely a little
back a half-smile upon his thin handsome
face trueman stood with folded arms

  then thrusting himself forward the saw-
yer shook a gloved finger in willis face

  you go on home youngster and rest up
for the balance of the day he said an-
other six inches before jim trueman got
you by the feet and youd have been flop-
pin around here in two pieces

  and he mopped his anxious face with his
glove leaving a streak of grease behind

  with a falling-away sensation at the pit
of his stomach willis turned and gazed
with widening eyes at the whirling trim-saw
the existence of which he had forgotten but
which inevitably would have ripped him
in two with the board upon which he had
lain

  the foreman a youngish man with gray-
ing hair beneath his cap came running
up meeting him with his expressive smile
trueman said

  mr higgins havent you a man yoii
can send in here to take shaws place for the
balance of the afternoon hes-well he
paused to laugh the old bears been right
behind him for an hour or so

  smiling understanding the forman nod-
ded and turned away and willis some-
what shakily descended the stairs and left
the mill the incident was closed per-
haps for those he was leaving behind amid
the shriek of saws and the clank of ma-
chinery it was not an unusual part of the
days routine

  for him it held the added significance
that to the man suspected of having robbed
io

adventure

the merchants national of a hundred thou-
sand dollars and on whose trail he had been
set he owed his life

ek that night after supper when
 he was seated in their room be-
f fore the fire he tried to express
something of the gratitude he felt

  jim old man you saved my life this
afternoon he began i want to tell you
how-

  trueman who was pacing up and down
the floor turned on him with an impatient
gesture frowning

  thats all right he said it was noth-
ing lets say no more about it

  but if you hadnt been watching me and
got there when you did i-

  id rather not talk tonight if you dont
mind trueman said and willis saw about
his companions gray eyes an expression of
weariness as one sees about the eyes of a
man who has sat days and nights on end in
a hopeless vigil at the bedside of a stricken
comrade

  slowly unlacing his shoes willis covertly
watched him to him the man was an
anomaly a puzzle that he found it impos-
sible to solve the esteem in which he as
well as the other men held trueman and
certain sterling qualities that at times
cropped unconsciously to the surface made
it almost impossible for him to believe that
he holding a position of trust in the bank
could have betrayed it as tom mccray
had done

  softened now by the debt of gratitude
which he could never adequately repay
and by a pity induced by that hopeless ex-
pression on truemans face he was formu-
lating in his mind a report to his chief
setting forth his belief that he was shadow-
ing the wrong man when with that abrupt-
ness which had characterized his action the
first night trueman left the room slam-
ming the door after him

  instantly willis realized that it was his
duty to act if trueman was going out on
this blustery rainy night to the hiding place
of the banks funds he must follow him and
learn where the money was hidden if as
he had half suspected trueman was in
touch with some relative and was going
now to meet him willis must learn of
this other man

  slipping off his shoes and carrying them
in his hand he turned out the light and

crept into the dark hall and down the stairs
in the hall below he heard the other man
fumbling at the rack beneath the stairs
where the men hung their hats ignoring
the need of a covering for his own head he
waited until trueman had gone out of the
front door then slipped out after him

  the gate clicked as willis paused on the
steps to draw on his shoes a moment
later he too was outside following at a safe
distance the dimly-seen figure that passed
around the fence and out into the road
beyond

  for several days there had been heavy
intermittent showers and the road was
deep in red mud or patches of watery sand
tonight it was colder and the rain had
slackened in volume to a blowing mist at
intervals a moon half-revealed itself through
shredded clouds

  regardless of the mud trueman ploughed
straight down the middle of the road at
times the enshrouding darkness shut him
completely from sight at others when the
clouds overhead thinned his figure was dis-
tinctly outlined a mile from the village a
dark object caught by a sweeping gust of
wind came whirling along the road and
flattened against willis legs he picked it
up and found it to be truemans soft hat

  apparently heedless the other man did
not pause but ploughed steadily on wtien
the moon shone down through a temporary
rift in the cloud curtain willis saw that
his bare head was thrown back his face
turned up to the night

  steadily they floundered on until more
than three miles must have stretched be-
hind them then trueman turned into a
side road almost indistinguishable in the
darkness this in time led to a bawling
creek well out of its banks the road
crossed by a ford and into this without
pausing trueman continued though the
water soon reached to his waist

  stopping in surprize willis stood watch-
ing him then he sought and found a foot-
path that led to a log crossing the stream
just above the ford

  he was halfway across the log when
from the middle of the creek below him a
burst of harsh laughter rang out upon the
blustering night followed by some words
which the wind swept away before they be-
came distinguishable

  edging along the log willis came to a
place where he could see a dark blotch upon
the killing of tom mccray	

the waters of the ford again there was a
burst of wild laughter horrible to hear a
hoarse shout was flung into the teeth of the
wind followed by convulsive sobbing low
chortling almost as if someone were being
choked

  my- willis breathed to himself

the poor fellow has lost his mind

  for a quarter of an hour he looked on
from his point of vantage but for the last
ten minutes the man waist deep in the creek
with the dark waters swirling about him
had stood in perfect silence then true-
man turning suddenly splashed back to the
road and willis hastily recrossed the log
shrinking into the bushes as the other man
leaving the road turned up beside the creek

  the course through the woods led pres-
ently to a deserted log shack through the
sagging door of which trueman entered a
match flared and peering through a crack
willis saw him kindling dry wood within a
mud fireplace

  suddenly as he bent above the growing
flame trueman raised his head with a jerk
and called over his shoulder

  come on in willis

  for a moment longer willis stood with-
out moving his eyes glued to the crack
unable to believe that he had heard aright
then subconsciously attributiag the knowl-
edge of his presence to some instinct pos-
sessed by the demented he went around to
the door and entered pausing just within
the cabin expecting to find a man entirely
devoid of reason

  instead the face lighted by the crackling
flames that trueman turned to him had
undergone a wonderful transformation in
another way though the gray eyes were
still heavily shadowed by dark circles the
expression of weariness was gone certain
fines about the mans mouth had smoothed
out and he greeted willis with a frank boy-
ish smile his white teeth gleaming

  didnt think i knew you were following
me did you he said i knew it when we
left the house but i had forgotten it until a
moment ago

  willis moistened his dry lips with his
tongue but said nothing

  come on over by the fire you must be
soaked trueman continued have a seat
on the floor its the best i can offer
dropping to his knees by the fire willis
said huskily

  jim old man i-i thought you had

gone crazy i was just below you on a log
when you were standing out in the middle of
the creek back there and the-the way you
were going on i thought you were insane
trueman laughed i guess you did
he said and perhaps i was temporarily

i killed a man back there in the creek
  wh-what

   yes sir it was a hard fight but i killed
him

   willis leaned and peered anxiously at the
other man

  i heard something like-like choking
and i couldnt see much in the darkness
but i-i didnt think there was anybody
but you

   he was there all right

  and you mu-murdered him drowned
him in the creek

  drowned in the creek or not murdered
whatever you will i killed him dead as

- thank god

   gently placing a hand on his companions
drenched shoulder willis said soothingly
lets go home jim youre unstrung
with a hot drink of something inside of you
and a few hours sleep youll feel better
impatiently trueman shook the hand
from his shoulder

  you still think im imbalanced he
said but you be quiet without inter-
rupting me until i tell you something
then i have a job for you

   in the first place from certain indica-
tions i have suspected almost from the
beginning that you were sent out to find
tom mccray who robbed the merchants
national of a hundred thousand dollars in
cash i also was after mccray your
presence complicated matters for me for i
was afraid you might arrest him before i
had a chance to-to get to him and kill him
beneath the floor of this shack is the money
he stole from the bank i am going to get
you to return it -and tell the president mr
ross that mccray his former employee is
dead and you may tell him that what
happened to mccray is due almost entirely
to him

ipijpjl raising a loose board beside
him trueman drew out a bundle
wrapped in heavy brown paper
untying the cords that bound it
he displayed the bundles of currency so
that willis could roughly estimate them
then he wrapped them up again
no

adventure

  its all there he said every dollar
of it

  this mccray willis whispered still
too shocked to comprehend fully ihe was
some relative of yours

  for years he was closer to me than a
brother perhaps you will think it would
have been the better the more manly
course if i had returned the money to the
bank myself instead of sending it back by
you and had let mccray suffer for his crime
i will not try to argue that with you be-
cause already i have suffered the tortures
of the damned in uncertainty trying to make
a decision upon one of two courses

  for i had fully made up my mind that
either tom mccray must die or he must go
and plead guilty to the theft and return the
money there could be no halfway mea-
sure i met him tonight and killed him
and you have proved a convenient agent for
taking back the banks funds

  he rose to his feet held out the bundle to
the young detective and extended his hand

  you can catch the early morning train
into the city he said

  willis took the money but he refused the
outstretched hand

  no jim he said huskily you per-
haps thought you were justified in killing
this man but i-i cant shake hands with
his murderer-especially after the cold-
blooded way in which you went about it
i understand trueman said a slight
smile crossing his lips this matter has
come upon you rather suddenly you
havent had time to think it over when
you have thought and understood and if
you think then that i should be brought to
account for what i have done you will find
me still in the employ of the banson lum-
ber company i give you my word of honor
as a gentleman that i will not leave

  and bear in mind willis that tom
mccray had become the degenerate he was
because the individuality and manhood had
been stamped out of him by his employer
jepther ross it were better was my de-
cision that this degenerate should die and
the past be blotted out than that he should
plead guilty and dragging out the years of
his prison sentence sink through hate into
a lower creature than ever because know-
ing mccray as i did i knew that is what
would have happened

  not offering again to shake hands he
patted willis affectionately on the shoulder

turned him about and started him in the

direction of the door

  youd better be on your way old man
he said

descending from the train
in the city several hours later
willis young face was lined with
weariness and the ordeal through
which he had passed when he had had
time to think and to realize definitely the
position in which he stood relative to the
crime of james trueman at first he had
been torn with doubt as to how he should
act then he had made his decision from
a booth at the station he called his employer
and through the early dawn drove out to
old thelpin martins home

  refreshed and breakfasted and with what
seemed to him tons of responsibility lifted
from his shoulders he followed thelpin into
mr ross private office as soon as the presi-
dent had arrived at the bank when
without invitation thelpin dropped into a
chair willis placed on the desk before the
bank president the bundle containing the
stolen funds

  here is the money you sent me after
he said simply

  to willis surprise mr ross shoved the
bundle aside almost impatiently wheres
tom mccray he demanded

  he is dead sir

 eh-eh whats that dead

  yes sir

  but why -what - i - i dont under-
stand mr ross had slumped back in his
chair and sat gazing blankly up at willis
and an ashen gray pallor had overspread his
stern old face

  i-id rather not talk about it if you
dont mind sir there is your money
tom mccray is dead and there was the
bite of sarcasm in his voice as he told
the vindictive old man you ought to be
satisfied

  then leaning forward so suddenly and
aggressively that willis retreated a step
jepther ross brought his fist smashingly
down on the desk and demanded

  did you kill him

  he spoke slowly through clenched teeth
and the keen eyes glaring from beneath
their heavy white brows seemed shot with
points of fire

  willis put so suddenly upon the defen-
sive stammered in his reply
the killing of tom mccray

in

  why no sir i-i didnt kill him

  he had not found it hard to believe
truemans story of jepther ross oppression
of tom mccray but he felt now a sense
of amazement at the passion that seemed to
grip the old man because death had cheated
him out of wrecking his vengeance on the
absconding assistant cashier

  who did kill him then mr ross was
demanding were you present at his
death what you know about it how
did you get the banks funds did you see
him at all

  i was with tom mccray from the time
i reached dolvin willis replied quietly to
this volley of questions we occupied the
same room on the night the funds were
recovered he-he killed himself

  again jepther ross sank weakly back in
his chair killed himself he whispered
hoarsely oh my god my god and
he covered his face with his hands

  released from the fierce eyes that had
seemed to hold his own willis turned ques-
tioningly to thelpin martin and to his
surprize found a satisfied smile on the old
detectives lips sinking weakly into a
chair willis mopped his perspiring face

  to think that it should have come to
this mr ross said softly a fresh coun-
try boy son of the man who had been my
best friend i brought him here and ruined
him and i didnt realize it until he had
gone though i loved him as if he had been
my own son i never let an opportunity pass
to crush out his individual impulses and
ideas thinking to graft my own upon him in
their stead

 and-how i worked him two years

ago he moved from my home and i knew
then that he was beginning to hate me but
i would not relent thinking that my course
was the best for him it was only after he

was gone that i realized what i had done-
that i had persecuted him until he had lost
his manhood and his mind was ripe for
crime if-if you had brought him back to
me thelpin i would have told him so and
on my knees i would have begged his for-
giveness but now-

  jepther ross body was shaken with a
convulsive sob and willis saw tears slipping
from between his fingers

  then before willis realized what was
taking place mr ross was on his feet his
thick white hair seeming to stand straight
up upon his head his face contorted with
passion his arms extended he leaned above
willis his long strong fingers closing and
unclosing as if they itched to get at the
young mans throat

  you hounded him to death he hissed
you damned contemptible scoundrel
you hounded that poor boy until he took

his own life i-you-you-

  but thelpin martin was now between
them forcing mr ross back to his chair

  there there jep he said gently with
the familiarity of a long long friendship
sit you down sit you down its all turn-
ing out just right-like i figured it would
with a nod over his shoulder he dismissed
willis from the room

  having forced mr ross back into his
chair thelpin stood behind him with his
hands resting affectionately upon his shoul-
ders and as willis moved quietly across the
room and tried to slip without noise through
the door he heard the old detective add
now that youve learned your lesson
jep well have a little further talk then
well run out to dolvin on the noon train
and somebody and it wont be tom mc-
cray will be given another chance and if
you make good well see- oh well well
see whatll well see

      author of the bush lopers the homesteaders etc

the first part of the story briefly retold in story form

prank ellis woke up one bright morning in
california gulch to find himself a total failure
all through the winter of  he had trailed from
one holding to another until the gold mining season
was at a close he was penniless and he had a sister
back east who believed him a great success there
was nothing left for him to do but take a job over
the lunch counter of the great western hotel
under the hand of george skillings boss

  as he was serving his first meal to a group of
miners traders and mine employees he uncon-
sciously burst into a plaintive song

  stop that-racket the boss roared

  from that time on he was the singing pilgrim
the pilgrim became a drawing card nate goss
the gambler rabbit the indian doomed to death
by his tribe on a charge of killing a brother tribesman
ancient days an old-time placer miner bones
a man with a prehistoric delusion of great beasts in
the gulches-all fell into the lure of the pilgrims voice

chapter iii

the improvement committee

 goss and whip king met at the
 boston hotel for the midday
 meal and under cover of the con-
 fusion discussed the homicide

  he wouldt have run away if he hadnt
done it admitted goss if hed gone
back to the hut and pretended to be asleep
when they called for him he might have
fooled them	

  whip king reputed to be the best wagon-train
boss between the river and the coast arrived in the
gulch with a startling crack of his monstrous whip
he had no special destination no special enemies
and he cared little for firearms but he proved to
be the friend of many restless men who fought
constantly many was the time that his long lash
sent men armed with six-shooters cowering in the
corner

  with the season almost ended and too many men
finding almost no gold things in california gulch
became a bit thick goss had a fight with charlie
dodge the monte gambler as a result of unfair
play and finally the pilgrim fought with his boss
the fight itself was inconsequential but a threat
loomed in the background when the pilgrim swore
vengeance

  that night skillings the boss was found with a
knife in his heart and and the singing pilgrim was
missing from california gulch

  acted like a fool rumbled whip king
but we must remember hes young

  i knew he was down on his luck and had
guts enough to fight if cornered con-
tinued goss but i never dreamed hed
sneak back in the night and use a knife
think of his going out to nail an enemy and
not packing a weapon skillings was killed
with his own knife

  probably he did pack a gun along and
then was afraid to use it

  then why didnt he carry a knife
mine is still at the hut and he never wore

one must have banked strong on his luck
to depend on snatching a knife from skill-
ings had to grab it from skillings belt
when he was coming over the tail-board
he couldnt have had time to try for it
after skillings feet hit the ground

  skillings needed killing badly mused
whip king but its all so darned mixed
up something aroused skillings he lit
out the wagon carrying a fight if he had
any weapon besides his knife where is it
if only the knife he would have it in his
hand then how could the younker take it
away from him skillings was a powerful
built man

  goss shook his head

  lots of puzzles but the main facts re-
main-skillings is dead by his own knife the
pilgrim has ducked out and ancient days
and big bones are missing ancient and
bones liked the pilgrim they lit out so
they wouldnt have to tell on him young-
sters got a sister back east hes been
feeling blue along of not making a strike
told me something about her if skillings
only could have been killed by some one
else id have staked ellis to take over the
great west and run it on his own hook but
thats all in the fire now

  a man at a table near the entrance of the
tent exclaimed loudly oaths and angry
cries ran along the first table several men
jumped up and ran from the tent in the
street outside much savage talk resounded
goss dark eyes blazed with desperation

 by- theyve caught him he

whispered to whip king im going out
you neednt come into this its none of
your hash

  some of the cattle seem to be tangled
up gruffly replied whip king think i
can help straighten out the mess he must
have a square show dont try any gun
play he had a right at the wagons
went back to sleep there with his two
friends skillings broke from the corral
with a knife had tried to kill him before
self defense is the ticket ought to go in
any miners court

  but before they could leave the table the
proprietor of the boston hurried up to them
and excitedly cried

  what do you think that skillings was
worse than we supposed

  the singing pilgrim harshly broke in
goss where is he

  good land how should i know when

  

dont anybody seem to know goss re-
laxed the proprietor continued

  a committee examined into skillings
property sos we can advertise for heirs in
the rocky mountain news and what do
you think

  you never mind what we think spose
you tell what you think growled whip
king

  well theyve found twenty thousand
dollars in counterfeit script hidden in his
wagon the one he slept in

  the proprietor paused to enjoy their
surprize

  goss laughed rejoicing that ellis had not
been captured also because skillings death
would seem less of a crime now the bogus

money had been found whip king was
excited by the news and mumbled heatedly
recovering his composure he lamented
to think no one suspected him he
was receiving supplies of the script and
holding it for others to pass he was one
of the gang thats working from denver to
new mexico if the men chasing the pil-
grim knew this latest theyd be coming back
and wishing the pilgrim good luck

  but the proprietor discouraged any such
belief by adding

  many of the men now believe the pil-
grim was in cahoots with skillings about the
counterfeit money theyre more keen to
find him than ever

euchred snapped goss rising im
going to my shack to get a few hours sleep
ill drift over to the miners home and
keep my ears open for more news mumbled
whip king

  goss went to his small log cabin and
threw himself on the bunk intending to get
a bit of sleep against the waking hours of
the night for an hour he tossed and
turned his mind persisting in dwelling on
the problem of skillings death the door
ii

adventure

creaked and began to open the gamblers
eyes were apparently closed in slumber
the right hand hung limply over the side of
the bunk the fingers touching the butt of a
forty-four handgun he saw the aperture
widen he recognized the dark face and
drew his hand from the gun and called out-
come in

  the rabbit entered and softly closed the
door behind him goss coldly advised-
my friend you should learn the white
mans way of knocking

  rabbit leaned his rifle against the logs and
seated himself on the floor and lighted his
pipe

  if the white man slept i did not wish to
disturb him he finally said

  i am awake my ears are open re-
plied goss

  after a few puffs the hunter announced-
  i bring a talk from the singer

  goss dark features remained immobile
he quietly repeated my ears are open
the man who will go back to be hung by his
own people will not bring me a he

  shot tersely corrected the hunter it
was agreed i should die as a hunter kills i
was drunk and i killed a drunken man who
was trying to kill me

  and theres nothing to make you go
back to the indian nation to be shot

  i said i would be there on june first next
year if alive was the stolid reply i
have learned to read and write like a white
man but i am still indian enough to keep
my word if i did not go back my father
brothers even my old mother would offer
themselves in my place

  few white men care to keep promises
made to death mused goss my ears
are open

  lowering his voice almost to a whisper
the red hunter informed-

the singer is hiding at twin lakes
goss opened his eyes slowly and came to a
sitting posture on the edge of the couch

  after killing skillings he should have re-
mained here

  rabbit shook his head and replied-

  he did not kill skillings

  then why did he run away harshly
demanded goss

  for once he was unable to conceal his
surprize

 many white men heard him say he
would kill skillings if the white man tried to
hurt him white men will not take a white

mans word as my people will take my word
he knew they would say he killed

  how did he know skillings had been
killed demanded goss

  i came here and told him i was among
the first to reach the wagons i knew he
would be blamed before the white men read
all the signs your people hang first then
ask questions after you came along and
they began to say he did it i came here and
woke him up and led him to the lakes we
finished the fifteen miles by sunrise i
started back here at once he is sick in the
heart he felt better when i said i would
take a talk to you today he has blankets
and meat i shall take him a gun

  rabbit youve tipped the kettle over
groaned goss

  the hunter made no defense except to
remind him-

  they were crying hang him hang
him when i led him away from this place
goss said no more what was done had
been done through friendship but had
ellis been found soundly sleeping in the
hut with no signs of the homicide upon him
his innocence would practically have been
established goss quietly asked-

  what is the talk

  he says for you to look for letters at the
express office and send them back to him
by me

  i will do that and write something to
him but where will he go what will
he do

  he has two legs and is young he can
go where he chooses he can work for
white men

  and be found and hung he ran away
no miners court would believe you or him
now theyre even saying he and skillings
passed worthless money in the gulch
that is bad gravely agreed the indian
a court of my people would believe me
but he will not be found if he is wise the
season will soon close the miners will
have eyes only for the wagons taking them
east or for the bars and dancehalls of the
valley towns he is called the singing
pilgrim he can take any name he will and
if he does not sing no one will be looking for
him after another moon before it is time
for me to go back and be killed he can come
back to his camp and no one will bother him
white ears in colorado hear nothing but the
voice of gold

  you talk-smooth rabbit
pards

ii

  the hunter emptied his pipe and stood up
and remarked

  my red name means the first speaker
when will you write your talk for the
singer	

  goss paced the small room perplexed to
know just what word he would send if
ellis was not found inside of another twenty-
four hours the searchers would be returning
to their work and the peak of the danger
would be passed

  when do you go back to him
  tonight after it is dark

  see me before you go and i will have my
talk ready i can not think straight now
i will look for letters for him

  he was at the door when goss shot after
him-

  rabbit who killed skillings

  the hunter paused but made no reply
  did you goss demanded

  no a white man killed him

  do you have any idea what white man
  i know the man

  who is he

  i have not said

  and with that the indian passed through
the doorway

disgusted by the indians
reticence the gambler threw him-
self into a barrel-chair and grap-
pled with the problem ellis
flight had convicted him in the minds of a
great majority of oros citizens the dis-
covery of the bogus script had inflamed the
public against him as well as against the
dead man

  with no jails for housing the accused and
with no patience for drawn-out hearings let
alone the entire lack of legal mechanism for
conducting the same the camp was bound
to try convict and execute and have done
with a disagreeable business as expeditiously
as possible of course there was the chance
of a speedy acquittal did ellis return and
stand his trial

  had it not been for the discovery of the
counterfeit money goss would have sent
peremptory word for the pilgrim to return
but now he would not assume that respon-
sibility the young man was foot-free and
doubtless the indian was right in saying the
affair would be forgotten before another
season to risk hanging for the privilege of
remaining a few more weeks in the camp
would be absurd

  the gambler procured a sheet of paper
and a pencil and attempted to compose a
message after ten minutes of false starts
he threw down the pencil and tore up the
paper he would send ellis some money
and a good revolver but as to advice he
knew not what to write he had a notion
of smuggling him into whip kings east-
bound wagon train but he first must have
whip kings permission

  even with that secured there was no
knowing when whip king would start east
or from what point obviously the thing to
do was to hunt up his friend and ask his
advice and help he believed ellis would
be safe in any of the northern camps now
that men were cleaning up their claims and
preparing to join a homeward-bound outfit
or planning to spend the winter in denver or
other towns the season was too late fotr
much travel back and forth between the
camps

  but hed have to go to the towns soon
even if he goes now to a camp he mused
so he might as well go to town now as
later but what town whip king shall
name it best way would be to send him
back east where he belongs

  goss calling made him selfish he could
easily spend his winnings or give them
away but to mortgage his time and en-
deavors came a bit hard yet he genuinely
desired to help the likable young fugitive

  he gave up the idea of sleep and decided
to find whip king and ask his advice
cached in the floor under his couch was a re-
serve fund of two thousand dollars in script
and gold he intended to send ellis a hun-
dred of this he carefully brushed his
sleek hair and belted a gun on his hip and
slipped another the one he would give to
ellis into a holster under his left arm he
would write his letter from the miners
home after talking with his friend the
freighter as he did not plan to return to
the hut before meeting the rabbit he
dropped on his knees by the couch and
started to tap his cache for a hundred dollars

  the door flew open and still squatting on
his heels he spun about the belt-gun drawn
and cocked whip king promptly stuck up
his hands

  what the -- impatiently exclaimed
goss your manners are bad or my
nerves are ragged

  and in disgust at his gun display he
tossed the weapon on the couch and
n

adventure

motioned for his friend to take the barrel-
chair

  ignoring the invitation the wagon boss
exploded-

  catch-up and stretch out or make a
fighting corral

  meaning just what whip softly asked
goss his dark eyes glowing

  camps mad as taos whisky that
counterfeit script found in skillings wagon
is raising hobb they now saying the sing-
ing pilgrim was one of the gang

  well go on how do i figure in what
the camp thinks demanded goss as his
friend paused

  some hot-heads say the boy slept here
along of you being such a friend to him
theres talk that you knew about the
crooked money

  let one of them dare to say as much to
my face

  theres fifty headed this way to say it to
your face they swear theyll clean the
gulch you light out

  no i know no more about the counter-
feit than the pilgrim does that means
nothing i have done nothing except
gamble

  you gave the younker a bed theyre
foolish enough to make a lot of it

  ill go when a committee tells me to
im not a fool but i wont run before the
camp says the word

  whip kang nervously played with the
long lash of his whip and warned

  theyll be here soon maybe you wont
have a chance to go you know the hair-trig-
ger temper of a crowd that suddenly decides
to make a mining camp pure and noble
goss returned to the couch and quickly
emptied the cache disposing of the money
in various pockets whip king looked
much relieved and urged-

  dont bother about anything else ill
look after your belongings

  im not running away before i hear the
talk you trot out of here ill play the
hand alone

  like - think you can fight the

whole gulch

  im not looking for a fight ill hear the
committees talk ill say its a lie then
ill quit if allowed to go decently but
i wont be man-handled or hustled

  ive hustled to get here ahead of them
im afraid they wont let you go omi-
nously warned whip king

  ive done nothing outside the law if i

start running now before being accused ill
have to duck and run all my life

  theyre coming thought i had more

of a lead stay inside tersely directed
whip king

  he pulled his black slouch hat well for-
ward stepped out and closed the door and
leaned against the logs

  fifty men were streaming up the slope
the foremost being within derringer range
it was more ominous that they came in
silence they halted a rod from the hut and
eyed whip king curiously the leader in-
formed

  were the latest improvement com-
mittee in oro city whip king were
looking for nate goss

  hes at home and well tom cameron
hes my friend what do you folks think
to do with him

  improve him cried a man

  several smiled grimly

  thats no talk to make to a friend of
nate goss said whip king hes a
gambler but hes a square one you can
drag him from that shack and kill him but
hell take a lot of you along with him be-
ing his friend i shall have to stand by him
and get killed and i shall take a few with
me even if i be a great lover of peace
spose you men let cameron do the talking
for you and leave out the war talk

  cameron who had been in colorado city
two years and whose union ranch fifteen
miles from oro city was a well known
stopping-place for travelers quietly ex-
plained 

  the boys are getting tired of the way
things are going in the gulch being in
town and being impartial they asked me
to take a hand theyll keep shut and i
will do the talking the solid men in the
mountains never intended to have any such
doings that have disgraced the camps in
california and nevada

  the montana diggings have called most
of our bad characters away and weve got
along quite decent now a mans been
murdered its known he was in with the
gang plastering the towns with worthless
money many believe the man who did the
killing was one of the gang i dont know
nothing about that that young man has
skipped before any one accused him it
looks like he was guilty he slept in this
hut the last time he was here at least he
pards



was sent here by goss to sleep the boys
say goss ran here and warned him to
run so now some are thinking goss was
in the crooked game the committee
is determined to smooth out these bad
places

  ill be glad to join your committee
heartily agreed whip king the boy lit
out and you say his going looks like he was
guilty thats why goss wouldnt run
when he had word from me you was coming
he stayed to face the music ill be glad to
join your committee if every accused man is
given a square shake

  well you dont see any ropes and we
aint waving any guns patiently replied
cameron but if a shots fired from that

hut well blow it plumb to- and the

man in it

  you ought to with so big an outfit
warmly agreed whip king

  the long and short of it is this-goss
must clear out at once not a hand will be
raised against him if he goes promptly
whip king relaxed the door behind
him opened and goss stepped out his hands
empty

  i never stayed where i am not wanted
he told the crowd i was ready to go
after that trouble with dodge after he
ran away i was made to understand i was
welcome to stay theres quite a number
of cardmen in oro slabtown and malta
you wont drive them all away youll
want some to stay to give you a play when
you feel lucky as to knowing anything
about counterfeit money-thats a lie im
a gambler thats the worst any one can
say of me skillings belonged to the gang
passing counterfeit money i detested the
man if crooked i wont travel with such
cattle

  the singing waiter killed skillings last
night you sent him up here to sleep
the boys say you warned him to light out
explained cameron its along of those
things and not because youre a gambler
that your rooms are wanted in place of your
company

  it was on goss tongue to say rabbit in-
duced ellis to run away but second thought
convinced him he would be making serious
trouble for the indian for the same reason
he refrained from repeating the hunters
assertion that a white man but not ellis
killed skillings

  theres some two thousand men down

below who are talking through cameron
cried one of the committee

  im going reminded goss but its
idiotic for anyone to think the pilgrim would
kill a man and then come back here and go
to sleep

  no one says he went to sleep sharply
corrected cameron but it would be
pretty slick of him to make believe he was
asleep if hed done that and was found
making believe sleep the boys might have
been fooled

  all right im through i have several
business matters to attend to and dont wish
to leave until early evening i suppose
thats satisfactory

  any shooting or knifing business sus-
piciously asked a citizen

  goss shook his head and assured

  only a quarter interest in a claim thats
refused to pan out i may find some one
foolish enough to buy it a few bills to pay
and a few debts to collect sunrise will not
find me here

  thats reasonable agreed cameron
you should have time to settle your affairs
but be out of the gulch before sunup well
pass word below to that effect

  and he turned and led the committee
down the slope

  peace corral again heads of cattle all
facing out from the circle murmured whip
king mopping his head with a red handker-
chief but wherell you go

 canon city denver dont know
which yet first i shall go to see the sing-
ing pilgrim

  he rapidly related what the indian had
told him

  whip king was apprehensive lest some
one from the gulch stumble upon ellis
hiding place the gambler was quite con-
fident the indian had hidden him dis-
cretely

  rabbit and i agree it might be well to
smuggle the pilgrim out of the mountains
and back east in your next wagon train
that could be done readily agreed
whip king but i wont be returning to
the river until after the season closes if
he stops singing he can stay in denver all
right you can write to me at the broad-
well house if i aint there the clerk will
send it after me

  youre not traveling entirely at random
then remarked goss

  whip king shook his head


adventure

  just looking round to see if itll pay
another season to freight direct to the camps
instead of reshipping from denver ive
gone direct to buckskin ought to be able
to deliver direct to other camps wed
better be going

  goss turned back into the hut long
enough to pocket several tin-types and make
a roll of his blankets as they walked down
the slope whip kang asked

  what can i do to help you expecting
any mail

  no mail if any comes for the pilgrim
-ellis is his name-tell them to forward it
to the broadwell house scarcely any one
here knows his name im making a call at
the express office now to see if he has a
letter find the indian and tell him to
look for me there or at londoners store
tell him im run out and will go with him
tonight

 youve got to have a hoss oughter to
have two

  i can pick them up down below prob-
ably at camerons

  as they entered the straggling street
curious glances were cast at goss and his
dark face flushed he knew word had
passed that he was run out his blanket
roll advertised his departure but after
they had reached the express office and had
decided it would be better for wtiip king to
ask for mail under the name of ellis excited
voices began calling down the street

  no mail snapped whip king darting
from the office but whats up now
must be bringing in the pilgrim mut-
tered goss

  dont sound like that something big
has happened probly big war news

  the excitement spread up the street and
engulfed them

    sioux have broken out loudly shouteda
man

  people poured from huts and tents
questions came so fast as to be unintelli-
gible the man mounted a drygoods box
and waved his hands for silence then he
announced

  word has just been received that the
sioux have declared war and are raiding the
whole frontier minnesota is overrun and
all settlers killed who have not escaped to
the mississippi minneapolis is burning
the nebraska border has been pushed back
all the plains tribes will join in it means
well be cut off from the east well be

attacked if our troops aint sent back here
from missouri

  although greatly exaggerated as to the
success of the outbreak in minnesota and
the number of bands or tribes turning
hostile the street orators lurid announce-
ment was accepted at face value colo-
rados position was peculiarly dangerous and
the far-sighted were fearing what they be-
lieved must come soon a general uprising
of the plains indians

  even though the red forces were success-
fully stood off from denver and valley
towns the mountain camps must be aban-
doned should the utes join hands with the
plains tribes

  the greatest hardship would be the pri-
mary question of food already a delay in
wagon trains making denver meant a boost
in prices with an indian war to blockade
the freight trains there would be danger of
starvation gulch merchants who heard
the dire prophecy darted back into their
stores and began marking up their goods
goss smiled grimly and observed

  about the only one to draw an ace out of
this mess is the pilgrim- every one will be
shy about wandering around looking for
him im going to londoners store if
you see the rabbit send him to me there

a red curtain was strung along
the eastern skyline as goss and
the rabbit ended their fifteen-
mile walk through the darkness
and left the treeless valley to enter among
pine-covered hills the first rays of the
morning sun lighted a desolate stretch of
dead trees skeleton forms grim and fan-
tastic the rabbit said the trees were
killed by elk eating the bark and often
girdling a trunk

  they passed through this dismal grove
and came to another that was orderly in its
green dress this was the last barrier be-
tween them and the shore of the lower of the
twin lakes a wonderful emerald nearly
four miles long and more than a mile wide at
its greatest width here was peace and
quiet and goss wished to halt and rest

  the singing man is at the upper end
explained the rabbit as he continued to
lead the way

  he kept on and goss limped after him for
three miles when they halted it was close
to the narrow barrier a twenty-foot-high
bank which all but separated the upper from
pards

the lower lake there was an inch of snow
in red mountain pass a few miles up
the canon beyond the lakes but here at the
edge of the pine growth the sun was warm
with the mellowness of indian summer

  the gambler lost no time in pulling off his
boots and socks and bathing his aching feet
in the cold water glacier ice had once filled
the two depressions now made beautiful by
mountain lakes goss was admiring the
reflections of mountain heights in the per-
fect mirror when the rabbit gave a low call
very soon ellis came running along the
shore and shouted with gladness on recog-
nizing the gambler

  seizing goss hand he shook it convul-
sively and exclaimed

  lord but ive been lonesome too
lonesome almost to eat thought the rab-
bit would never come never dreamed you
would be with him at the best i only
looked for some word from you some bit of
advice its mighty good of you to look me
up

  youre sizing up the draw entirely
wrong wearily corrected goss they
ran me out of camp had to go somewhere
came here well find horses at camer-
ons ranch and travel easier

  any letters for me

  goss shook his head and proceeded to re-
sume his socks and boots much of the
joyousness vanished from ellis face and it
was a minute before he requested details of
what had happened in the gulch while
the hunter was making a fire the gambler
crisply related all that had happened in oro
city

  it was the finding of the counterfeit
money that started me walking

  its all on account of me ellis mourn-
fully regretted ive brought you bad
luck

  goss believed in good and bad luck and
he winced at the speech in his mind was
being born the fear that association with
the pilgrim would mean a continuation of
bad luck yet he endeavored to make his
voice hearty as he insisted

  my game was about played out there
skillings was the man who brought me bad
luck that counterfeit money was the last
straw do you know who killed skill-
ings

  not an idea the rabbit woke me up
in your shack and told me i had to run i
was not entirely awake until we were well

down the gulch then i wanted to go
back during the whole trip i believed i
was acting foolish id done nothing
then it was too late to turn back after he
left me here yesterday it seemed as if id go
crazy from worry and loneliness now
youre dragged into the mess

  you didnt drag me in curtly replied
goss i was told to get out after my
trouble with dodge then he ran away and
i was allowed to stick but folks remem-
bered it it came easier for them to tell me
to go the second time yet if they hadnt
found that imitation money i could have
finished the season

  no ones shedding tears over skillings
some would like to have him back to hang
him thats all but someone started the
yarn you must have been in cahoot with
him and it was known you went to my
cabin i was blamed for running ahead of

the mob to warn you the-fools i

nearly broke my feet hurrying through the
darkness to get you and fetch you to the
wagons

  just as i said its all along of me
oh well the camps about played out
placer mining has seen its rosiest days in
colorado if they dont learn how to
handle the quartz these mountains will be
dead inside of another year or two want
to go with me to denver whip king will
take you back east in one of his wagon
trains

  ellis rested his elbows on his knees and
pressed his hands against his head in a
scarcely audible voice he answered 

  to think this is the end of all my high
plans cant even stay and try what
will she think

  meaning your sister i suppose she
wont blame you youre not to blame
oh she would never blame me no
matter what i did she wouldnt blame me
but it all means well lose our place
raised money on it you know god help
us

  too big a medicine to be wasted on small
affairs growled goss why not help
yourself youve got your legs and arms
no ones taking your life youve got your

sister if i had a sister -of it is im

an only child quit sniveling and play
your hand

  all right goss youll hear no more
sniveling but i wont go back home if i
can stay out here without being hung
adventure

  no danger after a week or so oro men
are beginning to scatter folks in denver
arent interested in what happened in cali-
fornia gulch perhaps your luck will turn
by another season

  the rabbit announced the breakfast was
ready and they joined him at the edge of
the lake and close by the bank they made
a hearty meal of deer meat bread and coffee
after he had eaten and had lighted a cigar
goss mood improved he began to ap-
prove of their surroundings

  i havent taken a holiday for a long
time he remarked ill sleep part of the
day then well discuss plans for traveling
down the valley

  ellis face revealed his disappointment
of course you must sleep he agreed
i was forgetting you were up all night
and youre keen to be moving said the
gambler quick to read the tell-tale expres-
sion perhaps its as well ill snooze for
a couple of hours im used to being up
nights its my feet that bother the most
goss go back under the pines and
sleep the singing man will go with you
to keep watch spoke up the indian
some utes have been out down the val-
ley and stolen horses they may be com-
ing back this way ill scout around and
hunt for signs

  the hunter entered the timber the while
men at his heels goss threw himself down
and drew his soft hat over his eyes al-
most instantly he was asleep ellis sat be-
side him his mind open to homesickness and
despair dully wondering when and where it
would all end he was pressed down by
his failure more than by fear of california
gulch goss turned on his side and the
soft hat slipped from his face ellis was
seeing him for the first time with his dark
features relaxed and he was surprized to
observe how youthful the gambler looked to
be it was disquieting if not humiliating
to realize that one so little his senior could
be so direct and masterful so firmly en-
trenched in determination ellis had felt
a great fear of charley dodge goss had
sought him and conquered him

  at last ellis rose and wandered through the
growth to the lake where they had eaten
for some minutes he stood staring at the
mirrored mountains yet scarcely conscious
of beholding the inverted picture some
gravel rattled down the bank and at first
brought no significance to his mind when

he comprehended that something was alive
on top of the barrier he conquered his im-
pulse to glance up before him in the
emerald water stretched the wall separating
by a fourth of a mile the two lakes as he
stared he beheld a fringe of grotesque faces
peering down at him

  with a mighty effort he turned to the
right bringing his back to the barrier to
walk slowly to the pines to whistle softly as
he advanced was a fine test for his nerves
he fancied the savages were at his back yet
did not commit the fateful error of turning
his head he expected at each step to feel
the bite of an arrow or the benumbing shock
of a bullet yet he forced himself to whistle
and proceed with measured steps when
he knew he was out of sight of the lake he
bent low and ran softly over the brown
floor

  he reached goss and shook him gently
by the arm the gambler was instantly
awake and stretched his arms and yawned
and opened his mouth to speak but ellis
lightly placed a hand over his lips and
whispered

  row of indians along the high bank
didnt let on i saw them

   goss came to his feet and clapped on his
hat and felt for his two guns ellis rifle
was on the ground pointing to it the
gambler rolled his blankets and threw them
over his shoulder and whispered

  theyve come-down lake creek from
the west when you dont show up theyll
think you went toward the arkansas our
camp will tell them more than one man ate
there theyll wait a bit for all of us to
return well pass them by making west in
a wide circle

  and the rabbit

   he ought to be able to look after him-
self come

  they noiselessly threaded their way
deeper into the growth and down into a
gully striking into a game trail that ran
west they entered it and walked more
rapidly they passed beyond the upper
lake without seeing it and entered the nar-
row rugged valley of lake creek where the
stream brawled among huge boulders and
in one place passed under a natural
bridge

   forsaken looking spot ellis exclaimed
his gaze hopelessly wandering from the floor
of boulders to the well-defined water line
four hundred feet up the mountain side
pards



where the mighty predecessor of the two
lakes once washed the rock

  they stumbled on ellis often glanced
back at last goss pointed ahead to the
first of several patches of fair-sized pine
strung together with a scrub growth

  good cover if we had grub we could
stand off the whole ute nation in there
his assurance was born of optimism for in
their own rugged country the ute tribes
were a match for the bravest of the plains
indians they covered ten miles and finally
camped where the valley twisted toward the
southwest with the trail sloping sharply
upward to red mountain pass

  well starve prophesied ellis

  well sleep first declared goss

  do you suppose the rabbit can find us
asked ellis

  goss drew his hat over his face although
the sun could not find him in the thick cov-
ert and drowsily answered-

  fool to spend his time trying if he plans
on letting his own people shoot him next
june

chapter iv

the sentence of the pipe

early in the morning the two men
were up and wondering whence would
come their breakfast goss was moody and
grumbled at their plight he insisted they
should have remained at the lake and stood
off the utes if attacked ellis replied
youd be mighty glad youre here and
not down there if youd seen that string of
faces staring up out of the water painted
like so many---and as sly as panthers
they must be the band the rabbit said had
been stealing horses down the valley they
wouldnt hesitate to kill ill take my rifle
and follow this little creek south and see if
i can shoot some game

  weve lost the rabbit well be losing
ourselves yet said goss

  i cant get lost so long as i stick to this
creek from the south

  and i cant lose myself if i stick to the
main stream coming down from the moun-
tains added goss but it seems were
in a devil of a mess ill go up this trail and
get a look at the country maybe i can
pot some game with a hand-gun but dont
go far be back here in an hour

  the gambler had the worst of the travel-

ing as the upward trail was rough and zig-
zagged much in order to surmount an eight
hundred foot rise in less than twenty-five
hundred feet much water came out at the
foot of the mountain and in places the
ground was boggy he saw no game and
so arduous was the task of keeping to the
trail that he had scant time to play the
hunter

  when he halted disgusted with his errand
and inclined to blame ellis for their plight
he had an extended view of lake creek
valley it contained nothing to uplift his
moody spirits he pronounced it somber
and dreary the timber was poor and scat-
tering scrub willows grew thickly

  the occasional patches of grass were thin
and appeared to be dead while not versed
in woodcraft he knew it was no spot the
utes would select for a camp the trail
however indicated they traveled up and
down the narrow valley in fleeing he
and ellis had not got out of their path be-
set with the fear of being overtaken by the
utes he hurried down the trail intending
to follow the small creek south and find
ellis and inform him they must continue
traveling away from lake creek

  he had no love for wild scenery while
his vocation made him a silent reserved
man he was naturally gregarious in dis-
position he liked lights and crowds and
the risks of the gaming tables

  the descent to the mouth of the small
tributary was fully as tiresome as had been
the upward path his boots were filthy
with mud and his temper heated to a vicious
pitch his exasperation brought him to the
point where he would have welcomed a fight
with the utes and he almost believed he
would relish a quarrel with ellis his mood
greatly improved as he came to a halt and
beheld his companion riding toward him on
a decrepit pony and leading another

  the pilgrim has the luck he muttered
walks away on a blind chance and brings
back two ponies

  ellis waved his hand and tried to urge his
sorry mount into a gallop

  i found a beautiful little spot he cried
meadowland enclosed by mountains rich
grass ground as level as a floor i found
these ponies there and theres signs of
beaver im told theyre good to eat and
i saw grouse but didnt dare shoot

  is there a way out of the opening except
this stream


adventure

  i dont know but there must be said
ellis i didnt stop to explore the east
or south side but any creek flowing east
must empty into the arkansas and we can
follow it or we camp there till its safe
to come back this way and make the
arkansas

  the last is what we must do seasons
too short for greenhorns to go mooning
among the mountains if id traveled much
higher up the valley id found snow but
the first thing is to eat ill knock over
some grouse with my six-shooter doesnt
make as much noise as your rifle well
feed and rest for a day then well come
back here and utes or no utes well go back
to the lakes and down to the arkansas
this wild life isnt my game nor yours
still we have brains enough to accommodate
ourselves to it for a bit we wont have
to walk as long as those nags hold out

  he mounted the second pony and ellis
turned and led the way south the animals
showed no spirit and plodded along slowly
pausing to graze despite their riders kicking
heels having no bridles it was difficult
to guide the ponies and once goss had to
dismount and turn his steed around to keep
him from making for the lake creek valley

  as the way grew narrower and the thin
grass gave out the ponies walked more
briskly intent on reaching the succulent
feed of the opening below the walls of the
gulch approached closer together until the
way appeared to be a mere slit through the
towering rocks the morning light became
twilight and the gambler complained they
were entering a tunnel

  suddenly the brawling of the pent-in
creek ceased and goss was shielding his eyes
against the abrupt return of the sunlight
the cold dampness was succeeded by genial
warmth from the mouth of the gulch the
two were gazing on a small park roughly
round in shape with a small grassy hill rising
in the center through this level opening
the creek meandered placidly with willows
along the banks mirrored in the quiet
waters pines and spruce with soldierly
erectness covered much of the lower slopes
against the blue sky rubbed the bare rocks
already frosted with snow

  its a mighty fine layout exclaimed
goss looks tame enough down here
we have blankets and guns and ponies
point where i shall look for grouse and then
build a fire

  both dismounted and the ponies fell to
grazing on the rich grass ellis indicated
the nearest growth of evergreens and
directed

  along the edge they seem to be tame
goss started for the timber a revolver
in his hand inside of five minutes after
disappearing from his companions sight he
had shot two grouse and was proudly re-
turning to the creek they dressed and
broiled the birds and ate heartily although
they had no seasoning 

  id give five dollars for a pinch of salt
grumbled goss then after feeling in his
empty pocket he added id give a hun-
dred for a good cigar

  the lack of tobacco irritated him he
was for boldly making for the arkansas
absence of creature comforts and the un-
accustomed environment again worked him
up to the fighting edge he gave short an-
swers to ellis questions the latter having
troubles of his own was quick to resent this
treatment finally he decided

  were only two white men and this
seems to be quite a roomy place yet its
already too small for us im ready to start
back now better fight utes than to be
fighting each other

  theres no fight between us growled
goss at times my bark is worse than
my bite i feel ive hogged out of luck i
cant be agreeable even to myself whyn
-- dont you sing no dont itll make
me homesick if we can round up those
two bags of bones well start back fre-
mont had trouble somewhere in these moun-
tains and lost men and i never let on to
be smarter than fremonts guides

  all right well go back quite a ways
to come for our breakfast said ellis

  now that they were to make for civiliza-
tion goss quickly became more affable
he helped ellis catch the ponies which
were too feeble or lazy to evade them long
gathering up their blankets they armed
themselves with willow whips and urged
their mounts down the creek toward the
slot through the tall walls

  goss repeated his request for a song
declaring the danger of homesickness had
passed ellis willingly obliged and started
on westward ho he had finished the
first stanza when the gambler interrupted
him by pointing to the left and crying

  -me knew i was in for a stretch

of bad luck
pards



  ellis followed the direction of his hand
and discovered six mounted indians making
swiftly from the timber for the crack in the
wall ahead racing the savages for the
narrow exit was out of the question goss
even allowed his pony to halt and graze
were bottled up he muttered

  good- look behind cried ellis

  a dozen braves their long braids of hair
snapping behind them were riding down the
creek at a furious gallop

  there was no cover except the fringe of
willows along the stream goss slid to the
ground and rested the barrel of his gun
across the ponys back intending to utilize
the animal as breastwork against the in-
dians coming down the creek ellis imitated
his example but face the indians between
them and the exit from the park and aimed
his rifle on the leader

  a chorus of wild howls rose from both
galloping bands which not only startled the
stillness of the opening but incited the
ponies to bolt toward the spruce growth
the two men were left naked to the attack

the yelling suddenly ceased and
the two parties slowed down to
a walk from the larger band
i i  a rider detached himself and gal-
loped ahead his open hands held high in the
sign of friendship

  most of them have guns all of them
have bows and arrows said goss its
sure death if we fight yet im willing what
do you say

  theres my sister hoarsely replied
ellis i mustnt miss a chance to get out
alive and he lowered his rifle

  goss thrust his gun in his belt the two
bands kicked their ponies into a gallop and
with a wild flurry of hoofs quickly sur-
rounded the white men the leader who
had made the sign of peace flew from his
pony and ran to the prisoners his hands
open before him he kept repeating-

  good good

  then with a quick movement he snatched
ellis rifle away and almost at the same
time jerked the gamblers gun from its
holster

  immediately rough hands were laid on the
two and they felt nooses of horsehair ropes
around their necks their hands were tied
at their backs with loud whoops the entire
band started up the creek toward the south
as the prisoners desperately hurried along

to escape strangulation their captors would
scowl murderously and make threatening
gesture the man having goss in tow
pointed dramatically at the two broken-
down ponies and talked vehemently the
gambler shook his head to indicate he did
not understand

  ellis caught something of the pantomime
and told his companion-

  awful big fuss to make because we rode
a few miles on those castaway beasts

  the rope around his throat tightened and
cut off speech

  the way led to the southern end of the
park a distance of three miles and then
swerved abruptly to the right or west into
the mouth of a narrow gulch its presence
could not be suspected by a stranger until
he was close upon it the traveling grew
rougher the indians taking to the dned-up
bed of a mountain creek which was scat-
tered thickly with small and large boulders
only by the utmost agility did the white
men escape being dragged by the neck it
was evident the indians were not particu-
lar whether they took them along dead or
alive as no consideration was shown

  when goss managed to get a brief breath-
ing spell he choked

  well-their hides if id seen this

id made it a fightl

  were still alive reminded ellis muffled
voice

  for five or six miles they clambered and
bumped over and against the boulders
when they were on the point of exhaustion
their faces bleeding from abrasions the
gulch widened and debouched into a beauti-
ful park of about the same size as the one
where the capture was made there were
twenty or more skin lodges and the absence
of women and children indicated it was a
temporary settlement a hunting or war
camp

  a considerable herd of ponies was grazing
in the rich grass near the mouth of the gulch
from the lodges came the wailing of a single
voice but what interested the prisoners
now that the ropes were removed from their
necks was the sight of a white man sitting
on the right of their approach to the lodges
he was smoking a pipe and on discovering
the prisoners he jumped to his feet and ran
toward them calling out-

  who are you

  an indian struck at him with his bow and

smashed the head of the pipe the man


adventure

stared ruefully at the stem still held in his
fingers then picked up the bowl only to
drop it on satisfying himself it was hope-
lessly broken

  a ute unfastened the prisoners hands
and in pantomime promised to cut their
throats if they wandered near the outlet
finding themselves free they advanced to
the white man and goss announced

  were prisoners are you

  for two weeks if tlis isnt a pretty
mess he looked to be scarcely past his
majority he was slim of build and had
tousled light hair his blue eyes were
round and staring both goss and ellis
appraised him as being a bit simple-minded
his facial expression suggested perpetual
surprise

  the gambler gave his name and intro-
duced ellis as the singing pilgrim

  im called euclid because of my abstruse
calculations if these indians hadnt picked
me up id have revolutionized the process
of quartz mining before now

  lowering his voice as if fearing their
savage captors would understand he con-
fided

  by higher mathematics ive discovered
how to conquer sulfurets best stampers
now are saving only a fourth of the gold
the silver and copper are wasted our
miners cant seem to understand they must
do differentn than they do in california
where there is no refractory ore we lose
surface profits by trying to get rid of sul-
phurets by wrong methods we exhaust
the decomposed surface quartz in the first
year and then find ourselves in caps and
pinches and those abominable sulfurets
but with one sheet of paper and a lead

pencil ive discovered-

  we remarked were prisoners if youre
called euclid you must be the man whip
king was asking for in california gulch
said the last time he saw you you were
being mobbed in central city harshly
broke in goss

 they didnt understand at central city
wheres whip king now

  an indian darted forward and struck at
euclid viciously with a piece of firewood
the blow was dodged neatly but euclid
became silent and walked farther from the
lodges followed by goss and ellis none
of the indians followed them the wailing
from the camp grew more piercing euclid
whispered

  little tree father of red crow chief
of this band accidentally shot himself
through the breast with a revolver medi-
cine man is trying to cure him old fool
was pounding the butt against a rock wish
the whole tribe had caught the same bullet

  if theyve kept you alive two weeks
theres a chance for us hopefully said ellis

  oh im sure of it but im losing too
much time times money if they had
to catch a white man why did they have to
bag the best assayer in the mountains
in any mountains sighed euclid

  id hate to have such a poor opinion of
myself grunted goss

  euclid did not appear to sense any irony
he started to explain in detail the im-
portance of his work when the voice of the
medicine man abruptly ceased

  the old bucks dead whispered euclid
staring at the lodges

  the silence continued for a minute then
commenced much shouting and men began
running about one warrior ran to the
pony herd and called loudly to the guards
immediately three ponies were driven one
side and shot with arrows a fourth pony
was hurried to the camp men brought
out a blanket-wrapped form and placed it
on the pony a tall ute with many silver
ornaments decorating his two long braids of
hair walked toward the west side of the
park several men with the pony followed

  man going ahead is red crow son of
little tree the dead man muttered
euclid

  the lodge in which little tree died col-
lapsed and coals from a fire were thrown on
it until it began burning for the utes de-
stroy all property left by the dead when
the lodge poles and skin covering and few
furnishings had been reduced to ashes sev-
eral small trees were felled and dragged in
and dumped on the spot this so that no
man would erect his lodge there

  euclid fingered the stem of his pipe and
complained

  big fool busted my pipe now i cant
smoke

  queer that whip king should have
asked about you and that now i should
meet you mused the gambler

  whip king means well but hes narrow-
minded he doesnt comprehend that the
universe is simply a problem in celestial
mathematics and that if the great truth is
ever discovered it will be by my pencil and
pards



paper and not by digging up ruins and
preaching sermons

  why dont you try to think well of
yourself instead of always hooting at your-
self asked goss

four indians ran up to the pris-
oners and began pushing and
shoving them about and striking
them with their bows a red
man would have considered a blow from
a bow a deadly insult but the white men
were thankful clubs were not used fierce
gestures were made knives were thrust close
to their throats

  goss pressed his left arm against the gun
under his armpit and submitted with poor
grace to the tough treatment determined
to show no resentment unless attacked with
a mortal weapon ellis was alarmed
euclid appeared used to abuse

  the indians desisted and watched for the
return of the funeral procession a shot
was heard the men came back without
the pony they had killed the animal close
by the grave of its owner little tree was
something that never had existed he
would not be mentioned in any conversa-
tion nor were there any of his personal
effects in existence to recall his memory
so it was with all the utes but if property
could not be inherited it could be and was
given away before death as the men
entered the camp with red crow in the
lead the white men were subjected to more
mauling

  they act as if we were to blame for the
old fellows death muttered euclid as their
tormentors finally finished their abuse and
hurried to the lodges

  goss picked up his soft hat and brushed
it carefully smoothed his hair and stared
after the men with death in his gaze he
believed he would have opened fire on them
with the unsuspected revolver had it not
been for the presence of ellis

  euclid sucked at the pipe-stem and mur-
mured

  superstition destroying property or
maybe theyre wisern white folks no
waiting around for a man to die so you can
step into his shoes by mathematics-

  shut up you make my head ache
growled the gambler

  whered you see old whip king still
freighting i suppose said euclid

  it was ellis who gratified his curiosity

and mentioned some of the happenings in
california gulch for the gambler was sub-
merged in murderous meditations and never
shifted his baleful gaze from the group of
indians

  i heard something about charley dodge
when i was up in the gregory diggings
remarked euclid pretty reckless sort of
a man folks dont like to cross him
goss here made him back down come
near killing him proudly informed ellis

  the utes now advanced in a body upon
the prisoners and goss stood up and pressed
down on the hidden gun his depressed
cheeks and high cheek bones giving him a
profile that was suggestive of indian blood
his right hand held the lapel of his coat
ready to dart inside the coat and draw the
revolver

  this time however the utes halted near
the prisoners and red crow began to ad-
dress them hi eyes were venomous and
while none of the prisoners understood a
word of his talk it was apparent he was
denouncing them the warriors behind and
on both sides of him listened to his speech
in ferocious impatience and fingered their
clubs and knives and short-handled axes as
if waiting for some word

  i shall take five or six with me the
gambler muttered from the corner of his
mouth go down fighting

  red crow suddenly ceased talking and
began lifting his hand his men leaned for-
ward as if waiting for the word that would
release them from the lower end of the
park sounded a shrill ululating cry the
chiefs hand halted half-raised and he and
his men shifted their gaze in the direction
of the interruption a small band of
mounted indians were rapidly galloping up
the park and the leader commenced shout-
ing and waving his arms

  ellis standing at the gamblers shoulder
tremulously whispered-

  the second man is the rabbit

  euclid exclaimed

  thank the lord here comes the white
chief of the utes i promised to help him
make a million from placer diggings he
knows about

  the tableau persisted while the returning
band came up at a smashing gallop driving
a dozen riderless horses before it then the
tensity of red crows men relaxed and they
began shouting salutations to the new-
comers they expressed much joy on being


adventure

told in turn of thesuccessful raid down the
arkansas valley as the mounted men
leaped to the ground and joined the group
around red crow the latter dropped his
hand and listened to the leaders talk in
moody silence

  goss and ellis were amazed when the
rabbit gave no sign of recognizing them
the gambler was first to take the cue and
warned ellis

  doesnt want them to know he knows
us dont speak to him

  the leader of the horse thieves entered
into earnest conversation with red crow
and as he talked he nodded several times
toward euclid goss studied the heavily
painted face and noted the broken nose and
light yellowish eyes and smiled grimly no
amount of paint or indian toggery could
conceal from him the fact the man was
born white

  the rabbit showed no interest in the
scene his dark face was as expressionless
as a piece of quartz as he stared steadily at
the angry countenance of red crow as
a result of the white chiefs talk red crow
betrayed indecision his men too re-
flected his state of mind the most of them
put up their knives and axes and lowered
their clubs

  red crow said something that switched
the renegades gaze to the rabbit the
latter muttered something and the white
chief was inspired to make another short
speech when he finished red crow turned
on his heel and walked to the lodges fol-
lowed by his men the white chief dis-
missed his followers with a few words and
with the rabbit remained with the prisoners
goss greeted-

  hello lomsom

  with a white mans oath the painted
leader advanced a step and thrust a hand
roughly under the gamblers chin and glared
into his eyes

  - you goss i dont know as id

have talked so strong if id seen it was you
he exclaimed

  im not to blame if you had to fight
out from salt lake city quietly replied
goss i never looked over your shoulder
to give your hand away you can call them
back and give them a different talk but
dont bring the pilgrim here into it as you
cant hold any grudge against him be-
sides hes wanted for killing a man in cali-
fornia gulch

  this gruesome endorsement permitted
ellis to gain some favor in lomsoms esti-
mation euclid earnestly added

  both these men are my friends chief
what happens to one must happen to all
of us

  close your meat-trap growled lom-
som but he squatted on the ground and
his eyes lost some of their ferocity goss
youre a gambler you never crossed my

trail but the sight of your - smooth

face makes me remember salt lake city
porter rockwell the huntington brothers
bill hickman and more of that kind who
would-a liked to seen me cut off behind my
ears then again if i ever dare break
away from these injuns itll be some one
like you wholl know me and give me
away

  no i wouldnt have given you away
if wed met in any of the camps too many
men are walking around out here in broad
daylight who are known to be killers for
me to start in naming them just now im
in a bad mess trying to save the pilgrim here
whos wanted for killing a hotel man in
california gulch

  this confession seemed to remove the last
of lomsoms animosity and suspicion

  that sounds all right he admitted
but im hunted i quit the danites and
theyd like to take a whack at me then
some folks seem to think i knifed a wagon
train man with gentiles and mormons
wanting my hair im likely to feel the
pinchers nipping the only safe place for
me to sleep in is a ute camp i lead a small
band of young men who dont take to old
ouray and his eastern ways i dont dare
to leave the mountains

  ride over the range north to the beaver
head country or the snake river camps or
to nevada youll never be bothered

euclid his round eyes try-
ing to grow even larger shrilly
broke in

  some would call it coincidence
the way you two old friends meet here but
theres no such thing as chance your meet-
ing here is one of the many million little
factors in the eternal equation theres no
reason why you shouldnt tell the indians
to let these men go free

  lomsom laughed sardonically and re-
plied-

  i spos their taking and riding two
pards



sacred or medicine ponies is all smoothed
out by your way of figuring

  the prisoners stared at him blankly he
tersely explained

  goss and this other feller are facing
death for riding the medicine-ponies early
in the summer red crow was cornered by
some kiowas at the edge of the plains he
said hed give two ponies to the bad god
if his hide was saved mighty big thunder
storm and cloudburst nearly drowned him
and the kiowas but he got clear he kept
his word and gave the ponies qf course
no one must ever strike or ride them goss
and this other feller rode them and kicked
them thats enough to settle their hash
in any ute camp now the bad god will

raise-with red crow

  but they are such poor ponies pror-
tested ellis

  that dont make any difference angrily
retorted lomsom mebbe the bad god
is rather foolish and accepts crow-bait for
real hossflesh but that dont change the
fact you two have done a very bad thing in
riding and striking them

  that can be fixed said goss you
give red crow two of the american horses
you brought in he can give two more
ponies to the bad god that ought to
square the deal

  yah-h id look fine giving away hoss-
flesh that i traveled way down to beaver
creek to lift snarled lomsom

  speaking for the first time the rabbit
curtly advised--

  give the horses to save these two men
lomsom stared at him wrathfully and
warned

  youre red and may have a pull with the
utes but im the white chief they
might take a notion to tie you to a ponys
heels

  the rabbit smiled slightly and replied

  i know the utes better than you do
ive met and talked with many of them
while out hunting they call me the walk-
ing dead man for they know i have only
until june first to live no ute will place a
hand on me no matter what i do they
would as quick think of striking a ghost
chief give the horses urged euclid
if you dont i wont use my calculations
on your secret diggings

  you round-faced fool gritted lomsom
even now they want to skin you alive for
killing little tree father of red crow

they believe a white stranger always brings
a bad spirit to a camp or village little
tree dies while youre here he was sick
before these other two men came in youve
no time to think about saving any one but
yorself

  the rabbit said

  it is true they believe a white man brings
a bad spirit to a village but what if some
one should tell them that lomsom a white
man driven out of a mormon city because
he had a bad spirit always at his side
brought death to little tree what if the
walking dead man whose voice is that of
a ghost should ask them to look back over
the time youve lived with them they
might find several deaths to be blamed
to you

  lomsoms lips twitched and he hoarsely
exclaimed

  im red i aint white

  they will listen very hard to what the
walking dead man says call your own
men and tell them to kill me no one will
lift a hand

  whats to stop me lifting a hand against
you cried lomsom

  fear of death you love life or you
wouldnt five with the utes red crow
would be the first to try for your life
lomsom drew a deep breath and sullenly
surrendered i aint narrer i aint got
anything against goss or the young pup
with him ill give the two hosses to red
crow i can steal some more but if i
do that you must talk strong to save this
other feller whose blamed for little trees
death im banking on him to clean up
enough gold to take me far from here

  if i had a dredge i could take millions
out of the twin lakes sands mused
euclid

  ill be glad to help the young man
readily agreed the rabbit well go and
have a talk now before red crow stirs up
more trouble

  all right for the pilgrim to sing asked
goss i feel like some music

  bleat his head off if he wants to
growled lomsom

  ellis was in no mood for singing but goss
insisted and as lomsom and the rabbit
made for the southern side of the camp they
were followed by the pathos and melody of
my old kentucky home lomsom
halted and looked back for a few moments
the effect on euchd was most pronounced


adventure

he stared at ellis as if under a spell and
when the song was finished he jumped to
his feet declaring

  thats singing got to smoke on that
you ought to get a job at denver singing
no not at singing mumbled ellis with
a frightened side-glance at goss

  hes been blamed for killing a skunk he
never harmed explained the gambler
hes known as the singing pilgrim best
for him not to sing in denver for a season
at least

  anyway its prime music lets stretch
our legs no one will notice so long as we
dont go near the pony herd

  ellis was willing gross fished a deck of
cards from his pocket and decided to re-
main where he was and play solitaire
euclid led the way to the lodges explaining
im bound to have a smoke you saw
that red beast smash my pipe but i
know where theres others lots of them
indian pipes

  he halted before a large lodge and pulled
back the entrance flap there were no
blankets in the place nor any other signs
of it being used as a habitation except the
several pipes hanging from the center pole
ellis did not wish to enter he feared it
would be intruding

  euclid assured him

  ive learned a lot about indians youre
expected to walk in where you want to
when im hungry i go into any lodge and
squat indians dont know anything about
ringing doorbells or knocking go where
you want to its their way i know a lot
about them

  as he talked he stepped inside ellis
with some misgivings followed him euclid
further explained

  as i make it out this is sort of a club
room free to every one indians meet
here and talk over things funny lot of
trash they cart around

  and he nodded toward a buffalo robe on
which was the painted skull of a buffalo a
horn from a mountain sheep that measured
three feet in length and was nearly five
inches through at the base some curious
rocks and a miscellany of other objects

  while his companion was examining the
pipes ellis examined the medicine collection
more carefully and became interested in a
small stone statue while ignorant of the
red mans ways he knew the little idol was
beyond the utes culture plane he de-

cided itwas of aztec origin meanwhile
euclid selected a pipe with a long and
decorated stem and quickly filled the bowl
with tobacco

  he puffed contentedly curious about
the statue ellis took it to the opening the
better to examine it euclid followed him
mumbling

  this draws bettern the pipe the indians
busted stems too long though to handle
easy if the stem was shorter id take it
even-stephen

  the rabbit appeared between two lodges
and on beholding them halted in amazed
horror then he was fiercely commanding
fools come out of that medicine
lodge put that pipe back knock the
tobacco from it  youre stepping over your
own souls quick before you are seen
both intruders were alarmed by the in-
tense earnestness of the indian ellis
dropped the small statue in his pocket and
darted from the entrance the rabbit ges-
tured for him to get clear of the camp
euclid inside the lodge lost no time in
emptying the bowl of tobacco and returning
the pipe to its thong on the centerpole
he was nervous and alarmed but not to the
extent of ellis fright when he emerged
from the lodge the rabbit had vanished
gone to meet and hold back any utes re-
turning from the conference

  ellis slowed his pace when clear of the
lodges and on seeing euclid coming he
halted and waited for him

  im scared he greeted we were fools
to go nosing in that place

  seems an awful row to make over a
smoke in an empty skin hut growled eu-
clid now beginning to feel ashamed over
his display of alarm

  when the rabbit speaks like that he
means it whispered ellis

  no harm done none of the beggars
saw us i supposed it was all right to go
into any lodge seems that place is an
exception

  no need to tell goss hell think were
fools said ellis

  they joined the gambler and for some
minutes watched his game of solitaire be-
fore the utes swarmed back into their camp
lomsoms offer of two american horses to
take the place of the medicine-ponies no
longer acceptable to the malign spirit was
accepted it was necessary however to
make new medicine to propitiate the evil
pards



agency for the vitiation of the first gift
while they were busy with this rite in the
raedicine-lodge the rabbit hastened to join
the prisoners

  goss finished his game and as he shuffled
the cards he glanced up and remarked
didnt stay long find your pipe
euclid shook his head the gambler be-
gan a new game the rabbit halted be-
hind him and stood with head tilted as if
fearing to hear a menacing outburst after
a minute or two of tense waiting he relaxed
and remarked-

  i believe everything is all right for
the gamblers benefit he explained

  ive talked them out of thinking any
white man caused little trees death and
they have agreed to take two horses in place
of the ponies if nothing else bad hap-
pens-

  he never completed the sentence a wild
outcry from the camp brought goss to his
feet part of the cards in his hands the rest
spread out on the ground

  now what has happened he began
stuffing the cards in his pocket and jerking
his left shoulder and arm to loosen the hidden
gun in the armpit holster

  the rabbit drew a deep breath and
warned-

something very bad has happened
the cards havent run good at all
havent got it once moodily remarked
goss as he stooped and picked up the cards
on the ground

  euclid was worried but insisted

  theyre always howling about some-
thing just some of their heathenish ways
we folks from the east have read so much
about the taciturnity of the red man that
we expect their villages to be like ceme-
teries ive learned there isnt any place
noisier than an indian village when the
women and children are present it must be
as noisy as a fourth of july

i his words dwindled into silence
as with a still more ferocious
clamor the utes came swarming
from the lodges leaping high and
brandishing weapons racing desperately
to keep in the lead was lomsom with a
final burst of speed he came up to the
hunter and prisoners and hoarsely cried

  good- what have you fools done

  goss stared in bewilderment the rabbit
said

  

  they are very hard to keep alive and
there was dismay in his dark face any
other pipe but the medicine pipe

  but how can they tell no one saw us
cried euclid

  the rabbit frowned for silence for now
the utes were close at hand and red crow
was holding up the long-stemmed pipe his
savage face reflecting fear as well as rage
as he shouted something

  lomsom in an unsteady voice inter-
preted-

  he asks which of you smoked the janedi-
cine-pipe

  neither of us answered euclid his
round face and round blue eyes expressing
astonishment

  no good to tell him that muttered
lomsom theres some trade tobacco in
it and the bowl is still warm and theres
the smell of tobacco in the lodge one of
you has cooked his own goose

  euclids innocent face became sickly
white but he promptly said

  i smoked it indian busted my pipe
wanted a smoke thought it was all right
lomsom darted a glance at the scowling
utes none had understood the low-
spoken confession the renegade firmly be-
lieved euclid possessed knowledge of miner-
als that would permit him to find fortunes
where the ordinary placer miner could not
make bacon and beans in his journeyings
through the mountains the white chief
had examined many bars and gulches and
believed he knew of several that were bo-
nanza rich he needed the wisdom of eu-
clid in order to accumulate riches

  he would need he believed much gold
before venturing on a far flight

  california gulch had panned out very
rich but he knew that of all the thousands
who had entered and frightened the game
from the thickets of aspens there were only
a few who had made a strike now he
lomsom mormon apostate and slayer of a
sleeping wagon train man was confident he
could gather millions in gold if he could keep
the eccentric euclid as advisor he turned
to red crow and rapidly announced

  the young white man brought in with
the medicine-ponies smoked the medicine-
pipe

  none of the prisoners knew he had sen-
tenced ellis to a horrible death the rab-
bit did not enlighten them stepping in
front of ellis he warned-


adventure

  this must be talked

  the utes pressed closer and red crow
harshly warned

  only death can stop the bad medicine
from hurting us does the walking dead
man forget he hunts game in our country
and we are his friends does he now
hunt for death knowing he must soon
die

  he can not die until after new grass
grows again quietly replied the rabbit

he has said he would be with his deople
on a day named until that day he comes
and goes like a ghost and can not be hurt
let him talk with the white man alone it
is bad to smoke a medicine-pipe when not
making medicine for the utes but the talk
with the white man will be short red
crows men are near

  the rabbits position among the moun-
tain indians was unique he was a hostage
to death he would be claimed by death
in the coming summer for a man white
or red to anticipate the sentence-day would
be to invoke the hostility of death red
crow glanced at his followers and read a
surly acquiescence in their eyes he bowed
his head and tossed a pebble forty feet away
to indicate where the rabbit should briefly
confer with the prisoner

  the rabbit knew euclid had no suspicion
that the blame was shifted to ellis he was
surprized when ellis not himself was mo-
tioned to step aside goss was worried
although understanding nothing of the brief
talk between the hunter and the chief he
started to follow his friend red crow
sternly ordered him back the rabbit in-
stead of interpreting announced

  he shall stand by his friend while i
talk lomsom started to join them fear-
ing the rabbit would reveal his duplicity
but the hunter in english warned him
keep back you have talked enough
but be ready to help one shall not die
alone

  see here euclid demanded of the rene-
gade whats all this talk about theyre
not planning any mischief to that fellow
are they are they still yapping about
that pipe i said i smoked it what
of it

  shut up im trying to save your hide
thats what its about that young fool
rode a medicine-pony and the indian hunter
is trying to save his pelt hoarsely growled
lomsom

  you make sure the three of us get clear
of this muss or your gold diggings wont do
you any good warned euclid for he was
far from satisfied with the renegades ex-
planation remember you cant tell silver
from lead nor gold from iron pyrites its
my clear dry process or nothing

  lomsom savagely muttered the white
mans oaths and stared dubiously at the
three men now halting to confer

  the rabbit began to talk by abruptly
saying to ellis

  you are in bad trouble some sha-
man laid down a blue path for you and you
followed it into the medicine lodge it was
very bad to go in it was death to touch
things

  ellis felt ill and weakly defended i
never thought to fetch it away you or-
dered us out so sharp i didnt think to put
it back

  for-s sake whats all this about

fiercely asked goss

  the rabbit stared curiously at ellis and
noted the furtive move of a hand to a coat
pocket he murmured

  you are blamed for smoking the medi-
cine-pipe thats very bad business
what do you mean by bringing something
away

  the little stone doll i was looking at
it when you told us to quit that place i
was so mixed up i dropped it in my
pocket

  the tribal medicine of the uncompahgre
utes hissed the hunter you have
taken that away

  in my pocket now mumbled ellis
with a little gesture of despair the rabbit
said-

  even ouray couldnt save you

  hold on cried goss i take it the
pilgrim has made a fool play but im
backing him to the limit i can still bite
those redskins may rake in the pot but
itll cost them a lot of chips

  he slipped a hand inside his coat

  you have not the red mind you do
not understand said the rabbit if you
have a pistol hidden under your coat save a
bullet for your friend and one for yourself
then he reverted to the phraseology of the
cherokee shamans and softly lamented
he had stepped over his own soul he
has put it under the earth to be covered
with a black rock he is nearer the dark-
ening land than i am he will enter
pards



among the black houses of the darkening
land ahead of me

  this was spoken in english ellis sick
at heart had nothing to say goss stoutly
insisted

  not by a- sight until weve had a

play for our money i wont chase a pair
of deuces into the grave but ill try a bluff
he has that stone god in his pocket and
they dont know its missing its valu-
able to them

  the navahos had it from old mexico
and they prospered until they lost it the
apaches got it and they won many fights
and stole many horses and women then
the uncompahgre utes got it and they have
held these mountains against all the plains
indians replied the rabbit

  it was evident his white education had
not in the least weakened his belief in the
efficacy of the small squat idol

  glad to hear it said goss looks
like we had something to swap if we can
cold-deck them go ahead rabbit and
give us a talk you keep your arms folded
pilgrim

  my father and grandfather were sha-
mans when my people lived east of the
mississippi muttered the rabbit i will
use our medicine white man but it may not
work against a red medicine to help a white
man hayil yu-listen

  he lifted his head and in a loud sing-song
called on the elemental gods of his people
he invoked the aid of uktena the great
horned serpent of the terrapin the hawk
and the dog the power of his gods having
no relation to the size of their earthly re-
flections he appealed to the spider as ear-
nestly as he did to unelanuhi-the sun
he called on the moon

  as his red religion was zootheistic the
greater number of gods summoned to give
aid were animals he omitted fish and in-
sect gods as being subordinate and the
situation was too desperate to depend on
aught but the mightiest agencies nor did
he appeal to the stone god although it was
a major spirit among the few inanimates

  he could not trust this deity inasmuch
as it was invoked only for finding what was
lost not only would it smack of sacrilege
to petition a god bound to be in sympathy
with the medicine represented by the stone
idol but there was the danger of it function-
ing to discover the lost medicine even
though he did not call on it to help

    at last he had finished and
    sp his face was wet with sweat as
    vr he ceased staring at the heav-
    ens the utes motionless had

watched him with great respect surely
one who was sold to death to be delivered
on day named would be mightily protected
until the fatal hour overtook him to cut
him off before his time would be to meddle
with a terrible medicine and invite a terrible
punishment ellis stood with arms folded
his eyes staring at the cherokee like one
under a spell goss told the hunter
thats a strong talk it ought to fetch
the dust to our side of the table he no
longer has the little doll you get their
eyes off me and ill hide it after its hid-
den you can offer to trade the pilgrims
life for a return of the thing

  i can keep them from him till night
said the rabbit when you nod your
head i will know it is put away in a dark
place do not tell me where

  the rabbit and ellis walked back to the
utes and the former announced to red
crow

  this is no place for a medicine-talk
i have much to tell you we will go to the
medicine-lodge the white man shall go
with us

  goss was strolling aimlessly toward a
clump of timber no one gave any heed to
him red crow did not approve of the
hunters suggestion the jnedicine-lodge
had been desecrated enough he insisted
we will go under the trees and talk
bring the white man there

  he led the way to a pine grove where his
followers quickly formed a circle goss
stood on the outside of the circle and on
catching the hunters eye removed his hat
and nodded slightly then he sat down
on the ground beside lomsom the latter
bitterly complained-

  whyn - the young fools have to

touch that pipe

  my friend did not touch it corrected
the gambler it was your man

  tother feller cant prove that said
lomson

   i dont think hell try

  lomsom was puzzled and suspiciously
asked-

  what game be you up to nate goss
its a good game and -- help you if
you try to foul my hand warned the
gambler


adventure

  youre up to some funny business
muttered the renegade but high talk to
me is out of place in a ute camp id see
both youn your friend snagged before id
let them rub euclid out im hanging my
hat on him to help me get lots of gold
and i tell you its both or neither the
rabbit will tell red crow you lied if it
comes to a showdown keep shut

  the rabbit had taken a position opposite
to red crow and had ellis on one side and
euclid on the other after a few minutes
of silence the chief stood up and said

  the walking dead man has something
to tell us before the smoker of the pipe be-
comes a ghost the uncompahgre men
would not stop to listen to another man
we must listen to the walking dead man
he counts the moons of his life on his fin-
gers he is almost a ghost our ears are
open

  after a brief pause the rabbit rose and
began

  a long time ago ta-vi-the sun god-
went over the lands of the uncompahgre
utes by different trails sometimes he
came too near and burned the grass and
dried up the rivers sometimes he was
lazy and hid in a cave and the land grew
cold and the snow was deep and the utes
had hard work to keep alive

  then ta-vi came close and burned ta-
wats the hare god who was sleeping on
the grass ta-wats was angry and fought
for a long time with ta-vi and beat him
then ta-vi said he would stop coming too
near and hiding too long in holes and would
cross the land of the utes by the same trail
every day the utes know when it will be
cold and when it will be warm

  he paused and red crow puzzled and
impatient stared at him angrily

  the rabbit continued

  they say ta-vi is waiting until the un-
compahgre utes lose their strongest medi-
cine then he will do as he did before
ta-wats beat him they say he will come
too near and burn then keep so far away
that all the mountains will be ice when
the cheyennes lost their medicine-arrows
to the pawnees they were whipped in battle
they were glad to buy the arrows back with
many ponies

  he ceased speaking and to the surprize
of all sat down

  amazement at the seemingly purposeless
speech was quickly replaced by an uneasy

suspicion there was none in the red audi-
ence who did not sense the warning and
threat thus obliquely expressed after
thirty seconds of silence red crow stood up

and harshly demanded

  what kind of talk is this for men to
hear has the walking dead man forgot-
ten there is a white man in this camp who
will soon be a ghost ta-vi keeps in his
trail the utes have lost no medicine

  the last two sentences evidenced how
thoroughly the chief had comprehended
the hunters veiled warning the latter
now stood up beside his robe and slowly
replied

  the hand of death is always on my
shoulder each sleep it presses harder if
your medicine-man digs medicine tobacco
ashes from a medicine-pipe and scatters it
on my toes he can not hurt me i have
walked close to the darkening land i am
almost in sight of the black houses there
is nothing left for me to fear

  i speak with a straight tongue they
say the uncompahgre utes have lost a very
strong medicine and will be glad to give
many ponies to get it back just as the
cheyennes would give many ponies to buy
back their medicine-arrows they say
the ute strong medicine is not in the medi-
cine-lodge

  startled glances were darted around the
circle anger began to show in each savage
countenance anger because the utes
feared the rabbit spoke the truth for
several minutes none moved from his place
or spoke then red crow leaped to his
feet and walked slowly to the medicine-
lodge he walked slowly to conceal the
dread now choking his superstitious soul
none offered to accompany all studiously
avoided gazing after him he entered the
lodge and was out of sight for several
minutes wthen he emerged it was with
great abruptness as if some invisible force
had hurled him through the opening

  he ran at top speed and shouted
hoarsely as one who brings word of some
terrible disaster the circle became mo-
bile and was on its feet some running to
meet him others swaying back and forth
etiquette was forgotten all seemed to be
talking at once gesticulating and yelling
those who went to meet red crow now
turned back and ran behind and beside him

  on arriving at the council place the chief
flung both hands high above his head and
pards



struck a dramatic pose while waiting for
silence the confusion ended as abruptly
as life ends

  the stone-medicine is gone the stone-
medicine is gone red crow shouted sev-
eral times

  none of his men spoke he became si-
lent breathing deep and rapidly like an
exhausted runner the rabbit got on his
feet and asked

  has the red crow looked with sharp
eyes has he looked everywhere in the
lodge

  it is gone

  the rabbit folded his arms and swung
his quick glance around the circle and
loudly announced

  then the walking dead man has more
talk my medicine tells me your stone-
medicine is angry because you would kill
one of the white men give me the three
white men and do not get in front of us
when we leave this place and your medicine
will be returned

  terrible rage convulsed red crows
usually immobile features now he knew
there was nothing supernatural about the
disappearance of the stone idol

  the walking dead man knows where
the lost medicine is he denounced

  no he does not know but he knows
it will be returned when the white men are
set free

  by a mighty effort the chief smoothed his
countenance down to a mask-like stolidity
even if he could not master his fear and
anger he forced himself to meditate he
believed the presence of at least one of the
three prisoners had brought death to his
father little tree he knew the medicine-
ponies had been used as riding animals that
the medicine-lodge and sacred pipe had
been profaned but the loss of the medicine
was a tribal calamity all his ambitions
of succeeding ouray too friendly with
whites since his visit to washington were
ashes until the stone image was recovered
he seated himself on his robe and quietly
said

  the walking dead man has something
to trade

  he trades the lost medicine for the lives
of three white men

  how will he trade when he does not know
where the medicine is demanded the
chief

  he will know after the white men have

their guns and are put on horses and after
red crow and his men say they shall not
be hurt send six warriors with us to the
open place below this camp and my medicine
will then tell me to send back word where
the lost medicine is

  lomsom touched the gamblers elbow
and whispered

  you dont take that euclid away
hes nothing to me kill him if you
want to shortly replied goss but if
you buck against the rabbits medicine
youll quit being the white chief of the
utes the rabbit might even prove youre
to blame for the loss of the medicine and the
death of red crows father

  theres medicine and medicine un-
easily muttered lomsom but that chunk
of stone didnt walk off by itself some of
you stole it red crow aint a fool

  red crow whispered with some of the
older men for several minutes none of
the renegades followers were included in
the conference lomsom noticed this and
was afraid finally the chief stood behind
his robe and announced

  the uncompahgre men say it is good to
know how the medicine left the lodge
they say it is good to know this before a
trade is made with the walking dead
man

  the rabbit believed his own stone-
medicine for locating what is lost could
show the vay to the hidden image and he
murmured an appeal to unelanuhi to blind
the eyes of the brown rock until the white
men were safe then he asked-

  who knows how the medicine went
away and where it is

  the medicine-pipe knows how it went
away promptly answered the chief it
has been smoked by that white man and
he pointed a finger at ellis it can not be
passed around the circle to be smoked by
more white men it is very angry it can
give medicine to another pipe that will be
passed and smoked the man holding the
pipe when it goes out stole the stone-
medicine

the casting of lots by means of
a lighted pipe passing around a
circle to determine who should
undertake some unusually haz-
ardous service was common among several
tribes but this appeal to the pipe was
unexpected by the rabbit and his heart was


adventure

troubled he suspected that his offer to
trade was refused determined to know
the worst he insisted

  why smoke a pipe it will not bring
back the lost medicine

  what man knows what a medicine will
do countered red crow the medi-
cine-pipe is very angry four bad things
have come to the uncompahgre men since
three white men came to this camp there
are the medicine-ponies ridden by white
men a ute man can not ride nor strike
one there is the father of red crow dead
because a bad spirit came here with a white
man

  there is an angry medicine-pipe a white
man has smoked now the stone-medicine
is gone they say a white man stole it
after smoking the medicine-pipe if the
voices we hear are not lies then ta-vi will
give us some fire to burn the white man until
he tells where the stone-medicine is hidden
light the pipe and bring it to the head of
the circle

  the rabbit whispered first to elhs and
then to euclid xit looks bad a medi-
cine-man among them hopes to win great
honor by this test we must smoke

  an old man grotesquely painted and
shaking antelope hoofs for a rattle brought
a lighted pipe to the chief and indulged in
some mummery as he handed it over then
he held the rattle with two hands and took
his position in the circle this was the
ambitious medicine-man the rabbit had
suspected as being the instigator of the
novel test

  red crow puffed four times at the adul-
terated tobacco and filled his lungs with
smoke and exhaled it slowly from nose and
mouth after passing the pipe to the man on
his left in silence each ute in turn sucked
several times at the stem and permitted the
smoke to issue lazily from mouth and nose

  the pipe reached goss whose fastidious
nature rebelled he made a wry face but
took his four puffs before passing it to
lomsom the pipe traveled to ellis and
he was greatly relieved to observe the to-
bacco would last until beyond his two
friends the rabbit smoked leisurely and
euclid smoked impatiently and muttered
ive proven theres no such thing as
chance and i know theres nothing in
this silly idea of medicine

  smoke but keep still warned the rab-
bit under his breath

  the pipe was burning strongly when it
reached the end of the circle the man sitting
on red crows right the white men with
difficulty concealed their relief the pipe
had not gone out but the rabbit worried
them anew by informing-

  islow it comes back

  the prisoners had assumed the test was
ended once the circle was traversed by the
pipe nor did the last man to smoke pass
it to red crow to begin another round but
started it back from left to right each
warrior now puffed more strongly and the
concoction of willow bark and a meager
amount of tobacco was being rapidly con-
sumed with practised eye the rabbit
measured the contents of the bowl by the
warriors haste in expelling it the smoke
was almost white and very hot

  as the pipe neared euclid the smoking
was more furious and the stem was snatched
quickly with stony gaze the rabbit saw
the smoking bowl swiftly come along the
line euclid perhaps doubted his ex-
pressed disbelief in chance for his hand
trembled when he took the pipe and he
spilled some ashes a low hissing sound
ran around the circle and every copper face
was turned on the nervous smoker in fero-
cious expectation he puffed rapidly and
handed it to the rabbit the latter saw
the tobacco was all but consumed and began
inhaling slowly for now his medicine was
telling him how to baffle the utes the
pipe should go out in his hands he drew
in strongly to exhaust the fire elhs
thwarted his ingenious purpose by ex-
citedly snatching the pipe the rabbit
suppressed a groan and muttered-hurry
hurry

  elhs inhaled a mouthful of smoke the
second time he inhaled there was no
smoke he held the pipe before him and
stared at it dully

  as one man the circle of utes shouted
red crow leaped to his feet and cried

  the medicine-pipe speaks through this
pipe the stolen stone-medicine sends its
voice to tell us the thief that white man
there stole the medicine walking dead
man our medicine is very strong open
your ears to hear what the uncompahgre
men will do if the white man holding the
dead-pipe will tell where the stone-medicine
is we will give you two white men to take
away that man and that man

  he pointed to the gambler and euclid
pards



  what happens to the man holding the
pipe asked the rabbit

  he dies two will go away with you
the rabbit jumped to his feet and cried
then you will never see the stone-medicine
again you can not burn the hiding place
out of him for he does not know the
walking dead man who never again will
see the summer grass grow tall tells you this
on pipes the walking dead man does
not know where the lost medicine is but his
brown rock medicine will find it

  his medicine will not talk until three
white men ride with him down to the valley
of the arkansas now go ahead and bum
a white man slowly and lose your stone-
medicine forever and have the arapahos
and the kiowas and the cheyennes come
and carry off your women and ponies and
leave these mountains filled with dead un-
compahgre warriors

chapter v

from bad to bad

red crow and his men weighed the
rabbits warning in silence lomsoms
wild young braves felt the tug of ancient
superstitions and were entirely under the
influence of the chief the medicine pipe
had spoken the circle remained motion-
less eyes staring at the ground waiting for
the chief to order the white man to the fire

  the rabbits dark face was expression-
less although he knew the singing man was
sentenced to be tortured not until the utes
had pegged ellis out in spread-eagle fashion
and had lighted small fires on his chest and
stomach would they be convinced the stone
image could not be recovered by any knowl-
edge possessed by the thief

  goss stepped to the rabbits side and
whispered-

  something must be done to help the
pilgrim

  the rabbit frowned for him to be silent
and cast a glance at the heavens red
crow brought his men to their feet each
filled with enthusiasm by ordering-

  drive four lodge poles deep in the
ground and bring rawhide

  euclid hoarsely whispered to lomsom
  save him or youll never get a smell of

gold save him - you at least you

were born white

  theyd peg me out and burn me in a

second if they thought i knew anything
about that- medicine growled lom-
som i cant do anything hell have to

roast

  whooping and yelling the utes ran for
lodge poles the rabbit darted a glance at
the western sky red crow also discovered
it was growing dark he too swung his
gaze to the west enormous masses of
black clouds were crowding over the moun-
tain wall bringing an icy breeze from the
top of the continent

  light the fire near the poles work
fast he commanded

  two indians filled an empty kettle with
coals from a cooking fire brought it forward
and dumped it on the ground and threw on
fresh fuel of dead pine branches a rain
drop fell in the fire with a faint hiss

  faster ordered red crow

  two men seized ellis and began fastening
rawhide thongs to his wrists and ankles a
heavy drop of rain splashed on the chiefs
painted nose goss who now realized the
situation shivered slightly and gritted-

  - what a race

  a loud hissing like a nest of serpents
aroused to anger rose from the fire the
utes piled on more inflammable fuel but the
tongues of flame were drowned out as fast
as they appeared

  red crow much cast down and greatly
worried that the sky god in the west
should blow up a storm and for the time
render null the medicine of the pipe once
more consulted the heavens

  the dull hoarse rumble of thunder was
shaking through the dark heavens cracks
of white shattered the mighty onrushing
wall as the thunder god resumed the an-
cient and endless strife with the water and
earth gods a sheet of rain blurred the
western ridge from view and fell on red and
white men thinly at first came the drops
then thickly in a tremendous downpour
just as ellis was thrown on his back and the
gambler was reaching for his hidden gun and
was edging to seize the chief as a hostage

  the ambitious medicine-man who had
urged the test of the pipe spoke to red
crow the chief gathered his blanket
about his naked shoulders and loudly
shouted

  the medicine-pipe says to put the white
men in a lodge and watch them till morning
then we will burn a man till his tongue talks
straight the pipe says the man may tell
adventure

where the lost medicine is without being
burned

  a rush of wind swayed the lodges beating
them far over it was accompanied by a
terrific fall of rain a dozen warriors sur-
rounded the prisoners and hustled them to
the camp and with menacing gestures
thrust them into a dark lodge the rab-
bit free to come and go as he would joined
them lomsom who supposed he enjoyed
a similar privilege attempted to enter the
lodge and was stopped by two of the
guards

  the white chief of the utes walks where
he will he angrily shouted

  he glanced about with blurred eyes to
locate some of his men but if any of
these were within hearing they were under
the spell of the pipe and held back

  red crow says three white men stay
in here replied a guard

  the white chief is an uncompahgre
man all paths are open for him if this
red man can enter the white chief can
enter he pointed to the rabbit

  three white men stay in this lodge no
red men a dead man walking goes where
he will you have named a ghost an-
swered the guard still blocking the opening
against the renegade

  lomsom turned and ran to shelter

  inside the lodge the rabbit was squatting
on a robe and staring at the scarcely dis-
cernible faces of the prisoners the hoarse
voice of the storm and the increasing dark-
ness was making the work of the guards
outside very dismal euclid inconse-
quently remarked-

  i would have expected snow more than i
would thunder and lightning

  goss was the second to break the silence
he demanded

  what next rabbit will they carry
out the sentence in the morning

  they will try the singing man with fire
it is very bad they may try to get the
truth from you other white men

  ive got six shots first bullet is for
red crow theyll never burn me alive
declared the gambler

  death is easier that way than by fire
moodily agreed the rabbit but i have
promised to be home on a day named if i
am killed in this place my people will never
know i must keep my promise or shame
my people

  we talk in circles exclaimed the gam-

bler at least try to get us some more guns
so we all can go down shooting

  the voice of the thunder god became
staccato as he descended from the moun-
tains to hurl his fiery lances into the floor of
the park the darkness increased the
rabbit glided to the flap of the lodge and
peered out three figures were crouching
across the entrance with heavy robes drawn
over their heads to his companions he
announced

  the storm is very strong i believe
that kanati and his boys and asgaya
gigageif have come to help us you shall
try to run away

  now you talk sense heartily cried the
gambler all we ask is a start from this
cursed place

  three men are at the front of the lodge
said the rabbit

  he stepped to the opposite side and
passed his hand on the wall and located the
backs of two men pressing against the skins
he made a circuit of the place and then
announced

  we are surrounded the utes are
afraid of the storm but the medicine in the
pipe keeps them here he lifted his head
and began invoking o lucky hunter-
kanati-who with your two thunder sons
live in the west listen put down a smooth
path for my friends red man listen
send them help

  and he continued calling even on the in-
ferior thunder people who live in cliffs and
mountains and especially did he pray to
those thunder spirits living in the falls on
tallulah river back in the ancient home-
land of his people east of the mississippi
river

  a terrific crackling explosion accom-
panied by a flood of white light smothered
his prayer stunned by the shock the four
men remained silent the floor of the park
had seemed to shake

  - exclaimed the gambler

  for a few seconds the elements were silent
-long enough for the frightened guards to
raise a yell then the bombardment was
renewed and a violent wind tore the lodge
skins loose and swept them fluttering like
monster night-birds into the darkness the
guards were scrambling for shelter in the
interstices of the tempests clamor their
yelps of terror could be heard other wail-
ing cried also reached the prisoners

  the thunderers t the red man t lightning
pards



  the rabbit commanded

  come away kanati and the red man
have heard me the lightning hit the
medicine-lodge follow close

  he bounded away with the fierce wind at
his back and the white men followed they
ran with bowed heads the rabbit making
for the gulch below at last they entered
an area of comparative calm where the jut-
ting side of the gulch broke the force of the
wind the pony herd and the horses stolen
by lomsoms band already had taken shel-
ter there there were no signs of the
herders the rabbit shouted in triumph
and passed his hands over the animals and
rapidly selected the stolen stock

  he led a man to a horse until the three
were provided and gave thanks to the an-
cient gods on finding each of the stolen stock
still wore a horse-hair bridle selecting a
mount for himself he rode into the canon
where the effect of the storm was scarcely
felt

  the gambler exulted

  gamed them out of the pot thats
what i call playing a hand regular dead
mans hand never was beaten rabbit
you win

  the gods of my people won corrected
the hunter as he picked a path through the
scattered boulders what had been the dry
bed of a water course an hour before was
now alive with a foot of muddy water in
single file the four pushed their flight until
the rain ceased and a star rekindled its
light then the indian halted and an-
nounced

  the storm has blown out i must go
back they will start a search with the
first light

  dont go back pleaded ellis theyll

blame you and-

  no indian will hurt the walking dead
man reminded the hunter i will tell
them kanati and his boys and the red
man set you free then i will make a
trade goss where is the stone-medicine
at the foot of the tree nearest the spot
where i played solitaire

  i will trade the medicine for them to re-
main in camp two days they will be glad
to trade

they heard his horse stumble as he
headed him up the gulch the gambler said
he stands strong with his medicine
no amount of white education can wash it
out of his mind better dismount and lead

the horses i havent red eyes to pick a path
theres no hurry we have two days

the sun had several hours to
sleep when the fugitives entered
the small park where goss and
ellis had been captured they
halted and rested their mounts and their
own legs when they resumed their flight
they were galloping parallel to the flaring
skyline they entered the crack in the
northern wall and found the way dark

  when they emerged into lake creek
valley the sun was peering over the park
range and observing what new trick earths
insects were up to euclids usually placid
countenance was haggard and ellis could
barely keep on his horse for need of sleep
swearing softly he turned the animal loose
and limped to the lake and removed his
boots to bath his swollen feet in the icy water

  whatll we do now lamented euclid
as he dismounted that white scamp
lomsom will be after me to work his secret
diggings for him

   im going to take a sleep muttered the
gambler you might try your re cold
dry process in securing some grub

   ellis slipped to the ground and staggered
to a spot of warm sunlight he threw him-
self down and was almost instantly asleep
the sim was overhead when the gambler
shook him awake and informed him

  my feet are in bad shape may have
to stay here for another day youre nag
seems to be all right go down the valley
and make for denver ill meet you at the
broadwell house heres a hundred to
grub-stake you and he extended a roll of
money euclid can go along with you

   i have nearly a hundred and we cant
leave you alone to be caught cried ellis

  goss patted the gun under his arm and
smiled grimly then assured

  they wont come down this far the
rabbit will hold them two days after i
mend my feet ill start after you i can
knock over some game all i lack is a
good cigar take the money

   ill stay with you decided euclid
my horse isnt good for much

   well all stay said elhs

  youll go corrected the gambler
youre wanted no danger here for us
but youll be better off in denver

   i wasnt thinking of myself i dont
like leaving you two


adventure

  we can protect ourselves assured
goss with a whimsical smile and if
we get in a tight place euclid can use his
cold dry process quicker you start the
quicker youll find some grub get along
dont sing any good luck till we meet at
the broadwell house you ought to find
whip kang there

  loath to leave them yet believing he was
in danger until far from california gulch
ellis shook hands caught his horse and rode
for the arkansas by the time he was out
of sight of his friends he was planning to
avoid the risk of being identified

  a ride of a mile and a quarter brought him
to the mile and a half wide valley of the
arkansas with the river hugging the eastern
side keeping watch behind him to make
sure no party of miners from california
gulgh was at his heels he rode down the
valley for two miles and dismounted then
he led his horse off the road-the same
course taken by fremont in -and
climbed a rocky hillock

  from this elevation he discovered several
men riding from the north he led his
horse farther from the road to a spot hidden
from passers-by and nervously waited until
the men five in number had passed

  not daring to travel close behind them he
fastened his horse and threw himself on the
ground to sleep the sun was low when he
opened his eyes he knew he was within a
mile of where tabor discovered gold in
i when he came up the valley in the
spring a few miners were there striving to
overcome the black sand he decided it
was safer to pass this place in the even-
ing

  although he had taken a nap at the upper
lake and had slept again within gun-shot of
the road he found his eyes heavy as he sat
with his back to a boulder and waited for
the sun to cease balancing on the crest of the
sawatch range fighting against the per-
sistent desire to sleep he waited until after
sunset and then renewed his journey he
had not covered half a mile before he caught
himself dozing alarmed lest he fall off his
horse while asleep he welcomed a hut on the
right of the road

  at first sight he had taken it for a pile of
logs but a second inspection revealed it to
be a habitation he slipped from his horse
and approached the low entrance and called

out there was no response finding a
rope behind the shack he secured his horse
in a patch of thin grass and entered the hut
it was empty but a kettle of beans and
pork were on the coals of a rude fireplace
and blankets were spread on a pile of boughs
at once side the law of the road entitled
him to shelter and food and he ate greedily
from the kettie and reckless to the danger
of being recognized as the singing pilgrim
he threw himself on the low bed and almost
at once was asleep

  the sound of low voices greeted him when
he opened his eyes there was a light in
the low room through narrowed fids he
saw two men sitting at a box before the fire-
place they had been eating and were now
lighting their pipes the first speech his
ears managed to catch made him afraid for
one of the men was saying

  i tell you its one of the hosses that was
stole down the valley they blamed it
on to injuns

  but how did he come along here if he
took it persisted the second man whose
face was round and full like a moon

never mind how he come here he has
the hoss probably got turned around in
trying to get away from the valley road
queer he aint got a gun mused the
round-faced man

  queer he has nearly two hundred dollars
on him why should an honest man be
hungry if hes riding his own hoss and has
that much money

  i dunno i still hold injuns ran off the
hosses thats the word sent up the val-
ley that utes ran off the hosses in-
sisted the round-faced man

  and i believe hes one of the gang thats
been stealing hosses up and down the valley
for a year or more if hes honest he wont
be hurt you stick here to hold him if he
wakes up ill fetch some of the boys from
below

  the suspicious man rose to his feet his
cowhide boots making much noise he was
tall and gaunt and had to walk bowed over
to escape the low roof the second man
remained seated his fat face worried
after the man had disappeared into the
darkness the guard cocked his head for a
few moments then said in a low voice
better not hold your breath any longer
young feller youll bust

indian wives and white husbands

by josiah m ward

-he early american rocky moun-
tain trapper considered himself
fortunate if he possessed an in-
i-j dian wife more so if he pos-
sessed two it was not only the rough
frontiersmen who took unto themselves in-
dian helpmates men of distinguished
families married indian girls and raised
the children of the union to become useful
and honorable citizens but the men of
finer ancestry never had more than one
wife and rarely abandoned or repudiated
them when civilization came to the west

  col elbridge gerry grandson of the
signer took a cheyenne girl as a wife
long before he had viewed the coming of
white women as probable when the dis-
covery of gold transmuted a barren waste
into the lusty young city of denver he
moved his family one and all wife and
children to the place because it afforded
nearby facilities for education colonel
gerry was one of the finest gentlemen the
west-or the country so far as that goes-
ever produced he added luster to an hon-
orable name

  colonel william bent of bents fort
grandson of the bent who led the boston
tea party and son of missouris first
united states judge married a cheyenne
indian girl and by her had three children
she died and he married her sister by whom
he had two children the five were given
superior educations in st louis and four
of them justified the expense and care the
fifth charles bent was the worst sort of
renegade a leader of outlaw indians who
attacked farmers houses and wagon trains
burning pillaging and murdering

  these young indian women possessed a
charm and a comeliness that captivated
men of lonely lives such as trappers and
trading station men they were as cheerful
as a happy child with a happy childs win-
someness they were docile they were faith-
ful and they were the only wives available
in those early days except a few mexican
women who were willing to brave the wilds
with the men they loved

  their native dress was very attractive
the tunics being made of soft deer or ante-

lope skin with long fringes at all the seams
and trimmed with small polished antelope
hoofs with beads or bits of abalone shells
their moccasins were of deerskin and orna-
mented with colored beads or porcupine
quills their black hair was either braided
or confined by a fillet and their faces were
tinged with vermilion oftener than not
they were beautiful when they married
trappers these spendthrifts decked them in
the finest that could be bought vying with
each other in extravagant clothing the
indian girls however after the first flurry
in american fofarraws made them over
or ornamented them in the indian fashion
thus proving that taste in womans clothing
is a matter of geography

  an exceptional case was that of jim
beckwourth a french mulatto who fought
his way to the highest chieftainship of the
crow indians beckwourth made a col-
lection of crow maidens as wives his score
was thirteen or fourteen each lodged in an
individual teepee

  in contrast with gerry bent fontenella
culbertson and others of the high-class men
who married indian women was manuel
lisa whose father came to the united
states in the service of spain prior to the
louisiana purchase lisa was the first st
louis fur dealer to establish forts on the
upper missouri and yellowstone rivers and
to operate the business on a large scale
preceding chouteau and ashley he began
by trading with the osage indians in 
broadened his field accumulated a fortune
and died in  although he had a white
wife living in st louis he also married
mitain daughter of an osage chief and by
her had two children a boy and a girl
descendants of whom are still living in
western cities

  the first child the girl she surrendered
to lisa to be taken to st louis and edu-
cated his first white wife who was child-
less died in  and he next married a st
louis woman of high social position he
asked mitain to surrender her second child
the boy to him that he might have it edu-
cated mitain begged that she too be
taken to st louis where she could at least




adventure

see her children she promised that she
would not intrude upon the white wife nor
in any way create a scandal

  lisa sternly refused her plea he would
provide for her at the fort but the children
she must give up

  mitain gave way to all the fury of her
wild nature no longer was she the docile
wife she denounced him for his cruelty
and selfishness and endeavored to flee with
her boy but lisa took possession of the
child and hurriedly departed for st louis
she never again saw either child

  when maximilian prince of wied was
exploring and hunting in the rockies in
 he met a sad-faced indian woman and
heard the story about her her recreant
white husband and her lost children a story
with which every trapper was familiar the
woman was mitain

  as a rule the trapper with two indian
wives had a comprehensible system one
made his clothing including moccasins
kept the garments comparatively clean
repaired them lighted his lordships pipe
and added brightness and uplift to the
home the other took care of the horses
gathered wood and did the cooking usual-
ly the preparation of the pelts for the market
or the cache required the services of both

  la bonte one of the earliest trappers
was a stanch advocate of the two-wife sys-
tem and always clinched his argument with
this reminiscence

  at one time he had a ute wife whose
name in english was the reed that
bends a lady of the clinging vine type
and a shoshone wife whose name in english
meant she who runs with the stream
a sort of babbling brook or gossiper
during his absence on a three days hunt

his camp was raided by arapahoes his
spare horses and his accumulation of furs
seized his lodge burned and his wives
taken away as captives la bonte was a
philosopher he had lost all he had on
earth except the clothes he wore the horse
he rode the firearms he carried but he
calmly hobbled his horse made a fire of the
blackened ends of his lodge poles threw
a piece of buffalo meat on the coals
squatted down before the fire and lighted
his pipe

  what though he missed the delicate ma-
nipulations with which the brook was
wont to beat to tenderness the toughest
bull steak or the tender care of the reed
as she patched his torn clothing such was
life and after a solitary meal he drew his
blanket about him and fell into sound
slumber

  as he slept a figure emerged from the
gloom and drew near it approached the
fire and added a log to the pile it quietly
seated itself at the foot of the sleeper its
head bowed low and it remained silent and
motionless la bonte slept the night
through and at the first sign of day lazily
raised himself on his elbow

  wagh he exclaimed

  the figure remained motionless la
bonte leaning over turned up its face
it was the reed that bends and she was
awaiting his verdict she had escaped from
her captors and made her way back to her
white husband fasting and alone was she
to be cast off

  la bonte welcomed her to his arms

  thats the beauty of having two wives
he invariably added as the final clincher of
his argument if you lose one you have
the other left
author of the pool of executitn

 jiust a loose boulder on the side
of the dry watercourse an awk-
ward scrambling fall of not more
j than ten feet and old jim mc-
call knew that his number was up and his
chance of living a very slender one for
he had felt a sharp stab of pain in his right
ankle and had demonstrated with one hope-
less effort that the leg was no longer in
working order thereafter he had dragged
himself into the shade cast by a near-by
rock and had sat down to make a thorough
examination

  getting his boot off had been a labor of
infinite agony but once this was accom-
plished at least he knew the worst the
whole ankle was turning black and the
shape was wrong evidently a bone was
broken either in the ankle itself or just
above in the leg perhaps quite a small
bone but it meant everything

  wouldnt old japie laugh if he was
here mccall muttered looking searching-
ly at the bush and small trees all about him
for the first thing to do was to make some
sort of splint i wish he was here-even
if he did say i told you so 

  for japie du plessis held quite rightly
that it was the height of folly to venture far
into the nearly uninhabited waterless mazes
of the bush-veld north of the komati un-
less some one went with you two together
was all right or even one if he had a native

guide but the place was too big for a soli-
tary prospector so many little things may
happen to a man alone-little things that
would be insignificant but for the mere fact
that he is alone he may fall into an old
prospecting hole long forgotten masked by
the long rank grass of summer perhaps
it is only a dozen feet deep but if the sides
are sheer and he is by himself- he may
twist his ankle on a loose stone or cut him-
self badly he may have the ultimate mis-
fortune to break a bone mccall had quite
agreed with the sentiments of his old part-
ner and-had played traitor to his own
knowledge

  they were a queer paii  known in every
town from lydenburg to pietersburg mc-
call was fifty-eight thin and tough with
an instinctive as well as practical knowledge
of gold and most of the valuable secrets of
the earth du plessis was a few years
younger looked about a hundred with his
flowing gray beard and was very large and
likewise exceedingly tough his knowledge
of minerals was practically nil but he could
find his way anywhere in the out-districts of
south africa and was a wonderful shot with
a rifle

  so you have the members of a partner-
ship that had endured for nearly thirty
years and had penetrated with varying
success into most of the inaccessible corners
of africa du plessis filled the pot and at




adventure

times sold wonderful horns and skins mc-
call prospected for gold and had had his
successes

  but though they were the greatest of
friends they differed in one essential detail
mccall obstinately lived in the past and
du plessis-rather strangely for a man of
his race-had a wondering childish eager-
ness for modernity mccall habitually car-
ried an old  lee metford carbine princi-
pally because it had come into his possession
twenty-five years previously du plessis had
a wonderful rifle produced by the mann-
licher people that had cost him his entire
share of the proceeds of one of their trips
it was a perfect weapon and the fact that
it was most difficult to obtain suitable am-
munition did not trouble him at all mc-
call rather despised matches unless they
had sulfur tips and smelt abominably du
plesses had the very latest idea in automatic
flint-and-steels-which never worked-and
one of those electric torches that never
require a refill

  every time they got back to civilization
du plessis would hold back desperately from
the orgy in which mccall was wont to cele-
brate their return not that he had any
objection on principle but first he wanted
to ascertain whether there was any modern
gadget calling for the investment of his
scanty funds somewhere in the free state
lived his old mother and her unimposing
house was full of twenty years and more of
her sons offerings- many of the things
were broken and most of them meant abso-
lutely nothing to her but she was very
proud of them for many miles around
the house was regarded as a sort of museum
which is the real reason why mccall was
traveling alone

  they had dropped from nowhere into
blakfontein to buy a few odds and ends of
equipment ere setting out north and east
through the fever country to a spot near
the portuguese border an old native
had talked of gold-alluvial gold-in a dis-
trict which they both knew and alluvial
gold is the strongest lure of all they had
made their simple purchases and the store-
keeper had happened to mention casually
that he had written to johannesburg for
a steel-framed tennis racket with wire
strings blakfontein was a sporting little
dorp and the leading tennis player had a
fancy to try this new kind of racket

  that was enough for du plessis in his

youth he had been something of a player
himself and he felt that life would be a
blank until he had inspected this latest
marvel it might arrive at any time now
and there was no hurry about their trip

  man he had exclaimed the youthful
fire in his eyes contrasting strangely with
his patriarchal beard that is what i should
have had--an iron racket the other kind-
pouf-i always smashed them after a month
or so

  but mccall had chosen to be obstinate
he refused to admit that there was no occa-
sion for hurry as a matter of fact no one
else was in the least likely to have heard the
rumor and in any case as it was the height
of the fever season none but thoroughly
salted veterans like themselves was likely
to venture the trip but he would not admit
it they had come to blakfontein with the
intention of leaving again the next morning
and he was going to leave du plessis could
please himself

  du plessis had laughed his deep jolly
laugh and had pointed out that mccall
could never do a trip like that by himself
he would lose himself in the bush-veld and
with that funny old gun of his he could
never shoot enough food this assertion
had just sufficient foundation in fact to
make mccall more pig-headed than ever
he would not argue the matter at all he
would not even speak his mind was
made up

  as they had argued on every conceivable
subject for some thirty years and as mc-
call lost his temper every time and du
plessis was invariably calm and jocular the
latter took no particular notice of this pres-
ent difference he was going to stay and
see that wonderful racket that was cer-
tain mccall might pretend he was very
angry and start off by himself but he
would not go far ffve miles or so just to
get away from the dorp and then he would
halt it had happened so before

  but mccall did not halt the reflection
on his ability to find his way through the
country and live on it had hurt his pride
he would show du plessis just because
the big dutchman usually attended to the
pot he thought he was the only one in the
world who could shoot straight as for
making his way to any given point he
could do it with his eyes shut so he shoul-
dered his pack and pressed on he made
good time too and it was on the afternoon
the eleventh hour



of the fourth day that he thought he saw
a buck moving in some low bush and stood
on that treacherous rock to get a better
view

with his hunting knife he cut
two straight branches and
smoothed them down on the one
side with these he fashioned
some sort of support for the broken limb
and bandaged it tightly as well as he could
with strips torn from his shirt a make-
shift job at best yet productive of infinite
pain

  and it took time when he had finished
he saw that the sun would be sinking in half
an hour and it behoved him to gather a
supply of firewood for it was lion country
the big umbweni game reserve stretched
to within ten miles south of him and to
the east were the forests of portuguese terri-
tory in the morning he would think out
some plan of action but meantime he had
to live through the night-if he could

  luckily wood was plentiful near the dried
watercourse but it was a dreadful business
gathering it he managed to get a fair
amount to the open sandy patch where he
proposed to camp but he knew it was not
enough for safety mercifully it was sum-
mer and the night would not be so very
long

  he made some strong tea and finished
what was left of a guineafowl he had shot
and cooked the previous day it was an
effort to do this for the work of collecting
firewood had tried him to the utmost and
all he wished to do was to lie quite still and
try to forget the agony in his leg but he
knew it would be fatal to give in for that
way lay surrender-and death he would
fight hed show du plessis that even with
a broken leg he could make his way back
to some native kraal and live he knew of
a small one not much more than twenty
miles due west and he would set out at
daybreak

  but in the meantime there was the night
the sounds to which his years of roaming
had accustomed him took on a new signifi-
cance now that he was alone and crippled
no longer could he ignore the twin spots of
greenish light that shone ever and anon in
the blackness and told of some prowling
beast that watched him the coughing
roar of a hon seeming to come from all
points of the compass made him curse

softly and when this changed to the sinister
silence of the stalk he piled more of his
precious wood on the flames and reached

for his carbine

  it was a desperate vigil barely would
his wood last till dawn and yet it was out
of the question to seek a further supply
even had he been whole it would have been
madness to leave the protection of the fire

  two largo gleaming eyes were staring
at him from some bush away to the right
he raised his carbine and fired more to
hearten himself than with any idea of kill-
ing there was a frightful snarl and some-
thing went off at speed through the bush
he laughed at that-laughed almost hys-
terically-and heaid further hurried move-
ment at his back he swung round and
fired again

  he was convinced the wild knew he was
crippled and therefore doomed never be-
fore had he known animals so persistently
to hang round a camp especially after a gun
had been fired constantly he saw eyes in
the darkness and heard stealthy sounds in
the long grass but good fortune came to
him in one way for the old tree trunk
against which he had made his fire was dried
out and rotten and at last it caught it
would bum for hours so long as he looked
after it carefully he raked together all
the small stuff that was left and held it for
emergency he even dozed a little so the
night passed

  at the first sign of daylight he got to
work he made a crutch by cutting a two-
foot stinkwood branch and fining down one
end in the fire till he could jam it in the
muzzle of his carbine the butt fitted com-
fortably under his arm and except for the
fact that the wood would not jam firmly for
any length of time the crutch answered well
enough then he made for a waterhole he
knew of not more than a mile away down
the old watercourse it occurred to him
then that the proximity of this hole ac-
counted for the number of eyes he had seen
round his camp it cheered him up to have
this natural explanation for it was appalling
to think that the wild knew he was doomed
and was merely waiting

  it was a tedious business getting to the
waterhole and took him out of his way but
it had to be done the next water he knew
of was ten miles back and he was not all
sure he could make ten miles that day
even in the cool of early mom progress was


adventure

very difficult the leg did not hurt so much
now but it seemed to weigh intolerably
every little obstruction that yesterday
would have passed unnoticed now had to
be negotiated with much thought and care
a donga that he could have stepped over
became an abyss once when the branch
came out of his improvised crutch he came
down on the broken leg with his full weight

  it took him an hour to reach the water-
hole and he was pretty well exhausted
but the pool was there all right and he
soaked his bandaged leg in it and drank his
fill then he rested for a while till the heat
of the rocks warned him that the sun was
mounting and time was slipping past

  first he went through the small pack he
had been carrying usually the partners
traveled with a couple of donkeys but he
had meant to make good time on this trip
and had elected to bear his own load or
perhaps it had been merely a species of
spite bom of his somber rage against du
plessis he wanted to show what he
could do

  but the pack now was out of the ques-
tion regretfully he discarded his two old
busk blankets his small stock of flour his
spare pair of boots and the rest of his
meager kit all he kept was a little packet
of tea and a piece of fat bacon those for
provisions and then his water-bottle as
full as possible

  by the time he had finished his prepara-
tions it was perhaps eight oclock and the
sun shone down fiercely on a world rapidly
yielding up every trace of the mornings
sweetness with his old pipe clamped firmly
in his jaws mccall set out on what he had
a shrewd suspicion was to be his last trek
he knew well enough the penalty for dis-
ablement in the wild but he was going to
put up a big fight twenty miles-

   to the uninitiated the bush-
   kgsj veld looks flat or at most undulat-

         ing with here and there a kopje
iw to serve a most useful purpose as
a landmark the hunter knows that it is
rough and much cut up with dongas lit-
tered with loose stones here and there most
difficult for a man desiring to steer a straight
course mccall crippled as he was found
it a nightmare a long drawn out agony of
heartbreaking effort of racking pain be-
neath the pitiless glare of a tropic sun fre-
quently his improvised crutch gave way and

he would fall headlong constantly he had to
make wide detours to find a possible way
across a donga the strain of his unnatural
progress told heavily on even his tough
muscles and he was bathed in perspiration
but he pressed on

  he lost all count of time and was con-
scious only of the agony in his leg and the
blistering heat of the sun he had thought
no sun in africa could bother his accustomed
hide but this was outrageous-a sun such
as he had never experienced he had fre-
quent recourse to his water-bottle and be-
gan to mutter and talk to himself as he
crawled along he was surprized that it
was still daylight for he had been walking
so many hours and yet the sun was still
high and its heat unabated

  vaguely he became aware of movement
in the long grass to his left-movement of
which his trained instincts gave him warn-
ing though he was not aware of the reason
with a shock he came back to realities and
sitting down on a convenient rock hastily
strove to pull the stick out of his carbine
the movement in the grass had ceased but
the wood was jammed he dare not exert
any sidewise pressure for if the end broke
off he could never get it out curious how
it had slipped out so often as he walked and
now just at the wrong moment it jammed

  with an exclamation of impatience he
put down the carbine and picked up a frag-
ment of stone with a shout of startling
vigor he flung this as far as he could toward
the place where he had seen the movement
in the grass after all in the wild attack
was the surest means of defense and he had
to do something a large striped hyena
broke cover loping away unhurriedly look-
ing back over its shoulder with a sudden
wrench mccall got the stick out of the
barrel of his carbine slipped in a cartridge
and fired the beast broke into a clumsy
agitated gallop and soon vanished from
sight

  a hyena-and in broad daylight mc-
call muttered they must have me
marked down all right fair game just
because i go along like a crab the filthy
brute anything thats wounded and help-
less but i reckon ive still got a kick or
two left

  he broke off abruptly as a shadow swept
across the ground before him and looked
up much as a rabbit might look when the
sun sends warning of the approach of the
the eleventh hour



dreaded hawk a vulture was circling slow-
ly above him its wings outstretched motion-
less its ugly head stretched downward

  mccall shook his fist in a burst of
irrational anger for he was badly shaken

  come on then-flock around he yelled
you hunters of dead things ill show
you

  he fitted another cartridge into the car-
bine and fired at the bird above him but the
distance was deceptive and he missed alto-
gether startled the vulture sloped sharply
upward and planed away across the brazen
sky

  thatll teach em mccall muttered
and screwed the stick back into the muzzle
of his gun

  he was surprized to find how little water
he had left and shook his head dubiously
handicapped as he was he knew he could
never make those ten miles between his
present position and the next certainty of
water still he could try and perhaps there
might be a stream not entirely dried out on
the way with a groan of pain at the ne-
cessity for effor the stood up again slipped
his crutch into place and strove to press on

  his head was throbbing most strangely
and he found it curiously difficult to keep
his balance there was movement again
in the grass all round him beating against
the thin trunks of the camel-thorn trees if
he hadnt seen the hyena he would have
thought it was just the wind but now of
course he knew better hyenas-hundreds
of them-gathering round till he fell and
they could pluck up courage to make a
rush but he wasnt going to fall for a long
time he was feeling much better and he
didnt notice the pain of his leg any more
but he had to press on and he couldnt
afford the time to stop and shoot still
the human voice was quite enough for
beasts of that sort

  abruptly he began to sing in a loud
husky bass the parodied words of a song
that had been popular when first he came
to africa

comrades comrades every since we were kids
sharing each others tickies sharing each others
quids

  it was years since he had sung but now
he couldnt understand why the song
sounded fine it echoed in the wide spaces
and the sides of a near-by kopje threw it
back he imagined the hyenas sneaking

  

away one after another of course the
grass still moved but any one could see it

was merely the wind

comrades comrades ever since we were brats
sharing each others trousers sharing each others
hats

  they were jolly good words too-funny
words you didnt come across songs like
that nowadays it cheered a fellow up to
sing too if he had thought of it before he
would have come along much faster

  he paused at that half inclined to re-
trace his steps realization of what he was
doing came to him with a shock and he
resumed his pitiful progress fearfully he
knew well enough what it meant when a
man began to get those queer fancies but
very soon he was singing again mercifully
unconscious of his pain and of the insig-
nificant distance he was traveling yet
true to his instincts-the instincts of a man
trained to the wild-he did not go round in
circles but preserved a more or less con-
stant westerly direction despite his delirium

  it was perhaps three oclock when he
finally halted he had come to an ideal
spot here was a donga down which the
waters roared after every big storm and
some particularly heavy deluge in the past
had brought down a maze of uprooted trees
and bush to spew them on to a flat open
stretch of bordering grassland here was
firewood and to spare hed be safe enough
from the things that prowled by night so
long as he had a decent fire he wasnt
going through his experience of the previous
night again 

  heedless of the torrid heat he gathered
quantities of dried wood round two prone
trees that had been cast up by the flood
with astonishing strength he piled more and
more close by chuckling to himself at his
own forethought and cunning then he
carefully set a match to some small stuff
and laughed gleefully as it caught and the
bigger branches began to burst into flame
he drew back a little from the heat and
seated himself on the sandy earth his
water was finished but he did not notice it
here was such a fire as a man might dream
about and the night must be drawing on

  two native hunters from the border on
a visit to friends in a distant kraal drew
near at the unaccustomed sight of this big
fire in the glare of afternoon they stood
still on the far side of the donga but mccall


adventure

did not see them he was singing loudly
and beating time with his right hand

  truly he is very drunk one of the
natives remarked

  that is so the other agreed and
when the white men are drunk they hit us
without reason

  without more ado they turned on their
tracks and quickly disappeared

du plessis soon found out that
mccall had gone off in earnest
on the following morning when
he discovered that both the pack-
saddles were still at the little hotel and-
presumably-both of their pack donkeys
still grazing peacefully on the commonage
of the outspan he had chuckled it would
have been slimmer if mccall had taken one
of the donkeys just to make it look as if he
really was going so he settled himself
comfortably on the hotel stoop and awaited
patiently the arrival of the steel rackets

  but on the following afternoon a man
came in from an outlying farm and reported
that mccall had passed his place that
morning headed toward the northern le-
bombo mountains he was carrying a pack
and seemed in a bad temper but then old
mccall was always a bit of a character

  du plessis made up his mind deliberately
but with characteristic finality mccall
had gone without donkeys and had two days
start donkeys are utterly impossible when
it comes to quick traveling therefore it
behooved him to follow mccalls example
and carry his own pack that he could let
mccall go on alone never even occurred
to him

  when do you go back to your farm
he asked the man from outside who had
driven in behind a couple of mules im-
munized to the sickness so fatal to their
kind in the south african fever country

  first thing tomorrow ive got a few
things to fix up and we can make a night
of it hey

  of course but as soon as it is light
tomorrow we must set out it will save
time if you drive me to your house for i
want to catch up old mccall it-it was
not fair that i let him go off by himself

  so they had had their night of it and du
plessis who had an iron head had seen to
it that the unhappy farmer was on the road
by daybreak and when he had been driven
as far as the faxmer could take him he

  strapped his pack to his massive shoulders
and with a brief nod of thanks set off into
the wilds he slouched along and did not

seem in any hurry but the miles totaled up
amazingly behind him

  on the afternoon of the third day he came
to sibuyas kraal-the kraal which at that
moment mccall was striving desperately to
reach from the other side for mccall had
passed through the kraal and was beating
back to it from beyond most of the men
were away on a hunting expedition but the
few natives still there welcomed du plessis
hospitably yes rhinoceros-the native
and by no means flattering name for mc-
call-had passed through two days since
he had stayed for the night in the guest hut
and had left early the following day he
talked very little

  du plessis stayed long enough to smoke
a pipe in comfort and drink a huge bowl
of native beer then he shouldered his pack
again and set out heading due east for the
mountains

  toward sundown he saw the smoke of a
fire and walking to it found sibuyas
hunting party in camp sibuya was a trucu-
lent old chief with matabele blood in his
veins an avowed despot with benign views
a staunch friend and an enthusiastic enemy
he had made a little history in his time but
in his later years had been unswervingly
loyal they had had good hunting and
du plessis was received with acclamation

  but when he made known that he wanted
to catch up with mccall two strange na-
tives who had but just and by chance
joined the camp for the night asked quick
questions and then one of them laughed

  this man you seek he said we saw
but three hours since he had made a big
fire so that we wondered if the veld was
alight this not being the season but when
we drew near we saw he was seated there
singing very loudly and waving his arms
about truly he was very drunk

  there came a sudden silence at that for
the men of sibuyas kraal knew well enough
that such action was utterly out of keeping
with the character of the man they knew as
the rhinoceros and du plessis knew be-
yond any shadow of doubt that it meant
tragedy when any man by himself in the
wilds begins to behave strangely whatever
the cause the end is not far off and in the
case of mccall a hardened campaigner it
meant that the end was near indeed
the eleventh hour



  he was not drunk du plessis remarked
with ominous quietness it is in my mind
that i go now to seek the rhinoceros for
he needs help-as any but a mud-eating
native from the forests could have seen
you who have seen him must guide
me

  that is not so one of the natives
objected we have traveled far today and
are weary moreover already it grows
dark and there are many lions to travel
at night means death

  du plessis held himself in with an effort
and turned to sibuya there is a certain
etiquette on such occasions

  what do you say sibuya he de-
manded it is my old friend who needs
help

  these two sibuya replied judicially
indicating the two natives from the forests
are my guests tonight and consequently
i can not say to them go as i would
surely say to my own young men it is a
great pity for i like you and the rhinoceros
is also a man but you also are my guest
so how can i say anything if you beat
these two mud-eaters

  he shook his head solemnly and took
snuff from a small gourd elaborately deco-
rated with beads du plessis strode across
to the squatting boys and kicked them
savagely to their feet then he gripped
them grimly purposefully and they yelled
afresh as his huge hands sank into their
flesh

  it is in my mind that you will come
dogs he said truly the lions are bad
but you may escape them if you do not go
most surely you will not escape me so
can you feel the bone crack a little
more and- ah we go together it is
well

  we also come sibuya said shortly
old i am and useless but by no means a
mud-eater also when i was a young man
we did not squat down in the grass at the
mention of a lion of course it is under-
stood that many things have changed but
even now my young men can throw a spear
and know how to use the broad-bladed
assegai what say you my children

  his followers gave a shout of agreement
and reached for their spears sibuya old
aira wrinkled but still full of fire drew him-
self up proudly

  so you see he said softly to du plessis
these also are no mud-eaters we start

  now look to it some of you that those
two who are my guests do not-lose them-
selves for truly the night is dark

  there was a howl of appreciation at this
and the unwilling guides were strongly
guarded not that they wished to escape
now for safety from the beasts of the night
lay with sibuyas followers and they knew
it so they set out the natives shouting
and singing as is their custom when traveling
at night but making good progress none the
less

  still it was a weary and trying business
for night had fallen and there was no moon
the natives picked their way unerringly
across the broken country but it was a full
three hours before they sighted the dull red
glow that told of a dying fire

  du plessis made his way to the front then
hurried forward the natives pressing after
him clear against that glow he could make
out a black shadow that moved a little the
natives saw it too and shouted afresh but
the crouching shadow moved no more and
they all heard the snarl that came from yet
another spot away to the right

  du plessis called out a swift order and the
shouting ceased quite unshaken he raised
his rifle-his expensive and high-powered
rifle-and waited just a breath till two
points of green flickered in the darkness
then came the sharp report followed by an
ear-splitting roar and in the next moment
he had fired at the clear mark of the beast
silhouetted against the glow of the embers
something dragged itself into the long grass
and lay there threshing about snarling
horribly

  the natives drew together at that and
hung back for no man could hope to face
a wounded lion at night and live but du
plessis went straight on and at his elbow
was old sibuya for very shame they
followed

  in the bush to their right there was a
crackling of broken branches and du
plessis fired quickly three times and did
not know nor care whether he had hit
he was more careful with the animal thresh-
ing about in the grass for it was obviously
too badly hit to get away and therein lay
its menace he fired once-twice-at the
sounds and the snarling ceased abruptly
from some little distance came the horrible
laughing shriek of a hyena

  mccall was sitting up the delirium of
fever driven out by his long sleep and the


adventure

coolness of the night he had wakened at
the sound of the shooting

  ive busted my leg he announced bit-
terly as du plessis knelt beside him holding
a tin of water to his parched lips then
when his thirst was quenched i bet id
have made sibuyas kraal tomorrow if you
hadnt butted in

  du plessis said nothing but beat a stick
into flame and made a brief examination
the ankle was swollen and discolored but
it was not the discoloration of mortification

  man he said with a vast sigh of relief
youll soon be all right well fix up to
carry you to blakfontein dr pertings is
a very good man when hes not drunk and
i promise he wont be drunk when he sees
to you

  mccall swallowed once or twice for his

nerves were all jangled he had heard the
roaring of the wounded lion and knew just
what it meant du plessis had been per-
fectly right and he had been a fool to travel
alone also he had failed

  old pardner he said almost pleadingly
i may be this and i may be that but at
least im tough aint i

  they shook hands solemnly under si-
buyas direction the natives were already
constructing a rough litter of branches for
time was precious if the leg was to be saved
at the first streak of dawn they must be
away

  tough like them iron rackets you was
so keen about mccall went on after an
interval first thing when we get back
im going to buy one of them for you old
man

the best shots

by raymond s spears

f all rough-and-ready marks-
men i suggest that the mis-
souri ozark mountaineers were
the best in the united states
i speak especially of those in taney chris-
tian and adjacent counties down to with-
in twenty years and probably to this
day the shooters there handled their re-
volvers better than any other districts
gunmen that i ever heard of individually
and collectively

  from missouri probably came the best
marksmen of the west from kit carsons
boyhood onward kentuckians salted the
missouri wilderness with their own skill

  in that particular district the one cov-
ered by the bald knobber clan the shooting
was with meticulous accuracy two men
fought one put his bullet through the
others head and followed that bullet with
two others so close together that a dollar cov-
ered them this while the victim was falling

  courage was at the base of the accuracy
they never shot from ambush no bush-
whacker acting the coward could shoot as

well as the brave man who faced his enemy
in the open when at a church one night
two enemies met one who had the ad-
vantage of being in the shadow cast by the
moon sprang forth into the bright light be-
fore he drew his gun and thus all fair and
square and in the open the two fought-
and the man who would not shoot even
from a shadow was killed

  the practise in that land was to ride
past trees at top speed and then shoot the
trifling marks on the bark quantrills
riders and the upshoot bands of james
younger and cook-general terms covering
most indian territory desperadoes-and
other badmen had shooting characteristics
of the ozarks

  sporadic marksmanship appeared else-
where a few good men gave a whole lot of
mediocre shooters fame occasional good
or lucky shots made the reputation of
second-rate marksmen but as a region
with revolvers and derringers the ozarks
were as great as kentucky riflemen at
their best

o
  nlay effendi i am a poor man and
  thine offer is generous but i can
  not sell thee this dagger i pray

--j thee do not tempt me with these

gold coins of thy country for which i would
sell thee many things in my humble store
but not this dagger

  i know that there is nothing but the ex-
quisite etching of the blade and the carved
handle to speak for it and that these merits
have caught thy fancy the price thou
hast set for it would more than cover its
value yet i can not sell it to thee effendi
nor to any other man there are many
other things among my wares worthy of
thine ownership

  alas there is a tale effendi which i shall
tell thee and then thou wilt understand
why i can not part with this trifling thing
trifling in thine eyes whom allah has
blessed with worldly goods but priceless to
me mehemed ah who owns but this insig-
nificant stall in the bazaar of bosna seray

  there is kuskus for thee effendi and this
tchibouk rest thy back against these
cushions and listen to me it is not often
that i repeat this tale to strangers but thou
hast been kind to me and many things hast
thou bought to take back to the land of thy
fathers may allah bless thee with long
life and may thine offspring increase hke
the goats on the mountains of hercegovina

  it is now many years since the austrians
came to bosnia when bosna seray was but

a sipall town and not the capital and not
so many since they have left it again
there was war on both occasions but i had
no part in it the first time i was too
young and the second time i was too old
besides effendi i am a peaceful man

  after the austrians had come the first
time and had quelled the uprising with
many soldiers and put garrisons in all the
larger towns they forthwith began to build
roads and schools but they did not pene-
trate into the mountains not in the times
of which i speak and the town of banya-
luka was in the heart of a mountain dis-
trict where they had but a small number of
soldiers

  word had come to the general who com-
manded at bosna seray that a daring ban-
dit was active in the mountain fastness
around banyaluka the bazaar was full
of tales tales of cunning and dark deeds
the people were afraid of the bandit but it
was said that he did not harm the poor but
took his booty from the wagon trains of the
austrians which were sent to supply the
garrison of banyaluka

  it was also said that many a loaf of
svaba bread was eaten in the hans of the
poor people in the mountains and that they
also found flour and rice on their doorsteps
in the mornings all these were gifts of the
bandit thus were the tales of the bazaar

  i was but a youth in those days and my
face was still beardless but i was strong




adventure

and made a living as hamal which is a car-
rier of loads in the employ of the austrians
who were then building bridges across the
milyaka river the engineer who built
these bridges was a captain in the austrian
army named hessler bey i knew him
well his assistant was a lieutenant whose
name was kohlman strong was this
man and tall taller than any of the aus-
trians who were part of the garrison of
sarajevo as they called bosna seray

  one day when i was resting at noon time
in the shade of an olive tree kohlman
effendi approached me and began to ask
me questions did i know the country
west of sarajevo had i ever traveled
as far as banyaluka and did i know the
mountain trails

  my fathers han stood on the ponir pla-
teau overlooking banyaluka and well did
kohlman know what my answers would
be

  to make a long tale short effendi he
engaged me as guide and promised to pay
me well we were to start afoot during
the next morning i was to meet him on
the banyaluka road which leads out of
bosna seray from the western gate

  the sun had just come over the borya
planina when i passed through the gate
but there was no austrian in sight but a
bearded moslem a hadshi for he wore the
green turban of the prophet

  great was my surprize effendi when he
made himself known to me it was kohl-
man

  as we walked the many weary miles he
told me that he was going to catch the ban-
dit of banyaluka this also surprized me
for the austrians were never prone to tell
their plans to the people of bosnia for
there was little love for them in the hearts
of the people he gave me money with
the promise of a rich reward if i did his
bidding

  i was poor then effendi poorer than i
am now for i have never amassed riches
and i accepted his offer and promised to
guide him faithfully if he did not insist
that i should raise my hand against my own
people	t

  at this he laughed he would take care
of the bandit himself i was to be his
guide naught else

  when we arrived at banyaluka he did
not go to the commander of the garrison
we lived at the han of yussuf ibrahim who

felt honored to give shelter to a hadshi and
his follower

  well did kohlman speak the languages
of the land he knew both turkish and
servian and so he was able to question
the people about the bandit the people
answered him gladly for they thought him
to be a holy man who went into the moun-
tains with his follower to meditate and to
pray it often aroused my anger to see

this infidel spread his prayer rug and turned
his face toward mekka he did not pray
he merely went through the motions in
order to deceive the people but he paid
me well and i was a poor man i held my
tongue and bided my time

then came days when i could
show him no more he knew
the country as well as i did and
he went out alone i would
spend my days in the coffee houses and in
certain other places even in those days
many troupes of arabian performers came
as far north as banyaluka and they carried
with them a number of dancers which were
known as ouled nayls those i loved to
see for i was young then effendi

  one day kohlman returned after an
absence of three days the deeds of the
bandit were now a byword of the people and
with the exception of the austrians no one
paid much attention to his exploits for he
never harmed the people as i have told
thee effendi he only robbed the military
trains of the austrians

  they had increased the guards for these
trains and many soldiers walked alongside
of the wagons and horses in the begin-
ning the bandit had boldly robbed during
the bandit of banyaluka

ii

the day but now it seemed he came at
night and evading the sentries took what
he pleased but he had never slain a man
which was good for had he done that the
austrians would have sent many soldiers
to catch him what he did and what he
stole merely annoyed them and they did
not think it worth while to concentrate
many men in one place they did not have
so many soldiers and then there was still
unrest in the south

  this night kohlman took me with him
we went into the hills south of banyaluka
and waited behind the large boulders
alongside of the road over which the aus-
trian trains were traveling

  it was a dark night and great clouds
sailed before the wind over the mountains
midnight came and then we heard the
creaking of wagon wheels and the breath
of laboring horses for it was a steep path
then the column came in sight ten
wagons there were but no soldiers came
with them except those who sat on the
wagons three men to each as they ap-
proached us kohlman halted them he
spoke to the sergeant who was with the
first wagon and this man shouted a com-
mand the wagons were drawn up along
the roadside and the horses were unspanned
and driven a little ways off then the
soldiers made fires and set up little tents
they placed no guards

  then kohlman returned to our hiding
place we could see the entire length of
the wagon train for the fires gave enough
light except for the last two wagons
which loomed as black bulks in the shadows
of the mountain each of the remaining
eight could be plainly seen our hiding
place was directly above the ninth
wagon

  suddenly a few small stones came down
the mountain kohlman gripped my arm
as i started to rise strong was his grip
effendi and he pulled me down i listened
i could hear a faint sound as if cautious
feet were moving over the rocky ground
and then i saw

  a shadow passed across the road to the
last wagon a sound ever so light as if a
knife were passed through the canvas cover-
ing the loads after a few minutes the
shadow reappeared and it seemed that the
figure carried something on its back
noiselessly it disappeared up the mountain

  after a while kohlman followed and i

trailed after him just then the clouds
lifted and we could see the figure ahead of
us in the moonlight it was but a quarter-
moon yet enough to disclose the lone man
who carried a sack on his back up into the
mountains of banyaluka a small man he
was and not strong for he was going slowly
bent under the heavy load

  we gained rapidly and then he heard us
he turned around and saw two men fol-
lowing one kohlman being of enormous
size the bandit dropped the sack as
kohlman started forward on the run and
turning fled up the mountain

  but kohlman was quicker he followed
in mighty leaps and when i came up to them
he had seized the bandit a dagger
gleamed in his hand but kohlman seized
his wrist and the dagger fell out of the
bandits hand i picked it up

  just then kohlman laughed it was an
ugly laugh effendi it conveyed to me
something i did not at the moment under-
stand but came to me when i heard him
say-

  a girl a young girl at that

  and then i saw it was a girl dressed
as a man but the tussle had loosened the
turban she had worn and her black hair
long hair reaching below her waist was
streaming forth

  she struggled to gain her freedom but
she was helpless in kohlmans arms and
then i realized what his ugly laugh had
meant i had heard of him in bosna seray
-of broken lattice windows in the seraglio
of many citizens-but it was bazaar talk to
me then and many things are told which
have no more merit than a tale but i
saw and i did not move i stared-i was
young then effendi

  but the girl cried out

  if thou are a moslem a bosnian help
me wouldst thou let this infidel despoil
a maiden of thy people

  her cry of despair awakened me the
dagger she had dropped lay at my feet
i do not know how it happened effendi
but there was a red mist before my eyes
my right hand struck and struck again and
again the dagger plunged through bone
and flesh into kohlmans back as he still
held the girl against him i do not know
how often i struck i was blinded by rage
when i had calmed down there lay kohl-
man at my feet he did not move his
eyes were glassy and looked into the sky


adventure

i remember that i wiped the dagger on the
scarf around his waist before i realized that
i had killed a man

aagpwb the girl stood trembling lean-
ing against a rock i picked up
the sack she had dropped and it
sjr was heavy

  lead thou i said to her and i will
follow i shall carry this sack for thee and
then return to cast this carcass into the
gorges of the verbas river no one will
ever find it

  but the girl shook her head

  there are soldiers below and i heard him
talk to them before i stole up to the wagon
i did not know then that it was him but i
recognized the voice they will be looking
for him if he does not return within two
hours

this i considered and i sat down to find
a plan the girl sat beside me watching
the road below the soldiers could not be
seen but the glow of the fires was still high
finally i found a way out

  take this dagger i said to the girl
and cut my arm my right arm it
must appear that i have fought with the
bandit and that he did escape go back
to your han and take this dagger with thee
remember that it must be the last time
that thou hast taken food from the austrians
this dog has paid me well and given me
a paper to the general who sits at bosna
seray and a reward is coming to me it is
dark and i can not see thy face but come to
bosna seray where thou wilt find me at the
house of husref beg who is my uncle by
this dagger i shall know thee

  ere i could prevent her she had taken my
hand and lifted it to her forehead

  i too she said can not see thy face
but i will find thee o defender of the vir-
tuous i am not a thief i have but taken
what was taken from the han of my father
when the infidels came into this land
they burned the han after taking bread
and maize and left my people to starve i
have taken from them but bread and flour
and this sack contains no more than to even
the score i will take it to the mountains
and then i shall come to bosna seray i
shall serve thee o protector of the poor
then she picked up the sack forgetting
what i had asked her to do i called her
back repeating my request

  i can not hurt thee but i must do it to

save thee she said in a voice that trembled
with tears and then she took the dagger
out of my hand and drove it into my right
arm while i busied myself to stop the
flowing blood she had vanished

  i returned to the wagons and bade the
soldiers to get the body of kohlman they
did not believe my tale and turned me over
to the commander at banyaluka who sent
me under escort to bosna seray the gen-
eral heard my tale and when he saw my
arm he believed me and called a doctor
to dress my wound when the arm had
healed he gave me enough gold to buy this
stall in the bazaar which i stocked with the
kind of goods which thou seest now effendi
kohlman had written a paper stating that
i had served him faithfully and i felt no
desire to contradict him

  one day after i had finished the noon
meal i was sitting in the door of my stall
when a woman approached me she was
veiled and i could not see if she was young
or old for the garments the women of my
race were wearing at that time effendi did
not disclose a womans figure

  i thought that she would buy some of
these trinkets i had for sale and followed
her into the stall which was then just as
dark as it is now effendi it helps the
trade for one can not examine too closely
and it is only men of thy race or women
who insist upon light afraid that they might
be taken advantage of

  within the woman threw aside the folds
of her garments and i beheld even in the
dimness of my stall the slender form of a
girl which had been on my mind ever since
that night in the mountains of banyaluka
from her sash she drew a dagger and then
i was certain

   is that all of the tale

  not quite effendi but i do not believe
that thou wouldst like to hear the details
of the wedding which my uncle husref
beg arranged and of the change that has
befallen zorbeida my wife who was once
a bandit that is her voice now effendi
scolding the neighbors and it is not the
same music which gladdened my ears in the
mountains of banyaluka where kohlman
had been slain

  and is this the reason why i would not
sell thee this dagger

  nay effendi thou art wrong

  by keeping this dagger i am able to con-
vince zorbeida that i still love her for
the beachcomber



women are sentimental effendi and easily
offended i know-for there are arabian
dancers in the coffee house of ah ben
murzuk on the lower banks of the milyaka
river and effendi if thou wilt go with me

this evening i shall show thee one ouled
nayl who resembles zorbeida when she
was young

ayee but these women love gold-i have
told thee effendi that i am a poor man

       towns have not been good to me
       men have not been kind
       womenfolk that i have known

 well-were not refined

         so ive come to rest awhile
         on this fairy palm-fringed isle

        come to rest and dream and wait
        for my ship that men call fate

        for my ship my dancing ship
        with figurehead of gold

 silken sails to tease the gales

and rubies in her hold

 hes a faithless vagabond

        do  hear you say

        singing songs of samarkand
        maundring of cathay

        fate may seek this sorry scamp
        as a rusty ocean tramp

         ancient dingy fit to be
         lost in the sargasso sea

         not a fairy dancing ship
         with figurehead of gold
         silken sails to tease the gales
         and rubies in her hold

         keep your smug religious creed
         framed for proper folk

        damn me as a vagabond

         treat me as a joke

         let me only rest and wait
  for my ship that some call fate
 for my ship that means to me
 more than immortality 

         for my ship my dancing ship
 with figurehead of gold
 silken sails to tease the gales
 and rubies in her hold

for east is east and west is west

              and nevr the twain shall meet

he was all wrong that feller-all wrong
and ill tell you how i know he was wrong

  i aint no pessimist not by a danged
sight i aint if a little kid burns his fin-
gers on a red-hot stove and keeps away from
the fire from that time on you dont call
him a pessimist thats me-burnt to a
caution

  all the harper tribe as far back as i can
figure out was cautious we bred more
runners than we did fighters of course
there aint as many of us as there is smiths
smiths predominate as it were anyway
the smith tribe aint got nothin to do with
this

  i aint been in piperock for several weeks
me and dirty shirt jones has been pros-
pectin back in the whisperin creek hills
with our usual good luck-of gettin back
before all our food was gone and we finds
my pardner magpie simpkins settin
at the table in our shack wearin his sunday
clothes

  magpie is so danged tall that it takes him
all day to find out whether a certain pain is
indigestion or inflammation of the knee-
caps hes solemn magpie is and when
that elongated pious-faced cross between a



scientific lecture and a-fool statement

gets pouches under his eyes and droops his
eyelids like a blood-hound-caution cometh
to me

  magpie is writin hes got ink plumb
to his elbow and the floor is plumb littered
with paper does he welcome us effusively

like - he does he just looks at us

kinda reprovin-like as if we should a
knocked

  well you old cattywampus howdy
greets dirty shirt

  dirty has one eye that kinda oscillates
as it were not bein what an astronomer
would call a fixed orbit it does a lot of jig-
glin before it picks up what dirtys lookin
at

  but it dont noways affect dirtys aim
bein as he shoots with both eyes open and
most of the time with both legs workin
magpie looks him over solemnly and says-

  mr jones i give you good afternoon

  dirty spits in the general direction of the
stove

   ill take it says he

  mr harper says magpie dignified-
like

  i kicks the door shut slides my gun
around where i can get it real quick and
looks my old pardner over hes shaved
yeah you can always tell when magpie has
shaved because hes got so danged many
when east met west



wounds hes got on a celluloid collar-one
of them kind that it aint safe to smoke in
i can smell stove polish which magpie has
used on his boots

  take it all theway around magpie simp-
kins is a dude

  you aint got yore days mixed have
yuh i asked

  days mixed

  he speaks like an actor-kinda runnin
the scale in g flat as yuh might say

  this aint sunday says i

  i am well aware of it

  then whats the idea of dressin up
thisaway

  the idea hah he kinda swells up
with importance im the president

  i looks quick at dirty who is starin at
magpie with his mouth wide open then
he looks at me and shakes his head

  ike says he hoarse-like i knowed it

by- the human brain can jist stand so

much hes been feeblin up in the head for
a long time ive seen it cornin on by de-
grees and i aint a mite surprized there
aint nothin yuh can do except to hopple
em so they cant hurt nobody

  magpie looks at dirty kinda funny and
dirty edges toward the door

  better git a rope ike advises dirty
backin again the door them high-
minded first symptoms is apt to degenerate
into vilence and we dont want him to hurt
nobody

  set down you-fool says magpie

i aint crazy

  proves it on himself declares dirty
nervous-like they all swear they aint
look out for his first rush ike

  but i holds firm to me hes always been
crazy so i aint scared of an extra degree

  democrat or republican president i
asks we didnt git back in time for the
convention you remember

  dont try to be smart ike says he
i plumb forgot that you fellers has been
away since you was here piperock has
advanced by leaps and bounds right now
i am writin a biography of our fair city for
all to read and appreciate how we have ad-
vanced it is marvelous

  what is the biography asks dirty
no-our advancement gentlemen we
are on the threshold of a wonderful era for
piperock no more shall the rest of the
world point a finger of scorn at our com-
munity no more shall they say that pipe-

rock is uncivilized unbalanced from this
day henceforth we shall blossom like the
rose our ideals shall and will be realized
to the fullest extremity how is that ike
fits in with what weve just heard
says i

  and with the dawnin of a new day-
magpie squints at his paper-all these-
thats as far as ive got

  and thats a-of a long ways if you

ask me said dirty shirt solemn-like

  now about bein president says i
yuh hadnt ought to go that far mag-
pie

  hadnt i huh thats who i am ike
look upon me i am the first president of
the piperock chamber of commerce

  what the-kind of a thing is that

asked dirty

  chamber of commerce dirty shirt
im surprized at you it is an organiza-
tion

  its the same thing as the chamber of
horrors says i only they deals in com-
merce mostly this one will probly have
horrors as a side-line

  nothin of the kind ike protests mag-
pie piperock is past the age of swaddlin
clothes we has emerged into the sunlight
and it will be well for all other cities to look
to their laurels i wouldnt be surprized to
see piperock one of the big cities of the
world we have everythin to make it big
yeah weve got a lot of country ad-
mits dirty shirt me and ike came across
twenty miles of it today and there was more
beyond where we started from if you want
to go east west north or south from here
yuh can find a lot of open country weve
got room to build thats a cinch

  but what would bring anybody here
i asks folks wont even come from para-
dise except to a dance and then they come

to pick a fight we aint got a-of a lot

to offer-except to somebody that wants
trouble magpie

  we will have ike the idea was started
in paradise originally me and wick smith
was down there last week and we went to
see a tent show it wasnt much good and
it wasnt doin no business me and wick
got to talkin to the feller that owned the
show and he told us all about his hard luck

  he says that a circus is a drug on the
market now and that animiles aint worth
nothin except in a zoo he says that hes
really surprized that some of our towns


adventure

dont have no zoo he says theyre all put-
tin em in in the east and that no town
can ever be an attraction unless its got a
zoo

  well me and wick has a few drinks with
him and got to talkin it over with him he
says hes got the ingredients of a first-class
zoological menagerie and that hes got a
idea of puttin the proposition up to para-
dise hes got a elephant of course it aint
no first class elephant bein as its kinda
run down from travelin so much

  the camel is-well it aint noways in
full plumage but its a camel the tiger
seems to be as good as tigers go he says
hell take a thousand dollars for the whole
bunch course he tells us how much wed
have to pay if we bought them animiles at
retail price but he kinda lumps em to-
gether and gives iem to us at cost

  wick smith is public-spirited and after
i tells him what well do about organizin a
chamber of commerce he ups and buys
them animiles on the spot the feller
throws in the cage free gratis for nothin
so that saves us quite a lot i figures that
we can pick up a grizzly and a wolf and
mebbe a mountain hon to kinda add to our
zoo folks will come a long ways to look
at wild animiles ike-a long ways

  me and dirty looks at each other and
goes out to unpack while magpie goes
ahead on piperocks epitaph

its been quite a while since we
put our foot on the rail so we
hurries up to buck mastersons
saloon where we runs into wick
smith and mighty jones mighty and
dirty shirt aint no relation mighty is a
little jigger who thinks hes big enough to
hold his own thats one reason why
mighty is mostly always on crutches he
swears in a tenor voice and chaws his to-
bacco

  buck greets us gladly but wick dont
seem so happy

  you fellers been prospectin again
asks buck

  yeah and were goin agin says dirty
shirt this here town is gettin too danged
effete to suit me and ike

  well i aint been treated right says

lars for some jungle insects and im won-
derin jist how im goin to cash in on said
contraptions magpie simpkins got me
drunk and talked me into bein a public
benefactor dang his hide

zoological garden thats what he done

the slack

clared wick the feller i bought him
from said that gunga din was a rare species

dred and thirty-three douars and thirty-

ger cn go plumb to - meat costs

money

  we left hassayampa talkin to himself
and went back up town where we leans on
bucks bar

  we aint been there long when mike
pelly ricky henderson and old testa-

ment tilton rides in from paradise mike
is the saloon-keeper and ricky runs the
barber shop the third member of this here
trio represents the other element of para-
dise

  testament looks a heap like some old
buzzard that had been disappointed in love
he wears one of them beetle-backed coats
a pair of pants that sure follers the contour
of his skinny legs and a pair of boots that
sag a heap at the top and shows that testa-
ment dont noways pinch his feet

  mike parts his hair on one side shcks one
side down until she almost reaches the bridge
of his nose where it retreats some sudden-
like he smells a heap of heel-yuh-tripe
perfume

  ricky is a barber he looks smells and
acts like one when he gets excited he ap-
plauds like he was stroppin a razor testa-
ment used to think that he had snatched
ricky and mike from the burnin when
testament first comes to that country he
has an idea that there was a lot of brands to
snatch from the burnin but he got scorched
a few times and let things go as they lay

  them three angles up to the bar shakes
hands with us just like they cared to meet
us and asks us to drink testament has
his usual lemonade and a wink and then
we discusses conditions

  how is everythin in this village of
iniquity asks testament kinda off-
handed

  iniquity -- snorts buck there

aint no iniquity in piperock were clean-
minded and antiseptic of condition if
theres any infection in this city its brought
here from paradise by golly some day
youll be glad to be knowed as bein a suburb
of piperock city

  haw - haw - haw - haw says ricky
suburb of piperock paradise will be a
mee-trop-polis when piperock goes back to
the prairie-dogs

  its difference of opinion that makes horse
races wars and so many kinds of whisky-
all out of one barrel me and dirty shirt
are plumb full of civic pride and were
willin to fight for our fair city-if we had
one-but piperock and paradise aint worth
no supreme effort so we slides out kinda
graceful-like and pilgrims back to our shack

  magpie is just goin away carryin com-
plete dignity and a lot of stationery i tells
him about the three men from paradise

  the word has reached says magpie


adventure

swellin his chest we shall not hide our
light under a bushel

  then you better hide yore carcass be-
hind a wood-pile says dirty shirt them
three antagonizers didnt jist ride up here to
git a drink of liquor

  we are a peaceable aggregation says
magpie no more shall the war-cry
sever nor the runnin rivers be red we are
about to shed the things that have held us
back uncivilization must bow to the tread
of wisdom the wheel of progress is turn-
in and woe unto him who gits under the
tire the people of piperock have risen in
their might unleashed the bonds which have
held them in darkness and are cornin out
into the light of a new day

  and says dirty kinda awed-like if

that aint a-of a lot to say all in one

bunch ill eat the garment that made me
famous

  magpie snorts and pilgrims on up the
street in spite of the mighty proclama-
tion he emits to us i notices that hes got a
six-gun shoved into the waistband of his
pants me and dirty stretches out on the
two bunks and rolls up a little sleep

in the course of human events
some queer things happen and
the queerest thing i can think of
is the fact that jasmine green-
baum came to teach school at piperock
jasmine aint the kind youd imagine would
take a job like that

  shes plumb decorative if yuh know what
i mean i aint goin to describe her cause
i aint got words enough her eyes would
make a man lift his head when somebody
is shootin at him she lives with wick
smiths family while shes teachin the young
of piperock to not shoot at each other

  me and dirty runs into her that evenin
after weve been stationary at bucks bar
for an hour or more dirtys active eye jig-
gles convulsive-like for a while and he
seems to be wearin about six too many
hands

  im sure you remember me says she
smilin at us

  if i lives to be a million i wont for-
get pants dirty

  i am mister harper says i and the
harper fambly has the longest memories of
any fambly on earth

  outside of the joness says dirty
my old pa could remember before they

started puttin aces in the decks of cards
memories dont figure says i were
glad to meetcha miss grenbaum what

can i do for yuh maam

same here says dirty kinda elbowin

me aside

  i told them that you were always will-
ing to do anything for the public good
says she smilin sweet-like

  to whom did yoo tell this maam i
asks

  somehow i kinda gets a hunch that every-
thin aint just right

mr simpkins the president of the
chamber of commerce says she he

and mr smith seemed to think-

  since when did they start thinkin
asks dirty that shore is a novelty to
my ears maam

  mr simpkins is a very brilliant man
says she he has some wonderful ideas
with parts missin says i

  perhaps you do not appreciate what
he is doing for piperock mr harper says
she i have just come from a meeting of
the new chamber of commerce where mr
simpkins presided and read us some won-
derful plans for the betterment of this town

  as you know we already have the nu-
celus of a zoological garden mr smith
who is heart and soul in the advancement
of piperock purchased these three jungle
animals our meeting this afternoon was
to decide upon a plan to reimburse mr
smith and to acquire the animals for the
city

 next monday is labor day i have
been lead to understand that piperock has
never celebrated labor day

  theyve sure celebrated everythin else
says dirty shirt my -- maam dont
let em celebrate you dont know pipe-
rock

  it will be a harmless celebration i
spoke about having you two gentlemen as-
sist and mr simpkins and mr smith as-
sured me that neither of you had any civic
pride they said that both of you were un-
civilized unprogressive and not at all in ac-
cord with any movement that would curb
your savage tendencies im sure it is
prejudice on their part

 yore danged right says dirty
them pelicans sure did lie to you in fine
shape maam piperock dont mean a
whole lot to either one of us but im willin
to do anythin yuh say
when east met west



  im cautious as i said before this here
idea of havin a pretty school teacher come
to us and hoodie us into doin somethin that
our hearts tell us is dangerous dont set so
good ive heard this same kind of stuff
before and so has dirty but any old time
a pretty girl smiles at dirty its just another
old garden of eden and a lot of apples

  she dont tell us what were supposed to
do but she does ask us to promise to help
em out well what can yuh do in a case
like that me and dirty goes back to
bucks place where we massages our in-
sides with bucks best

 and lemme tell you somethin-bucks
liquor sure tempers the wind to the sheared
sheep ten years ago he bought a barrel of
it he sells on an average of two or three
gallons a day and that barrel is still over
half-full it has never weakened as far as
we can taste

  after while magpie and wick comes into

the place dignified my- they act

like a pair of royal flushes

  gree tins mr masterson says mag-
pie lofty-like how goes things this day
and date

  well all right says buck bein kinda
dazed how did the meetin go

  perfect says magpie the die is
cast the ladies auxiliary is in complete
accord with us and we all feel that it will be
a day to date time from piperock will
emerge from her shell and take her place
among the cities of the world

  the ladies what asks dirty

rock acquirin a chamber of commerce and
three jungle curiosities they dont sabe

io

adventure

  its for the glory of our fair city says
buck

  wick turns around and walks out hes
kinda all choked up but i know danged well
it aint emotion me and dirty feels that
the fair city of piperock aint so badly in
need of our assistance so we saddles up our
rollin stock and goes to paradise town

paradise runs a dead heat
with piperock as far as city is
concerned when p t barnum
said that a fool is born every min-
ute he might have added that they were all
pointed toward yellowrock county

  we finds several of the above in mike
pellys saloon and among them is chuck
warner muley bowles telescope tol-
liver and henry clay peck these four dis-
graces are from the cross j ranch but
claims paradise as their native haunt also
we finds liniment lucas and tomb-
stone todd and hard-pan hawkins

  tombstone is so tough that he can wear
tight boots on his bunions and hard-pan
hawkins keeps books on his crimes tomb-
stone draws me aside and gnaws on one end
of his mustache while he cuffs his sombrero
plentiful

  ike says he hoarse-like whats this
im hearin about the hamlet of piperock
somebody was a-tellin me that theyve
convened up there to respectablize the town
somewhat

  its kinda hard to per-fume the rose
says i

  tombstone gnaws a little more and fights
his hat

  yeah i spose thats right ike are
you and dirty shirt part and parcel of this
here movement

  not knowinly tombstone says i
you can speak to me with perfect confi-
dence and go away feelin that i wont exag-
gerate what youve told me

  there has been braggin goin on
stated tombstone if theres anythin
paradise hates its braggin piperock orates
that shes leapin ahead like a bee-stung
bear she aint ike it jist aint no ways
possible for her to leap thataway she aint
active like paradise were able to do
things

 whereabouts in - does piperock

compare with paradise i asks yuh to an-
swer honestly she dont weve got
spirit climate and brain power weve got

courageous men wimmin and children
why our offspring are equal to two grown
men of piperock weve got everythin
ike

  except a elephant a camel and a tiger
says i

  whats them amount to

 and a chamber of commerce tomb-
stone

  mm-m-m yeah well

  well - right back at yuh i never
started this argument

  it aint no argument ike he explains
paradise is the legitimate place for them
things we could do it up right

  tombstone invites me back to the bar
which i accepts dirty is arguin with the
cross j outfit and liniment lucas and
from dirtys talk id gather that hes body
and soul with piperock

  from this day henceforth piperock
shall rossom like a blose orates dirty
shirt the people of piperock have rosin
in their might and we are cornin out into
the dight of a lew day and if that aint a
-- of a lot to say at once ill eat the gar-
ment that made me what i am today
from that time on things get kinda hazy
mike pelly peddles a brand that would
make a cotton-tail rabbit grow fangs in his
mouth and rattles on his tail im led to
understand that paradise is jealous of pipe-
rock and that paradise hankers for them
three animals like a calf hankerin for its
ma

  me and dirty balances on the edge of the
sidewalk in front of mikes place and be-
gins to cheer for piperock when some care-
less son of a gun moved a heavy chair plumb
out of mikes doorway and it hits me and
dirty shirt at the same time

  and when we woke up we finds ourselves
in jail hank padden our estimable sheriff
tells us that were in jail for disturbin the
peace

  you be- wails dirty shirt para-
dise never had no peace to disturb i can
prove it to any judge jury or collection
of folks which has two ideas above a
monkey

  i done my duty says hank firm-like
i was hired for this kind of work youll
probly git six months apiece

  this was sure cheerin news the para-
dise jail dont feed none too good we had
a idea that piperock would arise in its
wrath and come down to drag us forth-but
when east met west



they didnt i sent word to magpie and he

 answered it

i sent him this word-

me and dirty shirt are in jail
for upholdin piperock

and this is what he sent to me-

good for you we appreciate
yore civic pride

he didnt sign his name but he didnt
need to i sabe that hombre like a book
dirty gets kinda gloomy over it all and
swears that hes all through with piperock
right there and then i adds my voice to his

if thats patriotism says dirty
gimme death our own town has turned us
down ike harper i didnt think theyd
do it and they wouldnt if they wasnt
gettin civilized

a little later on cometh chuck warner
liniment lucas and testament tilton

you can take the preacher back says
dirty we aint in for murder you know

im not in my clerical capacity says
testament be ye both of good cheer

-of a fine chance the way hank runs

 his place here snorts dirty

ive been up to piperock says chuck
wigglin his ears chucks got flexible ears
and he can wiggle em like a mule

and nobody shot yuh gasps dirty
my gosh theyre sure gittin forgivin
chuck

 they aint no friends to you two says
 chuck seriouslike theyre glad yore in
 jail down here

 chuck warner is the biggest liar west of
 the atlantic ocean-but this time i be-
 lieved him

magpie and wick smith hope yuh stay
in jail says he

it kinda looks like theyd git their
hopes dirty acts kinda mournful

 it kinda does agrees liniment

hes got one of them long wet-lookin
noses and sad eyes i reckon his folks in-
tended him to be a undertaker but old
lady fate had horse-thief marked after
his name in the big book

is this here a party of condolence or
did yuh come to gloat i asks i hate like

- to have folks lookin at me through

 the bars

 condolence and good cheer says testa-
 ment hitchin up his pants you might
 call it a parley i will go now as it would
 not be meet for me to be party to it not

 that i aint in accord with it entirely you
 understand

  it sure must be a tough proposition to
drive you away observed dirty

  old testament pulled out hank unlocks
the cell door and they all comes in

  and what follered kinda touched upon
my heart-strings it was chucks idea i
listened to chuck hank and liniment lu-
cas as they unfolds whats on their minds
it has been said that every man has his
price ours was one elephant one camel
and a tiger

  they wants us to steal them three ani-
mals for paradise all weve got to do is to
hand em over to paradise and all is for-
given but theyre square about it at that
they will pay wick smith what he paid for
em and give us a hundred apiece

  and piperock aint treated you two
square says chuck

  thassall right says i but yuh cant
get away with any thing like that chuck
it wouldnt be hard for piperock to prove
that they owned em cause theyre all
there is of the species in yaller rock
county

  weve fixed that all up says chuck
dontcha worry about that end of it you
fellers go back home feelin sore at paradise
and nobody will expect yuh to raid the zoo

sabe

we went home after swearin
to do our little best and we finds
magpie in the shack composin
some more stuff we dont say
nothin about his kind note to us and he
dont mention it to us

  still tryin to uplift piperock on paper
i asks

  combatin a evil influence ike we
are the pioneers-others foller some one
is tryin to steal our thunder

  you got plenty of it declares dirty
they could swipe a lot of it from you and
still leave enough for a dozen men

  sarcasm is the weapon of the ignorant
says magpie what heard ye in para-
dise

  nothin much

  no huh did yuh know that para-
dise is emulatin us-or is goin to

  all fools aint dead yet opines dirty
shirt

  theyve ordered a elephant camel and a
tiger says magpie theyre payin a big
adventure

price for em just to keep piperock from
leadin the procession telescope tolliver
and muley bowles told us about it today
telescope said he thought we ought to
know about it

  yeah we heard about it says dirty
shift kinda off-handed like it didnt
mean nothin to us

  well were holdin a indignation meetin
tomorrow night says magpie we aims
to protest openly against such practise it
aint ethical you and ike be there will
yuh up in the mint hall the ladies
auxiliary will be there et cettery we
dont wish for blood to be spilled its
agin our principles and regulations but
by grab theyll go too far pretty soon-and
have to get helped back

  the next day is kinda quiet in piperock
but when piperock is quiet shes dangerous
wick smith aint at the store and mrs
smith aint got much use for me and dirty
so we keep away after samplin some
wobble water we pilgrims down to the liv-
ery-stable to see how hassayampa is
cornin

  but we dont find hassayampa in charge
wick smith meets us at the door and he
looks as wise as a owl

  whatcha want he asks

  whatcha got asks dirty

  wick clears his throat kinda hoarse-like

  ive got civic pride by-

  youve showed it wick says i
uh-huh if i had more sense and less
pride id be better off hassayampa harris
hands me a bill for thirty-six dollars worth

of feed-and i got so-full of pride that

i kicked him out and took charge

  my - that elephant is jist like a

hay-baler yuh cant fill it up i tell yuh
and he was feedin cleo-patree meat can
yuh beat that cleo-patree is the tiger
that soa of a gun has cost me one hundred
dollars per stripe

  wick says i wouldst be rid of em
wick looks at me for quite a while spits
painful-like and nods slowly

  wouldst

  i can get yuh a thousand dollars for the
layout

  ike i hope yuh aint lyin to me

  c o d says i

  thats the joker says he kinda wailin
c o d eh how in-can yuh de-
liver a thing like these id ask you half
of piperock is guardin this here stable

over across the street is pete gonyer
farther down the street is mighty jones
and up the other way is olaf hansen
one of them three has his eye on this place
theyre watchin to see that paradise dont
come and take them things away

  and at night theyre guardin this place
with sawed-off shotguns they heard that
paradise was goin to take away the menag-
erie thats what they heard

  its kinda easy to see why paradise
wants to shift the job to me and dirty
shirt jones says i cant yuh do as yuh
want to with yore own animals

  i cant wails wick magpie got me
drunk judge steele wrote out a option-
and i signed it i cant sell until thirty
days after labor day by that time ill be
in the poor house

  what do these here animals look like
asks dirty

  wick leads up back in the stable and
makes us used to the dangdest lookin trio
of animals i ever seen cleopatra is in a
cage on wheels and if there ever was a
meaner-lookin tiger ive never seen it
shes jist skin and bones and a big mouth
full of teeth

  the camel opens his mouth and grins at
us kinda asthmatic-like his name is

sahara and he looke like - it is

wasnt for his humps hed look like a moth-
eaten burro

  heres the e pluribus peritonitis says
wick pointin at the next stall there
stands gunga din i tied the son of a gun
up a while ago

  we steps over and takes a close look its
kinda dark in that stall

  whapl

  somethin hit me in the face and i done a
foot-race backward plumb to the rear door
where i hits my shoulders first followed by
the rest of my anatomy makin a sound like
the couplin-up of an engine on a train of
cars kinda clunkety clinkety dankt
through the haze i sees dirty shirt fade
out through the front doorway and i seen
wick smith climb up a post where he hangs
harness he got hold of the harness peg
and tries to lift himself up but the peg
busted and he landed back on the floor
under two sets of heavy harness

  i got up and went weavin down the
stable feelln kinda light and airy i seen
wick come up from under that harness and
go gallopin out of the place with a horse
when east met west	

collar around his neck and a set of tugs
sailin out behind holdin a hame in each
hand like a man carryin two flags

  i fell down twice before i got outside
where i found dirty and wick wick got
a tug caught in the sidewalk and aint got
sense enough to let loose of the hame
there he is yankin and haulin while
dirty is standin in front of him legs wide
apart wavin his hat in wicks face and
yellin

 whoa whoa whoa you-fool

  i fell over the tug and sat down on the
edge of the sidewalk dirty manages to
get wick calmed down and we looks each
other over dirty has got a pair of sleeves
on but no shirt his jiggly eye does a lot
of cavortin as he looks at me

  i never expected to see any of us alive
says he

  you dont need to start cheerin says i

what in-was the matter wick

  ignorance snorts dirty if i didnt
know any more natural history than that
id hang my head in shame wick you
tied him up did yuh well by golly you
ort to find out which is the head end of a
elephant you tied him by the tail

  well i-i-i-i tut-tied him wails wick
ends dont mean nothin to me they
both hang down the only danged way i
can tell which is which is to give it some hay
and see which end turns toward it he
didnt kill either one of yuh did he

  dont give gunga din any credit says
i if that back door hadnt been shut id
be in canada right now go back and
make pets of them things if you must but
spare me from havin anythin more to do
with em

  we helped wick back into the stable
stole a bottle of horse liniment and went
home to recuperate dirty walks like his
rudder was cramped just a little and im
kinda reared back to take the strain off my
shoulders hips and ankles

        it was kinda late that evenin
when me and dirty limped up to the
efejs mint hall and found piperock as-
sembled magpie is on the plat-
form and the argument seems to be gettin
warm on the platform with him is mrs
wick smith and miss jasmine greenbaum
when she sees us she hops off the platform
comes and leads me and dirty up to the
front of the room and asks us to sit down

  these two gentlemen have offered to
help me in this says she they have the
interests of piperock at heart i know they
are brave and full of courage and for that

reason i have selected them  

  brave and full of courage snorts
yuma yates full of rheumatism from
the way they walk

  im goin to remember most everythin
i hear said here says dirty thats re-
mark number one yuma

  my list shows number one for yuma
yates says i

  magpie hitches up his belt and moves
to the edge of the platform where he glares
at me and dirty shirt

  threats are out of order he tells us
piperock is passin from such things
from now onward we are promoters of
brotherly love-not battle heed this
and save yourself trouble we welcome
both to the fold and thank yuh for offerin
yore assistance to miss greenbaum sin-
cerely yours piperock chamber of com-
merce

  in reply to yore letter of today says i
i can say that yore fold dont appeal to us
so am sendin it back by return mail sin-
cerely yours ike harper and dirty shirt
jones p s and if you dont know what
i mean-ask us

  magpie glares at us for several moments
and then turns to miss jasmine

  miss greenbaum says he i told you
that i was sure them two jiggers was drunk
when they offered to help yuh probably
theyll deny ever sayin it now

  dirty shirt hops to his feet

  magpie simpkins yore a-a-exag-
geratin things by golly we said wed
help miss greenbaum and well do it
anythin she asks us to do is jist the same
as done aint that right ike

  well says i i hate to have any-
body doubt that i dont know what im
sayin-drunk or sober im with you
dirty

  i knew it says miss greenbaum i
knew they would do it for me it isnt
often that i make a mistake in human
nature when i first saw these two gentle-
men something told me that they were to
be depended upon mr harper and mr
jones i thank you

  yore welcome says dirty you
sure are awful welcome

  well now that weve settled that part
i

adventure



of it i move that we adjourn tomorrow
will be spent in preparin things weve
got a lot of work to do scenery youll
bring yore autymobile in tomorrow

  scenery sims admits that he will
scenery is a little thin son of a gun with a
e-string voice and owns the only horseless
vehicle in yaller rock county

  the ladies will be busy on their cos-
tumes says magpie and there will be
much decoratin to be did the time is
kinda short to complete all the details but
it is goin to be the biggest thing ever pulled
off in the west our grandchildren will be
proud of us

  yours wont be says dirty shirt

  its kind of a mean remark bein as mag-
pie never was married nobody laughed
but those directly behind us kinda eased
themselves aside out of the line of fire

  magpie shook his head and polished the
nail of his trigger finger on his right ear

  weve got to be meek says he  the
meek shall inherit the earth 

  that wont be a -- of a lot of fun if
there aint nothin but meek ones left
says i

  therell be a- of a lot of earth to

divide too says dirty shirt

  and thats all we knew about the meetin
ive got a hunch that dirty spoke up too
quick i told him that theyve been arguin
about me and him before we got there but
he dont care there aint a chance to
steal them animals for paradise even if
we was so inclined-which we aint-so we
decided to let nature take its course

  early the next mornin we finds magpie
paintin a big sign he aint noways ar-
tistic but readable at the top is one
word in letters two feet high-

pageant

  and just below that is two more big
words- op progress

  whats that magpie asks dirty shirt

  depictin says magpie wipin some
black paint out of his mustache the prog-
ress of piperock pageant means a high-
toned parade there has been parades be-
fore but this is the first pageant if you
two fellers will go up to wick smiths
house youll probly find mrs smith and
miss greenbaum workin on yore costumes
they was goin to make em first thing
today

  our costumes i asks whyfor cos-
tumes for us magpie

  have to have em ike

  oh well if we have to have em

  me and dirty spells out the next thing on
the list

when east meets west
the east is amazed at the

progress of the west

 they mingle like brothers

the coming of the white man
victory

the spirit of piperock-
progress

dont forget the big dance
at the mint hall

thatchers
combined orchestra
will furnish the strains
and scenery

sims will do the calun
come one and all

two dollars per each
will cover
the pageant and dance

piperock
chamber of commerce

           magpie simpkins
           president

  we found wick smith at the store he
hoodled hassayampa into takin charge of
the animals again and is runnin his own
store but he aint cheerful

  tomorrow is labor day says he with
tears in his voice i ort to be happy i
spose cause the proceeds of the pag-unt
is to help pay me for them animals but
somehow i cant seem to rend the veil as
old testament says and see the silver
linin

  aw itll be all right says dirty
parades aint much to worry about
thasso wick squints at dirty
youve survived some of our parades
aint yuh dirty

  yeah but youve got to figure that
piperock is civilized it aint noways what
she used to be wick right now piperock
is meek and mild

  ill betcha nods wick well i still
has hopes but-i dunno i cant quite
figure out my wife lookin like a statoo of
when east met west

 victory nor i cant figure out mrs pete
 gonyer and mrs mighty jones depictin

progress my - my wife dont look

 like victory

 you aint never won a battle from her
 yet have yuh i asks

 no thats a cinch well mebbe itll be
 all right you fellers aint got no easy
 chore yoreselves

 we aint i asks what have we got
 to do with it wick

 you two depicts the east ike anyway
 thats what theyve proclaimed for yuh

 - i dont look like no east snorts

 dirty

 i dont think i do either says i any-
 way i aint seen nobody from the east that

 looks a-of a lot like me how does she

 come that were inflicted with this idea
 wick

 dont ask me my- it aint none

 of my doins ive got all the grief i can
 stand you better ask magpie or jasmine
 they fixed it all up between em

 do we wear costumes asks dirty
 search me my wife does mosquito-

bar my- can yuh see my wife in a

 mosquito-bar dress

 id like to says dirty

 and then we left wick hadnt ought to
 be so finicky his wife is about five feet
 four inches tall and weighs two hundred and
 fifty she also wheezes considerable in her
 talk mrs gonyer is six feet two inches
 tall and so danged thin that she rattles
 when she walks mrs mighty jones aint
 no taller than mrs smith and she dont
 weigh a hundred

 me and dirty dont get much
 satisfaction around that town
 magpie goes to paradise to ad-
 vertise the affair and to probably
 do a lot of braggin about himself we runs
 into scenery sims who has his eyes focused
 on the wine when it is red and he aint ex-
 actly what youd call coherent

 i-i aint much he tells us tearful-like
 we agrees with him which dont help
 him none

 i cant do nothin he tells us

 - that aint news agrees dirty

 everybody knows that

 in the pay-jint says he i want to
 be somethin

 all right says i you be a hump in
 the road for the wagons to run over

  thats all right fr you two pelicans
says he youve got things to do ive
been shoved aside thats what ive been
done to by gosh mebbe piperock is
progressin but im right where i was a
week ago have a drink

  we would in fact we had several we
got to a point where dirty gets to braggin
about bein east he orates that hes also
effete magpie comes back from paradise
all swelled up over himself and invades
bucks place

  theyll come he tells the world
paradise will be here in copious gobs
from curlew well poll a big majority and
therell be a sprinklin from yaller horse
i prognosticate that piperock will hold
about all there is in yaller rock county
we has spread the gospel of progress and
the world responds

  has paradise got her animals yet
asks buck

  not yet mike pelly tells me that
theyre on the way its goin to be nip and
tuck between us towns well ive got to go
and see how things is goin is pete and
yuma workin on that float

  all day says buck itll be a dinger

  float says dirty my- theyre

ignorant ike there aint water enough
in this town to float a cork weve done
give our word to see that this here pe-rade is
a howlin success but after its over me and
you starts a pilgrimage i sicken of the
flesh-pots jack-pots et cettery long
may she wave lets have another libation
to old man backus

  and thats the way she went bill
thatcher and his orchestra showed up a
little later on-a bull-fiddle a squeeze-
organ and a jews-harp bills boy ham is
the squeeze-organist and old frenchy
deschamps is doin the moanin on the harp

  kinda wanted t know what kind of
music magpie wanted us to play explains
bill weve got all kinds

  you fellers graduated from sweet
marie asked dirty

  thats good music says bill kinda
indignant-like if yuh dont like that we
can play it any old way you want it

  some of paradise comes that night and
among em is the gang from the cross j
chuck gets me aside and asks how were
cornin on the animal stealin i points out
the difficulties showin him how close pipe-
rock is guardin their zoo
adventure

  get em durin the parade says chuck
everybody will be interested in that
dontcha see

  cant be did says i im part of the
parade

  what part are you ike

  im half of the east end says i now
you know as much as i do

  whos guardin em now ike

  i aint sure but i reckon hassayampa is
on duty

  chuck goes away leavin me to nod at
the bartender and lean against dirty shirt
then cometh polecat perkins and his
pack of high-class mongrels hes got
eight of em all on ropes and they proceeds
to tangle themselves around our legs

  greetins everybody says polecat
lay down dogs

  polecat joins our convention and gets
enthusiastic over the fact that tomorrow is
labor day and that were goin to have a
jollification

  take them dogs outside orders buck

my- this aint no doggery pole cat

take em away so folks will have a chance to
git to the bar

  just about that time hassayampa harris
comes into that saloon i dunno how far he
jumped from the outside but i know he
scraped his head on the top of the doorway
and landed plumb in the middle of the room
yeeow-w-w-w look out he yelps
right behind hassayampa comes cleo-
patra she comes among us like a striped
streak hits in the middle of the room lands
on the pool table and goes plumb out
through the back door which has just been
opened by mighty jones mightys feet
flip up where his hat had been and over him
goes polecats flock of dogs each one tryin
to yell louder than the rest

  thats our tiger explodes buck

 you-you can huh-have it pants
hassayampa

  how did it get loose

 go and ask it i-i was talkin to
chuck warner at the front door of the stable
when all to once i hears somebody yell and
here comes cleopatra

 somebody yell snorts buck by
golly ill bet some of that paradise gang
turned her loose while you was at the front
door git down there everybody before
they turn em all loose

  they all went down there except me and
dirty and buck they could turn em

loose as far as me and dirty are concerned
a few minutes after theyre gone old testa-
ment and muley bowles comes in testa-
ment aint got no hat and his coat is split up
the back muley dont track very well and
hes got a swellin over one eye

    in the midst of life we are in death   says
testament indicatin that he dont want
his lemonade straight

  buck looks em over

  you two been fightin each other he
asks

  it-it was a mistake says muley
drinkin the water and pourin his liquor in
the cuspidor i thought testament was
a-a-

  he thought i was a door finished
testament and tried to go through me
perhaps we had better go home muley

 yeah-and stay home says muley
painful-like

  they went out just before the crowd came
back it seems that gunga din and sahara
are all right but they left five guards in the
stable

  we found a hat said mighty has-
sayampa said that they aint fed that tiger

that night it will be sufficient to say that
mornin came apace the sun came up in its
usual way and among us was brotherly love

tion is sweet to the civilized

tors takes our guns away and leads us down

i sets up on that bed and looks at
the dangest person i ever seen
he was settin there lookin at me hes
kind of a dirty brown-complected hombre
with somethin white wrapped around his
head and his body is covered with a striped
gown of some kind

  i bats my eyes a couple of times but he
dont disappear

tion

right then and there i marks an x after
my name for a temperance vote

  yessir im dead says the person
ive had delirium tremens enough times
to know that this aint it

  i looks across the room and sees another
jigger of the same brand then i starts to
get out of bed intendin to head for the door
and this second dirty-faced thing moves
right along with me ive been lookin in a
mirror then i lifts one hand to my face

the turpentine stings like a lot of bees i
opened my mouth and i cant get it shut

  hrah for- wails dirty whos

fraid of fire

  we follers em up to the corner of holts
hotel and there we finds gunga din and

yer olaf hansen hassayampa harris

of it which is knowed as the west meetin

ered wagon that is the cornin of the
white man the injuns act surprized
behind his wagon comes scenery sims
autymobeel which has been made into a
fleat and on it is the three figures which
represent victory and the progress of

  i let em put me up on the back of that
india-rubber ox which aint wearin saddle
nor bridle behind my animal is dirty
shirt settin on the hump of sahara his
face twisted kinda funny hes got a pair
of reins to hang on to

  just then gunga din starts ahead there
i

adventure

aint nothin i can do but set there and let
things go we went surgin around the
comer and into the main street yaller
rock county sure was there every hitch-
rack is packed with horses and between the
racks and the middle of the street stands the
population of a county waitin for us to
show up

  they lets out a cheer when we showed up
and we aint more than halfway to em
when up the street comes old cod liver oil
and runnin dog both of em decked out in
war-paint nose-paint war-bonnets and
ridin painted ponies

  i reckon it was a sight worth seein
honest to gosh i sure did feel aboriginal
i was stoical too the only emotion i can
show is with my right leg-the left one has
gone to sleep then the east met the west

  we got within twenty feet of each other
before them pinto horses got a good look at
gunga din and sahara cod liver oils
pinto just spread its legs bawled like a calf
-and fell down sendin the old buck into a
somersault almost under gunga din run-
nin dogs pinto turns around on one hind
leg shuckin old runnin dog and went
past us like a streak

  gunga din reached down wrapped his
trunk around cod liver oil and stood the
old boy on his head twenty feet away

  yee-ow-w-w yelps liniment lucas
some show

  and into it all comes pete gonyer drivin
a team of broncs hitched to a covered
wagoa he is the cornin of the white
man he came-ill say that much for
him the yellin is too much for that team
of broncs and here comes pete feet braced
against the front-gate of that wagon haulin
short on the lines while behind him billows
that wagon-cover like a anchored balloon

  runnin dog has got to his feet with the
war-bonnet over one eye and blood in the
other one

  whool he screams hyas masahchie
mokst la tet

  it was the first elephant he ever seen and
he called it a big evil with two heads

  there aint no chance for me to move
gunga din out of the path of them two
broncs so i sets supine and lets death rush
down upon us but it dont rush all the
way

  about twenty feet away them two broncs
get their first look at the east and they
dont like it they dig their heels into

that hard street set down in their harness
and out of that cloud of dust comes pete
gonyer all spread out like a flyin squirrel
and he lands all spraddled out on the head
of gunga din still hangin onto his lines

  as old judge steele might say-pandy-
ammonium reigns

  the two broncs regains their equili-
brium ducks sideways and tries to go
around us they were goin pretty good
when they took up the slack on them fines
and pete gonyer lifted right off the dome of
gunga din sailed off through the air and
butted dirty shirt plumb off his camel he
not only butted him off but took him along

  then gunga din lifted his trunk high in
the air and bugles loud and free-

  ra-a-a-a te ta-a-a-a ta ta-a-a-a

         right then i want to get down
 dnt reckn that any harper
i i ever	that wanted to get

          down as badly as i do but there
aint no safety on the ground every horse
at them hitch-racks are heavin and surgin
folks yelpin i want to yell but that
darned paint has set with my mouth half
open and all i can do is say-

  hoo hoo hoo like a darned owl

  then cometh victory-and progress
pete gonyer has made a riggin to fit over
the top of scenery sims automobile kinda
like a platform and theres a railin all
around it decorated with flags and colored
cloth the driver aint in sight and the
danged thing looks like a runaway raft

  on the front of the arrangement stand
mrs wick smith all gauded up in cheese-
cloth and a silver crown which is settin
down over one ear kinda rakish-like one
hand is grippin the rail while the other
hangs to a big banner

  behind her stands mrs gonyer dressed
in white tryin to hold up one hand like an
injun givin a peace-sign and hangin onto
her is mrs mighty jones wearin a night-
gown and a pair of paper wings one of
which has climbed up on her shoulder
makin her look like a broken-winged duck

  i seen all this in a lot less time than it
takes to tell it the thing is cornin too
danged fast i sabe that much and i know
that an automobile dont scare at elephants
a runaway horse goes past me hits its ramp
against the platform of victory and prog-
ress and skids the thing aside

  mrs smith goes down in a lump and
when east met west t



mrs gonyer lands on her knees with that
one hand still up in the air then victory
and progress hits the east

  they knocked gunga din loose from the
street but they didnt remove him i got
mrs smith in my arms but mrs mighty
jones went past me so fast that i didnt
have no chance to make a collection then
gunga din got his four feet on to the terry-
firma agin and started out

  he bowed his head put it against that
float and started for bucks saloon front
i seen magpies head come up from among
the wreckage and he starts hammerin
gunga din over the head with a piece of
two-by-four but he might as well a kissed
him for all the good it done

  wick smith comes gallopin alongside of
us yellin-

  leggo my wife leggo my wife dang
you ike-leggo her

  tell it to her i yelps back at him
you-fool i aint doin the holdin

  the rear wheels of that equipage hits the
sidewalk lifts up real sudden and we begins
to shove that whole works plumb through
bucks saloon front it was then that i
managed to get loose from another mans
wife and proceeds to fall backward off that
elephant

 i dunno what in- sahara was doin

right behind gunga din unless he was sup-
posed to be there but i do know that i lit
kinda folded up across his long neck and he
starts to run with me we went around in a
circle three times before i fell off and that
-camel walked all over me

  then i sets up in that dusty street and
tries to see what is goin on horses are
runnin around like they was in a circus
ring and some of em are draggin wagons
and buggies behind em which makes the
street a dangerous place for to be one
wagon circled the street twice before i no-
tices that dirty shirt is standin up in the
wagon kinda balancin himself with his
arms spread out wide

  then the wagon hit the sidewalk and
dirty turned over twice before landed sit-
tin down on the sidewalk i managed to
limp and crawl over to him his good eye
is plumb closed and the bad one wont keep
still

  hes singin soft and low and kinda
beatin time with that jiggly eye i has to
listen real close but above the roar of de-
struction i hears his singin-

littul birdie in the tree in the tree in the tree
littul birdie in the tree-e-e-e-e sing a song for me-

   e-e-e-e

  there aint no tree dirty says i

  aint there he asks soft-like there
ort to be-theres so-many birds

  over around bucks place theres folks
yellin to beat four of a kind and some mis-
guided jigger starts shootin i can see that
there aint no regular doorway left in bucks
saloon-just an openin about ten feet wide

  just about that time gunga din comes
around the corner he aint got nobody
on his back now but hes got a chair hooked
around one hind leg he runs into the
hitch-rack tried to go under it and lifts it
plumb out of the ground this kinda makes
him sore so he wraps his trunk around one
of the posts and starts for us packin and
draggin it along with him while on the far
end of it is tied a piebald bronc from para-
dise

  the most of the crowd stampeded for the
mint hall wicks store and other places of
safety and it sure dont take long to clear
the street of spectators i sabe that gunga
din is on a regular bust so i picks dirty
shirt up in my arms and staggers toward
bucks place

  i aint in no shape to pack anybody
cause my right leg acts too short which
makes me circle a little to the right and im
close to gunga din before i realize it

  theres just a whap and a rip and out-
side of dirtys headgear hes as naked as the
day he was bom gunga din shucked him
like an ear of corn but dirty dont know
it and i dont care so we staggers on
through the haze

  we fell into bucks place and it dont
take a normal man to see that everythin
aint right in there

  old testament tilton is settin up on
what used to be the back-bar squattin
there like a wise old owl lookin over the
world settin there like a statue sayin
nothin piled up against the bar is what
is left of the float buck is flat on his back
with his feet up over the pool-table which
has been moved over against the wall

  all to once that mass which used to be
the float begins to heave upward and from
among the busted two-by-fours twisted
wires and colored cloth cometh sahara

how in - that camel got mixed up in

that float i dont know but there he is

  he comes out of there plumb decorated


adventure

and hanging to his tail like grim death
comes magpie simpkins the president of
piperocks chamber of commerce

  magpie has still got on one boot a suit
of red underwear and the crown of his hat
and in his eyes is a stern resolve and be-
hind him pawin out of the wreck comes
wick smith they all gets clear of the
wreck and sahara stops wick has a two-
foot piece of two-by-four in his hands and
he braces his feet far apart

  mum-magpie says he kinda thin-like
you has made me a widder man gol ding
yuh

  but magpie dont hear it his mind is
far behind that pageant of progress he
bows and kinda smiles as he says

  the wheel of progress is turnin and
wo unto him who gits under the tire the
people of piperock has risen in their might
unleashed their bonds which has held them
in darkness-

  tunkl wick smiths two-by-four ended
the speech

  you didnt have to blame him entirely
wick says i

  he turns and looks at me kinda weavin
on his feet

  you he whispers you come bub-
back wheres my wife

  i dunno wick

  you had her dang you i seen you
huggin her

  i seen that piece of scantlin cornin but
didnt have flexibility enough to dodge i
distinctly heard it clank against my head
and then i finds myself out in the street
again i can hear a lot of dogs wailin and
i wonders if i can hear this because ive
gone to the dogs aint it funny what a
feller will think about in a case like that

  a lot of folks are yellin at somebody or
somethin so i sets up and concentrates on
the present a bullet digs into the dirt be-
side me but i dont mind i kinda won-
ders why theyre shootin at me of course
then somethin hooks me off the ground and
begins to give me a ride

  i managed to get one eye open and finds
that im on one end of that hitch-rack and
the motive power is furnished by gunga
din theyve picked me up in the angle
between one post and the top-pole and the
friction on that part of me which wasnt on
the pole was somethin awful

  then gunga din let out another of them
awful bugles shucked the hitch-rack and

headed for bucks place again-and hangin
to the slack skin of gunga dins rear end
was cleopatra behind them came pole-
cat perkins pack of hounds run to a
frazzle but still able to stagger on and wail
plenty loud and long

  them dogs has run that tiger all night
and it aint no wonder that the tiger is
huntin for somethin to climb on to right
into the wreck of bucks place they went
while the crowd which is located in places
of safety yelled shot and generally decided
that-was havin a recess

        its only about five minutes
since east met west but there
has been several things come to
pass gunga din has gone back
into bucks place tryin to get rid of cleo-
patra when here comes chief cod liver
oil packin an old sharps rifle the old
war-whoop sure must a been fortified
against fear by much flavorin extract
cause he heads straight for bucks shat-
tered entrance soundin his tribal war-
whoop regular

  i got to my feet i reckon they were my
feet there aint no feelin in em but they
hold me up so they must be mine an
armless man could count all the harper
heroes on the fingers of his hands but just
the same i goes pawin toward bucks place
to see what i can salvage from gunga din
cleopatra and cod liver oil

  i dont quite get there when cod liver
oil comes out he came out of there end
over end missed me about a foot and stood
on his head and shoulders in the street
his sharps lit just outside the doorway so
i picked it up and went in

  cleopatra is settin on what used to be the
end of bucks mahogany bar her mouth
wide open and her eyes shut gunga din
is standin in the middle of the room with
one hind foot on magpies pant-leg and
sahara is half-in and half-out of a rear win-
dow and every time gunga din weaves
the whole building shakes

  dirty shirt has got to his feet and there
he stands plumb out of clothes kinda
rockin on his feet and grinnin foolish

  dud-do somethin whispers magpie
aint nobody goin to do somethin

  call on the chamber of commerce
says i

  from under a smashed card-table wick
smith shoves up his head hes got the
when east met west



brim of his hat in his teeth but manages to
work it loose with his tongue

  i give up he wheezes i know when
ive got enough

  old testament is still settin on the back-
bar but now he shakes loose and falls into
cleopatra he kinda takes that big striped
cat into a lovin embrace but cleopatra
yowled once kicked testament backward
and jumped straight at me

  i throwed up that old sharps took a
wing-shot at cleopatra and then a great
weight settled upon me i aint no fighter
none of my family ever won any diamond
belts but there never was a harper that
wouldnt fight to save his own life and i
sure went into a clinch with that tiger

  my eyes are too full of dust and pain for
me to see just how the battle is cornin
we just kept on fightin thassall once we
got separated and it takes us quite a while
to get together again but we did i cant
see a danged thing and i dont reckon cleo-
patra can either so we locates each other
by sense of smell

  i dunno how long we fought scientists
would probably differ as to how long a man
and a tiger can fight without one or both of
em dyin i aint got no feelin left within
me i reckon im kinda primitive just
now and i fights with tooth and daw i
hears voices around me kinda cheerin so
i puts up a supreme effort as it were and
feels the tiger go limp

 my- i hears dirty gasp hoarse-

like theyre still at it

  i licked him-her says i

  i aint got more than enough breath to
say that and then i kinda passed out

  it seems like i heard somebody say

  let him alone dang yuh he done jist
what ive wanted to see done for a long
time

  it was probably quite a some time before
i woke up again for quite a while i cant
figure out just where i am and whats goin
on i seem to be layin across somethin
that heaves and surges a heap i manages
to get one eye open and discovers that im
on my stummick across a saddle

  out in front of me and the horse is a
queer-lookin figure its got on a pair of
overalls which wont stay up barefooted
bareheaded it looks back at me and i
recognize dirty shirt by his jiggly eye

  then i slides off and sels down beside
the trail

  where we goin i asks

  dirty comes back and sits down beside
me

  it dont make no difference does it
he asks they said that we was mostly
to blame so i took you away from em and
went away it wasnt our fault ike but
they have to blame somebody

  magpie was mostly to blame says i
we done the best we could i dunno
what you done dirty but i know i saved
piperock from a lot of heartaches

  you sure did ike says dirty

  that critter would a been the ruination
of piperock

  thats a cinch ike but the worst of
it is you only stops the plague temp-
rarily

  thasso says i i done my best
dirty shirt i wish i had the hide for a
souvenir

  dirty looks queer-like at me

  i dunno says he kinda sad-like a
shock sometimes causes a feller to jerk back
to his cannibal ancestors

  i dunno what hes talkin about but im
too bunged up to care much and my face is
beginnin to crack

  how in-did it finish i asks

  all right ike the animals all hived
up in the livery-stable and wick smith
sold em to paradise

  the - he did i exclaimed or as

much of an exclamation as i can use in my
condition and didnt the piperock cham-
ber of commerce stop him

  there was only one to vote agin it-
and he was too danged near death to even
squawk they never even give him credit
for tryin to save the tiger i seen it all
ike when you lifted that old sharps to
shoot cleopatry magpie got loose from
gunga din and fell into yuh

  uh-uh-huh says i feelin weak and
then what did i do to the tiger dirty
nothin a-tall the wheels of progress
got to turnin and magpie got under the
tire thasall in the language of magpie
simpkins i wouldnt be surprized to see
piperock one of the big cities of the world
well says i in the language of ike
harper whose spirit liver lights and giz-
zard has been busted to make a piperock

holiday lets get to-out of here before

the place grows too big i dont want to
even be seen in the suburbs

  but she hasnt grown any since
 the chief prays

         by larry oconner

 rd god thy will controls the winds thy hand can still the seas

thy love condones our mortal sins-forgies our trespasses

think not id dare to interfere in plan of thine o lord

but yell obsairve weve with us here two hundred souls aboard

puir feckless loons wha dinna ken thy mysteeries o god-

they wadna know a clincher-pin fra yon connectin-rod

theyve trusted to our seamanship the skippers skill and mine

to see them safely through this trip across these seas of thine

not een a sparrow falls to earth but what tis seen of thee

it isna mine to judge their worth-these lives depend on me

i rate my wark too high mayhap yet when alls said and done

my jobs to see yon heap o scrap performs her scheduled run

and should i fail to keep that trust the blame comes back to me

that leaves this helpless chunk o rust the sport o wind and sea

thou knowest lord how we ha wrought-we dinna seek for praise-
whilst all thine angry seas have sought to end our mortal days

a surge a broken pincher-pin a bent eccentric-rod

and over a the fearfu din that spells thy wrath o god

to heat and shape that rod again twas no small task ye mind

whilst tossed about like bowlin pins our eyes wi sweat half blind

and so for fifty mortal hour wi hand and brain and nerve
we strove and now were under power she knocks but she will serve
the end is aye within thy hand our skill is but a spark

but still a man ye understand must strive to do his wark

not but the skippers used his wits above there on the deck

wi every life-boat smashed to bits the bridge a total wreck

seas swept the funnels from their stays and breached the starboard rail
oh aye its no childs play to face a north atlantic gale

the wheel-house went that second morn wi four hands by the board
theyd wives na doot their loss to mourn- thy will be done o lord

the crews a scurvy pack o thieves-dock rats and gutter spawn

but still theyre white and times like these they curse but carry on
not like these slant-eyed yellow men ive stokin for me here

inclined to mutiny ye ken and unco swift to fear


the chief prays



ou aye they dinna cost so much but hap things gang askew

a crew wi anglo-saxon guts are worth their extra screw

ye saw them try to quit her when that bilge-pump piston seized-

wed little time to fritter then wi treevialities

six inches on the floor at most just slosh in wi the roll

whats that that men should quit their posts theyre here to shovel coal
our spanners taught them new desires losh man theyre awfu swine

eh well they bided by their fires- we must ha discipline

our sails they lasted half an hour cheap smoke-burned rotten frail

our owners furnish us wi power why spend good cash for sail

they owners lord i wadna sit to judge my fellow men

but an he be not short o wit a man must think ye ken

theyll bide there safe ashore the whiles wi cars and boards o trade

and count wi smug and oily smiles the profits they ha made

i wad we had them wi us now ill warrant theyd ha learned
somewhat ere sightin land of how those deevidends are earned

yell note the way those stay-bolts lift wi every lurch and roll

see how yon fish-plates girn and shift- they even skimp on coal

and fill our bunkers up wi rot that cakes the grates amain

tut tut i canna voice my thochts wiout id grow profane

they send us out wiout repairs cheap gear and coolie crews

they must not risk that gold of theirs weve only lives to lose

insurance aye for twice her cost why should they be annoyed
if common seamens lives are lost look what shed bring from lloyds

now lord if yell but stay thy hand sheathe thy destroying sword-
think not id wish to chaffer and to bargain wi the lord-

but these four days o roll and rack of race and strain and knock

ha crippled us and oertaxed this cranky outworn box

i dinna ask for summer sun nor calm and peaceful days

here on this north atlantic run wi winter under way

but if o lord it suits thy will abate this wind and sea

and leave the issue to the skill thou gavest unto me

we come and go at thy behest nor reason why nor when

a man may only do his best- thy will be done amen
   our camp-fire came into being may   with our june issue and since then
its fire has never died down many have gathered about it and they are of all classes
and degrees high and low rich and poor adventurers and stay-at-homes and from all
parts of the earth some whose voices we used to know have taken the long trail
and are heard no more but they are still memories among us and new voices are
heard and welcomed

   we are drawn together by a common liking for the strong clean things of out-of-
doors for word from the earths far places for man in action instead of caged by cir-
cumstance the spirit of adventure lives in all men the rest is chance

   but something besides a common interest holds us together somehow a real com-
radeship has grown up among us men can not thus meet and talk together without
growing into friendlier relations many a time does one of us come to the rest for facts
and guidance many a close personal friendship has our camp-fire built up between
two men who had never met often has it proved an open sesame between strangers
in a far land

   perhaps our camp-fire is even a little more perhaps it is a bit of leaven working
gently among those of different station toward the fuller and more human understand-
ing and sympathy that will some day bring to man the real democracy and brotherhood
he seeks few indeed are the agencies that bring together on a friendly footing so many
and such great extremes as here and we are numbered by the hundred thousand now

    if you are come to our camp-fire for the first time and find you like the things we
like join us and find yourself very welcome there is no obligation except ordinary
manliness no forms or ceremonies no dues no officers no anything except men and
women gathered for interest and friendliness your desire to join makes you a member

if any of you can throw further
light on the following it will cer-
tainly make interesting reading
who was this white giant among
the western indians a century or so ago
its so wonderful a tale that if it were pre-
sented as a fiction story wed hesitate to use
so improbable a hero as this eight-footer
yet the evidence mr weaver brings for-
ward points at least to a possibility in fact

 visalia california

  can any member of the camp-fire or any of the
staff or corps of the magazine throw any light on the
identity of a hunter or trapper of almost gigantic
size who disappeared unaccountably probably be-
tween  and  in the far west his remark-
able stature must have made him well known and of
great repute among the early mountain men

yhe reason for asking is as follows nearly thirty
years ago a small party of hunters were storm
bound in an indian camp in the lower sierra nevada
in california a member of the party who could
speak a few indian words made a hit with a very
old squaw one of the oldest in appearance that any
of the hunters ever saw and she tried to give us a
line on the history of past storms other white hunt-
ers and some severe sickness we could not make
out if she was relating events in her childhood or
during the childhood of her mother the childhood
part was plain enough through her signs but the
word meaning mother was so frequently used and
our knowledge of her language as was her knowl-
edge of ours so slight that we could not be certain

  at any rate the gist of her relation was that a great
many years before while her tribe was living in an-
other section of the same mountain range another
party of four white men one of them of tremendous
stature had come to her camp in the midst of a
storm they were the first white men she or her


the camp-fire



people had seen and they were made welcome
they stayed for some time and then in some way
sickened and died first one or two who were buried
by their companions and then the last who were in-
terred by the indians in the same manner her
talk made us understand that the mode of burial
was strange to her people her effort to make us
understand her was pretty successful notwithstand-
ing the fact that we had no more than a dozen words
in common and that she was too old and feeble to
do much pantomime work the uncommon size of
one of the early white men his death and burial
and the long time elapsed since the coming of this
party were plain if the event occurred during her
childhood it could not well have been later than 
or  even allowing for the fact that the indian
women age early and look older than they are in
many cases if during the childhood of her mother
the date would run back possibly to near  as
early as that or within a few years at least i be-
lieve the hudsons bay co had men in touch with
the pacific coast

ntow many years after our party listened to the
indians tale one of the members was engaged
in the construction of a road about twenty miles
from the site of the indian camp where we had taken
shelter and a cut disclosed the grave or graves of
four humans a button or two was found no other
relics but enough to prove the occupants of the
graves to have been white-nor were they buried
in the position the indians give their dead-and
among the bones were those of a giant these
placed as well as possible by the finders showed one
to have been near eight feet in height and with
teeth as one of the finders said nearly as big as a
horses exposure to the air caused the disinte-
gration of the skeletons in a very short time and the
whole were cast into another hole and left without
tear or marker merely the last bed of an unknown
adventurer and his pals-morve l weaves

something from talbot
mundy in connection with his
complete novel in this issue his
conception of julius caesar has
stirred up quite a lot of argument and well
try to hear the pros and cons at camp-fire
pretty much in full before were through
lets keep open-minded until we hear the
evidence on both sides

  what appeals to me most about this period of
history is that there is almost nothing definitely
known about it of course there are plenty of
theories but most of those are contradictory al-
though for the most part based on julius caesars
commentaries but it can not be too often pointed
out that julius cassar was beaten in britain-twice
in  and  b c and therefore that his account
is tainted to put it mildly by deliberate and very
skillful advocacy of his own case

tphere is plenty of room for opinion in view of
the scarcity of known facts about tie britons
for instance not even the most dogmatic and cock-
sure historians of the type who wrote text-books
when i was at school pretended to know whence

the britons actually came but it seems certain
that those in the southeast of britain had been there
for at least three centuries at the time of csesars
invasion that they possessed a rather cultured al-
most ridiculously chivalrous fair-haired ruling caste
did not build with stone but were experts in meta
work such as bronze gold and silver marvelous
horsemen and were much given to rivalry it is also
suggestive that after cssars return to rome where
he was thoroughly ridiculed for his failure against
the britons british ornaments and even british
chariots with basket-work sides and bronze wheels
became the height of fashion-which is hardly likely
to have been the case if the britons were such
painted savages as some historians have tried to
make them out to be dont forget they defeated
caesar twice when he was at the height of a series
of successful campaigns and so severely that he
made no effort to return and conquer them

hphe coasts of britain and gaul were as close to-
gether as those of esgland and france today
in fine weather one coast can be seen from the other
along a shore-line of a hundred miles or so from
either side and again in fine weather the craziest
kind of cockleshell boat could cross the channel
without much danger i have myself sailed both
coast-lines in a sloop not thirty-five feet long
and i know men who have done it in open boats
so it seems to me ridiculous that britain should be
thought of as isolated from the known world at the
time of cesars invasion or at any other time
and in view of the fact that they had minted money
spoke a language almost identical with that of
northern gaul occasionally shared chiefs in com-
mon with the gauls as for instance the atrebates
and possessed a highly developed druidic philosophy
with its accompanying social system it seems highly
probable that they were not barbarians at all

por instance again scores of roads in britain
have been attributed to the romans which on
subsequent careful investigation show no trace of
roman origin although the romans may have re-
paired some of them and may have used others as a
base for their own magnificent lines of communica-
tion the britons did make roads and good ones
long before the romans conquered them

    the britons possessed tin iron gold pearls and
 traded in them receiving in exchange among other
 things purple dye which must have come from the
 mediterranean  they were in contact with what
 is commonly regarded although without too much
 proof as the highest civilization of that period
 they had a trading point at vectis probably the
 isle of wight where the tin was assembled in ingots
 and shipped in foreign bottoms there are refer-
 ences in the old testament isaiah to the isles of
 the sea and there is ground for supposing those
 isles were britain and ireland at any rate the
 theory is next to impossible to disprove

s to whether or not lunden london existed
as a town in csesars day opinions are about
equally divided i have chosen to assume it did
exist as caswallons capital for reasons that are too
long to give here in full but there is no doubt that
the thames existed and provided a safe convenient
anchorage for foreign ships ludgate hill is ludds
gate hill and ludd was a god of the britons the
site of st pauls cathedral must have been as


adventure

habitable and convenient then as now and it is at
least suggestive that important christian churches
are very often if not nearly always to be found on
the sites of previous pagan temples or places of wor-
ship add to that admittedly hazy argument two
facts that less than a hundred years ago some of the
stakes were still in place in the bed of the thames
placed there by caswallon and his men to hold the
ford near lunden against csesar and the nore the
thames estuary lay wide open to the eastward in-
viting commerce and invasion it is hardly likely
the britons would not have built a town and forti-
fied it at the one place where traders and sea-pirates
could disembark in the very heart of their country

and that brings up the subject of the north-
men and their ships-a long and equally con-
tentious one the written records of the north-
mens long-ships do not commence until two or
three hundred years later than the period of this
story and it seems to be assumed by some histo-
rians that the northmen developed a type of ship
and learned to navigate it suddenly at about the
time when the roman occupation of britain was
drawing to a close but this is so contrary to all
the teachings of history that i for one refuse to
consider it seriously neither customs architec-
ture ships nor geographical conditions are devel-
oped in a day or in a hundred years the clipper
ship for instance was the outcome of a thousand
years experience generation after generation of de-
signers adding some refinement until at last the al-
most perfect mistress of the seas was launched
from the ways of maine and massachusetts 

  the remains of viking ships discovered in sweden
and in england though admittedly of a period some-
what later than this story all show an exquisite
sweetness of line and sea quality that could not
possibly have been developed except by generations
of experience and there is no way of making that
kind of experience except by navigating rough seas
men do not navigate rough seas for amusement as
a rule but under the impulse of necessity or for the
sake of profit and conditions in norway sweden
and denmark must have been much the same as to
climate and geography as today in other words
the northmans harvests used to fail and he fared
forth in his beautifully constructed ships to seek
holding elsewhere britain - the humber the
wash and the mouth of the thames-lay openly
inviting with nothing but the steep and dangerous
north sea passage between him and plunder
which again brings us back to the britons

tjnless they had been something vastly re-
moved from savages they would surely have
been overwhelmed by the constant raids and inva-
sions in force that i believe took place undoubt-
edly as all historians admit there was an appreci-
able percentage of norse blood in the britons on the
east coast i infer from that that the britons were
able to absorb their prisoners and the occasional
raiders who made good their footing which is a sign
not of a barbarous people but of a rather highly cul-
tured one that treated prisoners humanely had no
objection to intermarriage with them and could
offer something better to the invader than the social
conditions he had left behind

  i take it for instance that if the american in-
dian had possessed on the whole a superior culture
to that of the white man who invaded his country

he would have absorbed the white man instead of
being overwhelmed by him britian even absorbed
the romans who became more british than the
britons and prided themselves on it in spite of
their loyalty to the rome that many of them never
saw

   the british culture whatever that was profound-
ly influenced the romans who came in contact with
it-swallowed the saxons angles and jutes later on
who in turn absorbed the normans each host of
invaders overran the country imposing new con-
ditions and new customs but the climate and some-
thing else perhaps the pagan culture of the druids
persisted-doubtless with changed names and ob-
literated details-through it all so i dont feel
guilty of anachronism when i show caswallon as a
gentleman not altogether unlike one of those mod-
em english squires-a little stupid a little insu-
lar but a perfect sportsman-who led his men t
death against the germans on the marne-talbot
mundy

 one of our comrades starts a
	snake argument with curator

ditmars of the bronx zoo and
offers to back it up he had
something to say about prohibition but
having given both sides a hearing at camp-
fire i think wed better lay off that sub-
ject at least for a while no no dont get
suspicious-at least nine-tenths of you
whove written in on that topic have been
on the same side of the fence as i

philadelphia

  im off for years ive been listening to the
steady crackle of arguments pro and con-hoop
snakes milk snakes anti-pistol laws prohibition
etc now listen to me

oincei was six years old ive played with snakes
since about fourteen ive studied their habits
am now twenty-nine

   when i start to figure it out i even surprize my-
self with the fact ive handled thousands of reptiles
which i caught bare-handed or with the aid of a
stick i never killed a reptile of any kind except-
ing the common water snakes which in my estima-
tion are deserving of death as they feed almost ex-
clusively on fish

  granted that ditmars knows his stuff-so do i
and if i feel like disagreeing with him grant me the
right

  eugene cunningham gives ditmars credit for the
statement we new york zoo have never induced
snakes to take an interest in milk

  have available a baby boa that drinks milk as
readily as water and seems fond of it though much
preferring live mice have fed milk to milk snakes
black snakes pine snakes com snakes after wit-
nessing dozens of them drink it i offer to prove
given sufficient time to get specimens by demon-
stration that these snakes will drink milk

ill ave two eye-witnesses to what i believe was a
thoroughly effective demonstration of a black
snake charming hypnotizing mesmerizing or what-
ever you choose to call it a bird into helplessness
and then swallowing said bird
the camp-fire



  ditmars claims fright renders the bird helpless or
makes it appear helpless this cant be true you
dont have to be a naturalist to know that a fright-
ened bird flies away from whatever frightens it

  when it comes to snakes milking the cows how-
ever chalk me up along with the rest of the authori-
ties in saying it isnt done nor are there any hoop
snakes a blue racer or whip snake sometimes gets
going down grade so fast he flops tail-end first and
turns a clumsy somersault but he never rolls in a
hoop if he tried such a stunt hed dislocate every
bone in his spinal column mr snake can nly
bend sideways with comfort

as to the poisonous snakes especially the cop-
perhead of which i now speak with painful in-
timacy when they bite you know it with sad and
immediate certainty one copperhead about 
inches long with half seconds injection in my wrist
gave the sensation of a red-hot poker being thrust
against the wrist then pressed all the way up my
arm to the shoulder you cant fix a ligature with
one hand if youre bit on the hand or forearm
theres only one thing to do-open the punctures
made by the fangs real wide to let the blood flow and
suck it out as fast as itll come this has to be done
quick to draw the poison out the way it went in
but you wont do it quick enough to stop the in-
tense pain no matter how ready you are to act i
know	

  the swelling of the arm was terrifyingly fast and
prolonged it took about twenty-four hours for the
arm to shrink to anything like normal somewhat
longer for the discoloration to disappear body and
head were hot painful and feverish terribly
thirsty believe that several gallons of water every
few hours helps wash the poison out of the system
however but to realize the terrific effects of snake
venom read the dept of agricultures pamphlet on
their findings in this respect

co there remains with us a large number of
serious  thinking people who because they see
the effect think they know the cause of crime they
do insist that by taking from us the only weapon
we have with which we can combat the murderer
and thug on equal terms well be setting the crim-
inal such a good example hell reform apple-
sauce

t detest spiders i once had a double handful
of puff adders horn toads and lizards as well as
several pocketfuls of turtles when i kicked what
looked like a fuzzy rock the fuzzy rock about as
big as my fist spread out into a reddish brown spider
the size of a plate-and slammed itself plop against
my leather-legging encased leg i kicked so hard
the leather legging slipped down over my shoe the
strap broke and it flew off the legging that is-for
the spider scampered away so quick it never knew
my leg had moved

  i saw a number of these spiders near el paso
often wondered if they were poisonous dont
think they were tarantulas for ive looked over some
caged specimens of the latter since then they were
plenty big though

any one that cares for any dope on the rep-
tiles of eastern-central states can sound me
out dont recall their latin names off-hand al-
ways have to look this up but the snake doesnt


crawl nor the turtle waddle hereabouts that i dont
know something about its habits

  for instance the striped water snake eats nothing
else but crayfish the long slender irish green
snake likes nothing so well as the hairless caterpil-
lars or worms that make lace-work of cabbage and
lettuce leaves wonder what the farmer would say
if he found the snakes belly full of mice or the bugs
he spends so much time and money exterminating
after he thoughtlessly killed it-one of the em-
bers v a grillet

shortly after he had been
made our ask adventure au-
thority for france one of our
comrades passed into the beyond
norman s goodsill of san diego califor-
nia died february  after an illness of only
a few hours though i had never met him
he was one of our readers with whom i had
become friends through correspondence
and i had come to admire him not only for
his personal qualities but for his stanch
clear-sighted americanism

  i know that camp-fire will rise to its
feet to wish him good faring over the long
trail

because it brings up a subject
we havent heard discussed at
camp-fire-and that it might be
just as well to have a look at im
passing the following letter on to you even
though the writer asked not to have his
name used with it also as some others
may have queried john webbs statement
about rations during the war it gives mr
webb a chance to back up his words

  in general however the line will be
drawn more strictly than ever against print-
ing any letters without printing their writ-
ers signatures there are heaven knows
plenty of good letters for camp-fire with
out using unsigned ones

  your story in camp-fire for february th about
mr stemmier and his present day work in a revival
of archery gets to me when i was a boy on the farm
in tennessee i now own there my father put bows
into our hands and ive always had a wish to do some
thing with it if opportunity ever offered now that
im in the tropics in business calling for some office
work i need exercise and i despise golf heretical
though that may be there doesnt seem to be quite
enough practical use about it so i want to write mr
stemmier if i may have his address

vou may be interested to know what im trying
in connection with some new york money
im trying to establish the feasibility of a modem
system of milk supply in the tropics if these peo-
ple especially children would drink more milk and


adventure

eat less meat they would be better nourished and
less susceptible to disease

  ive been pioneering in a business way all my life
and had promised myself to stop but the urge to
try out something new is hard to overcome

an ent the letter of john webb in the same
issue i want to come to the defense of my
branch of the u s army service in the war this
was the nutrition corps attached to the medical
corps it consisted of all the nutrition and food
experts they could get together not a great many
for knowledge of this subject was then even less
widely disseminated than now though owing
to the fixed character of the military mind this
corps had no chance to show what it could really do
to keep the grub for the boys good and plentiful it
did vastly more for them than had ever been done
before in a war and not only insisted on a well-
balanced and well-cooked ration but kept a vast
amount of bad food out of their victuals witness
that there was no embalmed beef scandal in this
war and that one gold fish contract was knocked
endways by this service and as i now recall prac-
tically all of the stuff kept out of circulation our
boys really suffered from hunger on the french and
british rations which were different and much less
ample and not balanced

  this may have been the reason mr webb a
sailor by the way and so with no first hand knowl-
edge of army rations was so besieged in overseas
ports by hungry soldiers and he ought not to write so
keerless like without exact knowledge criticism
without knowledge is easy-and abundant

  if you should see fit to publish any part of this let-
ter i dont see why you should dont use my name
its purpose is chiefly to get stemmlers address for
which i cant send you return postage obviously
but also i want to call down loose writing and inci-
dentally to call attention to a scientific achieve-
ment quite as important in its way as anything with
gas or h e-and a darned sight more useful to us
in ordinary times-and of which few people seem to
know-c b a late captain sanitary corps

 answer by john webb of our writers
    brigade

long branch new jersey

  at different times during the war i was in france
about six months all together i was in brest st
nazaire bordeaux paris and marseilles twice i
talked to a great many soldiers and listened atten-
tively to what they had to tell me some of these
soldiers were stupid some were intelligent some
were obvious liars and scoundrels many were just as
obviously honorable and decent most of them were
entirely sober but some were very drunk and others
were on the border line amongst the men i listened
to were yeggs and gunmen factory workers labor-
ers mechanics business and professional men heads
of large companies college graduates and men who
had never seen the inside of a schoolroom

tsjow as i said some of these men were doubtless
careless with the truth but i do not think they
all were if mr c b a is right and the soldiers
food was as good as he says it was then all these
men in all conditions and from all walks of life in
half a dozen french cities and from many outfits

must have entered into a giant conspiracy and re-
hearsed before hand all for the purpose of mislead-
ing me

  then there were the soldiers who used to trail me

around in port scores of them begging me to allow
them to eat aboard ship what about them why
did they tell me they were hungry that the food
given them by their outfits wasnt fit to eat i
dont believe those men were liars they were too
honestly thankful when i gave them places at the
mess-table in the forecastle and they nearly al-
ways left the ship with the same remark-youll
have to come over and eat with us sometime boat-
swain this was merely out of politeness it was
not really an invitation they always added that
is if you arent hungry and dont care much what
you eat you neednt expect to get anything like
you get aboard here and the food aboard that
ship was terrible forecastle food is notoriously
poor but our food was far below the average and
the kind of food id not give to a dog that i thought
anything of-or to any dog in fact it gives me a
weak feeling in my stomach to think of the dishes
handed out to us aboard that ship yet the soldiers
agreed that our food was vastly superior to their
own and came back for more as often as i let them
which was as often as i could i wish i knew the
number of american soldiers who ate aboard the
 roepat while she was in st nazaire and other
ports in france

then there was the firm i knew of that made a
business of buying up condemned foodstuffs
particularly jam and preserves and reboiling it to
be sold to the army buyers they bought thousands
of cans each can with its ends bulged out so that it
looked like a football i know a young fellow who
worked for the company and he told me that the
stench from the cans when opened would knock
a mule down

  but mr cba says these things could not have
happened well perhaps not i thought i saw
them and im confident that most of the men i lis-
tened to thought they were telling the truth but
perhaps the things they and i thought we saw were
visions i notice a peculiar thing in the statistics
of the war though approximately twice as many
died from disease as were killed in action in
round numbers  is the number listed under
the heading disease many causes contributed
of course but remember that the victims were
nearly all young men the pick of the countrys
manhood and had all been physically examined and
pronounced in good health id bet there were
some among them who did not die from an over-
indulgence in good food the food we had aboard
ship was unfit for a dog as i said and if the army
food was worse-i leave the conclusion to you

  mr cba doesnt say whether or not he was in
france during the war is his knowledge first-
hand or is it hearsay it seems to me that he tells
the story himself-   this corps had no chance
to show what it could really do to keep the grub for
the boys good and plentiful how then did it
accomplish so much if it had no chance to accom-
plish anything i dont get that

  well enoughs enough sometime im going
to tell you what i really think of that war but for
the present ill content myself with that ash
query- and we call ourselves civilized-john
webb

 from comrade jay lewis of
norfolk virginia comes a page
out of the literary digest of
 february  with an exclamation
oint over their changing the title of bill
adams book from fenceless meadows
to senseless meadows

crowding conrad

  conrad was no sooner safe upon his pedestal than
men began to burrow about the base already two
rivals s not superiors have been found one here
and one in england our own candidate for con-
rads fame is bill adams an ex-sailor now home
from the sea and settled in california his last
springs book senseless meadows is mentioned
in charles baldwins new critical volume the
men who make r novels as a true rival of
conrads best sea stories and mr baldwin has
samuel hopkins adams no relation to bill to back
himhp in england mr clement shorter hails the
english writer mr h m tomlinson

  fenceless meadows as you know ap-
peared first in our pages and as mr lewis
says in an accompanying letter

  and to think adventure discovered bill adams and
adventure readers have been enjoying his stuff long
before the literary lights spotted him same goes
for sabatini some day theyll discover hugh pen-
dexter

  it is good that bill adams is beginning to
be accorded the place that is his due if a
certain story be true this his first book met
with bad fortune the report is to the
effect that certain of the new york profes-
sional critics were much impressed by the
literary quality of his work but not being
sailors turned for expert judgment on his
knowledge of the sea to one or two ex-fol-
lowers of the sea with literary accomplish-
ments or pretensions of their own that
judgment solemnly delivered was that bill
adams did not know the sea and that his
stories were not sound and reliable from the
point of view of nautical technicalities so
the alarmed critics hastened to hedge on
intended endorsements of fenceless mead-
ows handled it very warily or not at all
and all the sheep critics and sheep readers
who follow along after them of course did
the same

  it is both laughable and pathetic and
rather disgusting i wonder how many of
you who are sailors and know the sea have
written in first and last about bill adams
sea stories if i am wrong correct me but
did any single one of you ever say that bill
adams does not know the sea does any

one of you think he doesnt i know well
enough that a small army of deep water
men who gather at our camp-fire have
stated very emphatically that he does know

the sea

 if i ever knew i have forgotten-and
am glad of it-the names of these nautical
gentlemen - no men - no persons who
safely behind the scenes and established in
the confidence of the confiding critics thus
carefully and coldly prevented another sea-
man from winning literary laurels coveted
by themselves ones sympathy goes to the
critics who were gulled and betrayed by
them but along with the sympathy has to
go a grin that these exceedingly sophistic
cated gentlemen could be so naive as to
trust the verdict of such obviously in-
terested parties as for the parties them-
selves-bah

 heres to bill adams may he come into
his own

south africa being quite

  irintiii some little distance away wil-
ham westrups letter didnt reach
us jn time to appear in the issue
containing his first story in our magazine
but here it is along with his second he did
his best to follow camp-fire custom to
the letter as well as in spirit and camp-fire
doesnt ask anything more than that

  bom in england much longer ago than i care to
think about in the early eighties t be precise
educated there and while still in my teens came to
south africa with the rather nebulous idea of being
secretary on an out-district mine of which the chair-
man was a family friend but when i reached na-
tal the boer war which should have been over
was still in full blast and the alleged mine was quite
inaccessible as soon as i could burst my contract
i did so and joined the natal mounted rifles but
too late for any fighting

hphereafter having a healthy appetite and
no means i did many things checked cargo
at the durban docks tried my hand as a brewery
clerk became accountant for a firm of shipping
agents the last was rather star-spangled as at the
time i knew nothing about accountancy and had to
rely on a pathetic smile and a large amount of bluff
about this time things brisked up and finding my-
self in possession of some real money i wandered
forth to see south africa tried in a not very seri-
ous manner farming gold mining digging for allu-
vial diamonds native trading and sundry other
lines all the time i was storing up material which
later came in very useful for the itch to write is a
family failing adventures none really startling
one rather unique for this sunny country in that
myself and a friend were lost in the snow on the
drakensberg mountains for three days it is not
io

 adventure

often the snow there amounts to anything but on
this occasion it made up for other missed opportu-
nities however we got out none the worse though
rather hungry also had the usual snake adven-
tures none of which ended fatally-for me

ctarted writing about a dozen years ago to
help a friend who owned a rather dud paper i
wrote humorous articles for him and they nearly
killed the paper altogether however a johannes-
burg editor happened to see one in an exchange and
thought highly of it so that was the beginning
have had six novels published in england two of
which did well and the others so-so one has been
filmed the late war drove out any inclination to
write but i began again some two years ago

  for the rest like many struggling authors i do
other work indeed i am no longer a rover but
most domesticated and sedentary getting stout
but though i occupy a niche in a big financial cor-
poration in johannesburg i always cherish the con-
viction that one day a book of mine will boom and
then heighol for the life of the veld with the camp-
fire at night and the good buck stew and the yams
and the mosquitoes and scorpions and snakes still
it is so difficult to remember the snakes and scor-
pions but the smell of the wood fire    -wil-

        a contribution to-our dis-
 tfrr cusson on the early days of to-
bacco from william ashley an-
derson of our writers brigade and
formerly of our editorial staff he holds
that it may have originated in asia instead
of in america

montauk long island new york

  i notice in camp-fire a discussion about the intro-
duction of tobacco to the cossacks both viacon-
stantinople and via archangel may i add to the
discord that i my opinion the tatars may very well
have brought tobacco from the far east

tqbacco has every evidence of having been
indigenous in china and there is just as much
likelihood that tobacco came to america from china
as there is that it went to china from america it
is an ethnological commonplace to note the resem-
blances between characteristics of mongols and
manchus and the indians of america to one who
has seen botk in their natural settings their cousin-
hood is perfectly obvious

  as well as i can remember the native name for
tobacco in manchu is tambaku when i was with
the british-american tobacco company in china
in  the leaf experts exploring the country found
tobacco being grown under conditions that as-
tounded them far in the remote interior the
leaf grew to great size in irrigated fields sometimes
flooded and snow did not seem to make any differ-
ence to the stacks that were piled for curing this
tobacco was extremely coarse and had every indica-
tion of being of native origin i offer this as an
opinion but i have always believed it can be sub-
stantiated that tobacco cultivation had its origin in
china no less than america the flora of both
countries is strikingly similar you know-w a

at a former camp-fire a news-
paper article sent in by a com-
rade told of the death of fred
hans and gave an account of his
life a comrade now riddles the statements
made in that article no comrade blake
i wont refer you to the government rec-
ords etc camp-fire didnt vouch for any
of that article it was merely presented
as everything else is presented at camp-
fire to meet the camp-fire test and if it
deserved it to be pulled to pieces just as
you are doing go to it

brooklyn new york

  a couple of friends old-timers originally from
the cow country were visiting me today and among
others the article in reference to the death and ac-
complishments of one fred hans known as the
lone star came up we all read camp-fire
you can push in all your chips and what personal
calamity you possess that if somebody dont take
notice of said eulogy and reply to what we read-
one of us will i wish cody hickok dr carver
cal joe pawnee bill texas jack bat masterson
and a host more were all alive-together-and i
could be where i could watch them when this epis-
tolory effusion from one of his admirers was read

ttsed both guns hammer fanning ive a hun-
dred bucks says he never made a bulls-eye
without using the trigger unlees by accident and
such dont obtain west

  so far as his being the official war department
investigator of the caster massacre following sit-
ting bulls  miles on horseback and inducing
him to return to the restnation and was present
at sitting bulls death is concerned we two of
us know something regarding it and while person-
ally i dont dispute it all will call to your mind
what really happened you can form your own
opinion

  the custer racket was in  the date was the
th of june and let me say in parenthesis sit-
ting bull wasnt in it gall and crazy hoss ran that
show and what is more had crook followed out
orders instead of retreating-eating his own horses
-afraid to kill game-had cook come up custer
might and probably would have lived to go back
the scrap was in  sitting bull hunted during
the summer and the troops hunted him that was
all round the yellowstone colonel later general
miles was after him and had  soldiers they
overtook bull finally up at cedar creek but not to
pinch him bull did not give up he went to
canada and not until  did he return to fort
buford n d of hunger voluntarily he was at
first pinched and then the government got shut
of him by giving him to cody as an attraction in the
wild west show

  this great f hans may have been in at the death
of bull if so its the first i ever knew of it or of any
white man being there

nce more listen to the facts major mc-
laughlin agent at standing rock sent  in-
jun police up to bulls house they were followed
at a distance by some troops these police were all
the camp-fire



injuns they went up in the dark and in the
racket trying to arrest him in the morning
bulls brother killed one of the police lt bull
head-about a dozen were killed six or so on
each side and after it was all over the brave
troops held back in case of trouble came up
and plugged the camp with hotchkiss guns this
was in 

  will you refer me to thft account in the govern-
ment records where this great hans shows action-
herbert cody blake

  that comrade blake himself fully real-
izes camp-fires methods of bringing out
the real facts by general discussion is evi-
denced from a later letter-in which he has
a shot at too expert gun men

                        brooklyn new york

  by this forum this free-for-all the real true his-
tory of much which has long since happened is for -
the first time being printed in adventure take for
example the controversy hough vs henry

  now when its all thrashed out and weve all put
up our bluff re custer im gambling that out of
what is told in adventure may be read the first and
only complete true account of the affair personally
ive much interest in anything referring to custer
as my mother lost a brother in the scrap

  i hardly think anything i wrote you is worth
printing im an old cow-punch who although
house broke enough to know not to put hoss-radish
on ice-cream cant write good composition enough
for magazines if you think different and consider
what i wrote calculated to start some sport to giv-
ing us some information go ahead

tt may or may not interest you to know i wrote
and have long reply from the best and highest
authorities in united states on gun fanning with a
colt back in those days and absolutely it is only
by accident only by such that absolute centers or
marks are hit at any such distance as we read of
of course none of us old blokes read or pay any at-
tention to these cusses who get their beans by writ-
ing stories of two-gun sports who file the sights off
and pull out the trigger holding up the hammer with
their thumb they might hit a man across a table
or a hoss five feet away and thats all whats more
this chucking a tomato-can or two into the air and
keeping it up there by hitting it six or twelve times
with a colt or throwing up six poker chips and hiv-
ing one after the other and each fell in fragments

usually in about the third chapter is all -

rot as is this getting creased in the skoulder so
often

  to go back to custer-for i am going to let the
gun men fight out the first mentioned wonderful
thing this old sport is said to have done i had sev-
eral talks with two sioux bucks old ones of course
and with a blanket squaw who went through a mis-
sion school last summer the injuns were with
gall who was the top boss in the fight the squaw
did the interpreting for us when necessary and
little by little i am getting the real dope concerning
the massacre and if the outcome of all this contro-
versy over custer results in adventure putting
before th public the whole story i say it will
alone be more than worth all we pay for it-
herbert cody blake

this  letter from our cache
t -iriffirn oult to have been printed long
ago but you know how it is-
	handle all our camp-fire let-

ters with system would demand far more
time than the eleven of us in the office could
possibly get hold of

  probably few of you realize the immense
amount of office work necessary to handle
all the details of our various departments
if adventure printed fiction only we could
probably cut our staff in half and carry the
work easily camp-fire for example is
my own personal job i like camp-fire
as much as any of you but i certainly dont
like the work it involves it looks easy to
fill a few pages mostly with what some one
else writes but i think i never in my life
did anything else that took so much time in
proportion to results shown an iron-clad
fully detailed system would save some of
that time but none of us has time to oper-
ate the system

  so we must just be content with our cache
into which all camp-fire letters go and
from which we draw pretty much at ran-
dom

pardeeville wisconsin

  will some one tell me who wrote in the days of
the meeting it relates to the sepoy uprising

a tiger by bathurst who drives it off with a whip i
read this a long time ago and would like to get it
again-dr a l wood

      reminiscences of east africa
      varied life in portugals leading
      coloay

                                corunna ont
the various sections f the vast continent
of africa under european rule perhaps one
of the many known to us in little more than name
is portuguese east africa in which country the
writer mved for two years at an isolated outpost
n the borders of the districts of zambezi and
mozambique the latter being one of the two re-
gaining provinces or districts that were still under
military jurisdiction at the time of his stay the
other district is that of nyassaland and in these
territories hostile tribes are still to be met with
and their pacification is not always accomplished
without bloodshed

  my entry into the country was at delagoa bay
or as it is better known out there louren  marques

high grade is also successfully grown and manu-
factured in this district

  on arrival opposite the village we dropped anchor
in midstream and it was here that i learned that
at all our ports of calt on the voyage we were unable
to approach the shore any nearer than half a mile
the freight and mails were unloaded in a small
lighter after which we again headed out to sea for
beira a full day and a half were spent here in
this town-known on the coast as tin town on
account of its galvanized-iron buildings-every-
thing is as near up-to-date as possible electric light
and a railway terminal included

  the streets are filled with sand of a very loose
nature and foot travel is anything but pleasant
the merchants however overcome this by going
to and from their places of business in trolley push-
cars they remind one of the hand cars used by
section gangs in our own country with the addition
of a canopy top and seat and of smaller gage
switches are provided so that cars can pass each
other on arrival at their destination they are lifted
off the track and left there whilst the two natives
who represent the motive power seek a shady place
near by until their services are again required each
merchant owns his outfit

  in the past the town had an unenviable reputation
for fever and the mortality ran high for some years
in local circles the old timers will tell you that every
adventure

railroad tie represents a coffin the surrounding
country containing the swamps and flats of the buzi
and the pungwe rivers are anything but a health
sanitarium today beira is so situated that it owes
its development to its geographical position for it
is the natural outlet for the agricultural and mining
products of rhodesia which of itself is sufficient to
force the progress of the port

t eaving beira at high tide we resumed our
voyage for chinde arriving there the next day
this small settlement is on the main mouth of the
zambesi and the ship is unable to approach the
shore nearer than two miles for this distance out
the water is very muddy owing to the vast quantities
of soil and trees that are annually carried down to
the sea forming sandbars making navigation some-
what dangerous for anything but flat-bottomed
boats

  at chinde is the british custom and clearing
house for british central africa or nyassaland
located oh a small tract of land leased from the
portuguese for that purpose a line of flat-bottomed
passenger and freight boats ply on the great river
to chiromo which is the terminal point of the rail-
way connecting with blantyee some one hundred
and twenty miles inland

  our next port was queuimane locally known
as the garden of east africa and located on
another mouth of the zambezi some twenty
miles from the sea the entrance to the river
was effected at just about high tide and a series
of bumps and jolts told of the shallow water on
the bar the river is narrow and winding but
of good depth and on each side are numerous groves
and coconut plantations tangerine oranges grow
to perfection as well as all kinds of tropical fruits
truly it is a veritable garden but a very unhealthful
one the humidity and steaming atmosphere the
deal for tropical growth and vegetation make the
climate very sickly and enervating for the eu-
ropean it was here that the famous missionary
dr livingstone ended his march across africa and
only a few miles farther up the river at a place
called shupanga he buried his wife

  on the ext tide we left for angoche some four
hundred miles north and on the second day out
from queuijnane we came in eight of a rise in the
height of land low-lying hills topped with bush
a decided ehange from the lowlands which we had
been skirting since the commencement of our voy-
age the captain pointed this out to me as the
matadane knowing that was my destination

  in the whole of its eighty miles of coast kne i was
unable to discover a solitary hut or a human being
it nevertheless teemed with life animal insect and
human

  the state of the tide on our arrival at the bar
would not permit our crossing so we lay to for half
an hour after which we were successful touching
bottom nee it was now dark and we were one
and one-half miles from the shore

  in a few minutes a couple of boats came alongside
for mails and passengers one bag of mail two
portuguese officials and myself were mustered for
shore they could not speak english and i could
not speak their language our conversation was
mostly in monosyllables and sign language eight
days of this was plenty for me and i was glad to
leave the ship

  we tumbled into the boats bag and baggage

but were not able to make a landing from them
three hundred yards from shore we got astride a
natives shoulders hanging on to his woolly head
we made the beach here i decided that if i fol-
lowed my baggage i would sure make no mistake
i did this for about a mile eventually arriving
at the house of the only man in the place who could
speak english and he was an italian

  for the next three weeks pending the arrival
from the bush of my senior i was the guest of this
italian gentleman and right nobly did he do the
honors intimately acquainted with native life and
customs for he was the government agent for the
recruiting of native labor for the portuguese pos-
sessions on the west coast i learned much from
him that proved most useful in my subsequent two
years residence among the natives often forty or
eighty miles from another white man for months
at a time

  angoche the portuguese name for the section
of the settlement has a population of thirty whites
at the head of which is an individual styled a
capilou mr the senior oficer of the district and
practically an autocrat as there is no civil law the
districts of mozambique and nyassa are governed
by the military and the powers of the ctpilou msr
are necessarily very wide in all the affairs of the
community his ruling is law subject only to the
government at mozambique

  the post-office is typical of the district-an un-
pretentious building of clay and galvanized-iron
roof the general-delivery letters are put in a cigar
box on the counter you just go in and look them
over and take what belongs to you if you decide
to take half the box or some other fellows well and
good no questions asked delightfully free and
easy the mail arrives only every two weeks

  the society de madal have a warehouse here and
are engaged in the export of mangal-bark ebony
wood ground-nuts and copra

  hoffman a german company have the leading
store for white mans stuff-groceries and canned
vegetables fnrits guns ammunition etc thie
store is the only place where a stranger can get a
lunch and a bed needless to say strangers are few
and far between in this out-of-the-way place conse-
quently no provision is made for them

  besides the above there are several banyan
stores the banyan storekeepers are natives erf
british india they are to be found all along the
coast ad are very successful traders amongst the
natives they probably do the bulk ef the trading
that is done for they readily adapt themselves to
the native way of doing business which is something
a european can not and will not do

  here is the way it is done the native comes into
the store and looks around for some time when
he sees what he wants he seats himself on the ioor
which is the sign that he is ready for business the
storekeeper comes over and seats himself opposite
him a conversation starts up on local gossip in
vraich others nay join after a while the goods are
brought down examined carefully and haggling
commences this goes on for some time neither
being able to agree on price the goods are then
laid aside and a lot more gossip and banter goes on
until they once more get on to the business game
coupled with further haggling this will go on until
a deal is made and more often than not it extends
into a couple of hours the native walks off with
a few yards of cotton and the banyan puts a bag
ask adventure



of ground-nuts into his warehouse each thinking
he has put one over on the other

  the native buys his tobacco-locally made-in
finger widths two three or four fingers are laid
on a roll of tobacco and with a knife in the other
hand the required width is cut off

  parapat the native village adjacent to the portu-
guese settlement of angoche consists of about one
hundred and fifty huts in the day time it is a quiet
and sleepy place but at night many fires are lighted
in the central plaza and dancing goes on most of
the night the monotony of the drums is very try-
ing to a newcomer

tvty three weeks being about ended i was
expecting the arrival of my senior from the
interior at any hour and in due course he arrived
much broken in health and suffering from an attack
of blackwater fever i therefore immediately pre-
pared for my journey and took with me for cook
and general handy man a native who had previously
been in the employ of my senior and whose name was
mokosetti after his height-he was six feet-his
mouth formed the most conspicuous part of his
features and this was in proportion to his height
but as it was his business to take caie of his own
commissary department i had no cause to worry
over his board-bill he understood a few words of
english-sufficient to make him a nuisance swahili
and makua he also spoke fluently and in addition
he also was able to speak some portuguese it was
apparent to me that any spare time i had could be
usefully employed in acquiring a working knowledge
of these languages and with a swahili vocabulary
and a portuguese-english conversation book coupled
with some makua words i evolved a jargon which
soon enabled me to get along fairly well

  at two oclock in the afternoon we embarked on a
dhow the crew consisted of omari the captain
a burly turbaned type of the coast with his crew
of two seamen myself mokosetti and two native
women our cargo comprised ten bags of rice and
a few boxes of merchandise with a favorable wind
we proceeded to the melula river by way of the
main island of angoxa and arrived there at sunset

  the wind dropping we anchored for the night
inside the bar to await the morning tide by mid-
night the tide had receded to such an extent that
our boat was resting on a vast expanse of mud at
least a mile from shore on each side of us were
mangal swamps the night air from which was any-
thing but conducive to sleep especially on bags of
rice

  with the incoming tide at daylight and a freshen-
ing wind in our favor we crossed the bar and were
southward bound at a fairly good clip and by luck
reached our destination a small native village three
miles up the cocola river called tabua just before
sunset this place consisted in the immediate
vicinity of four or five huts one of which belonged
to nahoka the chief of the district the rest of the
clan as i afterward learned were scattered around
the country here i spent two months awaiting the
arrival of machinery from england with which we
were to experiment in the treatment of crude rubber

juring my stay at tabua i had ample oppor-
tunity to get acquainted with my surroundings
and the natives of the district also their various
chiefs

  i had also a suitable site to select for the location

of the plant soundings to take farther up the river

and various other matters to attend to in connection
with the handling erection and transportation of

heavy machinery in a country more or less difficult
of access and without any means of transportation
other than crude native labor

   the site eventually selected for the location of the
plant up on the hills at the village of mpago was
four miles from the head of the cocola river the
latter would be more properly named as an arm of
the sea for it terminated from a width of a mile to
a small narrow creek of shallow water at the head
of which we unloaded all of our machinery and a
twenty h p vertical boiler and this was rolled for
four miles up and down hill and across the swamps
by gangs of men the work was slow and tedious
but after nine months the plant was erected and
ready for steam

   the trial run of the plant was evidently to be the
day of days amongst the natives none of whom had
seen or heard of a steam engine and knew nothing
about it to them it seemed to be a lot of useless
white mans junk and the day that steam was first
raised in the boiler i had an assembly of three hun-
dred men women and children in their faces one
could distinctly see many kinds of emotions-won-
derment expectancy fear exhilaration at eighty
pounds pressure steam was turned on with the
cylinder cocks open

  this was the exhaust and the movement of the
engine was quite sufficient to start the stampede
and away into the bush went everybody shouting
laughing crying and scared to death one woman
i afterward learned went insane and had to be held
down it was quite some time before they came
out but they gradually returned venturing a little
nearer all the time but still in fear

  throughout the day i noticed an individual sit-
ting on the side of a hill some four hundred yards
away by four oclock he had approached to within
a few feet of the machines it took him some hours
to accomplish the distance but he employed his
time in studying out the situation and eventually
decided that it was safe to come alone he turned
out to be kuropa the paramount chief of the
matadane and this was the first opportunity i had
of seeing him on asking through my interpreter
the cause of this stampede i was told that they were
much afraid of the white mans spirit that was in
the boiler-r g waking

  riding through mexico

a country abounding in game-
but be sure you get a gun license be-
fore you cross the border

  request-my partner and myself are expecting
to leave for mexico at an early date we expect to
ride through on horseback and do some hunting
prospectingand find a little adventure it would
help us greatly if you would answer the following
questions

  what is the attitude of the natives toward out-
siders especially the yaqui indians

  is there much mining down there and what kind

  are there any big companies

  is there much hunting in the mountains and what
kind of big game is there

  what kind of rifle and ammunition also pistol
are used mostly down there
i

adventure

  what kind of provisions would you advise taking
if we had a pack-horse

  what business opportunities are there in the
towns

  what clothing would you advise for that climate

  we would appreciate it very much if you would
answer the above questions to the best of your
knowledge-wnxis t lind austin tex

  reply by mr whiteaker-the natives in mexico
are inclined to be friendly with americans as a rule
america is doing much for the mexicans in a busi-
ness way developing the resources of the country
making improvements in their mining agricultural
and manufacturing methods most of the yaqui
indians are a sober industrious people there are
a few that are in a savage state but you are not
likely to find these as they are in a remote region far
from the usual run of men

  mining is one of the chief industries of mexico
the states of sonora and chihuahua rank among
the richest mineral regions in the world minerals
of all kinds are to be found in these states and in ad-
joining states silver copper gold lead zinc coal
and many other minerals are found in the north-
ern states of mexico

  most of the hunting done in mexico is by foreign-
ers as the natives are not much inclined to hunting
except for their food supply ijear deer antelope
mountain goats sheep puma jaguar peccary
tapir beaver armadillo rabbit marten otter and
others the lakes are good places for ducks geese
swans cranes herons storks and other aquatic
birds quail and many other such fowls are abun-
dant a hunting license is now required to hunt in
mexico you can find out about this at the port of
entry

  a  rifle for big game and a shot gun of 
gage for birds are the customary weapons used it
is doubtful if you can enter that country with fire-
arms without a special permit you may be able to
pick up some firearms after you arrive down there
i knew a party of four men in el paso last summer
who were held up for three weeks on account of
wanting to take their guns with them they left
them on this side

  lay in your supplies on the other side so as not
to have to pay duty on your animals and also on a
large amount of eats ride the train to a good
town buy your burros for three or four dollars a
piece get enough grub to last you for a few weeks
find an indian guide for a few cents a day and live
off of the country get acquainted with an ameri-
can who knows the ropes and get him to buy your
stuff for you so that you will not get stung on the
prices

  most of the larger towns in northern mexico are
americanized many opportunities in a business
way can be found if sought

  the days as a whole are like late fall except on
the lowlands where it gets rather warm about mid-
day the nights are chilly and you will need several
blankets especially in the mountainous sections
you will not need much clothing-several pairs of
heavy socks heavy and light underwear good
heavy shoes and leather puttees unless you wear
boots woolen shirts and after you get there you
can see what the others are wearing

pert in charge not to the magazine

the wells fargo colt

few collectors are aware of the dif-
ferences between this type of weapon
and the old model colt pocket pistol

  request-will you please answer the following
questions

  what is a wells-fargo colt

  did col colt manufacture it

  could anybody buy it except the wells-fargo
people

  what was the difference between it and the pocket
pistol colt of that period

  i dont expect you to write a book on arms but
a few words will be welcome-leonard ander-
son newburyport mass

  reply by mr barker-the s-called wells
fargo colt was a  caliber pocket pistol or re-
volver it was an issue of  not many made
five shots with no loading lever it resembled the
old model  pocket pistol with which it is
usually confounded there being these differences

  the old model had a square-backed trigger
guard and elliptical or round cylinder slots or stops
while the proper wells fargo had square cylinder
slots and round-backed trigger guard

  colt revolvers after  including the wells
fargo proper had a small bearing wheel at the
base of the hammer bearing on the main spring
revolvers made in - including the old
model had not the - revolvers had no
little slot in the base of the nose of the hammer with
corresponding points between the cylinder nipples
for the slot to fit over and thus lock the piece be-
tween shots those made after  did have this
feature on some of the old model revolvers
just one point and the slot in the hammer will be
found

  very few people even collectors know of this
variation between the old model and the wells
fargo proper and term them all wells fargo
as a matter of fact the wells fargo co did not
start operating till  as probably less than one
thousand five hundred of the old model were
made they are extremely scarce quite as much so
as a paterson colt which is one made by the first
co in paterson n j they were identical in having
no loading lever this distinction between these
two types of old model and wells fargo is
ignored by bannermans latest catalog and indeed
by all authors so far as i know except sawyer
many persons thinking they have a complete line
of colts have not as they have but one of these two
obviously usually the wells fargo proper

  any one could buy it it was used by the wells
fargo messengers and by police officers being less
apt to catch on being drawn than one with the
regulation loading lever

  lack of loading lever was the noticeable difference
these two were the only two colts save the pater-
son ones that had no loading lever

if theres no wind

un-

  request-would you please give me following in-
formation concerning weather conditions of alaska

  how low does the temperature drop at different
times of year in various parts of alaska

  what is the lowest temperature a person can en-
dure and be able to be about on trap lines etc

  what do people do when caught away from shel-
ter in storms and weather turning colder than they
can stand

  what kind of clothing do people wear to be able
to go about their work in the colder weather-
geo w himes garrett pa

  reply by mr solomons-summer temperatures
in alaska are about spring temperatures elsewhere
though occasionally especially in southern alaska
and in the interior one may experience quite a de-
gree of heat and discomfort winter temperatures
on the south coast are much milder than in the
eastern and north-central united states due to the
comparatively low latitude and the sea in interior
alaska going northward the temperature in win-
ter is naturally lower and lower reaching its coldest
before one next encounters the tempering influence
of water again-arctic ocean water rampart on
the yukon may have say seventy degrees but
taking northern alaska and canada in general the

coldest spells run fifty to sixty below while twenty
to forty below are the average december to febru-
ary temperatures

  temperature itself means little relatively with
respect to the discomfort or danger to human beings
in a dry still air-the almost invariable concomi-
tant conditions of great cold-ordinary wool or fur
clothing if dry protects the body perfectly insu-
lates it and the only vulnerable parts are those
of the face that are pointed or where the bones are
close-end of nose chin cheek bones ears etc
you have to watch them rubbing them a bit now
and again to maintain the circulation people work
out of doors in alaska all winter doing the same
work at fifty and even sixty below

  but wind or damp they are something else
again men dont last long when low temperatures
are added to wind or moisture and a blizzard with a
temperature of zero is far more deadly than 
degrees below in a dry still air when you have
forty below and a blizzard which is not very com-
mon-look out

  when the blizzard begins you beat it for home
if you havent any home near you make camp-
shelter behind a rock in timber bank of a stream-
anything and get into your sleeping bag no sleep-
ing bag well its like this in a northern country
subject to storms a man should never be far away
from his cabin or shack or tent without having his
sleeping bag with him thats the answer

  however if he just simply hasnt it with him his
one best bet is shelter a cave will give it or a very
protected niche of rocks but even then he will have
to keep moving or exercising his limbs if the blow
continues long and eating regularly if shelter
is not at hand he must make himself a snow shelter
by kicking up a big heap of it crawling into it tun-
neling and then try to press up so as to give himself
a little room-fashioning thus a kind of chamber
just a bit larger than his body preferably the floor
of it should be the original earth which may have
tundra moss or dry grass for surface otherwise
the warmth of his body will melt the snow beneath
him and he might get somewhat wet that would
hurt a lot when he came to beat it away on the
storm subsiding if dry in such a shelter he will
be as safe and almost as comfortable as in a bag
if there is no snow for shelter and no other shelter
he will die if the wind continues long enough cloth-
ing in winter is just dry woolens with a fur parka
instead of overcoat of course the feet and hands
have to be well protected-they are the really vul-
nerable parts

  reply by mr norman-i am now in a position to
reply seriatim to your queries first meet mr nel-
son mp for the northern territory who has the
rare distinction of possessing the status and all the
emoluments of a member of the federal legislature
and endowed with the right to talk but is prevented
by an anachronistic enactment from recording a
note on any subject relating to his constituency

  i submitted your queries to mr nelson the re-
plies are mainly his 

  	what tin mines are there in the vicinity of
port darwin

  answer-all kinds of minerals occur in the ter-
ritory the only reason for their not being exploited
is lack of transportation facilities the biggest tin
field in australia lies about fifty miles from the pres-
ent railway from port darwin to katharine river
the marranboy field values range from four to
five per cent the tin-bearing area covers hundreds
of square miles railway will be in course of con-
struction withirreighteen months which will run
within ten miles of marranboy and should be com-
pleted in two years the mining area of the terri-
tory covers the whole of the north and central por-
tions of the area and comprehends approximately
 square miles of territory much of which has
never been exploited many huge base-metal lodes
are known to exist but are not worked owing to
their isolation	

  	re wages etc mr nelson writes on this
point-

  as much as i desire to see the territory popu-
lated i would not advise any wage-earner to go
there the type of men required in the n t is the
self-reliant prospector or settler hundreds of un-
employed embracing every known trade are and
have been out of work for over twelve months

scribes it as a tonic climate the native-born

nent produces

   for pastoral purposes-horse cattle sheep or pig-
raising-the territory has no equal in australia
the ckief drawback to settlement is lack of cheap
transportation with the advent of the n t rail-
way this difficulty will be considerably overcome

  so sir dont on any account migrate to the

yith many of mr nelsons glowing statements i
am in complete discord the n t has been
prospected and exploited for thirty years and has
never produced any wonderful results it was said
of kalgoorlie-as mr nelson says of the n t-
that the mineral-bearing area covered thousands of
square miles to-day kalgoorlie is practically
worked out and the richly-impregnated composite

ore-bodies occurred within a longtudinal length of

less than one statute mile

  otherwise the n t offers incomparable facul-
ties for pastoral promotion and although the fed-
eral government proposes squandering many mil-
lions of pounds on an unnecessary railway hundreds
of miles long mainly for the transport of cheap and
nasty politicians its construction will no more
stimulate the progress of the distressful area
than a fly-blister will remove a carbuncle from a
wooden leg

ver in florida is unlawful

  hunting regular game at night i think is barred
by law write the florida state game warden
at tallahassee for pamphlet copy of game laws
your non-resident hunting license will come high
by the way-about  per county per hunter
i think

  fishing-tackle if you cast use a short rod
twenty-four pound test black silk line level-winding
reel and for baits light-colored-running to red
white and yellow-wooden minnows the best
minnow i know is pfluegers surprize with hed-
dons zaragossa and head-on basser and
south bends bass-oreno next in line of course
you can use live minnows if you can get them in
place of the artificial ones this you understand
is for bass the only fish you are likely to find in the
glades country flies are not well-liked here

  hunting alligators theyre pretty scarce now
usually hunted at night by shining their eyes
with a light shot and the spot marked next day
one can go back with a long hook on a long pole and
find them-if he has really killed them there is
little in it commercially so far as i know there
is no law against killing gators

  i believe this answers your questions im wish-
ing you good luck
