    few writers have ever

  itul the flaming pen of
  tilovannl howardo kney no

  fearless to ihe ultimate de-

  caccio exposed human life
  and love in the raw re-
  sorted to every possible
  means to keep this master-
  piece from general circula-
  tion at one time they
  actually went so far as to
  gather all the available
  copies and have them pub-

                   day to-day the thrill

two devils for
devlin

   by robert leslie bellem

a womans breasts were no
novelty to al devlin but
these were different al had
a copra plantation with a side-line
of pearl shells on the tiny south sea
inland of tongalusa and the light-
liued native girls who wore a string
of pearls and an amiable expression

loa-loa could wiggle in a g-string
like nobodys business

had become an old story

  maybe im dead al said tear-
ing his eyes away from the smooth
white breasts and permitting hi gaz
to travel upward

  the girl who was leaning over him
smiled she didnt seem to realize
how low her dress was cuc in tin
neck she was dressed in crisp white
she had reddish-gold hair her eyes
had an amber tint her nose was just
the tiniest bit tip-tilted and her
mouth was red and smiling here
and there a stray freckle intruded it-
self

  no youre not in heaven
youre in the hospital at port wytka
and youre not to talk the red-
haired divinity said

  port wytka al said wonder-
ingly why port wytka was
seventy sea-miles from tongalusa
the better part of a days journey in
a launch what about my planta-
tion he protested

  sh-h concussion cases are sup-
posed to be kept quiet

  ai pondered then he grinned a
little when did iiarl carroll bring

his chorus down here to act as
nurses

the girl in white blushed no
matter how ill you must live up to
your reputation mustnt you-

 have i a reputation al said in
 surprise

all over the islands youre a
lady-killer but you cant work
your charm on me im strictly
business and youre just another
case

how long have i been here and
how did i get here he persisted

youve been here a week dead
to the world and a fat native chief
brought vou

old illybo

she nodded i think thats who
it was

al smiled i thought the old
blighter had run off i misjudged
him w ow what a scrap that was
the last thing i remember was being
bashed on the head and jumping
into the lagoon

  its a wonder you werent killed
you have a hard head

  and a soft heart in fact every
time i look at you my heart gets
softer

  youre still delirious now go
to sleep

  tij only dream about you if i
do

  well see that your dreams are
moral and she left him

  in the week of al devlins con-
valescence that followed he came to
the conclusion that the hundred or
more previous times he had been in

 love were but passing phases of de-
 mentia there was no one like aik
 denny the red-haired nurse

 thats great he had said when
 he learned her name

 whats great

 your being alice denny
 why

because you wont have to
change your initials when you marry
me alice denny a d and im
al devlin also a d

 who said anything about marry-
 ing you

 oh lots of girls but  turned
 em all down i was waiting for you
 to come along

 you take a lot for granted she
 flung this parting shot and left him
 but he was persistent- the next

                             turn


time she came in he said listen
youve got to marry me

 why

  well you know everything
about me there is to be known
youve bathed me and changed my
clothes and all that sort of thing
youve got to marry me to save my
self-respect youve compromised
me

  she laughed if i married every
man ive takon care of id be a poly-
andrist a hundred times over
thats a good word what docs
it mean he teased

  she smiled gaily listen do you
think id marry a man with your
reputation why youd two-time
me the first chance you got no
im a one-man woman for a one-
woman man

  he blushed oh i know ive
got a name for that sort of thing
but im a changed man now wont
you give me a chance to prove it to
you

ginger stories

  well she hesitated t tell
you what if after you leave to-
morrow you can prove that youd
be faithful for-a couple of months

i might listen to you

  thats easy just watch me

   thats the trouble- cant watch
you but i tell you what i can do
ill let you take my house-boy
chong back to tongalusa with you
he can report to me about you
would you be willing to do that
which was how al devlin came
to go back to tongalusa with a chin-
ese house-boy and a heart full of
resolutions

  the first thing devlin did when
he got back to his island was to clean
out his household staff which con-
sisted of three native girls one in
particular little loa-loa objected
strenuously

  chinaman cant take -place of
loa-loa she complained

  oh yes he can hes a good
cook and he knows how to do house-
work

dont you want your dawn-blos-
som  the girl cried as she leaned
over him

  loa-loa w i g-
g  e d sinuously
in view of the
fact that her sole
garment was a
g-s t r i n g the
wiggle was very
effective she
was a rich gold
color and her
form would have
passed muster in
any z i e g f e  d
show china-
man cant do
this she said
seductively

  hed better
not or ill throw
him out on his
  loa-loa came closer can china-
man kiss like loa-loa she whis-
pered

  i dont know why dont you
try him and sec

  the girl frowned and backed
away loa-loa no kiss chinaman
loa-loa only kiss tuan dev-lin

  not any more you dont im a
good boy from now on im sorry
loa but thats all over good-bye
and good luck and heres a box of
stogies for you as a parting gift

  i hope you noticed that- devlin
sad to chong

  me see me roll missie denny
chong answered

  that same night old illybo the
chief dropped in for a visit al was
glad to see him so you managed
to beat rarapu off after all he said
as he offered the native a swie of
gin

  you save hlybos life illybo no
forget lilvbo repay wait and
see

  but illybo has repaid already
al protested

  no lilvbo repay wait and
see the old man repeated myster-
iously as he left

  al devlin went to bed early he
was tired after the first day back at
work he went to sleep immed -
ately but soon awoke with the feel-
ing he was not alone

  al stared two native girls as
pretty a pair as hed ever seen in the
islands young fresh and absolutely
pajamnless were in his bed one on
each side of him

  me tolu me toa-lea they
said softly

  what in the devil are you doing
here both of you

   we present to you from illybo
you like us some maybe

  i dont vant you to belong to
me i have other plans devlin
said angrily

  maybe you like just one of us
tonight eh you like me stay and
bvr go tolus face was close o
him she pointed at toa-lea

  no me stay she go toa-lea

  eddie stalked through the lobby
that night until he found precisely
what he wanted she was blonde
by decision and looked quite as
though anything that came out in
the papers about her wouldnt do her

reputation any harm she looked in
a word as though she didnt hava
any reputation at all worth bother-
ing about

  she was seated on a settee in an al-
cove reading a pink-covered tabloid
and smoking as eddie sank down
at the other end of the divan she
put her cigarette on the rim of the
ash tray between them when she
reached for it again it had burned
away to little more than a cylindri-
cal ash she withdrew her hand dis-
gustedly

  have one of mine eddie offered
courteously and extended the pack
she smiled and accepted one lyobe
had given eddie a lighter for his
birthday it worked for the blonde-
by-decision

  	 n o w 
whatll we talk
about eddie
grinned

  you begin
she suggested

  after a while
she threw away
the tabloid and
they got confi-
d e n t i a  as
lyobe remarked
in the morning
eddie had
plenty of the
old s a and
very little
s-a-p when
they got up to
take the eleva-
tor the blonde
carefully looked
all about

  you didnt see the house dick

die

  no but then i wouldnt know
him if i saw him come on it f

all right	come erel eddie exclaimed

i hate house dicks said she as	dragging her back she struggled

the elevator took them up	with him but he hung on all this
i dont take many of them to my t stalling for nothing wothahell

little round bosom either replied	the rapping became more insis-
eddie

her name
proved to be wanna smoke he asked the girl

edith and she
was wearing a
dress with a
plaited skirt so it
didnt take her
long to get that
off she said she
wanted to pre-
serve the plaits

  eddie had a
bottle of what-
all-the shootins-
fer and gave her
a drink

  where d i d
you get this lic-
ker she wanted
to know

  what do you want baby a pedi-
gree you aint buyln a dog
look ill drink with you to show
you its safe

  they finished the drinks and ed-
die looked at his watch nine-
thirty and lyobe and her raiding
party werent due before eleven
well no use wasting an hour and a
half

  they settled down to finish the
bottle and eddie started to neck the
young lady just to keep himself in-
terested shortly before eleven
oclock there was a rap on the door

  dont move said eddie

  edith had sat up at the first sound
and now jumped to her feet im
going she said starting to duck out
to the fire-escape without a dress
and with her unhooked brassiere hap-
ping around her jike water wings

tent and demanding

  now keep quiet eddie said
and thrust his unwilling guest into
a chair she sat there tense and
white-faced a moment then ab-
ruptly relaxed oh tahell with
them she said give me a ciga-
rette before you open the door

  eddie tossed her the pack from
the table beside the bed following
it with a folder of matches the
door panel seemed ready to split from
the pounding it was getting

  eddie turned the knob and yanked
the door open pushing back his hair
sheepishly

  into the room blew the runty
house dick with his soft hat on the
back of his bullet head just be-
hind him was lyobe wearing a man-
tle of righteous wrath

  they looked about both showing
a shocked expression then the de-

turn over
tective gave a yell like a man struck
from ambush with a leap he was
on top of eddie and pounding him
about the head edith screamed
lyobe looked at them as though they
were all crazy then seeing eddie
getting the worst of it and taking
rights and lefts with just about every
part of him but the arms he had
raised in defense she grabbed the
telephone and banged it down with
all her might on top of the clicks
head he hit the floor like a sack of
wet meal lyobe reached down put

the telephone back on its stand and
hung up the receiver

  whats the idea she demanded
gf the stunned detective i told
you to come here to mr morris
room with me and see what there
was to see i didnt tell you to as-
sault him

  but you dont get the idea said
the detective jumping up and stag-
gering eddie with more rights

yuh more of an idea of the swell

else at would yuh expect anybody to
come home from looking like they
had just recovered from the bubonic
plague or been run over by a couple
of cheer leaders

  when mickey marshall gives me
the come hither to promenade myself
up to the beer and pretzel institution
where he was in for four years i
wasnt exactly thrilled to a hot to-

ginger stories

    yuli see dearie id made a new
  years resolution to lead the pure and
  imple for a change and im not one
  of them low downs what make and
  break their resolutions the same week

    so i thought id ward off my des-
 tiny by running double for awhile
 anyway long enough to grease the
 skids of life with a little alimony
 whats that yuh say yuh think a
 prom would be a good place to pick
 up the necessary article wearing pants
 that show listen to me dearie col-
 lege men make the grandest vsugar
 papas but for an honest-to-gawd-
 bring-home-the-bacon-daddy oh i
 could laugh myself into a state of
 semicolon

     a prom dearie is a hifalutin title
 for a plumbers ball theyve got
 the same trimmings otherwise wine
 women and song arc the same old
 tools of the devil since eve invented
 ferment and torment by the simple
 act of sinking her upper set in a
 choice ben davis whether you spell
 em that wray or call em gin broads
 and whoopee

  thats why i turned mickeys sin-
 ful invitation down flatter than a nail
 hammered in by a woman i knew
 only too well that proms were not
 conducted along the lines of a wed-
 nesday night prayer meeting but
 he kept urging me for old times sake
 me and mickey discovered our first
 red kiss together so after saying no
 absolutely positively five or six times
 i gave in as us weak sisters always do
 to cave man tactic and anyways

 i figured it wouldnt interfere with
 my leading the pure life since mick-
 eys reformed just like me and is
 studying to be a minister though
 i might have knew dearie that d d
 can stand for dirty devil as well as
 other things

   but let me spill in your earf dearie

the awful truth about this prom-
itll paralyze you though it was
conducted under the divine influence
of christianity so to speak it was
a wow their high tide was a cos-
tume ball your gentleman friend
concocting said costume out of the
billboards of his imagination

  yuhd be surprised at the single-
track minds them ministerial students
had they could have been put in
jail for infringing on the copyright
of eves original little sin and
gawd knows what mickey was suf-
fering from when he drew up the
specifications for me water on the
knee maybe or else hed been read-
ing that doggerel of bill shakes-
peares for my costume was nothing
much before and liarf of that be-
hind if yuh can wrap the shreds of
your mentality around that dearie

  of course i was flattered any wo-
man would be to have a man think
yuh wear a brassiere size number 
with a couple of tucks when i really
have to wear a forty-fo- never
mind thats nobodys business not
even yours

  when that costume was delivered
to my hang-out at the deaconess
home i gave mickey a ring to find
out where and why the eighth letter
of the alphabet they had only sent
me a couple of patch pockets of chif-
fon

  tatch pockets yells mickey
getting temperamental

  thats your costume youre
supposed to be a water-nymph

  so i says sarcastic like  thank
gawd for the water 

  but it didnt penetrate my re-
mark i mean now wouldnc that
have socked yuh more bow-legged
than yuh are already

  needless to say it didnt overwork
me to get dressed just as i w-as
why turn the spotlight on nte she whimpered as they dragged her out

fm all lit up already

stretching a point on tlie chiffon
mickey calls me up

  be sure to wear the flowers i sent
you yvonne he articulates airily
theyre die crowning touch to that
costume i designed

  well if i had vuh here id put a
crowning touch on yuh that yuhd
be an unknown soldier even to your
own family i sneezes back im
getting a cold in my head already
due to your lack of chivalry cash
and cloth what in gawds name

will i pin them water lilies to any-
way

  use your ingenuity old hoss
says sir walter raleigh the second
as he hung up on me

  but i didnt have any with me
dearie and the heaven what is sup-
posed to protect us poor working goils
had closed at noon that day so after
much exercising of the old bean i
gets a piece of ribbon tics it around
my meridian stick that bunch of
pond posies inside it and wears rem

turn ocer
how u as the prom
dearie she asked

as a boutonniere dont look that
up dearie youll never get over it

  the hour for the prom finally rolls
around just as im getting ready to
catch double pneumonia and  get
another jolt dearie there was two
proms both going on at one and the
same time and in the same place if
yuh can deduce the einstein of that
dearie

  yuh see this was one of them trial
marriage colleges men and girls
both and the idear was to see if
yuh could stand each other at the

same table seven mornings a week
restraint from throwing the coffee
cups ar each others head was con-
sidered the same as a publicly an-
nounced engagement

  then came the war of the sexes
the males suddenly went big head
turned up their olfactory organs at
the domestic brands and went in for
classy importations like me dearie
of course that made the local dames
madder than wet cats so they sot
the hot idear of staging a pram of
their own on the same date and in-


 hxpell darlm im
 still limpin and
 vve got a collegi-
 ate collection of
 bruises in harvard
 red yale blue
 attd princeton
 orange and
 black

viting that tricky species the man
back home there was only the one
place to hold both armies so it soon
got to be quite a mixed tea party if
yuh can sip the oolong of that
dearie

  the collegc ribs had outguessed the
boys in providing that which agitates
the dogs by having a twcnty-piece
orchestra composed entirely of moan-
ing saxaphones as against the mere
fifteen blue shakers signed up by
mickeys gang and when they both
played at the sime time without the

technicality of having the same tune
well bring on your hell and damna-
tion and lets sec what they got whatl
worse

  the two camps was as chummy a
a pimento cheesc sandwich and a
strawberry shortcake in the middle of
the night without a soda mint in the
house the girls were out to avenge
their insults and their insulators were
as well prepared as thrv might have
been if they had taken their scorncd
women more seriously

  mickey had got another of them

shockingly bright idears of his and
had had the swimming pool drained
decorated up to the nines with the
orchestra hidden behind a clump of
bullrushes along the side dim lights

nd the rest of the stage settings of a
inful suite

  the effect was a stunner and more
than crabbed the rival attraction
dancing space unless they used the
mens lockers and of course no sclf-
respecting female would go in such
a place without a special invitation
and anyways mickey and his fel-
low reverends were holding those
locker rooms in reserve under a pad-

 lock as a peach of a place for a pie-

    for after all dearie prom with-

somewhere n the village hampton
was grateful


ginger storifs



  strolling toward the outskirts of
town he came upon exactly what he
wanted a near little cottage sitting
back from the road a bxr and look-
ing very homelike and hospitable
his rap at the door was answered by
a good-looking middle-aged madame
to whom he explained the circum-
stances of his plight and of whom
he begged the favor of shelter for
the night

  certainement monsieur she re-
plied ushering him into a plain lit-
tle living room you have walked
a long way and you are tired it
is only right that you have rest and
sleep

  but where is the monsieur
asked hampton gazing curiously
about the room

  the madame explained that her
husband had gone on a journey from
which he had yet to return

  but what does it matter she
asked naively monsieur the eng-
lishman is most
welcome never-
theless

  she c o n-
ductcd him to
the room he was
to occupy and
explained that
inasmuch as it
led from the
room in which
she herself slept
it might be well
were he to retire
first

  and in the
morning she
said do not
rise until six
please for
then i too
shall have risen
and you may

pass through my chamber without
fear of embarrassment

  hampton thanked her profusely
and retired being weary from his
long walk he slept soundly and
awoke in the morning feeling much
refreshed he wondered while
dressing if the monsieur had re-
turned home during the night but
assumed that he had then glanc-
ing at his wrist watch he saw that
the time was many minutes past six
doubtless monsieur and madame
were up and waiting breakfast for
him he opened the door of his
room and stepped boldly into the
adjoining chamber

  mon dieu surely there was
some mistake there was no mon-
sieur to be seen but the madame was
very much in evidence she had not
yet risen much less left the room
in fact she was reclining upon the
bed in voluptuous abandon appar-
ently sound asleep as the night

turn ocerj
had been warm she bad neglected to
wear the usual sleeping garment and
allowed the single coverlet to slip to
the floor

  hampton gasped as he glimpsed
her unconcealed charms so tempt-
ingly disclosed and would have
stumbled back through the doorwray
had she not opened her eyes at that
moment and seen him regarding her

  what monsieur she exclaimed
starting up with flushed cheeks and
bright eyes

  a thousand pardons he stam-
mered as it is past six i assumed
that madame would be in the living
room else i should not have entered
here

  ah she said softly it is the
big mistake j forgot to inform
monsieur that i have the habit of
oversleeping but what does it mat-
ter monsieur

  er-it is nothing i suppose
stammered hampton unless per-
haps my untimely intrusion has been
embarrassing for madame

  her smile broadened her bright
eyes grew warm and glowing
slowly rising to a sitting posture she
slid long bare legs over the edge of
the bed and st for a moment sau-
cily regarding him then she rose
and moved forward

  it is nothing she murmured in
low tones for last night i
dreamed ot the good-looking mon-
sieur and there were no doors be-
tween us 

  hampton coughed and dropped
his gaze but the monsieur ma-
dames husband did he not return
in the night

no my friend she answered
several months ago he went on a
journey and i did not expect him to

mad bad
baby

by eldon lynch

the story so far

  julie rose a little dancer known
as broadway baby bitterly resents
it when dad kinney her platonic
sugar daddy pays attention to an-
other woman to make him jealous
she asks philip hliot a prominent ar-
tist to make love to her before dad
he does so but dad seems not to
care so julie desperately suggests that
philip and she marry after a hasty
marriage she telephones dad but in-
stead of being en-
raged or jealous he
congratulates her

julie is heartbrok-
en and dazedly
consents to accom-
pany her unwant-
ed husband on a
business trip to
boston by boat

  by accident she
finds three paint-
ings of a nude wo-
man in philips
suitcase and
shortly afterward
sees him walking
the deck with the
woman who posed
for the pictures

she believes he planned to meet her
on the boat

  after julie has gone to bed she is
awakened by a searchlight shining in
her face a strange man muttering
something about the sketches it
entranced by her beauty and makes
love to her seemingly hynotized by
his caresses she makes no resistance
and is horrified to find herself re-
sponding   

he surpt
at hungrily
to him kissing
her rapturously

turn over


  suddenly the lights were
switched on and the next mo-
ment the man beside her was
wrenched violently away still lethar-
gic from the unknown intruders sens-
uous love-making julie glanced up
and saw philip white with anger deal
a blow that sent the white-haired man
reeling there was no fight not even
a quarrel the intruder skulked sil-
ently away nursing his cheek and
philip locked the
door behind him

  so hes got
you too has he
he asked of the be-

 w i  d e r e d girl

 thenas she only-
 stared puzzled he
 laughed harshly

or is he another
platonic friend
like dad

  why i never
saw this man be-
fore she exclaim-
ed outraged i
was asleep to-night
when he came in

i heard him say
something about

some sketches he 

never even knew i
was here until i sort of screamed a
little then he seemed to forget
what hed come for he-well he
kissed me and i dont know  just
felt too weak to call out 
dont you know that that is old
fascination who boasts of being able
to get any woman he wants

   disgust seized her at this startling
 information she had heard plenty
 about the man whom the show girls
 all called  old fascination many
 times she had listened scornfully to
 their vivid stories of the old nuns
 amorous conquests of his strange and

 fashions in love

unfailing power now she shud-
dered filled with horror at her own
weakness she should have killed the
loathesome creature he was un-
doubtedly taking advantage of a
foolish superstition that some silly
woman had started strange power
indeed she almost wished for an-
other chance in which to prove what
little power he had over her at least
there was no doubt that the man
knew how to love
how to please a
womans senses
he could she
thought make
surrender a very
pleasant thing but
to make it an in-
evitable and cer-
tain thing - that
she did not believe
it amused her to
learn that philip
believed in it

  his wife is on
board too he
went on morosely
shes very beauti-
ful and hes terrib-
ly jealous of her
julie began to
understand that
tawny-haired woman then was old
fascinations wife and he was jenlous
of her he had entered the state-
room to-night in search of those
sketches of her and after he got
them then what would he be sat-
isfied to destroy them or would
that one wickedly inviting painting
make him want to avenge himself on
the man who had painted it julie
was uneasy not that it mattered
what happened to philip but murder
is a very mussy business whoever the
victim is

  well run back to your deck

       could kiss you half to death
 fondle you and find you fair
 as we mingle breath with breath

 dimpled shoulders sigh for love
 through your frail brassiere i see
 twin delights you cannot hide
 fashioned just lor ecstasy

 dont put on that evening gown

  you dont look as though you
needed much he remarked unable
to take his eyes from the delectable
picture she presented and im not
going to run along youre my wife
and as long as there arc men like that

she too closed her eyes

  the guttural eerie sound of a fog
horn awakened her she couldnt
have slept long because it was still
dark outside but in the slrort time
she had slept a storm had blown up
she could hear the patter and swish
of rain on the deck outride and the
boat itself pitched and tossed fright-

tnger sent tfc
other man reeling

old fool i intend to stay here and

  their eyes met locked hers defi-

last she turned awav pulled the cov-

a grudging gnight after a brief
silence she heard little sounds that in-
dicated he was undressing a few
moments afterward he climbej up
into the top berth he remained
quiet and motionless for so long that
she surmised he had gone to sleep

eningly the movement increased
until she began to wonder i there
was any danger

  well might as well read she knew
he couldnt sleep while the boat tip-
ped like that she pujied on the bed-
light leaned out over the edge of the
bed to rcach for a magazine the
boat suddenly tilting dipped so low
that she lost her balance and wa
thrown on the floor before he
could rie a leg swung out from the
top berth and philip jumped down

until 
tonight 
he said
in

parting

  he cradled her slight form in his
arms his eyes fixed anxiously upon
her not hurt are you dear he
questioned

  no put me down please 

  he reluctantly placed her in the
berth then sighed loudly lord i
dont know which are most becom-
ing to you rompers or pajamas he
aid smiling down at her

  she continued to stare at him ston-
ily and after a moment he leaned
over buried his head in the lace at
her breast julie he whispered un-
steadily his hands on her shoulders
julie why are you so mean to me
dont you like me at all

  no i dont you have no strange
power over women she replied
mockingly

  but you have over men he
cried his lips burning through the
slk of her blouse julie julie i
want you awfully his eyes beg-
ged implored her

  how much longer must i endure

this she inquired acidly how
dared he act like that the memory
of those paintings in his suitcase
seared her with all their hateful im-
lications if you persist in he-
aving so abominably ill take a deck
chair

 wrong you are going to stay
right here with me where you belong
i married you because of a foolish
whim that you had but that wsis be-
fore i knew how desire could torture
a man id do anything for you you
know i would why cant you help
me let me hold you kiss you at
least then as she remained cold
and silent he gripped her shoulders
hard his breath came jerkily the
veins in his forehead showed blue
trembling he bit his lips in a strug-
gle for control

 angered at his clutch upon her
shoulders she twisted sharply about
her movement loosened the slender
ribbon straps of her pajama blouse
hastily she endeavored to replace the
severed garment but he held her arms
down his eyes frankly feasting upon
the beauty thus uncovered with an
incoherent pagan cry he swept her
hungrily to his breast bending her
head far back with the fierceness of
his kisses when the torment within
him had been somewhat appeased he
allowed her to sink back exhausted
on the pillow

   dont be too angry mv dear-
est he whispered and with a linger-
ing glance at her he reluctantly
climbed up into the top berth

  for a long long time she lay mo-
tionless in the dark living over and
over again those mad passionate mo-
ments when philips lips had claimcd
and possessed hers useless to deny
that his touch had thrilled her as she
had never known a woman could be

no second-hand love for her thank
you she regretted having allowed
him a single kiss

  sleep was impossible after that for
her though the deep measured
breathing of her husband assured her
that he at least had fallen asleep
she lay and watched dawn creep
through the shuttered window

  stealthy footsteps in the corridor
caused her to sit up alert and listen-
ing in the dimness she saw a white
square slide under the door a let-
ter apparently she waited while
the soft footfalls died away then
noiselessly she rose stole across the
room and took the envelope it was
not sealed and regardless of the name
 philip eliot scrawled across the
message she opened it praying that
he would not awake there was just

i

thrilled useless too to deny that
she longed with every throbbing
nerve of her to call him back to give
him the love he had wanted so badly
then recalling those paintings the
brazen-haired woman with her kiss-
provoking mouth julie froze again

one line hastily written in a decided-
ly feminine hand

destroy thf picture at once or
my but bund hill kill us

in less than an hour the ship
would dock at boston and without
a doubt old fascination would

 she glared as she read the letter
 written in a feminine hand

turn ocer


search for the paintings as soon as
they landed there was no time to
waste she hated her husband so
she told herself very vehemently sev-
eral times but she couldnt stand by
and see him murdered in cold blood

ginger stories

  he chuckled but did not turn so
very quickly she re-arranged the
contents of his suitcase and softly
closed it then she dressed

  wc dock soon better hurry she
said briefly and went out on deck

        i find hes painted a picture of you iii kill hint her
       husband yelled

tearing the letter in tiny bits she
tucked the pieces away in a pocket
of her suitcase and then keeping
one eye upon the sleeping man in
the top berth she opened his suitcase
and extracted the rolled drawings
hastily she unwrapped them placed
them in her own suitcase and then
wrapped the paper around a maga-
zine so that if philip looked he
would think the paintings were still
there

  not up already julie philips
voice drawled sleepily

   yes-im im dressing dont
look  she managed to mumble de-
spite the fright caused by his ques-
tion

there was no sign of old fascina-
tion or his beautiful wife and she
was rather relieved she sat alone
on a small folding chair her troub-
led eyes fixed unseeingly on the wa-
ter below when they began to near
the dock she rose and went back to
the stateroom

  philip was just leaving carrying
both suitcases but she insisted upon
having her own and surprised and
not a little displeased he finally sur-
rendered it

  there was a large crowd below
waiting for the gang plank to be
lowered bur nowhere coujd she see
the two people she hated filing up
the plank sometime later however

not a wrestler but he had

	spent a goodly portion of his
twenty-nine years in either falling or
being thrown over he had been
falling for girls for fifteen years
and fourteen years had been
spent in being thrown over by the
girls he fell for now the composer

of three successful musical comedies
in collaboration with his friend kel-
sey hammond he found himself
once more left in the lurch

  peggy black was the offender this
time peggy black the diminutive
and peppy star of the first two smell-

a lovely ghl was
just getting out of
fhe tub when in
he stumbled a very
much scared knight
of the bath

gaged to peggy for three consecutive
months but at the last moment she
had packed up and eloped with an
argentine beef baron and gone off
to live in a south american castle
leaving her fiance and his new show
in an embarrassing predicament

  ot its terrible j torrington
groaned when kelsey hammond
with whom he shared a luxurious
park avenue apartment broke the
news

  kelsey grinned  you got all the
best of it my lad he stated with
conviction youre lucky and dont
know it

but kelsey i loved the girl
a mans a fool to fall for some
nitwit dame and let her get him all
google-eyed me i hate the sight of
the creatures

  but you dont know what real

love is kelsey

  smell sat down at the ornate grand
piano and strummed the keys reflec-
tiv y producing soft and melan-
c y chords its beyond me how
 ju a woman-hater can write such
v-ul-stirring love lyrics he said

  kelsey grinned oh its easy i
just close my eyes and say to myself
well what would you write if you
were damned fool enough to be in
love then whatever i write well
there i am

  smeli sighed mournfully rweli i
guess peggy is well on her way to
south america by this time

  hammond started yes weve
gotta dig up a new soprano for the
rehearsal here lets see somebody
was telling me about a young dame
with a good voice and not much ex-
perience she might take the job

turn over

during rehearsals until katz and
kohn sign up some other star for us
cant hold up the rest of the cast just
because one dame decides to take a
run-out powder oh heres the ad-
dress over on sixth avenue take
a run up that way wront you and
look this chicken up

  smell took the slip of paper

  it was a shabby-looking brick
dwelling which bore the number cor-
responding to that on the slip whch
j torrington smell consulted he
mounted the worn stone steps and
pulled an old-fashioned bell-handle

  a slatternly woman opened the
door j torrington doffed his hat
glanced at his memorandum again
and clearin his voice politely in-
quired is this where miss donna
hissup lives

  the woman regarded him with ap-
parent suspicion what do you
want

  i heard she was looking for an en-
gagement and-

  his grim-visaged interlocutress re-
lented a little oh she said open-
ing the door a little wider a job
for her eh well you can come in
its time she was landin somethin
she owes two weeks board bill go
right upstairs shes on the third
floor back go right up

  as he mounted the first flight of
stairs he heard a voice pure and mel-
odious emanating from the regions
above when he reached the room
from which the singing came en-
tranced by the voice he forgot the
formality of knocking grasping the
door-knob impatienrly he turned it
and shoved j torrington stum-
bled awkwardly into the room and
was met by a horrified shriek of dis-
may

  he raised his eyes and beheld a
very beautiful and very nude young

ginger

woman

  he staggered back his eyes roving
the tiny room as though seeking es-
cape why it was a bathroom and
this young woman was just stepping
out of the tub when he opened the
door

  i beg your pardon he gulped
and stammered dismally

  the girl threw a bath-towel about
her it covered her most incompletely
and glared through her blushes
how dare you she stormed
didnt you hear me singing she
demanded

  yes he repeated i heard you
thats why i came in

  well when you live in a place -
like this singing means to stay out
thats why i was singing because
there wasnt any lock on the bath-
room door

  he managed to open the door un-
der discussion im sorry he
pleaded i didnt realize-

  she shoved him out and slammed
the door after him the idea she
sniffed

  he ventured to tap on the closed
portal i beg your pardon but im
looking for someone he protested
feebly

  well look some other place i
want to come out of here and i have-
nt my bathrobe

  but-bur can you tell me where
to look he persisted

  where to look for what

why for miss donna hissup-
what are you a bill-collector
no i want to see her about a
singing position do you know her 
know her the voice was no
longer fretful i am her a sing-
ing position did i hear you say or
are my ears deceiving me

  you are donna hissup then
oh i was sure of it when i heard
ginger stories



your voice and absent-mindedly
j torrington smell opened the bath-
room door again

  i here came another shriek and
then something warm and wet some-
thing that felt like a bath towel was
flung over his uncovered head mask-
ing his lace and eyes something soft
and yielding bumped into him he
reeled and felt a perfumed presence
run past him with a little excited gig-

   oh kelsey shes the most won-
 derlul stunning ravishing creature

   hammond peered at j torrington
 smell quizzically my lord have
 you fallen again

 smell explained blushingly and
 -and shes going to have dinner with
 me tonight

 where

 here

 oh hell that means ive gotta

gle by the time he had untangled
himself from the bath towel and
blinked his eves the bathroom door
was open and he was alone in the
hall

  a soft voice called to him from be-
hind a door a little further up the
hall if you wont be so impatient
ill put on some clothes and we can
talk like civilized human beings in-
stead of naked savages

  no savage could sing like that
j t orrington protested

  well did you find her kelsey
hammond looked up as hi co-work-
er entered the apartment a bit later

go out damn women anyhow
but j torrington didnt hear him
he was busy at the piano composing
a new love-song

  later that evening hammond
pausing before he went out shook an
admonitory finger at his partner
remember what peggy did to you
he said in warning tones donr go
putting your foot into another mess
like that

  the trouble with you said kel-
sey hammond to j torrington smell
over their breakfast coffee three
weeks later is that youre too slow
you dont know an opportunity

turn over


ginger storifs

when you see one and even if you
recognized it youd be too dumb to
take advantage of it

  what do you mean asked j
torrington

  im talking about this hissop fe-
male youre crazy about her arent
you

  smell shook his head ive sent
her flowers and candy and raised her
pay and promised her the understudy
role in the show and she just smiles
at me and says thank you and thats
all i get

  listen kid you know that
dames got a voice and lots of it-she
could hold down the lead herself and
get away with it like a million bucks
and you know it whats the an-
swer

  i dont know

what i the an-
swer

  you boob ar-
range for her to get
the lead part-on
condition see

  oh i couldnt
do that

  why not its
being done every
day they like it

i tell you fair ex-
change is no rob-
bery

  but how could i
go about it

  oh thats a
mere detail ham-
mond said with an
airy wave of his
hand leave ev-
erything to me
kid

  so j torrington smell left every-
thing to kelsey hammond and two
nights later the stage was set donna
hisup was invited up to their apart-

ment to go over certain interpola-
tions in the score of the show indj
incidentally for a snack of supper

  when she arrived j torrington
was alone where is mr hamond
she asked as he awkwardly helped her
to remove her evening wrap

  he he had to go out her vis-a-
vis explained with a flush youll
stay for a bite anyhow wont you
they ate and retired to the com-
fortable living room smell sat at
the piano and for twenty or thirty
minutes they devoted themselves to
the music under discussion then
smell swung about

  miss hissup donna how would
you like to have the lead in our show
instead of just the understudy part

he asked

  she rose from where she sat her
breath coming in sharp gasps the
-the lead she said in unbelieting

you mean vm to be the leading
lady she gasped unbelievingly
ginger storiei

amazement

  he nodded

   but youre jok-
ing

  im not here
is the contract sec

he showed her the
ready - prepared
form that represent-
ed everything she
had dreamed of for
years

  she sank down on
a c h  i r  limply

oh it cant be
true she said slow-
ly-

  but it is he
said and then he
did a curious thing

he took the con-
tract and its dupli-
cate and deliberate-
ly strode over to the
wall-safe at one side
of the room opened
it and carefully
placed the papers within its steel con-
fines he set a hand and twirled a
dial the door snicked shut

  she looked at him curiously why
did you do that

  he blushed heavily and his voice
squeaked as he answered thats a
time-lock safe he told her and its
set for seven tomorrow morning it
cant be opened until then

  she stared at him questioningly

  he tried to explain the con-
tract is yours when the safe opens
if youll wait for it

  understanding came to her sud-
denly she rose to unsteady feet
ill fake my wrap please she said

  he was taken aback the thing
wasnt going according to ham-
monds premeditated plot at all i she
was turning him down

 as the bath towel struck him a per-
 fumcd presence swept past him with

  gigle-

            it was nine the ner morning whoi
          kelsey hammond returned to th
          apartment j torrington smell was
          dressed there were blue circles under
          his bespectacled eyes donna hissup
          was gone the wrall-safe was open and
          the signed duplicate was on the table-
          did it work old timer kelsey

tropical lure

by malcolm macgregor

slowly her body
began to sway to
the wild tunc on
the phonograph

it was mareea the golden skin-
ned black haired petite half-
caste girl who had prevented
tuan jim holiday from visiting the
meager civilization of moari for more
than six months now as his
schooner came in out of the coral sea
and anchored at the cove of moari
his first thoughts were of her the

thoughts were pleasant memories of
the past mixed with a certain dread
of the future

that first time he set foot on
moari the half caste polynesian had

turn ooer


given herself to
him as completely
and unreservedly
a only such a
girl will bestow
her affections on
anyone who
really touchcs her
heart because
he was loftcsome
and found that
she was the an-
swer to all his de-
sire tuan jim
had taken all she
so willingly of-
fered

  but tuan jim
was new to the
tropics then and
had heard
strange tales of
what happened
to white men
who took natives
or half castes for
sweethearts and
had run away

even when he wanted to stay he
had also heard how fickle is the af-
fection of a half caste and since an
unpleasant affair with a woman in
the states had driven him to the
south seas he was not anxious to
have it repeated he had come to
love mareea greatly and had post-
poned his visit to moari because he
feared a meeting with her would
causc him to weaken but business
for his copra plantation a small
island several hundred miles from
moari had made it necessary for him
to return

  as soon as his boat anchored he
hurried up the beach to the one hotel
moari had to offer two men and
one woman were seated on the ver-
anda and although he knew only
one of the men he nodded pleasantly

ginger storibs

pf pci a almost gasped
as his strong arms
bound yer tightly to
him

to the trio when he entered the
hotel he heard a whispered conver-
sation among them and felt certain
his aftair with mareea was the topic
of it

  it was not until dinner that he
met the woman she was young and
quite pretty with a mischievous
twinkle in her dark eyes that should
not have been there she was intro-
duced to him as betty bettison wife
of die new missionary to the moari
district at that moment her hus-
band was carrying on a religious
campaign among natives in a group
of atolls some distance from moari
he had feared the heat would be too
intense for his wife to accompany
him and had left her in the meager
civilization of moari

  juan jim found her quite inter-
esting and long after dinner was
over sat on the mosquito-netted ver-
anda alone with her for one so
young and particularly as the wife
of an island missionary she seemed
to know much of life and possessed
a great love for it

  t hear you are the one white man
who has been able to resist the lure
of native and half-caste girls she
said suddenly

  tuan jim looked at her with sur-
prise for a moment then with a
smile he admitted that affairs with
native girls were not included in his
weaknesses

  then you havent met pepcta
have you asked the woman

   t dont think  ever heard of her
admitted tuan jim

  then you should know her be-
fore you pass judgment on half-caste
gr  pepeta is the embodiment of
 il life love and passion and wor-
sh pz only pleasure

   i lasnt your husband tried to
convert her

   im afraid my husband has
rcached the point where he is ready

to admit he can never do anything
for her you should meet her some-
time

  thanks but i am quite content
without her acquaintance

  but she is very beautiful especi-
ally in the moonlight her hair is
long and jet black her eyes are large
and dark and one look from them
is enough to make any man forget
himself to see her strolling along
the beach or beneath the trees at
night makes one think of diana i
always feel that men are the object
of her hunt

  tuan jim thought it rather strange
conversation for the wife of a mis-
sionary but he lud seen before
strange emotions brought to the sur-
face by the tropic moon he made
no comment and a short time later
ifter a promise to take betty betti-
son for an inspection of his schooner
naxt day retired to his room

  he had been in his room only a
short time writing several letters he
intended to mail the next day when
he heard a faint rattling at the bam-
boo screen over the window that led
out into the garden looking up he
saw a dainty tapering leg with a
smail leis encircling the ankle pro-
ject its way over the sill

   the leg was so pretty with its gol-
den hue made all the more sensuous
in the moonlight that he watched
eagerly a another leg came over the
window sill to join it dimpled
knees came next into view then well
moulded thighs he expectcd to see
a naked girl enter the room from
behind the bamboo screen but as
the body came further into view he
saw thit a gaudy sash had been tied
about her hips with a great knot in
front then with a sudden bound
the girl leaped into the room and he
saw that the sash was her only article
of clothing except leis about the
neck and wrists and lotus blossoms
in her hair

  for a moment tuan jim had
feared it was mareea for he knew
she would recognize his schooner in
the harbor and would come hunting
for him bue instead it was a
stranger who faced him with a flash-
ing mile of pearly teeth the girl
stood just inside the window her
smile becoming more sensuous as her
grerrt dark eyes surveyed his athletic
body

  good evening mistaire man
she said slowly in a droning voice
that was almost a caress

  who are you demanded tuan
jim

    am pepeta the desire of all men
and i have come to see mistaire
tuan jeem

  i am tuan jim holiday what
do you wish

  ah mistaire tuan jeerri men
do not talk so to pepeta ah no
never and especially mistaire
tuan jeem when i have cometo
dance for them

 tin afraid you have made a mis-

take girl i dont even know you

  ah no but before morning mis-
taire tuan jeem will know pepeta
very welj and will want her to come
back always to dance for him and
love him

  before tuan jim could say any-
thing further the girl walked across
the room turned on the phonograph-
then glided to the center of the room
it was a tango and not the sobbing
notes of a south sea number that
came from the battered machine but
it seemed the sort of wild music that
suited the girl

  for several tense moments she
stood with one hand on her hip and
her head thrown back as she listened
to the music then slowly her body
started to sway as she began a dance
of her own conception it was a
weird sensuous thing that called to
all that was wild in tuan jim and
he felt himself growing weak as he
watched her

  as the phallic gods put into dances
all their desires so did the girl and
tuan jim felt the blood pounding at
his temples with the same great de-
sires each move of the girl made
him want to crush her in his arms
so tightly ic would hurt her yet he
wanted to caress her bare shoulders
tenderly he wanted to kiss her lips
niore vehemently than he had ever
kissed anyone and wantedher to lie
passive in his arms it was not love
but carnal desire he knew now
why white men went mad over half-
caste girls and felt that it must have
been real love he possessed for mareea
because she had only called to the
tender romance in him

  but he was not thinking of mareea
or anyone else as he watched the
sway of pepetas hips the hash of her
dark eyes as she let him know she
found hn desirable her bare breasts
that seemed polished gold in the pale
she h a white devil do not let her deceive you as she did the others 
            urged mareea while the other girl cowered before her

light of the two oil lamps and fired
his blood and the appeal of her ex-
tended arms

  before the dance had been com-
pleted he leaped suddenly to his feet
and gathered her tightly in his arms
pepeta went willingly to him and
held her lips ready to meet his it
was such a kiss as he had never be-
fore known it was the answer to
all passion yet the keynote to more
with his lips pressed rightly to hers

he lifted her bodily from the floor
and carried her to jhe bed

  as he dropped down on the bed
beside her pepeta began running her
fingers through his hair and cares-
sing his cheeks as she murmured sofc
little words of endearment and of-
fered no objections to the liberties
he took with hi hands every few
moment she leaned over and gave
him another of those strange kisses
while he pressed her body close to his

turn over

  look lee at the time were

with little feminine pats and pulls
smoothed her tumbled golden curls
and her charming teagown of peach-

 bloom chiffon

   come she put out her dimpled
 hand and caught his large brown one
 and with a coquettish laugh led him
 from the room

   in the hall she stopped long
 enough to brush his cheeks with her
 long eyelashes-her butterfly kiss
 then she led him through the library
 door and into the booklined room
 glowing and mellow in the waning
 afternoon light

    crossing to the table she took a
 cigarette from a silver box

   quietly leland hinnum watched
 her without a word he took a
 match box from his pocket and held
 a match for her he was so tall and
 she so petite that she almost had to
 stand on tiptoe to light the cigarette
 held in her full red lips

   he smiled down at her-the typi-
 cal soldier erect bronzed and silent
 with keen observant eyes and a firm-
 set mouth

    leaning over he suddenly took the
 cigarette from her lips and kissed her

   nan dear he said youre a
 pretty thing

    he squared his shoulders look out
 a cigarette and as he tapped it on
 his case said quietly

   who is our friend the cat
 when did she appear in our midst
 his eyes were on a china figure set
 on the flat desk under the window
 it was an amusing cat a grotesque
 conception

   huge preposterous whiskers stuck
 out from a mouth that t one mo-
 ment seemed to grin sardonically and
 ar the next appeared merely a china
 cats china mouth but the whiskers
 only helped to give the cat its gro-
 tesquely human expression it was
 the eyes that were really responsible
 for it they were slanted in an in-
 sinuating subtle knowing way that
 gave them a mocking sinister watch-

isnt it cute asked nan jack
brought it in the other day some-
thing fascinatingly uncanny about it
dont you think ira crazy about

kef

  leland lighted his cigarette
thought fully then he smiled
strangely and said

  yes there is a grotesqucrie about
ginger stories

the animal wonder where jack
picked it up he laughed you
know nan i think theres some-
thing strangely like jack himself in
that cat

  yes leland continued in a curi-
ously flat ominous tone ive seen
your husband look exactly like that
especially when hes been watching
you and me

  he turned keen eyes on nans
troubled face

  oh lee what do you mean
you cant mean that jack imagines
that- she broke off abruptly

  that you are seeing too much of
me leland finished her sentence
smoothly well i dont know
there have been times when i have
thought that he did suspect my feel-
ings he laughed again a short
apologetic laugh silly  suppose
but sometimes i get hunches lsed
to have them when i wras in the
trenches i could always tell before-
hand when gas was going to drift
into our trench i guess i got a sort
of superstitious feeling about myself
those days

  his eyes were again fixed thought-
fully on the china cat grinning
through the gathering evening sha-
dows

  oh lee how fascinating nan
clasped her hands together excitedly

  it did come in handy for all of
us once or twice-that hunch of
mine lie went on you see it was
like this ill give you an idea first
of how our trench was so that youll
see how difficult it was to forestall-
he took a pencil and paper from his
pocket and scribbled for a few sec-
onds then he handed the paper
to her

  that was our line he said the
gas drifted down like that-where
those arrows are it might have
ruined all our plansj as you can see

  he was standing by her side she
stared at the paper and grew sud-
denly rigid the color faded slowly
from her face

  leland hannum laughed with
a swift strong motion he caught her
up in his arms he spoke passionately
i want you nan  cant help
it you must listen let him go
lets go away together lord how
i want you

  lee nan found her voice-
she struggled away from him
how dare you take me in your
arms how care you you oi all
men and i trusted you

  leland seemed surprised he
started at her voice and stared at her
closely

  but i thought-i thought that
you cared for me nan his voice
was shaking

  cared for you there was a
fine scorn in her tone cared i r
you i thought i liked you but i
hate you now leland hannum-
hate you do you understand i
detest vou

  but nan-

  his protest was cut short

  go awav she begged leave
me alone i want to be alone if
you dont go ill tell my husband
the whole truth how youve tried to
make love to mo again and again
im sick of it i tell you i want only
jack just jack oh why did i ever
even flirt with you im so
ashamed

  but i love you nan i want
you

  stop her voice was sharp
if you dont go ill ring for mat-
thew her voice broke she sank
into a chair

  all right leland turned away
from her if you feel this way

ber that i am no womans play-

thing

  leland was gone nan sat in the
chair near the huge centcr table
staring with wide startled eyes at the
china cat its eyes seemed more sin-
ister more questioning than ever

  she straightened as her husband
came into the room he walked to
her side and she saw that he was in
good humor

  home so soon she said slowly
i hadnt expected you for hours
yet

  jack pierce smiled he was
slightly inclined toward stoutness
and his small eyes which usually
seemed to glitter were quite passive
now

  rushed back he said in his
thick peculiar tone meeting went
along a little faster than i had ex-
pected how about the follies to-
night

  splendid she replied a little
music would be pleasant

  he leaned over kissed her upon
the forehead

  t run along and phone for
tickets he said and left the room

   nan listened to his foot-falls as he
went up the stairs to his room
again her eyes rested upon the grin-
ning slanting eyes of the cat

  opening her left hand she slowly
uncreased the bit of white paper
which leland hannum had scrawled j
upon again she read

  dictaphone in the cat ire un-
der carpet to another room jacks
probably listening in kick me out
viciously when i make love and then
meet me tomorrow at the club lido
at eight hows that for cats eyes

  nan smiled a mischievous happy
smile she rase and walked to the
humidor as the note llamed she
glanced again at the china cat

  its eyes were delightfully wicked
it was such a clever thing

woman i have been true to tuan
jim but white woman has not been
true to her man look

   before tuan jim realized what she
was about mareea ran across the
room to the bed where pepeta lay
watching her with frightened eyes
with a quick movement mareea
grasped the sash about the other
girls hips and snatched it off

  as tuan jim looked he saw that
the flesh the sash had covered was
white pepeta was a white woman

  dont you know her tuan jim
demanded alareea it is the wife of
the missionary who at night when
her husband is away stains her body
and becomes pepeta in the day she
has all mens respect and at night se-
lects her lovers but mareea lis al-
ways remained true to tuan jim

  as tuan jim stood looking at the
two women one who liad fought for
his love and the other for his pas-
sion the girl who had been pepeta
quickly picked up the sash and
wrapping it hurriedly about her hips
fled from the room through the
same window she had entered

  for several long moments after
she had gone tuan jim sat in a chair
watching the window where she had
disappeared then mareea walked
slowly over and knelt down beside
him taking one of his hands in both
her own

  will tuan jim now be afraid to
take mareea on to his island to live
with him and love him always she
asked

  well go back in the morning
mareea replied tuan jim and
stooping down he lifted mareea to

why should she tell you that

  well kid im him

  kelsey hammond had the grace to
cast his glance downward guess
im not a woman-hater any more at
least as far as donna is concerned
he said were gonna be married
next week

  smell stared at him even even
knowing that she stayed all night
here with me to get the contract
he cried

  kelsey hammond roared with
laughter she told me all about that
wild night with you he gasped be-
tween chuckles  how you begged
her to stay promised not to touch
her and then played dominoes all
night uitj her

  j torrington managed to summon
a grin well i beat her every garni
anyhow he said she cant plav a
good hand of dominoes but there
was a funny glint in his eye and kel-
sey hammond spent most of his mar-
ried life wondering what sort of game

continued from page 

her watchful eyes caught a glimpse
of snowy hair old fascination was
waiting

  no sooner had they landed than
two huge men seized philip and held
him while old fascination opened
the suitcase and hurriedly pawed
over it contents it was all done
so swiftly so quietly that few people
noticed anything out of the ordin-
ary philip seeing the impossibility
of breaking away from the brutes
that held him did not struggle made
no outcry but his face whitened
and took on such a tense strained
expression that julie longed to run
to him to tell him not to worry

  old fascinations wife leaned
against the wall weak and trembling
her big black eyes darting feverishly
about as though seeking a place in
which to hide julie was feminine
enough to feel no sympathy for her
the woman whom her husband loved

  so you would lie to me would
you- the old man exulted softly
picking up the rolled package and
lingering it lovingly gloatingly
expected me to believe that there
never had been any paintings of you
did you his sharp cruel eyes
held his wifes frightened ones while
he slowly untied the string re-
member what i told you would hap-
pen to both you and the man who
dared paint you ah yes i see that
you do recall and you know that
i always keep my word he tore
off the paper his mouth suddenly
grim unyielding a gaudily cov-
ered magazine fell to the floor

  a silly sheepish expression on his
florid face he snatched it up leafed
hurriedly through it then thor-
oughly disgusted he flung it down
again

  you arc delaying us may i ask
for what reason it was philip
caustic voice who ventured this ques-
tion at a sign from the old man
he was released and he faced old
fascination angrily

  -i was told you were carrying
some-pictures of my wife the old
man stammered chagrined and at a
loss

  but i told you that that rumor
about the pictures was not true  his
wife said triumphantly she had
recovered her poise and looked very
completely the outraged grande
dame

  irritably he seized her arm and
was about to walk away when sud-
denly his keen white-lashed blue
eyes encountered julies uneasy gaze
he stopped glanced down at the
small suitcase she carried a slow
smile crept over his face he re-
leased his wife walked deliberately
over to julie

   the dreaded possibility of this had
occurred to her however and she
was not unprepared the grave fact
that her husbands life depended
upon whether or not she could suc-
cessfully manage old fascination
gave her a courage that under vastly
different circumstances  broadway
baby had never had she swun
the suitcase carelessly back and forth
as though unaware that the man s
eyes were fixed intently upor i

  sitting alone on the dct -zt
morning just before the ship ad
docked she had foreseen some sach
difficulty and had decided upon her
own method of defense since old
fascination was noted for and proud
of his ability to get women in this
very power reasoned julie shrewdly
there also lay his weakness if he
enjoyed swaying women to his will
it was inevitable that he should also
like to bs swayed at any rate it

was her only weapon and she decided
to use it

  when he was close beside her but
had not as yet spoken she sidled up
a little nearer her red mouth curlcd
up in a deliberately seductive smile
i regret the untimely-interrup-
tion last night she whispered
glancing up at him through lowered
lashes perhaps to-night going
back-matters could be more satis-
factorily arranged she looked up
with a boldness born of confidence
in her own power and over old
fascinations shoulder her eyes met
the agonized horrified ones of her
husband

game with old fascination find

return he has deserted me the
rogue and i am left very much
alone

  abruptly it dawned upon hamp-
ton that the accident had been
very cleverly planned that the ma-
dame had desired it to happen

  no dear madame he said mov-
ing forward and placing his hands
upon her bare shoulders you are
not alone for am i not here with
you

  indeed monsieur so you are
she laughed walking into his waiting
arms you will not start on your

     in the swim

continued from page 

hose to a seventy foot water unvr
nearby i and mickey were the first
in but the others followed with very
wet smacks before we had a chanco
to lie about the water being fine

   he shrieks and yells would have
quickened a bunch of censors then
the lights went on again one of
them vaunted superior intellects that
colleges are supposed to turn out by
the double gross actually lived up to
expectations mickey was just pull-
ing me out by the skin of my teeth
the only thing he could get a hold on
when the illuminations did their
stuff honest to gawd dearie i al-
most plunged in again

  i had lost my costume

  it turned out later dearie that i
hadnt lost it at all it was merely a
case of glia ran teed unshrinkable scuff
thumbing its nose at the guarantee

  merciful heaven what is
that shrieks the old maiden aunt of
a prexv who had to come at just that
point of a watery tale to cast a ben-
evolent eye around to see if the be-
nign influence was working any-
ways that was what he was supposed
to be doing but between yuh and i
and a telegraph pole dearie he was
really losing both eyes gazing at me

  woman he thundered who
art thou though why its always
my scornful luck to be picked on i
dont know there were plenty oth-
er perfect examples of high art stand-
ing around at that guilty moment

  who me i says elegantly get-
ting my back up it was the only
thing  could get up dearie  say
yuh son of a lady finger pull in your
phantasmazoria dont yuh know a

water nymph when yuh see one
thats what i am a coy little water
nymph

   and do yuh know what that old
 beelzebub said then in rhe name
 of ali the fathers of abraham get
 into the water

   that s a prayerful way of saying
 take a dive dearie so i did and
 that s the first time  ever took will-
 ingly to the h but instead of
 sinking gracefully out of the vulgar
 glare of the limelight i floated
 grandiloquently on the surface

   theres a saying yuh know dearie
 about people of generous proportions
 being like ivory soap pure and non-
 sinkable i reckon im purer than i
 thought  inhaled enough to sink
 the leviathan but i remained within
 sight of all concerned and were
 they concerned a good time was
 had by all but yours truly a case
 of stay  the surface and yuh stay
 all over

    so there i was like a first cousin of
 lady godiva only my mannish hair 
 cut didnt begin to come up to my 
 expectations

   and then as a final publicity stunt 
 that blankety-blank old moon takes
 a header out of the skylight and falls
 into the pool right over my head like
 a halo though gawd knows a halo
 was not what the undressed nymphs
 are wearing at present the spot-
 light behind that deposed moon was
 now turned directly upon me just as
 if i wasnt lit up enough

    tried my level best to sink then i
 held my breath and everything but i
 was like a government bond issue i
 floated on a good foundation archi-
 tecturally speaking dearie well yuh
 know the old saw yuh cant keep a
 good man down i guess maybe it
 applys to the womanly sex as well

   and wiuie ive never fell for this i

   two devils for devlin
   continued from page 

  the two girls were glaring at each
otljer now and their voices were
gradually getting louder devlin
knew that chong who slept only a
couple of rooms down the hall
would hear if they kept this up
and if he heard and reported to
alice  

  toa-lea and tolu were closer to
him than ever working every wile
they knew and they knew a lot of
them in spite of himself al felt
that he couldnt stand this much
longer he jumped out of the bed
and slipped into a robe

  uwe dance for you said tolu
and forthwith she and toa-lea be-
gan to trip an amazing seductive
dance in the moonlight it was a
dance that could mean only one
thing it wasnc suggestive it was
downright invitational

  al had a sudden idea he dashed
to a cabinet and came back with a
couple of boxes of cheroots here
take these and go back to illybo
here take another box for him too
yes you each can keep a box no
dont go out the door for lord
sake climb out the window
now go

  al knew the native girls would do
anything for a box of cigars even
leave what promised to bp p iflwf

esting party they worked on the
principle that after all a man was
only a man but a good cigar was a
smoke he breathed a sigh of re-
lief as they disappeared through the
window and sneaked quietly off bare
of foot in the brilliant moonlight

  the next morning devlin thought
chong looked at him a bit queerly
but he put it down to imagination

  that afternoon chong was out in
a proa in the lagoon fishing for sup-
per devlin lay in a hammock tak-
ing his siesta there was a light
footfall on the veranda and al
opened his eyes then he opened
them wider and opened his mouth
too

  there before him stood a girl
whose only garment was a brilliant-
hued sarong about her middle a
girl whose hair was brown and
whose skin was almost as light as
devlins own like some coryphee
from the folies bergere she stood
there smiling at him swaying ever
so little from the hips and waiting
for him to speak

 who are you he gasped
could this be a native girl her
attire suggested it but otherwise she
seemed to belong more to fifth
avenue than to tongalusa

 im dawn-blossom i am
yours

  mine

  illybo sent me

  you-illy bo-

  she smiled illybo realized that
you didnt care for toa-lea and tolu
or you wouldnt have sent them
back so he gave you me

  but you dont talk like-m
a native she laughed my
father was a white trader and ive
gone through the high school at port
wyrka illybo considers me his
dearest possession but im glad to
get out gf his harem being a qucca

has its drawbacks its confining i
think ill like it here much better

   al stared at her anew she was just
faintly tan and her hair was straight
and kinkless the rest of her well
he just stared then he came out of
his stupefaction he suddenly rea-
lized that there was alice and that
he had given her a promise

  but illybos got me all wrong
dawn-blossom i didnt send those
girls back because i didnt like em

i sent them back because i didnt
want em illybos crazy i dont
want any of his wives im going
to get one of my own soon see
now you go back like a good girl
and put him straight wont you

  you mean you dont want me
die girl came over to him leaned
over him her warm breath in his
face he closed his eyes to ward off
temptation

  go away he said weakly

  you would send me back to that
fat old man look look at me i
am young i am fair i am as white
as you am  not desirable

  he groaned of course you are
damn it you know only too well
how desirable you are but please
go

  her shoulders slumped she
turned away and wandered off down
the path that led to the lagoon

  al shaking mixed himself a
drink if this kept up that two
months were going to be mighty
wearing on the constitution

  at which moment a rich tinkling
laugh came from behind him from
the doorway of his house he
turned startled why why
alice he gasped the red-haired
nirfrse was standing there cool and
entrancing in a frilly pink frock
that made her look more adorable
than shed been in her white uni-
form alice devlin gasped again
ginger storibs

you here

  she came to him my hero she
aid and grinned great big strong
mum to resist such temptation
hi brain reeled yon saw

  she nodded and anyone who
could resist peg malone in such a get-
up deserve plenty of credit she
ttated

  -peg malone-

  yes dawn blossom shes a
pal of mine a nurse too you
see after youd left port vytka i
got lonely for you i was sorry to
have sent you away like that so i
got a launch and peg came along
it was a beautiful moonlight night
and we came here to tongjusa to
see you

    last last night

  yes e got here late and
chong let us in and said you were
asleep but that hed get you up pie
went to your room then came dash-
ia back and called us we peeped
in through a chink in your door and
saw you having such a time with
illvbos envoys

  you saw all that he breathed
haviljr

   she nodded i was satisfied then
that youd keep your word but peg
suggested that perhaps youd be that
way only v here native girls were
concerned so with chongs ltd
we fixed up the little comedy of this
afernoon and oh darling  m so
pl jd of yuu  she offered herself
for a kiss

   then that girl isnt half native
a said after a while-
of course not

  a u ice her be a bridesmaid
then  he said then he whispered
in alices ear she sure has it
hasnt she

   if you think a wait till you see
me the red-haired girl whispered
immodestly
