                  we are looking for more ambitioub young fellows with fae
                  tory building-trade or any other kind of mechanical expo
                  rience to prepare for and help place in well-paid drafting
                  positions such men we find are unusually successful as
                  draftsmen because they know how things are done and thats
                  a priceless asset to the man who makes the blueprint plans

                   for theres a great deal more to drafting than mechanical
drawing and reading blueprints the real jobs those pay-
ing  to  a week give you a chance to cash in on
your entire past mechanical experience get in touch
with me and ill tell you how

drafting it logically tour next moves

of course you realize the biggest handicap to mechanical woik is
that youre limited in earning capacity to the output of your two
hands as long as you live even the skilled mechanic earning 
to s a week has reached his limit he can never earn more and
when he gets old he will earn less so i dont blame any man for
wanting to get away from his futureless outlook for wanting to
get into something where he can use his head as well as his hands-
where he will be paid for what he knows instead of only for what
he does    you know enough about blueprints to understand
that plans govern every move in factory and construction job
the draftsman who makes them is several-jumps ahead of the
workman who follows them and so i want you to know that
drafting is a logical natural promotion from mechanical
and building work-betteripaid more interesting-just the kind cf
work youd enjoy doing

praise is still coming in from the readers of weird tales for bertram
russells strange story in the may issue the scourge of bmoth the
following two letters are samples of the enthusiasm aroused by the tale

    writes mrs f b marshall of fort wayne indiana i can not let the
may issue go by without a word of commendation for this splendid collection
of stories bertram russell in this issue easily tops lovecraft the scourge
of b moth has in my opinion everything that a weird tale should have it is
spine-chilling from start to finish but although weird never makes the reader
stop with a smile and say the writer has overreached here this does not
ring true the sense of complete reality and plausibility is never lost by
all means prevail upon mr russell to give us if possible a story in each
issue  

    ethelle stevens of syracuse new york writes to the eyrie i am not
a regular subscriber to weird tales but the other day by chance i glanced
through your may issue the first story in the book the scourge of bmoth
by bertram russell drew my attention i read it and found it an extremely
weird and interesting tale in fact it was so interesting that i was ten min-
utes late at the office mr russell surely knows his stuff when it eomes to
holding his readers in suspense it has been some time since i have read such
a breath-taking story so from now on i resolve to read weird tales reg-
ularly and the entire office force request that you give us more and more
stories by bertram russell well all be waiting for them

    e l mengshoel of minneapolis writes to the eyrie it was with a cer-
tain amount of satisfaction that i learnt in your last issue that lovecrafts
the dunmch horror had been given the majority of votes for the best story
in the april number satisfaction because i would myself have given that
one my vote if i had voted and moreover i find cause to be less pessimistic
about the literary taste and imaginative faculties of the average reader of
your magazine that story was worthy of a poe in fact i have never read
anything from lovecrafts pen that was not something out of the ordinary
something rendored in a vivid fascinating manner by a genius of extraor-

        strange and ghostly signals were being picked up out of the ether what were

dinary invention and powerful imagination he very nearly persuades even
a matter-of-fact sort of person to take his yarns for facts by the way i
would like to ask him if there has not really existed an old work of writing
named the n ecronomicon which is mentioned in the dunwich horror on
the whole the w t is growing more and more indispensable to me at least
it is a refreshment compared to the mass of literary farce that we are treated
to in the other magazines

    i am an ardent reader of weird tales writes charles a rinschler of
cincinnati and wish to state that i enjoy your stories very much especially
scientific fiction of interplanetary space and highly imaginative stories of the
little known regions of our own planet the first installment of the last of
the mayas is a great imaginative story that has a ring of truth to it and heres
hoping you will publish more like it

    edwin meyers of oakland california writes to the eyrie i recently
read the moon terror it was a great story why not continue putting out
books reprinted from your magazine my favorite author is of course sea
bury quinn my friend and i commute to san francisco to work and spend
many hours of our daily rides on the ferry discussing jules de grandin that
little frog is the greatest character any author ever created i remember
one story in particular about jules de grandin that appeared about two years
ago it was called the white lady of the orphanage for sheer horror and
amazement it could not be beaten

    l h hardingham of san francisco suggests why dont you inaug-
urate a department and call it the philosophers stone the alchemist the
alchemists corner or some name like that that would appease the insatiable
desire of your readers for magic in some measure it would deal with the
whole field of magic saracenic greek mediaeval alchemy and so on a cor-
respondence could be carried on with the readers who would fire in all sorts
of questions relating to the weird beliefs of other centuries and a compre-
hensive investigation could be made into the whole field of alchemy and
mysticism in the course of a year or two quotations from roger bacon
browne paracelsus and hosts of others will furnish a realistic background
and their works can be interpreted in the light of modem science i think it
could be made one of the most fascinating features of the magazine

    writes philip almond of vancouver british columbia i want to com-
mend seabury quinns the house of golden masks as an acceptable and ex-
citing story those of this kind girl-torture narratives always appeal to the
imagination and that is the object of weird tales and do not tax the
readers credulity but thrill him quinns older story the man who cast
no shadow and captain eliots the copper bowl were similar and a-l too
let as have more i noticed a lady urging this and the ordeals can not be too

peaking of women said
chaulieu i would never
wish any of you a honeymoon
like the one i took with my first wife
besides coming very close to losing
our lives    but heres the story
without any further preamble on
my return from saigon i asked head-
quarters for a furlough and took
advantage of it to marry little maria-
lucc of mourillon as had been pre-
viously decided her father had died
in madagascar and she lived with her
grandfather

 we went to switzerland on our
honeymoon it was my idea because
at heart im a staid fellow a land-
lubber and i hate adventures if i
was a sea captain for twenty years it
was simply to follow the family tradi-

  translated by mildred gleason prochet

tion and to please my parents but the
very thought of it in the beginning
made me seasick

  well there we were in switzer-
land my young bride and i as in
the days of toppfer we were very
much in love and    have you
ever been in soleure

  i was married in borneo chuck-
led dorat the biggest wag in the
party of old sea-dogs who spun their
yarns on the terrace of the caf
of the old wet-dock in toulon

  i see    well soleure might
be called the capital of french swit-
zerland-a long quiet street with pic-
ture sign-boards swinging on their
rods at the slightest puff of wind from
the wesseinstein

  the wesseinstein is one of the
summits in the jura mountains it


rises at the northwest of the town
more than one tourist has lost his way
in the gorges and paths of the forest
and there are no hotels before reach-
ing the summit with the exception of
one which at the time boasted a very
sinister reputation

 two years before our trip the
town board had discovered at the bot-
tom of a well and in a near-by grotto
twelve skeletons and some objects be-
longing to travelers who had found a
fatal hospitality there

    the inquest in investigations
brought to light the fact that the
crimes had been committed by a
couple who had so thoroughly terror-

ized the neighborhood that even the
death of the two innkeepers the dread-
ful weisbachs - you may remember
the story perhaps it was in all the
newspapers at the time-did not loos-
en any tongues you see a few old-
timers in the mountains had suspected
some of the goings-on but jean weis-
bach had made it very clear that he
did not care to have people meddling
in his business and they had let bad
enough alone

  the innkeepers had died quietly
in their beds in the end rich and es-
teemed as also did their factotum one
daniel when the mares nest was
discovered the examining magistrates

                                   

what she was telling
was less horrible than
what she did


weird tales

were able after questioning hither and
yon and forcing some stubborn old
neighbors to speak to reconstruct the
crimes the most important witness
was an old woman with a goiter who
related certain horrible details which
showed that besides a grim greed for
money the weisbachs had had a
strain of sadism and cruelty in them
that has rarely been exceeded

  naturally this story was the chief
topic of conversation in soleure the
travelers who were to go by coach to
the peak of the wesseinstein to sleep
in the hotel made famous by napol-
eon and from there go back into
france through the belfort gap
promised themselves by all means to
stop for a drink half-way up at the
inn of blood it had been called
that as much because of the story as
for the color it was painted to stop
there was one of the things planned
in the trip up the mountain while
the driver gave the horses to drink
the tourists went inside to the bar and
gossiped with the new proprietors
these two had been there only a year
their predecessors the immediate suc-
cessors of the weisbachs had left the
premises as soon as the scandal broke
on the grounds that they were ruined
but the scheffers being shrewder had
said to themselves that there were
plenty of fools in the world whose
curiosity would probably make them
rich their reasoning had not been
bad if one could believe what was
said in town all the strangers now
passing through soleure wanted of
all things to see the inn of blood
and some even went so far as to sleep
there

    the weather was fine the day that
maria-luee and i left for the wes-
seinstein by diligence we had had
an excellent lunch and were prepared
to enjoy a lovely drive and live a few
ideally romantic hours like a chapter
from a novel we had left our lug-
gage in soleure and were to return
there for it maria-luce had only a
small hand-bag with her ah we

narrowly missed never returning to
soleure and also lived that romantic
chapter of ours in a way we would
never have wished you will see
why   

  when i think of it    perhaps
that is what killed my good little
maria-luce    she was so pretty
so gay so full of life    with such
a clear lovely skin and cheeks like
roses well such is life-a never-tiring
destroyer  i often wonder why
we are born at all   

  ah we were in love    iliad
hired the coupe of the stage-coacli
just for the two of us so that we could
be by ourselves and kiss when we felt
like it which was only natural after
all

tc t ust as we were about to leave
j a man and woman arrived on
the scene  a handsome pair i 
never forget them as long as i live
and with reason they were italians
he a big handsome man too hand-
some in the thirties with big dark
eyes like velvet the kind of eyes they
have in italy and that make the
signorinas lose their heads   
flashing teeth olive skin clean-shaven
and the appearance of an actor he
was one in fact a tenor who was al-
ready well-known and had had a bril-
liant success at la scala in milan   
antonio ferretti as we learned
later    amiable jovial in per-
fect health he felt that he owned the
world

  his companion who adored him
openly with every look was obviously
his body and soul she was a young
ravishingly beautiful woman as
golden-haired as a venetian which she
was and belonging to the highest
aristocracy her name belonged to
history from that day on judicial his-
tory alas    countess olivia or-
sino the handsome tenor had ab-
ducted her

   im telling you all this at the start
to get rid of it so that you can under-
stand the people at first sight which
the inn op terror



was more than we did all we consid-
ered at the moment was the fact that
an annoying couple wanted to join us
in the coupe under the pretense that
the interior compartment of the coach
was already practically full and
would even have driven us out if it
had been possible an argument en-
sued of course the handsome tenors
free and easy manner irritated me
and i was even more annoyed because

i	had been so pleased with the idea of
just the two of us taking this little
trip together if he had been more
polite however antonio ferretti
would certainly have won his cause
because after all im not a roughneck
and as i said before his companion
was charming

  maria-luce advised me to give in
but one word spoiled everything
something like damned savages
these french i slammed the door
violently and as i had already paid
for the four seats i insisted on my
right and they were obliged to sit
with the others as a matter of fact
if it annoyed them to travel by dil-
igence they had only to rent a car-
riage but it wasnt an easy thing in
those days before automobiles to find
horses and carriage to go up to the
wesseinstein they had to be wagons
specially built like the diligence with
a hanging rod always ready to grip
the road in case of slipping back
which was always to be feared if i
have lingered over this incident it is
because it assumed a terrible impor-
tance alas for some of us

  our drive started through a pretty
little cut in the hills fresh wooded
resounding with rippling waters and
in which nestles a little retreat fa-
mous in that neighborhood-it was
that of saint venere verena ein-
siedolei if im not mistaken-with
chapels grottoes overhanging rocks
and from time to time beautiful
blocks of soleure marble which caught
the sun and shone in great blinding
spots

  three hours later we were in the

depths of the forest far from any
dwelling and the sun had disap-
peared big clouds floated between
us and the mountain peaks and be-
fore long a black veil hid the entire
valley at the same time a dull noise
like thunder rumbled down toward
us but it was not the thunder yet
it was a heavy sledge loaded with
wood which tumbled down the road
on its runners with overwhelming
rapidity a young boy perched up
on top steered it

  it was under the threat of a com-
ing storm that we finally caught sight
of the inn of blood in the livid
light of the twilight it was not a
pleasant sight with its squat thick
walls barred windows and the old
arched door studded with iron which
led to the famous well the whole
was covered with a horrible brownish
paint which it seems is used on the
arms of the guillotine

   heavens but its ugly maria-
luce cried and it really must have
been for that afternoon i can assure
you we were both in a mood to find
everything lovely we had not been
bored with each other on the ride up
we had told each other stories we had
made plans for the future and we had
kissed to the health of our two italians

 t ust as the diligence stopped in
j front of this sinister dwelling a
regular torrent of rain accompanied
by flashes of lightning and great
growls of thunder came down we
rushed into the inn or rather into an
enormous kitchen at the end of which
was a tremendous fireplace large
enough to bum a tree at the present
moment however only an honest lit-
tle fire of dried branches was crack-
ling away and above it in an honest
little pot hung from a pot-hook
boiled a beef stew which smelled ex-
cellent before us stood the innkeep-
er round-bellied like a barrel with a
pleasant manner small twinkling
eyes peering out from creases of fat


weird tales

and three chins the tamest ogre in
the world all smiles

  are you reassuredv i asked
maria-luce

   yes she answered he wont
have us cooked in that little pot and
he seems delighted    but what
weather

  as a matter of fact the driver
had unharnessed the horses and got-
ten them under shelter because he was
beginning to worry about the equilib-
rium of the carriage under the re-
peated claps of thunder i asked him
how long we would be staying here

   an hour he answered ill be
off again in an hour no matter what
the weather does

  	 i figured that we would arrive at
the hotel at the wesseinstein in the
middle of the night if we arrived at
all because the road skilled a preci-
pice  the right i came to a rapid
decision and maria-luce agreed with
me so taking the innkeeper aside i
asked him if he had a room

   i have two the stout fellow an-
swered looking at me with a banter-
ing twinkle in his eyes you want to
sleep here

   yes show me your rooms

   if youll just wait a moment un-
til i have served the lady and gentle-
man in the drawing-room ill be at
your service 

  what he called the drawing-room
was a small room off the kitchen fur-
nished with a round table covered
with oil-cloth four chairs and a few
prints of the battles of the first em-
pire hanging on the wails which were
whitewashed our two italians had
made for this luxurious and comfort-
able nook on leaving the coach in or-
der to escape from associations from
which they had already suffered

  when scheffer the innkeeper
opened the door which they had
closed i saw the handsome tenor at
the window looking out at the land-
scape sadly his companion was seat-
ed with her elbows on the table ana
did not seem any more cheerful

    the innkeeper came back to us

  	  there are two more who want to
sleep here a drive in this rain
doesnt attract them you had bet-
ter hurry about choosing your room
because between you and me there
is only one decent one

  you can well imagine that i lost
no time we went up a stairway as
steep as a ladder that led on the left
to the attic which was directly over
the kitchen and on the right to a cor-
ridor which went to what was called
the travelers room this room was
famous it was here that almost all
the murdered guests had slept

   you arent afraid scheffer
chuckled on opening the door but
then of course nowadays only honey-
mooners come here

   that is true of us

   oh then i wont worry about
you he replied you wont have any
bad dreams have you any luggagev
 no we left it at soleure

  it seemed to me that this detail-
irritated him that may have been
an idea that i invented later later
i also remembered that he eyed maria-
luces bag the jewels she wore and
even the big ring i wore very keenly
but i wont swear to it he did it
very quickly before leaving us out-
side it was still pouring but the
thunder had stopped



in the fading light of the day this
i room seemed a very peaceful re-
treat to us it was large and clean
with light flowered wall-paper a big
lied with white sheets and an enor-
mous red eider-down quilt a comfort-
able morris chair the mantel deco-
rated with bouquets of orange blossoms
under a glass globe and two pictures
taken from monsieur de chateau-
briands atala and the last of the
abencerages the subject of which i
explained to maria-luce

   well be very comfortable here
she remarked and if you were nice
the inn op terror



youd have a fire built on the hearth
and wed dine together in our room
 good idea ill go right down
and tell our landlord

   ill come with you she cried
youre not going to leave me alone
in this room 

 ah it bothers you just the
same   

     heavens yes when i think-

   very well come along and dont
think 

  we were at the head of the stairs
in front of the door of the attic when
we heard the italians voice

     but this isnt a room   antonie
was exclaiming its a garret its
a dirty hole   

   its the only thing i have to
give you  the innkeeper answered  i
have already explained that my other
room is taken  

 the door opened and we found
ourselves face to face with the two
italians and the innkeeper

   ah you again signor the ten-
or exclaimed you must admit that
we are out of luck 

  i could not stop a smile i had
caught sight of an iron bed in one
corner of the attic which was stuffed
with all the dull rusty articles that
one is accustomed to store in such
places

   in fact i answered this is not
a very comfortable place to sleep in
especially when one is accustomed to
a certain amount of luxury do you
know what i would do in your place
now that the coupe is free i would
leave with the diligence

   he is right agreed the signora
 he is making fun of us the
other muttered between his teeth

  i saw that there might be trou-
ble so i carried maria-luce off and
went back down into the large public
room of the inn

 tn spite of the rain the other trav-
j- elers had wanted to see the well
where the executioners had thrown
their victims and they all returned

dripping wet they ordered hot grogs
while the innkeeper still joking a bit
sarcastically gave details

   they probably didnt drink the
water from that well-everyone has
his little niceties-but the peasants
around here did after all it didnt
matter much because the weisbachs
did things neatly they cleaned their
skeletons well they boiled them for
hours and hours in a cauldron that
hung from that very pot-hook 
upon which the travelers asked
to see the cauldron the pitchfork the
ax and the knife all the instruments
of torture in fact that had become
famous in this horrible affair

   they are in the little dun-
geon    and my wife has the key
madame scheffer detained at
some foresters because of the weath-
er took her time about returning
the driver announced in the mean-
time that he was ready to leave and
the room emptied itself in a moment

  the italians did not come down
until after the diligence had left
they seemed to have made up their
minds to make the best of their part
in the adventure and ordered dinner
we watched them out of the comer
of our eyes and maria-luce was very
much amused  i was extremely po-
lite and opened the conversation

   if i had been alone i would
have given my room up willingly    
 a bad night is soon over the
italian answered me with a smile

  the woman whom ill call count-
ess orsino although i did not know
her name at the time was charming to
maria-luce

   we have been cheated she said
to her this inn is not at all horrible
a door at the end of the room
opened and madame scheffer the
innkeepers wife entered she rid
herself of an enormous coat and hood
and as she did so we could not con-
trol the chill of terror that ran up
our spines the sight was worse than
horrible it was sinister her hid-
eousness was due mostly to her squint-


weird tales

ing eyes and enormous grinning
mouth aside from that she had
sparkling teeth beautiful golden hair
and a nose that was a bit thick with
ferociously sensual nostrils i dont
know what madame weisbach was
like but this woman certainly seemed
to exhale an odor of blood she was
strong and still young about thirty-
eight with firm limbs and hands used
to mens work

   behind her came the man-servant
whom we had not yet seen he was
thick-set slightly humpbacked and he
limped a red-head with the face of
a brute

    he threw down the burden he was
hidden under on the paving and gave
a sigh of relief then he looked at
us in silence and lifted a trap-door
under the stairs he lighted a lamp
which was there prepared and dis-
appeared down into the cellar drag-
ging his bundle behind him the inn-
keeper was cleaning the dirty wine-
glasses and no one had said a word
the three of them had looked at us
in silence that was all

   im frightened this time maria-
luce whispered to me

   yes its beginning to become
more interesting i answered but
dont get worked up and well have
some fun out of it 

  the innkeeper was the first to
break the silence after his wife had
disappeared into the cellar behind the
servant

  	  what do you think of my wife  
he asked she fits in well in an inn
like this doesnt she i couldnt
have chosen better    

  i joined in the game yes its
quite a good trick 

  the little countess had retreated
into the shadow of her handsome
tenor and he remarked pleasantly
 madame scheffer would be very good-
looking if she didnt squint 

   if she hadnt squinted i would
not have married her the innkeeper
answered weisbachs wife squinted

and i wonder if you noticed my man-
servant    hes humpbacked and
bow-legged like daniel the weis-
bachs servant i had to go all the
way to chaux-de-fonds to find him
 why dont you laugh olivia
asked the tenor who seemed to be en-
joying himself

   did they ever murder anyone
in the attic   olivia gasped

     did they ever murder anyone in
the attic scheffer exclaimed well
i should say so i have all the news-
papers if you want to look them over
daniel slept in the attic and stood
guard over the travelers in the other
room when he believed that they
were safely asleep he would knock
three times on the floor and the weis-
bachs who kept themselves in readi-
ness for the signal came up   

   sometimes the deed was easily
and quietly done other times there
was a scuffle the woman with the
goiter told how mengal from breslau
president of the court of justice de-
fended himself so well that his wife
was able to escape but on leaving the
room the unfortunate woman rushed
into the attic where daniel always
waited holding himself in readiness
to help he broke her skull in with
one blow of the ax   you will see
the ax    

   how horrible moaned the
countess

   oh thats nothing the inn-
keeper went on shrugging his shoul-
ders there are lots of other tales
about them that are more interesting
than this and im not making them
up theres the one about the beau-
tiful brunette chained down in the
grotto but you ought to reconstruct
the scene of the tale for yourselves in
the little dungeon if you are fond of
such things you will also see the
pitchfork that the weisbachs used to
caress the little brunette    

  i felt maria-luces hand tremble
in mine

   give me a light i said to the
innkeeper and when i had lighted
the inn of terror



my pipe scheffer youre a dirty
fraud 

   by gad no what about the
inquest    and the newspapers

  	  possible    but you make me
laugh with your ax and your pitch-
fork  its as though you told me that
the weisbachs cooked their victims in
that pot over there 

   youre a shrewd one he burst
out with a roar of laughter but i
found the cauldron i need yesterday
my wife went to pay for it today and
the man brought it back with some
other little things that wont go badly
with the landscape yes its true
im helping the atmosphere along a
little  it was my idea    and
when everything is just as it was be-
fore people will feel that they are
back in the times of the weis-
bachs    but you must believe   
when i tell you that this is the
cauldron this the ax and this the
pitchfork you must believe or theres
no fun in it    but then youre
not an amateur in such things   
what i am doing is for the amateurs
who specialize in horrors the fact
that it is the actual dungeon the well
and the inn is a good start and with
a little imagination it wont be hard
to believe that the crimes have just
been committed    without count-
ing the fact that my wife and servant
are a stroke of genius  i hope
to be rich in ten years when i think
that the people who were here before
me had the travelers room done over
and added a drawing-room    the
fools as though it were possible to
ruin the inn of blood like that

  he sighed and went on you see
im not trying to put anything over
on you youre not out for thrills so
i have shown you the inside of every-
thing but there are people who
would be angry with me if i were to
give the show away there are some
you know who love it    dont be
afraid little lady he said to the
countess if the idea that you are go-
ing to sleep in the attic where they

murdered that poor woman upsets
you ill have a mattress put in the
drawing-room 

   no well sleep in the attic an-
tonio ferretti declared

   very well and you the inn-
keeper asked turning to me  does the
idea of sleeping in the travelers
room bother you

   not a bit not a bit does it
maria-luce  

   oh the whole place frightens
me maria-luce answered

  at that we three men burst out
laughing and the women joined us at
the end but only half-heartedly



 at adame scheffer reappeared out
-iva f the trap-door followed by
the servant and we stopped laughing
immediately only scheffer seemed
vastly amused by the effect that his
wife had had on us he called out to his
servantdaniel    like the other
one

  he ordered him to wring the neck
of two chickens but olivia said that
she was not hungry and that a cup of
bouillon would satisfy her

   excuse me but i am antonio
protested and a chicken wont fright-
en me

   and you i asked maria-luce
 nor me she answered squeezing
up close to me that is the only thing
in the house that doesnt frighten me
 shall we dine together an-
tonio asked he had obviously for-
gotten the incident of the diligence

   no thank you i answered
 ive had a fire lit in our room and my
wife and i will dine alone in our
quarters 

   its very nice up there he re-
plied smiling  i have seen the room
youre in luck i can understand
how people sleep there even at the risk
of being murdered

   you are cheerful

   oh im only speaking of those
who were before you


weird tales

  the innkeeper started to rattle
some keys he had just lighted the
lamps as night had completely fallen

   while waiting for dinner ill
show you around the rain has
stopped and we can go to the well to
the grotto and in the stable 

  the women hesitated but we per-
suaded them to follow us the inn-
keeper went ahead with a swinging
lantern and in the stable in front of
the well and in the grotto which was
about a hundred yards from the inn
and the existence of which had been
ignored for a long time he recon-
structed the whole story-and more
he put in a few details of his own
the crimes of the peyrebelle inn
were mere trifles compared to the
crime of the inn of blood

  the weisbachs had made a sort
of crematory oven out of one end of
the grotto and some fragments of
human bones too large to be con-
fused with the bones of sheep had
been found there

    it was useless trying to be strong-
minded  we all came back from that
little expedition somewhat upset we
were glad to re-enter the big room of
the inn with its cheerful hearth   
and yet    yes but over the fire
two chickens were turning on the
spit and filled the air with an ex-
tremely pleasant aroma the bow-
legged servant basted them from
time to time with their juice mean-
while polishing up a big leather
basin

   what are you doing i asked
him

  he lifted his brute face up to-
ward me and went on with his rub-
bing

   dont ask daniel questions
the innkeeper said with a little laugh
its a waste of time because he
wont answer you not that he is
dumb but i have ordered him to be
mute like the other who really was
you understand

   oh yes i understand con-

gratulations you havent overlooked
a thing 

   nothing and when the caul-
dron is on the hearth youll see what
a sensation ill make when i repeat
the story told to the judge by the
woman with the goiter

   what was that antonio asked

   why the story of what hap-
pened to her when she first awoke to
the fact that she was working for very
peculiar people one night when she
came in from her washing she found
a roaring fire on the hearth she went
closer to see what they were cooking
in the pot and she lifted the cover
but weisbach appeared on the run
and gave her a blow that sent her
reeling against the wall but she had
seen    she had seen a mans head
turning around in the bouillon sur-
rounded by chunks of flesh

     you see weisbach said to
her curiosity is always punished if
i did what was right id send you to
the bottom of the pot to find out what
is going on there but i need you
in the meantime keep your mouth
shut

  	  the wretched woman threw her-
self at his feet swearing that she
would never speak and she stayed
with him because she knew that they
would never let her go alive from
that day  they talked openly be-
fore her and there were even some
nights when they forced her to help
them in many ways they would tell
her to follow them down to the grotto
and close the argument by kicking her
down ahead of them   

   come lets go down there now
itfe the best part of the whole place

 and he picked up his lantern
again

    the women exchanged looks then
catching sight of the bow-legged man
who was staring at them covertly
while he continued to polish his caul-
dron they made up their minds and
we went down into the cellar behind
scheffer a slimy stairway a greasy
cord weird shadows thrown by his
the ink op terror



flickering light  it was awful
we soon heard ringing blows like
those of a hammer beating against
chains and as a matter of fact that
is what it was at the end of a sub-
terranean passage the man threw
open a door and we saw another lan-
tern on the damp earth of the vault
madame scheffer was crouched on the
ground busy fastening a piece of
chain to a ring in the cave wall from
which hung a lantern at the end of
the chain there was an iron collar
she had her back to us and did not
bother even to look up but continued
her hammering with the violence of a
madwoman at last she stopped a
moment

   that the man explained i
have had to have done but its old
iron just the same the marks of the
hammer wont show as soon as it has
rusted and some people will be even
able to find blood-stains 

  what a beast i murmured
there is no possible way of being
bored with you 

  no eh nor with my wife   
wait and shell give you a thrill
shell tell you the story of the pretty
little brunette who was imprisoned in
this cave its worth the trouble of
listening    

   you ought to set up your little
trick in paris boulevard roche-
chouart near the cafe of the yellow-
hammer youd be a big success

   i know he answered ive trav-
eled there are plenty of fools in the
world 

nphe grotto was not very big

  - nevertheless there was room
enough for a little exhibit an enor-
mous rusty knife a saw an ax and
all the necessary implements for an
innkeeper who conducts his business
in the way that the deceased weis-
bach did hung from nails embedded
between the cracks of the stones in
one place were a pitchfork and an ox-
goad against the wall were some
tongs some shapeless colorless rags

also hung from stalactites once it
seems they had been clothes and in
another spot was a pile of debris
which included some pieces of old
leather all that remained of some
shoes

   read my collection of news-
papers and you will see that all this
stuff is mentioned i havent made up
a thing unfortunately the police
kept all the originals and i had to re-
place them as best i could he
laughed and said to his wife go to
it its your turn now 

    she stood up and came toward us
and we shrank back i shall see
those squinting eyes and that big
mouth all the rest of my life and
what a setting the whole was
brought into fantastic relief by the
fierce blood-red light thrown by the
two lanterns one of which was still on
the ground it was like a horrible
evil etching 

  the woman put out her arms and
grasped the pitchfork almost greedily
and as she spoke she glared at the
little countess with such ferocity that
the other was forced to turn away 
and what a voice it was like a
sound from hell

   and yet you know scheffer said
to us  she only drinks her little swal-
low of brandy in the morning after
her coffee like the rest of the world
good old annette he called her
annette like the other one you
will see what a wonder she is 

   perhaps one of the ladies would
like to try the iron collar  she began
it doesnt matter that madame is
blond it would be just as effective

  but the suggestion was not very
well received and annette smiled a
horrible smile

     everyone to his own taste this
is what happened according to the
woman with the goiter a beautiful
brunette arrived one afternoon accom-
panied by a middle-aged gentleman
they were obviously rich and had
lots of jewelry a mishap to their
carriage forced them to take shelter


weird tales

at the inn for the night and the
coachman who went back to soleure
was to return the next day with anoth-
er carriage for them when he
arrived the next morning he was in-
formed that the two had departed
early in the morning and that they
had left money for him he took the
amount coming to him and went off
without bothering any further about
his customers but his customers had
never left the inn   

   the gentleman knocked uncon-
scious by daniel and cut up into
pieces by weisbach was already in
the cauldron as to the lovely bru-
nette she was still alive in the little
grotto    she lived there for fif-
teen days according to the woman
with the goiter every night as soon
as the inn was closed they went down
to see her they had her chained
down there to this iron collar one
evening the woman with the goiter
heard cries and slipped down into the
cellar but weisbach who had sharp
ears discovered her he dragged her
into the vault you want to see
he said to her   then see you must
see what will happen to you if you
talk   and she saw   

   the lovely brunette was there
completely naked and chained as i
have already described she was just
one piece of tom flesh and weis-
bach s wife now with the pitchfork
now with the goad was stroking her
ribs 

  so saying madame seheffer went
into action and what she was telling
was less horrible than what she did
half bent over herself with a savage
light in her eyes and that enormous
mouth foaming at the comers she
hurled first her fork and then her goad
where the chain hung and she did it
with a fiie that suddenly ceased to be
play and became a kind of madness
and wild enjoyment

    the slut she screamed and the
sound of her voice sent a chill up my
spine she killed the poor little bru-
nette like this like this and again

and again she crushed in her ribs tore
the flesh while the walls resounded with
the others cries of pain now youre
beautiful let your lover come now
ah and this too now you are more
beautiful than i 

   i must tell you madame schef-
fer said panting and turning toward
us or rather toward the little count-
ess who had to lean against the wall
to keep from falling  i must explain
that weisbachs wife was as ugly as
sin and she squinted naturally she
could not bear the sight of beautiful
eyes-so saying madame scheffer
stared straight into the little count-
ess eyes - without wanting to
scratch them out

      lets go lets go  olivia orsino
cried i wont stay here another sec-
ond   and she rushed from the
vault

  we all followed her and scheffer
who was behind said with a great
laugh i told you she was priceless
she has learned her lesson well but
dont let it upset you aside from
that she is as gentle as a lamb   
and an excellent cook too as you will
see

  and then the woman herself
who had joined us said so i fright-
ened you well i must tell the story
it will make people come



  t pelt maria-luce tremble and we

  a were all a little pale when we
came back into the big room we
looked at each other and finally burst
out laughing  all except the
countess

   what a horrible horrible
woman  she murmured

   and with all that you dont
know the end of the story said
scheffer jabbing at the chickens with
a fork to see how nearly done they
were he stopped the string which
turned the spit  they are done to a
turn and with a good salad   
youll praise our cook    the end
of the story is this the day when
the inn of terror



the -woman with the goiter was
dragged into the vault was the day in
which madame weisbach scratched
the little brunettes eyes out with the
pitchfork she would teach the other
to have more beautiful eyes than her
own

   squint now squint now is
what she shrieked madame scheffer
completed loading herself with a pile
of dishes from a large chest

   enough i said firmly weve
had enough of an appetizer lets
eat

   do you know what the italian
woman said to me   maria-luce whis-
pered she doesnt want us to leave
them lets eat down here 

   oh no i protested im sick of
these stories and i want you all to
myself 

  we took leave of the other two and
i led my wife upstairs we had a
little trouble in finding our room in
that strange hallway the stairs were
so steep that we came near to toppling
down them and it made me think of
the weisbachs the traveler would go
up the stairs while the servant waited
for him in the dark at the top and
pushed him down to the innkeepers
who were waiting at the bottom and
that was the end of him

  we however were a bit luckier
and as there was only one room in the
inn we finally found it but before
locating it i opened doors into several
other rooms filled with packing-cases
and all sorts of debris i wrondered
why in an inn they did not make use
of so much precious space and while
scheffer was serving us our supper in
front of a good fire and under a tame
enough lamp i could not help asking
him for an explanation of this he
answered that it would be a great
expense useless perhaps    and
finally after hesitating a moment he
added

   besides it seems to me that the
weisbachs did not care to have too
many travelers at one time

  and he left after putting a bottle

of champagne on the table and wish-
ing us good-night

     did you hear   maria-luce whis-
pered to me as soon as he was gone
but why does he want to leave things
in the same condition

   he hasnt been here long give
him a chance youre not going to
begin imagining things are you
by the time supper was over i
had cheered her up again we had
emptied our bottle of champagne
gayly and forgotten all about the hor-
rors we were just about to go to
bed when a light knock came at the
door    there was no bolt in this
door but there was a key and a sort
of hook that fastened to a ring in the
casing

   who is there i asked

   dont open maria-luce whis-
pered she was already terror-strick-
en for we had made quite an evening
of it and might well be supposed
asleep   

     open open quickly  came a heavy
voice which i recognized as the ital-
ian s

  at that i opened the door and the
man threw himself into the room
shutting the door behind him he
was very pale and seemed in the
throes of the wildest emotion   

   ive come to warn you he ex-
claimed his voice trembling with
emotion first of all we can hear
everything they say in the kitchen
these people are murderers i heard
his wife say to scheffer we have
nothing to fear if they find the
bones theyll think they belonged to
that other affair were not going
to stay another second in this den
ive found a rope in the attic and
ive fastened it to the window-ledge
that overlooks the outside of the house
not the courtyard get dressed and
follow us 

  maria-luce was already half un-
dressed and i had thrown my coat on
the chair

   this is a fine tale i exclaimed
dumfounded


weird tales

   you didnt see that womans
eyes  said maria-luce her teeth chat-
tering with fright

  seeing that i was undecided the
italian lost no time and left us
maria-luce was dressing hastily
shaking in every limb

   lets go lets go she begged
you havent even a revolver

  that was true and besides it
was impossible to oppose maria-luce
i took the bag and two minutes later
we were in the attic after removing
our shoes to make no noise the little
wooden door of the garret window
was open and the cord fastened to the
screw of a pulley the italians had
already gone we put our shoes on
hastily and it was then that i dis-
covered a little streak of light coming
through a crack in the floor it came
up from the kitchen and i tried to
peer through it i saw nothing but
i could hear scheffers voice say
which one shall we begin on 

chaulieu had reached this point in
his narrative when captain
michel hit the table with such a blow
of his fist that the saucers under their
glasses jumped

  i expected that what an orig-
inal story but in paul-louis cour-
iers tale the innkeeper says shall we
kill them both and he was only re-
ferring to two chickens you take us
for geese chaulieu  

  wait a minute said chaulieu
i dont know what this paul-louis
thing of your is-i dont know him
from the man in the moon-and if
you are geese inform your respective
relations of the fact    im telling
the adventure just as it happened to
me

  let him finish said dorat ill
bet he had forgotten all about love
when he heard those words  

  yes old man i certainly had and
so had maria-luce and i can tell you
we lost no time in making our escape
i made another knot in the cord and

grasped hold of it maria-luce to
whom i had given the bag which con-
tained quite a large sum of money
and our toilet articles got up on my
shoulders and when we reached the
ground we ran for ten minutes with-
out stopping we started down to-
ward soleure by the first path we
came to because we did not dare risk
the main road i expected to catch
up to the italians but we lost our-
selves in the pitch-black darkness
slipping and sliding and falling on
the soaked ground we plunged on
madly

  you were frightened to death by
that time laughed michel

  i should say we were i couldnt
even stop maria-luce who thought
we were being pursued by bandits
ready to shoot us down at any minute
the worst was that it began to rain
again-and how    good lord
what a night    lost in a forest
torn and scratched by branches and
pelted with the heaviest kind of rain
never in my life have i ever spent
such hours and i finally had to carry
maria-luce who was nothing more
than a dripping bundle of rags  at
last alight a peasants cottage   
they took us in warmed us and
gave us a bed they dried our clothes
for us and in emptying my pockets i
found a piece of paper with a few
words written on it in pencil

  thanks for the room i leave you the
coup

    i would have sworn it  exclaimed
captain michel you must be a fool  

  wait a minute chaulieu said
again   i haven t finished you can
well imagine what a temper i was in
over this stupid joke which consid-
ering maria-luces condition narrow-
ly escaped being criminal  it
was no use rubbing her she stayed as
cold as ice during the night she was
taken with a high fever and i sent
to soleure for a doctor it was two
days before we were able to leave
those kind peasants
the inn of terror





 t had had enough of switzerland
and we returned to mourillon
the shortest way possible but alas
the good southern sun was not enough
to cure maria-luce she had always
told me that her lungs were not very
strong and from that day on she be-
gan to cough and when at last a few
years later she stopped coughing she
was dead

  dorat coughed at that to show that
he was still very much alive

  listen poor old chaulieu he
said were all sorry but as far as
maria-luces death is concerned it is
a misfortune which might have oc-
curred under entirely different cir-
cumstances after a damp walk in the
woods for example the truth of the
matter as far as your story goes is
that they played a rotten joke on you
thats all

  no chaulieu growled not at
all    the story only begins to be
interesting from now on

  the following year the italian
papers and finally newspapers all
over the world were full of the dis-
appearance of a man and a woman
and that is how we knew that our two
italians had been antonio ferretti
and countess olivia orsino if we had
had any doubts which was impossible
because the resemblance between them
both was perfect we would have been
convinced by this fact that they had
been traced as far as soleure and
there the trail ended

  when maria-luce and i learned
of this we looked at each other in si-
lence and the same terrible thought
struck us both the unfortunate pair
had wanted to make fun of us they
had hidden in a comer of the hall and
after our departure had slipped into
our room where the scheffers had
murdered them in our place

  well what do you say to that
he asked enjoying the astonishment
of his friends not so bad eh
wait   

    remembering all we had seen and
heard in the vault and especially
madame scheffers frenzied illustra-
tion with the goad and pitchfork we
became more and more convinced that
these people had gone from pretense
to actuality  i mean to say they
had carried the reconstruction of the
crimes of the inn of blood to the
finish

   do you remember maria-luce
said to me do you remember how she
stared at the countess here maria-
luce shivered and went on it was
terrifying one might have believed
that the countess was already her
prey chained to the wall like the
pretty little brunette    and that
she was scratching her eyes out with
the pitchfork all poor wretches
the ruffians may have tortured her
too for fifteen days having already
cooked antonio and when i think 
when i think that if it hadnt been
for that trouble over the coupe they
would never have played that trick as
a revenge  it was we who-

   dont think about it i ex-
claimed but the matter could not
rest there maria-luce had night-
mares about it at night and so did i
at last to get rid of the obsession we
did our duty we returned to so-
leure and our first move was to go
directly to the police where we told
the whole story from beginning to
end

 an inquest followed which
brought immediate results all the
details we gave all the incidents just
as they had happened before our eyes
were confirmed    and the schef-
fers did not deny a thing they did
not seem in the least phased by it
and yet there were several questions
which might well have embarrassed
them but scheffer had an answer to
everything

for example when the judge
asked what did the words mon-
sieur chaulieu heard mean which
one shall we begin on he answered

	a king comes riding

the blare of the trumpets
grew louder like a deep gold-
en tide surge like the soft
booming of the evening tides against
the silver beaches of valusia the
throng shouted women flung roses
from the roofs as the rhythmic chim-
ing of silver hoofs came clearer and
the first of the mighty array swung
into view in the broad white street
that curved round the golden-spired
tower of splendor

  first came the trumpeters slim
youths clad in scarlet riding with a
flourish of long slender golden trum-

     

pets nest the bowmen tall men from
the mountains and behind these the
heavily armed footmen their broad
shields clashing in unison their long
spears swaying in perfect rhythm to
their stride behind them came the
mightiest soldiery in all the world
the red slayers horsemen splendid-
ly mounted armed in red from hel-
met to spur proudly they sat their
steeds looking neither to right nor to
left but aware of the shouting for all
that like bronze statues they were
and there was never a waver in the
forest of spears that reared above
them

robert-e

  behind those proud and terrible
ranks came the motley files of the
mercenaries fierce wild-looking war-
riors men of mu and of kaa-u and
of the hills of the east and the isles
of the west they bore spears and
heavy swords and a compact group

that marched somewhat apart were
the bowmen of lemuria then came
the light foot of the nation and more
trumpeters brought up the rear

  a brave sight and a sight which
aroused a fierce thrill in the soul of
kull king of valusia not on the

                                      

some chain had broken in his soul flooding
his mind with a red wave of slaughter-
lust


weird tales

topaz throne at the front of the regal
tower of splendor sat kull but in the
saddle mounted on a great stallion
a true warrior king his mighty arm
swung up in reply to the salutes as
the hosts passed his fierce eyes passed
the gorgeous trumpeters with a cas-
ual glance rested longer on the fol-
lowing soldiery they blazed with a
ferocious light as the red slayers
halted in front of him with a clang
of arms and a rearing of steeds and
tendered him the crown salute they
narrowed slightly as the mercenaries
strode by they saluted no one the
mercenaries they walked with
shoulders flung back eyeing kull
boldly and straightly albeit with a
certain appreciation fierce eyes un-
blinking savage eyes staring from
beneath shaggy manes and heavy
brows

  and kull gave back a like stare
he granted much to brave men and
there were no braver in all the world
not even among the wild tribesmen
who now disowned him but kull
was too much the savage to have any
great love for these there were too
many feuds many were age-old
enemies of kulls nation and though
the name of kull was now a word ac-
cursed among the mountains and val-
leys of his people and though kull
had put them from his mind yet the
old hates the ancient passions still
lingered for kull was no valusian
but an atlantean

  the armies swung out of sight
around the gem-blazing shoulders of
the tower of splendor and kull
reined his stallion about and started
toward the palace at an easy gait dis-
cussing the review with the com-
manders that rode with him using
not many words but saying much

  the army is like a sword said
kull and must not be allowed to
rust  so down the street they rode
and kull gave no heed to any of the
whispers that reached his hearing
from the throngs that still swarmed
the streets

  that is kull see valka but
what a king and what a man look
at his arms his shoulders 

  and an undertone of more sinister
whisperings kull ha accursed
usurper from the pagan isles-
aye shame to valusia that a
barbarian sits on the throne of
kings   

 little did kull heed heavy-
handed had he seized the decaying
throne of ancient valusia and with a
heavier hand did he hold it a man
against a nation

  after the council chamber the
social palace where kull replied to
the formal and laudatory phrases of
the lords and ladies with carefully
hidden grim amusement at such
frivolities then the lords and ladies
took their formal departure and kull
leaned back upon the ermine throne
and contemplated matters of state
until an attendant requested permis-
sion from the great king to speak
and announced an emissary from the
pietish embassy

  kull brought his mind back from
the dim mazes of valusian statecraft
where it had been wandering and
gazed upon the piet with little favor
the man gave back the gaze of the
king without flinching he was a
lean-hipped massive-chested warrior
of middle height dark like all his
race and strongly built from strong
immobile features gazed dauntless
and inscrutable eyes

  the chief of the councilors ka-
nu of the tribe right hand of the
king of pictdom sends greetings and
says there is a throne at the feast
of the rising moon for kull king of
kings lord of lords emperor of valu-
sia  

  good answered kull say to
ka-nu the ancient ambassador of the
western isles that the king of valu-
sia will quaff wine with him when the
moon floats over the hills of zal-
gara  

  still the piet lingered i have a
word for the king not-with a con-
the shadow kingdom



temptuons flirt of his hand-for
these slaves

  kull dismissed the attendants with
a word watching the piet warily

 the man stepped nearer and
lowered his voice come alone to
feast tonight lord king such was
the word of my chief  

  the kings eyes narrowed gleam-
ing like gray sword steel coldly

  alone

  aye

  they eyed each other silently their
mutual tribal enmity seething beneath
their cloak of formality their
mouths spoke the cultured speech the
conventional court phrases of a high-
ly polished race a race not their own
but from their eyes gleamed the
primal traditions of the elemental
savage kull might be the king of
valusia and the piet might be an
emissary to her courts but there in
the throne hall of kings two tribes-
men glowered at each other fierce
and wary while ghosts of wild wars
and world-ancient feuds whispered to
each

  to the king was the advantage and
he enjoyed it to its fullest extent
jaw resting on hand he eyed the
piet who stood like an image of
bronze head flung back eyes un-
flinching

  across kulls lips stole a smile
that was more a sneer

  and so i am to come-alone
civilization had taught him to speak
by innuendo and the piets dark eyes
glittered though he made no reply
how am i to know that you come
from ka-nu

  i have spoken was the sullen
response

 and when did a piet speak
truth sneered kull fully aware
that the piets never lied but using
this means to enrage the man

  i see your plan king the piet
answered imperturbably you wish
to anger me by valka you need go
no further i am angry enough
and i challenge you to meet me in

single battle spear sword or dagger
mounted or afoot are you king or

man

  kulls eyes glinted with the grudg-
ing admiration a warrior must needs
give a bold foeman but he did not
fail to use the chance of further an-
noying his antagonist

  a king does not accept the chal-
lenge of a nameless savage he
sneered nor does the emperor of
valusia break the truce of ambassa-
dors you have leave to go say to
ka-nu i will come alone

  the piets eyes flashed murderous-
ly he fairly shook in the grasp of
the primitive blood-lust then turn-
ing his back squarely upon the king
of valusia he strode across the hall
of society and vanished through the
great door

  again kull leaned back upon the
ermine throne and meditated

  so the chief of the council of piets
wished him to come alone but for
what reason treachery grimly
kull touched the hilt of his great
sword but scarcely the piets val-
ued too greatly the alliance with
valusia to break it for any feudal
reason kull might be a warrior of
atlantis and hereditary enemy of all
piets but too he was king of valusia
the most potent ally of the men of the
west

  kull reflected long upon the strange
state of affairs that made him ally of
ancient foes and foe of ancient
friends he rose and paced restlessly
across the hall with the quick noise-
less tread of a lion chains of friend-
ship tribe and tradition had he bro-
ken to satisfy his ambition and by
valka god of the sea and the land
he had realized that ambition he
was king of valusia-a fading degen-
erate valusia a valusia living mostly
in dreams of bygone glory but still a
mighty land and the greatest of the
seven empires valusia-land of
dreams the tribesmen named it and
sometimes it seemed to kull that he
moved in a dream strange to him


weird tales

were the intrigues of court and pal-
ace army and people all was like a
masquerade where men and women
hid their real thoughts with a smooth
mask yet the seizing of the throne
had been easy-a bold snatching of
opportunity the swift whirl of
swords the slaying of a tyrant of
whom men had wearied unto death
short crafty plotting with ambitious
statesmen out of favor at court-and
kull wandering adventurer at-
lantean exile had swept up to the
dizzy heights of his dreams he was
lord of valusia king of kings yet
now it seemed that the seizing was far
easier than the keeping the sight of
the piet had brought back youthful
associations to his mind the free
wild savagery of his boyhood and
now a strange feeling of dim unrest
of unreality stole over him as of late
it had been doing who was he a
straightforward man of the seas and
the mountain to rule a race strangely
and terribly wise with the mysticisms
of antiquity an ancient race--
i am kull said he flinging
back his head as a lion flings back his
mane i am kull

  his falcon gaze swept the ancient
hall his self-confidence flowed
back    and in a dim nook of the
hall a tapestry moved-slightly

  	thus spake the silent halls
             of valusia

the moon had not risen and the
garden was lighted with torches
aglow in silver cressets when kull sat
down in the throne before the table
of ka-nu ambassador of the western
isles at his right hand sat the
ancient piet as much unlike an emis-
sary of that fierce race as a man could
be ancient was ka-nu and wise in
statecraft grown old in the game
there was no elemental hatred in the
eyes that looked at kull appraisingly
no tribal traditions hindered his
judgments long associations with

the statesmen of the civilized nations
had swept away such cobwebs not
who and what is this man was the
question ever foremost in ka-nus
mind but can i use this man and
how tribal prejudices he used only
to further his own schemes

  and kull watched ka-nu answer-
ing his conversation briefly wonder-
ing if civilization would make of him
a thing like the piet for ka-nu was
soft and paunchy many years had
stridden across the sky-rim since ka-
nu had wielded a sword true he
was old but kull had seen men older
than he in the forefront of battle
the piets were a long-lived race a
beautiful girl stood at ka-nus elbow
refilling his goblet and she was kept
busy meanwhile ka-nu kept up a
running fire of jests and comments
and kull secretly contemptuous of
his garrulity nevertheless missed
none of his shrewd humor

  at the banquet were pictish chiefs
and statesmen the latter jovial and
easy in their manner the warriors
formally courteous but plainly ham-
pered by their tribal affinities yet
kull with a tinge of envy was cog-
nizant of the freedom and ease of the
affair as contrasted with like affairs of
the valusian court such freedom
prevailed in the rude camps of at-
lantis-kull shrugged his shoulders
after all doubtless ka-nu who had
seemed to have forgotten he was a
piet as far as time-hoary custom and
prejudice went was right and he
kull would better become a valusian
in mind as in name

  at last when the moon had reached
her zenith ka-nu having eaten and
drunk as much as any three men
there leaned back upon his divan
with a comfortable sigh and said
now get you gone friends for the
king and i would converse on such
matters as concerns not children
yes you too my pretty yet first let
me kiss those ruby lips-so now
dance away my rose-bloom
the shadow kingdom



  ka-nus eyes twinkled above his
white beard as he surveyed kull who
sat erect grim and uncompromising

  you are thinking kull said the
old statesman suddenly that ka-nu
is a useless old reprobate fit for noth-
ing except to guzzle wine and kiss
wenches

  in fact this remark was so much in
line with his actual thoughts and so
plainly put that kull was rather
startled though he gave no sign

  ka-nu gurgled and his paunch shook
with his mirth wine is red and
women are soft he remarked toler-
antly   but-ha ha-think not old
ka-nu allows either to interfere with
business

  again he laughed and kull moved
restlessly this seemed much like
being made sport of and the kings
scintillant eyes began to glow with
a feline light

  ka-nu reached for the wine-pitcher
filled his beaker and glanced question-
ingly at kull who shook his head
irritably

  aye said ka-nu equably it
takes an old head to stand strong
drink i am growing old kull so
why should you young men begrudge
me such pleasures as we oldsters must
find ah me i grow ancient and
withered friendless and cheerless  
but his looks and expressions
failed far of bearing out his words
his rubicund countenance fairly
glowed and his eyes sparkled so that
his white beard seemed incongruous
indeed he looked remarkably elfin
reflected kull who felt vaguely re-
sentful the old scoundrel had lost
all of the primitive virtues of his race
and of kulls race yet he seemed
more pleased in his aged days than
otherwise

    hark ye kull   said ka-nu rais-
ing an admonitory finger  tis a
chancy thing to laud a young man
yet i must speak my true thoughts
to gain your confidence

  if you think to gain it by flat-
tery-

  tush who spake of flattery i
flatter only to disguard

  there was a keen sparkle in ka-
nus eyes a cold glimmer that did
not match his lazy smile he knew
men and he knew that to gain his end
he must smite straight with this tiger-
ish barbarian who like a wolf scent-
ing a snare would scent out unerring-
ly any falseness in the skein of his
word-web

  you have power kull said he
choosing his words with more care
than he did in the council rooms of
the nation to make yourself mighti-
est of all kings and restore some of
the lost glories of valusia so i care
little for valusia-though the women
and wine be excellent-save for the
fact that the stronger valusia is the
stronger is the piet nation more
with an atlantean on the throne
eventually atlantis will become

united-

  kull laughed in harsh mockery
ka-nu had touched an old wound

  atlantis made my name accursed
when i went to seek fame and for-
tune among the cities of the world
we-they-are age-old foes of the
seven empires greater foes of the
allies of the empires as you should
know

  ka-nu tugged his beard and smiled
enigmatically

  nay nay let it pass but i
know whereof i speak and then
warfare will cease wherein there is
no gain i see a world of peace and
prosperity-man loving his fellow
man-the good supreme all this can
you accomplish-if you livei

    ha   kulls lean hand closed on
his hilt and he half rose with a sud-
den movement of such dynamic speed
that ka-nu who fancied men as some
men fancy blooded horses felt his old
blood leap with a sudden thrill
valka what a warrior nerves and
sinews of steel and fire bound to-
gether with the perfect co-ordination
the fighting instinct that makes the
terrible warrior


weird tales

  but none of ka-nus enthusiasm
showed in his mildly sarcastic tone

  tush be seated look about
you the gardens are deserted the
seats empty save for ourselves you
fear not me

  kull sank back gazing about him
warily

  there speaks the savage mused
ka-nu think you if i planned
treachery i would enact it here where
suspicion would be sure to fall upon
me tut you young tribesmen have
much to learn there were my chiefs
who were not at ease because you were
born among the hills of atlantis and
you despise me in your secret mind
because i am a piet tush i see you
as kull king of valusia not as kull
the reckless atlantean leader of the
raiders who harried the western isles
so you should see in me not a piet
but an international man a figure of
the world now to that figure hark
if you were slain tomorrow who
would be king

  kaanuub baron of blaal

    even so i object to kaanuub for
many reasons yet most of all for the
fact that he is but a figurehead
how so he was my greatest op-
ponent but i did not know that he
championed any cause but his own
the night can hear answered
ka-nu obliquely there are worlds
within worlds but you may trust me
and you may trust brule the spear-
slayer look he drew from his
robes a bracelet of gold representing
a winged dragon coiled thrice with
three horns of ruby on the head

  examine it closely brule will
wear it on his arm when he comes to
you tomorrow night so that you may
know him trust brule as you trust
yourself and do what he tells you to
and in proof of trust look ye 

  and with the speed of a striking
hawk the ancient snatched something
from his robes something that flung
a weird green light over them and
which he replaced in an instant

  the stolen gem exclaimed kull

recoiling the green jewel from
the temple of the serpent valka
you and why do you show it to
me

  to save your life to prove my
trust if i betray your trust deal
with me likewise you hold my life
in your hand now i could not be
false to you if i would for a word
from you would be my doom

  yet for all his words the old scoun-
drel beamed merrily and seemed vast-
ly pleased with himself

    but why do you give me this hold
over you asked kull becoming
more bewildered each second

  as i told you now you see that
i do not intend to deal you false and
tomorrow night when brule comes to
you you will follow his advice with-
out fear of treachery enough an
escort waits outside to ride to the pal-
ace with you lord

  kull rose but you have told me
nothing  

 tush how impatient are
youths ka-nu looked more like a
mischievous elf than ever go you
and dream of thrones and power and
kingdoms while i dream of wine and
soft women and roses and fortune
ride with you king kull  

  as he left the garden kull glanced
back to see ka-nu still reclining lazi-
ly in his seat a merry ancient beam-
ing on all the world with jovial fel-
lowship

amounted warrior waited for the
king just without the garden and
kull was slightly surprized to see
that it was the same that had brought
ka-nus invitation no word was
spoken as kull swung into the saddle
nor as they clattered along the empty
streets

  the color and the gayety of the day
had given away to the eery stillness
of night the citys antiquity was
more than ever apparent beneath the
bent silver moon the huge pillars
of the mansions and palaces towered
up into the stars the broad stair-
the shadow kingdom



ways silent and deserted seemed to
climb endlessly until they vanished in
the shadowy darkness of the upper
realms stairs to the stars thought
kull his imaginative mind inspired
by the weird grandeur of the scene

  clang clang clang sounded the
silver hoofs on the broad moon-flood-
ed streets but otherwise there was no
sound the age of the city its incred-
ible antiquity was almost oppressive
to the king  it was as if the great si-
lent buildings laughed at him noise-
lessly with unguessable mockery and
what secrets did they hold

  you are young said the palaces
and the temples and the shrines but
we are old the world was wild with
youth when we were reared you and
your tribe shall pass but we are in-
vincible indestructible we towered
above a strange world ere atlantis
and lemuria rose from the sea we
still shall reign when the green wa-
ters sigh for many a restless fathom
above the spires of lemuria and the
hills of atlantis and when the isles of
the western men are the mountains
of a strange land

    how many kings have we watchcd
ride down these streets before kull of
atlantis was even a dream in the
mind of ka bird of creation ride
on kull of atlantis greater shall
follow you greater came before you
they are dust they are forgotten we
stand we know we are ride ride
on kull of atlantis kull the king
kull the fool

  and it seemed to kull that the
clashing hoofs took up the silent re-
frain to beat it into the night with
hollow re-echoing mockery

  kull - the - king kull - the
- fool

  glow moon you light a kings
way gleam stars you are torches
in the train of an emperor and
clang silver-shod hoofs you herald
that kull rides through valusia

  ho awake valusia it is kull
that rides kull the king

 we have known many kings
said the silent halls of valusia

  and so in a brooding mood kull
came to the palace where his body-
guard men of the red slayers came
to take the rein of the great stallion
and escort kull to his rest there the
piet still sullenly speechless wheeled
his steed with a savage wrench of the
rein and fled away in the dark like a
phantom kulls heightened imagina-
tion pictured him speeding through
the silent streets like a goblin out of
the elder world

  there was no sleep for kull that
night for it was nearly dawn and he
spent the rest of the night hours pac-
ing the throneroom and pondering
over what had passed ka-nu had
told him nothing yet he had put him-
self in kulls complete power at
what had he hinted when he had said
the baron of blaal was naught but a
figurehead and who was this brule
who was to come to him by night
wearing the mystic armlet of the
dragon and why above all why had
ka-nu shown him the green gem of
terror stolen long ago from the tem-
ple of the serpent for which the
world would rock in wars were it
known to the weird and terrible keep-
ers of that temple and from whose
vengeance not even ka-nus ferocious
tribesmen might be able to save him
but ka-nu knew he was safe reflect-
ed kull for the statesman was too
shrewd to expose himself to risk with-
out profit but was it to throw the
king off his guard and pave the way to
treachery would ka-nu dare let
him live now kull shrugged his
shoulders

	they that walk the night

the moon had not risen when kull
hand to hilt stepped to a window
the windows opened upon the great
inner gardens of the royal palace and
the breezes of the night bearing the
scents of spice trees blew the filmy
curtains about the king looked out


weird tales

the walks and groves were deserted
carefully trimmed trees were bulky
shadows fountains near by flung their
slender sheen of silver in the starlight
and distant fountains rippled steadily
no guards walked those gardens for
so closely were the outer walls guard-
ed that it seemed impossible for any
invader to gain access to them

  vines curled up the walls of the
palace and even as kull mused upon
the ease with which they might be
climbed a segment of shadow de-
tached itself from the darkness below
the window and a bare brown arm
curved up over the sill kulfs great
sword hissed half-way from the
sheath then the king halted upon
the muscular forearm gleamed the
dragon armlet shown him by ka-nu
the night before

  the possessor of the arm pulled
himself up over the sill and into the
room with the swift easy motion of a
climbing leopard

  you are brule asked kull and
then stopped in surprize not unmin-
gled with annoyance and suspicion
for the man was he whom kull had
taunted in the hall of society the
same who had escorted him from the
pictish embassy

  i am brule the spear-slayer  an-
swered the piet in a guarded voice
then swiftly gazing closely in kulls
face he said barely above a whisper

  	ila nama kaa lajerama

  kull started ha what mean
you

  know you not

  nay the words are unfamiliar
they are of no language i ever heard
-and yet by valka-somewhere-

i have heard-

  aye was the piets only com-
ment his eyes swept the room the
study room of the palace except for
a few tables a divan or two and
great shelves of books of parchment
the room was barren compared to the
grandeur of the rest of the palace

  tell me king who guards the
door

    eighteen of the red slayers but
how -come you stealing through the
gardens by night and scaling the walls
of the palace

  brule sneered   the guards of va-
lusia are blind buffaloes i could steal
their girls from under their noses i
stole amid them and they saw me not
nor heard me and the walls-i could
scale them without the aid of vines
i have hunted tigers on the foggy
beaches when the sharp east breezes
blew the mist in from seaward and i
have climbed the steeps of the western
sea mountain but come-nay touch
this armlet

  he held out his arm and as kull
complied wonderingly gave an appar-
ent sigh of relief

  bo now throw off those kingly
robes for there are ahead of you this
night such deeds as no atlantean ever
dreamed of

  brule himself was clad only in a
scanty loin-cloth through which was
thrust a short curved sword

  and who are you to give me or-
ders asked kull slightly resentful

  did not ka-nu bid you follow me
in all things asked the piet irri-
tably his eyes flashing momentarily
i have no love for you lord but for
the moment i have put the thought of
feuds from my mind do you like-
wise but come

  walking noiselessly he led the way
across the room to the door a slide
in the door allowed a view of the outer
corridor unseen from without and
the piet bade kull look

 what see you

  naught but the eighteen guards-
men

  the piet nodded motioned kull to
follow him across the room at a
panel in the opposite wall brule
stopped and fumbled there a moment
then with a light movement he
stepped back drawing his sword as
he did so kull gave an exclamation
as the panel swung silently open re-
vealing a dimly lighted passageway
a secret passage swore kull
the shadow kingdom



softly and i knew nothing of it
by valka someone shall dance for
this  

  silence hissed the piet

 brule was standing like a bronze
statue as if straining every nerve for
the slightest sound something about
his attitude made kulls hair prickle
slightly not from fear but from some
eery anticipation then beckoning
brule stepped through the secret
doorway which stood open behind
them the passage was bare but not
dust-covered as should have been the
case with an unused secret corridor
a vague gray light filtered through
somewhere but the source of it was
not apparent every few feet kull
saw doors invisible as he knew from
the outside but easily apparent from
within

  the palace is a very honeycomb
he muttered

  aye night and day you are
watched king by many eyes

  the king was impressed by brules
manner the piet went forward
slowly warily half crouching blade
held low and thrust forward when
he spoke it was in a whisper and he
continually flung glances yom side to
side

  the corridor turned sharply and
brule warily gazed past the turn

  look he whispered but re-
member no word no sound-on
your life

  kull cautiously gazed past him
the corridor changed just at the bend
to a flight of steps and then kull
recoiled at the foot of those stairs
lay the eighteen red slayers who
were that night stationed to watch the
kings study room brules grip upon
his mighty arm and brules fierce
whisper at his shoulder alone kept
kull from leaping down those stairs

  silent kull silent in valkas
name hissed the piet these cor-
ridors are empty now but i risked
much in showing you that you might
then believe what i had to say back
now to the room of study and he

retraced his steps kull following  his
mind in a turmoil of bewilderment

  this is treachery muttered the
king his steel-gray eyes a-smolder
foul and swift mere minutes have
passed since those men stood at
guard

  again in the room of study brule
carefully closed the secret panel and
motioned kull to look again through
the slit of the outer door kull gasped
audibly for without stood the eight-
een guardsmen

  this is sorcery he whispered
half-drawing his sword do dead
men guard the king

  aye came brules scarcely au-
dible reply there was a strange ex-
pression in the piets scintillant eyes
they looked squarely into each oth-
ers eyes for an instant kulls brow
wrinkled in a puzzled scowl as he
strove to read the piets inscrutable
face then brules lips barely mov-
ing formed the words

the - snake - that - speaks
silent whispered kull laying
his hand over brules mouth that
is death to speak that is a name ac-
cursed

  the piets fearless eyes regarded
him steadily

 look again king kull per-
chance the guard was changed
nay those are the same men in
valkas name this is sorcery-this is
insanity i saw with my own eyes the
bodies of those men not eight minutes
agone yet there they stand

  brule stepped back away from the
door kull mechanically following

  kull what know ye of the tradi-
tions of this race ye rule   

  much-and yet little valusia is

so old-

 aye brules eyes lighted
strangely we are but barbarians-
infants compared to the seven em-
pires not even they themselves know
how old they are neither the memory
of man nor the annals of the histo-
rians reach back far enough to tell us
when the first men came up from the


weird tales

sea and built cities on the shore but
kull men were not always ruled by
men

  the king started their eyes met

  aye there is a legend of my peo-
ple-

 and mine broke in brule
 that was before we of the isles were
allied with valusia aye in the reign
of lion-fang seventh war chief of the
piets so many years ago no man re-
members how many across the sea
we came from the isles of the sunset
skirting the shores of atlantis and
falling upon the beaches of valusia
with fire and sword aye the long
white beaches resounded with the
clash of spears and the night was like
day from the flame of the burning
castles and the king the king of
valusia who died on the red sea

sands that dim day- his voice

trailed off the two stared at each
other neither speaking then each
nodded

  ancient is valusia whispered
kull   the hills of atlantis and mu
were isles of the sea when valusia was
young  

  the night breeze whispered through
the open window not the free crisp
sea air such as brule and kull knew
and reveled in in their land but a
breath like a whisper from the past
laden with musk scents of forgotten
things breathing secrets that were
hoary when the world was young

  the tapestries rustled and sudden-
ly kull felt like a naked child before
the inscrutable wisdom of the mystic
past again the sense of unreality
swept upon him at the back of his
soul stole dim gigantic phantoms
whispering monstrous things he
sensed that brule experienced similar
thoughts the piets eyes were fixed
upon his face with a fierce intensity
their glances met kull felt warmly
a sense of comradeship with this mem-
ber of an enemy tribe like rival
leopards turning at bay against hunt-
ers these two savages made common

cause against the inhuman powers of
antiquity

t rule again led the way back to the
secret door silently they entered
and silently they proceeded down the
dim corridor taking the opposite di-
rection from that in which they had
previously traversed it after a while
the piet stopped and pressed close to
one of the secret doors bidding kull
look with him through the hidden
slot

    this opens upon a little-used stair
which leads to a corridor running past
the study-room door

  they gazed and presently mounting
the stair silently came a silent shape

  tu chief councilor exclaimed
kull by night and with bared
dagger how what means this
brule

  murder and foulest treachery
hissed brule nay-as kull would
have flung the door aside and leaped
forth-we are lost if you meet him
here for more lurk at the foot of those
stairs come  

  half running they darted back
along the passage back through the
secret door brule led shutting it care-
fully behind them then across the
chamber to an opening into a room
seldom used there he swept aside
some tapestries in a dim corner nook
and drawing kull with him stepped
behind them minutes dragged kull
could hear the breeze in the other
room blowing the window curtains
about and it seemed to him like the
murmur of ghosts then through the
door stealthily came tu chief coun-
cilor of the king evidently he had
come through the study room and
finding it empty sought his victim
where he was most likely to be

  he came with upraised dagger
walking silently a moment he halted
gazing about the apparently empty
room which was lighted dimly by a
single candle then he advanced cau-
tiously apparently at a loss to under-
the shadow kingdom



stand the absence of the king he
stood before the hiding place-and-

   	 slay   hissed the piet

  kull with a single mighty leap
hurled himself into the room tu
spun but the blinding tigerish speed
of the attack gave him no chance for
defense or counter-attack sword
steel flashed in the dim light and grat-
ed on bone as tu toppled backward
kulls sword standing out between his
shoulders

  kull leaned above him teeth bared
in the killers snarl heavy brows a-
scowl above eyes that were like the
gray ice of the cold sea then he re-
leased the hilt and recoiled shaken
dizzy the hand of death at his spine

  for as he watched tus face be-
came strangely dim and unreal the
features mingled and merged in a
seemingly impossible manner then
like a fading mask of fog the face
suddenly vanished and in its stead
gaped and leered a monstrous ser-
pents head

  valka gasped kull sweat bead-
ing his forehead and again val-
ka

  brule leaned forward face immo-
bile yet his glittering eyes mirrored
something of kulls horror

  regain your sword lord king
said he there are yet deeds to be
done

  hesitantly kull set his hand to the
hilt his flesh crawled as he set his
foot upon the terror whieh lay at their
feet and as some jerk of muscular re-
action caused the frightful mouth to
gape suddenly he recoiled weak with
nausea then wrathful at himself
he plucked forth his sword and gazed
more closely at the nameless thing
that had been known as tu chief
councilor save for the reptilian
head the thing was the exact coun-
terpart of a man

     a man with the head of a snake  
kull murmured this then is a
priest of the serpent god   

  aye tu sleeps unknowing these

fiends can take any form they will
that is they can by a magic charm
or the like fling a web of sorcery
about their faces as an actor dons a
mask so that they resemble anyone
they wish to  

  then the old legends were true
mused the king the grim old tales
few dare even whisper lest they die
as blasphemers are no fantasies by
valka i had thought-i had guessed
-but it seems beyond the bounds of
reality ha the guardsmen outside

the door-

  they too are snake-men hold
what would you do

  slay them said kull between
his teeth

  strike at the skull if at all said
brule eighteen wait without the
door and perhaps a score more in the
corridors hark ye king ka-nu
learned of this plot his spies have
pierced the inmost fastnesses of the
snake priests and they brought hints
of a plot long ago he discovered the
secret passageways of the palace and
at his command i studied the map
thereof and came here by night to aid
you lest you die as other kings of va-
lusia have died i came alone for the
reason that to send more would have
roused suspicion many could not
steal into the palace as i did some
of the foul conspiracy you have seen
snake-men guard your door and that
one as tu could pass anywhere else
in the palace in the morning if the
priests failed the real guards would
be holding their places again nothing
knowing nothing remembering there
to take the blame if the priests suc-
ceeded but stay you here while i
dispose of this carrion

  so saying the piet shouldered the
frightful thing stolidly and vanished
with it through another secret panel
kull stood alone his mind a-whirl
neophytes of the mighty serpent how
many lurked among his cities how
might he tell the false from the true
aye how many of his trusted coua-


weird tales

cilors his generals were men he
could be eertain-of whom

f i he secret panel swung inward and
   brule entered

  you were swift

  aye the warrior stepped for-
ward eyeing the floor there is
gore upon the rug see   

  kull bent forward  from the corner
of his eye he saw a blur of movement
a glint of steel like a loosened bow
he whipped erect thrusting upward
the warrior sagged upon the sword
his own clattering to the floor even
at that instant kull reflected grimly
that it was appropriate that the trai-
tor should meet his death upon the
sliding upward thrust used so much
by his race then as brule slid from
the sword to sprawl motionless on the
floor the face began to merge and
fade and as kull caught his breath
his hair a-prickle the human features
vanished and there the jaws of a
great snake gaped hideously the ter-
rible beady eyes venomous even in
death

  he was a snake priest all the
time gasped the king valka
what an elaborate plan to throw me
off my guard ka-nu there is he a
man was it ka-nu to whom i talked
in the gardens almighty valka
as his flesh crawled with a horrid
thought are the people of valusia
men or are they all serpents   
undecided he stood idly seeing that
the thing named brule no longer wore
the dragon armlet a sound made
him wheel

  brule was coming through the se-
cret door

 hold upon the arm upthrown
to halt the kings hovering sword
gleamed the dragon armlet  valka  
the piet stopped short then a grim
smile curled his lips

  by the gods of the seas these de-
mons are craity past reckoning for
it must be that that one lurked in the
corridors and seeing me go carrying

the earcass of that other took my ap-
pearance so i have another to do
away with  

  hold there was the menace of
death in kulls voice i have seen
two men turn to serpents before my
eyes how may i know if you are a
true man

  brule laughed for two reasons
king kull no snake-man wears this
-he indicated the dragon armlet-
nor can any say these words and
again kull heard the strange phrase
ka nama km lajerama

  ka nama km lajeramakull re-
peated mechanically   now where in
valkas name have i heard that i
have not and yet-and yet- 

  aye you remember kull said
brule through the dim corridors of
memory those words lurk though you
never heard them in this life yet in
the bygone ages they were so terribly
impressed upon the soul mind that
never dies that they will always strike
dim chords in your memory though
you be reincarnated for a million
years to come for that phrase has
come secretly down the grim and
bloody eons since when uncounted
centuries ago those words were watch-
words for the race of men who bat-
tled with the grisly beings of the el-
der universe for none but a real
man of men may speak them whose
jaws and mouth are shaped different
from any other creature their mean-
ing has been forgotten but not the
words themselves

  true said kull i remember
the legends-valka he stopped
short staring for suddenly like the
silent swinging wide of a mystic door
misty unfathomed reaches opened in
the recesses of his consciousness and
for an instant he seemed to gaze back
through the vastnesses that spanned
life and life seeing through the
vague and ghostly fogs dim shapes re-
living dead centuries-men in combat
with hideous monsters vanquishing a
planet of frightful terrors against
the shadow kingdom



a gray ever-shifting background
moved strange nightmare forms
fantasies of lunacy and fear and
man the jest of the gods the blind
wisdomless striver from dust to dust
following the long bloody trail of his
destiny knowing not why bestial
blundering like a great murderous
child yet feeling somewhere a spark
of divine fire    kull drew a hand
across his brow shaken these sudden
glimpses into the abysses of memory
always startled him

  they are gone said brule as if
scanning his secret mind the bird-
women the harpies the bat-men the
flying fiends the wolf-people the de-
mons the goblins-all save such as
this being that lies at our feet and a
few of the wolf-men long and ter-
rible was the war lasting through the
bloody centuries since first the first
men risen from the mire of apedom
turned upon those who then ruled the
world and at last mankind con-
quered so long ago that naught but
dim legends come to us through the
ages the snake-people were the last
to go yet at last men conquered even
them and drove them forth into the
waste lands of the world there to
mate with true snakes until some day
say the sages the horrid breed shall
vanish utterly yet the things re-
turned in crafty guise as men grew
soft and degenerate forgetting an-
cient wars ah that was a grim and
secret war among the men of the
younger earth stole the frightful
monsters of the elder planet safe-
guarded by their horrid wisdom and
mysticisms taking all forms and
shapes doing deeds of horror secretly
no man knew who was true man and
who false no man could trust any
man yet by means of their own
craft they formed ways by which the
false might be known from the true
men took for a sign and a standard
the figure of the flying dragon the
winged dinosaur a monster of past
ages which was the greatest foe of the

serpent and men used those words
which i spoke to you as a sign and
symbol for as i said none but a true
man can repeat them so mankind
triumphed yet again the fiends came
after the years of forgetfulness had
gone by-for man is still an ape in
that he forgets what is not ever before
his eyes as priests they came and
for that men in their luxury and
might had by then lost faith in the
old religions and worships the snake-
men in the guise of teachers of a new
and truer cult built a monstrous re-
ligion about the worship of the ser-
pent god such is their power that
it is now death to repeat the old leg-
ends of the snake-people and people
bow again to the serpent god in new
foim and blind fools that they are
the great hosts of men see no connec-
tion between this power and the
power men overthrew eons ago as
priests the snake-men are content to
rule-and yet- he stopped

  go on kull felt an unaccount-
able stirring of the short hair at the
base of his scalp

  kings have reigned as true men
in valusia the piet whispered and
yet slain in battle have died serpents
-as died he who fell beneath the
spear of lion-fang on the red beaches
when we of the isles harried the seven
empires and how can this be lord
kull these kings were bom of
women and lived as men this-the
true kings died in secret-as you
would have died tonight-and priests
of the serpent reigned in their stead
no man knowing 

  kull cursed between his teeth
aye it must be no one has ever
seen a priest of the serpent and lived
that is known they live in utmost
secrecy  

  the statecraft of the seven em-
pires is a mazy monstrous thing
said brule   there the true men know
that among them glide the spies of
the serpent and the men who are the
serpents allies-such as kaanuub

baron of blaal-yet no man dares seek
to unmask a suspect lest vengeance
befall him no man trusts his fellow
and the true statesmen dare not speak
to each other what is in the minds of

all then would the power of the ser-

thus far i was prepared from now

take this carcass to the hiding-place
where i took the other being

itull followed the piet with his
grisly burden through the secret
panel and down the dim corridor
their feet trained to the silence of
the wilderness made no noise like
phantoms they glided through the
ghostly light kull wondering that the
corridors should be deserted at every
turn he expected to run full upon
some frightful apparition suspicion
surged back upon him was this piet
leading him into ambush he fell
back a pace or two behind brule his
ready sword hovering at the piets
unheeding back brule should die
first if he meant treachery but if the
piet was aware of the kings suspi-
cion he showed no sign stolidly he
tramped along until they came to a
room dusty and long unused where
moldy tapestries hung heavy brule

drew aside some of these and con-
cealed the corpse behind them

  then they turned to retrace their
steps when suddenly brule halted
with such abruptness that he was
closer to death than he knew for
kulls nerves were on edge

  something moving in the corri-
dor hissed the piet ka-nu said
these ways would be empty yet-

  he drew his sword and stole into
the corridor kull following warily

  a short way down the corridor a
strange vague glow appeared that
came toward them nerves a-leap
they waited backs to the corridor
wall for what they knew not but
kull heard brules breath hiss
through his teeth and was reassured
as to brules loyalty

  the glow merged into a shadowy
form a shape vaguely like a man it
was but misty and illusive like a
wisp of fog that grew more tangible
as it approached but never fully ma-
terial a face looked at them a pair
of luminous great eyes that seemed
to hold all the tortures of a million
centuries there was no menace in
that face with its dim worn features
but only a great pity-and that face
-that face-

  almighty gods breathed kull
an icy hand at his soul eallal king
of valusia who died a thousand years
ago

  brule shrank back as far as he
could his narrow eyes widened in a
blaze of pure horror the sword shak-
ing in his grip unnerved for the first
time that weird night erect and de-
fiant stood kull instinctively holding
his useless sword at the ready flesh
a-crawl hair a-prickle yet still a king
of kings as ready to challenge the
powers of the unknown dead as the
powers of the living

  the phantom came straight on giv-
ing them no heed kull shrank back
as it passed them feeling an icy
breath like a breeze from the arctic
the shadow kingdom



snow straight on went the shape
with slow silent footsteps as if the
chains of all the ages were upon those
vague feet vanishing about a bend of
the corridor

  valka muttered the piet wip-
ing the cold beads from his brow
that was no man that was a
ghost  

    aye   kull shook his head won-
deringly did you not recognize the
face that was eallal who reigned
in valusia a thousand years ago and
who was found hideously murdered in
his throneroom-the room now known
as the accursed room have you not
seen his statue in the fame room of
kings

  yes i remember the tale now
gods kull that is another sign of
the frightful and foul power of the
snake priests-that king was slain by
snake-pcople and thus his soul became
their slave to do their bidding
throughout eternity for the sages
have ever maintained that if a man
is slain by a snake-man his ghost be-
comes their slave

  a shudder shook kulls gigantic
frame valka but what a fate
hark ye-his fingers closed upon
brules sinewy arm like steel-hark
ye if i am wounded unto death by
these foul monsters swear that ye will
smite your sword through my breast
lest my soul be enslaved

  i swear answered brule his
fierce eyes lighting and do ye the
same by me kull

  their strong right hands met in a
silent sealing of their bloody bargain

	masks

 ull sat upon his throne and gazed
broodingly out upon the sea of
faces turned toward him a courtier
wus speaking in evenly modulated
tones but the king scarcely heard him
close by tu chief councilor stood
ready at kulps command and each
time the king looked at him kull

shuddered inwardly the surface of
court life was as the unrippled sur-
face of the sea between tide and tide
to the musing king the affairs of the
night before seemed as a dream un-
til his eyes dropped to the arm of his
throne a brown sinewy hand rested
there upon the wrist of which
gleamed a dragon armlet brule stood
beside his throne and ever the piets
fierce secret whisper brought him
back from the realm of unreality in
which he moved

  no that was no dream that mon-
strous interlude as he sat upon his
throne in the hall of society and
gazed upon the courtiers the ladies
the lords the statesmen he seemed to
see their faces as things of illusion
things unreal existent only as shad-
ows and mockeries of substance al-
ways he had seen their faces as masks
but before he had looked on them
with contemptuous tolerance think-
ing to see beneath the masks shallow
puny souls avaricious lustful deceit-
ful  now there was a grim undertone
a sinister meaning a vague horror
that lurked beneath the smooth
masks while he exchanged courtesies
with some nobleman or councilor he
seemed to see the smiling face fade
like smoke and the frightful jaws of a
serpent gaping there how many of
those he looked upon were horrid in-
human monsters plotting his death
beneath the smooth mesmeric illusion
of a human face

  valusia-land of dreams and night-
mares-a kingdom of the shadows
ruled by phantoms who glided back
and forth behind the painted curtains
mocking the futile king who sat upon
the throne-himself a shadow

  and like a comrade shadow brule
stood by his side dark eyes glittering
from immobile face a real man
brule and kull felt his friendship
for the savage become a thing of real-
ity and sensed that brule felt a
friendship for him beyond the mere
necessity of statecraft


weird tales

  and wliat mused kull were the
realities of life ambition power
pride the friendship of man the
love of women-which kull had never
known-battle plunder what was
it the real kull who sat upon the
throne or was it the real kull who
had sealed the hills of atlantis har-
ried the far isles of the sunset and
laughed upon the green roaring tides
of the atlantean sea how could a
man be so many different men in a
lifetime for kull knew that there
were many kulls and he wondered
which was the real kull after all
the priests of the serpent merely went
a step further in their magic for all
men wore masks and many a different
mask with each different man or wom-
an and kull wondered if a serpent
did not lurk under every mask

  so he sat and brooded in strange
mazy thought ways and the courtiers
came and went and the minor affairs
of the day were completed until at
last the king and brule sat alone in
the hall of society save for the
drowsy attendants

  kull felt a weariness neither he
nor brule had slept the night before
nor had kull slept the night before
that when in the gardens of ka-nu
he had had his first hint of the weird
things to be last night nothing fur-
ther had occurred after they had re-
turned to the study room from the se-
cret corridors but they had neither
dared nor cared to sleep kull with
the incredible vitality of a wolf had
aforetime gone for days upon days
without sleep in his wild savage days
but now his mind was edged from con-
stant thinking and from the nerve-
breaking eeriness of the past night
he needed sleep but sleep was fur-
thest from his mind

  and he would not have dared sleep
if he had thought of it another thing
that had shaken him was the fact that
though he and brule had kept a close
watch to see if or when the study-
room guard was changed yet it was

changed without their knowledge for
the next morning those who stood on
guard were able to repeat the magic
words of brule but they remembered
nothing out of the ordinary they
thought that they had stood at guard
all night as usual and kull said noth-
ing to the contrary he believed them
true men but brule had advised ab-
solute secrecy and kull also thought
it best

  now brule leaned over the throne
lowering his voice so not even a lazy
attendant could hear they will
strike soon i think kull a while
ago ka-nu gave me a secret sign the
priests know that we know of their
plot of course but they know not how
much we know we must be ready
for any sort of action ka-nu and the
pictish chiefs will remain within hail-
ing distance now until this is settled
one way or another ha kull if it
comes to a pitched battle the streets
and the castles of valusia will run
red

 kull smiled grimly he would
greet any sort of action with a fero-
cious joy this wandering hi a laby-
rinth of illusion and magic was ex-
tremely irksome to his nature he
longed for the leap and clang of
swords for the joyous freedom of
battle

  then into the hall of society came
tu again and the rest of the coun-
cilors

  lord king the hour of the council
is at hand and we stand ready to es-
cort you to the council room

xt ull rose and the councilors bent
the knee as he passed through
the way opened by them for his pas-
sage rising behind him and following
eyebrows were raised as the piet
strode defiantly behind the king but
no one dissented brules challenging
gaze swept the smooth faces of the
councilors with the defiance of an in-
truding savage

the group passed through the halls

                       with a noise between a cougii and a snarl the
                       leopard collapsed

bruce falkner of the k
a r surveyed a group engaged
in the sundown occupation of
talk with drinks at the end of the club
veranda there was no mistaking the
broad back of the district police com-
missioner-known to his intimates as
the policeman-flanked as usual
by the rotund figure of fatty gor-
don and the thin one of the airman
a trio of unfailing gayety but to-
night there was something repellent
about the east coast and all its
works and of course they would talk
of nothing else falkner was about to
pass on but already they had seen
him or to be precise gordon had

     hullo bruce   he called   you re
the very man we want

  falkner hesitated to anyone else
he would have made an excuse but he
liked gordon who in spite of his bulk
was a good sportsman and very effi-
cient at his job which job was
cloves besides gordon had
worked with g p

  come on insisted the others
we wont talk shop

  falkner smiled unbelievingly but
moved toward them if thats a
promise he said ill bet drinks all
round that it will be broken within
the next ten minutes

   as a matter of fact we were right

                                   


weird tales

away from africa remarked the air-
man fatty tried to start about his
precious island but we sat on him
mercilessly  

  what do you think they wanted
to talk about asked gordon in an
aggrieved tone

  no idea said falkner

  a rotten film our highbrow air-
man dragged me to in london when
we were on leave hes mad about it
wild animals in burma or siam with
a few natives running about-the
whole thing faked of course

    pay no attention to him   laughed
the airman its a unique film and
a perfectly straight one with wonder-
ful pictures of monkeys and bears and
tigers not to speak of a herd of ele-
phants

 it sounds good enough said
falkner but to tell you the truth
when one has lived among wild an-
imals as much as i have they never
seem quite right on the screen
gordon burst out laughing you
infernal old big game hunter never
content away from your beastly jun-
gle now what interested me-

  you couldnt have been inter-
ested interrupted the policeman
there were no pictures of pemba
but gordon was not to be drawn
what interested me he went on
  was the leopard  

  falkner looked at him curiously
why the leopard he asked

    i dont know exactly   gordon re-
plied there was only one picture
of it padding through the long grass
but it made me feel uncomfortable-
reminded me of the tales g p used to
tell he was with me in pemba you
know-agent for binney  pomace
the eastern trading people

  there he goes again exclaimed
the airman in jubilation arrant
shop-and within three minutes
thats three and a third drinks

  i only saw g p once said the
policeman when the laughter had sub-
sided and he seemed a very intel-
ligent sort of fellow

  gordon nodded intelligent i
should think he was-but the wrong
kind of intelligence i lived in the
same bungalow with him so i ought
to know he frightened me some-
times  

  poor old fatty said the air-
man   what did he do  

    things you  never do if you live
to be a thousand retorted gordon
in the first place he could drink a
bottle of whisky most nights and
wake up in the morning as fresh as a
daisy i can see him now standing
outside my mosquito-net at the first
streak of dawn and puffing away at
his pipe with the face of a cherub
while i felt like nothing on earth

  morning in pemba announced
the irrepressible airman but falkner
remained serious what frightened
you   he asked

  gordon finished his drink and
when he spoke there was a change in
his manner  its hard to explain  
he said for one thing although
g p was very young-barely twenty-
four i think-and had only been
three years in the country he seemed
to have forgotten that england ever
existed just like those queer old-
stagers one hears about he was a
bit of a poet too with a way of
describing things that held me spell-
bound nothing very hair-raising
about that you  say but it was only
the beginning he got very keen about
studying the natives those were his
good days with the whisky bottle
beside him and his eyes shining
through the smoke of his old dunhili
he would talk for hours about the dif-
ferent tribes and their languages-
most of which he spoke fluently-and
their customs and witchcraft and
medicine men and as to juju there
was nothing in the whole outfit he
didnt know then there was his habit
of going away for days at a time-
disappearing clean off the map no-
body knew where-and returning
without a word of explanation once
he stayed away a week and came
the speared leopard



back absolutely exhausted thank
goodness ive got it to work at last
was his only remark and when i
asked what he meant he replied  the
charm of invisibility old man it
takes it out of you   

  invisibility echoed the airman

  what nonsense  

  gordon nodded thats what i
tried to think but g p wouldnt let
me he explained how he had made
friends with a witch doctor-done him
a good turn of some sort-and out of
gratitude the fellow had been teach-
ing him magic for months increasing
the dose till at last he knew how to
make people believe they could not see
him of course the natives do per-
form tricks of that sort but g p de-
clared that he had actually been able
to attend a meeting of the most secret
of their sects where discovery would
have meant certain death it may be
all nonsense but it got on my nerves 

    did you ever see him make use of
the magic he had learned asked
falkner

   only once to my knowledge we
had been discussing the native method
of hypnotism and g p declared he
could put a man into a trance as well
as any of them according to him
it was easily done with such weak-
minded people i pointed to a coolie
and he looked at him and began to
concentrate or whatever one calls it
well at first nothing happened but
after a few minutes the man suddenly
flopped down and went fast asleep
nothing i could think of would wake
him and g p refused to give the
show away by doing so himself leave
it to the natives he said so they
fetched the women and one of them
covered the mans face with some
white paste and spat on his eyes till
he came to

  ive seen that said the police-
man at tabora one of my men
went into a trance the others said
he was bewitched and brought cer-
tain women who treated him in ex-
actly the same way its curious

what an important part the women
seem to play

  the airman chuckled that fact
isnt confined to african tribes why

in india i knew a woman-

  oh shut up protested gordon
weve heald about her before this
is a different kind of tale    well
i was going to say that the only
people g p seemed to fear were these
witch women he declared they used
magic far beyond his knowledge and
that some of them possessed the rare
power of dual personality  

  the greatest of all their secrets
said the policeman with growing in-
terest while even the airman grew
grave

  what is dual personality he
asked

  gordon hesitated he did not care
about theories and felt that the dis-
cussion was getting beyond his depth
i was never very clear about it he
said at last g p used to talk by the
hour but he got so excited that i
could hardly follow him it appears
however that some natives-especial-
ly the women i just mentioned-can
turn themselves into animals they
take the form of a leopard for choice
and do a lot of damage among the
livestock of neighboring tribes some-
times they even kill men but more
often women though i dont know
why that should be  

  i think i do said the policeman
you see the women continually go
into the jungle or to the river to fetch
wood and water  

  thats true enough agreed gor-
don but the curious part is that
when the leopard has finished lulling
goats or people or whatever its victims
may be it becomes a woman again
and returns innocently to the village  
this statement avas too much for
the airmans composure cut it out
boy he ordered derisively were
not in the dark ages-even on the east
coast - and anyhow these extraor-
dinary tales never seem to get beyond
hearsay now i want to see


weird tales

  the policeman raised his hand in
protest yon never do that up in
the clouds he declared in africa
you must walk on your fiat feet if you
want to see go on gordon 
theres nothing more to tell
said gordon but you must see that
the whole thing got on my nerves if
not try a few months in pemba with
a man who practises magic all day
and drinks whisky all night the
marvel was that in spite of every-
thing g p never neglected his firms
business ill give him full marks for
that though in other respects things
were growing worse when i came
away his one idea was to find a
leopard woman and learn her secret
and he talked of nagomba in the wild
country this side of tanganyika as
the place to try if ever he gets there
youll hear something sensational by
the way does anybody know where
g p is now

  during the discussion falkner
had remained silent magic witch-
craft in the tropics the border-line
between reality and fantasy grew
blurred more easily than most people
cared to admit and it was a bad busi-
ness when a white man crossed it he
drew a bundle of letters from his
pocket possibly their contents had
been meant for him alone but to re-
veal them might save other adventur-
ers from disaster

  i can enlighten you as to g ps
whereabouts he said quietly at
the present moment he is on his way
to england

  home exclaimed gordon in sur-
prize thats news i didnt know
you had met g p

  ive known him since he was a
boy replied falkner you men-
tioned nagomba just now well he
wrote these letters from there ill
read them if you like as to being
sensational you must judge for your-
selves but they certainly carry on
gordons story

  there was a murmur of assent and
falkner unfolded the letters- they

start on june th he said and fol-
low each other like a diary

 yvear bruce-this is a god-for-
saken place in other words i
am the only white man within a hun-
dred miles-and my supply of whisky
has gone astray in the jungle pambu
is with me hes my boy a wonder-
ful factotum and absolutely devoted
you will wonder why on earth the
firm sent me here but as a matter of
fact they didnt i came on my own
for reasons - tremendous reasons -
that the firm will certainly fail to
understand gordon used to think me
mad in pemba though he was too de-
cent to say so i wonder what he
would think now  leave is due in a
month but i doubt if ill take it

  p s the whisky has turned up

  july st letters are a rotten
means of communicating ones ideas
but i want you to have these in case
i dont come back for one reason
though i am glad to write you and
gordon can not try to dissuade me as
you would do if you were on the spot
for im determined to discover the
truth about this dual personality-
zoomorphism is its highbrow name-
the power of a human being to take
the form of an animal and return to
human form ive mastered much of
their infernal juju but this is a mys-
tery unfathomed by any white man
think of what it means-for im con-
vinced that it exists-the power of
living the life of the jungle of shar-
ing its joys and dangers why its
simply evolution backward and then
forward doing in an instant what
darwin imagined to need millions of
years cant you see the fascination
of the problem-to know whether an
animal can have a human mind-
whether memories can come back from
the other state

  there are gruesome rumors of
course one makes it essential to
bring a still-born child to life and
when it opens its mouth bite off its
tongue theres black magic for you
the speared leopard



but i do know that women are the
greatest adepts they are called leop-
ard women because that is the form
they generally take but nobody knows
who they are in fact it is taboo even
to discuss the matter

    pambu has just informed me that
the nagos are cannibals periodically
you understand he also said that
there had been no victim for a long
time so i hope they wont take a sud-
den liking to me thank goodness i
can depend on pambu if there is
trouble

   july th there is an important
juju house here or rather its a com-
pound surrounded by a thorn hedge
with a sacred tree and a big hut in
the center none of the nagos dare
approach the place except to bring
gifts to the spirits who are supposed
to inhabit the hut guarded by a hid-
eous old witch doctor and a priestess

  wandering outside the compound
i managed to catch sight of the lady
as she took in some offerings shes
young taller than most of the women
with regular features-rather of the
arab type-and wonderful gray eyes
tinged with yellow ive never seen a
native-or european for that matter
-with such eyes in a moment she
was gone leaving me with a sense of
attraction not physical but some-
thing i cant describe

  though the place often seems de-
serted the witch doctor is always on
the watch hes the most malevolent-
looking creature you can imagine and
very wide awake but i shall find a
way to speak to the priestess what-
ever the risk good old pambu his
announcement of the whiskys arrival
has given me a brain wave tomor-
row an offering of spirits goes to the
spirit of the juju house and then un-
less im much mistaken things will
begin to happen

  july th i can hardly believe
my luck she is sitting in my hut
weaving flowers into her fuzzy hair
and watching intently while i write
her name is ulana which means the

greatest witch so it really looks as if
i were on the right track at last
this is how it happened with a bottle
of whisky under my arm i went to
the sacred compound and struck the
drum hanging at the entrance of
course the chances were against
ulanas appearing alone but she did
and-curiously enough-my presence
seemed to cause her no surprize for
a moment her gaze pierced me through
and through as if searching for some-
thing then she asked very quietly
what it was i needed knowledge
i replied  i have traveled many days
to seek you out 

   the white man wishes to learn
of my wisdom she said it is well
but not here when night falls i will
come 

  the eagerness of her consent
didnt exactly please me after all
she is high priestess in a cannibal vil-
lage and one never knows what
treachery may be afoot so i tried to
explain that there would probably be
trouble if she were seen going to my
hut at that she grew thoughtful and
whispered pointing in the direction
of the juju house all others i can
make blind but against mkulu no
charms avail

  i guessed that mkulu must be
her hideous opposite number and took
my opportunity at a run with a bless-
ing for the man who invented whisky
make mkulu drink this i said
holding up the bottle and for many
hours he also will see nothing  once
more her eyes met mine and the gold
in them danced as she turned away

  of course i realize that for a sol-
itary white man to stand up against
a cannibal witch doctor is a risky
business but so far everything has
worked according to plan and
mkulu is blind to the world tonight
while ulana sits here never speak-
ing and never taking her eyes off
me being watched is usually an un-
pleasant sensation but now i find it
wonderfully soothing and there is
something else-i never saw her come


weird tales

into the hut believe it or not she
made herself invisible to me its all
the more strange because at that mo-
ment i happened to be extra wide
awake with a feeling as if some wild
animal were prowling round the hut
-and then suddenly she was there
its the brink of knowledge the
question is shall i have the courage to
go on

  july th her eyes fascinate me
their yellow glint is like powdered
gold falling through water in bright
light the iris dwindles to a pinpoint-
like a cats-and the smaller it is the
more it holds me after the first visit
she kept away for days but shes here
again this evening and i know now
that she has the power of zoo-
morphism

  ill tell you what happened this
morning the headman asked me to go
out the next night of full moon after
a leopard that has been causing
trouble it has carried off several
goats and killed a girl at the edge of
the jungle and the people are panic-
stricken declaring it to be a leopard
woman you can imagine my feelings
at that bit of news of course i ac-
cepted-it would have been impossible
to do otherwise-though even then i
didnt like the idea of shooting the
leopard

  the headman said that after
watching for two nights in a tree he
had speared the beast but the grass
was very long and it got away with
his spearhead in its left shoulder well
just now i was thinking drowsily
about all these things and watching
ulana curled up at my feet when
suddenly something roused me into
full consciousness she had come in a
sort of mantle of brightly colored
grass cloth which intrigued me be-
cause native women dont wear such
things and as i stared at it the mantle
slipped down showing a great wound
still fresh and bleeding behind her
left shoulder for a moment i was
too much surprized to think then the
headmans story - the tales i had

heard of leopard women-my own
suspicions about ulana-came rush-
ing to my brain filling the blanks like
the last pieces of a jig-saw puzzle

  instinctively i made myself devils
advocate trying to use every argu-
ment against my own conviction
after all the wound might be a knife
wound a priestess must certainly
have enemies or mkulu himself
might have attacked her in a fit of
jealousy but no arguments would
hold this was a spear wound if ever
there was one-a fresh spear wound
in the left shoulder-and the leopard
had been wounded in the left shoulder
-and escaped

   ulana i cried catching her by
the arm  how did this happen  

  she drew away and covered her
shoulder but i had seen enough   
i knew now a thief came in the
night she answered his knife was
sharp 

   a thiefs knife i said say
rather the headmans spear where
were you two nights since  ulana
my idea was to show that i had
guessed her secret but the question
was useless for she only smiled with
her eyes fixed on mine

  i dont know how long we had
been looking at each other in silence-
it seemed an eternity-when suddenly
a deep-toned drum began to beat in
the distance and ulana sprang to her
feet in terror the temple drum
she whispered mkulu seeks me in
vain  in the forest  i will
come  and before i could speak she
was gone

falkner paused for a moment and
looked up the expression on the
faces round him showed neither con-
viction nor disbelief but rather an ex-
pectant tolerance of the adventure of
 p and his leopard woman in
europe these would be considered the
fantastic product of a mind unbal-
anced by climate drink and over-
study of the occult-with stress upon
the second reason-but in africa
the speared leopard



people learn to respect what they can
not understand and so three english-
men sat silent while falkner took up
the last of the letters

  this one has no date he said
but it was written the evening be-
fore i reached nagomba that is to say
on the th of july

  the th exclaimed the air-
man why i flew over the place
that very afternoon a good deal lower
than was safe too with nowhere to
land within fifty miles there was a
great fuss going on one of those big
ceremonial dances - yoii know the
kind of thing-an endless chain of
men painted white and women with
grass kilts like ballet skirts twisting
and turning in a mad sort of follow-
the-leader you must have been quite
near

  i wasnt far away said falk-
ner fortunately    but youll
hear about that presently first listen
to g ps letter

  he resumed leading

  im making an effort to put every-
thing on paper before-well while i
can last night was full moon and
i went into the forest with the head-
man and several others-and of course
pambu as we left the big drum in
the juju compound began to boom
slowly just as it did on the night
when ulana was here-just as it is
doing now will nothing stop the
cursed thing i think ill go mad
with its measured thud hammering
into my brain mad why dont
they try that drum in america it
would be a splendid idea for the third
degree   

  we went on and on-i dont know
how far - till at last the headman
stopped at the edge of a curved open
space surrounded by dense under-
growth and helped me up into the
last tree of a group that stuck out
from the rest like a cape there was
a platform among the branches just
big enough for me and my rifle and
so placed that it lay in shadow with
bright moonlight on three sides i

wanted to keep pambu but the head-
man said it was the custom to watch
alone so i didnt insist then they
all went away leaving me with only
the faint drum beats-you know what
a distance they carry-for company

  suddenly the drum beats stopped
at first the silence seemed a relief
like a weight lifted from my brain
but soon i began to realize that silence
in the jungle is far worse than any
drumming of course i had read
about it and been told how awful it
was but no description could come
anywhere near the horror of reality
with its dead emptiness working on
every nerve through what seemed
ages of torture my only thought was
of ulana would she come as she
had promised would a leopard
come-a leopard with a spear wound
in its shoulder in spite of all that
had happened the thing seemed in-
credible yet something told me that
it was true and that my own strength
of mind-my absolute belief-must
prove it

  with throbbing brain i watched
the moon move slowly across the open
glade touching new places with
shafts of light that pierced the wall
of foliage till at last from a spot of
darkness no moonbeam could pen-
etrate two eyes like great burning
opals looked out mechanically i
grasped my rifle and as i did so the
brightness of the eyes faded and a
big leopard moved into the open

  after that things happened so
quickly that much is blotted out of
my memory i remember standing on
the ground beneath the tree while the
leopard came nearer and nearer
watching me with its yellow eyes-
ulanas eyes i hadnt got my rifle
-it must have been left in the tree-
and somehow i didnt care it was as
if my mind had ceased to work leav-
ing my body incapable of movement
or fear or any sensation but when
the beast was almost within reach an
irresistible impulse arose in me to feel
its shoulder for the spear wound and


weird tales

prove that ulana had kept her word
for of course the leopard was ulana
how otherwise could i be standing
there unharmed to need further
proof seemed shameful but i simply
had to do it-want of faith-the old
story and now the games up-for
my hands were stretched out and had
almost touched the silky coat when
suddenly mkulu ran out of the un-
dergrowth and stood with his hunting-
spear poised to throw

  like a fool i raised my arm to
stop him thinking that he wanted to
save me from the leopard but i paid
the price of my foolishness for in a
second the shining spearhead had
made a silver streak against the black
wall of trees and buried itself in my
side while the shaft quivered and
then dropped tearing the twisted
barbs upward in a great gash-like
the one on ulanas shoulder-like-
well its no good worrying-i  never
know now perhaps-if i had kept
my rifle-but as a matter of fact i
would never have used it for at the
very moment the spear struck me the
leopard sprang at mkulu and his
scream of terror rang in my ears as i
fainted

  im not delirious but everything
is all muzzy-from my wound i sup-
pose oh hell take that drum-and
the stamping of the dancers they
have been at it all the afternoon com-
ing closer each time they pass round
the hut i know what that means-
youll never get this letter-but i
must go on with it all the same

  pambu has disappeared i havent
seen him for hours goodness knows
how he got me back here but he did
for when i woke up he was squatting
by my bed and now even he is gone
-a rotten show for i trusted pambu
perhaps theyve done him in as a
sort of hors doeuvre-pleasant idea

  something keeps prowling about
outside it makes no sound but i
know its there bruce old man this
is the end when the thing comes im
going to write down-

falkner folded up the letters and
replaced them in his pocket
thats the end he said so far as
g ps story is concerned now for
mine

  pambu reached my camp on the
evening of the th in a state of ab-
ject fear jabbering away incoherent-
ly and i think on purpose for as
soon as my nayassas and wanyam-
wesis had been sent out of earshot he
suddenly calmed down and said that
the nagos were going to kill his mas-
ter next morning then he shut up
like an oyster and neither threats nor
promises could get another word out
of him poor pambu as it turned
out he had good reason to be afraid
but i only realized that to reach g p
in time i must be quick

  twelve miles through jungle at
night takes some going but just be-
fore dawn we were outside the village
for nearly two hours the drum had
been throbbing in the distance and i
agree with every word g p says
about it that particular beat i dis-
covered afterward is only used on
occasions of human sacrifice but even
without that knowledge its effect on
my nerves in the hot darkness was de-
cidedly unpleasant

  the huts at the edge of the jun-
gle appeared to be deserted and fear-
ing the worst we hurried on to the
big open space in the center of the
village where a silent crowd-the
same white-painted man and grass-
skirted woman the airman told us
about just now with the addition of
a group of witch doctors with hideous
masks-squatted on the ground with
their backs to us glistening like silver
in the twilight beyond them a semi-
circle remained empty in front of one
of the huts to which pambu who had
never left my side for an instant
pointed excitedly i didnt need to be
told that the hut was g ps and
from the appearance of the erowd he
was probably still inside it

  the next few seconds were like a
football scrum i had just given the
the speared leopard



order to get round and occupy the
hut from behind when the sun rose
and with it every man in nagomba
brandishing their spears the white-
painted warriors rushed forward
while the witch doctors yelled like
fury to the accompaniment of drum-
ming that had doubled time at the
same moment

  to try and reach the back of the
hut now seemed hopeless so we
charged with the rest and-though it
may sound incredible-they were so
intent upon the business in hand that
we were in the front line before they
noticed us and then it didnt matter
for suddenly the whole crowd stopped
dead and a drawn-out gasp rose from
its ranks as a leopard stalked slowly
out of the hut and stood facing us

  i was as much taken aback as
anyone though in my casd fear for
g p soon swamped every other
thought while the witch doctors must
have raged at the probable loss of
their victim however that may be a
shower of spears were on their way
when i fired but luckily my bullet
got there first-through the neck and
lung-a dead shot with a noise be-
tween a cough and a snarl the leopard
collapsed lay absolutely still for per-
haps ten seconds and then to my in-
tense amazement rose with a supreme
effort and disappeared in the door-
way of the hut ordering my askaris
to keep the crowd back at all costs i
dashed after it expecting-goodness
knows what i expected but it certain-
ly was not the sight that met my eyes

  g p sprawled on a camp bed
against the further wall and
stretched on the floor beside him head
between paws like a great dog guard-
ing its master lay the leopard so
extraordinary was its position that i
moved forward with caution but it
was dead right enough at first i
thought g p must be dead too but
found to my relief that he was breath-
ing very faintly with the sweat roil-
ing off him as it does when fever is

going down there was a horrible
wound in his side so inflamed that
poison seemed the only explanation
anyhow it sent me back to the door-
way shouting for my medicine chest

  then came the second shock of
that eventful morning with the ex-
ception of my men not a soul was to
be seen the crowd had vanished and
the drum had ceased beating leaving
the place deserted and silent with
something in its steamy emptiness that
made me want to get out of it quick

  an askari came with my things
and as he put them on g p s table i
caught sight of the letters youve
heard what he wrote so you can
imagine my feelings with him lying
there unconscious and his leopard-
or was it his leopard woman -taking
her last guard at his feet the whole
thing seemed a mad brainstorm and
yet-

  pulling myself together i bent
down and felt the animals left shoul-
der and there was a wound a long
jagged gash-healed over but other-
wise exactly as g p had seen it on
ulanas shoulder it may sound ab-
surd but it was all i could do to con-
quer the fear creeping over me-fear
of the place of the silence of dabbling
in things white men should let alone
action was the only remedy and i
clung to that like a drowning man

  i sent for the headman and told
him that he must produce mkulu
dead or alive he said nothing but
led the way into the forest with four
of my men round him to see that there
was no hanky-panky

  after about two miles we came to
the open glade which i recognized at
once from g ps description his
rifle and cartridges were still on the
platform in the tree and when i had
taken them the headman pointed to
the half-devoured remains of a hid-
eous old black lying at the edge of
the scrub mkulu he said and i
knew that he spoke the truth

   and ulana i asked


weird tales

  instantly every vestige of expres-
sion left the headmans face
ulana he repeated staring at me
stonily ulana died    today   
at sunrise 

  the words were spoken deliber-
ately without the least feeling but
their effect upon me was to revive
every doubt i had tried to stifle you
see i killed the leopard at sunrise-
and g ps letters lay fresh in my
pocket coincidence of course but
mighty strange coincidence for a
moment i wanted to question further
-to try and convince myself that the
man was lying-but what was the
vise the curtain separating black
from white would only become more
impenetrable than ever no i had
to realize that my years of experience
led no farther than g ps daring
and that the mystery of the leopard
woman must remain-for somebody
else to fathom

  the askaris could not understand
why i refused to let them skin the
leopard for me and i dont blame
them for it was a perfect specimen
and beautifully marked anyhow we
left it where it lay

  an hour later i got g p away in
a litter-he was still unconscious-
and had just reached the jungle when
that damned drum started beating
again with frantic yells and shouting
from the juju compound only then
i noticed that pambu was missing
and at once guessed what must have
happened it was a rotten situation
i knew that to go into the village a
second time with my tiny force and
g p on my hands would have been
madness and besides it was too late

  to save the victim the only thing
was to carry on which i did

 of course nothing was ever
proved but from evidence that
reached me afterward im sure the
nagos did get pambu-spirited him
away somehow during my absence
with the headman its curious that
i never missed him nor could any of
my men remember when he had last
been seen poor wretch he saved
g ps life and paid for it with his
own

heak thing  said the policeman
after a pause home is the
only cure for a case like that-a long
spell of home i suppose he didnt
tell you what came into the hut-
after he had stopped writing

  no replied falkner he asked
if i got the letters and in his state of
weakness i thought it best not to ques-
tion further by the way there was
no poison in his wound and i think
i know the reason you see poisoned
meat would have been no good to the
nagos

  the policeman nodded every-
thing seems to have worked to save
g p s life lucky devil  

  yes-if he keeps off juju said
gordon its an extraordinary ad-
venture though to my mind the
evidence about the leopard woman
seems far from conclusive  

  for a moment there was silence
then the man who flies above jungles
-and juju-broke it

  you amaze me fatty he re-
marked profoundly havent you
learned that in africa nothing is eon-
elusive  what about another drink

the cruise upon which the

barked a business of cloaking
the rape of sanctified shrines under
guise of procuring new materials for
the manufacture of brighams beau-
tiful boots had begun in the bath

ing toad squatted in one corner watch-
ing a fat white man stand in a tub
and pour water over his paunch with
an iron dipper which is the method
of bathing for white men in soura-

  captain mcteague accustomed to
the nonchalance of the tropic bom
and exiled toward nudity was whis-
tling cheerily when he sought a bath
and plunged in and out of that oc-
cupied hut pursued by the clanking
iron dipper and searing curses de-
scriptive of his intrusion ancestry
and future later apologetic he met
and talked with the clot lied bather
learned that brigham of bristol want-
ed to hire a schooner and crew to ob-
tain the skins of crocodile cobra and
any other unusual hide that might be
made into footgear for women he
wondered if tanned skin of natives
would turn out well until captain mc-
teague suggested his own hide as a
fitting experiment-after which the
shrine business cropped up casually
because captain mcteague suspected
it from the first for one thing he
had heard of brigham of bristol
w t-

     his senses reeled when
     the ape dropped him

brush ideograms and carved by crafts-

bargains of tourist trade it is very
difficult to escape the mute patient
pursuance of vengeance which is ear-

weird tales

took him for a fool the man was
rich and generous he had reason to
be free with money and at present
the annie laurie was idle the bar-
gain was struck brigham installed
with two beach-comber acquaintances
who had an oxford education and
a large thirst and were diplomatic
enough to flatter the shoe merchant to
their personal aggrandizement and
the annie laurie steamed out with
her deck cluttered with live pigs in
wicker hampers and a crew of brown
men of much the same silent inscru-
tability of countenance but vastly dif-
fering ideas of personal adornment

  two things happened quickly
young dr tai hoong for whom cap-
tain mcteague had vast respect and
a speaking acquaintance had been
hired by brigham and looked after
his health with solicitude deserving a
more worthy object captain mc-
teague was surprized that tai hoong
accepted brighams wages certainly
he did not need money he was re-
garded with respect by chinese sa-
vants and educators with awe by the
rest of his world it was only after
thought given to the matter that cap-
tain mcteague connected the presence
of tai hoong with brighams vague
mention of a shrine of nyeng sen
and a string of jade bells the annie
laurie was not a half-day out when
tai hoong busied himself at the crate
of wicker-encased pigs seeking for one
whose squeal never ceased captain
mcteague looked curiously on as a
noted chinese savant set the broken
leg of a young porker that had been
injured in packing and was destined
anyway to be served on the mess
table

  so thats the sort of man you
are said captain mcteague heart-
ily and dr tai hoongs smile was
rarely pleasant at the implied com-
pliment from a broad-beamed rugged
sea-adventurer whose fame on sea
rims of such singing names as java
flores banda arapura molucca
and celebes was as far-reaching as the

scholastic notability of tai hoong
in other strata of life

  the next enlightening moment of
captain mcteague came when they
plowed that dark stretch of sea which
he mentioned as the location of the
little paternosters and tai hoong
began softly to repeat in excellent
english the cruise of the mary
gloster

by the heel of the paternoster there isnt a
  chance to mistake

 and captain mcteague listened
with a feeling of rare enjoyment and
his spine seemed to crinkle when the
modulated voice of tai hoong reached
the close of the poem

churnin chokin chucklin quiet and
  scummy and dark

full to her lower hatches and risin steady
  hark

that was her after bulkhead shes flooded
  from stem to stern

never seen death yet dickie well now
  its your time to learn

  it was a bit uncanny to hear a slant-
eyed yellow - skinned long - queued
chinese recite that britishers paean
with such understanding and in
spite of many cruises hereabouts cap-
tain mcteague had never been able to
shake off a presentiment of evil when
he entered the mysteriously perilous
waters of the macassar

  he was glad of the company of tai
hoong in time for brigham of bris-
tol and his companions drank con-
stantly and bestially and were cor-
respondingly seasick and brutal with
the little brown seamen and kept mc-
teague constantly alert for trouble
also mcteague liked the dignity of
tai hoong in refusing to hold brig-
hams head on occasion and the chi-
nese doctor did not hesitate to tell him
that drink would undoubtedly leave
him a prey to jungle fever fatality

  the malay crew were in vast awe of
tai hoong it was evident they
stepped aside lively when he appeared
on deck showed him a reverence of
demeanor and glance that no white
demon doom of nyeng sen



potentate is granted from these men
of sea-pirate stock even brigham
noticed it and cursed their deference
cursed the white lace jackets they
wore their fantastic millinery and
baggy trousers they constantly spat
betel-juice from mouths like casual-
ties but when the annie laurie ran
into a storm and was driven like a
hunted thing through heaving black
waters the malays shed their bodices
 and pants and without waiting for
commands accomplished the tight-
lashing of everything on board with
incredible speed

    it was a bad storm brigham and
 his friends crept cursingly to their
 berths tai hoong remained on deck
 evidently enjoying the hurricane the
 howling of wind devils between the
 islands but mcteague was alarmed
 for his ship his stout heart sank
 when in spite of seamanship and ex-
 pert piloting in darkness as tangible
 as black wool the annie laurie was
 lifted on a boiling maelstrom and
 dropped on an out-jutting obstacle
 which the violence of the storm had
 uncovered simultaneously with the
 crash came the screech of engines run-
 ning free and jangle of signal bells

     broken propeller   the lips of tai
 hoong shaped mutely

   storm demons shrieked anathemas
 called down murrains on puny hu-
 mans daring to intrude their pallid
 faces in these islands of dark-blooded
 inconquerables the blackness was
 profound the anchors reached no
 ledge of sea-floor to which their flukes
 might cling brigham appeared under
 the cabin light his rain-soaked pa-
 jamas quivering with fat fear until
 mcteague ordered him below and re-
 inforced his command with two ma-
 lays stripped to loin-rags and shining
 oiled skins to shut him in his berth

  a few rags of canvas and a sea-
 anchor were rigged to give steerage
 way with their garments rain-mold-
 ed to their bodies mcteague and tai
 hoong worked with the crew to fight

 the annie laurie off those shores

 r 

where in a sudden lightening of the
torrential downpour a light flickered
the wind had somewhat abated the
gleam on shore waveied up and down
then rested

  im going below for guns doc-
tor said mcteague have you a
reliable shooter and can you use one  

  he was aware that his crew did not
wish to be driven on those shores at
any cost and the sweep of wind and
tide between islands invisible in dark-
ness was carrying them toward that
gleam of light also he was aware
that high cliff walls broke the force of
the wind and battering waves

  as he strapped on big navy re-
volvers captain mcteague saw by the
clock in his berth that it was near
dawn although the storm clouds had
prevented a rift of gray daybreak
showing a screech from the deck took
him aloft three steps at a time to a
scene of confusion on which the deck
lanterns shed lurid stabbing color
splashed on heaving tumult of black
men in frenzied slaughter

  a fusillade of shots warned him
his guns spat as he came from shel-
ter then blackness struck as some-
thing crashed on his skull captain
mcteague felt himself rolling and
bumping then slipping into deeper
darkness than in the storm

when mcteagues eyes opened
tai hoong was bending over
him with abstracted impersonal atten-
tion he sat on the side of the berth to
wrap lengths of white gauze about
the captains wrist mcteague cursed
partly from pain partly in recalling
the fight on deck and his own elim-
ination in the first of the fray

  natives boarded us explained
tai hoong for loot they took all
that was not fastened then they
tried to cut the steam pipes your
steam pressure captain mcteague
was excellent if you had seen how
they were cooked alive it would have
repaid you for your hand not even
a savage can fight steam


weird tales

 what happened to my hand

 they wanted an ornament on
one finger and took it with the hand
i selected the shapeliest hand i
could find but of course it will not
match your own hand in a month
you should have a serviceable substi-
tute for the hand you lost and you
will observe later that your new hand
belonged to a personage of importance
whose body the remaining malays
viewed with marked respect

 meteague swallowed hard and
through gritting teeth remarked a
papuan chieftain welded on that
ring red-hot and because i didnt
squeal i was saved from a new guinea
cooking-pot  

  then his eyes closed more nause-
ating than ether fumes was the
thought of wearing a natives hand in
place of his own he wanted to tear
it off but tai hoong gave him no op-
portunity he was in attendance
night and day and later assisted cap-
tain meteague on deck to take com-
mand

  the annie laurie was beached on
a sheltered shore and her crew were
working on repairs to her hull news
of the shipwreck had traveled and
natives came looking for trade and
straightway caught the interest of
brigham and his two drunken cronies
captain meteague paid no attention
to brigham those days it was not
until the schooner was repaired and
they were ready to set out under can-
vas since there was no way of weld-
ing a propeller shaft in the jungle
that brigham revealed what kept him
sober interested and busy during
those weeks along shore

  the man was boastful blatant sick-
ingly proud of the number of human
skins nicely cured pliant and soft as
doeskins at sight of them meteague
swore large words but tai hoong
was interested even to the point of
drawing brigham out on the source of
supply

  native woman announced brig-
ham and as nice a color now as

when i saw her running into the
jungle he halted abruptly aware
that it was impolitic to confide the de-
tails of his selection and bargaining to
anyone tai hoongs shapely hands
stroked the skin softly his eyes did
not lift not so much as a flicker of
more than casual interest was be-
trayed

  leather like fur must be taken
from prime animals said brigham
  there ought to be a market for this
stuff seems to me i heard of some
woman making her will that her skin
was to be cured to make the cover of
a book of poems her lover had written
to her nice little sentiment that
though a chinaman wouldnt appre-
ciate the delicacy of it  

  no possibly not agreed tai
hoong the skin is fine of texture
finer than this one for instance   he
held up a second horridly suggestive
dark skin

  	 huge giant of a fellow that one-
fought like a tiger before they slugged
him did no end of damage but
they got even   and brigham smiled
flayed him alive its a wonder you
didnt hear him yell

  tai hoong straightened and rolled
a brown paper cigarette deftly his
nostrils emitted streams of smoke
then he strode forward to where cap-
tain meteague bent over charts and
studied a neat sum of figures

    i should be glad to confide in you
captain meteague that my reason
for coming with you and mr brigham
of bristol was not alone the very high
salary he paid me  

  it isnt news to me agreed cap-
tain meteague

  you know of course that mr
brigham has set his mind on visiting
the shrine at nyeng sen i am in-
terested enough to see that this goal
is attempted at least and perhaps
i could assist you in finding it
meteague studied the face of tai
hoong

 something happened he an-
nounced   i had an idea you were on
demon doom op nyeng sen



board to prevent that booze-soaked
fat-head from getting to the shrine
now youve changed your mind id
like to know why  

  the ring on that hand which my
poor surgery gave you captain mc-
teague would enable us to gain en-
trance to the inner shrine you may
be surprized to know the sea-pirates
were led by a man sworn to protect
the goddess of nyeng sen with his
life it is possible the hand may
cause you embarrassment but it may
on the contrary protect your life i
am sincere in saying that had not my
own hands been trained in surgery
which is my lifework i should have
attempted to replace one with that
hand so great and far-reaching is the
power of nyeng sen and the jimat
on the finger of that hand you wear  

  captain mcteague looked at the
ring crude gold carved in symbols he
did not recognize set with a carved
blue translucent stone

  blue jade captain mcteague
rarer and more valuable than a first-
water diamond of equal size  

  captain mcteague impulsively
held out the brown hand which tai
hoong clasped then his face changed

  the damn thing dont shake
hands right he exclaimed

  for many years it has used the
secret clasp of nyeng sen ex-
plained tai hoong do not attempt
to train it otherwise

  well    about this trip to
nyeng sen  and for an hour
captain mcteague pored over his
charts assisted by the chinese whose
knowledge of hidden lagoons and dark
places on the new guinea shore was
astounding even to mcteague who
had traded there for years

vnce at sea again brigham drank
 a great deal and held ribald con-
versation with klein and schartz
the two companions he had brought
in whose company he seemed to feel
more natural than with mcteague or
tai hoong captain mcteague ig-

nored much since the business of
taking cured human skins was done
there was little use grousing but he
was hoping that brigham would un-
pack his tricks in company of a band
of papuan savages he said as much

  the new guinea warriors have
black skins brigham sort of rich
brown-black skins theyd make nice
foot-gear

  its this way stated brigham
warming to shop-talk ive been fig-
uring the cost of this skin for in-
stance and how many pails of slip-
pers it would cut even dance slip-
pers which take very little material
would come high considering what i
paid to take this leather gad i
could have bought that woman for a
wife real cheap but her skin came
high seems to me the best way would
be to take wives  

    regular bluebeard   suggested
schartz laughing fat wives will
make the most boots

  depends if theyre flabby fat
the skin is soft in places say i need
a name for this leather something
snappy and not a give-away theyd
probably get fussy about human
skins

  something like birds of paradise
eh asked klein by the way they
get paradise plumes from new guinea
where were going why not get the
real thing there   

  too delicate and small for profit
said brigham what about this
nyeng sen name we have fur
names like caracul paws and bellies
of unborn lamb why not breasts
of paradise   

  captain mcteague rose and moved
away with a glance of black disgust at
the ribaldry which came

the first sight of papua crouched
like a black panther on violet
foaming seas seemed less menacing
than these white men he carried the
fetid breaths of her dank river
mouths was cleaner than his human
cargo and papua he remembered


weird tales

was savage pagan immoral and cruel
and for the first time he was glad the
hells of her torture traps could not
avenge such deeds as the slaughter of
this young celebes woman in cold
blood to make dance slippers for
white women captain mcteague was
all for finding the shrine of nyeng
sen speedily and getting shut of his
bargain with brigham of bristol

  it took time to find the place on
that wild northern shore of uncon-
quered papua where tai hoong had
said the inland trail might begin but
they did make it and dropped anchor
in a lagoon at flood tide to have shore
people presently dart out in black
canoes like a flight of arrows from
hidden bowmen and the natives at
the paddles as captain mcteague ob-
served were young men who carried
a netted bag of feathers around their
necks along with adornments of more
sinister origin

  the bag of feathers explained
mcteague is a crest of plumes they
can wear only when they have killed
men theyre friendly enough young
folks usually are but theyre ripe
for trouble  

  why not kill each other asked
brigham

  it isnt done they kill strangers
or enemies and we are both its
only fair to warn you nice black
skins eh

  he beckoned a youth on board or-
dered a fizz drink of harmless quality
and allowed brigham of bristol to
admire the oiled black skin to his
hearts content turning away cap-
tain mcteague thought he saw the
ghost of a smile twitch the lips of tai
hoong he hoped so his own feel-
ing of premonition boded trouble and
he needed a friend as never before

  the offshore wind brought that
alluring sweetness of flower-breath
transcended by jungle moisture that
is the emanations of siren papua
gripping as the memory of perfume
on the hair of a woman beloved the
slumberous blue breasts of papua

were sunset-flamed and passionate
loveliness reached out arms and
twined fingers amorously in the hair
of captain mcteague and in the
lower shore darkness drums throbbed
pulses of desire quick stealthy rus-
tlings as the siren stirred to spring
on these intruders

  captain mcteague invited tai
hoong to go ashore with him and
carry gifts to the village chieftain
there was nothing to be gained by
holding aloof now in an hour or so
the tide would be low and the schoon-
er unable to escape until it flooded
again a bold front was the thing

cooking-pots simmered over fires
that made the night a spotted ter-
ror old women with flabby flesh
moved to serve their lords with shells
of turtle stew captain mcteague
saluted the chief and wished he could
secure the finest crest of paradise
plumes he had ever seen a chieftain
wear he remarked about it

  tawauyo was rather spiritless for a
savage he thought the whole tribe
were lacking that suspiciousness and
formidable resentment which must
usually be overcome before trade be-
gins and only when mcteague men-
tioned that they would like to pen-
etrate the hills to the shrine of
nyeng sen did tawauyo rouse from
apathy the sudden blaze of aged
eyes showed a tender spot touched
mcteague gathered that tawauyo
greatly feared the god at nyeng sen
debbil-debbils sprang from his loins
they haunted river and jungle
thieved pearls for the goddess-wife in
the shrine and made life not worth
living if the white men were going
to nyeng sen he tawauyo would
take their big canoe for his own be-
cause never never would they come
forth to sail it away

  sympathetic and unsmiling cap-
tain mcteague announced that he
would make white magic and drive
out the debbil-debbils but his offer
was met with a shrug of weariness
demon doom of nyeng sen



tawauyo had seen white magic which
was very good for women and chil-
dren he had journeyed to a port and
secured a box of it that also had been
stolen and at times the jungle flared
with the magic lights and grew noisy
with white magic worked by debbil-
debbils possibly they were white-
man debbil-debbils since they acted
strangely as white men did and
danced to the sound of tunes in a box
which all white men carry to the
questions of meteague in pidgin and
tai hoong who r-evealed his amazing
knowledge of tribal jargon that night
tawauyo said that life was scarcely
worth living for his people they
dared not penetrate mazes of jungle
rivers for terror of crocodiles that
talked or hunt on shore for fear of
gray men of the woods who were half
man anyway and acted as if only
their strength was beast and in all
else they were men

  the returning canoes bearing brig-
ham and his cronies put an end to
the sorrowful complaint of tawauyo
drums purred and a dance was start-
ed fermented palm juice added its
potent fire to the lash of drums beat-
ing throbbing purring into wild
thongs of sound that seemed to leave
weals on the flesh of meteague he
saw black men leaping in demoniacal
ecstasy and brigham of bristol ab-
sorbing palm wine and ogling a young
woman on the outer circle

  easy there he cautioned wed
better be going chief he apologized
o tawauyo a white man gets fool-
ish on strong drink

  maybe buy wife suggested ta-
wauyo heap fine mary make for
wife catchem hut a woman in the
bleaching-hut confined until her skin
would be the color of smoky gold
and brigham had heard

    trot her out   he demanded

  none of that roared captain
meteague but brigham was striding
after an old woman commanded to
show him the bleaching beauty

  time to head for the schooner

mc-teague announced aud enforced
his command in the boat brigham
ranted about the woman in the bleach-
ing-hut until meteague restrained an
impulse to knock him overside for
sharks to finish-for the lagoon held
sharks he mentioned his craving
and brigham laughed and began to
howl a song-a maudlin music-hall
ditty but a fair baritone voice

  it was scarce ended when from the
dark shroud of jungle gloom along
shore as if echoing brigham came a
wide-throated roar of song like a
thunderous organ diapason gone mad

  maxwel tons ba-anks r-r-r bo-
oney it howled then broke into
speech na-amin a ship fer-r-r
a-annie la-aurie 

  then meteague knew that the
nightmare of a sickness that had
once plunged him near deaths door
had not been a fever dream after all
that voice belonged to red murphy
a waterfront bum who served time
for murder and he and tai hoong
and brigham of bristol had blundered
into a lagoon haunted by the most ter-
ribly punished criminals the world
held

  worse than dantes inferno was
this sentence of doom passed on red
murphy and his pal tricky turner
and this was the debbil-debbil worry-
ing tawauyo meteague wondered if
it would not be an act of mercy to end
hhe doom of these two criminals but
he did not speak of it for one thing
tai hoong was listening with alert in-
terest  the other three white men were
drunk too far gone to question the
leather quality of that jungle voice
lifting a love song

he lay awake in his berth for some
time recalling vague memories of
his sickness some years ago and the
very bad dreams it brought then he
decided it might be better to start at
once for the open sea give up this
shrine business and get out

  when sleep came it was heavy
dreamless profound he overslept


weird tales

wakened to find tai hoong in his
stateroom for the first time since his
hand healed

  something strange has happened
captain mcteague we are prison-
ers

  mcteague raced on deck in his pa-
jamas then he cursed the lagoon
mouth a narrow entrance between
out-jutting coral reefs was impass-
able jungle trees and brush weighted
by tinted coral newly brought from
the sea-floor effectively formed a bar-
rier that would have to be cleared be-
fore the schooner could sail

  long and earnest talk went back
and forth between mcteague and tai
hoong and the chinese at last pre-
vailed

 the weather is changing the
monsoons are just begun a big
storm would clear that barrier and we
could sail away meanwhile i great-
ly desire to visit this shrine and you
would make it passible

 how demanded mcteague
  how do i figure   

 your hand

  mcteague looked at that shapely
brown hand slender beside his own
marked with the curiously carved
blue jade in a ring of red and yellow
gold

    sort of  hand of fate  eh  

    a hand of destiny perhaps judg-
ment or doom one might invent
many titles captain mcteague i
prefer to believe its power will rid the
world of evil - a sort of demons
doom

  nice hand that commented mc-
teague flexing the fingers why
do you suppose those natives worked
like sluggers all night to hold us in
this lagoon

  they were not to wonder long ar-
rangements went forward to take jun-
gle river trail to the shrine of nyeng
sen and mcteague went ashore to
obtain canoes and guides the matted
mangrove roots embedded in shoreless
river banks prevented the use of the
schooners small power-boat and

they needed guides brigham and
his cronies were still drinking but
they followed mcteague ashore and
were invited to soak further in palm
wine the drums again pulsed forth
their primal martial call to valorous
impulse but tawauyo would not con-
sent to lend guides or canoes to dis-
turb the presiding demon of nyeng
sen in fact like an animal sensing
storm long before a barometer begins
its fall tawauyo was uneasy

  he kept on his feet constantly
peering into the jungle gloom listen-
ing for sounds which the drums might
deaden and toward sunset when the
hills were smoldering in thunderous
gory crimson the avalanche swooped
-rustling in the blackness beyond
fire-flare and leaping dancers - a
crashing that rushed at the circle

 mcteagues guns were knocked
from his hands as they cracked he
was lifted bodily and swept through
lacerating palm fronds and twisting
lianas and thudded breathless over the
crook of a tall tree branch to twist
and recoil in horror from his captor

  a gray man of the woods an orang-
outang clutched claws through his
belt lifted his two hundred pounds
with little effort grinned then
mouthed guttural semblance of human
speech

  saw me afore didnt ye tricky
turners me name an im sick of
bein a monk

  mcteagues brain reeled he was
sick with fear and horror blackness
floated him to semi-consciousness but
a vigorous shake of those powerful
simian arms roused him to the fetid
breath near his face the great jaw
fangs that could rend and tear his
flesh the paws that could split his
body as a banana is peeled

  then he was again lifted and swung
through the air turning fighting
twisting vainly to free himself and at
last plumped down in a stinking
stretch of river mud that reeked of
the sickening odor of mugger walk-
about grounds and putrid remains of
demon doom of nyeng sen



feed crashing through the trees
came a second gray terror and down
came tai hoong in the arms of a
great she-ape in ten minutes they
were joined by other apes each bear-
ing a human burden and the screams
of brigham of bristol were silenced
by a blow of an apes double fist
which drew blood from his blue-mot-
tled lips thereafter for the space of
many minutes silence reigned

  sunset glow penetrated the clearing
in flickering color a strange com-
pany even for a tropic jungle stared
at one another gray-faced white
men the yellow countenance of tai
hoong a sickly green the grinning
circle of apes in charge and along
the river shore dark water split to
reveal the long black snout and mur-
derously fanged jaws of a crocodile

  ha-ail ha-ail the ga-angs a-all
he-ere   sang from the pink leathery
throat   r-re-mem-ber po-o su-ung
tha-at ma-ade us wha-at we a-are
heres whi-ite men tha-at ca-an do
a-anything gi-ive us ba-ack o-our
sha-apes

  captain mcteague remembered in
his sickening fever dream the terrible
po sung had glutted vengeance on
humans transplanted their brains to
this saurian and some orang-outangs
now he knew the nightmare had
taken flesh and blood and caught him
in its insane power a maniacal fear
lashed his blood to frenzy he spoke
as a man might who howls at night-
mare fury to depart

  go on kill us only do it quick
we are not po sung he is dead as
hell why torture us we didnt
harm any of you

  no but yell do us go-ood
yell fetch anoo-other like po sung
an gi-ive us ba-ack our sha-apes

  half fainting for the first time in
his life mcteague glanced at tai
hoong the chinese eyes flickered
the green skin had regained its nor-
mal yellow

  i have studied under po sung
he said but you would not care to

emerge in the body of a slant-eyed
yellow-faced chinese

  na-aw roared from the mug-
gers throat  theys just two av us
to bo-other abo-out tri-icky an  me-e
the gals is na-ative an sos the oother
buck spe-eak up tri-icky whi-ich
wan ye cho-oose

not de chink howled from the
throat of the ape which held captain
mcteague fast dis bloke suits me
captain mcteague is a guardian
of nyeng sen said tai hoong

  also i shall need help with this
work a third reason is that he is the
only one capable of sailing his ship to
a port you will want to get away
from the jungle of course  

  mcteague saw that klein and brig-
ham lay limp inert and schartz
was in a stupor of fear none of the
three understood this terrible doom
impending or the hell circle formed in
the jungle where powers of darkness
loosed by a fiend in human form had
gathered for vengeance too terrific to
contemplate there came a time when
gathering darkness the miasmie
stench of swamps the nauseating filth
of the walk-about ground crowded
mcteague until he was hardly aware
of what went forward except the
voice of the mugger endlessly howling
argument and the quiet controlled
speech of tai lloong playing a des-
perate game for time for life

  he knew only that presently he was
lifted swung through the jungle with
lianas clutching and dragging at his
feet and hunched in the circle of fires
deserted by the natives piled high by
the jungle ghouls there a gourd of
palm wine started his blood again and
the icy clutch of fear about his heart
retreated reason mounted its throne
and he understood many things

  the mugger had left his river and
lay basking  the heated coral and
an ape poured wine down the great
pink gullet they were like trained
servants for red murphy the mugger
and tricky turner the man-ape obey-
ing commands fetching carrying al-


weird tales

most meekly subservient and once
in the silence as the mugger pondered
something tai hoong had said mc-
teague caught a moan his head
came up the muggers long black
snout turned the apes listened

  fetch ut he-erc commanded the
mugger and an ape swung into the
blackness beyond then returned car-
rying something that mewed in agony
and laid it on the coral

  mcteague leaped to his feet the
hand of his guardian ape circled his
throat and held him then he threw
up an arm to shut out the sight of a
girl who had once been pretty skin
bleached to color of gold ash head like
a feather duster who had been staked
down and was being flayed alive

  mcteague crowded back against the
ape that held him oblivious to the ter-
rible proximity of the beast and in
one flood of rage that shut out all
other feais he turned on the rousing
brigham

is this girl your work brigham
didnt have time to finish mut-
tered brigham klein and i just got
started good taxidermist klein-

lovely skin that girl-

  tai hoong roared captain mc-
teague you once gave me a hand-
a hand of doom of demons doom you
said give me one sign that there is
justice in this world or power in man
to rid the race of its brutal fiends
aborted from human shape give red
murphy what he wants and tricky
turner and this other ape  

  and somehow the form of captain
mcteague in his torn shirt and bloody
scratches of flesh took on majesty and
height and the strange hand was up-
lifted in that gesture which ancient
gods of the east make in stone and
bronze and golden effigy

  and across the circle of firelight
tai hoong rose and became stately
and terrible as his hands clasped each
other and he bowed from the waist
as before god-head

  then in the jungle formed a pro-
cession of dreadful import such as the

world has not seen since the armored
apes of the simian city of hanumau
pranced forthto savage music that
abused the senses and jangled towers
upthrust against the burning sky

  mcteague stalked forth followed
by his captor whose claws were hooked
in his belt tai hoong followed with
head carried high and eyes ablaze
and swinging along came the miser-
able humans jerked like rag dolls in
the clutch of the gray apes along
the river bank they went so that the
mugger could more readily keep pace
and from his throat roared the sonor-
ous sounds that called to mind a black-
plumed hearse and following charger
with saddle and stirrups reversed the
dead march from saul

  swinging through trees overhead
were a company of orang-outangs car-
rying gourds of palm wine and other
things which mcteague could not
make out it seemed to captain mc-
teague that his body was detached
separate insensate one burning fur-
nace of wrath roared behind his eyes
for alongside as if designed to
flaunt the wickedness which white
men did to natives came a she-ape
carrying as lightly as a woman cai-
ries her baby the half-flayed body of
the hut-bleached girl still moaning
although her eyes were glazed and
tai hoong had muttered the only
comforting thing his lips uttered in
that hour that she was beyond feeling
pain

  deep into the jungle they plunged
and captain mcteague saw the
beauty of that pre-adam period when
survival depended on brawn on fang
and claw and stupendous strength
they could not have made that jour-
ney in weeks of hacking through jun-
gle growth or paddling the trackless
shoreless rivers webbed with man-
gvoves that spi-out their seeds on the
trees and send down roots to web the
water with entangling death snares
but in the arms of the great apes they
were carried high swiftly safely and
always within sound of that booming
demon doom of nyeng sen



dead march roared from the throat
of the mugger

  paradise birds dancing on tall tree-
tops in the early sun of dawn soared
like living jewels lorries flashed
furious color squawking raucously as
they winged from this procession
captain meteague looked down on
river shores blazoned with profusion
of monstrous scarlet flowers whose hot
perfume seemed potent as chloroform
his senses reeled his body was limp
as a rag when the ape swung down
and dropped him like a sack on a
clearing walled by dense dark jungle
his breath rasped like dead husks
but he was aware that the gray ghouls
had arrived with their human bur-
dens and the swampy stream now ran
limpid and green-shining through gar-
dens and was arched by red lacquered
bridges that glowed in the moist heat
like jewels against the hot blueness
of a sky sailed by cloud argosies tow-
ers stood like candles dripping re-
flected light from plaques of porcelain
and lacquer green bushes ablaze
with bloom shielded its lower story

a moment later an exhausted sweat-
ing tai hoong came from his ape
captor to meteague

  nyeng sen he announced

  gourds were passed and meteague
swigged thirstily and knew the benef-
icence of wine dulling fear rousing
courage and he needed courage for
a company of apes came from the di-
rection of the temple jacketed in
shining metal tunics swinging with
the precision of soldiers although
they flew rather than marched but
their flight did not disarrange the
long stream of ghouls that stretched
from the surrounding gardens to the
jungle edge where meteague and his
company waited

  now captain meteague you take
command said tai hoong your
hand-

  lord breathed meteague in-
voluntarily lifting the strange hand
to have a look himself at this member

which tai hoong had called de-
mons doom and the oncoming
gray ghouls saw a yelp from the
leader and they halted their stormy
gray lines up-ended with the tail of
the line swinging forward to enclose
the jungle crowd

  standing beside captain meteague
tai hoong spoke words that mc-
teague could not understand and
from the arms of one ape a figure
dropped toddled a feeble step nearer
and disclosed under the limp skin of
an orang-outang he wore as a cloak
an aged yellow man clad in jewel-em-
broidered robe his eyes were on the
uplifted hand of jock meteague on
which the symbolic ring caught sun-
flre and glowed he spoke and tai
hoong bowed from the waist

  meteague did not learn what
passed between these two men of the
east but between wheeling lines of
the ape army of nyeng sen they
were escorted to the temple gates
guarded by apes who fell back at their
approach and captain meteague was
aware that the ring on his strange
hand opened these gates and the
shaven priest who met them at the
lower step found in that hand-grip
which meteague could not change or
control some open sesame which
cleared the way

  the next hour was one of such re-
lief that meteague neither knew nor
cared whether he had fallen into a
death trap or the trail of life he was
bathed his body anointed and mas-
saged he was fed and clothed in
robes of blue silk embroidered with
designs of gold thread and gems and
he slept the moon shone through
the round windows of the room where
he lay on a satin-padded floor mat-
tress and a white-robed attendant
was setting sparks alight on incense
and offering him a cool drink

  somewhere there was murmuring
sound pulsing like music he ate
curried chicken and rice drank deep-
ly of the tart cool liquid offering in
a gem-encrusted chalice and was pres-


weird tales

ently crowned with a gaudy head-
dress on which jewels quivered from
gold wires then he was led through
dark corridors lighted with smoky
torches in wall sconces to a vast room
where moon-silver poured through
round wall apertures and wall torches
lent lurid flares of flame he wanted to
shrink along one wall in his ridic-
ulous robes and bonnet of jewels but
there was no choice through gray
apes crouched on the floor in their
metal jackets he was led to a distant
dais that seemed a shimmering blaze
of light coming closer he saw that
the shining wall was made of dancing-
girls in metal cloth dresses who stood
motionless as statues flanking a group
of shaven priests in resplendent robes
to stools below the priests he was led
and tai hoong appeared from some-
where to sit beside him below was a
couch draped with a white gauze pall
under which lay something human
tai hoong spoke softly whispered
from unmoving lips

  judgment is taken from you this
white man has killed a woman des-
tined to be a dancer of nyeng sen
belonging to the gods the doom of
nyeng sen will fall

  the music he had heald came near-
er swelled pealed through the hall
and the wall of dancers suddenly
swooped into motion for an endless
time mcteague watched the postur-
ing slow dance of the east until he
grew drowsy-eyed and the light-
footed woman creatures in their
gleaming robes seemed butterflies
wheeling drunkenly then a single
gorgeous whirling flame of dancing
flew down spinning like a diamond
top until it seemed that human
strength could not keep such mad mo-
tion mcteague closed his eyes

  when the music ceased with a crash
of cymbals he looked again

  the priests descended there was
a stir forward and before that cov-
ered couch came apes of the jungle
dragging three white men the white
pall was lifted and mcteague sick-

ened at the sight on the white couch
arms of smoky gold folded about a
small red orchid of that genus along
the river which poured forth its lethal
breath her pretty face framed in
dark curls as bushy as a feather crest
lay the girl of the village bleaehing-
hut and from her waist down was
revealed the hellish cruelty of brig-
ham the expert skill of flaying her
golden skin

  it was tai hoong who acted as in-
terpreter for the priests mcteague
realized that brigham was either
drunk or drugged for he turned
braggart again threatening tai
hoong with the authorities of the
ports easting the blame for the work
on klein making the excuse that they
had not killed her and the jungle
trip was to blame

  the pursuit of eastern vengeance
earnestly laid on the lap of gods is
long and patient but the judgment of
nyeng sen was swift for the ben-
efit of brigham tai hoong translated

  some time ago great surgeons
made the successful experiment of
transplanting brains of humans into
the skulls of apes po sung who was
once a power in this temple used a
river crocodile we have seen them
heard them and know they are un-
happy in their present incarnation
it is the judgment of nyeng sen that
these men have expiated their sen-
tences for deeds not as evil as the out-
rage of this girl destined for the god-
dance of nyeng sen it is the sen-
tence of nyeng sen that brigham of
bristol and klein the taxidermist
change physical form with red mur-
phy and tricky turner i have
spoken 

  and at that judgment of doom mc-
teague leaped to his feet to protest
threw up his arms to silence the roar
of ape throats that greeted the end of
the audience and involuntarily added
the finality of the upraised hand dis-
playing the symbol of nyeng sen

  the hall leaped to life like gray
stormy seas and as magically clear
demon doom of nyeng sen



meteague stood clutching the arm of
tai hoong to keep his feet and hear-
ing the screams of brigham and
klein suddenly he remembered
schartz and asked tai hoong in one
word

  the brain of the dying girl was
transferred to the head of schartz
said tai hoong he or she is re-
covering nicely

  then captain meteague fainted

  he wakened in an ornate tiny
building fashioned after the towers of
the temple with carved pillars sup-
porting its spire he was attended
and waited upon served with lux-
uries cared for as never before in his
life and it was quiet there he
looked out at endless garden beauties
and the far-away blue menace of the
jungle wall he lost count of days
and decided the wine was drugged
because nothing seemed to matter nor
did he care about his predicament or
his schooner waiting in the lagoon

  then one day tai hoong appeared
clad in dragon-embroidered black
satin sleek-skinned suave quiet-
voiced

  we are free to return captain
meteague he said very much the
same company in appearance as when
we came do you feel equal to meet-
ing your passengers for the return
trip

captain mcteague went with tai
 hoong and met brigham and
klein and schartz a trio somewhat
refined in appearance thinner paler
pathetically quiet and hesitant and
meteague decided he had been strick-
en with jungle fever and imagined the
great hall of nyeng sen the dancers
the judgment the demons doom until
brigham spoke in that thick brogue
of the river mugger but a voice no
more like the roaring thunder of the
swamp night than a drawing-room
voice resembles the howling magnified
by a megaphone

  red murphys proud to shake yer
hand sor and mighty thankful for

meeting you widout makin a meal of
ye on sight-as i did manys the wan
faith ye dont know how hungry a
mugger gits and all 

    the same from me   said the man
in the likeness of klein and im a
deal handsomer nor i was as tricky
turner sir thanks be to you an the
chink surgeon sir  

 captain meteague was mute
struck dumb by the transformation
unable at that moment to comprehend
the enormity of joy that made these
men tremble as they spoke he looked
at schartz who shrank timidly to
one side and uttered native words of
which meteague caught only one
marshter as the woman in man
shape dropped and bumped a fore-
head to the earth

  meteague turned abruptly from
the temple doors came the ape army
in their shining foolish jackets long
columns of gray men of the woods
streaming from the great doors
swooping in that airy floating lithe-
ness that is the marvel of simian
movement catching up the men
swinging them along flying high in
the upper stratum of forest green up
with mountain beasts and birds over
the steaming perfumed flanks of the
dark land

  down they swooped to avillage at
noonday meal villagers scattered as
if blown by the typhoon power and
left the cooking-pots unattended the
fires were scattered the pots over-
turned the huts entered and searched
for hidden pearls then the ape army
danced silently ghastly grotesquely
foolish a wheeling chain of gray
ghouls linked by paws and tails and
from the river swamps came a howl-
ing roaring cry of despair

  for gods sake do-ont le-eave me
li-ike thi-is

  brigham of bristol said tai
hoong

  and me-in the name of heaven
shoot me kill me

  klein muttered captain mc-
teague look tai hoong the for-


weird tales

lorn ape in the tree and his body
going with us on the schooner back
to god knows what    and brig-
hams body  to bristol tai
hoong theyd be better dead what
will red murphy do in brighams
shoes

  a ghost of a smile twitched the lips
of tai hoong

  an interesting experiment to
watch captain mcteague-red mur-
phy as the proprietor of brighams
beautiful boots i think one thing
is certain he will not inhumanly flay
living natives for material for
womens dance slippers perhaps-
who knows  - the demon doom of
nyeng sen is wisdom of the gods
punishment that fits the crime

  then by what justice was i made
witness of these horrors demanded
mcteague prisoned in the lagoon
losing a season 

  it was the ape army that answered
his question they swung to the coral
reefs cleared the debris working like
trojans and captain mcteague took
the oars of a boat to pull his human
cargo out

  the schooners deck was empty of
black men who had vanished at sight
of the apes captain mcteague went
below to rout them from hiding in
the hold and the sight of a lantern
clutched in the stiange hand acted
more quickly and effectively than a
lash he followed the malays on deck

discarded his gorgeous robe felt it
drop heavily and lifted it to see what
caused its weight then he gasped

  those buttons he had not noticed
before were pearls caught in claws of
gold there were embroideries of solid
drilled pearls there were pockets
pearl-filled   

  and on shore were the apes stand-
ing like soldiers and as he lifted the
strange hand in farewell their arms
were flung high in silent salutation

  there is an expression in your
tongue captain mcteague said tai
hoong about angels unaware
perhaps too sentimental a term to
apply to a sea captain but scourge
of the lord is also unseamanlike the
idea is that nyeng sen has long been
searching for klein and schartz and
brigham of bristol you have been
the means of bringing them to the
inner shrine and judgment the ma-
cassar pirates sent long ago on their
trail blundered fortunately for us
and gave us the hand of power you
feel that you are repaid somewhat i
hope  

  pearls poured through the fingers
of the strange hand as captain mc-
teague pondered on deck the ma-
lays had spread canvas the tide was
flooding the lagoon entrance clear
and one by one the brown men
donned their baggy trousers their
lace jackets and fantastic twisted
hats it looked like fair weather a

 an i interest you

  i was standing supposedly
alone in the darkest corner
of the big storage room and the ques-
tion startled me yet so absurd was
the idea it carried that i laughed

  hardly i answered merely
another case of a cat and a king
still im interested at that anyone
but a dead person would be in such
a car

  the manager of the hobson motor
company for such i recognized the
speaker to be shot me a searching
look bit his lip and dropped his
eyes hastily to a resplendent front
hub its a great machine he re-
marked

    why whats the matter with it  
the listlessness of his voice stirred
my curiosity

  not a thing-not a thing in the

up- zy it was gruesomely familiar
	with its blood-marked brow

               and disheveled gray hair

world but his assurance was not
convincing

  comes at something like five
thousand dollars doesnt it

  and twelve hundred more new

   	 new  isnt it new   

  the man shook his head and shifted
his gaze to the fender been out
about three months though its only
been run around five hundred miles  
  somebody eouldnt meet his pay-
ments   

  no wanted a lighter car be-
sides the color is a little odd too
youll notice

  a little i agreed amusedly
  at least it isnt every day that one
sees a purple car with lilac uphol-
stery but then a good finisher and
upholsterer could remedy all that
he caught at my remark better
let me sell it to you

                                    


weird tales

  i laughed again i couldnt buy
a set of tires for a ear like that to
say nothing of the ear itself

  you wouldnt need to for a long
time it carries two spares youll
notice and neither of them has ever
been on as to the price were pre-
pared to make that right he was
eager now

  you dont know how ridiculously
right it would have to be to come
within my reach i told him and
started to turn away

  he stopped me but you could
at least make us an offer what could
you give

    my old bus the mechanic is work-
ing on out in the repair room i an-
swered joking of course

  oh now surely you can do a
little better than that make it a
hundred besides  

  cant do it

  but your old car-why wed be
practically making you a gift of the
sedan  

  you would be anyway for that
matter but i simply cant afford the
hundred  

  but listen lady- suddenly

lie stopped clenched his hands and
endeavored to look off across the dim
storeroom slowly and reluctantly
however as if some unseen power
were compelling him he brought his
head around not to face me but to
stare into the lilac depths of the
purple sedan his eyes were bulging
his chin hanging down

man i cried seizing his arm
md shaking him are you ill
lere sit down on the running-board
vierciful heavens you mustnt look
ike that

  whatever the spell that was upon
him my action seemed to restore his
self-possession he turned squarely
about and addressed me in a voice
but slightly shaken you can have
the car on your own terms drive it
out

  my eyes in turn must have bulged
say i demanded whats the

matter here is this stolen property
or is the engine gone or what   
were guaranteeing both the title
and the mechanical condition if that
means anything  

  but man whats the idea you
havent even seen my car its four
years old and looks every bit of it
and besides has all the internal ail-
ments a car can possibly be heir to
only a little while ago it had to be
towed in and right now the mechanic
isnt sure it will ever run again

    no matter about all that-that is
if you care to trade

  oh ill trade all right only id
like to know what is back of it all
wouldnt it be enough to know
that should you be displeased with
your bargain you may have your old
car back-and keep this one too

  i stared in astonishment finally
i got hold of my voice i wont say
it would be enough still it would be
a great deal

  then suppose we let it go at
that

tex minutes later i had nosed the
purple sedan out of its gloomy
corner and headed it toward home i
live ten miles out and since the
afternoon was already well advanced
and i proved to be rather awkward
in handling a strange car early dusk
had fallen by the time i turned off
the main highway and entered the
strip of woods that gives privacy to
my bit of property the road here
is a sand one and the tracks deep
enough to preclude all danger of a
cars going astray furthermore
there would still be considerable light
once i had cleared the timber conse-
quently i did not turn on the lights
as i slid into the deeper darkness

  it had been a warm day for feb-
ruary even in florida and the eve-
ning that followed was delightfully
balmy but scarcely had i entered the
woods before i drew my light coat
closely about my throat against the
sudden chill that seemed to envelop
the purple sedan



the ear my action was futile how-
ever for the feeling of coldness con-
tinued it crept up along my spine
concentrating with such intensity at
the back of my neck that the hair
there seemed to bristle and i had
the conviction that a pair of eyes
were boring into it in addition to
this unpleasant sensation or perhaps
as a result of it i was seized with an
uncontrollable desire to look behind
and regardless of my obligation to
the car i did

  i did not start at what i saw nor
cry out indeed i was powerless to
do so as one is in a dream a woman
was on the back seat a gray shadowy
disheveled woman the signs of a ter-
rible struggle fresh upon her-hat-
less tom and blood-marked under
wisps of tumbling gray hair at a
glance and despite her battered and
disarranged appearance there was
discernible about her in the quiet el-
egance of her clothes and the simplic-
ity of her bearing a certain well-bred
inconspicuousness that marked her as a
member of a class rather than as an
individual yet definite as this im-
pression was her form and features
searched had that vague indistinct-
ness that ordinarily belongs to objects
in a dream that is all except her
eyes which were bright and black and
steady and burned into mine with a
probing searching fire

  how long the vision held me i do
not know but suddenly i became
aware of light and warmth and the
car was emerging into the compara-
tive brightness of my little home
clearing

tt was not until i was out of the
purple sedan and inside my tiny
cottage that i was able to think
clearly once more then strange to
say my first thoughts were of amuse-
ment rather than of fear or wonder
how my grandmother would have
doted on my recent experience how
smoothly it would have fitted with her

well-worn repertoire of old-world
ghost stories and supernatural dem-
onstrations  how joyously she would
have seized upon it as a weapon with
which to rout my youthful doubts
for despite her persistent teachings i
had always been an obnoxiously prac-
tical and hard-headed youngster re-
fusing stubbornly to believe anything
that i had no particular occasion to
believe but the curious part was
that now that i had that occasion i
still did not believe or did i have
it were there such things as optical
illusions hallucinations imaginary
visions due to overwrought nerves
true i am not a nervous person but
mightnt my recent transaction have
excited me the least bit besides
there are likely to be shadows where
there are woods and maybe i had
even dozed a little

  as for the managers anxiety to
dispose of the purple sedan that was
a different matter that was hard
to explain perhaps though if i
looked into things a little i could see
a reason for even that therefore with
all haste i delved into the small
sheaf of papers i had acquired along
with the ear there were but two of
them of any value so far as my pur-
pose was concerned the original
certificate of ownership and the trans-
fer issued to the hobson motor com-
pany from these documents i was
surprized to learn that the motor
company had owned the machine al-
most exactly two months the original
purchaser barely one his title dating
from the fifth of december i fell to
studying the mans name drennan
- drennan - jasper h drennan
where had i heard that name be-
fore not among my flesh-and-blood
acquaintances i was suie nor those
i had come to know through the pages
of fiction yet the name so persisted
in tantalizing me with its familiarity
that i could not rest until i had made
an effort toward solving the mystery
of its appeal


weird tales

  there was but one avenue of en-
quiry open to me consequently i
turned to it eagerly from a closet
i brought out stacks of old news-
papers saved against house-cleaning
time and these i searched far into
the night for any mention of the
disturbing name finally i found
it and the reason for its strange
familiarity for nearly a week it
had graced the front pages of most
of the states leading dailies in con-
nection with one of those sensational
disappearance cases with which the
reading public has been deluged the
last few years i had merely read
the headlines before but now fired
by a sort of personal interest i fol-
lowed the affair through all the edi-
tions hoping against hope that every
next line would have something to
say about a purple sedan but in
this i was disappointed although i
did gather up some interesting if
more or less indirect information re-
garding the man to whom the sedan
originally belonged

 according to the papers mrs
felicia washburn drennan wealthy
northern woman and owner of con-
siderable property in and about the
city of miami had disappeared from
her berth on a north-bound tiain
sometime during the night of decem-
ber fifth or the morning following
early in the evening friends of the
woman had called for her at her
suburban home and driven her to the
railroad station where she had
boarded a train for sanford a little
town well up the state there she
was to meet her husband jasper h
drennan who was returning next day
from a business trip to jacksonville
those who had accompanied the
woman to the train saw her enter her
pullman and the conductor later re-
ported that a ticket corresponding to
the number of the berth she was known
to have had was extended to him
through the curtains of the compart-
ment but there all trace of her had

ended the porter had not been on
hand when she had entered the coach
and she had at no time required his
services consequently the man had
never seen her and since there had
been passengers alighting at the dif-
ferent stations could not say when
or where she had left the train
when however he began to make up
the berths beyond sanford he was
certain that the one bearing her num-
ber had been empty when she did
not meet her husband as planned the
latter thinking she had missed her
train set himself to wait for her she
did not arrive on the next train
either so that he became anxious and
late in the afternoon telephoned
their home learning from the serv-
ants of her departure the evening-
before he immediately caught a train
home notified the police department
and started an investigation days
of exhaustive search followed but at
last even the official body was forced
to admit failure for neither clue nor
motive could be found to throw any
light on the womans disappearance

  the drennans the papers ex-
plained were newcomers in the
south having come from ohio where
they had been recently married mrs
drennan was formerly the widow of
john h washburn the soap manu-
facturer and drennan a clerk in the
washburn office the former mrs
washburn sole heir to her husbands
large estate had disposed of the soap
factory and after coming south had
invested heavily in grove and city
property over which she had estab-
lished her new husband as manager
she had no other relatives anywhere
and so far as was known no enemies
moreover according to her husband
there was no domestic trouble and
the servants bore him out in this

  it was not an especially interesting
story and by no means an enlighten-
ing one so far as my desires were
concerned consequently i was finally
forced to go to bed in disappoint-
ment
the purple sedan



if i had been pleased with my
transaction the day before i was
even more so when i saw the machine
by the light of the morning sun
perhaps its color was a little more
pronounced than i had thought in
the mellowness of the waning light
but if it was so was its unmarred
newness its gracefulness of line its
richness of equipment

  on close inspection however there
were apparent two minor defects
that i had not noticed before though
these were so slight as to be prac-
tically negligible they were merely
that the mate to the elaborately cut
glass vase behind the drivers seat
was missing and the upholstery back
of the wheel was crushed and packed
as if it had been pressed by wet gar-
ments and not brushed afterward
but i did not let these small matters
worry me another vase could be
found somewhere and a good brush
and the tea-kettle would take care of
the upholstery whenever i had the
time and the inclination to apply
them i must admit that at that
particular moment it was the latter
that was lacking so eager was i
to see the astonishment on the faces
of my friends and neighbors when
they saw my new car that i could not
bear to lose any time in starting the
show i could steam upholstery while
the community was recovering from
its surprize

  despite my impatience it was some
little time before i was ready to
start on my tour of display in the
first place i had some important
letters to write and in the second i
had to look the place half over for
the papers belonging to the old car
for i had decided that after i had
shown off before my acquaintances in
the neighboring village i would go on
to town and consummate my part of
the trade by handing over the
necessary documents my numerous
preparations completed i finally
backed the purple sedan into the road
and headed for the village a mile

away that is it is a mile if one goes
the direct way but at the comer of
my clearing an unpleasant memory
of the night before assailed me so
that i turned aside on a more circui-
tous road one that avoided the strip
of woods that had been the scene of
my unusual experience

  it was noontime as i drove into the
little settlement a brilliant southern
noon with the air like balm and the
entire population out enjoying it
children played by the wayside men
loafed about the streets women
visited in dooryards or called to one
another across bits of lawn

  suddenly in the midst of all this
light and life i felt myself grow
deathly cold and sensed that i was
no longer driving the car but that it
was taking its way along the busy
street of its own volition at almost
the same moment some magnetic
power drew my eyes to the reflector
above the windshield there instead
of a reverse picture of the road i had
just traveled i saw a pair of burn-
ing eyes and a blood-stained hair-
bedraggled brow in another instant
the car was turning out for the ice-
truck and the vision had vanished

  having lost all zest for my errand
to the village i drove straight into
town and to the office of the hobson
motor company as the manager
recognized me a hard look came over
his face

  what have you come for he
demanded somewhat belligerently

  to give you these papers-and to
ask some questions

  he dropped his head and waited

  who is she

  he straightened at my words
then you have seen too

  yes last night and again a few
minutes ago what does it mean

  god knows

  did the man who sold the car
know

  he must have or he wouldnt
have been so anxious to get rid of it

  why not tell me about it


weird tales

    there isnt much to tell-and yet
a great deal it was the sixth of
december-i remember the date be-
cause of the unusually heavy rain-
storm that swept over this section
that afternoon along about ten
oclock at night while the rain was
still pouring a man drove into the
garage and wanted to leave his car
for the night ordinarily i wouldnt
have been here at that hour but we
were putting on a new night man
and i had stayed to help him get
started usually too i dont pay
any attention to our storage patrons
since an assistant has them in charge
but on this occasion watching to see
that the helper performed his duties
properly and above all that he in-
sisted on the cars being parked in a
remote comer so as to leave as much
space as possible for later machines
i couldnt help noticing the stranger
first because of the magnificent car
he was driving and second because
of the extremely soaked condition of
his clothes how he could have gotten
so wet in such a machine was entirely
beyond my comprehension especially
since he did not look like the type of
man who attends to his own tire
trouble

  all of this being none of my
business however i soon forgot about
it in the bustle of starting home in-
deed i doubt if i would ever have
thought of the incident again if the
assistant hadnt come to me a week
later and asked what he was to do
about the purple sedan since it
hadnt been called for yet and was
more or less in the way there wasnt
anything he could do about it of
course and since the owner had
looked amply able to pay as large a
storage bill as he felt like running up
and the car was good for it anyway i
told the man we wouldnt worry but
would just let the matter rest we
did for an entire month then to our
surprize we received a letter from
the owner saying he was dissatisfied
with the car and wanted to trade it

-even-for one of our sport sixes his
only condition being that we were to
deliver the latter our car stands at
only sixteen hundred fully equipped
so you can imagine we were com-
pletely knocked off the christmas
tree by his offer it seemed too good
to be safe so we immediately started
an investigation to our surprize
everything proved to be perfectly
regular consequently we lost no time
in closing the deal for fear the fellow
would change his mind

    the car being now our own i sent
a man to polish it up preparatory to
placing it hi the salesroom for dis-
play i was present when he went
to begin work he had approached
the machine with the intention of
running it into a part of the room
where the light was better his hand
on the door he was about to pull it
open when he suddenly sprang back
with the most horrified exclamation i
have ever heard a man utter when
i got to him his hands were over his
face and he was trembling like a leaf

   what on earth is the matter
i asked thinking he had suffered a
stroke

    a woman a woman in there 
he chattered

   nonsense man i began and
turned to prove the absurdity of his
statement half-way in my gesture
i stopped frozen with horror and
surprize there on the velvet cush-
ions sat a woman so horribly bat-
tered and bloody that involuntarily i
closed my eyes to shut out the sight
when i got control of myself and
looked again i had serious doubts of
my own sanity for the car was
absolutely empty

  from that day we never touched
the purple sedan again my man
left that night and i got other help
but as often as i sent someone to
move the car the woman offered her
silent interference so that i finally
concluded the big machine was not to
be tampered with twice i sent
prospective customers to look at it-
the purple sedan



men from out of town who i thought
would not do us much damage by
talking one of them ran out of the
place screaming and both thereafter
took their patronage elsewhere i
tell you that accursed car has all but
wrecked our business during the
last month weve had ten men in the
storage room and besides have lost
two of our best salesmen and the book-
keeper a sinister influence is bound
to spread you know

  i might as well admit right here
that you looked like an answer to
prayer to me yesterday when i saw
you inspecting the purple sedan at
close range without suffering any
shock from it do you know i would
actually have paid you to take that
magnificent elephant off our hands
rather than let you go away without
it

  still you asked me a hundred
boot  

  yes the business instinct is
strong in most of us i thought for
a moment though that i had spoiled
everything if i had i suppose it
would have served me right still
surely a poor man is excusable for
trying to save something out of a cool
sixteen hundred dollars

  at the expense of innocence
the manager shook his head
  evidently not  

  i laughed mirthlessly im afraid
that didnt have anything to do with
it you see i really didnt have the
hundred  

  he stared at me blankly

  as i was rising to leave he made
out to ask what are you going to
do with the car

  the only thing there is to do i
told him keep it again he stared
-stupidly

t must confess that i was in no
a happy state of mind as i re-
entered the purple sedan most of
us i suppose have our responsibil-
ities thrust upon us and of course i
had no right to expect to be an excep-

tion but to be servant of a ghost
and i of all people who didn t be-
lieve in ghosts yet didnt i true
my mind influenced by its own
scientific training and the leadership
of a scoffing world laughed at the
idea of supernatural things but deep
down in the innermost regions of my
heart hadnt i always known they
existed  why else that early absorp-
tion of even the smallest detail of my
grandmothers spirit lore that un-
conscious retentiveness that made
every light and shadow of it stand
out distinctly after all these years
and why else also my election to
own a haunted car of what use
would an unbeliever be to a spirit in
distress for that matter under
such circumstances what use would
a believer be unless he was equipped
with a deep insight into the ways of
the supernatural there was the
rub-the reason why i rather than
someone else must bear the weight
of this unwelcome burden-the educa-
tion my grandmother had instilled
into me so many years ago i prob-
ably alone of all who had comc in
contact with the haunted car knew
that once it has laid aside its physical
form only a soul in torment lingers
upon this earthly sphere and that its
purpose in so doing is not to terrorize
or appall its former kind but to find
one among them who will relieve it
of its burden by performing the
urgent task or mission that itself in
its unsubstantial state is helpless to
accomplish until it finds such a
person and attains its desires it may
not take the rest for which it longs
to one who understands it is an un-
thinkable thing to leave a soul in
anguish without making the utmost
effort to set it free

  as to the nature of the burden that
was oppressing my ghostly suppliant
i did not speculate there was but
one way i could learn that i must
ask and ask properly when i
should ask must depend on the spirit
itself on the time of its next appear-


weird tales

anee if it should be that very after-
noon i must somehow steel myself to
my duty for there was nothing to be
gained by delay

  but i was allowed to finish my
drive alone though i derived very
little comfort from the fact for i
knew that sooner or later the hour
would come for my interview with
the specter and the physical part of
me dreaded it-dreaded it more than
i liked to admit for day after day i
gave myself a perfectly good reason
for declining to drive the purple
sedan even though my cupboard was
growing unpleasantly empty and i
knew that important mail was await-
ing me at the post-office

  but the matter was not left to my
own initiative one night an exact
week after i had come into possession
of the haunted car i awoke from a
deep sleep with the feeling that some-
thing unwonted was astir about the
premises i raised myself from my
pillow and peered through the win-
dow into the dim night at first
nothing unusual rewarded my search
only the shadowy outline of the fence
the shrubs and the few outbuildings
then close in front of the garage
doors something moved something
tall and draped and only distinguish-
able from the rest of the night by its
increased shadowiness where the
doors joined it paused and stood as if
waiting

  a cold sweat enveloped my body
for i knew that the ordeal i had
dreaded was at hand i slipped out
of bed however and in the dark-
ness began to don my clothes the
luminous hands of the clock on the
dresser pointed slightly past one

  having arrayed myself the best i
could for a journey concerning the
nature and destination of which i
had no idea i stepped resolutelyforth
into the shadowy night as i rounded
the comer of the garage the dim form
melted away into the shade of the
shrubbery

t had barely touched the gear lever
a when the big car began backing
out of the garage and a minute later
we were upon the public road except
that the car moved as if guided by
magic there was no further sign of
my ghostly companion until we were
well beyond the borders of my little
clearing then i suddenly became
aware of a familiar sensation at the
back of my neck no need to turn
around now in fact i had no in-
clination to do so but looking straight
ahead asked in a voice that i myself
barely recognized in the name of
the lord what do you want   

  a sort of sigh went through the
car and a voice that had no earthly
quality answered peace

     can i help you to find it  

  you alone can help me
  how

  cause my body to be taken from
its unhallowed grave and buried in
consecrated ground

  how am i to do this

  obey

  already we were approaching the
point where the woods road joins the
main highway without any gui-
dance on my part the big car swung
to the left and shot like a bullet along
the deserted thoroughfare

  it seemed but a moment from the
time the village fell behind until the
larger town appeared and another
until we reached the comer where a
half-dozen trails converge a white
blur of signboards marked the place
but as we flashed past one of them
stood out distinctly it pointed
straight ahead and was marked
miami

  on through the night we rushed
over roads i had never traveled
through towns i had never seen
eventually a thick fog settled but
the car bore resolutely on sweeping
the mist-veiled road like the wind
threading with uncanny deftness the
turns and curves that sprang out of
the night to confound it at last a
the purple sedan



gradual thinning of the darkness pro-
claimed that morning was at hand
but the fog continued to hold it in
leash town after town we passed
without distinguishing more than
occasional early-lit windows even
the shoulders of the pavement were
indiscernible through the mist

  suddenly i felt a change in the be-
havior of the car its bumping and
heaving warned me that something
was wrong i struggled to get con-
trol but my arms curled inertly
around the wheel for so long were
slow about functioning so that the
machine had jumped and reeled quite
a distance before i could bring it to a
stop when i did i discovered that
we had left the pavement and were
now on an old unused road the rich
tangle of grass that carpeted it told
me that we were in low country prob-
ably near a swamp so that i did not
dare to turn the big machine for fear
of what might be lurking just beyond
the fog then i noticed that a golden
glow had begun to brighten the mist
and knew that the sun was struggling
to burst through while i watched it
gradually prevailed dissolving the
dense curtain now here now there
until it finally left disclosed a half-
fallen trappers cabin encircled at a
little distance by huge magnolia trees
and cypresses enrobed with spanish
moss

  it was a small neck of land on
which i had stopped so narrow at
that particular spot that the stagnant
swamp waters almost reached the
wheels but expanding just beyond
into an area large enough for a car to
turn upon though with no great space
to spare

  revolted by my position i shifted
into low gear and began cautiously to
circle the ancient shanty keeping as
close to it as i dared out of fear of
the swamp on the right suddenly i
discovered that i had hugged the
cabin too closely that i could not com-
plete the turn without backing up
going into reverse i let the car back

an inch at a time i had gone but a
few feet when there was a sort of
drop and the ear stopped i leaned
out to see what the trouble was and
noticed that the left rear wheel had
sunk rather deeply into the sod and in
doing so had acted like a lever on a
piece of board imbedded there i
tried to go ahead but the machine
refused to move then i climbed out
and studied the situation perhaps
if i could swing the board around in
line with the wheel i could make a
track sufficiently firm to pull out on
with that idea in mind i kicked the
trash from the slightly elevated end
and seizing it with both hands gave
it a sharp jerk it let go with a snap
and uttering a scream of horror i
fell back against the car there in a
cavity that the board had concealed
was visible the upper part of a human
body the face earth-strewn and dis-
coloied but still gruesomely familiar
with its blood-marked brow and di-
sheveled gray hair

  somehow i got the car free some-
how made my way over the bumpy
unused road to the main highway
the pavement lay straight as an ar-
rows path allead though just before
me it made an abrupt turn to the left
which way should i go ahead was
the road i had come should i take
that now i tried to consider but
before i could arrive at any con-
clusion something above the tree line
over at the left attracted my atten-
tion it was a slender white cross i
turned the car quickly in that direc-
tion and a few minutes later entered
a little town with a church close by
the highway

  a priest carrying a bag and an
extra coat was coming down the steps
t hailed him come with me -
quick i cried before the brakes
had stopped screeching i have just
found a dead body

  the man hesitated better get an
officer you see im-

    no you must come yourself-and
call an officer also  


weird tales

  at that he turned and ran toward
a near-by house a few minutes later
he climbed breathlessly in beside me
and we were leading a sizable proces-
sion back to the falling cabin

ayfy companion was the first to reach
the open grave one glance and
he turned a horror-stricken face to the
rest of us

     merciful heaven   he cried   this
is mrs drennan  

  in the midst of the excitement that
immediately burst forth someone sug-
gested better tell drennan and a
man went to perform the doleful task

  while the others were milling about
the crude grave the churchman
turned to me im glad he said
glad that you caught me when you
did the woman was one of my flock
and in another five minutes i should
have been gone for a three months
absence i had a very urgent tele-
gram at one oclock this morning

  by and by the messenger returned
and the crowd made silent way for
his companion

  i studied drennan curiously in the
brief moment of his approach he
was a youngish man with more than
an average share of good looks stal-
wart of figure and expensively ar-
rayed distorted as his face was with
emotion it was difficult to read any-
thing of the mans character there
but some of his minor traits were un-
mistakably recorded in the gorgeous
coloring of his hose and tie

  except for the heaving of his shoul-
ders and an occasional dry sob the
man stood quietly looking into the
grave until the priest took his arm
and drew him gently away

  i spoke to the churchman well
take him back with us i suggested
and fell in behind them

  arrived at the purple sedan the
priest was on the point of ushering
his companion inside when for the
first time the latter raised his head
he gave a sort of gasp and his face
already pale went blue-white he

dropped his eyes quickly and made as
if to turn round i would have
stopped him but the sheriff rushing
up excitedly interfered

  sorry drennan but of course you
ought to know heres the instru-
ment that did the deed-a flower vase
apparently we found it buried with
her

  see if it matches the one in my
car i interposed quickly

  the officer stared at me a moment
then reaching inside the sedan se-
cured my solitary vase he held the
two side by side while he studied
them

  a dead match he finally pro-
nounced then sternly to me   what
do you know about this   

  everything of importance it
seems  

  what for instance

  	 briefly that some time during the
afternoon of december sixth jasper
drennan killed his wife with a flower
vase and not later than five oclock
of the same day buried her here be-
hind the cabin

  but that is impossible in the
dead silence that followed my state-
ment only the priest found his voice

  according to the newspapers yes
but in reality mr drennan met his
wife at sanford that morning three
months ago just as they had planned
though because of the earliness of the
hour-the train reaches sanford at
five-thirty as i happen to know-and
the womans inconspicuous appear-
ance it is likely that no one noticed
them a probability that the man
seized upon when he was later faced
with the necessity of making explana-
tions then too the womans un-
obtrusiveness while traveling a habit
with which the husband was doubtless
familiar helped a great deal to lend
plausibility to his story as for the
muider itself it is not likely that the
idea ever occurred to him until in a
burst of anger the crime was com-
mitted - we have noticed that he
doesnt have any great control over
the purple sedan



his emotions at least no premedita-
tion is apparent relative to his wifes
money for as her manager and
eventual heir he was already sitting
pretty there but be that as it may
the killing in all probability didnt
take place until some time in the
afternoon when the heavy downpour
of rain made the road practically
deserted and it is reasonable to sup-
pose that it occurred not far from this
spot for a murderer would hardly
dare to carry his victims body any
great distance on a public highway in
broad daylight even in a rainstorm
and he must have made the burial in
the rain for he was wringing wet
when he stored his ear in a west park
garage at ten oclock that night-you
can see the prints of his wet clothes
on the upholstery yet as it takes at
least six hours of the wildest kind of
driving to cover the distance between
here and west park his gruesome
work must have been done by four
oclock especially as he had to lose a
little time when he stopped to tele-
phone his pretended inquiry concern-
ing his wife that was late in the
afternoon according to the papers
and it isnt likely he risked it before

ridding himself of the body-

  see here woman that is all guess-
work you cant charge a man with a
crime on such grounds it was the
priest who cut in

  is the vase guesswork it was
missing from the car it fits the
womans wounds it was found buried

with her-

  but its your ear it belongs in
what has this man to do with your
ear the sheriff demanded

  it was his car on the sixth of
december the day his wife disap-
peared he bought it the day before
in jacksonville i opened my bag
and offered the documents in proof of
my words the sheriff stared at the
uppermost paper then he turned
abruptly to drennan how about
it drennan he asked

  the man seemed remarkably calm
now but hisvoice was tense i did
own the car on that date but while i
was waiting for my wife somebody
drove it away

  and you knew exactly where to
find it a month later when you wanted
to trade it for a light sport roadster
but never mind about that were
all interested in another point would
you mind telling us what the quarrel
was about that caused you to kill your
wife-and throw her body into the
tonneau of the car could it by any
chance have been that she objected to
the color scheme of the purple sedan   
the mans nerves suddenly let go
you devil you fiend   he screamed
she told you that

  no i told him i merely de-
duced it from your clothes

  as the sheriff led his prisoner away
i turned to the shaken priest
fattier i said just to make sure
i suppose youll take charge of the
body  

  he nodded sadly when the time
comes  

  thanks

  a feeling of peace descended upon
me as i entered the purple sedan and
i have driven the car in peace ever
since

a marlow the murderers touch

one of the most fixed of all
beliefs in centuries past was
that the corpse of a murdered
man would bleed if his assassin came
near him or touched him a famous
instance of a trial by this practise is
found in denmark in the sixteenth
century a number of gentlemen
who were in an inn together one eve-
ning fell into a quarrel and from
words came to blows the candles
were overturned and in the darkness
a man was stabbed to death several
of the party accused an equerry of
the king as the murderer but he
stoutly denied it

  christian ii the king to discover
the murderer caused them all to be
assembled in a room around the dead
body as it lay on a bier and he or-
dered that one after another they
should lay their right hands on the
dead mans naked breast and swear
their innocence the gentlemen did
so and no sign appeared as witness
against them but the equerry hold-
ing off until the last and pretending
great grief first kissed the dead mans
feet then as he laid his hand on the
breast the blood gushed forth in
abundance not only from the dagger-
wound but also from the nostrils of
the corpse with a great cry of fear
the guilty man fell on his knees and
confessed his crime

  hereupon says an old chron-
icler arose that practise which is

now ordinary in many places of find-
ing out unknown murderers which
by the admirable power of cod are
for the most part revealed either by
the bleeding of the corpse or the open-
ing of its eyes or some other extraor-
dinary sign as daily experience
teaches  

  on another occasion a traveler was
found murdered on the highway in
denmark and the murderer being
unknown the magistrates caused one
hand of the victim to be eut off and
hung by a string to the ceiling of the
office of the town prison where as
months and years passed it dried and
shriveled

  ten years had gone by when one
day a well-known citizen entered the
prison on business as he spoke to
the jailor those in the room heard a
dripping sound and looking up saw
to their horror that drops of blood
were falling from the withered hand
to the table beneath it

  for a moment they all gazed
breathless with stupefaction then
the jailor sprang to his feet and
seized the visitor by the collar

  you are my prisoner he said
hoarsely limp with terror the mans
legs sagged beneath him he was
dragged before a magistrate where he

	into the infinite

standing at the controls his
tireless metal figure erect as he
gazed out into the vast black-
ness of cosmic space that lay before
us korus kan turned from that gaze
toward me as i stepped inside the
pilot room silently i stepped over
beside him and silently as was our
wont we contemplated the great pan-
orama before us a stupendous vault
of sheer utter darkness it stretched
about us darkness broken only by the
misty light of the great universes of
thronging suns that floated here and

there in this vast void through which
we were racing behind us our own
galaxy lay just another of those dim
glows for hours had passed since we
had launched out into outer space
from its edge and in those hours our
awful speed had carried us on through
the void through thousands of light-
years of space

  but though in those hours of flight
our own universe had dwindled to a
mere mist of light those other misty
patches that were the universes ahead
had hardly grown at all in size or in-
tensity of light making us realize that
even the vast expanse of space
through which our ship had already
flashed was but a fraction of the gulf
that lay between us and the great
andromeda universe before us the
soft glow that was that universe
seemed a little brighter a little
larger but even so i knew that more
than a score of days must elapse be-

fore even our ships tremendous
velocity would bring us to it and
even were we able to secure the help
we needed it would still be many
days before we could flash back to our
own galaxy and in those days i well
knew the serpent-invaders would be
completing their last plans tightening
their grip on all the suns and worlds
of the cancer cluster and preparing
the way for the vast hordes that soon
would cross the void to pour down on
that cluster spreading resistlessly
from it across all our galaxy

  it was with heavy heart that i
gazed ahead knowing these things
but my gloomy thoughts were sud-
denly interrupted by an exclamation
from korus kan who had been peer-
ing intently forward into the tene-
brous void and who now pointed
ahead toward the right

  that flicker of light he said
you see it

  i bent forward gazing to where he
was pointing in the heavens before us
and then at last made out in the black-
ness not far to the right of the glow-
ing andromeda universe another
patch of light of equal size but one
whose light was so dim as only to be
seen with straining eyes a mere dim
flicker of light it was in that crowd- 
ing darkness but as i gazed at it the
nature of it suddenly came clearly to
my mind and i uttered a low ex-
clamation myself

  the universe of the serpent-
ereatures i said its the dying
universe from which they came to in-
vade our own  

  he nodded yes its nearer the
andromeda universe than our own
too  

  i saw that he was right and that
the two universes that of andromeda
and this dim dying one lay com-
paratively close to each other and at
almost equal distances from our own
the two forming the base of a long
narrow triangle of which our own
universe was the apex together we

gazed toward that dim flicker of light
in a thoughtful silence we knew
even as we gazed what great prepara-
tions were going on in that dying
universe for the conquest of our own
galaxy what mighty efforts the ser-
pent-races there were making to com-
plete their vast fleet and the strange
huge weapon which the records we
had captured had mentioned so that
they could flash through the void to
pour down on our galaxy the knowl-
edge held us wrapped in thought as
our great ship raced on still holding
to its tremendous utmost velocity
rocking and swaying a little as it
plunged through the vast ether-cur-
rents which swirled about us here in
outer space

  gradually as we two stood in silence
with our great craft speeding on i be-
came aware that during the last few
minutes the air inside the pilot room
had become perceptibly warmer and
that its warmth was still increasing
i glanced at the dial that registered
the output of our heat-generators but
it was steady at its accustomed posi-
tion  yet with each moment the
warmth was increasing until within
a few minutes more the heat about us
had become decidedly uncomfortable
korus kan too had noticed it and
had now swung backward the control
of the heat-generators yet still the
warmth increased the heated air in
the pilot room rapidly becoming un-
bearable i turned to the antarian
fully alarmed now but as i did so the
door snapped open and jhul din
burst up into the pilot room

  whats happening to the ship
he cried its inner walls are getting
almost too hot to touch  

  in stunned surprize we gazed at
each other our heating-mechanisms
turned completely off now yet the in-
side-temperature dials arrow was still
moving steadily forward the thing
was beyond all reason we knew and
for an instant we stood in amazement
the heat increasing still about us
outside the universe



then suddenly jliul din pointed up-
ward toward the massed dials above
the controls his arm quivering

  look he cried the outside-
temperature dial  

  swiftly we raised our own eyes to-
ward it the dial upon which was
shown the temperature outside the
ship it should have shown absolute
zero we knew as always in the in-
finite cold of empty space but now
it did not and our eyes widened as
we stared at it in utter astonishment
and fear for it registered a tem-
perature of thousands of degrees in
the empty void about us

  heat i cried heat in empty
outer space its unthinkable  

  unthinkable it was yet even as we
stood and stared the arrow on the
outside-temperatiue was still creeping
steadily forward showing a swiftly
increasing heat outside while the air
inside had become all but unbreath-
able parching to the lungs at the
same moment a faint light began to
appear about us a dim red glow that
was intensifying with each moment
that we  raced onward and as we
wheeled toward the windows we saw
in the blackness of space before us a
great faintly glowing region of red
light ahead stretching across the
heaven before us ever stronger that
crimson glow was growing as we raced
on the heat about us mounting with
it and from beneath came the cries of
fear of our crew as they too glimpsed
the awful region of heat and light
through which we now were racing

  i knew that not much longer could
the heat about us increase thus if our
ship and ourselves were to survive
yet steadily the arrows on the tem-
perature-dials were moving forward
and as more and more of the awful
heat outside penetrated through the
insulation of our heat-resistant walls
i felt my brain turning dizzily saw
big jhul din stagger and sway against
the wall and saw korus kan the
heat penetrating through his metal
body even more than through our own

slumping sidewise across the controls
as he was overcome by it only half
conscious i sprang to his side de-
spite my own dizziness and parching
throat and lungs grasped the controls
and held our ship straight onward
since all about us the vast glow of
crimson light and heat stretched en-
circling us and beating upon us as we
flashed onward no flame there was
nor incandescent gas nor solid burn-
ing matter of any kind nothing but
a titanic region of brilliant crimson
light without visible source of any
kind glowing with terrific heat there
in the emptiness of outer space

the glow about us was becoming
more brilliant with each moment
that we raced on and as the heat out-
side and inside increased still more i
saw jhul din fling open the pilot
rooms door in a vain search for cooler
air heard from beneath a rumbling
ominous thumping and cracking as
our heat-seared walls began to warp in
the terrrible temperature to which they
were being subjected far ahead in the
awful region of heat and light through
which we were speeding i glimpsed
now a deeper spot of crimson light in
the great red glow and as we raced
on toward it i saw that it was the cen-
ter of all the gieat outpouring of red
light and of heat since it was all but
blinding in its brilliance while our
dials showed a temperature mounting
each moment that we neared it

  its the center of the whole
thing cried jhul din staggering
toward me and then slumping down
to the floor overcome keep the
ship clear of it he shouted collaps-
ing as he did so while beside me i
saw korus kan completely uncon-
scious neither the great crustacean
spican nor the metal-bodied anta-
rian possessing my own resistance to
the heat that now was smothering us
though i too knew that not much
longer could i hold to the controls

  hold to them i did though but
half conscious now myself then as

weird tales

there flamed dead ahead the heart of
the whole great inferno a blazing area
of brilliant crimson light that dazzled
me its terrific heat pouring full down
upon our plunging ship i swung the
controls sidewise swerving our craft
to the left and around the great heat-
regions fiery heart along its side
we flashed our ship plunging and
reeling now as it shot through ether-
eurrents that must have been of un-
paralleled size and speed but even in
that darkness that was stealing over
my senses i could see that in that hell
of light and heat to our right there
was still no core of matter nothing
but light and heat and space full
beside us it flamed as we shot past it
our rocking ships sides still grating
and cracking terribly beneath the
heat that beat upon them racing past
that awful glare of crimson light and
heat that was like a colossal forge at
which some mighty workman beat out
flaming suns blazing in terrific inten-
sity and dimensions there in the void
between universes

  on we raced while i strove with all
my waning strength to hold the ship
bucking and swaying as it was clear
of the fiery inferno to our right and
then it was dropping behind the bril-
liant crimson light and terrible heat
about us lessening a little as we shot
by it moments more and it had
dwindled to a deeper spot of light in
the great red-glowing region to our
rear and then as we flashed still on-
ward at our utmost speed the last of
the light and heat about us were pass-
ing  so that a moment later with heat-
mechanisms again switched on we
were flashing again through the cold
black void as before with the passing
of the overpowering heat the cracking
of the ships sides had ceased and ko-
rus kan and jhul din were stagger-
ing to their feet consciousness return-
ing with the cooler air together we
stared back to where only a swiftly
vanishing little glow of faint red
light in the darkness behind gave evi-

dence of the hell of heat and light
through which we had just come

  heat and light in the void of
outer space i cried the things
impossible-and yet we came through
it

  korus kan had been gazing back
with us but now he turned at my ex-
clamation shook his head not im-
possible he said quickly that
heat and that light we came through
were not generated like the usual
heat and light of burning suns-they
were generated in empty space by the
ether itself and as we stared
blankly at him he quickly explained
himself you know that heat and
light are but vibrations of the ether
of various frequencies just as are
radio-active or chemical rays and the
electro-magnetic waves we use for
speech and signaling highest of all
in frequency are those electro-mag-
netic waves next in order of fre-
quency come heat waves next the red
light vibrations and down the vari-
ous colors of light to the lower-fre-
quency violet light vibrations and
below these lowest of all the radio-
active or chemical rays well our
scientists have long known that va-
rious of these ether-vibrations have
been set up in the ether of outside
space by the collision of great ether-
currents by those collisions are
formed sometimes electro-magnetic
vibrations interfering with our
speech-vibrations as static or some-
times light-vibrations glowing with-
out visible source in the heavens and
known to us as the zodiacal light
here in the void though where
mighty currents of size and speed
inconceivable must collide the vibra-
tions set up were in the frequency-
range of heat and of the lower adjoin-
ing frequency that of red light so
that that region we came through is
one where the immense ether-eurrents
that we plunged through collide and
set up a ceaseless outpouring of heat
and light waves there in the ether in
empty space itself
outside the universe



   i shook my head it seems plau-
 sible i said yet the reality of it-
 that titanic region of awful heat and

light-

   it seems strange enough he ad-
 mitted but its really no stranger
 than if it had been a gieat region of

static or-

  a sharp cry from the spican
stabbed through our talk the
walls he shouted theyre be-
ginning to glow-look-

   startled we swung about and then
 the blood drove from my heart at the
 strangeness and awfulness of what we
 saw for engrossed in our talk we
 had not noticed that all in the pilot
 room about us walls and floor and
 mechanism and controls was begin-
 ning to shine out with a strange flick-
 ering luminosity a misty fluorescent
 light that with each moment wras wax-
 ing in intensity a quivering unfamil-
 iar light that seemed to glow from all
 in our ship as it raced swaying on
 though outside was nothing but the
 same blackness of space as before
 even as we stared about us astound-
 ed our own bodies and especially the
 metal body of korus kan had begun
 to radiate the same lambent light and
 then with a sudden great leap of my
 heart i saw that the edges and cor-
 ners of the walls about us were
 smoothing and rounding a little
 crumbling and disappearing a little
 as though slowly disintegrating at
 the same moment a strange tingling
 shook through every atom of my
 body a quivering force that flooded
  through me with increasing intensity
 horror-stricken we stood until
 from one of the levers beside me an
 inch of the handle fell off a little
 piece of metal that rattled to the floor
 and that wras crumbling slowly dis-
 integrating even as did the lever from
 which it had crumbled off then
 korus kan was leaping toward me
 across the glowing pilot room

  swerve the ships course he
 cried wildly  weve run into anoth-
 er great region of vibrations-radio-

 active vibrations that will crumble the
 ship and all in it to pieces in a few
 more moments

  i grasped the shining levers swung
them sharply sidewise sent our craft
flashing off at a broad angle to its
previous course but still about us the
glowing light waxed and deepened
and i felt an infinite nausea overcom-
ing me as through my body surged the
floods of radio-active vibrations from
the ether about us that had caused all
matter in our ship to radiate that
misty light with each moment the
shining walls about us seemed crum-
bling faster and i knew that moments
more would see the ships end unless
soon we escaped from the great trap
of disintegrating death into which we
had ventured i felt too that not for
long could we ourselves stand the im-
pact of these disintegrating vibra-
tions felt the tingling that shook my
own glowing flesh increasing in in-
tensity while all about us now tiny
bits of metal were falling from crum-
bling wralls and ceiling and machinery

  still grasping the controls though
i held the ship to a course aslant from
our previous one while my two com-
panions tensed with me over them
gazing ahead while from beneath
again came wild cries of alarm as
those of our crew who had already
run the gantlet of the enemies death-
beams and of the great heat-region
saw the new peril that encompassed
us there came too from somewhere
in the ship a great thump and clang
of metal as some one of our mechan-
isms there broke loose from its crum-
bling base but still we flung onward
through the void rocking and twist-
ing and in a moment the terrible
tenseness that gripped us lessened a
little as we saw that the glowing of
the walls about us and of our own
bodies was beginning to wane as we
drew out of the zone of deadly force
a few more moments of onward flight
and they had vanished altogether and
then i brought the ship back to its
course heading once more toward the


weird tales

misty light-patch of the andromeda
universe while i drew a long breath
of relief

phere was a silence of moments be-
-i -fore jhul din first of us found
his voice heat regions and radio-
active force regions he exclaimed
  if more of them lie between us and
the andromeda universe whats our
chance of getting there   

  korus kan shook his head well
get there   he said   but we  have to
keep close watch every moment of our
flight-theres no way of telling how
thickly scattered these great vibra-
tion-regions may lie in space about
us  

  a moment more and jhul din left
us passing down into the ships body
to ascertain what damage had been
wrought by the great zone of radio-
active force though we knew that we
had escaped from it before it could
seriously damage the ship and as i
now relinquished the controls to
korus kan pausing with him a mo-
ment to look out again with some fear-
fulness into the black void through
which we were racing it was with a
full realization at last of the tre-
mendous perils and unguessed cir-
cumstances that might lie in the vast
spaces through which we must yet
flash yet as my eyes fell again on the
misty-glowing circle of the androm-
eda universe and the sinister dimly
flickering mass of the dying universe
of the serpent-people to its right i
felt my determination steeling again
within me

  it was the sight of those two far
patches of light ahead i think that
held us all to our purpose in the
hours the days that followed long
strange days they were when with no
sun whatever near us we could meas-
ure time only by the great abysses of
space through which our ship was
steadily flashing computing from
those distances and from our unvary-
ing velocity the passing of the hours
but with each day with each hour we

were racing countless billions of miles
nearer toward the andromeda uni-
verse and toward the goal of our
tremendous journey on and on we
plunged our prow turned ever toward
that misty circle of light ahead that
was largening and brightening with
each hour that we sped toward it

  thrice in those following days we
glimpsed great regions of heat and
crimson light like that through which
we first had plunged and each time
we were able to swerve away from
them and detour around them in time
and so escaped a renewal of our first
dread experience of them more than
once too our instruments gave us
warning of zones of radio-active or
electrical force near us and these we
gave even a wider berth than the heat-
regions for these we feared most of
all i think ether-currents and vast
ether-maelstroms were aboutus too
we knew but the tremendous speed
of our craft brought us flashing
through those where a slower-moving
ship would have perished

  as it was one danger that had
menaced us always in navigation in-
side the galaxy the presence of me-
teors and meteor-swarms was lack-
ing in our flight yet i think
that almost we would have wel-
comed their presence about us for
all their danger if only for the
knowledge that some other matter
besides our ship moved and existed
in the mighty void around us it was
our ships isolation the knowledge
that all about it for countless billions
upon billions of miles thousands upon
tens of thousands of light-years there
stretched only the awful regions of
empty space an ocean of lightless
space in which the galaxies of flaring
suns here and there were but tiny
islands that oppiessed us most far
behind lay our own galaxy and far
ahead the andromeda imiverse and
between universe and universe an in-
finitesimal ly tiny speck there in the
mighty void our ship raced on and
on
outside the universe



  but as we added day after meas-
ured day to our flight as we flashed
nearer and nearer toward the an-
dromeda universe it slowly began to
change before us to wax from a little
patch of glowing light to a larger and
brighter patch and then to a great
oval of light that flamed brilliant in
the blackness of space before us and
finally to a vast disk-shaped mass of
stars like our own universe the disk
mass lay in space with edge toward
us and seen thus the light of its
countless thronging stars was fused
almost into a single waxing glow but
as we swept nearer and nearer that
glow began to resolve itself into the
light of the myriad massed suns of
which it was composed so brightly
flamed those gathering suns in the
heavens before us that only with an
effort could we make out far toward
the right the still faint glow of the
dying universe of the serpent-people
as near to us almost as that of an-
dromeda yet infinitely dim and dead
in comparison with it

steadily we flashed on day follow-
ing day until when a score of them
had passed we computed ourselves as
having traversed two-thirds of our
journey and could see that ever more
swiftly the great universe of stars
ahead was widening across the
heavens on that twentieth day i
spent hours with jhul din in our reg-
ular inspection of the ships mech-
anism passing with him through the
long room where our engineers de-
pleted in number by the death-beam
that had sliced through our ship
tended carefully the mighty gener-
ators then the spican and i passed
out of the room and were proceeding
down the long corridor that led to-
ward the pilot room when there came
suddenly from it ahead of us a sharp
cry

  we stopped short a moment then
raced down the corridor and burst up
into the pilot room where korus kan

turned swiftly from the controls to-
ward us

 ships are approaching from
ahead he cried pointing up toward
the big space-chart

  we looked and saw that even as
he had said there moved upon that
chart a half-hundred black dots in
close formation creeping steadily
downward across the blank chart to
meet the upward-creeping dot that
was our ship in silent amazement we
watched as our craft raced on and
then saw that as we neared them the
fifty ships ahead were slowly halting
and then beginning to move back to-
ward the andromeda universe in the
same direction as ourselves they
were allowing us to slowly overtake
them obviously intending to race be-
side us at the same speed as ourselves
toward the andromeda universe and
as they made that move jhul din
uttered an exclamation

    they must be ships from the an-
dromeda universe itself he cried
theyve learned of our approach by
space-charts of some kind-have come
out to meet us 

  my heart leapt at the thought for
if it were so it would mean the first
success of our mission across the void
silently we watched as our ships
single dot on the chart raced closer
and closer toward the half-hundied
dots above it they moving now at a
speed almost equal to our own with-
in moments we would be able to
glimpse them we knew and gazed
tensely into the blackness of space
ahead toward the andromeda uni-
verses flaring suns as our craft
raced on moments were passing
tense moments of silence and watch-
fulness and then far ahead we
glimpsed in the void hardly to be
seen against the great glow of the
andromeda universe a little mass of
light-points that steadily were largen-
ing as we gradually overtook them

  a full fifty of them in sight they
were flashing on in a close formation


weird tales

allowing us to overhaul them chang-
ing from mere light-points into dark
vaguely glimpsed shapes as we drove
nearer toward them then at last we
had reached them were driving in
among them as they moved now at
the same speed as ourselves could see
their shapes more clearly as long and
oval their front ends white-lit trans-
parent-walled rooms like our own
nearer we were flashing to those be-
fore us and about us and then in
those white-lit control rooms i
glimpsed their occupants slender
writhing pale shapes at sight of which
 cried aloud

  serpent-ships i cried ser-
pent-ships from the dying universe
ahead those back in our galaxy
from whom we escaped have warned
them of our coming by the means of
etheric communication their records
mentioned-they know our mission
and theyve come out to intercept us
here in space

  even as i cried out koras kans
hands flashed out to the controls but
he was an instant too late for at
that same moment the ships just be-
fore us had turned and circled in one
swift movement and were rushing
straight back toward us i had a
flashing glimpse of their white-lit
prows racing toward us through the
intense darkness and saw with photo-
graphic clearness the slender serpent-
shapes in those brilliantly lit pilot
rooms and then the foremost ship
loomed suddenly enormous as it
flashed straight toward us with a
sharp cry korus kan drove the con-
trols sidewise to swerve our ship but
before we could avoid the onrushing
craft ahead it was upon us and with
a terrific thunderous shock had
crashed straight into our own racing
ship

	the gates of a universe

 think now that it was only that
last jerking aside of the controls
by korus kan that saved us from
utter annihilation in that moment

for as he moved them our ship
swerved sidewise not enough to avoid
the collision but enough to cause the
onrushing ship to strike our own
obliquely along the side instead of
head on and it was that alone that
saved us the crash shook our great
craft like a leaf in a gale trembling
and reeling there in the black gulf
of space and flinging us all to the
pilot rooms floor and for a moment
it seemed to us that our ship had
been riven apart then as it steadied
we scrambled to our feet just in time
to see the ship that had crashed into
us reeling away to the side a shat-
tered mass of metal while down upon
us from above and all about the other
serpent-ships were swooping

  as korus kan sprang back to the
controls i leapt to the order-tube
was on the point of shouting a com-
mand to our crew beneath when
down from the hovering ships above
us there dropped around us a dozen
or more of great flexible ropes or
loops of gleaming metal that en-
circled our ship like great snares
within another instant our craft had
been drawn upward by them until it
lay securely lashed between two of
the enemy ships our ray-tubes useless
now since to loose them was but to
perish with the ships that held us
then another ship was slanting down
above us and as it hung over us
there projected downward from its
lower space-door toward our own
upper space-door a hollow tube of
metal of the same diameter as the
two space-doors that attached itself
with a click to our own upper door
forming a hermetically sealed gang-
way there between our two ships in
space

  until that moment we had stood
motionless in amazement somewhat
stunned by the suddenness of our
ships capture then as the space-door
of our ship clanged open above i
uttered a cry sprang out into the
corridor that ran the ships length
and saw the members of our crew
outside the universe



bursting into that corridor in answer
to my cry even as from the space-
door chamber beside it there writhed
out a horde of scores of the serpent-
creatures jhul din and korus kan
were beside me now and with shouts
of fierce anger we rushed upon the
masses of serpent-creatures who still
were pouring down from the ship
above through the hollow gangway

  the melee that followed was wilder
than when we ourselves had captured
this same ship since though we and
all our crew flung ourselves forward
upon the things without hesitation
we were weaponless and outnumbered
by ten to one as it was i struck out
with all my power at the hideous
writhing beings feeling some of them
collapse beneath my wild blows even
as they strove to coil about me saw
korus kan with his triple powerful
metal arms crushing the life from
those who leapt upon him cool and
silent as ever even in that wild din of
battle glimpsed the great spican
grasping those about him in his tre-
mendous arms and literally tearing
them into fragments as we battled on
but rapidly the members of our crew
who battled about us were going down
the life crushed from them by the
coiling bodies that overwhelmed us
and then as i strode on i too was
gripped from beneath by a serpent-
creature that had wound itself about
my feet and now pulled me down

  struggling in the grip of a half-
dozen of the alien creatures i heard
jhul din shouting hoarsely saw him
finally pulled from his feet also by a
great mass of the writhing things
and then korus kan and the re-
mainder of our crew were overcome
too and within another moment all
was over scores of the serpent-crea-
tures lay dead about us but with
them lay many of our own crew not
more than a bare score were left to
us now of all our party gripped
tightly still by the serpent-creatures
we were thrust down a narrow stair
and into an empty little storeroom

beneath the pilot room in its metal
walls but a single space-window
giving a view forward the door
snapped shut as the last of us were
thrust inside and then our captors
had left us the lashings that had
snared our ship were cast loose by
the ships on either side and as the
humming of the generators waxed
loud again our ship and those about
it began to move once more through
space

  theyre heading now toward the
dying universe exclaimed korus
kan gazing through the single win-
dow into the black gulf outside
theyre going to take us there as
prisoners

  but i too gazing through the win-
dow at his side had seen that our
ships prow was turning now toward
the right so that ahead now instead of
the great glowing mass of the an-
dromeda universe there lay the dim
faintly glowing patch of light that
was the serpent-peoples waning uni-
verse toward it now our ship and
the ships about us were flashing at
greater and greater speed and as
they hummed on the despair that had
already gripped me deepened it was
not the peril in which we ourselves
lay that affected me for well i knew
that from the moment of our capture
our fate had been sealed and that
our temporary reprieve from death
meant only that some more horrible
fate awaited us in the dying universe
it was that the last chance of our
own universe had vanished with our
capture the last hope to summon
from the andromeda universe the
help that could save our galaxy gone
now forever

  in a silence of utter despair i
gazed ahead as our ship and those
about it hummed on while jhul din
and korus kan and all the survivors
of our crew prisoned with us main-
tained the same despairing silence

ning clear of the room that was our
prison not to speak of overcoming
the hordes of serpent-creatures who
now operated our ship in a strange
apathy of spirit we sat and stood
hour after hour speaking little our
eyes and minds turned only to the
window through which we could see
in the black abyss of space ahead
the faintly glowing universe of the
serpent-people broadening slowly
ahead as our ships raced on at full
speed toward it

a day passed and that dying uni-
verse had grown across a full
third of the vault of space before us
a great dim-glowing region of flicker-
ing luminescence utterly different
from the radiance of the shining
andromeda universe that lay now
far to our left on and on the ser-
pent-ships raced unceasingly hour
upon hour until at last on the third
day of our imprisonment their speed
began to slacken the drone of the
great generators falling a little in
pitch as they drew near at last to
their galaxy that had expanded out-
ward now until it seemed to fill all
the heavens before us so strange a
spectacle to our eyes that almost
we forgot our own predicament and
despair in contemplation of it

  full in the heavens before us it
lay a mighty galaxy fully as large as
our own as the andromeda universe
but infinitely different a galaxy not
of life but of death in all its mighty
mass were no flaming white or blue
or yellow suns like those of our own
galaxy no brilliant young stars sur-
rounded by circling sun-warmed
worlds here was only a vast forest
of dead and dying suns stretched
across the heavens huge throngs of
dark burned-out stars cold and black
and barren that crowded thick upon
one another with here and there a
few dying suns of dark smoky red
somber crimson stars in the last
stages of stellar evolution it was
with the light of these few alone

 that the great mass faintly glowed
 an expiring universe in which all
 light and life were sinking into dark-
 ness and death

   silent with awe and wonder we
 watched as our ships drove in toward
 this darkening galaxy and then i
 began to make out between us and it
 a strange constant flicker of blue
 light that seemed to extend all about
 the faint-glowing universe before us
 stronger that flicker was growing as
 we sped on toward it though through
 it there shone clearly as ever the
 light of the crimson suns beyond it
 at last we seemed racing straight
 into it and now i saw that it was a
 colossal globular shell of flickering
 blue light almost invisible that en-
 closed within itself all the mighty
 circular mass of the dying universe
 before us our ships seemed about
 to flash straight into it but now
 turned sharply to the left speeding
 along the great light-bnrriers edge
 a ship beside us though had turned
 a little too late and had struck the
 light-wall while turning and as it did
 so i saw it rebounding back with
 terrific force as though in collision
 with a solid wall its whole prow
 crumpled by the impact then at
 last i comprehended the nature of
 this vast shell of flickering blue light
 that enclosed the dying universe

    its a vibration-wall i cried to
 my companions a great wall of
 etheric vibrations enclosing all this
 universe  

   for i saw now that that was the
 great barriers nature it was a
 mighty shell of perpetual vibrations
 in the ether itself extending all about
 the universe before us allowing light
 and electro-magnetic communication
 waves to pass through it unchanged
 but excluding and holding out the
 vibrations of matter by meeting
 them as i knew must be the case
 with a vibration of equal frequency
 which opposed them reflected them
 back forming a barrier more impen-
 etrable than any of solid matter yet
outside the universe



one all but invisible extending about
all this mighty universe excluding
from it for all time all matter from
outside too as i was later to learn
the great vibration-wall was impen-
etrable to the heat-vibrations reflect-
ing those of its dying suns that
struck it back into the universe in-
side it was for this purpose that
the vast barrier had been erected as
the suns of the serpent-people failed
to prevent the escape of any of the
precious heat-radiations of their few
living suns and also to place about
all their universe a wall impenetrable
to all invaders set in the ether
about their universe eons before the
vibrations that made up the great
barrier were perpetual and undying
a vast wall of defense about the
serpent-universe

  we were flashing close along the
mighty flickering barriers edge
now and the speed of our ships
slackened swiftly as there loomed far
ahead in space two great dark bulks
starred here and there with points of
white light moments more and they
had grown to immense size as we
neared them and now we saw that
these were mighty square-walled
structures of gleaming metal each a
full five thousand feet in length along
each of its four sides and half again
that much in height two colossal
metal forts that floated motionless
there in space set directly in the
great wall of flickering blue vibra-
tions and between which there was
a great opening in that wall a clear
space in which was no flickering bar-
rier and which i divined was the
single opening in all the great wall
and flanking that opening on either
side hung the massive metal struc-
tures upheld there in the void as i
guessed by mighty generators like
those of our own ships castles of
metal whose countless deadly death-
beam tubes commanded the opening
between them and from whose white-
lit windows the serpent-garrisons of
them gazed out upon us great space-

forts hung there at the vibration-
walls one opening guarding the
gates of a universe 

  in toward the narrow opening be-
tween the great forts swept our
ships and as they moved slowly in-
ward there flashed a challenging
signal of lights from those forts an-
swered at once by similar signals
from our ships then we were driving
inward between the towering metal
castles on either side flashing in
through the great vibration-wall and
into the dying galaxy itself with
generators again humming at high
speed our half-hundred ships swept
on into the thronging thousands of
dead and dying suns that swarmed
before us inside the colossal protect-
ing shell of the great vibration-wall

  all about us now were great hordes
of swarming dark-stars that we could
but dimly glimpse as our ships
flashed between them vast throngs of
black and burned-out suns that out-
numbered the few still flaming stars
by hundreds to one here and there
about us though as we swept on
we could make out a red sun or
two some comparatively brilliant and
others so dark and far gone that they
seemed only like giant cooling embers
in the black heavens clusters there
were too of which all but one or
two suns would be black and dead
and as we flashed on into the depths
of this universe we began to realize
at last what tremendous necessity it
had been that had sent the serpent-
peoples driving out through the limit-
less void in search of a new universe

  far ahead though there loomed
before us as we sped on a trio of giant
crimson suns more brilliant than
any we had yet seen in this dying
universe and which hung at its
center each of them as large as great
canopus itself in our own galaxy
in a great triangle they hung there
two of them much brighter than the
other a mighty triplet of titanic
waning suns that seemed like the
dying monarehs of the vast and dying


weird tales

realm about them it was down to-
ward these three great suns that our
ships were slanting now down toward
the space at the center of their great
triangle and now we saw that in
that space there swung a single
mighty world a dark immense planet
of size inconceivable almost as large
as the three great suns at whose
center it turned and whose light and
heat fell perpetually upon it

broader and broader the great
turning world was growing as we
slanted down toward it until it lay
like a tremendous dark shield beneath
us filling all the heavens below as
our ships sank still lower toward it
speed swiftly slackening we began to
make out details on its surface to
make out what seemed to be a vast
mass of palely shining structures
towers and walls and vast terraced
buildings that glowed all with pale
blue light indescribably ghostly in
appearance as they soared into the
dusky crimson light of the three
encircling suns here and there
through the masses of these blue-
shining structures ran streets narrow
openings in which swarmed great
masses of the writhing serpent-people
and as i gazed down upon this
tremendous city upon the countless
glowing structures of pale blue light
that made it up my astonishment at
what i saw broke from me in a
startled cry

  this city i exclaimed its
buildings are of vibrations like the
great wall around their universe

  a city of vibrations a mighty
city that covered apparently all this
giant planet and yet whose every
structure was built not of matter
but of etheric-vibrations that were
matter-resistant like the great wall
vibrations infinitely more lasting and
impenetrable than any matter and
projected upward at will into build-
ings of any shape or size here and
there in the mighty city even as we
sped down over it we could see build-

ings vanishing instantaneously could
see other mighty buildings springing
as instantly into being all of the
same pale blue light reared or
destroyed instantly by snapping on
or off the vibrations that were pro-
jected upward to form them

  now as our ships slanted down
over the vast mass of pale-glowing-
structures that stretched from hori-
zon to horizon i saw that ahead and
beneath there lay amid those struc-
tures a mighty circular clearing
scores of miles in diameter and
paved smoothly with the same pale
blue force as the citys buildings
and streets in this vast circle
ranged regularly in long rows rested
thousands upon countless thousands
of gleaming oval space-ships in all
stages of completion over and among
them swarming ceaselessly through
them and toiling to complete them
moved mighty hordes of the serpent-
ereatures aimed with great tools of
strange design the thunderous clamor
of their work coming up to us
through the great planets air it
was the immense workshop of the
serpent-races that lay beneath us i
knew in which their hordes labored
ceaselessly to complete the mighty
fleet that was to cany them through
the void to our universe

  it was not the ranks of half-built
ships though nor the toiling throngs
among them that held our gaze in
the vast circular clearing over which
we were racing it was the colossal
shape that loomed at that clearings
center and that occupied fully half
the area of its vast circle a stupen-
dous metal cone-structure that rose in
the air before us for fully a score of
miles the diameter of its base almost
as great a gigantic smooth-sided
mountain of metal towering there
above the countless ships and workers
in the great clearing around it and
above the far-stretching city about
that clearing past its side our ships
were speeding and we could see now
that about it and upon it there
outside the universe



 labored other great masses of serpent-
 creatures swarming in and out of the
 heavy doors that swung open in its
 sides at various levels and lalwring
 upon the great masses of machinery
 that we could glimpse inside some
 of these we saw were great genera-
 tors like those of our ships making
 it clear that the vast cone was in-
  tended to race through space then
 as korus kans keen eyes peered to-
 ward and into its interior as we
 flashed past he turned toward us
 startled

   its a colossal death-beam pro-
 jector he exclaimed one that
 can move through space like their
 ships-and that can stab forth a
 death-beam of unthinkable size with
 that when they complete it they can
 wipe out all life on a whole world
 with a single flash of the stupendous
 beam

   stunned we gazed toward it as our
 ships flashed past the tremendous
 cone itself was apparently complete
 from vast base to the truncated
 flattened tip the generators that
 were to move it through space were
 apparently all installed and the
 great hordes of serpent-workers who
 swarmed in it now were beginning
 to place in it the massed mechanisms
 for the production of the colossal
 death-beam whieh would be pro-
 jected up through a tremendous hol-
 low tube or tunnel running up from
 the great cones interior to the great
 round opening at its truncated tip
 the terrific beam generated in that
 interior would flash out of that open-
 ing at the top in whatever direction
 the vast cone itself was headed in
 space would flash through space with
 its tremendous power for immense
 distances spreading out fanwise and
 expanding in every direction as it
 flashed on until it struck the planet
 at which it was aimed enveloping
 all that planet in its ghostly glow and
 wiping out instantly all life upon it
 this then was the great weapon of
 irresistible power which the captured

records of the serpent-ereatures had
mentioned and irresistible it was
i saw now for with it when com-
pleted the serpent-ereatures could
sally foith and with one sweep of
the colossal beam destroy all fleets of
space-ships opposing them by anni-
hilating their crews could descend
upon our universe and with that
same great beam wipe out all life
upon world after world of our galaxy
swiftly resistlessly until in all our
universe was left no living thing
except themselves

  but now even as we stared in hor-
ror and amazement at the vast cone
our ships were driving past it still
over the great clearing filled with
close-ranked masses of the lialf-built
ships initil before and beneath us lay
the mighty circles edge and now
we saw that beyond it touching it
there lay another smaller circle of
clear space amid the vast citys
crowding structures of blue light a
circle from which throngs of space-
ships were constantly rising and upon
which others were descending it be-
ing obviously one of the points of
departure and arrival for all ships
down toward it our own ships were
speeding slower with every moment
until at last they had landed at this
smaller circles edge our own closest
to that edge the pale-glowing mighty
buildings towering up just beside us

  then the spaee-doors of our ships
were clanging open and their oc-
cupants were writhing forth from
them a moment and the door of
our prison snapped open then
herded forward by a half-dozen of
serpent-ereatures armed with small
death-beam tubes we were marched
out of the ship and onto the smooth
pavement of blue force that covered
this circle also there massed to-
gether we were halted for a moment
and took the opportunity to stare
about from the ships behind us just
landed the last of the serpent-crews
had writhed forth passing across to
a narrow street that opened through


weird tales

the mass of towering shimmering
buildings before us from the circular
clearings edge we ourselves were
being marched toward that street
now the great oval ships lying empty
and deserted behind us and at sight
of their open doors i turned and
twitched the arm of jhul din walk-
ing beside me

  its a chance in a million to get-
away i whispered to him and to
koras kan if we can overpower
these guards and get back inside our
ship-

  they turned toward me startled
and then as they glanced back toward
the deserted ships their eyes lit with
excitement a moment more and i
had whispered my plan glancing
toward the half-dozen guards behind
us and then the next moment we put
it into effect jhul din suddenly
slumping to the blue-force pavement
and lying motionless sprawled as
though suddenly stricken down it
was the most primitive of ruses and
i could only hope in that moment
that our guards might not have had
experience of it the next moment
though they had seen the motionless
form of the big spiean and with a
natural perplexity had writhed for-
ward toward it holding their beam-
tubes though gripped in the coils of
their strange bodies alertly toward
ourselves beside the big crustacean
they halted tubes trained still upon
us as they inspected him then the
next moment the spican had reached
out his great arms with inconceivable
swiftness and suddenness grasping
the serpent-guards beside him before
they could turn their tubes down
upon him -threshing with them in
sudden fierce battle as ave rushed
forward to aid him

 the next moment we were all
struggling there with those guards in
a wild melee their deadly tubes
knocked from their grasp by jhul din
in his leap upon them with the
strength and fury of despair we flung
ourselves upon them rending their

writhing bodies to fragments as they
sought to coil about us our hoarse
shouts rising above their own hissing
cries of fear and alarm in but a
moment it seemed we were crushing
the last of them beneath us jhul din
and one or two of our crew leaping
already toward the open door of our
ship while we staggered up to follow
but as we did so there came from
behind us other hissing cries and we
whirled about then stopped short
for back from the street into which
they had just gone were rushing the
serpent-crews of the ships behind us
a resistless horde that was flashing
upon us with the ghostly death-beams
of their tubes stabbing full toward
us

  	the hall of the living dead

racing forward as they were the
serpent-creatures rushing upon
us could only loose their death-beams
at chance upon us and it was that
alone that saved us the deadly rays
going wide except for one that struck
and annihilated two of our party in
its wild whirling then before they
could loose the beams again upon us
we had rushed forward to meet them
and were among them while at the
same moment i shouted hoarsely over
my shoulder to jhul din who with
his three followers had reached now
the open door of our ship behind us
and who now had hesitated for an
instant as he saw our new foes rush
down upon us

     go on jhul din   i cried   get
away in the ship-well hold them till
you get clear-

  then we were meeting the serpent-
creatures before us and the next
few moments we seemed surrounded
weighed down by a solid mass of
writhing bodies at which we struck
crazily with the last of our strength
even as we struggled wildly though
i heard above the shouts and hissing
cries about me the clang of the ships
space-doors the swift humming of its
generators then as i staggered clear
outside the universe



of my opponents for a moment i saw
the great craft with jhul din at the
controls in its pilot room lifting
suddenly from the clearing slanting
steeply upward at immense speed van-
ishing almost instantly in the crimson
sunlight above i yelled with exulta-
tion at the sight and then was pulled
down once more by my opponents
held tightly with korus kan and the
others as with wild hissing cries the
greater part of the serpent-creatures
rushed to their ships

  a moment more and two score of
their craft were shooting sharply up-
ward in hot pursuit of jhul din and
his fleeing ship held tightly by our
serpent-captors we waited with them
the return of the pursuing ships
would they catch the big spican
slowly the minutes dragged past
while in the gulf of space above us
we knew jhul din and his three
followers were racing twisting fight-
ing against that remorseless pursuit
that would track him by the space-
charts then at last after a wait
that seemed eternities in length the
dark long shapes of the ships that
had pursued him drove down from
above and landed beside us their
serpent-crews emerging but with-
out trace of jhul din or his ship
whether he had managed to elude
them and drive out between the great
space-forts into open space and
escape or whether he had met his
end beneath their death-beams we
could not say nor guess

  i knew though that they would
hardly have given up the pursuit un-
successfully so soon and it was with
doubt and fear in my heart that i rose
now in response to the motioned com-
mands of our captors guarding us
now with a score or more of death-
beam tubes they marched us across
the circle toward the street that
opened from it and then down that
streets length between the mighty
structures of blue force on either
side half-transparent as were those
buildings of pale blue light we could

see in them all the various floors and
levels as though in buildings of blue
glass and on those levels great ranks
of half-glimpsed mechanisms tended
by moving writhing throngs of ser-
pent-beings other throngs of them
moved about us in the narrow street
from building to building passing
and repassing around us as we
marched along

  to these though and to the build-
ings about us we paid but small at-
tention  for at the end of the narrow
street down which we were marching
there loomed a great blue-shining
structure of the same vibration as the
others but which dwarfed them by
its tremendous size its vast terraced
sides slanted up for level upon
mighty level and as we neared it we
saw that the street itself ended in it
passing through the high great door-
way before us into the shining struc-
tures interior in and out of it were
pouring hordes of the serpent-crea-
tures and into it we were marched
by our guards through the great
hall inside and on through a suc-
cession of other corridors in which
writhed serpent-throngs through
the open doors of the looms along
those corridors as we passed by
them i could see serpent-creatures
grouped about low desklike plat-
forms could see massed rows of great
mechanisms that seemed tabulating
or recording machines of some sort
saw other great rooms filled with flex-
ible metal rolls like those we had
captured with our oval ship great
collections of written records and
realized that this huge building must
hold within itself the central con-
trolling government of all the laces
of the serpent-creatures on this great
central world and on the worlds that
revolved about the few living suns in
the universe about us

  our captors halted us at last be-
fore a door heavily guarded by ser-
pent-creatures with ray-tubes and
while one of our own guards passed
through the door into the great rooms


weird tales

we could glimpse inside the remain-
der kept close watch upon us i
sensed that our own fate was being
decided in those rooms beside us and
a few moments later saw that my
guess had been right for there came
out the serpent-creature who had
gone in giving to our guards brief
hissing orders at once they marched
us onward emerging again into the
great central hall that ran through
the vast blue-shimmering building
and progressing with us down that
great crowded corridor until they
turned us sharply to the right
through a big open door into a mighty
hall or room the nature and purpose
of which we could not grasp for the
moment

  it was filled with great transpar-
ent cases ranged in long regular
rows extending from flickering blue-
light wall to wall of the vast hall in
those cases there were shapes and fig-
ures rigid and unmoving that had ap-
parently once been living things and
that were of a strangeness inconceiv-
able in hundreds in thousands
they were grouped there in the pro-
tecting cases beasts and beings all
but indescribable in appearance so
strange were they even to our eyes
which had seen all the countless forms
of life of our own galaxy there was
in a ease near us a vast flat thing
of white flesh disklike and scores of
feet in diameter with a single staring
eye at its center in another case was
a great many-legged cylinder of flesh
without discernible features what-
ever in still another just before us
a black powerful-looking insect-shape
that was apparently double-headed
with two sets of black beady eyes
all down the great halls length
stretched the rows of cases filled with
beings of which the sight of some
alone was a creeping horror and as
we gazed at that incredible collection
of alien forms in amazement its
significance rushed upon me

  its a museum i exclaimed
a great collection of the living

forms that have existed in this dying
universe-preserved here for count-
less ages perhaps out of the past

  as i spoke though there were
coming down toward us from the far
end of the great hall two serpent-
creatures who seemed the custodians
of this strange collection our guards
addressed to them a few hissing com-
mands and the two turned seemed
to survey the cases about them while
we stared in perplexity then one
turned toward a niche inset in the
wall in which rested two transparent
containers or tubes of liquid one of
bright red and the other of green and
a long slender metal needle that was
apparently a hypodermic of some
sort thrusting the needle into the
red liquid the serpent-creature hold-
ing it advanced to the case nearest
us which contained only the double-
headed insect-ereature he swung the
side of the case open and then with
a swift jab inserted the needle in
the body of the thing inside

  there was a moment of silence and
then to our amazement and horror
the insect-thing moved its eyes roving
from side to side its limbs twitching
the thing was alive the two ser-
pent-creatures stepped toward the
case as it came to life holding death-
beam tubes toward it and addressing
it in hissing tones apparently it was
of some intelligence for in response
to those orders it stepped outside the
case down the hall toward another
case which was all but filled by other
strange shapes into this it stepped
at the command of the two and then
the one with the needle filled it with
the green fluid and inserted this in
turn into the things body at once
that body stiffened ceased to move
the thing becoming as rigid and un-
lifelike in appearance as before its
eyes staring stonily ahead in all the
appearance of death

  horror filled me at the sight hor-
ror that sickened me for i saw now
that the things about us the count-
less strange shapes in these rows of
outside the universe



eases were all as alive and conscious
as ourselves their life and intel-
ligence unharmed but their bodies
thrown into a state of rigid suspended
animation by the insertion of the
green fluid into them a fluid that
must be like the poisons with which
some insects are able to keep their
captured prey alive and unmoving
indefinitely a fluid that suspended
all animation instantly and that could
only be neutralized by the injection
of the opposing red fluid though
always the victim remained conscious
and alive alive these myriad
alien shapes about us-rigid and
motionless yet living and conscious
living perhaps for ages in that
living death-my brain reeled at the
thought i turned to korus kan
sick with horror but then stopped
short stiffened for now the serpent-
creature grasping the metal needle
and the tube of green fluid was
coming toward us

  all the horror of the fate intended
for us burst across my brain in one
flash of awful comprehension then
and a strangled cry broke from me
  they re going to keep us here too  
i cried pointing with trembling
hand keep us here as strange
beings-in living death in this muse-
um of strange beings

a moment we stood in horror-
stricken silence and then as the
full awfulness of the thing reserved
for us penetrated the brains of my
companions they uttered a medley of
hoarse shouts of rage and horror and
as one leapt forward upon the ser-
pent-creatures with the fluid-tubes
and upon our guards

  i think that we expected no better
than death in that moment for the
death-beam tubes of the guards were
full upon us but i think too that we
all preferred a swift clean death to
the horror of living death that
awaited us in this museum of hell
but the very motive that made us
desire death prevented the guards

from loosing it upon us preferring to
follow their orders and place us in
the collection about us rather than
annihilate us por instead of loosing
the rays as we sprang they leapt to
meet us at the same time giving
utterance to loud hissing cries of
alarm

  our guards outnumbered us and
though we leapt upon them with all
the energy of horror and despair
striving to wtcst the death-tubes from
their grasp they coiled about and
held us while into the great hall
from the big corridor outside there
rushed in answer to their alarm other
scores of serpent-creatures leaping
likewise upon us wearied as we
were and outnumbered by five to one
our struggle though fierce was of
short duration and then we were
held completely by the creatures
about us while toward us again came
the two serpent-creatures with the
metal needle and two liquid-tubes
first toward me they came dipping
the needle into the green liquid and
then stabbing it into my arm

  i shrank deeply as the sharp needle
pierced my skin but the next moment
ceased to shrink as through me there
ran a wave of cold a flood of utter
iciness that held me motionless un-
able to move no muscle of mine
down to the smallest could i control
lying there staring straight ahead
unmoving unwinking unbrcathing
even my lungs my heart my blood
ail had stopped moving in the instant
that the poison flooded through me yet
my brain was as clear or clearer than
ever coldly clear as though attached
to it was no body whatever my
senses though still functioned and
though all power of motion had left
me i could still see and hear as
clearly as ever it was as though my
brain had been suddenly lifted from
the mass of flesh that was my body
and endowed with a strange lifeless
life of its own

  now the guards rose from me
leaving me lying motionless and rigid


weird tales

and turned toward koms kan who
was being held down by others his
metal body seemed to puzzle them for
an instant and then they solved the
problem by injecting the needle of
green fluid into the nerve-tissues at
the edge of his eyes from which it
would spread instantly to the other
living organs cased by his metal body
another moment and he too lay like
me rigid and powerless to move our
eyes meeting in an unchanging stony
stare within minutes more the green
fluid had been injected into the last
of our score of followers and we had
all become but rigid living statues
our consciousness and senses alone un-
affected then by the serpent-erea-
tures we were set into the transparent
case from which the double-headed
insect-thing had been moved to make
way for us were placed in a sitting
position with backs against the cases
sides and then it was closed and the
guards passed out of the big hall
leaving in it only the two serpent-
ereatures who were its custodians

  rigid unmoving unbreathing yet
with consciousness mind and senses
as clear as ever living brains eased
in bodies that were helpless and mo-
tionless i think that no position of
any in all time could have been more
terrible than ours had conscious-
ness been suspended also with the
powers of our bodies the captivity we
suffered would have been but a
dreamless sleep at least but to allow
our consciousness and intelligence to
remain our bodies severed from our
control-that was a torture that
surely none other could ever equal
statuelike we sat there while hour
followed hour gazing always in the
same direction with unmoving and
unwinking eyes certainly no wonder
would it have been had we gone mad
in the first hours of that ghastly
terrible imprisonment

  as the hours the days dragged
past though i bent all my mental
efforts toward the keeping of my
sanity and though at times my brain

reeled beneath our terrible pre-
dicament i desperately forced my
thoughts into other channels from
where i sat i could gaze out into the
great corridor outside the room and
that at least gave me something
moving to contemplate as through it
swept the never-ceasing hordes of
the serpent-people a rush of activity
that dwindled never until the rising
of the darkest of the three suns
marked the coming of the night the
sleep-period of the serpent-people
the light of that darker sun was so
far dimmer than that of the other two
that as this world turned between the
three one-third of each day was spent
in a dusky red darkness a strange
night in which all activity in the vast
serpent-city about us seemed to cease
only our rooms two serpent-guards
and some others here and there out-
side remaining alert our two room-
guards being replaced at the begin-
ning of each night by two others who
alternated with them in their duties

  it was these things alone though
the coming of night and the changing
of our guards the cessation and re-
commencement of the activity in the
corridor outside the waning and wax-
ing of the crimson light that fell
through the great buildings flicker-
ing blue vibration-walls that alone
marked for us the passage of time
day was following day while we sat
on there in living death unmoving as
stones and i knew that with each
day the great fleet of the serpent-
ereatures i had glimpsed in the clear-
ing would be approaching nearer to
completion as would the colossal
death-beam cone with which they
meant to wipe out all the races of all
the galaxys worlds and we on
whom had rested the one chance of
our universe had failed-we were
prisoners i could not believe that
jhul din with his two or three fol-
lowers had managed to get through
the great vibration-wall about this
universe and speed to the andromeda
universe for help our last hope
outside the universe



was gone and the last hope of our
galaxy with it prisoned as we were
in the helpless flesh of our own bodies
from which there could be no escape
lacking even the power to destroy
ourselves and end our endless torture

the passing days became blurred
and confused in my mind as wo
sat on there and i felt that my brain
was beginning to give at last beneath
the awful strain time still i could
roughly measure though by the
waning of activity in the corridor
outside by the darkening of the crim-
son light that slanted through the
pale-blue walls i think that it was
on the tenth day of our imprison-
ment that i watched that light dark-
ening as always wondering for how
many times i was to see it thus for
how many days years ages we were
to lie in this living death in the
serpent-creatures  museum as i
watched the passing throngs in the
corridor outside were thinning dis-
appearing with the coming of the
dusky night and soon there was almost
complete silence about us only the
low hissing of the two serpent-guards
uear the rooms door as they con-
versed there bieaking the stillness
then suddenly my brooding thoughts
were broken into by sharp surprize as
i glimpsed a big stealthy shape that
showed itself for a moment in the
corridor outside and then dodged
swiftly back

  with a sudden flame of excitement
leaping in me for the first time since
our imprisonment i gazed toward the
door eyes immoving as always a
moment more and the dark erect
shape that i had glimpsed outside
came slowly into view once more
peering around the doors edge at
the two serpent-guards who for the
moment were turned away from it
seeing this the lurking shape came
slowly into the room through the
door from the shadows of the cor-
ridor and as it did so i saw it clearly
and well it was for me that i could

not speak or surely i would have
shouted aloud for it was jhul din

  a great wave of hope flooded
through my brain as i saw the big
spican move stealthily inside a thick
metal bar in his grasp his eyes roving
about the dusky-lit great room then
as they fell upon our own case upon
us sitting motionless i saw him gasp
a moment he surveyed us my eyes
staring stonily straight into his own
as we sat still rigid and unmoving
and then he had turned was moving
silently toward the two unsuspecting
guards closer he crept toward them
while i watched in an agony of
suspense and then as he reached them
raised his great bar above his head the
two creatures warned by some slight
sound whirled suddenly around and
confronted him

  instantly the death-tubes they held
came up but in the moment that they
did so jhul dins bar had smashed
down upon them in a great crushing
blow that laid both lifeless on the blue
force-fioor then the spican sprang
to our case opening its side and lifting
us out seeking with rough restorative
measures to revive us yet we lay as
silent and rigid as ever and i saw
despair creep into his eyes could have
shouted to him in my agony of mind
had not my muscles been as far-sev-
ered from my brains control as ever
then the spican raised from his fruit-
less efforts gazed despairingly about
until his eyes fell upon the niche in
the wall that held the tubes of red
and green fluid with a leap he was
upon them bringing them and the
needle back toward us

  a moment he studied them in
doubt then inserted the needle in the
green fluid and pierced my forearm
with it i eoukl have screamed to him
his mistake had i had power of speech
for the green fluid injected into me
had no effect upon me whatever since
i lay already beneath its force see-
ing this he swiftly made trial of the
red fluid injecting this in the same
manner into my body and then as he


weird tales

gazed anxiously down upon my rigid
figure i felt a sudden warmth flood-
ing through me and for the first time
in all those days became aware of my
body felt muscles and limbs moving
in answer to my wills commands
felt heart and breathing starting after
their long cessation then i was stag-
gering up to my feet the spicans
great arm about me reeling upward
with muscles utterly strange and
cramped after those days of living
death

  jhul din i cried my voice
strange to my own ears after that
time of speechlessness and he gripped
my arm reassuringly

 steady dur nal he said
youre out of that now and we
win clear of this hellish city yet  

  as he spoke he was dropping to the
floor injecting swiftly into the bodies
of the rest the red fluid beginning
with korus kan and as he did so he
explained to me swiftly how he and
his three followers had managed to
elude the ships that had pursued him
by fleeing from them into a near-by
cluster of dead and dying suns and
pretending to have perished by crash-
ing into a great dark star landing his
ship upon its barren bumed-out sur-
face and escaping the scrutiny of the
pursuing ships vvho returned in the
belief that he and his ship had met
annihilation in that hiding-place
upon that black and airless and light-
less star he had remained for days
not daring to venture forth amid the
swarms of serpent-ships that filled the
space- anes about him yet resolved to
return and ascertain our fate when
at last days later he had been able to
venture out back to this vast world
and down upon it through the dusky
night he had boldly landed the ship
where it would excite no suspicion in
the landing-circle from which he had
first escaped in it then leaving his
little crew of thiee in it and stealing
through the shadows of the silent
streets toward the great central build-
ine where he hoped against hope to

find some trace of us he had made
his way through the darkened corri-
dors of the huge structure until he
had stumbled upon the strange muse-
um of the serpent-people where we
were prisoned

  while he swiftly explained this to
me korus kan and our followers were
staggering up beside me as the injec-
tions of red fluid revived them one
by one and i turned toward the door
then uttered a horror-stricken ex-
clamation for in the corridor out-
side a single serpent-ereature faced
us attracted perhaps by the sound of
our voices its glassy eyes full upon
us even in the instant that i saw
it before ever i could leap upon it
it had turned with incredible quick-
ness and was flashing back down the
corridor farther into the great build-
ing uttering as it did so a high hiss-
ing cry and in an instant that cry
was taken up and re-echoed in all the
great structure about us by the
roused serpent-creatures who were
rushing in answer to it

  the alarm i cried out of
the building and to the ship

  with lightning swiftness now jhul
din was injecting in the last of our
followers the restorative red fluid and
then as those last ones stumbled up
into consciousness beside us we raced
toward the door out into the corridor
there abruptly we stopped short
our last wild hopes of escape in that
instant blasted for less than a
thousand feet down the great corridor
from us pouring out into it from
every quarter of the vast buildings
interior in answer to the hissing cries
of alarm there was racing down upon
us a great mass of hundreds upon
hundreds of the writhing serpent-
creatures 

	a dash for freedom

doom stared at us in that instant
as the serpent-creatures rushed
down the great corridor toward us for
well we knew that never could we win
outside the universe



our way down the long street to our
waiting ship with that pursuit behind
us for a flashing moment as we
stood there stunned it seemed that
recapture was inevitable and then as
a sudden thought flared across my
brain i cried out to my companions

  	 get out of the building   i cried
i can hold them here-

  they hesitated and then sprang
down the corridor toward the street
while at the same instant i leapt into
the great museum-hall from which we
had just emerged with a single
bound i had grasped the needle and
tube of restorative red fluid and was
at the great tiansparent cases rip-
ping the sides open frantically and
stabbing the needle with lightning
swiftness into their occupants those
in a dozen or more cases i had swiftly
treated thus before i dropped the tube
and needle and leapt back to the door
into the corridor as i did so i had
seen the first of the strange terrible
shapes i had touched with the needle
beginning to stir to move from their
cases

  as i sprang back out intothe cor-
ridor though the racing masses of
the serpent-ereatures were but a scant
hundred feet behind me my own com-
panions racing out of the building
ahead of me now the serpent-
thin gs loosed no rays upon us desii-
ing i knew to return us to that hell
of living death from which we had
escaped but as i sprang down the
corridor they were so close behind
that another moment i knew would
see my capture and that of my friends
ahead then just as the serpent-
ereatures racing behind me reached
the door of the museum they halted
recoiled for out into the corridor
from that museum-hall had flopped a
great terrible shape the mighty disk
of pale flesh with a single central eye
that my needle had been first to re-
vive 

 instantly it had moved upon the
serpent-ereatures upon whom its
glaring eye fell and before they could

escape had thrown its vast disk of
flesh about a mass of scores of them
bunching its body swiftly together
then with terrific power and crushing
them within it at another mass of
them it leapt ravening with terrific
fury after its prisonment of untold
ages of living death while out of the
museum there came after it the other
shapes i had revived awful insect-
beings that leapt upon the serpent-
ereatures with terrible claws and
fangs heedless of the death-beams
that flashed toward them many-
limbed things of flesh that whirled
forward as fiercely to the attack gro-
tesque terrible monsters of a dozen
different sorts that leapt now upon
the serpent-ereatures who had pris-
oned them for ages with inconceivable
raging power heaping about them
great masses of crushed and mangled
serpent-dead

  only in a glance over my shoulder
did i glimpse that massacre of the
serpent-ereatures behind me for i was
racing on down the corridor and out
of the building into the narrow street
where my friends awaited me with
a word i explained to them what had
happened and instantly we set off
down the street between the great
towering buildings of beaming blue
force that lay silent and dead now in
the dusky darkness only their own
flickering light and that of the vast
dim-red sun that swung in the black
heavens above lighting us forward as
we raced on behind though in the
great building from which we had
fled were rising appalling cries the
hissing utterances of the serpent-
ereatures and the strange and awful
cries of the things with which they
battled

  now about us were rising other
cries as the serpent-ereatures across
all the city began to rouse beneath the
terrific din of the wild fight in the
central building behind us as we
raced on down the narrow street we
saw them emerging from the build-
ings gazing about and then as we


weird tales

were glimpsed fleeing toward the
landing-circle where lay the ships
other cries went up and after us leapt
the serpent-things from all along the
street pouring into that street from
its buildings and from adjacent
streets and racing after us

  but a few hundred yards ahead lay
the landing-circle and as we ran on
we could make out the gleaming great
shapes of the oval ships lying upon
it could discern the shape of our own
awaiting ship at the circles edge its
door open before us toward that
black opening as toward some tre-
mendous magnet we stumbled on with
the last of our strength but close be-
hind came the serpent-creatures in
ever-increasing masses the alarm
spreading now over all the gigantic
city about us and there lay still a dis-
tance that seemed infinite between us
and that open door then when we
were but a scant hundred feet from
it the serpent-creatures hardly more
than that behind us korus kan
slipped stumbled and went down

  we wheeled around reaching down
to help him up but halted even as we
did so for the serpent-creatures be-
hind us were within yards of us now
hissing cries of triumph rising from
them as they writhed toward us
then in the next moment from the
great looming bulk of our ship ahead
there stabbed down and over us a
shaft of blinding crimson light a nar-
row deadly ray that struck the writh-
ing masses of our pursuers and swept
through them in a great slicing curve
sending them into annihilation in daz-
zling bursts of light as it touched
them those farther behind came
racing on nevertheless but before
they could reach us we had stumbled
on and into the ship and with space-
doors clanging and generators sud-
denly droning loud our ship shot up
into the darkness just in time to
escape a dozen pale death-beams that
sprang toward us from the mass of
our pursuers

  up into the darkness above the vast

blue-glowing city we flashed jhul
din and korus kan and i bursting up
into the pilot room and replacing our
follower there whose timely action
had saved us beneath us the whole
city was rising as the alarm spread
lights flashing out here and there
among its buildings serpent-hordes
pouring into the streets while from
the landing-circle from which we had
just risen there shot up after us a
dozen long gleaming oval ships in
close pursuit so swiftly were they
after us that before we had fully
realized their nearness their death-
beams were sweeping and slicing
through the darkness about us i
shouted a swift order korus kan
whirled the controls about and sent
our ship flashing straight back into
the mass of our dozen pursuers and
then wre had leapt through them our
red rays striking right and left as we
did so and two of their great craft
had flared there in the darkness above
the great city in blinding crimson
light and we were racing up into the
darkness again with the ten remaining
ships farther behind but still speed-
ing on our track

  upward we shot with terrific speed
and in a moment the vast turning
world beneath covered with the mass-
es of blue force-struetures had con-
tracted and dwindled to a mere point
beneath us as we fled up and outward
into space as we flashed up from it
though i had glimpsed rising from
it a full five hundred serpent-ships
with a score of the great disk attrac-
tion-ships and as these lifted to fol-
low the ten that leapt close behind us
i saw that the serpent-creatures were
taking no slightest chance of our
escape i turned to korus kan
swiftly as our craft leapt upward
shouting to him above the droning
roar of the generators that filled our
craft now

 head straight out toward the
great vibration-wall-toward the open-
ing in it i cried

  well never get through that open-
outside the universe



rag-between the spaee-forts jhul
din exclaimed theyll have re-
ceived word of our escape and will be
waiting for us

  i	shook my head well have to
run between them and take our
chance i yelled its our one
chance of escape from this universe 

xtowthe giant central world beneath
 was no longer visible as we raced
upward and outward from it at ter-
rific speed and ahead loomed one of
the three giant suns that lay about
that world we were leaping forward
straight toward it and in an instant
it had broadened across the heavens to
a stupendous disk of raging crimson
fire a thunderous titanic sun into
which we seemed inevitably doomed to
plunge but as it flared across the
firmament before us korus kan
swerved the controls and we were
flashing by it past the red stars edge
and on outward through the dying
univei-he traveling at a speed that
was all but suicidal to use inside any
universe thrumming on at all but our
utmost velocity we reeled outward
through the throngs of dead and dying
stars about us while behind us at a
speed that matched our own our ten
pursuers eame relentlessly on with the
five hundred-odd ships that we had
seen rising from the serpent-eity fol-
lowing us hi turn

  out-out-the minutes of that mad
outward flight through the dying uni-
verse are but a confused strange
memory of a wild awful race through
the massed dead and dying stars that
thronged thick about us and between
which we drove with such terrific
swiftness that hardly could we glimpse
them in passing save on our space-
chart on that chart i saw a close-
massed cluster of dark suns full be-
fore us saw the antarian swing the
ship lightninglike sidewise to avoid it
then sharply drive the controls back
again as before us a crimson-flaming
star about which turned countless

  worlds of the serpent-people loomed
before us out-out-flashing crazily
on past crimson sun and thundering
dark-star through the massed suns of
great dead and dying clusters and
past far-swinging planets with the
ten long ships behind clinging re-
morselessly to uk-out-out-until far
ahead there became visible across all
the heavens before us the wavering
pale blue light of the great vibration-
wall that encircled this universe

  out between the last of the dying
universes dark and dying suns we
were racing toward that mighty wall
and as we leapt forward i pointed to-
ward it the space-forts i ex-
claimed make for the opening
between them korus kan-and slack-
en speed a little

  straight toward the two gret
metal structures set in the pale blut-
shining wall we leapt two huge for-
tresses of gleaming metal from whose
narrow openings came brilliant white
light whose mighty death-beam tubes
swung threateningly out toward the
space between them the single vibra-
tion less opening in the vast and im-
penetrable vibration-wall they had
been warned were ready for us we
knew and knew too that not even by
a miracle could our ship run between
those towering forte without coming
under the deadly beams yet still
toward them we leapt at a speed
slackened a little now while after us
like leaping things of prey eame the
ten ships rapidly overhauling us
flashing closer each moment

  we had almost reached the great
opening in the wall now the ten
ships behind almost upon us and as
we flashed through spaee the vhole
scene was like one from some weird
dream-the thronging dark and dying
suns of the great universe behind us
the tremendous all but invisible pae
blue wall of light that enclosed it the
single opening in that wall full before
us guarded on either side by the
mighty metal space-forts the great
ships leaping after us just behind

w t-


weird tales

we were flashing into the narrow
opening-from tlie great space-forts
to right and left the deadly death-
beams were stabbing out toward us in
scores in hundreds-the ships behind
were almost upon us their own
death-beams stabbing toward us-and
then i cried a single word to korus
kan he thrust the controls suddenly
forwaid with a lightninglike move
and just as our ship was flashing
into jtlie narrow opening it dipped
sharply downward instead and plum-
meted down through space while the
ships just behind before they could
dip with us had rushed into the open-
ing and into the hell of death-beams
that crossed and recrossed in it from
the space-forts on each side

  the next instant while we curved
swiftly upward again we saw the ten
ships that had rushed into that open-
ing whirling blindly about as the
death-beams from their own space-
forts seared through them and wiped
out all life inside them those in the
great space-forts realizing those ten
to be their own ships had turned off
the beams in the next moment but
were an instant too late since in the
narrow opening the ten ships were
whirling crazily to that side and this
without guiding intelligence inside
them smashing into each other and
into the space-forts on each side as
they rushed insanely in all directions
and even as that wild confusion in-
side the opening was at its height our
own ship had curved up and was
flashing at full speed into the open-
ing between the space-forts

  for an instant in that wild chaos
of whirling ships those in the space-
forts did not glimpse our own flying
ship and in that instant we were half
through the great opening between
them then they had seen us had
loosed their beams upon us in scores
and in the next instant all about us
seemed a single tremendous melee of
aimlessly whirling ships and gigantic
space-forts and pale death-beams that
sliced and swept about its thick
about us flashed those ghostly fingers
of death and full before us two of the
whirling ships collided and smashed
with terrific force then korus kan
had dodged them by a swift shifting
of the controls our generators roared
suddenly louder as he turned on our
utmost speed and the crazy chaos of
ships and beams and forts about us
had suddenly vanished replaced by
darkness and silence xmutterable

  we were through were racing out
into the void again with the great
vibration-wall and the dying universe
it enclosed and the pursuing serpent-
ships inside it dropping farther be-
hind each moment in the blackness
that encircled us the dying universe
was a far-flung dwindling glow be-
hind us and our own a far patch of
misty light to the left but there shone
in the darknes far ahead a misty disk
of radiant light and it was toward
this that our ship was heading for
we were flashing out again upon our
interrupted mission were flying out
through the awful gulf of outer space
once more toward the andromeda
universe

the thrilling events that occurred in the andromeda universe
will be narrated in next month s chapters

he leaped through the fire as the voices of the
people rose to a screech

you are right seiior i compre-
hend them perfectly i have
led no fewer than three on the
long journey into the jungles they
are very strange each male-i know
nothing of the women - has in his
heart one great passion an idol that
he bows down to and worships and
slaves for and makes sacrifices to
even to the sacrificing of his family
or his life or his own happiness

  i am told that every day in north
america-in your country sir-the
natives rush about hither and thither
in the wildest confusion each bent
upon serving that special passion
which is in his heart so that they col-
lide vehicles smash the weak are
trampled upon is that true senorf
but pardon it is perhaps not the dis-
creet inquiry

  have you a match  thanks yes

i will accept a cigarette since you
offer it but it was only that i de-
sired a match to whittle down for a
toothpick

  those three yankees-la-la each
with the hard thing in his heart john
axe he was for gold he must have
it but what he brought from the
jungles sir was an arrow wound and
a fever

  and the man thripp hunter of
bugs yes given to it day and night
to the exclusion of mercy for those
who served him

  and the man that named himself
professor erie lincoln dobro what
do you think senor was his idol  the
strangest of all the seeking of the
ultimate sanctuary the law of hap-
piness the point of eternal serenity
yes ha-ha-ha

  the moment the news reached the

                                  


weird tales

plaza that a stranger from north
america was in town i hurried to his
hotel with a collection of curios that
i had gathered on the trip with the
bug-hunter to a room like this
senor where you and i sit beside this
table but he did not invite me to sit
comfortably he was a tall lean man
with hard and eutting eyes very im-
patient

  what have you he sang out the
instant i pushed the door open i
do not wish to buy fruit or curios or
statues of the saints finish quickly
and depart

  i am not alert to take offense sir i
hastily dumped the contents of my
wicker on his table-a savage priests
feather head-dress a withered hand a
condors talon a dart-blower a neck-
lace or two of teeth a little dried hu-
man head of the jivaros that had
come my way in trade such odds and
ends

  a stale wild jungle fragrance-a
stench sir that had been accumulat-
ing since the case was last open
puffed up into our faces

  smell it dobro squeaked plung-
ing his long beak into the thick of it
you have brought the jungle to me
in a bag  

  a green fire lit his sharp cold eyes

  he clawed among my offerings
brushing them aside contemptuously
muttering that they would not inter-
est a third-rate museum until he hit
upon the most insignificant object of
all-a crude little human figure on a
pedestal molded in clay and roughly
burnt he seized it up in both hands
and gaped at it

  that figure sir was a curious thing
the pedestal was shaped like a basin
it represented a mud-puddle and
knee-deep in the puddle stood the
little figure it was as if a human
being had risen up out of that puddle
into the world mud ran down the
body dripped from the ends of the
hands black mud that stuck on like
clabber milk mud was on the head
and mud covered the face it was an

ugly thing a revolting thing sir but
a work of art - savage degrading
jungle art

  where did this come from that
dobro demanded hoarsely-he spoke
and understood spanish with the same
fluency that i peiceive is yours sir
what sort of people made this ho
flung speak you stupid chunk
i am not a slave to be bawled at-
la-la my deliberate answer was to
pluck that object from his fingers and
set it up on my own palm and hold
it out tantalizing him

  that man stared sir and paled he
leaned toward it and at the same time
he pulled away from it he was tike a
man tempted by perdition

  god he cried out what an
obscenity

  obscenity i protested think-
ing he was preparing to offer me a
low price senor i said with dig-
nity its value lies in that it is a
consummate depiction of stupidity
he did not heed me his eyes
were fastened upon that thing and
they were so hot with a green cold
fire that i stared at it too trying to
see what he saw wondering if its
value might be more than i had
suspected

  i regarded it a long time with the
thoughts of a man of mature expe-
riences but i could make out noth-
ing of consequence it did not
express anything at all except a
human being as low as a river animat
rising up out of its bed of mud

  that was what i saw then and it
was all that i was ever able to per-
ceive afterward though that dobro
saw other things-la-la amazing
astounding incredible things sir

    god   said dobro again looking
at the figure filling my palms so neat-
ly god it is the essence of stupid-
ity it is a symbol of mankind rising
from mindlessness it is emerging
from the door that i have long sought
to go back through   

  he snatched it from me and hugged
the idol-chaser



it to his breast like a fierce and
hungry beast

  where did you get this he
thundered suddenly wheie did it
come from speak up man dont
stand there like a gaping yokel  

  to calm him i told him how an
indio of the jungles had given it to the
bug-hunter who threw it away into
the wet mold of the deep forest and
how i recognizing its value and inter-
est had retrieved it and carried it all
that long journey back across the
mountains to civilization which was
the positive truth sir

  but who made it dobro in-
sisted   who was the artist   

  one of the tribe i answered

  ah you know that his words
gouged like a stiff finger you know
that

  yes i said

  you can furnish proof

  yes

   	 what proof   he spat at me

  i saw one of the tribe rise from
the mud like that i told him

  his steely eyes that had no com-
passion whatever penetrated me sir
for a full minute

   	 if you are lying   he said at last
like the hiss of a viper i will kill
you 

  he jerked his chair over against the
door and sat down in it so that i
could not have escaped even had i
been alarmed and disposed to run
away from there and get out into the
blessed sunlight of the plaza

  now my man he said you and
i are going to make a contract right
here and now for you to guide me
across the mountains and into the
selfsame wilderness where you got that
image and saw that emergence from
the mud  

  i protested that my health had been
ruined by the other two journeys that
i was a sick man that my family was
poor and needed my constant pres-
ence which was and is the absolute
truth sir but he was very liberal in
his offers an admirable trait of the

yankees  so we arranged for me
to conduct him

  and you would go to study the
trees senor is it the lumber that
you are interested in or rubber
but you need not answer i am not
of the inquisitive soit it is none of
my affair

whew  that was a terrific jour-
ney with dobro i mop my fore-
head thus when i think of it only
a great deal of money could persuade
me again after many hardships in
which i bore the burdens of all we at
last arrived in the steaming valleys
of those headwater tributaries of the
amazon

  from the very first this professor
eric lincoln dobro-he said the eric
stood for scandinavian blood in his
veins the lincoln for anglo-saxon
and the dobro for southern euro-
pean i do not know that was too
much for me but i do swear he had
the look of a long-faced spaniard as
i started to say from the first this
man kept prattling at my ear about
the tribe of the mud-did they do
this and did they do that which
was but natural considering that i
was the only educated man with him
the others were but indios who
deserted us every day or two so
that we were continually employing
new ones

  when we at last began to find the
wild and flitting tribes in those sweat-
ing jungles this dobros curiosity
knew no appeasing he spoke with
many of the chiefs and wizaids-
through me of course for i make
fluent use of many dialects-beseech-
ing them always for the secrets of
their mystic tribal rites and inquir-
ing constantly where the tribe of the
mud was to be found

  those indians were very timorous
and would run away but twice by
gifts we persuaded a handful or two
to put  their ritualistic ceremonies
once we arrived at a village where a
dance was beginning dobro danced

weird tales

with them yes he stripped to a
breeeh-rag hung about his neck the
hot entrails of a fowl that he killed
with his own hands as the savages
were doing and danced till he fell
exhausted

  i was revolted sir that is the ab-
solute truth i expostulated with him
as one gentleman to another he
pushed me away with his bloody
hands and hew into a rage

  leave off  he shouted with a mad
look in his eyes stop your inter-
fering i will not be hindered i i
who search for the law of happiness
the ultimate sanctuary the place of
eternal serenity i i who have es-
chewed the common means-women
and war the ordinary sciences com-
merce and utopias and religion bah
i explore the unexplored stand aside
i will not be blocked by the brother
of an ox

  brother of an ox-to me senor
but i did not take offense he did not
truly mean me he did not look at
me when he said it his darting eyes
were upon his own thoughts he was
never a man to hold conversation
with he could not hold to a subject
he could not hear other mens talk
he would break into the middle of
your conversation or stop in the
middle of his own and forget to go on
but he was forever prattling his
phrases to the air flighty as the wind

  the law of happiness-was not
 hat amusing sir i could have told
him what it was a bit of money an
industrious wife a moderate number
of children-eight or ten-a recent
shriving a comfortable bench in the
plaza-and a few other things-a
few-other things-la-la it is best
perhaps not to pursue that sir
money wife children priests ben-
ediction bench in the sun and stop

  la-la-the ultimate sanctuary   

  and what if you find it i
asked him once

  his eyes burned green and fierce
and unseeing up through the tree-
tops

  i shall be the greatest seieatist
in the world he cried out like aa
orator i shall have served hu-
manity  

  if you dont find it i persisted
just to hear what he would say for i
am not inquisitive

  his countenance fell he looked
at the ground a long time before he
spoke

  if i dont find it-the integrity
of science must be carried on he
was very meek if i dont-i shall
nevertheless give to the world what
i do find that is the integrity of
science

  my heart went out to him sir in
that moment of meekness though i
did not understand him clearly not
that i am not highly intelligent but
he talked in riddles yet his meek-
ness soon vanished and he kept on
with his mercilessness worshiping
that passion that hard idol that was
in his heart

  he knew no rest he would lie on
his belly close beside the light of a
smudge fire by night and write end-
less reams of fine script and mutter
by day he drove himself and me
and those indios through the twi-
light paths of those ever-growing
ever-perishing jungles of the little
handfuls of flitting people that we
found he made continual inquiry for
the tribe of the mud and the more
he saw of low and stupid and revolt-
ing humanity the more obsessed he
became

 he was like men who become
slaves of the opium who ever need
more and more to satisfy their flesh
until their appetite outstrips their
capacity and can no longer be satis-
fied that is the way of flesh sir
it can not be satisfied only reason
can be satisfied

  i did not think this out so phil-
osophically in the jungle no we
were too busy fighting the mosquito
the jaguar and the vampire bat that
sucks the blood i arrived at these
weighty conclusions here iti the ease
the dl-chaser



of the plaza weeks afterward when i
brought all my intelligence to bear-
and talked somewhat with scientific
friends and the priest

 we went hither and thither in
search of those people of the mud
one river was the replica of another
and at last he began childishly to
chide me with an inability to find the
tribe we had set out to see he was a
madman sir

  however in due time by gods-
you need not start senor i often
cross myself when i mention his
name my elbow striking the edge of
the table and the tiny cigarette end
was merely an accident eh-another
cigarette i do not object since you
offer it

  as  was saying in due time by
rods gift to me of a surpassing skill
in junglecraft  was able to pfenetrate
the mazes of that sweating wilderness
and arrive in triumph at the tribe of
the ultimate secret

tyte came upon them without wam-
vv ing jn a dusky glade two or
three stood in a pool of mud laving
their naked bodies with slow motions
a dozen a score of others wallowed
in the black mess or lay along the rim
of the basin in sluggish lassitude

  how shall i make you see that pic-
ture senor they did not flee they
were not startled they watched us
with iazy eyes stupid eyes they
were like crocodiles they were -
dobro used a phrase-ah like pre-
historic amphibians that had not ac-
quired sufficient life to crawl out from
under the clumsy feet of the mam-
moths  

  we watched them throughout the
afternoon the finding of them was
like a sedative to dobro-in one way
his madness vanished he became
quiet and studious bat inside him
it was plain to see a great tenseness
and expectation were at work he
approached them by slow degrees
finally he was close enough to squat
and touch one it squeaked like a

load when you punch it with your
finger and wriggled barely out of
reach and jay still with eyes blinking
sluggishly

  as the afternoon wore on i knew
that dobro was up to something sir
he was too subdued outwardly too
excited within toward night he
placed all his written notes in the rub-
ber bag and sealed it and put the bag
into the leather case and stuffed it
into my knapsack then he turned
on me

  you he said rub the sleep
out of your eyes and listen to me
d you hear  see these written pages
of mine you are to take them in the

packet just as they are to the amer-
ican consul if something happens to
me-if i do not come back do you
understand   

  	 if you do not come back  i re-
peated in astonishment you are
quite somewhere now in this trackless
jungle whither else can you go  

  he tossed his head angrily he sat
down on the ground before me in ex-
aggerated patience

   admirable comrade he said
seething inside i perceive that i
must explain the unexplainable to a
brother of the ox lest you spill the
beans this night try try i prithee
try once to comprehend

  you see sir he was of a madness
we had no beans but not too mad to
marshal his thoughts and presently
proceed

    the law of happiness   he began
in a restrained tone the ultimate
sanctuary is not to be found in any-
thing that humanity knows all that
humanity conceives of is but broken
dishes from which to eat i scorn its
every phase the law and the sanc-
tuary may lie in the next world if
such a world there be but i can not
go forward into it and return with a
message the law and the sanctuary
may lie back in the world from which
mankind emerged it may lie just
back of that point where mind first


weird tales

flickered in flesh i intend-i intend
to go back-to see 

  ilis voice broke sir and rose shril-
ly he bit his lip and strove to hold
his enforced calmness

  these people he continued are
the low ebb of humanity it is plain
to see they are in the midst of some
remarkable ritual or undertaking
they appear to be withdrawing their
minds from the flesh-appear now to
be almost mindless

  again his voice flew up and this
time he went on without bringing it
under submission flinging words into
my face

  i mean to join them i mean to
do what they do i mean to think
what they think i mean to go with
them to the very point of flesh-with-
out-mind mayhap for a moment on
beyond that port into the other world
-and find the ultimate sanctuary in

-some static condition-

  he could keep calm no longer sir
he sprang up he paced back and
forth his hands opened and clenched
he ilung a command at me

  you whatever happens tonight
do you not interfere this is the op-
portunity i have long sought these
people are the path and the door and
the key keep you off your meddling
hands

  then again in a moment

  do you comprehend brother of
the ox do you comprehend all that i
have said

oh certainly i assured him
yes indeed and i shall retain
every word in my incomparable mem-
ory and repeat them to civilization
do precisely that he said

  in these last moments the swift
tropic night had fallen like a weight
we were in a sea of darkness through
which we might not swim up to any
surface as if it were a signal dobro
stripped off his ragged garments
what few were left to us i could see
his white body vaguely in the black-
ness suddenly he flung his arm out
and whispered

  what is that behind you

  i jerked around nothing was
there i turned back dobro was
gone he had used that ancient ruse
to vanish from my sight

  i searched twice around that pool
of mud for him being careful not to
step on those things i shouted thrice
into the jungle but the walls of the
glade only threw my voice back at me
like shattered stones

  i was distraught sir i sat down
with my back to a tree i was very
weary also i had not slept since day-
break i must have inadvertently
dozed off for the next thing that i
knew dobro was shaking me and
gouging me painfully with the tines
of out eating-fork and hissing in my
ear

 wake up pig thus he ad-
dressed me in his mad fashion make
an outer and i will impale your
tongue listen with care the indios
are departing assemble our packs
and follow but have a care that you
do not alarm them  

  i leaped alertly to my feet the
moon had risen high up it lighted
the glade that dobro sir was like
a black ghost mud from head to foot
he gave me a start i tell you with
a final gouge dobro disappeared

  i proceeded to put our belongings
into the bags including his discarded
garments in the midst of this there
came a sudden and inexplicable sound
from the jungle it was like nothing
that i had ever heard in all my wide
experience it was a hollow sound
or many sounds without definite lo-
cation for one mad moment sir i
thought it came from the man in the
moon

  i am a courageous man sir there
is none braver but in that moment
i fell upon my knees beseeching god
and the blessed virgin and several of
the saints to preserve me whole for
my familys sake while i was thus
engaged in holy fervor that dobro ap-
proached me from the rear and set
the idol-chaser



his muddy foot midway of my shoul-
ders and tumbled me over on my face

  knock off with that howling su-
perstition he ordered briskly and
bring those packs

  it is not good luck to kick over a
man at prayer it is sacrilegious
but i hold no animosity against senor
dobro seeing what happened to him

by the time i was up and had the
packs on my back those savages
and dobro himself had passed through
a black spot in the jungle wall i fol-
lowed and found myself in the usual
narrow wilderness path hard-packed
and moist with roots and vines to trip
the unwary feet and leaves to
scratch ones ears once my hand
closed upon a serpent and it licked
my cheek with its forked tongue a
bad sign another time dobro eame
looking for me back along the trail
groping with a stick like a blind man
he punched me in the face with it
sir cutting my lip behold the slight
puckering scar that remains to this
day ordinarily i conceal it with a
cigarette

  thanks i will the entire packet
what beneficence the sort that i
myself admiie and practise

  the inexplicable sound that i had
heard went on far ahead of the pro-
cession as we advanced it became
drowned in the drone of a waterfall
that we had heard throughout the day
and that now became louder and
louder as i progressed

  after quite a while i saw a fire
gleaming through the interstices of
the jungle i judged the indios had
arrived at their destination and pro-
ceeded with caution at the last i
crawled on my hands and knees thus
it was that i came to another glade
and was able to see lying flat on my
stomach behind a spray of leaves the
whole scene before me

  and what a scene sir la-la the
huge branches of vast trees formed a
canopy through which no gleam of the
stars was visible in the middle of

the open space was a great basin of
thin mud beside the basin a huge
fire burned and ringing the glade
around was a line of savages sitting
on the ground and hugging their knees
-old men and women and children and
babes in arms the glade was at the
very brink of the cataract that had
been roaring in my ears a mist rose
from it lighted weirdly by that fire
and rising into the canopy of leaves
and black branches like steam from a
witchs cauldron

  at one point in the ring weie
grouped the mud-covered savages that
we had first seen i perceived now
that they were the strong and hardy
ones of the tribe men and women
the great crackling fire was between
them and the pool of glistening mud
they sat motionless stupid i made
out dobro among them in the rear
rank he was distinguishable by his
superior height and size he sat like
the others hugging his knees-though
i could see his mud-caked head lift now
and then and turn this way and that
no doubt those green and cutting
eyes of his were taking in the sights

  presently i became conscious of a
new sound over the roar of the water-
fall-and that inexplicable sound that
had alarmed me was explained it
was made by men grunting and chant-
ing into the open ends of some sort
of bamboo contrivances - a hollow
booming sound as vague and strange
sir as anything that ever i heard

  as this grew in rising volume the
old men began to beat on tom-toms
at first this was barely audible but
gradually it grew louder and louder
then i noticed that the lips of all the
people save the mud-covered ones
were moving slowly gradually their
volume rose and chimed in with the
booming and the tom-tom beating-a
chanting wailing thumping booming
diapason ever swelling louder and
higher and wilder

  sir to me this savage music was the
very voice of the jungle the voice of
mystery the voice of savagery it


weird tales

stirred in me an emotion that i could
not express in words could not express
even in my own thoughts fear lonely
longing ecstasy-a sad ecstacy from
the throbbing sobbing pulse of a con-
fused and wondering world

  the pulsing and sobbing and wail-
ing rose to their height my flesh
crept my heart seemed about to
break then from out of that knot
of mud-caked savages a man rose up
his eyes were strangely upon that
fire and the glistening smooth sur-
face of the mud beyond he sprang
forward he leaped through the fire
as the voices of the people rose in a
screech he plunged feet first into the
black pool he sank from sight he
did not come up he did not appear
again

  while i drew my panting breaths
sir another mud-caked figure arose
he stared at the fire fanatically he
ran and leaped through the flames
and shot straight down into the mud
the surface had not settled when
another arose and followed and
others one after another eager
fanatical and all the while the tom-
toms beat the bamboos boomed and
the people wailed

  i am always alert sir but i had
forgotten that i was in charge of that
madman dobro when i remem-
bered only a handful of the mud-
caked savages were left i made
haste i tell you to save him i
crawled through the vines and foliage
of the jungle to seize him from behind
and drag him to safety but that
jungle was dense and held me like
hands when at last by my superior
strength and determination i came
up behind the point where he sat and
was ready to reach out all the others
were gone and dobro was just rising
to his feet in a step he was beyond
my grasp

  i think sir those savages in the pool
where we first came upon them had not
told the other tribespeople about do-
bro s and my presence perhaps they
did not speak in the course of their

ritual when that ring of people saw
the huge height of dobro and per-
ceived that a stranger was among
them their music and their wailing
stumbled and then rose again

  dobro hesitated i suspect he was
wondering what was beneath that
glistening surface i felt pity for
that lone slightly stooped figure
standing there a supreme fool but
he was a man of courage sir only 
a second did he pause then he too
sprang forward leaped through the
fire and plunged out of sight in the
black pool

  the music and the wailing stopped
off short the night seemed so still
that it was a moment before i caught
again the roar of the cataract the
musicians gathered up their tom-toms
and hooting instruments stuck them
under their arms and started away
for all the world like musicians at the
close of a conceit in the city plaza
the women took their children and
the whole tribe filed away down a
path along the brink of the waterfall
disappearing downward into the black
jungle

the instant the glade was empty i
rushed from my hiding-place to
the pool its surface was calm i
looked about its farther side mingled
with the great snaky roots of one of
those huge trees it was dark among
those roots i got a torch from the
fire and held it down in those muddy
claws of that tree

  i found a trench sir that had been
dug from the brink of the pool among
the roots to the waterfall-nothing
less than a slideway that dropped
steeply down into the cataract i ap-
plied my alert mind to the problem

i realized that those people diving
feet first into the pool could easily
have thrust their bodies forward be-
neath the surface and come up within
two or three seconds in the darkness
among the roots from there with a
twist of their bodies they could have
slid over the brink and shot down the
the idol-chaser



slideway into the fuming cataract
for a fact the brim of the pool showed
slick where naked bodies had slid
over convinced of this and hopeful
again for dobro i got the knapsacks
and started down the path where i
had seen the tribe go

  i made my way a quarter of a mile
downstream and retraced my steps
part-way back i shouted but my
voice was absorbed in the roar of the
waterfall i heard no one i saw
nothing but the stars twinkling above
the stream where the tree-tops did not
come together i gave up for the
night it was useless to search in that
darkness lest i be robbed of the
knapsacks i used them for a pillow i
believe it is good policy for men on
an expedition to get what sleep they
can

  when i awakened it was day
those natives sir who had gone
through the mud were wading along
in the shallow rapids of the stream
their bodies were wet and gleaming
they were washed clean they had
the look of a man who has just been
shrived by the priest

  and then i saw that dobro he was
sitting on a flat rock in the rapids
without clothing hugging his knees
a patch of morning sunlight shining
through the tree-tops upon him you
can imagine my relief at finding him
still among us

  but that which he was doing sir
was in a sense remarkable he was
looking at those washed natives with
an expression-la-la

  once here in the city a stranger
from a ship came among us selling for
a coin or two a little box that said
upon it in print raise the lid and
see the biggest fool in the world we
bought them with alacrity and waste
of good money when we opened the
lids we beheld our own faces in a mir-
ror you can imagine our feelings

  sir this dobro had just such an
expression on his face as he looked at
those shrived natives like a man
who had been fooled

  the indios came up the bank of the
river the men taking one path and
the women another and disappeared
into the jungle when they were gone
that dobros expression altered it
changed to a kind of solemn amaze-
ment and utter incredulity his lips
began to move and to hear what he
was saying i arose and moved quietly
nearer and what words sir

  well ill be damned i even i
did it even i

  he was not profane sir he was
incredulous he stared blankly into
space and with each word he nodded
his head in short jerks

  even i did it well ill be
damned  

  i stepped nearer and addressed
him

  no doubt you are right sir i
said but why be so astonished
about it he looked up at me

  did you wake up at last he
asked

  did you find your ultimate sanc-
tuary i retorted

  yes he said and regarded me
as if defying me to contradict him

  he solemnly raised his bare arm
and pointed up the purling river to
where the cataract boiled and the
mist arose

  yes he repeated when those
waters were whirling me and holding
me down when they were smothering
me and making my struggle futile
when there was nowhere else to turn
in my extremity i turned to god like
any common yokel and prayed to
him to deliver me

  he spat vehemently he spat so
vehemently sir that his spittle
crackled on the surface of the water

  get the knapsacks he ordered
like a sergeant make haste we
go

 go i cried what next
where now

  back to civilization he an-
swered   back to tell the world what
 did what i did

  sir he had but exchanged one idol


weird tales

for another his idol had been to
find the ultimate sanctuary now it
was to tell the world what he had
done la-la and the last was worse
than the first for he gave me no rest
showed no mercy in that long race
back over the mountains

  so you see sir i comprehend the
north americans i will make a
valuable guide for you into the

jungles if we can make satisfactory
financial arrangements    yes i
comprehend them thoroughly ex-
cept for one little thing sir a mere
trifle why did that dobro take that
little idol-figure of roughly burnt
clay for which he had paid me four
dollars and twist it in his strong
hands and break it up and throw the
pieces into the river

ballad of winds

      by paul francis sutton

    over the roof-tops and through the streets
    dances and shouts the black north wind

    rushes and whirls advances retreats

    then chuckles in glee at the bloody rind
    of a dying moon fleshless and blind

    while strangling fast in the grip of the night
    scintillant stars struggle to find
    a logical cause for the winds delight

    but the wind whoops on oer the rotting slime
    of bones on an alleys garbage heap

    and the wind wails on down the caves of time
    disturbing the dust o er the shades asleep

    till out from their ebon bodies creep
    whispering things by the sane forgot

    phantom tilings o the pits sunk deep
    in the charnel mush of the worlds black rot

    ho the night screams in the bellowing wind

    while down the dark sweep of a star-paven trail
    dance crystalline shadows of breezes designed
    and formed by the mad demon god of the gale

    swept high oer the roof-tops gibber and wail
    like imbecile children like maniacs spawn

    dark memories laughing till skies turning pale
    command all the phantoms to death in the dawn

                lenvoi

    ho prince you laugh at my songs of the night
    indulgent you smile and perchance praise their tune
    then turn to sweet singers who drool of delight

    for prince you re afraid of the winds and the moon

by pbemson

the head covered by the death-cap it
swung in the window against the sunset

had been telling father denys
hanbury about a very extraor-
dinary seance which i had at-
tended a few days before the me-
dium in trance had said a whole
series of things which were unknown
to anybody but myself and a friend
of mine who had lately died and who
so she said was present or was speak-
ing to me through her naturally
from the strictly scientific point of
view in which alone we ought to ap-
proach such phenomena such in-
formation was not really evidence
that the spirit of my friend was in
touch with her for all this was al-
ready known to me and might by
some proeess of telepathy have been
communicated to her from my brain
and not through the agency of my
friend she spoke too not in her

own ordinary voice but in a voice
which certainly was very like his
then again however his voice was
known to me it was in my memory
even as were the things she had been
saying all this therefore as i was
remarking to father denys must be
ruled out as positive evidence that
communications had been coming
from the other side of death

  a telepathic explanation was pos-
sible i said and we have to ac-
cept any known explanation which
covers the facts before we conclude
that the dead have come back into
touch with the material world

  the room was quite warm but i

saw that he shivered slightly and

hitching his chair a little nearer the

fire he spread out his hands to the

blaze such hands they were  beau-

                                  


weird tales

tiful and expressive of him and so
like the praying hands of albert
diirer the blaze shone through them
as through rose-red alabaster

  he shook his head its a ter-
ribly dangerous thing to attempt to
get into communication with the
dead   he said   if you seem to get
into touch with them you run the risk
of establishing connection not with
them but with awful and perilous in-
telligences study telepathy by all
means for that is one of the marvels
of the mind which we are meant to
investigate like any other of the won-
derful secrets of nature but i in-
terrupt you you said something else
occurred tell me about it  

  now i knew father denys creed
about such things and deplored it
he holds as his church commands
him that intercourse with the spirits
of the dead is impossible and that
when it appears to occur as it un-
doubtedly does the enquirer is really
in touch with some species of dra-
matic demon who is impersonating
the spirit of the dead such a theory
has always seemed to me as monstrous
as it is without foundation and there
is nothing i can discover in the
recognized sources of christian doc-
trine which justifies such a view

  yes now comes the queer part
i said for still speaking in the
voice of my friend the medium told
me something which instantly i be-
lieved to be untrue it could not
therefore have been drawn telepath-
ically from me after that the
seance came to an end and in order
to convince myself that this could not
have come from him i looked up the
diary of my friend which had been
left me at his death and which had
just been sent me by his executors
and was still unpacked there i
found an entry which proved that
what the medium had said was abso-
lutely correct a certain thing-i
neednt go into it-had occurred pre-
cisely as she had stated though i
should have been willing to swear to

the contrary that can not have come
into her mind from mine and there
is no source that i can see from which
she could have obtained it except
from my friend what do you say
to that

  he shook his head

  i dont alter my position at all
he said that information given it
did not come from your mind which
certainly seems to be impossible
came from some discamate agency
but it didnt come from the spirit of
your friend it came from some evil
and awful intelligence 

  but isnt that pure assump-
tion i asked it is surely much
simpler to say that the dead can un-
der certain conditions communicate
with us why drag in the devil

  he glanced at the clock

    its not very late   he said   un-
less you want to go to bed give me
your attention for half an hour and
i will try to show you

  the rest of my story is what father
denys told me and what happened
immediately afterward

  though you are not a catholic  
-i he said i think you would
agree with me about an institution
which plays a very large part in our
ministry namely confession as re-
gards the sacredness and the in-
violability of it a soul laden with
sin comes to his confessor knowing
that he is speaking to one who has the
power to pronounce or withhold for-
giveness but who will never for any
conceivable reason repeat or hint at
what has been told him if there was
the slightest chance of the penitents
confession being made known to any-
one unless he himself for purposes
of expiation or of righting some
wrong chooses to repeat it no one
would ever come to confession at all
the church would lose the greatest
hold it possesses over the souls of
men and the souls of men would lose
that inestimable comfort of knowing
not hoping merely but knowing
the hanging op alfred wadham



that their sins were forgiven them of
course the priest may withhold abso-
lution if he is not convinced that he
is dealing with a true penitent and
before he gives it he will insist that
the penitent makes such reparation
as is in his power for the wrong he
has done if he has profited by his
dishonesty he must make good what-
ever crime he has committed he must
give warrant that his penitence is
sincere but i think you would agree
that in any case the priest can not
whatever the result of his silence may
be repeat what has been told him
by doing so he might right or avert
some hideous wrong but it is impos-
sible for him to do so what he has
heard he has heard under the seal of
confession concerning the sacredness
of which no argument is conceivable 
it is possible to imagine awful
consequences resulting from it i
said but i agree

  before now awful consequences
have come of it he said but they
dont touch the principle and now
i am going to tell you of a certain
confession that was once made to me 
but how can you i said
thats impossible surely

  for a certain reason which we
shall come to later he said you
will see that secrecy is no longer in-
cumbent on me but the point of my
story is not that it is to warn you
about attempting to establish com-
munication with the dead signs and
tokens voices and apparitions appear
to come through to us from them
but who sends them you will see
what i mean

   i settled myself down to listen

vou will probably not remember
i with any distinctness if at all
a murder committed a year ago when
a man called gerald selfe met his
death there was no enticing mys-
tery about it no romantic accessories
and it aroused no public interest
selfe was a man of loose life but he
held a respectable position and it

would have been disastrous for him if
his private irregularities had come to
light for some time before his death
he had been receiving blackmailing
letters regarding his relations with a
certain married woman and very
properly he had put the matter into
the hands of the police they had
been pursuing certain clues and on
the afternoon before selfes death one
of the officers of the criminal investi-
gation department had written to him
that everything pointed to his man-
servant who certainly knew of his in-
trigue being the culprit this was a
young man named alfred wadham
he had only lately entered selfes
service and his past history wtas of
the most unsavory sort they had
baited a trap for him of which de-
tails were given and suggested that
selfe should display it which within
an hour or two he successfully did
this information and these instruc-
tions were conveyed in a letter which
after selfes death was found in a
drawer of his writing-table of which
the lock had been tampered with
only wadham and his master slept
in his flat and a woman came in every
morning to cook breakfast and do the
house-work and selfe lunched and
dined at his club or in the restaurant
on the ground-floor of this house of
flats and here he dined that night
when the woman came in next morn-
ing she found the outer door of the
flat open and selfe lying dead on the
floor of his sitting-room with his
throat cut wadham had disap-
peared but in the slop-pail of his bed-
room was water which was stained
with human blood he was caught
two days afterward and at his trial
elected to give evidence his story
was that he suspected he had fallen
into a trap and that while mr selfe
was at dinner he searched his draw-
ers and found the letter sent by the
police which proved that this was the
case he therefore decided to bolt
and he left the flat that evening
before his master came back to it

weird tales

after dinner being in the witness-
box he was of course subjected to a
searching cross-examination and con-
tradicted himself in several particu-
lars then there was that incrim-
inating evidence in his room and the
motive for the crime was clear enough
after a very long deliberation the
jury found him guilty and he was
sentenced to death his appeal which
followed was dismissed

 wadham was a catholic and
since it is my office to minister to
catholic prisoners at the jail where
he was lying under sentence of death
i had many talks with him and en-
treated him for the sake of his immor-
tal soul to confess his guilt but
though he was even eager to confess
other misdeeds of his some of which
it was ugly work to speak of he main-
tained his innocence on this charge
of murder nothing shook him and
though as far as i could judge he was
sincerely penitent for other misdeeds
ie swore to me that the story lie told
in court was in spite of that contra-
diction in which he had involved him-
self essentially true and that if he
was hanged he died unjustly up till
the last afternoon of his life when i
sat with him for two hours praying
and pleading with him he stuck to
hiiat why he should do that unless
indeed he was innocent when he was
eager to search his heart for the con-
cession of other gross wickednesses was
icurious the more i pondered it the
tnore inexplicable i found it and
during that afternoon doubt as to his
guilt began to grow in me a terrible
thought it was for he had lived in
sin and error and tomorrow his life
was to be broken like a snapped stick
i was to be at the prison again before
six hi the morning and i still had to
determine whether i should give him
the sacrament if he went to his
death guilty of murder but refusing
to confess i had no right to give it
him but if he was innocent my with-
holding of it was as terrible as any
miscarriage of justice then on my

way out i had a word with one of the
warders which brought my doubt
closer to me

   what do you make of wadham
i asked

  he drew aside to let a man pass
who nodded to him somehow i knew
that he was the hangman

   i dont like to think of it sir he
said i know he was found guilty
and that his appeal failed but if you
ask me whether i believe him to be
a murderer why no i dont

 t spent the evening alone about

  a ten oclock as i was on the point
of going to bed i was told that a man
called horace kennion was below
and wanted to see me he was a
catholic and though i had been
friends with him at one time certain
things had come to my knowledge
which made it impossible for me to
have anything more to do with him
and i had told him so he was
wicked-oh dont misunderstand me
we all do wicked things constantly
the life of us all is a tissue of mis-
deeds but he alone of all men i had
ever met seemed to me to love wicked-
ness for its own sake i said i could
not see him but the message came
back that his need was urgent and
up he came he wanted he told me
to make his confession not tomorrow
but now and his confessor was away
i could not as a priest resist that
appeal and his confession was that
he had killed gerald selfe

    for a moment i thought this was
some impious joke but he swore he
was speaking the truth and still
under the seal of confession gave me a
detailed account he had dined with
selfe that night and had gone up
afterward to his flat for a game of
piquet selfe told him with a grin
that he was going to lay his servant
by the heels tomorrow for blackmail
a smart spry young man today he
said perhaps a bit off color tomor-
row at this time he rang the bell
for him o put out the card-table t
the hanging of alfred wadham



then saw it was ready and he forgot
that his summons remained unan-
swered they played high points
and both had drunk a good deal
selfe lost partie after partie and
eventually accused kennion of cheat-
ing words ran high boiled over into
blows and kennion in some rough
and tumble of wrestling and hitting
picked up a knife from the table and
stabbed selfe in the throat through
jugular vein and carotid artery in a
few minutes he had bled to death   
then kennion remembered that un-
answered bell and went tiptoe to
wadhams room he found it empty
empty too were the other rooms in
the flat had there been anyone there
his idea was to say he had come up at
selfes invitation and found him
dead but this was better yet there
was no more than a few spots of blood
on him and he washed them in wad-
hams room emptying the water into
his slop-pail then leaving the door of
the flat open he went downstairs and
out

  he told me this in quite a few
sentences even as i have told it you
and looked up at me with a smiling
face

   so whats to be done next ven-
erable father he said gayly

   ah thank god youve con-
fessed   i said  there is time yet to
save an innocent man you must give
yourself up to the police at once
but even as i spoke my heart mis-
gave me

  he rose dusting the knees of his
trousers

   what a quaint notion he said
but theres nothing farther from my
thoughts 

     i jumped up

     i shall go myself then  i said

    he laughed outright at that

   oh no indeed you wont he
said what about the seal of con-
fession indeed i rather fancy its
a deadly sin for a priest even to think
of violating it really im ashamed
of you my dear denys naughty

fellow but perhaps it was only a
joke you didnt mean it 

   i do mean it i said you shall
see if i mean it but even as i
spoke i knew i did not anything
is allowable to save an innocent man
from death

  he laughed again

   pardon me you know perfectly
well that it isnt he said theres
one thing in our creed far worse than
death and that is the damnation of
the soul youve gqt no intention of
damning yours i took no risk at all
when i confessed to you 

   but it will be murder if you
dont save this man i said

   oh certainly but ive got mur-
der on my conscience already he
said one gets used to it very quick-
ly and having got used to it an-
other murder doesnt seem to matter
an atom poor young wadham to-
morrow isnt it im not sure it
wont be a sort of rough justice
blackmail is a disgusting offense
i went to the telephone and took
off the receiver

   really this is most interesting
he said walton street is the near-
est police station you dont need
the number just say walton street
police but you cant you cant
say i have a man with me now
horace kennion who has confessed
to me that he murdered selfe so
why bluff besides if you could do
any such thing i shall merely say
that i had done nothing of the kind
your word the word of a priest who
has broken the most sacred vow
against mine childish 

   kennion i said for the love of
god as for the fear of hell give your-
self up what does it matter whether
you or i live a few years less if at
the end we pass into the vast infinite
with our sins confessed and forgiven
day and night i will pray for you 

   charming of you said he but
ive no doubt that now you will give
wadham full absolution so what
does it matter if he goes into-into


weird tales

the vast infinite at eight oclock to-
morrow morning

   why did you confess to me
then i asked if you had no inten-
tion of saving him and making
atonement

   well not long ago you were very
nasty to me he said you told me
no decent man would consult with
me so it struck me quite suddenly
only friday that it would be pleasant
to seeyou in the most awful hole i
daresay ive got sadie tastes too and
they are being wonderfully indulged
youre in torment you know you
would choose any physical agony
rather than to be in such a torture-
chamber of the soul its entrancing
i adore it thank you very much
denys

  he got up

   i kept my taxi waiting he said
no doubt youll be busy tonight
can i give you a lift anywhere pen-
tonville

  there are no words to describe
certain darknesses and ecstasies that
come to the soul and i can only tell
you that i can imagine no hell of re-
morse that could equal the hell that
i was in for in the bitterness of re-
morse we can see that our suffering is
a needful and salutary experience
only through it can our sin be burned
away but here was a torture blank
and meaningless and then my brain
stirred a little and i began to wonder
whether without breaking the seal of
confession i might not be able to
effect something i saw from my win-
dow that the light was burning in the
clock-tower at westminster the
house therefore was sitting and it
seemed possible that without viola-
tion i might tell the home secretary
that a confession had been made
me whereby i knew that wadham
was innocent he would ask me for
any details i could give him and i
could tell him and then i saw that
i could tell him nothing i could not
say that the murderer had gone up
with selfe to his room for through

that information it might be found
that kennion had dined with him
but before i did anything i must
have guidance and i went to the
cardinals house by our cathedral
he had gone to bed for it was now
after midnight but in answer to the
urgency of my request he came down
to see me i told him without giving
any clue what had happened and
his verdict was what in my heart i
knew it would be certainly i might
see the home secretary and tell him
that such a confession had been made
me but no word or hint must escape
me which could lead to identification
personally he did not see how the
execution could be postponed on such
information as i could give

   and whatever you suffer my
son he said be sure that you are
suffering not from having done
wrong but from having done right
placed as you are your temptation
to save an innocent man comes from
the devil and whatever you may be
called upon to endure for not yield-
ing to it is of that origin also

t saw the home secretary in his

  a room at the house within the
hour but unless i told him more-
and he realized that i could not-he
was powerless to move

   he wras found guilty at his
trial he said and his appeal was
dismissed without further evidence
i can do nothing-

  he sat thinking a moment then
jumped up

   good god its ghastly he said
i entirely believe i neednt tell you
that youve heard this confession but
that doesnt prove its true cant
you see the man again cant you
put the fear of god into him  if you
can do anything at all which gives
me any justification for acting up
till the moment the drop falls i will
give a reprieve at once theres my
telephone number ring me up here
or at my house at any hour

  i was back at the prison before
the hanging of alfred wadham



six in the morning i told wadham
that i believed in his innocence and
i gave him absolution for all else he
received the holy and blessed sacra-
ment with me and went without
flinching to his death

  father denys paused

  i have been a long time coming
to that point in my story he said
which concerns that seance you
spoke of but it was necessary for
your understanding of what i am
going to tell you now that you
should know all this i said that
those messages and communications
from the dead came not from them
but from some evil and awful power
impersonating them you answered
i remember why drag in the devil
i will tell you

vxthen it was over when the

  	 drop on which he stood
yawned open and the rope creaked
and jumped i went home it was a
dark winter morning still barely
light and in spite of the tragic scene
i had just witnessed i felt serene and
peaceful i did not think of ken-
nion at all only of the boy-he was
little more-who had suffered un-
justly and that it seemed a pitiful
mistake but no more it did not
touch him his essential living soul
it was as if he had suffered the sacred
expiation of martyrdom and i was
humbly thankful that i had been en-
abled to act rightly and had ken-
nion now through my agency been
in the hands of the police and wad-
ham alive i should have been branded
with the most terrible crime a priest
can commit i had been up all night
and after i had said my office i lay
down on my sofa to get a little sleep
and  dreamed that i was in the cell
with wadham and that he knew i
had proof of his innocence it was
within a few minutes of the hour of
his death and i heard along the stone-
flagged corridor outside the steps of
those who were coming for him he

heard them toe and stood up point-
ing at me

   youre letting an innocent man
die when you could save him he
said you cant do it father
denys father denys he shrieked
and the shriek broke off in a gulp
and a gasp as the door opened

  i woke knowing that what had
roused me was my own name
screamed out from somewhere close
at hand and i knew whose voice it
was but there i was alone in my
quiet empty room with the dim day
peering in i had been asleep  saw
for only a few minutes but now all
thought or power of sleep had fled
for somewhere by me invisible but
awfully present was the spirit of the
man whom i had allowed to perish
and he called me

  but presently i convinced my self
that this voice coming to me in sleep
was no more than a dream natural
enough in the circumstances and
some days passed tranquilly enough
and then one day when i was walk-
ing down a sunny crowded street i
felt some definite and dreadful chan 
in what i may call the psychic aimc--
phere which surrounds us all and my
soul grew black with fear and with
evil imaginings and there was wad-
ham coming toward me along tie
pavement gay and debonair be
looked at me and his face became a
mask of hate  we shall meet often
i hope father denys he said as he
passed another day i returned
home in the twilight and suddenly i
heard the creak and strain of a rope
and his body with head covered by
the death-cap swung in the window
against the sunset and sometimes
when i was at my books the door
opened quietly and closed again and
i knew he was there the apparition
or the token of it did not come often
or perhaps my resistance would have
been quickened for i knew it was
devilish in origin but it came when
i was off my guard at long intervals


weird tales

so that i thought i had vanquished
it and then sometimes i felt my faith
to reel but always it was preceded
by this sense of evil power bearing
down on me and i made haste to
seek the shelter of the house of de-
fense which is set very high and
then last sunday only-

  he broke off covering his eyes
with his hand as if shutting out some
appalling spectacle

  i had been preaching he re-
sumed   for one of our missions the
church was full and i do not think
there was another thought or desire
in my soul but to further the holy
cause for which i was speaking it
was a morning service and the sun
poured in through the stained win-
dows in glow of colored light but
in the middle of my sermon some
bank of cloud drove up and with it
this horrible forewarning of the ap-
proach of a tempest of evil so dark
it got that as i was drawing near the
end of my sermon the lights in the
church were switched on and it
leaped into brightness there was a
lamp on the desk in the pulpit where
i had placed my notes and now when
it was kindled it shone full on the pew
just below and there with his head
turned upward toward me with his
face purple and eyes protruding and
with the strangling noose round his
neck sat wadham

  my voice faltered and ceased and
i clutched at the pulpit-rail as he
stared at me and i at him a horror
of the spirit black as the eternal night
of the lost closed round me for i
had let him go innocent to his death
and my punishment was just    and
then like a star shining out through
some merciful rent in this soul-storm
came again that ray of conviction
that as a priest i could not have done
otherwise and with it the sure knowl-
edge that this apparition could not be
of god but of the devil to be re-
sisted and defied even as we defy
with contempt some sweet and in-

sidious temptation it could not there-
fore be the spirit of the man at which
i gazed but some diabolical counter-
feit and i looked back from him to
my notes and went on with my ser-
mon for that alone was my business
that pause had seemed to me eternal
it had the quality of timelessness but
i learned afterward that it had been
barely perceptible and from my
own heart i learned that it was no
punishment that i was undergoing
but the strengthening of a faith that
had faltered

suddenly he broke off there came
into his eyes as he fixed them on
the door a look not of fear at all but
of savage relentless antagonism

  its coming he said to me and
now if you hear or see anything de-
spise it for it is evil  

  the door swung open and closed
again and though nothing visible
entered i knew that there was now
in the room a living intelligence
other than father denys and mine
and it affected my being my self just
as some horrible odor of putrefaction
affects one physically my soul sick-
ened in it then still seeing noth-
ing i perceived that the room warm
and comfortable just now with a fire
of coal prospering in the grate was
growing cold and that some strange
eclipse was veiling the light close to
me on the table stood an electric
lamp the shade of it fluttered in the
icy draft that stirred in the air and
the illuminant wire was  longer in-
candescent but red and dull like the
embers in the grate

  i scrutinized the dimness but as
yet no material form manifested it-
self father denys was sitting very
upright in his chair his eyes fixed
and focused on something invisible to
me his lips were moving and mut-
tering  his hands grasped the crucifix
he was wearing and then i saw
what i knew he was seeing too a face
was outlining itself on the air in
the hanging of alfred wadham



front of him a face swollen and pur-
ple with tongue lolling from the
mouth and as it hung there it oscil-
lated to and fro clearer and clearer
it grew suspended there by the rope
that now became visible to me and
though the apparition was of a man
hanged by the neck it was not dead
but active and alive and the spirit
that awfully animated it was no
human one but something diabolical
suddenly father denys rose to his
feet and his face was within an inch
or two of that suspended horror he
raised his hands which held the sacred
emblem

   begone to your torment   he
cried until the days of it are over
and the mercy of god grants you
eternal death

tthkre rose a wailing in the air
some blast shook the room so that
the corners of it quaked and then the
light and the warmth were restored
to it and there was no one there but
our two selves father denys face
was haggard and dripping with the
struggle he had been through but
there shone on it such radiance as i

have never seen on human counte-
ance

  its over he said i saw it
shrivel and wither before the power
of his presence    and your eyes
tell me you saw it too and you know
now that what wore the semblance of
humanity was pure evil  

  we talked a little longer and he
rose to go

  ah i forgot he said you
wanted to know how i could reveal to
you what was told me in confession
horace kennion died this morning by
his own hand he left with his law-
yer a packet to be opened on his
death with instructions that it should
be published in the daily press i saw
it in an evening paper and it was a
detailed account of how he killed ger-
ald selfe he wished it to have all
possible publicity

  but why i asked

  father denys paused

  he gloried in his wickedness i
think he said he loved it as i
told you for its own sake and he
wanted everyone to know of it as
soon as he was safely away

an examination
in diplomacy

 by edith m almedingen

he had not enough daring to
tell them he did not want to
be assigned to that particu-
lar post they would have laughed at
him had he ventured to give an out-
let to his vague fears a trusted tool
of the tcheka afraid to spend a few
nights on duty at the paul castle
just because he had happened to hear
some old womans tales about its
being haunted glebov realized that
his bold hopes of rapid promotion
would have been dashed to the
ground had the chief but caught one
glimpse of the almost animal terror
in his heart so ho merely bit his
lips and lashed himself into a sham
attitude of glad readiness so good
of the chief to think so highly of him
glebov certainly hed try and do his
utmost and he added a few more
similar commonplaces before leav-
ing the grim tcheka house a fateful
mandate to the commandant of the
castle in his pocket

  glebovs duty did not begin till a
few hours later these he spent in
breathless feverish activities care-
fully abstaining from drink during
the day ones mind had to be
clear before an emergency- he
thought and following an unac-
countable trend of reasoning he had
his pockets well stuffed with num-
bers of the atheist its pages gave
one food for thinking on the right
lines convinced one that things
supernatural were impotent to

 m

frighten because they did not exist
i have not been attending all those
anti-religious lectures for nothing
glebov tried to comfort himself and
by dint of heroic efforts he well-
nigh managed to conquer his fears
when it was time for him to go up
to the castle

  but no sooner had he crossed the
sinister drawbridge no sooner had
the castle gates slammed to behind
him than he became aware that if
anything his fears were as mighty
as ever before his very tread sharp
against the worn flagstones of the
dark deserted courtyard was ex-
pressive of those fears he cast an
upward look at the gloomy light -
less walls around him and all at
once his treacherous mind remem-
bered the details of the ghastly
tragedy enacted within those very
same walls more than one hundred
years ago yes that was why evert
the bravest of the brave men held
the castle to be haunted for the
emperor paul met here with a most
violent death and his son and suc-
cessor shunned the place like a
plague-cemetery of old and none of
the later sovereigns even dreamt of
living here and the tchekist shud-
dered as though visualizing the
loathsome details of that scene on
the eleventh of march  he had
read all about it in some old book
or other he now wished he had
not because the pictures rose in his
an examination tn diplomacy



mind suddenly umvantedly and lie
could not clear his vision from its
blood-curdling details the emperor
cornered in a back study of his mad-
ly spinning round and round the
table to evade the murderous touch
of his enemies and finally captured
pinned down to the floor four cruelly
determined hands clasping at his
throat clasping tighter tighter tight-
er till all life went out of the small
wizened body and the curse of a foul
crime descended upon the castle to
darken it for the generations that
were to come

  yes the tchekist remembered all
that and half-way down the yard
he stopped as though struck by
lightning the eleventh of march
and was not this very day the
eleventh of march also

  his blood ran cold his forehead
was bathed in clammy sweat his
reason alone the reason of a well-
trained and hardened communist
urged him to go on after all these
things had their existence only in the
befogged minds of those poor de-
ranged folk who would not be per-
suaded to cease from believing in
that strange god of theirs he ivan
glebov was gloriously free from all
such prejudices the party would
scarcely have trusted him so touch
if it were proved that he too was
tainted with these puerile super-
stitions but for all his reasoning
his hands felt unpleasantly clammy
and his heart beat terrifically fast as
he crossed the threshold of the com-
mandants lodge

nphe commandant was glad to see
him vodka and cigarettes were
produced at owe but glebov stoical-
ly resisted the temptation

  i have work to do comrade he
explained somewhat lamely see
i have brought all these papers with
me so f must keep my mind clear

  as you like acquiesced the
stout pig-faced commandant of

course you know this is hardly an
enviable job taken all around the
teheka must send us their bravest
men  

  glebov pricked his cars

  why not exactly an enviable
job he asked making an almost
superhuman effort to remain quiet

surely the responsibility-

  the commandant waved his fat
hand impatiently

   oh the responsibility is all right
rather too much of it you see we
have reasons to believe that those
accursed counter-revolutionaries are
keen on making their headquarters
in this old castle wc have not been
able to trace them as yet-too many
unexplored cellars and rooms under-
ground he added almost apolo-
getically

  true diplomatic sense prompted
glebov to pass no comment  these
remarks lie was not going to wan-
der about the unexplored regions of
the castle thank you

  the commandant went on and
there are all sorts of queer stories
running about the place you know
-deftly he shifted his viewpoint-
no use talking about them to a
tchekist is there

  i think not glebov forced a
short laugh grandmothers tales
about its being haunted and all that
rot eh

 quite comrade the man
joined in the laugh things unfit
for enlightened citizens liko our-
selves to listen to

glebov duly took over the night
charge of the castle from the
commandant made a careful round
of the premises without descending
underground however looked over
the numerous sentry posts and bal
certain that things seemed all right
went to his own particular den a
spacious well-lieated well-furn-hett
room on the second floor with a bal

cony overlooking the quiet slumber-
ing courtyard

  he lit the candles on the big em-
pire table in the middle of the room
and switched off the electric light
the latter always gave a funny
nervous pain to his eyes and he
really wanted to work that night-
to read and reread those precious
atheistic pamphlets which stuffed
his pockets and thus to force his
mind to turn to sane rational think-
ing such as befitted a true servant
of the soviet republic

  a filled decanter some glasses
and an invitingly open box of choice
cigarettes were placed on a tray on
the writing-table glebov looked at
them longingly for a moment then
pushed them aside a stern expres-
sion on his usually expressionless
face drink would be perilous and
smoking was likely to fog his mind

  he settled himself very comfort-
ably in the velvet-covered armchair
stretched out his rather tired legs
and began delving through articles
in the atheist yes that was the one
he specially wanted to find the im-
possibility of ghostly happenings

  the crudely violent unlearned
language of the paper was familiar
to him he had heard these things
time and again shouted from various
platforms urged by wild-eyed
fanatical individuals whose sole ob-
jective in this life seemed to be the
raising of an insurmountable barrier
between its course and the possi-
bility of any further immaterial
existence

  glebovs parched tongue flicked
over his lips as lie read on of
course he must have been utterly
insane even to allow such stupid
ideas the right of entering his mind
at all here he was all alone in the
middle of the night in that same old
dreaded castle and nothing was
happening and nothing was likely to
happen these things could not
exist supernatural indeed super-

natural rubbish really he might
indulge in just one tiny drink

  he filled his glass slowly and de-
liberately and held it against the
light they knew how to provide
for their best workers did the
tcheka chiefs he sniffed the amber
contents golly if it was not real
british whisky glebov chuckled as
he noisily gulped it down most
likely the happy result of a raid on
some dirty englishmans house
well it served a much better pur-
pose now glebov smacked his lips
and helped himself to a cigarette

 wonderful chaps to write so
clearly and helpfully he muttered
scanning over a virulent paper on
christian mythology such things
should be translated into all lan-
guages

  he laid down the paper leant back
luxuriously and puffed at his cig-
arette it was really wonderful
what two short hours of sane reading
had done to him gone were his
imbecile anxieties his vague dis-
turbing fears he was a fully
fledged tcheka communist who
feared neither god nor the devil be-
cause he denied both

  glebov looked at his expensive
gold watch nearly twenty-five
minutes to  he would make an-
other round at midnight would it
not be lucky if he caught some real
counter-revolutionists and red-
handed too rosy-tinted thoughts
of amazingly quick promotion sped
through his mind

 the one and only door at the
farthest end of the room gave a
gentle squeak glebov started   
no how silly of him of course he
had not locked the door and the wind
was gently blowing from the half-
opened window why he wondered
should the window be opened sud-
denly he felt chilly-because it was
march-and the eleventh of march
as well ominous recollections at-
an examination in diplomacy



tached to the date again crowded
into his mind

  he would ring for the sentry pres-
ently he did not feel like getting
up and shutting the door himself
after all if these things were non-
existent as they most certainly
were he hastened to assure himself
still one had to mind ones nerves
just a little

  he shivered again the wind was
getting decidedly chilly but he
knew it would be unwise to ring for
the sentry before midnight the
chiefs were known to lend their ears
to quite unfounded stories and it
might then be said of him that he
was actually scared

    lebov held out his hand towaid
 the decanter just another drink
would help steady his nerves his
eyes fell on the hideously blasphe-
mous cartoon on the papers page ly-
ing open in front of him somehow
he did not like the eartoon really
a bit too thick he thought and
turned the page over

  then he refilled the glass which
was never meant to reach his lips
for at that moment the door gave
another gentle squeak opened wider
and a dark-eloaked middle-sized fig-
ure stepped into the room

  from the table where glebov sat
he could just face the door his blood
turned to ice he wanted to scream
but his lips were frozen into silence
the only sound heard was the crash
of the glass and the steady drip-drip
of the spilt whisky

  for a terribly long moment the
strange figure stood immobile then
it moved slowly toward the table-
slowly just one step at a time the
fitful candle-light lent a grotesque
uncertainty to its outline but
glebovs terror-stricken mind could
still register a few definite details
the man was of middle height wore
a loose dark cloak and as ho made
another step nearer the table the

hapless tchekists terror increased
hundredfold tho stranger had that
peculiar tricorne hat so common in
the period of the emperor paul gleb-
ov knew it he had seen some pic-
tures his hands clutched at the
table his eyes stared ahead frozen
in their look of utter terror

  because it was he the victim of
that foul crime committed in these
very walls   

  glebovs brain battled for a
scream hut his lips were too inert to
obey and the cloaked figure all the
more terrible because of his silence
was advancing one step at a time
slowly revengefully  yes revenge-
fully one sovereign about to settle
the score for another   

  glebov would not look at the face
 he would not see it    the bell
was out of reach he could not move
a muscle    what was there to do
except-

  he remembered and the swift
recolloction prompted him to stag-
ger to his shaking feet yes they
did exist then was there not a
prayer against all evil ghosts his
grandmother had taught him to say
when as a boy he was fearful of
going to sleep in a dark room what
was it oh- curse it he could not
remember a word and he knew that
unless he uttered it the strange
cloaked figure would be upon him
and seize him by the throat and
strangle him even as he had been
strangled more than one hundred
years ago

  the figure made another step the
world turned black for glebov
wildly he stretched out his trem-
bling arms as though pushing the
stranger away from him and then
with the vilest of vile oaths fell
down in a limp heap

yearly the next morning the little
- stout commandant trotted to the
tcheka headquarters the thin
searred-face chief received him in a

old mark

by august w derleth

the city of newport wales
looms on the horizon of
caerleon-on-usk threatening
to crush the ancient city of isca
silurum dating back to nero sixth
of the caesars once the headquarters
of the second augustan legion under
hadrian the tentacles of industrial-
ism are reaching out toward caer-
leon-on-usk ancient capital of bri-
tannia secunda standing upon the
ground once trod by hadrian and
his legions

  had it not been for hadrian and
his great wall mr carson fielding
would never have attracted my at-
tention mr carson fielding had es-
tablished for himself an enviable
reputation as archeologist-every li-
brary in britain contained copies of
his papers on the roman occupation

  the archeologist arrived at caer-
leon-on-usk early in april and for
almost a month he pursued his ex-
plorations unheard from then sud-
denly in may the english press be-
gan to give frequent columns to the
opposition of the archeologist to the
english government which had just-
ly forbidden him to excavate the

roman camp  the ground that it
had already been thoroughly gone
over by men in the employ of the
government itself mr carson field-
ing had it appeared written a fiery
letter to the press concerning the
injustice of the government the
letter had attracted considerable at-
tention and after a decent interval
sir arthur morley wrote a full page
article on the eccentric mr field-
ing   whatever mr carson fielding
had to say about this article is not
known for it is certain that nothing
appeared in the papers for several
months nothing more was heard of the
activities of the archeologist at caer-
leon-on-usk

  he was again brought to the atten-
tion of the public by a fourth-page
advertisement announcing the publi-
cation of a posthumous volume of
papers by the late mr carson field-
ing by the house of mead  howells
ltd it developed that the late
fielding had died at his temporary
home at caerleon-on-usk under cir-
cumstances that avere being investi-
gated by relatives of the dead man
nothing was ever discovered and for
old mark



the public the last heard of the
areheologist was the suppression of
his posthumous volume of papers be-
cause of several wildly impossible
essays on ancient roman and dru-
idistic magic which the government
deemed better unprinted

  it was mr carson fielding who
had written a very interesting paper
in my possession on the subject of
marcus vibius gal acinus legendary
roman-celtic wizard of caerleon-on-
usk it was popularly believed that
this ancient person had held the
countryside in a terrorizing grasp
due to his control of black magic
even today mothers can be heard
warning their children not to loiter
after dark telling them that if they
do old mark will get them there
are innumerable legends current
about him but perhaps the best and
most widely known of them is the
legend of old marks familiar who
it was averred by several had been
drawn in part from the earth in
part from the waters of the world
and finished from the air of the uni-
verse it was told in the best houses
of how this creature from another
world did the bidding of old mark
of how the wizards enemies were
visited by fire and flood and of how
many of them were found dead their
heads crushed as if by some hideous
gigantic hand

  it is told that one day this hideous
monstrosity turned against its master
and killed him and of how old
mark stronger than his familiar
even after death rose up against the
thing to send it back to the place
whence it came and of how the
wizard sent his lifeless body sham-
bling across the fields toward the
roman villas bearing under his arm
an hidebound bag some say a casket
in which he had imprisoned the
creature from outside he was never
after seen nor was any trace of him
ever discovered

  later in the same month of oc-
tober that had witnessed the death

of the areheologist i had occasion to
visit the rector of the church at
caerleon-on-usk it was because i
required the assistance of this ven-
erable pastor on a paper of mine that
i called upon him i had not in-
tended to make any sort of stay but
it developed to my pleasure that he
was able to aid me in a number of
ways and i was constrained upon to
stay with him for a week

  the rectors home stood just
across a picturesque street from the
church a rather recentbuilding in
the gothic style beyond its spires
one could see the open country and
off to the left on a hill stood all
that was left of the ancient seat of
the second augustan legion one of
the spots under government super-
vision the entire country impressed
me most favorably it was like a
personification of beauty i remem-
ber looking out toward the ruins on
the hill trying to imagine the corpse
of old mark moving toward it over
the fields

  i hope sir said the rector
showing me to my room that you
have no objection to staying in a
room in which a man was supposed
to have been murdered

  none at alli saidand laughed
how long ago was he murdered
only this month mr sinclair
ho opened the door of the room
it was a small room containing only
a narrow bed a heavy oak desk two
chairs and a seven-armed candela-
brum a worn rug covered the floor
and the one window was hidden by
the folds of a faded curtain through
which i could see the limbs of a yew
the room however had an appear-
ance of comfoit

  perhaps you remember mr car-
son fielding asked the ieetor

  of course was he actually mur-
dered

  no one has proved it he
laughed but his death was a bit
queer that heavy candelabrum had
evidently fallen and struck him on


weird tales

the head it looked as if he had been
killed at once i know because i
found him there was a most pe-
culiar expression of terror on his face
-positively unnerving mr sinclair
positively unnerving  

  	 odd the papers said nothing of
it

  oh theres a lot the papers
wont get everybody seems to think
that it was perfectly natural for that
candelabrum to fall and kill mr
fielding and no one thought it at
all important that it had never fallen
before-nor after for that matter
it isnt very easy to knock over
either

  he could have knocked it over
though couldnt he

  confidentially mr sinclair he
could not mr fielding was found
dead at his desk his head had fallen
forward there was a horrible gash
in the back of it both his arms hung
at his sides the candelabrum was
on the mantel seven feet behind him
before his death after it was found
on the floor about two feet from the
desk he couldnt conceivably have
placed it in its holder which inci-
dentally is just above his head

  why not and why couldnt it
have slipped out the theory would
work

  thats what the coroner thought
and what his relatives were per-
suaded into believing but examine
the holder yourself mr sinclair
youll see that in order to have
slipped out the iron circle or loop
at the bottom would have had to be
opened it wasnt and besides even
if it had opened who closed it again
for it was closed when i found mr
fielding the coroner said it slipped
shut again-a most remarkable mind
that man had he didnt try to prove
it though

  i walked to the window and drew
aside the curtain i looked out at the
yew tree the rector must have
guessed my thoughts for he spoke
again

  yes he said the window was
open mr sinclair but you can eas-
ily see that the yew is too far away
for anyone to have entered that way
this rectory is a three-story build-
ing and as this room is on the second
floor the distances from both roof
and ground are about equal and both
rather of a risk i had the roof
examined in fact i examined it my-
self and the ground also there
wasnt a trace of anything besides
mr fielding sat facing the window
hed have noticed if anything came
in through the window after all he
was struck down from behind
couldnt one of your own ser-
vants or perhaps someone that got

into the house- i began

    that was the very first theory to
be discarded mr sinclair the door
was locked on the inside we had to
break it in theres a new lock on
it now

  you dont seem to offer any solu-
tion do you i laughed

  i dont pretend to i dont be-
lieve there is any-at least not one
that i could understand for a
moment he was silent do you
know very much about your mr car-
son fielding mr sinclair

  well no i dont except that he
was an extraordinarily good arche-
ologist  

  id always thought that too mr
sinclair but it seemed to me that the
man was a bit-well you know a bit
balmy he was rather a frightened
man at the last afraid i suppose
of the government for he had been
making secret excavations here and
there

  i dont think that the govern-
ment was aware of that

  nor do i but what else could
he have been frightened of he
didnt impress me as the sort of man
that could easily be frightened he
wasnt either by the way i ob-
served the other day that his latest
work had been barred from the pub-
lic have you read of it at all
old mark



  nothing beyond a notice of its
publication and suppression why do
you ask

  ive a copy somewhere about the
house-one of mr fieldings proof
copies that he let me keep if you
care to read it you may there are
some mighty queer passages in the
essays in the last half of the book
some of them sound almost as if they
had been written by a madman ive
never read the like before and ive
studied witchcraft and the occult

tn the morning i found the book
-i on my desk i glanced hastily
through it and put it down again to
read when i returned from the ro-
man ruins whither i was bound the
rector had indicated to me the spots
where the archeologist had excavat-
ed and i was determined to examine
them possibly with the thought of
becoming famed through some dis-
covery of importance

  i went over one place after anoth-
er and came at last to a series of
flat tiles somewhat overgrown by
moss one of which fielding had
pulled away i remember that i had
no difficulty in discovering it at the
moment beneath it i found a small
silver urn the seals of which had
been broken on the side was a latin
inscription which i had some little
difficulty in reading it ran half-way
round the urn and read

integritys extra si non intra

 the seals of the urn had been
broken and that recently i won-
dered not a little why fielding had
not taken this obviously roman relic
away to his room to study at his
leisure i was sure that it was field-
ing who had broken the seals i
smuggled the urn under my coat
and went directly to my room in-
tending to return on the morrow and
resume my investigations

  i examined the urn intently there
was nothing extraordinary about it
except perhaps the puzzling inscrip-

tion it was of plain silver the
seals were those of hadrian it was
i knew a common practise to cre-
mate the dead in rome and to bury
them in urns such as this conse-
quently i was considerably aston-
ished to find no trace whatsoever of
ashes on the inside of the urn
though i examined it with my read-
ing-glass there was nothing to indi-
cate that there had ever been ashes
in the urn i assumed that fielding
had removed the ashes-though for
what reason i could not conjecture-
and then washed the urn and re-
placed it the theory is ridiculous
i know but at the time it did not
occur to me that the urn might never
have been occupied by ashes of some
dead roman i recall now that the
urn was peculiarly warm to the
touch

  i	put the urn safely away and
turned my attention to the work of
fieldings the first half of the book
dealt almost entirely with the ro-
man occupation the last half of it
was composed of a collection of
papers on weird rites of old roman
and briton wizards the last paper
in the volume was very disconnected
and had about it an air of great
haste as if the author somehow
realized that this would be the last
thing he would ever write and was
in haste to finish it one passage in
it attracted my attention at once it
was a paragraph and it began with
the same latin inscription that i had
found on the silver urn

      this inscription is supposed to
have been found on numerous containers of
all kinds-urns bottles jars also on wood
carvings stones and in some cases trees
very little proof is at hand however and
what there is can be questioned there are
many things we know not of-many things
that were never meant for human eye it
is said that if the seals of these urns jars
or bottles are broken or if the stones are
cracked open or if the trees are chopped
down incredible things will happen to the
perpetrator what are these things and
what will bring them about is it possible
that there are living entities that no eye
has seen-no ear has heard-no hand has


weird tales

touched there is a story of solomon and
the genii of evil

  it was this paragraph that first
gave me an inkling of the real mean-
ing behind the latin inscription un-
fortunately i did not act at once or
perhaps i could have prevented what
happened three days afterward but
i am going ahead of my story

hphat night as i undressed for bed
i noticed on my right breast a
brownish discoloration of the skin
which bore a remarkable resem-
blance to a burn it did not hurt
when i touched it nor could i re-
move any part of it it was curious-
ly like an x-ray burn and i had no
idea where it could have come from
i examined it for some moments in
silence before it occurred to me that
the mark was somewhat like the out-
line of the urn i reflected immedi-
ately that it was just above this burn
that i had smuggled the urn under
my coat there was i was certain
some connection perhaps the ro-
mans had treated this silver with
some sort of acid yet there was no
mark upon my clothes i gave it up
after a while and tumbled into bed

  somewhat after midnight i awoke
the first time after having had
troubled dreams of the urn and its
latin words which i seemed to see
written in great letters of flame upon
a lurid red sky and before which
countless people were fleeing the
thought of the urn bothered me and

	got up to see whether it was safe
it was still where i had placed it
before retiring-in the chest opposite
my bed i went back to bed and
lay for some time simulating sleep
but i could not sleep i stared out
of the open window it was a calm
night without a breath of air i
looked back into the room a vague
sense of uneasiness stealing over me
then at last i sank into a light sleep

  i woke up the second time at about

	oclock there was a peculiar feel-
ing of cold in the room and the cur-

tains at the window were swaying
to and fro under the impetus of a
wind that had arisen i was absurd-
ly frightened at something though
at what i could not tell i looked
sleepily around my eye caught sight
of something vaguely suggestive a
little to one side of the chest i sat
up startled but there was nothing
though i could have taken an oath
that i had seen evil eyes glaring at
me i was by now thoroughly awake
and i slipped on my dressing-gown
and put on the light the room was
as i had left it at retiring and the
wind from outside had quieted down
-strangely soon i reflected

  i sat up the rest of the night and
read

for the next three days i labored
with the rector on my paper but
for some reason i could not concen-
trate and i found myself constantly
revising portion after portion i con-
fess that the thought of the urn and
of the strange latin words bothered
me not a little why this should dis-
turb me i could not say nor do i
now make any attempt to explain
my disquieted feelings

  on the third night the final scene
of what was destined to be one of
the most remarkable occurrences of
my life began it was as before
soon after midnight when i awoke
from a sleep fully as troubled as that
of the first night i had dreamed
again of the urn and of the latin
words which had by this time
grown to enormous proportions in
my mind i dreamed too of an un-
thought-of monster a great loath-
some creature who sought his way
through caerleon-on-usk striking
down victim after victim i dreamed
that he caught sight of me pursued
me and took me in one of his gi-
gantic paws and leered at me i
screamed aloud it was then that i
awoke shuddering

  when i opened my eyes i lay fac-
ing the chest judge my horror if
old mark



you can when i saw hovering above
the chest the same malevolent face
of my dream i lay immobile frozen
with terror there was an undulat-
ing black cloud about the chest and
in the midst of it i could faintly see
a jumble of fiery latin words five of
which stood out plainly

interitvs extra si non intra

  for a moment i thought that i
imagined it then i screamed again
and drew my head beneath the cov-
ers the last i saw was the cloud of
black moving toward the window
the curtains seemed to open to meet
it

  when i looked again all was nor-
mal in the room i got up horribly
shaken turned on the light and made
my way downstairs for a glass of
water i had scarcely turned the tap
when a chilling scream of fright
echoed from outside

   i ran to the door and flung it wide
on the stairs behind me i could hear
the rector the moon was out and
half in the shadow cast by the church
across its stone steps and half out
lay the body of a man together
the rector and i ran over to him it
was the sexton and he was dead a
horrible gash in his crushed head
still spilling blood close by in the
shadow lay the weapon the crime
had been committed with the lector
moved over toward it

  my god he cried sharply
how did this get here

   he pointed a shaking finger at the
weapon i took a step forward and
recognized it it was the seven-armed
candelabrum from my room

  for a moment we stood in stupe-
fied amazement before the weapon
but only for a moment for suddenly
the solution of all that had been hap-
pening for the last few days-all
that had started with the murder of
fielding and had culminated with
the death of the sexton-burst upon
me and with that knowledge came
the knowledge that i had been chosen

to nip in the bud such a scourge as
had never yet threatened any civi-
lized city

  i looked cautiously around to as-
sure myself that no one was in sight
then i bent down snatched up the
weapon and with the rector ran
back toward the house leaving the
dead man to be discovered by some-
one else i replaced the candela-
brum then i sought out the last of
fieldings works and again read the
last essay which by now had as-
sumed an altogether different mean-
ing i discovered too penciled notes
in the back of the volume which i
had not seen before had it not been
for these perhaps the evil thing that
had been loosed upon caerleon-on-
usk would still be at large

  listen i said and read to the
rector

  born before man out of fire these
daemons inhabit the domain of humanity
they can it is said be exorcised and this
simply a blessed crucifix burnt in the
urn    there is too a wind that blows
evil tilings at night things we know
not of    picture to yourself the spectacle
of an old mans corpse loping across the
fields carrying under his dead arm an urn
in which is one of these things

  have you a blessed crucifix any-
where i asked the rector

  yes yes he answered quickly
i will get it

  he left the room and i read on
through the notes scattered all over
the unlettered pages in the back of
the volume it must be done by
one man alone i read and when
the rector returned with the crucifix
i read it aloud to him signifying
that i was the one to do the thing
still somewhat shaken the rector
left the room and immediately i set
myself to the task

itook the urn placed it in the
center of the floor and put into it
the crucifix i put out the light then
tried for some moments to ignite the
cross at last i succeeded thrust it
back into the urn and moved some


weird tales

distance away to await developments
as yet i was not wholly satisfied
with the connection of the urn to the
dead man on the church steps

  but what doubts i still retained
were soon dispersed for suddenly a
terrific burst of wind blew wide the
curtains on the windows after it
came a cloud of black like smoke
that swirled in impotent fury above
the urn the swirling motion re-
solved at last into a gentle undulat-
ing sway the walls of the room be-
came invisible and instead there was
a sort of greenish glow a pano-
rama opened out before my aston-
ished eyes-opened onto the roman
ruins on the hill behind the church
i saw an old man garbed in a black
toga bending over the tiles of the
flooring lifting one of them and
thrusting beneath it an urn then
suddenly the scene changed but
flashed back again with a different
figure on the landscape it was none
other than mr carson fielding i
saw him go over the tiles coming at
last to that identical one i myself
had lifted not so long ago he
stooped and removed it and drew
from it the urn he looked around
him then broke the seals unnoticed
by him a great black thing emerged
and vanished into the sky disap-
pointed he replaced the urn and
moved away then abruptly the
scene vanished and the black cloud
began to swirl about the room t
caught a vivid glimpse of the fire in
the urn

  i felt now that the thing was in
the room hidden by the blackness
of a sudden i caught sight of long

grotesque arms waving to and fro
and of a maniacal face twisted into
horrible fury abruptly i felt the
full current of its malefic power di-
lected straight at me out of the pit
of blackness that had taken form
shot a stream of fire a red glow suf-
fused the black cloud and in a mo-
ment i felt a terrific heat the
stream of fire from the cloud was
taking visible form-it was dividing
and redividing-forming the words
of the latin inscription behind this
fiery warning appeared the most
awful face that i have ever seen or
ever imagined in the depths of slum-
ber i was numb with fright

  all at once the words formed a sort
of cone shape the leering mouth of
the dasmon opened wide and closed
and the face now brightly red pre-
ceded by those fiery words came di-
rectly at me

  that is all that i remember i
awoke to find the anxious rector
bending over me i was all right
the rector said that he had heard me
scream then a terrific noise as of a
thunderclap had shaken the house
when he entered he found me on the
floor the urn had utterly vanished
but on the floor where it had been
lay a fine faint sifting of ashes
formed into the words

interitvs extra si non intra

  and on the following day an old
woman who lived on the outskirts of
the town came to the rector with a
story of having seen old mark run-
ning across the fields to the ruins at
his side a lean black shape like that
of a dog
his unconquerable enemy

by w c morrow

was summoned from calcutta to
the heart of india to perform a
difficult surgical operation on one
of the women of a great rajas house-
hold i found the raja a man of a
noble character but possessed as i
afterward discovered of a sense of
cruelty purely oriental and in con-
trast to the indolence of his disposi-
tion he was so grateful for the suc-
cess that attended my mission that he
urged me to remain a guest at the pal-
ace as long as it might please me to
stay and i thankfully accepted the
invitation

  one of the male servants early at-
tracted my notice for his marvelous
capacity of malice his name was
neranya and i am certain that there
must have been a large proportion of
malay blood in his veins for unlike
the indians from whom he differed
also in complexion he was extreme-
ly alert active nervous and sensitive
a redeeming circumstance was his
love for his master once his violent
temper led him to the commission of
an atrocious crime-the fatal stabbing
of a dwarf in punishment for this
the raja ordered that neranyas right
arm the offending one be severed
from his body the sentence was ex-
ecuted in a bungling fashion by a stu-

pid fellow armed with an ax and i
being a surgeon was compelled in
order to save neranyas life to per-
form an amputation of the stump
leaving not a vestige of the limb re-
maining

  after this he developed an aug-
mented fiendishness his love for the
raja was changed to hate and in his
mad anger he flung discretion to the
winds driven once to frenzy by the
rajas scornful treatment he sprang
upon the raja with a knife but
fortunately was seized and disarmed
to his unspeakable dismay the raja
sentenced him for this offense to suffer
amputation of the remaining arm it
was done as in the former instance
this had the effect of putting a tem-
porary curb on neranyas spirit or
rather of changing the outward man-
ifestations of his diabolism being
armless he was at first largely at the
mercy of those who ministered to his
needs-a duty which i undertook to
see was properly discharged for i felt
an interest in this strangely distorted
nature his sense of helplessness
combined with a damnable scheme
for revenge which he had secretly
formed caused neranya to change his
fierce impetuous and unruly conduct
into a smooth quiet insinuating bear-


weird tales

ing which he carried so artfully as to
deceive those with whom he was
brought in contact including the raja
himself

  neranya being exceedingly quick
intelligent and dexterous and hav-
ing an unconquerable will turned his
attention to the cultivating of an en-
larged usefulness of his legs feet and
toes with so excellent effect that in
time he was able to perform wonder-
ful feats with those members thus
his capability especially for destruc-
tive mischief was considerably re-
stored

  one morning the rajas only son a
young man of an uncommonly ami-
able and noble disposition was found
dead in bed his murder was a most
atrocious one his body being muti-
lated in a shocking manner but in my
eyes the most significant of all the
mutilations was the entire removal
and disappearance of the young
princes arms

  the death of the young man nearly
brought the raja to the grave it
was not therefore until i had nursed
him back to health that i began a
systematic inquiry into the murder
i said nothing of my own discoveries
and conclusions until after the raja
and his officers had failed and my
work had been done then i submitted
to him a written report making a
close analysis of all the circumstances
and closing by charging the crime to
neranya the raja convinced by my
proof and argument at once ordered
neranya to be put to death this to be
accomplished slowly and with fright-
ful tortures the sentence was so
cruel and revolting that it filled me
with horror and i implored that the
wretch be shot finally through a
sense of gratitude to me the raja re-
laxed when neranya was charged
with the crime he denied it of course
but seeing that the raja was con-
vinced he threw aside all restraint
and dancing laughing and shrieking
in the most horrible manner confessed
his guilt gloated over it and reviled

the raja to his teeth-this knowing
that some fearful death awaited him

  the raja decided upon the details
of the matter that night and in the
morning he informed me of his de-
cision it was that neranyas life
should be spared but that both of his
legs should be broken with hammers
and that then i should amputate the
limbs at the trunk appended to this
horrible sentence was a provision that
the maimed wretch should be kept and
tortured at regular intervals by such
means as afterward might be devised

  sickened to the heart by the awful
duty set out for me i nevertheless
performed it with success and i care
to say nothing more about that part
of the tragedy neranya escaped
death very narrowly and was a long
time in recovering his wonted vitality
during all these weeks the raja
neither saw him nor made inquiries
concerning him but when as in duty
bound i made official report that the
man had recovered his strength the
rajas eyes brightened and he
emerged with deadly activity from
the stupor into which he so long had
been plunged

the rajas palace was a noble struc-
ture but it is necessary here to
describe only the grand hall it was
an immense chamber with a floor of
polished inlaid stone and a lofty
arched ceiling a soft light stole into
it through stained glass set in the roof
and in high windows on one side in
the middle of the room was a rich
fountain which threw up a tall slen-
der column of water with smaller and
shorter jets grouped around it across
one end of the hall half-way to the
ceiling was a balcony which com-
municated with the upper story of a
wing and from which a flight of stone
stairs descended to the floor of the
hall during the hot summers this
room was delightfully cool it was the
rajas favorite lounging-place and
when the nights were hot he had his
cot taken thither and there he slept
his unconquerable enemy



  this hall was chosen for neranyas
permanent prison here was he to stay
so long as he might live with never
a glimpse of the shining world or the
glorious heavens to one of his nerv-
ous discontented nature such con-
finement was worse than death at
the rajas order there was constructed
for him a small pen of open iron-
work circular and about four feet
in diameter elevated on four slender
iron posts ten feet above the floor
and placed between the balcony and
the fountain such was neranyas
prison the pen was about four feet
in depth and the pen-top was left
open for the convenience of the serv-
ants whose duty it should be to care
for him these precautions for his
safe confinement were taken at my
suggestion for although the man was
now deprived of all four of his limbs
i still feared that he might develop
some extraordinary unheard-of pow-
er for mischief it was provided that
the attendants should reach his cage
by means of a movable ladder

  all these arrangements having been
made and neranya hoisted into his
cage the raja emerged upon the bal-
cony to see him for the first time since
the last amputation neranya had
been lying panting and helpless on the
floor of his cage but when his quick
ear caught the sound of the rajas
footfall he squirmed about until he
had brought the back of his head
against the railing elevating his eyes
above his chest and enabling him to
peer through the open-work of the
cage thus the two deadly enemies
faced each other the rajas stern
face paled at sight of the hideous
shapeless thing which met his gaze
but he soon recovered and the old
hard cruel sinister look returned
neranyas black hair and beard had
grown long and they added to the
natural ferocity of his aspect his
eyes blazed upon the raja with a ter-
rible light his lips parted and he
gasped for breath his face was ashen

with rage and despair and his thin
distended nostrils quivered

  the raja folded his arms and gazed
down from the balcony upon the
frightful wreck that he had made
oh the dreadful pathos of that pic-
ture the inhumanity of it the deep
and dismal tragedy of it who might
look into the wild despairing heart of
the prisoner and see and understand
the frightful turmoil there the surg-
ing choking passion unbridled but
impotent ferocity frantic thirst for a
vengeance that should be deeper than
hell neranya gazed his shapeless
body heaving his eyes aflame and
then in a strong clear voice which
rang throughout the great hall with
rapid speech he hurled at the raja
the most insulting defiance the most
awful curses he cursed the womb
that had conceived him the food that
should nourish him the wealth that
had brought him power cursed him in
the name of buddha and all the wise
men cursed by the sun the moon
and the stars by the continents
mountains oceans and rivers by all
things living cursed his head his
heart his entrails cursed in a whirl-
wind of unmentionable words heaped
unimaginable insults and contumely
upon him called him a knave a beast
a fool a liar an infamous and un-
speakable coward

  the raja heard it all camly without
the movement of a muscle without the
slightest change of countenance and
when the poor wretch had exhausted
his strength and fallen helpless and
silent to the floor the raja with a
grim coldsmile turned and strode
away

  the days passed the raja not de-
terred by neranyas curses often
heaped upon him spent even more
time than formerly in the great hall
and slept there oftener at night and
finally neranya wearied of cursing
and defying him and fell into a sul-
len silence the man was a study for
me and i observed every change in


weird tales

ms fleeting moods generally his con-
dition was that of miserable despair
which he attempted bravely to con-
ceal even the boon of suicide had
been denied him for when he would
wriggle into an erect position the rail
of his pen was a foot above his head
so that he could not clamber over and
break his skull on the stone floor be-
neath and when he had tried to
starve himself the attendants forced
food down his throat so that he
abandoned such attempts at times
his eyes would blaze and his breath
would come in gasps for imaginary
vengeance was working within him
but steadily he became quieter and
more tractable and was pleasant and
responsive when i would converse
with him whatever might have been
the tortures which the raja had de-
cided on none as yet had been or-
dered and although neranya knew
that they were in contemplation he
never referred to them or complained
of his lot

  the awful climax of this situation
was reached one night and even after
this lapse of years i can not approach
its description without a shudder

it was a hot night and the raja had
gone to sleep in the great hall
lying on a high cot placed on the main
floor just underneath the edge of the
balcony i had been unable to sleep
in my own apartment and so i had
stolen into the great hall through the
heavily curtained entrance at the end
farthest from the balcony as i en-
tered i heard a peculiar soft sound
above the patter of the fountain ne-
ranyas cage was partly concealed
from my view by the spraying water
but i suspected that the unusual sound
came from him stealing a little to
one side and crouching against the
dark hangings of the wall i could
see him in the faint light which dimly
illuminated the hall and then i dis-
covered that my surmise was correct
-neranya was quietly at work cu-
rious to learn more and knowing that

only mischief could have been inspir-
ing him  sank into a thiek robe on
the floor and watched him

  to my great astonishment neranya
was tearing off with his teeth the bag
which served as his outer garment
he did it cautiously casting sharp
glances frequently at the raja who
sleeping soundly on his cot below
breathed heavily after starting a
strip with his teeth neranya by the
same means would attach it to the
railing of his cage and then wriggle
away much after the manner of a cat-
erpillars crawling and this would
cause the strip to be torn out the full
length of his garment he repeated
this operation with incredible patience
and skill until his entire garment had
been torn into strips two or three
of these he tied end to end with his
teeth lips and tongue tightening the
knots by placing one end of the strip
under his body and drawing the other
taut with his teeth in this way he
made a line several feet long one end
of which he made fast to the rail with
his mouth it then began to dawn
upon me that he was going to make
an insane attempt - impossible of
achievement without hands feet
arms or legs-to escape from his
cage for what purpose the raja
was asleep in the hall-ah i caught
my breath oh the desperate insane
thirst for revenge which could have
unhinged so clear and firm a mind
even though he should accomplish the
impossible feat of climbing over the
railing of his cage that he might fall
to the floor below for how could he
slide down the rope he would be
in all probability killed or stunned
and even if he should escape these
dangers it would be impossible for
him to clamber upon the cot without
rousing the raja and impossible even
though the raja were dead amazed
at the mans daring and convinced
that his sufferings and brooding had
destroyed his reason nevertheless i
watched him with breathless interest

  with other strips tied together he
his unconquerable enemy



made a short swing across one side of
his cage he caught the long line in
his teeth at a point not far from the
rail then wriggling with great effort
to an upright position his back braced
against the rail he put his chin over
the swing and worked toward one
end he tightened the grasp of his
chin on the swing and with tremen-
dous exertion working the lower end
of his spine against the railing he
began gradually to ascend the side of
his cage the labor was so great that
he was compelled to pause at inter-
vals and his breathing was hard and
painful and even while thus resting
he was in a position of terrible strain
and his pushing against the swing
caused it to press hard against his
windpipe and nearly strangle him

	after amazing effort he had elevat-
ed the lower end of his body until it
protruded above the railing the top
of which was now across the lower
end of his abdomen gradually he
worked his body over going back-
ward until there was sufficient excess
of weight on the outer side of the rail
and then with a quick lurch he raised
his head and shoulders and swung
into a horizontal position on top of
the rail of course he would have
fallen to the floor below had it not
been for the line which he held in his
teeth with so great nicety had he
estimated the distance between his
mouth and the point where the rope
was fastened to the rail that the line
tightened and checked him just as he
reached the horizontal position on the
rail if one had told me beforehand
that such a feat as i had just seen
this man accomplish was possible i
should have thought him a fool

  neranya was now balanced on his
stomach across the top of the rail and
he eased his position by bending his
spine and hanging down on either side
as much as possible having rested
thus for some minutes he began cau-
tiously to slide off backward slowly
paying out the line through his teeth

finding almost a fatal difficulty in
passing the knots now it is quite
possible that the line would have
escaped altogether from his teeth lat-
erally when he would slightly relax
his hold to let it slip had it not been
for a very ingenious plan to which he
had resorted this consisted in his
having made a turn of the line around
his neck before he attacked the swing
thus securing a threefold control of
the line-one by his teeth another by
friction against his neck and a third
by his ability to compress it between
his cheek and shoulder it was quite
evident now that the minutest details
of a most elaborate plan had been
carefully worked out by him before
beginning the task and that possibly
weeks of difficult theoretical study
had been consumed in the mental
preparation as i observed him i was
reminded of certain hitherto unac-
countable things which he had been
doing for some weeks past-going
through certain hitherto inexplicable
motions undoubtedly for the purpose
of training his muscles for the im-
measurably arduous labor which he
was now performing

  a stupendous and seemingly impos-
sible part of his task had been ac-
complished could he reach the floor
in safety gradually he worked him-
self backward over the rail in im-
minent danger of falling but his
nerve never wavered and i could see
a wonderful light in his eyes with
something of a lurch his body fell
against the outer side of the railing
to which he was hanging by his chin
the line still held firmly in his teeth
slowly he slipped his chin from the
rail and then hung suspended by the
line in his teeth by almost imper-
ceptible degrees with infinite caution
he descended the line and finally
his unwieldy body rolled upon the
floor safe and unhurt

  what miracle would this superhu-
man monster next accomplish i was
quick and strong and was ready and


weird tales

able to intercept any dangerous act
but not until danger appeared would
i interfere with this extraordinary
scene

  i must confess to astonishment upon
having observed that neranya instead
of proceeding directly toward the
sleeping raja took quite another di-
rection then it was only escape
after all that the wretch contem-
plated and not the murder of the
raja but how could he escape the
only possible way to reach the outer
air without great risk was by ascend-
ing the stairs to the balcony and leav-
ing by the corridor which opened
upon it and thus fall into the hands
of some british soldiers quartered
thereabout who might conceive the
idea of hiding him but surely it was
impossible for neranya to ascend that
long flight of stairs neveitheless he
made directly for them his method of
progression this he lay upon his
back with the lower end of his body
toward the stairs then bowed his
spine upward thus drawing his
head and shoulders a little forward
straightened and then pushed the
lower end of his body forward a space
equal to that through which he had
drawn his head repeating this again
and again each time while bending
his spine preventing his head from
slipping by pressing it against the
floor his progress was laborious and
slow but sensible and finally he ar-
rived at the foot of the stairs

  it was manifest that his insane pur-
pose was to ascend them the desire
for freedom must have been strong
within him wriggling to an upright
position against the newel-post he
looked iip at the great height which
he had to climb and sighed but there
was no dimming of the light in his
eyes how could lie accomplish the
impossible task

  his solution of the problem was
very simple though daring and per-
ilous as all the rest while leaning
against the newel-post he let himself

fall diagonally upon the bottom step
where he lay partly hanging over but
safe on his side turning upon his
back he wriggled forward along the
step to the rail and raised himself to
an upright position against it as he
had against the newel-post fell as be-
fore and landed on the second step
in this manner with inconceivable
labor he accomplished the ascent of
the entire flight of stairs

  it being apparent to me that the
raja was not the object of neranyas
movements the anxiety which i had
felt on that account was now entirely
dissipated the things which already
he had accomplished were entirely be-
yond the nimblest imagination the
sympathy which i had always felt for
the wretched man was now greatly
quickened and as infinitesimally small
as i knew his chances for escape to
be i nevertheless hoped that he would
succeed any assistance from me
however was out of the question and
it never should be known that i had
witnessed the escape

  neranya was now upon the balcony
and i could dimly see him wriggling
along toward the door which led out
upon the balcony finally he stopped
and wriggled to an upright position
against the rail which had wide open-
ings between the balusters his back
was toward me but he slowly turned
and faced me and the hall at that
great distance i could not distinguish
his features but the slowness with
which he had worked even before he
had fully accomplished the ascent of
the stairs was evidence all too eloquent
of his extreme exhaustion nothing
but a most desperate resolution could
have sustained him thus far but he
had drawn upon the last remnant of
his strength he looked around the
hall with a sweeping glance and then
down upon the raja who was sleeping
immediately beneath him over twenty
feet below he looked long and ear-
nestly sinking lower and lower and

                        continued from page 

quite naturally how do i know
how do you expect me to remember
what i said that evening any more
than any other evening my words
were of no importance except to the
two who thought i was going to mur-
der them what stupidity perhaps
they had something to do with the
next days work i couldnt say  
but the judge insisted tiow was
it that you and your wife werent as-
tonished when only two people came
down the next morning why were
you silent about that we would
never have known a thing about all
this if monsieur and madame chau-
lieu had not come themselves to tell
us that they fled in the night

   why should i be astonished
scheffer answered you know the
little show we gave and still continue
to give for amateurs it had fright-
ened the little lady and she can tell
you herself that several times during
the evening she said the whole
place frightens me no i was not
surprized and i must admit that we
had a good laugh over it when the two
italians told us the next morning be-
fore leaving that monsieur and ma-
dame had been frightened to death
and had escaped by the attic win-
dow    besides we found the rope
there  as for the italians after
the abrupt departure of monsieur and
madame they had carried their bed-
ding into the other room and had
passed an excellent night there

   still if the incident was as
funny as that you had no reason to
keep still about it 

     but who told you i did  on the
contrary ive told it scores of times
to travelers stopping for a drink   

but to find them now-

   you might have said something
to the stage-driver 

   oh when he stops at the inn he
has other things to do he is busy

with his horses besides he may have
heard my tale at that

   no he has never heard it   
he never suspected a thing

   that is quite possible what
should he suspect   that story is a
trivial matter you surprize me with
all this fuss

   the italians didnt tell you that
they frightened monsieur and ma-
dame in order to obtain possession of
the room  

   good heavens no

  the answer was a serious one be-
cause after all if the whole thing had
only been a joke it was strange that
the italians had not boasted of it be-
fore their departure

  iam the only victim in the whole
affair scheffer went on because i
have not been paid for the bill yet
and that is probably why the italians
did not confess that they were respon-
sible for the flight of the other two
they did not want to be asked to pay
for the bill

 as you see he had an answer
ready for everything

  nevertheless the judge was per-
plexed and the inquest continued for
some time they made new searches
but they found nothing and the mat-
ter was finally dropped it was not
until three years later a year after
maria-luces death that the affair
came to light again and this time the
papers were full of wild tales

  antonio ferretti and olivia or-
sino had never been heard of again
and you must admit that it was
strange i know that antonio fer-
retti was married and that he may
have gone to some far corner of the
earth to enjoy his happiness under an
assumed name but after all he was
just becoming famous and to give up
such a splendid career forever   
i grew more and more convinced that
they had been murdered and even to-
weird tales



day after a apse of over twenty years
i am positive of the fact

  but i was saying that three years
later something new occurred in ex-
cavating not far from the inn some
new bones were found and you can
well pieture the stir that it caused
the weisbachs were on everyones
tongue again and the scheffers had
become famous overnight as famous
as the weisbachs had been the ex-
perts however did not agree on the
age of the bones

  in the meantime first one then
two and then three families who had
had disappearances among their rela-
tions claimed that they might quite
possibly have been victims of the
scheffers because they had taken a
trip through french switzerland
they went even so far as to establish
the fact that a young man from linz
who had abducted a girl of good fam-
ily had slept one night at the inn of
blood at that the scheffers and
their servants were arrested and i
was called as one of the witnesses

  their guilt seemed established and
there was no doubt that they would be
sentenced when we suddenly learned
that the young man in question had
married the young girl of good family
in america and that they were farm-
ers in minnesota the scheffers were
acquitted    and now my story is
done

  and nothing more was ever heard
of the italians dorat demanded

  never

  and the scheffers are still going
strong captain michel asked and
this time he was not joking

  yes they are still there making
money i heard of them quite recently
from a friend who passed through
soleure the  inn of blood  has become

weird tales

the shadow kingdom

con tinued from page 

and came at last to the council cham-
ber the door was closed as usual
and the councilors arranged them-
selves in the order of their rank before
the dais upon which stood the king
like a bronze statue brule took up
his stand behind kull

  kull swept the room with a swift
st are surely no chance of treachery
here seventeen councilors there
were all known to him all of them
had espoused his cause when he
ascended the throne

 men of valusia- he began in

the conventional manner then halted
perplexed the councilors had risen
as a man and were moving toward
him there was no hostility in their
looks but their actions were strange
for a council room the foremost was
close to him when brule sprang for-
ward crouched like a leopard

   ka nama kaa lajerama his voice
crackled through the sinister silence
of the room and the foremost coun-
cilor recoiled hand flashing to his
robes and like a spring released
brule moved and the man pitched
headlong to the glint of his sword-
headlong he pitched and lay still
while his face faded and became the
head of a mighty snake

  slay kull rasped the piets
voice   they be all serpent men  

  the rest was a scarlet maze kull
saw the familiar faces dim like fading
fog and in their places gaped horrid
reptilian visages as the whole band
rushed forward his mind was dazed
but his giant body faltered not

  the singing of his sword filled the
room and the onrushing flood broke
in a red wave but they surged for-
ward again seemingly willing to fling
their lives away in order to drag down
the king hideous jaws gaped at
him terrible eyes blazed into his un-
blinkingly a frightful fetid scent

pervaded the atmosphere-the serpent
scent that kull had known in south-
ern jungles swords and daggers
leaped at him and he was dimly aware
that they wounded him but kull was
in his element never before had he
faced such grim foes but it mattered
little they lived their veins held
blood that could be spilt and they
died when his great sword cleft their
skulls or drove through their bodies
slash thrust thrust and swing yet
had kull died there but for the man
who crouched at his side parrying
and thrusting for the king was clear
berserk fighting in the terrible atlan-
tean way that seeks death to deal
death he made no effort to avoid
thrusts and slashes standing straight
up and ever plunging forward no
thought in his frenzied mind but to
slay not often did kull forget his
fighting craft in his primitive fury
but now some chain had broken in his
soul flooding his mind with a red
wave of slaughter- ust he slew a
foe at each blow but they surged
about him and time and again brule
turned a thrust that would have
slain as he crouched beside kull par-
rying and warding with cold skill
slaying not as kull slew with long
slashes and plunges but with short
overhand blows and upward thrusts

  kull laughed a laugh of insanity
the frightful faces swirled about him
in a scarlet blaze he felt steel sink
into his arm and dropped his sword
in a flashing arc that cleft his foe to
the breast-bone then the mists faded
and the king saw that he and brule
stood alone above a sprawl of hideous
crimson figures who lay still upon
the floor

 valka what a killing said
brule shaking the blood from his
eyes   kull had these been warriors
who knew how to use the steel we had
weird tales



died here these serpent priests know
naught of swordcraft and die easier
than any men i ever slew yet had
there been a few more i think the
matter had ended otherwise

  kull nodded the wild berserker
blaze had passed leaving a mazed
feeling of great weariness blood
seeped from wounds on breast shoul-
der arm and leg brule himself
bleeding from a score of flesh wounds
glanced at him in some concern

  lord kull jet us hasten to have
your wounds dressed by the women  
kull thrust him aside with a drunk-
en sweep of his mighty arm

  nay well see this through ere we
cease go you though and have your
wounds seen to-i command it

  the piet laughed grimly your
wounds are more than mine lord

king- he began then stopped as

a sudden thought struck mm by
valka kull tliis is not the council
room  

  kull looked about and suddenly i
other fogs seemed to fade nay
this is the room where eallal died a
thousand years ago-since unused and
named accursed

  then by the gods they tricked us
after all exclaimed brule in a fury
kicking the corpses at their feet
they caused us to walk like fools
into their ambush by their magic
they changed the appearance of
all-

  then there is further deviltry
afoot said kull for if there be
true men in the councils of valusia
they should be in the real council
room now come swiftly

 and leaving the room with its
ghastly keepers they hastened through
halls that seemed deserted until they
came to the real council room then
kull halted with a ghastly shudder
from the council room sounded a
voice speaking and the voice was his

xith a hand that shook he parted

v	 the tapestries and gazed into the
room there sat the councilors coun-

weird tales

terparts of the men he and brule had
just slain and upon the dais stood
kull king of valusia

  he stepped back his mind reeling

  this is insanity he whispered
am i kull do i stand here or is
that kull yonder in very truth and
am i but a shadow a figment of
thought

  brules hand clutching his shoul-
der shaking him fiercely brought him
to his senses

  valkas name be not a fool can
you yet be astounded after all we
have seen  see you not that those are
true men bewitched by a snake-man
who has taken your form as those
others took their forms by now you
should have been slain and yon mon-
ster reigning in your stead unknown
by those who bowed to you leap and
slay swiftly or else we are undone
the red slayers true men stand
close on each hand and none but you
can reach and slay him be swift

  kull shook off the onrushing dizzi-
ness flung back his head in the old
defiant gesture he took a long deep
breath as does a strong swimmer be-
fore diving into the sea then sweep-
ing back the tapestries made the dais
in a single lionlike bound brule had
spoken truly there stood men of the
red slayers guardsmen trained to
move quick as the striking leopard
any but kull had died ere he could
reach the usurper but the sight of
kull identical with the man upon the
dais held them in their tracks their
minds stunned for an instant and
that was long enough he upon the
dais snatched for his sword but even
as his fingers closed upon the hilt
kulls sword stood out behind his
shoulders and the thing that men had
thought the king pitched forward
from the dais to lie silent upon the
floor

  hold kulls lifted hand and
kingly voice stopped the rush that had
started and while they stood astound-
ed he pointed to the thing which lay

before them-whose face was fading
into that of a snake they recoiled
and from one door came brule and
from another came ka-nu

  these grasped the kings bloody
hand find ka-nu spoke men of va-
lusia you have seen with your own
eyes this is the true kull the might-
iest king to whom valusia has ever
bowed the power of the serpent is
broken and ye be all true men king
kull have you commands

  lift that carrion said kull and
men of the guard took up the thing

  now follow me said the king
and he made his way to the accursed
room brule with a look of concern
offered the support of his arm but
kull shook him off

  the distance seemed endless to the
bleeding king but at last he stood at
the door and laughed fiercely and
grimly when he heard the horrified
ejaculations of the councilors

  at his orders the guardsmen filing
the corpse they carried beside the
others and motioning all from the
room kull stepped out last and closed
the door

  a wave of dizziness left him shaken
the faces turned to him pallid and
wonderingly swirled and mingled in
a ghostly fog he felt the blood from
his wound trickling down his limbs
and he knew that what he was to do
he must do quickly or not at all

  his sword rasped from its sheath

  brule are you there

  aye brules face looked at him
through the mist close to his shoul-
der but brules voice sounded leagues
and eons away

  remember our vow brule and
now bid them stand back  

  his left arm cleared a space as he
flung up his sword then with all his
waning power he drove it through the
door into the jamb driving the great
sword to the hilt and sealing the room
forever

  legs braced wide he swayed drunk-
weird tales



enly facing the horrified councilors
let this room be doubly accursed
and let those rotting skeletons lie
there forever as a sign of the dying
might of the serpent here i swear
that i shall hunt the serpent-men
from land to land from sea to sea
giving no rest until all be slain that
good triumph and the power of hell
be broken this thing i swear-i-
kull-king-of-valusia  

  his knees buckled as the faces
swayed and swirled the councilors
leaped forward but ere they could
reach him kull slumped to the floor
and lay still face upward

  the councilors surged about the
fallen king chattering and shrieking
ka-nu beat them back with his
clenched fists cursing savagely

  back you fools would you stifle
the little life that is yet in him
how brule is he dead or will he
live -to the warrior who bent above
the prostrate kull

  dead sneered brule irritably 
such a man as this is not so easily
killed lack of sleep and loss of
blood have weakened him-by valka
he has a score of deep wounds but
none of them mortal yet have those
gibbering fools bring the court women
here at once

  brules eyes lighted with a fierce
proud light

  valka ka-nu but here is such a
man as i knew not existed in these de-
generate days he will be in the sad-
dle in a few scant days and then may
the serpent-men of the world beware
of kull of valusia valka but that
will be a rare hunt ah i see long
years of prosperity for the world with
such a king upon the throne of valu-
