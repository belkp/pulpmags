my life with
sitting bull

by walter j winters

this is the most amazing true life ad-
venture story that has ever appeared
in the pages of a magazine walter j
winters once rode naked into battle
with sitting bulls paint-daubed sioux
legions here are his adventures as told
a few years ago to william robertson

was bom in toronto on march 


at the age of thirteen i was a husky
lad tall big-boned and looked seventeen

  i always had a craving to get out into
the world and make my own fortune in
fact i was forever pestering my mother
to let me go but she steadfastly refused

  finally however i persuaded her to
allow me to have my own way and she
relented

  having parted with the family i set
out for winnipeg and upon reaching that
city i put up at a mrs mcmurties board-
ing house it was there that i first made
the acquaintance of charles dad fow-
ler an old indian fighter and buffalo
hunter from the united states

  a great friendship sprang up between
us he told me he was going to make a
trip to the south american gold fields and
invited me to go with him and as there
was every prospect of exciting adventure
in such a journey i eagerly accepted

  it was his idea to build a boat and float
down the mississippi to new orleans
hunting and trapping on the way to get
enough furs to pay for the last lap of the
journey to venezuela

  having made our preparations we set
out for the headwaters of the missouri
whence we expected to drift into the big
river


	indian

  the boat was built according to dads
plan and we started down the stream
launched on an adventure that has no par-
allel in history

  in due time we reached a point midway
between great falls and benton where we
stopped to trap beaver in a little creek

  we remained there ajweek then em-
barked and paddled downstream

  i was gazing lazily into the water when
i felt the boat slacken speed as my partner
dragged his paddle

  s-s-s-st he hissed and i glanced up

  to our left across the river the whole
valley was alive with indians and ponies
while hundreds of teepees dotted the land

  a few yards from shore a half dozen
bull-boats each containing two or three
braves danced and spun on the water like
great hairy spiders

  a shout from shore the redskins in
the bull-boats saw us and with a mastery
of the strange tub-like crafts made of
bent staves over which buffalo skins had
been stretched they started in our di-
rection with remarkable speed when one
considers the awkwardness of the devices
they were piloting

    by god dad cried and it was sel-
dom he used that oath it was just what i
was afeared of them devils is sioux

  well if were in for it were in for
it i answered theres no need to try
to run away from them

  and then i turned and glanced at the
old man his face was like chalk but
otherwise he appeared quite calm

  i aint worryin on my part much he
said but it is fer you walter dont
under any circumstances let em know
that i understand and speak the language
im a marked man with a couple of their
bands

  if they recognize me theyre likely as
not to do the same dirty work with you
theyve got saved up for me

  instinctively i grabbed my rifle and
cocked it

  dont shoot for the love of god the
old man cautioned in a hoarse whisper

  i wont i answered with a hysterical
laugh paddle on we might just as well
go over and try to make friends with
them

  at that very moment fortune favored
me with an opportunity to let off steam

stories

ii

tonk honk came the call of a
wild goose as it glided over the
trees and started to dip toward the river

  scarcely realizing what i was doing i
pulled my gun and fired

  the bullet went true to its mark and
the big bird splashed in the water not a
hundred feet from the nearest bu -boat a
second later two more geese arose from
the river bank and headed toward the
teepee-dotted valley on the other side

  bang again i fired but missed an-
other goose winged lazily by for the birds
were unbelievably tame and again i
winged one which fluttered down on the
opposite bank in the very midst of a
group of redskins who had been attracted
by the shots

  tall shootin son the old man mut-
tered i dont know how you did it but
if id had my way about it them bullets
all three would have plugged some of
them dirty sioux

  the bull-boats which were being aug-
mented by others from the shore began to
take on a fan shape we saw at once that
the plan was to encircle us but we paid
no heed to it instead i put my rifle back
in the boat and went to work with my oar
in a few more strokes we had come within
reach of the first goose i had winged and
dragged it into the boat

   well give it to the chief fowler mur-
mured under his breath and a moment
more he turned to one of the indians
whose bull-boat by this time had come al-
most alongside us and exclaimed how
how but try as he would there was not
a friendly inflection in his voice

  the indian was one of the handsomest
specimens i had ever seen he must have
been six feet two tall and his muscles
stood out on his broad chest and arms like
a mass of glittering brown cables

  he wore a headdress of vari-colored
feathers and his face was streaked with
yellow and blue

  the aborigine grunted some kind of a
reply threw up his hand in a token of
friendship and pointed toward the bank
indicating that we should proceed in that
direction

  by this time a number of other boat-
men had closed in on our rear and we
my life with sitting bull



were herded toward the shore which was
now lined with several hundred indians
men women and children all of whom
were evidently watching the proceedings
with the liveliest interest

   when at last the prow of our little craft
grated on the gravelly bottom three or
four youthful indians dashed into the
water seized the sides of the boat and
dragged it on shore

  my knowledge of indians was very lim-
ited-much more so than it would other-
wise have been had not my experienced
companion been a man of so few words
all that i did know about them however
i had gathered from him

  it required considerable courage for me
to step out of the boat with a show of
indifference

  but i knew it would be a frightful mis-
take to do otherwise and seizing the goose
i had salvaged from the water i sprang
ashore as if i were greeting old-time
friends

  old dad was only a step behind and
he whispered

  give the bird to the chief

  the cautioning was unnecessary how-
ever as i had no other thought in mind

  braves and squaws crowded about us
staring laughing grimacing as though we
were two strange creatures that had
dropped down from another planet

  a dozen or more dogs of divers lineage
darted forward and began sniffing around
our boots winding up with a grand free-
for-all fight

   while the dog -fight was being settled a
masterly figure brushed aside the staring
savages and stood gazing at us with eyes
that seemed to bore into my very being
like a pair of rapidly revolving gimlets

  the upper portion of the indians face
was painted black the lower part was
brilliant with madder which glistened in
the last ravs of the dying sun

  the man was about six feet in height
straight as the proverbial ramrod and
rather inclined to heaviness his jet hair
hung platted on either side of his face and
around his shoulders was flung a somewhat
faded blanket of carmine and green

  his legs were inclined to be stocky
and were obviously bowed the only short-
coming in his really splendid appearance

  there was nothing in the mans costume

to suggest to one of my experience that
this was the chief but those flashing elo-
quent eyes which burned like coals in their
lurid setting spoke a language all must
understand 

  i command and my word is law
flinching under the iron gaze of the
chief and scarecely knowing what i was
doing i bowed and handed him the goose

  how ludicrous it must have seemed
but there was never a trace of humor
on those irresistible features as his huge
hand accepted my poor gift and passed it
to a youth of perhaps fifteen who stood
beside him

  then he spoke in sioux i noticed
fowler shake his head falsely indicating
that he did not understand and i imitated
his gesture

  then the chief laid his hand on my
shoulder and i felt instinctively that his
attitude was one of friendship

  i see you shoot wamble ishta eagle-
eye he said in broken english come
with me

  and uttering a cryptic command to his
braves who rapidly fell back and opened
up a path through the crowd that huddled
about us he led the way to the village

  fowler and i both carried our rifles
with the muzzles pointed to the ground
and i was somewhat astonished that we
were not disarmed

  the chief paid no attention to our
weapons but walked ahead with a panther-
like tread that betokened his physical
strength and agility it would have been
an act of madness on our part however
to have attempted resistance

  a hundred or more braves trailed in the
rear and the mere shift of the position of
our rifles would have been the signal for
a volley from behind

at last we arrived at a larger teepee
that stood out some little distance
from the others a couple of squaws were
cooking meat in a huge kettle not far from
the flap of a wigwam

  they looked up for only a moment
when we passed grunted chattered a few
words in sioux and resumed their task
just as if nothing unusual had happened

  the chief pointed to the entrance of
the teepee and we stepped in the floor
was covered with hides of various kinds


indian stories

buffalo deer and elk

  a few blankets hung from the tent
poles and the only other decorations were
a huge cherry-wood pipe fluttering with
feathers somewhat similar to those now
common in curio stores but of beadwork
and two or three bows and well-fitted
quivers

 fowler and i stood our weapons
against the tent wall and seated ourselves
on a panther skin

  the chief had not uttered a word since
we had left the river bank

  settin bull old dad murmured as
our captor turned his back to drop the flap
of the teepee

  a thrill shot through me at last i
was in the presence of the hero of whom
i had heard only a few nights before as i
lay under the starry sky drinking in fow-
lers homely description of the siouxs
gallant exploits

  the indian turned his sharp ear had
overheard the whisper of my companion
there was a trace of a smile upon his im-
mobile countenance

  you know me he said in english
have i seen you before

  there was not a flicker in the blue eyes
of the old man as he replied truthfully to
the contrary but i knew his heart must be
beating faster for fear sitting bull might
penetrate the secret of his former expe-
rience with the sioux

  if i have never seen you how you
know me the chief queried

  i guessed was fowlers reply

  the qiief shook his head as a sign that
he either did not understand or believe
him

  i do not know the sioux fowler went
on swimming out of the deep water into
which he seemed to have slipped but i
have heard much of them my father for
many years lived in wyoming often-
times he told me of his friend jumping
buffalo

  at the mention of his fathers name
sitting bull betokened surprise but he said
nothing

  jumping buffalo was a brave man a
very brave man dad went on drop-
ping in the stress of a light situation his
usual careless mode of speech my father
told me this many times he told me how
jumping buffalo died fighting hand to

hand with a crow warrior but killing his
enemy with his knife as he dropped from
his saddle

  so many times i heard that story so
many times i heard him say jurnping
buffalo has a brave son hunkeshnee
meaning slowpoke a nickname given
sitting bull during his boyhood because
he was not a good runner and was almost
always on horseback who will some time
be a great chief of the unkpappas

  hunkeshnee is now settin bull i
know and settin bull looks like the
jumping buffalo my father knew

  from some source fowler had learned
about sitting bulls early life and of his
father jumping buffalo but of course
it had not come from the source he pre-
tended

  the white man lies sitting bull said
with that sarcastic curl of the lip for which
he was noted but he tells a kind lie this
time

  the white man is born with a lie on
his lips he dies with a lie on his lips
he goes to hell with a lie on his lips
then he wonders why the indian cannot
trust him

  the chiefs words bit like acid they
came from a heart embittered by years of
dealing with unprincipled whites the riff-
raff of the plains who were indeed not
samples of our race at all but whom sit-
ting bull took as representative of the
caucasians generally

  the situation was not a comfortable one
for us sitting bull sat silent for a few
minutes and i could not help wondering
how he had detected the falsehood iti
old dads words

ill

later i was to learn that those gim-
let-like eyes had the peculiar faculty
of boring their way into the very soul of
those he conversed with and reading the
innermost thoughts of the speaker as
though they stood out in bas-relief on his
forehead

  experience had been a splendid teacher
with him he had seen liars so often that
they were visible to him at a great
distance

  there was a slight scratching at the wig-
wam flap a guttural exclamation came
my life with sitting bull



from the chief

  in stepped three fine specimens of the
indian race favorite warriors of sitting
bull

  the newcomers seated themselves oppo-
site us on the right of the chief eyeing
us keenly as sitting bull proceeded to ply
us with questions as to who we were
whence we came and what we were doing
on the upper missouri

  dad who did the talking for us ex-
plained as best he could that we had come
in search of furs and with a view to pro-
ceeding on down the river to the father of
waters and thence to a great city where
the mississippi tumbled into the warm
waters of the gulf

  when the old man had finished his re-
cital the chief produced a pipe and kinn-
kinick mullen and other leaves which
passed for tobacco

  as a gesture from him one of his fa-
vorites disappeared from the wigwam
returning a moment later with a smoking
fagot from which the pipe was lighted

  he then held the ember out signing for
us to smoke if we chose

  fowler shook his head but i gladly ac-
cepted an opportunity to do something
to hide my nervousness and produced a
little stone pipe which had been presented
to me by an aged indian in toronto

  i had scarcely lighted it and taken a
few drags from the wooden stem when i
noticed a curious look on sitting bulls
face

  he fired a couple of trivial questions
at me apparently paying no heed to my
answers but his gimlet eyes were drilling
their way through me

  i could not understand his strange ex-
pression until he motioned for me to let
him see my pipe

  he took one look at the crude stone
bowl and his painted face clouded until
it seemed to my imaginative mind the
crimson portion of his visage had turned
black too

  holding it so his favorites could see it
closely he fixed those piercing orbs upon
me again and muttered

  ojibway chippewa pipe you come
from ojibway country

  and his hand shot out like a lance to-
ward the east

  fowler hastened to tell how the gift had

come into my possession

  the explanation seemed to satisfy sit-
ting bull for a moiiuent but so fierce was
his hatred for the chippewas ancient ene-
mies of the dacotahs that he could not
return the pipe to me

  instead he seized a hatchet which lay
beside the favorite nearest him and bring-
ing it down with a terrific blow broke the
stone bowl into bits

  the goose flesh quivered along my
spine and i believe my hair stood up like
a porcupines quills as i witnessed the in-
tense fury of sitting bull

  the muscles stood out like whipcords
on his neck and fire blazed from those
deep brown eyes as he poured forth in-
vectives against the chippewas

  his harangue lasted perhaps two min-
utes then apparently relieved he held
his head to one side in a whimsical way
and the ghost of a smile strayed over his
painted features

  reaching for a crude box that lay near
him he fumbled inside and drew forth a
pipe carved on the front was a bull buf-
falo sitting on his haunches-a sitting
bull-which he extended to me

  wamble ishta he said smoke the
pipe of a man not a dog

  i could have thrown my youthful arms
about the old savage so great was my re-
lief at the cooling of his anger

  thereafter the chiefs attitude changed
completely

  he was as jovial as one of his stolid
nature could be and seemed bent on enter-
taining us as well as possible

  the flap of the lodge was thrown back
and the light from the camp-fire flared into
the teepee while squaws brought in earth-
enware bowls filled with a stew of venison
and stringy bear meat

  fowler and i were ravenous and ate
greedily using our pocket knives in the
absence of cutlery

  not yet had i at least become accus-
tomed to the primitive art of handling our
viands with our fingers as our savage host
did

  the meal finished fowler arose and
hanked sitting bull for his hospitality

  we must go now he said it is
growing late we will have to pitch camp
before dark

  a smile spread over the painted features
	indian

of the chieftain

  no he said you must not go yet
and again a half dozen sentences
crackled from his lips like machine-gun
fire and one of the favorites departed re-
turning a few moments later with a bulky
bundle of furs and some beaded moc-
casins

  the white men have furs he said
but the sioux have had much luck too
we will give them plenty of furs and our
squaws have made fine moccasins

  he sorted the furs and moccasins in
two heaps

  these he said pointing to one of the
heaps and with a touch of humor are
for you old-man-with-the-jumping-buf-
falo-lie-on-his-lips

  then turning to me he said

  wamble ishta take them last night
i was sick at heart from traders who
came up the missouri last summer i se-
cured many rifles

  my warriors they shoot much but
have been trained to use the bow and ar-
row the white mans weapon is new to
them the bullets do not always go where
they want them to go so last night i go
to make medicine and ask the great spirit
to help my men use the white mans
weapon

  today you come i see you shoot the
wild goose on the wing never did i see
the white mans rifle used so well the
great spirit has heard my call you have
oome to show my warriors how to use the
gun the great spirit send you

  fowlers face blanched

  sitting bull was determined we should
stay with them and become squaw men it
would be only a question of time fowler
feared until his past would be revealed
and the vengeance of the aborigine would
be meted out upon him

  he protested that we must go the
great city at the mouth of the mississippi
called for us in a few days we would be
far down the river away from the red
mans territory

  sitting bull however was persistent
although his attitude was one of gentle-
ness and firmness combined he did ncrt
desire us to stay unwillingly but if we
would become fixtures among his band he
would give us ponies

  we would be favorites among the

stories

unkpappas and share in the sale of furs
equally with the bravest and most promi-
nent of his warriors

  i had weakened and was ready to join
up with the outfit but fowler was deter-
mined to talk himself out of a bad situ-
ation if possible and he orated at great
length

  sitting bulls reply was to bring into
the wigwam two squaws-one a beautiful
girl of about sixteen her hair decorated
with two red feathers and her sylph-like
body clad in buckskin handsomely en-
broidered with beads which betokened that
she was not the daughter of a common
indian

  the other woman was perhaps forty
short and fat but not without a certain
amount of savage beauty

  the squaws stood eying us with indif-
ference although they evidently under-
stood why they had been summoned for
they showed no surprise when sitting bull
finally presented them to us as our wives
if we chose to become unkpappas

  wamble ishta the chief continued
do you wish schck-oka little robin
for your squaw

  the young girls face lighted with a ra-
diant smile and she stepped forward and
accepted my proffered hand

  i had made up my mind from that
moment i was to become a ward of sitting
bull the civilized world could wag on
as it would

  the thrills of the chase the freedom
of the primitive of which i had so long
dreamed would from that moment be
mine

  i passed my arm around the trim figure
of schck-oka and she looked up into my
eyes smiling murmuring the only english
word she knew the one she had heard
from sitting bull-eagle eyes

  sitting bull went through the same cere-
mony with fowler but i was wholly un-
mindful of it my thoughts were of
schck-oka and the strange change that
was to come into my life

iv

the days that followed my joining the
unkpappas were the most memorable
in my life

to say that i was overjoyed at the
my life with sitting bull



thought of becoming a squaw-man is to
put it mildly the romance of it all ap-
pealed irresistibly to my youthful mind
although old dad was not particularly
enamored with it

  in fact he protested to me often that
no good would come of it

  to be sure he had less reason to look
upon the situation enthusiastically

  he and his squaw had been comfortably
established in a lodge not far from sitting
bull but i to my amazement was made
a member of the chiefs own household

  the compliment however at the outset
was directed to little robin she was a
favorite of sitting bull

  at the suggestion of sitting bull i
adopted the native dress or rather lack
of dress for it consisted almost wholly of
a breech clout and moccasins with a cape-
like blanket which i used in chilly weather
when i was not engaged in vigorous physi-
cal exertion-

  my hair which was as long as a sheiks
when i left minneapolis reached below my
collar at the time of my capture and it
was not long until the stiff black mane by
dint of constant brushing and with the
aid of a deerskin thong which i tied around
my head hung down to my shoulders

  at first my white skin was a matter of
curiosity to the entire band but sun and
wind soon did their work i was as tanned
as a beach life-saver in mid-august and
there was little about my general appear-
ance to distinguish me from my copper-
colored comrades

  little robin took great delight in paint-
ing my face and her artistic endeavors
were a source of considerable amusement
to sitting bull but he got his best amuse-
ment out of dad fowler who reluctantly
appeared one day with his features
smeared with red and yellow paint and
minus his prize possession-the gray im-
perial beard which he had worn with such
dignity when i had first met him in win-
nipeg

  look at big eyes sitting bull re-
marked as he pointed to the old gentle-
mans large blue orbs which seemed
strangely out of place in a painted sioux

  and from that time on dad was known
in the camp as big eyes whose nickname
i had jestingly given him in the presence
of two half-breeds who spread it through

the entire village

  although sitting- bull had welcomed me
as someone sent by the great spirit to
teach his people the art of using the white
mans weaopns he was anything but lack-
ing in expertness with the rifle himself
his favorite weapon was a henry repeat-
ing rifle which he could use much better
than the average big game hunter of that
period i think everyone will agree with
me marksmanship was then at its best

  a morning or two after we had joined
the unkpappas the chief asked me to
take his son crowfoot but who was then
called little bull and test his marksman-
ship at a range i had established at the
edge of the camp

  fowler accompanied us and in his en-
thusiasm to make a good impression
plunged into a voluble dissertation on the
art of aiming a rifle which presently found
him speaking nothing but sioux in order
to make crowfoot understand

  while he was in the midst of his pa-
laver sitting bull joined us and stood
listening for some time before dad was
aware of his presence

  did jumping buffalos friend teach his
son to speak dacotah sioux too the
chief asked as dad turned about with
a hang-dog expression on his face

  fowler replied that he had learned the
language from his father

  a grunt from sitting bull and a shrug
of his shoulders was the only reply yet
it was enough to make me understand that
sitting bull suspected my old friend had
a very good reason for hiding the fact that
he understood the indian language when
we had first been brought into the chiefs
presence

  if he resented it however he never gave
any indication of the fact except that he
kept a pretty close eye on fowler for
some time

  we had been shooting at a target about
fifty yards away with my small rifle and i
had been able to uphold my reputation as
a crack shot though i had done nothing
so expert as kill the wild geese on the
wing

  i was shooting way over my head as
they say nowadays at the stirring moment
when the gimlet-eyes of sitting bull first
fixed themselves upon me and i have
never been able to do as well since that
	indian

time

  crowfoot was a good pupil he had
made some creditable scores and we were
planning to wind up our practice when
sitting bull asked for my rifle ran his
deep-brown eye an unusual type among
the sioux along the barrel and handed
a piece of birch bark about a foot and a
half square to his son motioned for the
boy to walk out toward the target

  when crowfoot had gone about fifty
yards his father called out in sioux for
him to hold up the bark a moment later
i was tremblingly awaiting while the chief
took aim

  the little rifle barked knocking the tar-
get from the young mans hand but he
quickly regained it and ran back to us
pointing gleefully to a hole not very far
from the center of the bark

  that is good practice to try crowfoots
nerve sitting bull observed

  but i wondered as we made our way
back to the wigwams whether it was more
trying on crowfoots nerves or upon his
fathers

v

about a week after we had joined
sitting bull the order was given to
break camp and start southward

  the order passed through the village
with the speed of the wind and in an in-
credibly short time the lodges were taken
down belongings were placked on ponies
and on the rude carts which some of them
drew and to the accompaniment of a per-
fect bedlam of barking from the numerous
dogs and the shouts of squaws and chil-
dren we were off on a hegira that eventu-
ally would lead us to the black hills for
the winter

  the trip was made by easy stages
many times we camped for a week or more
at points where trapping and hunting were
good

  during these stops i usually was out
on trapping expeditions for the greater
portion of the time sitting bull saw to
it that i was instructed in the art of using
the bow and arrow as well as instructed
in the use of the rifle

  crowfoot and i became good friends
and he often accompanied me when i ran
my trap lines he was a marvelous shot

stories

with the bow and could be depended upon
to provide us with all of the small game
we needed

  little robin also went with me and
no one i believe ever had a woman who
was a better companion or a more indus-
trious helpmeet

  she was an affectionate and kindly girl
and i never heard her utter a cross word
in all the time i was with her

  she delighted in cooking game and as-
sisting in skinning the leaver which crow-
foot and appearing elk a young brave
whom sitting bull usually assigned to go
with us on trapping expeditions brought
in

  during her spare time she busied herself
at beadwork and moccasin making at both
of which arts she was very adept

  she had been taught the use of bow
and arrow when she was very young and
although she was not nearly so skilful as
the men with these rude weapons and
cared very little for hunting on two occa-
sions when we returned to camp we found
she had killed a deer during our absence
skinned the animal and hung it up on a
sapling

  appearing elk was one of the best buf-
falo hunters of the younger unkpappas
and he was very eager for us to run across
a herd of bison that was the height of
my ambition and i shared his eagerness
for a chance at the great animals we
were not forced to wait long

  shortly after returning to camp with
our furs one morning we learned that a
herd of buffalo had been seen late that
day and a big hunt was in prospect the
next morning

  i was so excited i could hardly sleep
and was stirring about long before day-
light seeing that my bull rifle was in
good shape for the chase

  sitting bull was enthused by the pros-
pect but he did not choose to join in the
sport instead he directed appearing elk
man-afraid-of-his-horse a veteran hunt-
er and crowfoot to look after me and to
see that i got a chance at the game

  the first streaks of the dawn were
barely visible in the sky when the cry

  woo-ooh woo-ooh hay-ay wailed
through the village and ponies were
quickly corralled and braves painted as if
for battle leaped astride and were off for
my life with sitting bull



the big hunt

  i was one of the few hunters aside from
fowler who carried a rifle

  i chose a buckskin pony the best of
the lot the chief had given me as the steed
for that day and off i dashed in company
with my escort of three arriving in sight
of the buffalo after a ride of about three
miles

  the advance party had swung around
north of the herd and were driving them
southward at a rapid rate when i got my
first glimpse of the great wholly pack rac-
ing across the prairies at breakneck speed
the earth fairly shaking under their tread
and the noise of hoof beats rolling like
distant thunder

  woo-ooh hay-ay cried appearing
elk grasping his heavy buffalo bow which
was fully nine feet long and two inches
thick at the center and fitting a lance-
like arrow against the rawhide thong

  woo-ooh woo-ooh hay-ay echoed
man-afraid-of-his-horse and crowfoot
and lashing their ponies into a furious gal-
lop they were off with the speed of the
wind

  as we neared the herd on its left flank
my companions yelled to me to accompany
them and suddenly veered to their left
but i paid no heed to them

  dashing up to within range i let go
with my sharps rifle and had the pleasure
of seeing a fine bull go tumbling over

  but my triumph was short-lived the
buckskin pony already nervous because he
had apparently never been in contact with
a buffalo stampede before reared and
plunged like a demon at the crack of a
gun and it was all i could do to stop my-
self from being flung over his head

i did my utmost to calm the pony but
he had no sooner stopped his rearing
and plunging than he suddenly seemed to
go loco swinging abruptly southward he
dashed like a mad creature in the direction
taken by my companions

  in a moment i saw what their game
was a precipitous hill directly in line
with the buffalo a quarter of a mile south
made it certain that the herd leaders would
veer eastward

  two huge boulders showed up on the
landscape and behind these my indian

friends had chosen to take refuge and plug
the passing bison at will

  crowfoot and leaping dog flung them-
selves from their ponies and lay flat on
the ground while man-afraid-of-his-
horse took charge of their mounts and
retreated out of danger

  my pony had apparently about worn
himself out and was slackening speed
when the bison turned eastward i raised
my rifle and fired two shots in quick suc-
cession

  the devil broke out again in the pony
and he plunged like an eggshell in a tem-
pest finally throwing me to the ground
and stampeding wildly into the swirling
cloud of dust that now almost obscured
the frightened buffalo

  that was the last of the buckskin pony
for he was afterward knocked down and
trampled to death under the herd of bison
that swarmed over him

  i was busy picking up my gun and the
ammunition which had fallen when i heard
a shout of warning

  a wounded bull forced out of the line
by his injuries saw my plight and charged
toward me i raised my gun but to my
horror it missed fire in a moment the
frantic animal would have been upon me
had i not succeeded in sidestepping it but
with a snort of anger it whirled and made
at me again

  this time i could not have evaded it
although it was suffering from a bullet
wound through its withers and its side
was dripping with blood suddenly from
behind one of the rocks a lance-like arrow
winged its way striking the bull in the
side and passing completely through its
body

  it slackened its speed trembled and then
started on by this time i had my gun
ready and sent a bullet crashing behind its
right shoulder bringing it heavily to the
ground

  lying on his back as is the custom plac-
ing his toes against the center of his great
bow and pulling back the cord with both
hands appearing elk had sent a well-
directed arrow at the charging bull and
saved my life a sudden shift of the
wind sent the dust cloud around me until
i was almost blinded

  i was afraid any moment more buffalo
would come charging at me and i started


indian stories

on a mad dash in the direction of the
rocks of whose location i was not sure
as i struggled through the cloud i heard
the beat of hoofs and was raising my gun
to protect myself when to my relief i
saw man-afraid-of-his-horse galloping
swiftly toward me leading the two other
ponies

  mounting one of the animals which was
not gun-shy i galloped off and joined some
thirty other indians who were pursuing the
herd and showering them with arrows
from that time on i gave a good account
of myself five bulls being brought down
by my gun

  the main herd after skirting the hill
darted southwest but by this time we
had all the game we needed more than a
hundred buffalo had been brought down
and it was an invariable order from sit-
ting bull that the unkpappas should not
kill more buffalo than were needed by the
band

  while the braves assisted by a number
of squaws who had viewed the chase from
the distance were skinning the animals
and preparing the carcasses for removal to
the camp i hunted out my three compan-
ions appearing elk and crowfoot with
their long bows greeted me with smiling
faces opposite their ambush lay thirteen
dead bulls and three cows all of which had
fallen before their huge arrows

  him bad pony appearing elk ob-
served as i came up buffalo make him
behave

  damn the pony i shouted who was
it saved my life the bull would have
got me sure if it had not been for one of
you

  crowfoot pointed to appearing elk
who said not a word and i threw myself
from the pony and hugged the savage
while tears of gratitude streamed down
my face

  game little appearing elk a son of
the wilds but with a heart of gold as
an earnest of my thanks i presented him
that night with an old pepper-box revolver
the very first small arm i had ever
owned

  it was my most valued possession next
to my  calibre sharps rifle and it tore
my heart to part with it but a gift is not
a gift unless the giver feels a tugging at
his heart when he presents it

vi

several days passed uneventually
then-whoo-ooh hay-ay hay-hay
came an owl-like cry from the distance

  woo-ooh hay-ay hay-ay it was
cchoed from hundreds of throats

  dashing across the prairie a few hun-
dred yards away were a half dozen war-
riors shouting the battle cry and the vil-
lage was thrown into wild excitement

  ponies were hastily brought in from
their tethers and armed with bows and
arrows or guns or both according to their
equipment braves were preparing for
action

  without a word appearing elk and i
rushed to the village as fast as we could
leg it

  crowfoot was already astride his pony
as we drew near to my lodge

  taka-ahe-da the enemy where is he
shouted appearing elk

  the chiefs son pointed to the north

  sarcees he replied ten of our
young men were returning from a scout-
ing expedition and camped in an arroyo
twelve miles westward the sarcees creep
up in the night and steal their ponies
they awaken and try to give battle but
it is no use the enemy has their horses
and they cannot follow

  we did not wait for more particulars
it was evident the sarcees had fled north-
ward toward the canadian border for their
natural home was in the northwest terri-
tory and it was seldom they wandered so
far south even upon their frequent raid-
ing expeditions

  woo-ooh hay-ah yoo-we-do crow-
foot shrilled the war cry as he slapped his
pony and dashed away to the edge of the
village where the warriors were assem-
bling

  at the door of our lodge sitting bull
in war paint and feathers came striding
out

  ho mita koda welcome friend he
shouted with a show of enthusiasm at see-
ing me at the last moment get your rifle
and follow me

  but a moment was required for me to
arm myself and find my pony i clattered
up behind sitting bull and with the sioux
war cry ringing in my ears went off in my
first pursuit of an enemy
my life with sitting bull



   sitting bull requested me to ride beside
him

  there may be work for you today
he exclaimed with your rifle

   in a little more than an hour our party
which consisted of probably fifty had
reached the spot where the campers had
been robbed by the sarcees

  the thieves had a good start because
their victims had been forced to run on
foot to the village to spread the alarm
the trail was easily picked up a half
dozen braves who were especially adept at
tracking were sent ahead while the main
party followed at about a quarter of a
miles distance

  for hours we rode now and then losing
the trail because the enemy had expected
pursuit and had plunged into every creek
and traversed the bed for some distance
to throw us off the track

  in mid-afternoon the trail began to
grow fresher the jaded horses of the
enemy ridden as they had been for almost
thirty hours straight were in little better
fettle than those they had captured

  the scouting expedition returning
northeast had also ridden hard until well
into the night hoping to be able to reach
the village before they rested at last
however they had made camp in the ar-
toyo without knowing about the presence
of the sarcees who were heading south
and had evidently detected the sioux with-
out making their own presence known un-
til they had untethered the horses and
were making away with them

  our horses were in prime condition
none of them having been ridden hard ex-
cept for the rather short buffalo chase of
the previous day

   i was galloping along beside sitting bull
when gray foot one of the advance band
came riding to us talking excitedly

  sitting bull who had been observing
the trail closely knew his mission

  how far ahead are they he inquired

  less than an hours ride was the
reply

  immediately word was passed to the
pursuing party which extended its forma-
tion and proceeded ahead at redoubled
speed less than thirty minutes later we
heard the war cry sounded

  there was the crack of rifles as we
rounded the brow of a slight hill and a

quarter of a mile distant we saw our van-
guard engaged with the rear guard of the
enemy which consisted of perhaps twenty
sarcees

the advance party had been a trifle
too venturesome however and three
of the six including gray foot had been
wounded before sitting bull and the
rest of us could come within range the
sarcees were off like the wind to join
those who had preceded them

   sitting bulls men at once spread out in
a line which finally became two miles wide
and sought to outflank the enemy

  according to instructions i remained
beside the chief who by dint of hard rid-
ing soon caught up with the three unin-
jured members of the tracking party and
went at the head of the pursuing forces

  dusk was nearing when we finally
dashed into a stretch of small timber and
were caught in a shower of arrows and
bullets from the canadian indians who
had taken advantage of the shelter to at-
tempt to beat back our forces

  an arrow deflected by the bough of a
tree struck sitting bull in the shoulder
inflicting a slight wound he plucked out
the shaft with an exclamation of disgust
however and threw it on the ground

  it was tough going that dash through
the timber with the enemy well screened
and giving us the best they had in their
bag of tricks but we pressed on and
with the loss of two or three and the in-
jury of a dozen men finally drove the
sarcees into the open country beyond
they dispersed in frantic flight leaving all
of the ponies except their mounts to fare
as best they might

  as we darted out of the woods i noted
that there were no more than a dozen
sioux in sight

  where the others had gone was a mys-
tery to me until a moment later probably
twenty sarcees with a show of bravery
unusual for them came dashing headlong
toward us they had been flanked and
then encircled by the sioux on our left
and right and were evidently endeavoring
to regain the shelter of the trees they had
recently left

  sitting bull raised his old henry re-
peater and fired at the leader of the on-
coming band but the range was too great
	indian

a second time his rifle barked without do-
ing any damage

  reining my pony i took careful aim
with the heavy sharps rifle and to my
delight the leader of the sarcees lurched
forward from his pony drilled through
the chest

  a second shot knocked down the pony
of the indian immediately behind the first
victim and the rider went spinning on his

head

  by this time the range was getting short
enough for the chiefs repeater and the
nondescript weapons of some of our com-
panions in less than five minutes twelve
of the sarcees were on the ground and
the others had again headed north only to
be shot down by the flanking party who
refused to show them any mercy

  the skirmish over the surviving horses
of the sarcees having been captured and
the dead stripped of their arms we headed
south i called sitting bulls attention to
the wound in his shoulder which was
bleeding profusely

  its nothing eagle eyes he replied
you have done well today you killed
the wadutah shunktokecha red wolf
who led the thieves to steal our ponies
your courage delights my heart here-
after you are as my own son

  after an hours ride we encamped for
the night and the next morning started on
a hard ride to the village which we
reached after an absence of thirty-six
hours and without tasting food since our
departure

vii

the spring and summer that followed
were the most wonderful in all my
life we roamed the great open places of
the northwest with care-free hearts buf-
falo while not overly abundant were still
numerous enough to provide us plenty of
food and excitement

  the fishing was excellent and i fell into
the mode of the primitive with such fervor
that i would never have given it up if
fate had not held a black card in her hand
for my friend and mentor sitting bull

  a half dozen times we engaged in
brushes with crows who were continually
laying in wait to steal our horses whenever
we happened to be near their haunts and

stories

i must say i rather enjoyed their forays
because they served to break the monotony
of camp life

  sitting bull had been so well pleased
with the improvement in general marks-
manship of his warriors which he attribu-
ted to a large extent to my assistance that
i seemed to grow in his favor and i be-
lieve i was shown as many privileges in
the camp as was crowfoot himself

  late in the spring sitting bull who
apparently was most anxious for me to
learn all of the nature-craft for which the
sioux were famous assigned me to scout-
ing duty and even condescended to go
with my companions on our first trip

  a day out from camp we ran across a
small band of crows who had been hang-
ing onto our flank and occasionally pick-
ing up a few of our stray ponies we
overtook them after a wild ride across the
plain

  one of their number who was appar-
ently in command wore an elaborate head-
dress of yellow feathers i never did know
his name but apparently those gimlet-eyes
of sitting bull were able to make him out
although he was then half a mile away

  see sitting bull said as he reined
his pony beside me the crow with the
yellow feathers he is the leader of the
horse thieves if we get him we will not
be bothered again soon

  i knew from the intonation and gestures
that he wished the honor of killing the in-
dian rustler to rest on my shoulders and i
dashed away with all the speed of which
my pony was capable swinging to the left
and circling with a view to cutting off the
fugitive crows before they could reach
some hills in the distance which they were
evidently trying to make before giving
battle

  a half dozen of the unkpappas fol-
lowed close behind me at top speed but it
was probably a half hour before we came
in range but it was no ordinary indian
horse thieves we had encountered they
could ride like centaurs were well armed
and knew how to use their weapons

  seeing that they would be unable to
reach the hills before giving battle they
whirled and dropping along the sides of
their ponies with their rifles sticking out
under the necks of their steeds they swung
at right angles to us and began a hot fire
my life with sitting bull



the range however was too great at the
outset and their bullets merely kicked up
a rain of dust some two hundred feet in
front of us

  appearing elk who was a perfect devil
in a fight shot past me with a warwhoop
that would awaken the dead and dashed
madly at the enemy while i pounded my
ponys ribs in an effort to make it keep up
with my friend we had scarcely arrived
in range when a bullet passed through ap-
pearing elks shoulder and caused him to
drop his rifle and a moment later his pony
was shot from under him

  seeing the foremost sioux fall the
crow in the yellow headdress turned
abruptly to his left and rode straight for
us holding his rifle against his shoulder
and his bow and arrow in easy reach

  by this time i had reached the side of
appearing elk who was lying on the
ground blood trickling down his great
muscular arm which was now rendered
useless signing for me to pay no attention
to him but to open up on the enemy i
sprang from my pony held the rein over
my arm and took deliberate aim at the
wildly yelling crow who was bearing down
upon us

  as my big sharps cracked he threw up
his hands and leaned backward but the
ponys speed was unchecked and he con-
tinued his wild charge

  i quickly reloaded my gun and fired a
second shot which struck the pony in the
head and brought it to its knees probably
ten yards in front of me while the rider
was hurled almost at my feet

  the crow held up his hands for mercy
he had lost his weapons in the fall and
was quite powerless anyhow as blood was
gushing from a hole in his chest

  a moment later appearing elk sprang
to his feet and with his uninjured left arm
had raised his rifle high above him and
was about to bring it crashing down on
his enemys head when we heard a shrill
yell behind us

  it was the voice of sitting bull he
had started with the other sioux who had
swung to the left after the rest of the
crow band brought down one of the en-
emy and then had turned to witness the
outcome of my little private fight

  no cried the chief the crow has
fought bravely do not let your wound

make a brute of you 

  a moment later he was beside us bu
the death rattie was in the wounded mans
throat i picked up his rifle tore off his
headdress which i presented to the chief
and a moment later we were off after the
rest of the wildly scurrying crows by
this time they had been so badly shot up
that only two or three of the original
twelve were giving real battle the skirm-
ish did not last much longer

  appearing elks shoulder was badly in-
jured and another sioux had been killed
but aside from these there were no casual-
ties although only two of the crows as
far as we were able to determine made
their escape that night as we sat about
our campfire sitting bull placed his hand
on my shoulder in the presence of our
entire little band and said

  eagle eyes my heart beats for you
you have killed the thieving chief whom
i hate you have saved appearing elks
life you have a dacotahs heart

  his kind words fanned my pride to a
flame to be sure but they did not thrill me
as much as the knowledge that i had really
repaid appearing elk for his good turn in
preventing me from being gored to death
by a buffalo in my neophyte days i thus
expressed myself falteringly to sitting
bull

  his only reply was a grunt and a shrug
of the shoulders which may or may not
have indicated satisfaction sith my reply

viii

from that time on i acted as a sort of
bodyguard and a sort of gunman for
sitting bull never again did i participate
in any actual fights in which the chief was
engaged but on several occasions he di-
rected me to watch out for his particular
enemies when i was on scout duty and i
accounted for three of his most hated foes
to his great delight

  by midsummer the chiefs attitude
changed he was apparently preoccupied
and worried he was often in council
with gall lone bull crazy horse and
others of the powerful sioux chiefs he
had gathered about him

  i did not know what the trouble was
then but i know now it was because of
the difficulties the sioux were having with


indian stories

 the whites

   the big horn territory and the nbrth
platte had been ceded to the sioux by the
government and no white man under its
terms was permitted to settle there or to
pass through without the indians permis-
sion but the treaty was even then being
violated and a year later it was shame-
fully disregarded by the whites when gold
was discovered in the black hills and the
rush of prospectors to dakota and mon-
tana occurred

   but in the fall of  even war clouds
 were hanging low over us although i was
 kept in perfect ignorance of the situation
 and evidently was assigned to tasks that
 would keep me from coming into contact
 with the whites or learning what was go-
 ing on

   fowler and i seldom saw each other
and i doubt if he knew much more of the
true condition of affairs than i although
with his great experience he stood a much
better chance of getting correct infor-
mation

   for weeks the sioux had been promised
 a sun dance and at last the long delayed
 event was held it was the first and last
 one i ever care to see a test of courage
 and endurance that brings a shudder to me
 every time it comes to my mind just why
 this dance was held at this time now be-
 comes significant but it meant nothing un-
 usual to me then

   a young brave comes out to participate
 in the dance quickly a sub-chief assigned
 to the task takes a keen knife and makes
 two deep slits in the muscles of his back
 just over the kidneys the dancer must
 not allow an eyelash to quiver or a sound
 to escape his lips but must stand erect
 while a rawhide thong suspended from a
 pole is passed through the bleeding slits
 and he is lifted off the ground

   if he stands the task with the stoicism
 required he has proven his bravery if
 he has shown the slightest sigh of weaken-
 ing or faints he is branded a squaw and
 must be henceforth treated as one

   a half dozen or more young braves went
 through this sickening ceremony with
 credit to themselves according to their
 standards

   then out stepped one of the most hand-
 some indians i have ever seen muscled
  like a greek god and his face bearing the

 expression of a zealot who has flogged his
 courage to the sticking point and is eager
 and willing to step into the flames and die
 a martyr

  he stood like a statue while a muscular
hand grabbed the flesh back of his kidneys
and rudely thrust a hunting knife through
it there was never a quiver when the
operation was repeated a second time or
when the rawhide thong was drawn tight
and he was swept off the ground

  do what you will he shouted as the
blood trickled down his swinging legs and
formed a pool beneath him no one can
wring a moan from my lips i have the
heart of a dacotah i wonder if all of
you who look on can say as much 

  taunting his torturers defying them to
apply more violence and boasting of his
courage which although i had never seen
him before i knew was of the greatest
even though the test before my very eyes
had not demonstrated it to me he swung
for some time and then the flesh gave way
and he fell to the ground

  leaping up with a smile of triumph
rain-in-the-face shouted

  have i not proven my words  if you
doubt me you may swing me up again

sitting bull who had stood like a
piece of sculpture his gimlet-eyes
blazing as he heard the boasting of his
brave was apparently much displeased
with the cockiness of the warrior and the
taunts he had thrown out while undergo-
ing the torture perhaps sitting bull felt
that rain-in-the-face ambitious to become
a powerful sioux leader had aimed some
of his taunts at him

  with raised hand he stepped into the
circle

  do as he has bid you the chief ex-
claimed make the cuts deeper and let
him dance again perhaps his courage is
not quite as great as he would have us
believe

  sitting bull fixed his fiery eyes on the
younger man who met them steadily and
with the utmost indifference

  again the cruel knives tore more deeply
into his flesh again the rawhide thong
was passed through the wounds and he
was hoisted into the air singing shouting
and waving his long sinewy arms in a sort
of wild rhythm
my life with sitting bull



  i could stand the sight no longer and
withdrew but the sun dance went on
the following day i returned for a mo-
ment because i did not believe it possible
that rain-in-the-face was still enduring
that intense suffering without a moan

  but there he was as before only now he
was swinging more vigorously kicking in
an effort to force the tortured muscles to
tear loose and permit him to escape but
defiant and haughty as when he had first
stepped into the circle to meet the ordeal

  still a second day i returned drawn
to the spot by the horror of it his legs
encrusted with coagulated blood and a
scarlet trickle still oozing from around the
cruel thong but with his face aflame and
his spirit undaunted the warrior was as
defiant as ever

  but now his suffering was to cease sit-
ting bull was apparently discouraged at
the endurance shown by rain-in-the-face
or he was eager to reward him

  he watched the tortured brave for some
minutes then signed to some of the war-
riors in charge a moment later two heavy
buffalo skulls were tied to the feet of the
suspended stoic you could see the mus-
cles start to rip as the heavy weights were
attached but the war song only increased
in clearness as rain-in-the-face kicked
and tugged to show his indifference
at last after two days the flesh could
withstand the strain no longer and the
stoic dropped to the ground on the buffalo
skulls quickly he arose to his feet and
pointing to the throng about him his fin-
ger moving in a circle he cried

  now do you believe in me or am i a
squaw 

  sitting bull strode forward placed his
hand on the bronzed shoulder of the war-
rior whose lower limbs were reeking with
blood and shouted in words and tones
which permitted no misinterpretation
rain-in-the-face you are not a squaw
there are others as brave as the dacotahs
there are no dacotahs braver than you
hereafter you will sit high in the councils
of the dacotahs and you will be a scourge
to our enemies

  and the tortured hero was carried to
his tepee on the shoulders of admiring
friends amid the wildest shouts of ap-
proval in which i joined with all the

-indian stories-winter

strength of my lungs he had withstood
a test that no other sioux or for that mat-
ter any other man had ever stood

tie following day after rain-in-the-
face made his first appearance in
public i went out on a scouting expedi-
tion which lasted some time when i re-
turned there was an unmistakable gloom
about the camp sitting bull greeted me
with a frigidity that i could not under-
stand and it was not until little schch-
oka unburdened herself that night that i
learned the truth of the situation washe-
chu white men had come

  they had accussed rain-in-the-face of
slaying and scalping a soldier who was on
his way home from the fort and had
taken him away presumably to ft abra-
ham lincoln near bismarck no one knew
what his fate was to be

  my wifes voice dropped to a low whis-
per

  oh wamble ishta she said i fear
many troubles are in store my people
are so cruelly grieved by the way the
white men have acted

  they have taken almost everything
away from the dacotahs their land their
game their furs now they come and
seize brave rain-in-the-face and will per-
haps murder him

  sitting bull is growing more bitter
every day all the happiness has gone out
of his life he goes to his lodge alone
and makes medicine

  he talks with gall and crazy horse
and other chiefs until far into the night
my mother tell me we may expect a great
war and much sorrow

  tears came into her eyes her lips trem-
bled as she spoke and i knew she was
wondering whether the outcome of the
war she feared would mean our separa-
tion for she knew that i had an under-
standing with sitting bull that my hand
would never be raised against my own
people

  i comforted her as best i could and
tried to show her that if rain-in-the-face
had waylaid the soldier as had been
charged and afterward proven he must
take his medicine and there was no reason
why we should fear it would bring on a
war

  rain-in-the-face was brave yes very


indian stories

very brave but even the brave could be
very wicked  assured her and perhaps
after all rain-in-the-face had gotten just
what he deserved

  little robin put her hand up to my
mouth and an expression of terror came
over her face

  oh please please wamble ishta she
cried never never say that before my
people even sitting bull who looks on
you as his son would not spare you if he
heard you say that

  and to appease her i promised i would
not

the days passed slowly draggingdays
when happiness seemed to have left
every heart in the band and when it
seemed that any moment a spark might be
laid to the touchwood which greed had
scattered everywhere about us

  occasionally fowler and i got an op-
portunity to converse the old man real-
ized that the situation wa getting desper-
ate unless something happened soon to
pacify the sioux whose patience was at
the breaking point

  then one evening shortly before dusk
we saw a familiar erect tall figure astride
a foam-flecked pony silhouetted against a
thickening sky riding wildly toward the
camp a shout went up others rushed
out to see what had happened

  rain-in-the-face rain-in-the-face has
returned someone yelled and the cries
increased to the point of hysteria into
the village he dashed his ponys nostrils
distended and its legs quivering under the
strain of the whirlwind gallop like an
arrow the huge warrior leaped from his
steed and stood smiling as the sioux
people crowded around him with excite-
ment

  i have returned he shouted drawing
himself up to his six feet two but the
washeehu will see me again they will
see me and they will feel the weight of
my war club and the bite of my knife

  i tell you the indians on the reserva-
tion where the whites would have us all
placed are nothing but prisoners they
are slaves of the washechu but rain-
in-the-face will never again be their
prisoner

  i have felt the lash of the white mans
whip on my back my wrists have been
torn and my blood stained the chains with
which one of their chiefs tom custer
brother of general custer dragged me
behind a swift cart so that all might see
my humiliation

  the sioux may be made slaves but be-
fore they all are rain-in-the-face must
be killed some day i will meet that white
chief tom custer again i shall slay
him and eat his heart

  and having finished his heated har-
angue he strode off majestically for a
conference with sitting bull and other
chiefs

  rain-in-the-face liad escaped from the
prison at the fort through the kindness of
an american soldier who was disgusted
with the brutality with which he had been
treated and who had fired a shot in the
air as a bluff when the sioux darted out
of the opening which the guard had made
for him

  it was said in the village that rain-in-
the-face had urged the chiefs to make in-
stant war on the whites that the sugges-
tion had been frowned upon and that he
was very resentful as a result in any
event he disappeared from our band soon
afterward and i understand spent his
time with some of the more irreconcilable
of the sioux hostiles under inkpaduta
leader of the spirit lake iowa massacre
two moons and others

  sitting bull made considerable of the
fact that rain-in-the-face had owed his
liberty to a soldier and emphasized this as
an indication that some of the whites
really had hearts which went a long way
toward establishing a better feeling among
his followers

  gradually the tension lessened and
something approaching the old-time care-
free existence of the outfit returned we
hunted fished and trapped until the moon
of wild cherries september and then
started back to our winter quarters in the
black hills which was destined to be the
last time we should assemble there

  our hunting was confined very largely
that year to the vicinity of the black hills
where we went into winter quarters again
considerably earlier than the previous sea-
son

  the cold was not so extreme and while
my life with sitting bull



game was considerably scarcer than it had
been trapping still continued to be very
good and we led a rather contented exis-
tence from a physical standpoint but all
the time i kept seeing more and more in-
dications that a crisis might be expected
at any time

  sitting bull was less communicative
than when i had first met him but con-
tinued to show his usual friendliness for
me and was particularly glad that i was
able this winter to do much more work in
repairing and sighting the rifles which had
been considerably augmented from various
sources not revealed to me

late in april we broke camp and
started on our seasonal nomadic exis-
tence nothing of particular interest hap-
pened that spring except that by hook or
crook i was kept out of contact with
dad fowler except for a few minutes
late in may therf we had a conversation
in which the old man expressed a great
desire to get away from sitting bull and
complete our long contemplated trip to
new orleans it was rudely interrupted
by two braves whet summoned me to the
chiefs lodge

  the details of that conversation which
did not make a very decided impression
on my mind have escaped me except that
i noted sitting bull was unusually trou-
bled or professed to be about the scarcity
of game in the district and asked if i
would not like to take schch-oka and sev-
eral other braves and their squaws on a
hunting trip with a view tolocating a herd
of buffalo which were badly needed for
food

  life in the village had become quite irk-
some and i hailed the suggestion with
much gratification

  there was almost a note of tenderness
in the harsh voice of sitting bull as i bade
him goodbye he grasped my hand held
it in a vise-like grip for a few moments
and fastened his gimlet-like eyes on mine
as he said

  farewell wamble ishta may your
hunting trip be successful if the washe-
chu white men i have known were all
like you i would not have hate in my
heart as it is today

  he referred of course to the violation
of the treaty of  by the hordes of

white men who came pouring into the
black hills following the discovery of
gold though none were permitted by the
terms of the agreement to enter the terri-
tory without permission from the sioux
and the cry which the prospectors sent up
that all the indians be banished to reser-
vations	j

  he stood beside his pony waving fare-
well to me as i and my party started off
on the journey keeping those piercing eyes
on us until we disappeared from view

  as i have stated i do not know whether
the chief had anticipated a clash between
the sioux and the americans or not it is
unlikely that he did know when a battle
would occur but in all probability with
that strange gift of premonition he pos-
sessed he saw the inevitable was not far
away

  hunting was poor and our disappoint-
ment was keen when we failed to locate
any large numbers of buffalo after be-
ing away almost a month we started back
to join sitting bulls forces

  i can remember the afternoon of june
  with great vividness it was
quite by chance that we did not arrive back
in our camp on june  had we done so
i would have been with sitting bull at the
time of the custer massacre

  however as we neared the little big
horn we discovered some fresh buffalo
tracks and wasted almost a day following
them without success

  the afternoon of the th i noted that
it would be difficult to reach the village
until late and as we were wearied by our
long tnidge we made a camp about three
oclock and decided to complete the trip in
the morning

we heard considerable firing beyond
the little big horn but i paid little
attention to it thinking undoubtedly it was
some of sitting bulls braves shooting up
a marauding band of horse-stealing crows
the next day after crossing to the west
bank of the little big horn and ascending
a slope we came across a battlefield strewn
with dead

  general george a custer and his five
companies of  men had been sur-
rounded and the very firing that we had
heard the previous afternoon had sounded
the deathknell for every one of that heroic


indian stories

band

  i stood as one paralyzed surveying- the
bloody scene the bodies of horses and
men littered the slope but by far the ma-
jority of the victims had met death in a
group battling it out to the last man
against the overwhelming encircling force
which had subjected them to a withering
fire from every angle

  the name of custer meant nothing to
me at that time and i had no idea who
had led the victims into this death trap
many of the bodies had been terribly mu-
tilated stripped of equipment and cloth-
ing and scalped

  in one body i counted six arrows which
shows how determined had been the re-
sistance and how terrible the fire to which
the soldiers had been subjected

  the sight was so sickening that i could
not stand it long i do not know that i
actually saw custers body although i do
remember the form of one long-haired
man which had not been desecrated by the
victors

  i do not believe there was a single gun
or revolver left on the battlefield after the
sioux had moved on and robbed as they
were of their equipment and most of their
uniforms in addition to the mutilation
identification of any of the dead would
have been almost impossible

  the gruesome discovery fairly stunned
me i could hardly make up my mind
what to do or where to go i was a squaw
man made so by my captivity and my
youthful thirst for the picturesque and
novel where would i turn now

  would i endeavor to join the soldiers
which i knew would be swarming through
the district in pursuit of the sioux or
would i flee the district entirely

  my wife who had joined me as i re-
treated from the battlefield refusing to
join our companions who were rummag-
ing about among the dead with keenest
satisfaction saw the emotion which beset
me

  at last it has come oh wamble ishta
she exclaimed and tears trickled down her
stoical little lace

  the dead lie like leaves upon the
ground they are all palefaces it is as
sitting bull said when he returned from
making medicine but-may there be no
more battles

  it was a pathetic figure she presented as
she stood grief-stricken uttering the age-
old protest of her sex against the grim
game of war

  grasping little robin by the arm i
shouted to my companions to come with
us but they paid no heed to me-men and
women alike who had by this time given
up the search for plunder were taking
scalps from the dead

  it was with difficulty that i restrained
myself from opening fire upon them but
after all-that was their nature their war-
riors had won a great battle which had
been forced upon them because custer had
attacked them and from their viewpoint
they were entitled to the trophies of the
victory

  without more adieu i took little robin
by the arm and we wandered away in si-
lence for possibly three miles before i
could make up my mind to discuss the
future with her there is no need to go
into the heartaches of that conference

  she of course did not want to desert
her people and she was very insistent that
i pick up the sioux trail and join them
i pointed out that this was impossible that
it meant almost certainly i should be called
upon to fight against my own race for
there was no doubt that the white soldiers
would pursue sitting bull

  she talked for hours of sitting bulls
affection for me how he did not want war
and would not have fought the soldiers
had they not provoked the battle and she
professed to believe no more fighting would
take place

  at last i told her she must choose be-
tween sitting bulls people and me and
started back with deadwood as my ob-
jective

  for three days she accompanied me fre-
quently however grabbing me by the
arms and urging me to revoke my de-
cision or starting back westward again
running like a fawn and glancing over her
shoulder hoping that i would follow her

  finally after she had found this ruse
unsuccessful she bade me farewell with
bitter ears and started back over our trail
i had expected to see her turn again and
rejoin me but she never did and i pur-
sued my way with a heavy heart

  during the long journey to deadwood
the details of which i shall not recount i
my life with sitting bull



made up my mind that wamble ishta
would go out of existence and walter j
winters would again take his place

   the first place i should head for i said
to myself was a barber shop where my
long black tresess would be snipped off
after which i would array myself in the
white mans more burdensome clothing
 and go back to civilization for good so
much for resolutions

x

upon reaching deadwood i bethought
myself of the fact which had not oc-
curred to me that money was needed in
civilization and the few dollars i had car-
ried with me during all these years were
not enough to get me very far

   perhaps i had best set about to find a
job before i indulged in a transformation
that was easier said than done and after
a few days of failure i found myself
wondering all the time what had become
of sitting bull and wishing that i had at
least looked into the situation more care-
fully before heading east

   the spell of the aborigine i found was
still in my views and the less colorful ex-
istence of the white man had not yet of-
fered a strong appeal wamble ishta
had refused to kick in

   at last i fell in with a party of immi-
grants who were heading for northern
montana they wanted a guide and of-
fered me the job while my experience
in that country was meager i readily ac-
cepted and we started off eventually ar-
riving at our destination

   my services were no longer in demand
and i was again without plans for the
future

  try as i would i could get no word
at all of dad fowler at last i came to
the conclusion that i would rejoin sitting
bull if possible if for no other reason
than to learn my old companions fate and
perhaps i could le of assistance to him

   big eyes i knew had never had the
standing with the great chief that i had
and it occurred to me that perhaps he was
longing to escape from the band and
would be unable to do so unless perhaps
i could prevail upon sitting bull to per-
mit him to leave

   in the vicinity of old fort lincoln quite

by chance i came across two indians who
had escaped from the reservation and
were attempting to find their way back to
sitting bull they had been captured
some weeks before and had promised to
stay on the reservation but had taken
french leave at the first opportunity

both of them had or professed to
have participated in the battle of the
little big horn they both remembered
me well although i did not know them
and readily gave their version of the bat-
tle

  i was not so much interested in the de-
tails of the fight as i was in the present
whereabouts of sitting bull and the fate
of big eyes as to the chief they did
not know but when i mentioned fowler
they became reluctant to talk

  realizing that something was wrong i
pressed them for details i told them of
my fast friendship for appearing elk
how i had saved his life and he had saved
mine of the high regard with which their
chief held me

  finally they told me poor old dad was
dead he had refused to participate in the
battle and in a burst of anger had been
struck down and killed by rain-in-the-
face who professed to believe he had
been guilty of an attempt at treachery

  i learned afterward from lone eagle
whose foster father was in the battle that
the real reason for fowlers assassination
was the fear that he might tell the whites
some of the details of the massacre he had
witnessed

  you can readily realize what a terrible
blow the announcement was to me dad
fowler had been my friend through thick
and thin and i had learned to look upon
him with the same reverence respect and
even love as though he had been my own
father

  the announcement had ruthlessly shoved
all the romance out of my dreams of re-
joining sitting bull there was but one
more thing i wished to know

  what of schch-oka

  she had in some miraculous way man-
aged to join her people and had married
a young brave who had distinguished him-
self in the battle of the little big horn
and had thus met with great favor from
sitting bull


indian stories

  the two sioux urged me to accompany
them in the search for sitting bull who
was then being buffeted from pillar to post
by the soldiery

  i shook my head

  sitting bull i said has no doubt
forgot wamble ishta and wishes to see
him no more	i

  but they hastened to reassure me eagle
eyes one of them interrupted you are
mistaken sitting bull has asked for you
many times he tried every way to find
a trace of you and then schch-oka re-
turn and say you have gone toward the
rising sun that make him very unhappy
come with us

  that night when they were asleep i
crept away and started off through the
wilderness alone resolved to go into the
northwest territory

the following spring after taking
french leave of the wandering sioux
found me in what is now northern sas-
katchewan

  there again wamble ishta triumphed
over walter winters and to make a long
story short i bought a handsome young
squaw for a bucket of sugar and lived
with the blackfoot indians for more than
a year

  the fishing and trapping were excellent
although the big game hunting had not
come up to my expectations i had man-
aged to get considerable out of trapping
and possibly i should have been contented

  i engaged in a few brushes with pillag-
ing sarcees and seemed to be in the good
graces of the chief who went by the name
of a much more famous indian of an
earlier period black hawk

  he however possessed few of the sterl-
ing qualities of sitting bull he was not
a born leader as was the great sioux chief
and i was shown little more considera-
tion than any other member of the band

  possibly i had been spoiled by the favor-
itism sitting bull had shown me at any
rate i determined to leave the blackfoot
and head for british columbia

  my squaw e-tah-tah but whom i had
given the english name of elsie was de-
termined to accompany me west and i
was equally determined that she remain
behind with her mother i divided equally
with her my posessions ponies equipment

and furs and prepared to say farewell
but the blackfoot lady was not disposed
to have it that way

  rising to her full height and with flash-
ing eyes she wanted to know why she
could not accompany me i replied that
the trip into the wild country would be
one of many hardships which a woman
should not attempt to undergo

  and am i a child she demanded
am i a weakling that i cannot go where
any white man-blackfoot or white-can
go no that is not the reason you may
kill me but you cannot leave me behind

  i tried all of my forensic powers upon
her but there was no way of changing her
mind so i pretended to give up the idea of
the trip for the present that night i
stole away from the lodge and by morn-
ing was thirty miles away because of the
danger of roving indians who might take
a liking to my horses and who were none
too friendly with the whites i slept during
the day and traveled by night

  the third day out i had hobbled my
horses in some heavy brush and prepara-
tory to starting on another days march i
ascended a little knoll to take my bearings
shortly before sundown

  to the east i caught a glimpse of a
pony whose rider was proceeding cautiously
and evidently studying my trail convinced
that i was in trouble i made my way
down and coolly took up a position behind
a boulder a few hundred yards east of my
camp with my rifle aimed at the new-
comer who was then almost in range

  i had decided that it was probably better
to shoot and ask questions later and was
about to squeeze the trigger when the
rider who was leaning low over the far-
ther side of the pony chanced to straighten
up and it flashed upon me that elsie was
my pursuer

  oh kill me she shouted kill me if
you will but do not make me turn back

  she had followed me for three days
picking up my trail with that rare instinct
which all indians possess and making bet-
ter headway than i had for she had left
our lodge some six hours after i did

  i hadnt the heart to tell her to turn
back

  come with me little one i said as
long as you will i will never try to leave
you again
my life with sitting bull



  she threw herself at my feet and clasped
her arms about my knees

  to the end of the world she sobbed
and i believe i was as happy as she that
we had been reunited

  we returned to the blackfoot camp got
all of our outfit and then proceded west
together no one ever had a better pal on
a journey of that kind

  for five years we wandered throughout
the far northwest finally going on a
mackenzie river expedition with two
swede boys whom i had met in deadwood

  we had decided to start a trading post
at the head of the yukon and at great
slave lake traded our outfit for dogs and
proceeded to mush the district none of
us were fitted for his sort of traveling
however

  the snow eventually became very deep
and after getting lost in a blizzard but
finally getting our bearings we gave up
and returned east

  elsie and i took up a ranch not far from
the present city of calgary

  a year later elsie died and i got a job
as boss of a pack train and went to fort
benton thence to lewiston finally doub-
ling back to deadwood again where i
hunted up the first available barber and
had my long black tresses cropped close to
my scalp

  the barber who seemed to think my
long hair would make a good ornament
for his shop tied a string around the long
locks and hung them in his window when
i stepped out of the barber shop wamble
ishta was no more

  walter winters had taken his place
never again did i go back to indian life
i finally fell in love with a school teacher
from the east and we were married
eventually settling on the ranch on which
the town named after me is located we
have since raised a family and have pros-

squaw killer

        by james g blade

     scorned by his fellow warriors taunted by the re-
     lentless foe the wolf works his own brand of sho-
     shone medicine on the squaw-killing pahkee axe-man

the wolf flung his axe

end over end it hurtled through
the air and smashed into the skull
of the pahkee warrior it was aimed at the
pahkee fell screaming from his horse the
wolf glanced around at the nine warriors
who with a constant deadly stream of
arrows were still fighting off the thirty
pahkees

  but it couldnt last the odds against
them were too heavy

  there had been thirteen shoshone war-
riors and their women and children in
the little buffalo-hunting party when the
pahkees attacked but three of the sho-
shones lay dead between there and the
river where the fight had started while
the warriors covered their retreat the
women and children were urging the slow
travois horses-packed with all the sho-
shones camp gear and winters buffalo
meat-toward a high square butte

  a magnificently-proportioned pahkee
mounted on a great spotted pony with
long legs and a barrel chest left his fel-
lows and came thundering up the wolf
waited coolly his eyes taking in every
detail of horse and rider the horse was
the finest he had ever seen

  the wolf nocked an arrow waited un-
til the pahkee was within thirty feet of
him and shot

  but the pahkee received the arrow on
his buffalo-hide shield then lowered the
shield and launched his own arrow gray
badger fighting beside the wolf gasped
and fell from his horse with the arrow
through his throat his riderless pony
went pounding away a pahkee cut from
the band and caught it

  even the biting anger that the death
of gray badger the husband of his sis-
ter inspired in the wolf could not sup-
press the great admiration he felt for the


pahkee it was a daring thing to do
and a taunting yell arose from the pah-
kees as the warrior on the spotted horse
wheeled and thundered away a storm of
shoshone arrows followed but none
touched him

  the wolf glanced behind him lash-
ing the travois horses and running them-
selves the women and children were very
near the butte now at a signal from
the wolf the warriors turned and rode
toward them the wolf thought long-
ingly of turning around pitting himself
against the warrior on the spotted horse
but that was impossible his was the
leadership of the shoshone band and he
was responsible for them he rode half
turned about in the saddle watching the
pahkees thundering pursuit the war-
riors on the spotted horse rode ten feet
ahead of the rest but drew back when
the wolf slowed a little all the pahkees
had learned a wholesome respect for the
wolfs bow

  swinging around to look at the women
and children the wolf bent over the neck
of his own war horse the horse re-
mained as cool as its rider and the wolf
patted his neck approvingly no warrior
worthy of the name could fight unless he
had a good horse to hear him but the
spotted horse  if the wolf had that
he would be better mounted than any
other shoshone

again when the wolf raised his
hand the shoshones wheeled sud-
denly and loosed a flight of whispering ar-
rows close at their heels and unprepared
because their enemies were on the run the
surprised pahkees drew up the nine sho-
shones shot nocked their bows and shot
again three of the pahkees fell a
horse screamed and stampeded with two

indian stories

arrows in its flanks two more tumbled
to the ground flinging their riders over
their heads

  keeping his shield up the warrior on
the spotted horse again rode in front of
his companions seeking an opportunity to
thrust with his lance-apparently he had
already shot all the arrows in his quiver
the wolfs arrow thudded against the
shield and bounded off but no shoshone
aimed at the spotted horse

  taking advantage of the pahkees con-
fusion the shoshones again turned and
thundered toward the women and chil-
dren now within a few feet of the trail
leading up the butte the retreat had
been well covered-no pahkee had been
able to get any booty save the horses of
the fallen shoshones and none of the
women or children were harmed the
wolf drew his fighters into battle array
at the foot of the trail leading up the
butte as the women each urging two or
three travois horses started single file
toward the buttes summit when the
last of the women and children were
gone the warriors loosing their horses
to follow and holding their bows ready
began the perilous ascent on foot

  a curtain of thick yellow dust arose at
the bottom of the dry butte the pah-
kees were dim almost unseen shapes
through it the last warrior to dismount
the wolf slapped his horse on the rump
and started it up the narrow steep trail
hewn in the face of the butte walking
backwards his bow nocked the wolf be-
gan the ascent

  from somewhere out in the dust a tiny
cry cut through the din of battle a wo-
man shrieked and her hurtling body left
the trail to land sprawled in the dust at
the bottom of the butte for a second
she lay motionless there then got up and
started running frantically toward the
pahkees

  it was the wolfs sister duck woman
in the melee her baby had somehow been
left behind and she had returned for it
the wolf cursed started running back
down the trail

  for a bare second the dust cleared
and he saw the pahkee on the spotted
horse riding furiously toward the girl
he came beside her raised his axe and
sank it in her skull she wilted to the

ground the pahkee picked the baby up
swung it gleefully aloft and carried it
back to his fellows

on top of the butte the wolf sat
alone their gaudy blankets reveal-
ing only their glistening black hair and
dusky faces the women gathered together
and did not speak not understanding
and afraid because they could not under-
stand the children crouched close to their
mothers and either whimpered softly or
were silent two of the shoshone war-
riors bows in their hands and a great
heap of arrows by their side sat at the
head of the trail any pahkee who at-
tempted the ascent had to come up the
path and there was room for only one
person at a time on it the men could
easily defend the butte against any attack
by the pahkees

  naked except for breech-clouts and
moccasins scalp locks rising from the
center of their shaven glistening heads
the six warriors not on guard duty sat
with their backs to the wolf the wolf
writhed under their unspoken contempt
he who had been one of the mightiest
warriors who had gained great honors in
battle and had even counted coup on the
feared grizzly bear must return to his
village-provided any of the band re-
turned there at all-a shunned contempt-
ible tiling whose tasks from now on would
be to help the women he could not ride
to war any more would not even be al-
lowed to hunt

  gray badger had died as a warrior
should die in honorable battle no one
need feel sorry for him and none need
reproach himself because he had not been
able to help him but the most abject
disgrace any warrior could suffer was to
see his woman killed by an enemy with-
out avenging her-at the cost of his own
life if necessary being already dead
gray badger could not avenge duck wo-
man but the wolf was her brother
challenging the pahkee who rode the
spotted pony was both his task and sworn
duty

  the baby would go to some pahkee
village and there le reared as a pahkee
he would probably be adopted by some
family who had lost a son to the sho-
shones
squaw

  the wolf arose and stalked over to
the edge of the butte to look down the
pahkees had made their camp about two
hundred yards away from the base of the
butte an insulting yell arose from them
when they saw the wolf the horses
were picketed but the warrior who had
ridden the spotted horse walked a little
way toward the butte and with shouted
contempt dared the wolf to come down
for a bit the wolf stood silently-pahkee
arrows would not carry this far-and
turned to survey his own camp

  the shoshones were in no danger-
now they had meal and buffalo meat
in plenty and the pahkees could not storm
the butte but in the buffalo-stomach wa-
ter bags there was only water enough for
three days at the most then they would
soon have to surrender the men would
be tortured the women sold as slaves or
-if they were lucky-the younger and
more attractive ones would be taken as
wives by the pahkees and die children
would be inducted into the pahkee tribe

  the wolf stalked over to stand in
front of the warriors who ignored him
by staring stonily ahead the wolfs eyes
sought running antelope next to himself
the strongest warrior present slowly and
with immense dignity running antelope
raised his head to look contemptuously at
him the wolf spoke quietly

  we will hold a council

  by what right does a coward summon
a council

  by this right

  the wolf stooped swiftly snatched up
the fine axe that lay beside running an-
telope and held it threateningly over him
some of the scorn in running antelopes
eyes gave way to respect for the wolfs
audacity

  do you think anything you may do
in council will atone for what you failed
to do in battle running antelope asked
do you think any words you may utter
will speak as loudly as the deeds you did
not do when duck woman was stricken
down and her child taken captive

  at the present time i am not con-
cerned with myself or my own honor
the wolf said i am worried about the
safety of the people i brought here if
we sit and do nothing the pahkees will
have us as soon as our water is gone

killer	

  a chorus of grunts arose from the
warriors they arose and brushed past
the wolf toward the two men watching
at the head of the trail-all warriors
must be included in the council

  the wolf stood a moment and fell in
behind them but he swerved from the
line of march to approach the women
he bent over his wife white doe and
said build a lodge

when the wolf got to the head of
the trail running antelope was
speaking the wolf caught the end of
his speech

  -are we warriors or cowards i
say that we can go down and fight the
pahkees if we win it will be a glorious
victory if we lose our names will be
forever honored as men who dared what
do you say brothers are we to remain
here and let the pahkees conquer us with
no fight or are we going to conduct
ourselves as warriors should

  the assembled warriors leaped to their
feet brandishing axes and bows

  fight they chanted let us go
down and fight

  from where he had been standing al-
most unnoticed on the outskirts of the
council the wolf stepped up beside run-
ning antelope a sullen murmur arose
but quieted when the wolf started to
speak

  let no one think running antelope a
coward but also let no one think him
anything but a fool he knows and every
warrior here knows that an attack on the
pahkees is madness all of us would be
killed still were we warriors alone i
too would favor such an attack but we
are not warriors alone we are the
guardians of women and children of our
tribe

  you black water have a nine year
old son over there already he is an
excellent horseman and has killed buffalo
he promises to be a mighty warrior
what flavor will your honored name have
when you look down from the spirit
land and see tliat boy riding with the
pahkees against his own flesh and blood
you owl have a daughter who some
day will be the wife of a chief what
will the fact that you rode into battle
against hopeless odds mean when you see

her the plaything of pahkee youths 
there is not one of us including run-
ning antelope who will not be delivering
our own flesh and blood into pahkee
hands after we have died in battle is
tliat what we want does that befit sho-
shones or does it more befit us to out-
wit these dogs who think they have us
trapped 

  there was a moment of silence run-
ning antelope broke it

  and does the wolf have any sugges-
tions as to how we are to do that

  i do for years these pahkees have
raided our villages killed our men and
captured our women and children but
they never attack unless they outnumber
us we can both escape from here and
avenge some of their previous raids the
pahkee country is three days ride to the
south one days ride west is one of our
villages with forty warriors if we send
a person to that village we can bring
those warriors here and kill all the pah-
kees or if they take warning and
escape we can still run them down be-
cause except for the spotted horse all
our horses are fleeter than theirs

 the wolf stepped back and running
antelope took his place

 we condemned the wolf because he
did not avenge duck woman he said
seriously now we know that it is not
his fault-his mind was wandering does
he not know that a single warrior could
not even get to the bottom of this cliff
before all the pahkees would be on him
and strike him down does he not real-
ize that one warrior could not live for
the space of ten heartbeats with all the
pahkees against him

  i know that the wolf said but
we will not send a warrior we will send
a woman

  aye anger flared in running an-
telopes eyes and his words dripped con-
tempt let a woman do our work watch
another woman killed before our eyes
so that we may have one more insult to
atone for when we face the manitou

  the wolf gripped the axe in his hand
until his nails bit deep into the palm

  a woman will get through he said
fiercely my plan will work but even
if it should fail you have my word of
honor that i myself will kill or be killed

by the pahkee who killed duck woman
then all our souls will be clean mine
is the only good plan im going to en-
force it with the strength of my arm
anyone who disagrees may fight me now
if he kills me let him assume the leader-
ship if he can not kill me i am still
chief

  there was muttering among the war-
riors the wolf waited calmly knowing
that he could force his way owl rose
and gestured for silence

  the wolf will try his plan but he
will answer to us for it if it fails he
will not get a chance to fight the pahkee
he will die here at the hands of his
fellow-warriors

  the wolf turned back toward the wo-
men who had erected a buffalo skin lodge
he stopped by white doe

  bring the small black horse with the
black tail and come into the lodge he
ordered

save for the wolf who remained in
the lodge and the two warriors who
stayed to guard the head of the trail the
assembled shoshones stood together to
watch white doe ride the black pony out
of the lodge the ponys black tail had
been clipped short no doubt to make
some medicine the wolf thought best
white doe sat astride the saddle the
blanket falling over the ponys flanks to
cover her feet and pulled up to conceal her
face so that only her glistening black hair
showed

  running antelope glanced threateningly
at the lodge and took one step as though
to follow the black pony but he drew
back it was the wolfs business and
the wolf would pay the penalty if it
failed

  the two guards at the head of the
trail stepped aside to let the pony pass
and the shoshones crowded to the edge
of the butte to look down there was
no sound from them only tense breath-
lessness even the youngest child a baby
four months old did not cry but seemed
to sense the import of the moment

  then the pahkees saw the pony and
its rider and a derisive howl arose run-
ning- antelope and owl strung their
bows walked nervously toward their
squaw

horses and came back to the edge of the
butte it was as though some potent mag-
netic force drew them there as though
they could not leave

  keeping the pony at an easy trot
white doe rode halfway down the trail
another gust of laughter came from the
palikees the warrior who rode the
spotted horse swung to the saddle

  the black pony came to the bottom of
the butte and white doe kicked him into
a gallop as she swung i out on- a course
that would take her straight out from the
butte and quartering past the pahkees
the pahkees were silent now courage
even in a woman could be respected the
warrior on the spotted horse-the squaw
killer-left his companions and thundered
down on the galloping black pony

  a groan of despair arose from the
watching shoshones the pony was one of
the slowest horses if the wolf had
mounted her on one of the fleet animals
white doe might have a chance

  now she had none the great spotted
horse was closing the distance between
them gaining three feet on the black
pony for every ten feet they ran

  ttie pahkee raised a mace began to

killer	

chant his war song-which was another
distinct honor for a woman the spotted
horse closed the distance between himself
and the black pony to fifteen feet and
the pahkee poised his mace for the kill

  suddenly the blanket fell from the
black ponys rider to reveal not white
doe but the supple muscular length of
the wolf

  the shoshones yelled hysterical en-
couragement while the startled pahkees
leaped to their horses the wolf waited
gave the spotted horses rider ample time
to see that he faced a warrior instead of
a woman they came together and the
pahkee swung his mace the wolf
ducked leneath it to come up unharmed
moving almost lazily the wolfs axe arm
rose and fell the pahkee fell to the
ground and the wolf was on the spotted
horse-the fleetest horse the pahkees had
on top of the butte running antelope
gasped then-

  you did not really think that the wolf
would let duck woman go unavenged
as one the shoshones turned white
doe the pride she felt flashing from her
black eyes stood in front of the lodge
her blanket gone she was dressed only
in white buckskins she spoke again

  the wolf bade me stay hidden so that
no word or gesture from any of you
might betray to the palikees that a war-
rior instead of a woman was riding that
horse

  he dressed himself in my blanket
and wrapped the horses tail about his
head for hair the wolf my husband
should have another name he is cunning
as a wolf daring as an eagle and strong
as a grizzly bear

  running antelope looked from her
down to where the wolf and his swift
horse were only a vanishing cloud of dust
in the distance he looked back and his
voice was very respectful

  aye white doe the mightiest war-
rior of all

by alexander wallace

            in the proud hearts of the dakota there is but one way
            for young braves to settle their squaw-feuds fight
            fight hard and savage    until one can rise no more

the seven council fires of the
tenton-dakota burned in the shadow
of the black hills for it was the
moon of fatness the season when natose
the sun is highest in the sky and the grow-
ing power of the earth is strongest the
tipis of the ogala hunkpapa miniconjou
two-kettle brule sans arc and the
blackfeet were thrown out in a huge
circle the flight of two buffalo arrows
across away in the centre of the camp
stood the skeleton of the sun dance
lodge already up and awaiting the actual
day of the dance when it would be quickly
enclosed with evergreens-all but the top
which would be left open so that natose
might shine down upon his own

  hundreds of sleek wild-eyed pomes had
been turned out to graze on the rolling
grassland surrounding the camp they
whinnied and kicked their heels high in
the air or pranced stiff-legged in a circle
tails and heads raised high showing off
their wild beauty to the youngsters who
romped with them

  within the painted circle of the tipis
the buffalo grass curled close to the ground
and from its roots came the rasping song
of the grasshopper all through the en-
campment forms were moving with a
quiet dignity that gave purpose to their
movement and here and there a horse-
man with the sacred red and yellow sym-
bols of the auhuminea the camp-police
painted on his bronzed skin

  in the shade of a tipi kitsipon son of
the hunkpapa chief thunder face stood
watching daybreak star through the open
flap of her fathers lodge he was tall
and handsome but he was young and he
had yet to take an enemys scalp and
therefore no eagles feather tipped with
horse hair dangled from his glossy head

  he stood watching the girl his face



impassive while under his fine blanket
his heart pounded like a dance drum it
was always so when he looked upon day-
break star the more so now because the
shadow of the tipi was growing very long
and there was a tryst to keep down by
the river where the black-throated buntings
sang and swayed on the reeds

  now the shadow reached to his feet
and gradually deepened daybreak star
came out of the lodge skin water bag in
hand she stood for a moment tall and
slender her braided hair flowing in two
glossy streaks over her fringed deerskins
her eyes found kitsipon she smiled and
then took the trail down to the river
kitsipon waited for a time then followed
the girl his step had the spring of the
bow in it but it was not indecorously
hurried

the shadow of the cottonwoods
that fringed the river fell across the
hunkpapa section of the camp a steep
trail led through them down to the sandy
bottoms a barred owl sent his booming
call echoing through the woods and a
whip-poor-will scolded like an old woman
kitsipon quickened his pace as he passed
from sight of the camp but scarcely
had he entered the darkening woods when
a horse blew loudly through its nostrils
then suddenly a tall figure stepped out of
the bush and came to a stand on the
trail before him

  a swift flame of anger came into
kitsipons eyes as he recognized ingrona
son of the hukpapa shaman long ghost
ingrona spoke

  there is a thing that troubles my
mind i want to talk to you about thi
thing

  how said kitsipon and looked
straight into the others eyes
crouching kitsipon met the charge in the next
instant ingrona went tailing over hit shoulder
	indian stories

  for a long time i have thought about
this thing my heart is heavy with it

  ho kitsipons eyes flashed now
is not the time to talk of this thing that
troubles your mind ingrona he said
come to my fathers lodge tonight we
will talk then he made as if to move
down the trail but ingrona quickly
stepped into his path and confronted him
again

  we talk now he said and folded his
arms across his deep chest

  kitsipon stood utterly motionless look-
ing deeply into the others eyes he was
a two-feather man this ingrona and he
had the savage alert look of his name-
sake the panther he always wore the
finest buckskins and under his blanket he
carried a long knife he was older than
kitsipon by three summers as far back
as kitsipon could remember the shamans
son had always been standing in his path
it was strange but always he seemed not
to want a thing until kitsipon reached out
his hand to grasp it it had been so since
childhood and this had made them strong
rivals at every turn and now it seemed
they were to be rivals in love for this
was no chance meeting the scowl on
ingronas face told kitsipon that

  what is this thing that troubles your
mind he asked

  last night my father spoke of this
thing he said we must think of a
woman for you it is time you were
thinking of a woman my son i have
spoken to iron robe the father of day-
break star for you 

  kitsipon felt his face getting hot

  this is the thing i came to talk of
ingrona went on while my father talks
with iron robe it is not a good thing for
you to talk with daybreak star i have
spoken

  kitsipons attention was drawn down
the trail daybreak star was coming back
when she saw the two young men stand-
ing there glowering at each other she
came to a stand then put her hand over
her mouth and sped past them as swift
as a shadow over the grass

  kitsipon looked steadily at ingrona for
some time then he said it is not a good
thing that your father has done i have
put my blanket around daybreak star all
the people have seen this it is known that

i	will take her-

  ho ingronas teeth showed in a
derisive grin you are not a man yet
when you put your blanket around a girl
you play at love as boys play at war the
people know this i think

  cante sica the words came hissing
from between kitsipons clenched teeth
at the same time he leaped back letting
his blanket fall to the ground

  i am man enough to split your heart
he said and drew his knife

  ingrona tossed aside his blanket steel
flashed as he crouched the fingers of his
left hand touching the ground there was
a moment of silence in which their eyes
locked as each sought to measure the
strength of the others resolution in this
silent duel ingronas gaze was the first
to fall away

the youth that confronted him
was a boy in years but he had a
mans body and there was no fear in his
steady unwinking stare ingronas eyes be-
came sly and flicked around like a snakes
tongue and then kitsipon sprang at him

  but ingrona was too quick for him he
leaped aside and his long knife ripped
through kitsipons buckskin shirt but did
not draw blood kitsipon whirled to attack
again but just then hoof beats sounded
on the trail out of the tail of his eye
kitsipon saw his father galloping toward
them followed by two of the camp-police
feathers fluttered from the ceremonial
pipe the old chief carried in his hand he
rode his pony between the combatants

  a hu ustan he shouted and waved
the pipe over his sons head gritting his
teeth kitsipon sheathed his knife and stood
silent thunder face dropped from his
pony and the look he gave his son was as
blade as the thunder cloud

  it is well he said bitingly that we
have girls to watch our young men when
the son of a hunkpapa chief would shed
the blood of his own at this holy time it
is well indeed i think

  kitsipon looked down at the ground and
muttered he called me a boy my
father

  ho did he challenge your war record
my son

  ingrona made an ugly sound in his
throat then he has taken a few crow
moccasitsed death



ponies he said is that a record a man
would boast of

  the chief turned and looked at him
steadily for a moment then he said quietly
draw your knife my son now ingrona
if you wish to call my son a coward come
forward and touch the point of his knife

  ho ho approved the two mounted
braves and turned expectant eyes upon
the shamans son but now ingrona looked
down at the ground

  i do not wish to shed blood at this
holy time he said

  there are many days in the year the
chief told him

  i will not touch his knife point now
said ingrona sullenly

  the chiefs smile came and went just
for a moment it softened his deeply
grooved face his mouth relaxed and a
gleam of humor changed his eyes it was
a fleeting glimpse of the man under his
cold stern exterior and in a moment his
expression became hard again

  you both speak with forked tongues
i think he said it is not your honor
you would defend like men there is noth-
ing in your heads but girls our people do
not fight over girl with knives tonight i
will talk of this thing in council with the
scalp shirt men go now i have spoken

the moon came up out of the
plains and made a ghost world of
the camp the tipis were silhouetted by
the fires that burned within and the
shadows of their occupants danced around
them like crazy spirits from the nether
world wolves drawn by the scent of the
camp howled out in the hills the dogs
slinked to the shelter of the lodges or
stood with the hair standing along their
backs answering the challenge of the
plains in low gruff yelps-they could not
bark there was too much wolf in them
for that

  presently the voice of mitevwin the
big medicine drum spoke to the night
then the camp-crier came shouting
through the camp calling the scalp shirt
men to the council lodge

  kitsipon stood outside his fathers
lodge looking out toward the hills his

-indian stories-winter

mother sat hunched over the lodge fire
only her eyes showing above the edge of
her blanket she had borne four sons
but three had died long ago and her
heart was full of fear for the one that
was left to her she kept saying over and
over again

  i do not know about this thing will
there be trouble my son

  kitsipon went into the lodge and sat
cross-legged before the fire when the
council is over we will know my mother
they talk and talk said the mother
i will tell your father to give ponies to
long ghost then this trouble will be
no more

  he reproved her sternly i give no
ponies to long ghost or his son may i
never set foot in another snow if i do
that he put more wood on the fire it
crackled and flared pushed back the
shadows and showed the clean proud lines
of his young face looking at him the
mothers eyes lost their clouded look

  it was a bad thought she said softly
unworthy of the mother of a chief it
has passed into the shadows my son
kitsipon smiled then stretched out on
his skin pallet between the fire and the
door of the lodge as he lay there his mind
fondled the hope that the council of
chiefs would forget his youth and grant
him the warriors right to settle his quar-
rel with ingrona in some trial of strength
and skill

  his fathers light step awakened him
and he sprang to his feet instantly alert

  tomorrow at sunrise you wrestle with
ingrona the old man answered the un-
spoken question in his eyes

  kitsipons eyes shone in the darkness
it is good i thank my father he said

  the chief moved into a beam of moon-
light it showed the wry smile that came
to his lips as he said if you are thrown
we leave this camp  foot my son long
ghost is angry he has wagered many
ponies

  the crows have plenty ponies my
father said kitsipon absently

  ho the old man swung around to
face him then added sharply you lose
and you lose daybreak star i have
spoken

  how gasped kitsipon

  crows got plenty girl too said the
	indian

did man with a dry chuckle and went to
his bed

  like a whisper in the night the decision
of the scalp shirt men had passed from
tipi to tipi and the whole encampment
was astir before natose shot his flaming
arrows skyward then miteywin shat-
tered the crystal silence of hills into frag-
ments and there was a general movement
toward the lodge of sounding sky the
head chief of the dakota clans the camp-
police rode yipping through the throng
hen rode slowly in a circle marking out
the ground that was to be kept clear for
the wrestling

  around them the promiscuous encamp-
ment gathered and they were so many
that they made a loud rustling sound
like a strong wind in the cottonwoods in
the moon of falling leaves stripped to
their breech-cloths kitsipon and ingrona
came into the center of the ring and
came to a stand facing each other across
the width of a scarlet blanket that had been
spread on the ground their bodies had
been freshly rubbed with bears grease
but they wore no paint for from his
high seat in the arch of the sky wankan
tanka looks into the hearts of his children
when they ask for judgement and there
is no medicine to make him blind

as the sun came out of the earth
the tomtoms began to throb and
the medicine men shook their rattles of
buffalo dewclaws then they dashed into
the centre of the ring and stamped around
the two contestants chanting the tradi-
tional song of invocation the drums
stopped the medicine men retired and
all eyes came to focus on the two young
men facing each other men whispered
together debating the quality of the pair

  of the same height narrow-hipped
deep of chest and broad of shoulder to
the eye they seemed to be evenly matched
a quiver of excitement ran through the
people and the murmur of their voices
rose like a wind as wagers were made-a
blanket against two blankets a pony
against two ponies the odds were against
kitsipon because he had no eagle feather
to adorn his hair

  then sounding sky stepped out into
the sunlight and clamor the voices of
men women and children blended in a

stories

shout of acclaim

  hie-yah-h-h-ha

  the war-chief lifted his feathered staff
for silence not yet an old man he made
a splendid figure in full ceremonial dress
his buckskin shirt was fringed with
human hair and the tail feathers of his
war-bonnet brushed the ground without
visible effort he spoke in a deep powerful
voice that carried far over the heads of
the people and seemed to come from
above always he spoke wisely and the
people loved to listen to him

  my brothers the chiefs voice rang
out at this holy time the dakota purify
their hearts at this season the young
ones do as they please the mother does
not scold the father does not strike the
laggard son with his bow because there
must be no anger in our hearts at this
holy time he paused and the medicine
men chanted in choruses

  it is so it is so indeed then as
silence came again sounding sky went
on

  yonder you see a blanket between two
of our young men it is there because they
would have shed blood not in sacrifice as
is meet at this holy time but in enmity
let it be known everywhere that they want
the same woman let it be known every-
where that their hearts are bad because of
this it is a bad thing my brothers it 
a trouble upon all of us the sun dance
cannot go forward until this thing is
settled

  while you slept the scalp shirt men
talked of this thing now you dakota i
speak for your chiefs let the young men
fight until one can fight no more to the
woman daybreak star i say this the
daughters of the dakota are free to chose
their own men but this i say to her also
wankan tanka will show her which is
the better man i have spoken

  a great shout went up from the people
and quickly died as sounding sky raised
his staff and let it fall to his side at
the signal one of the horsemen dug his
heels into the belly of his pony he dashed
across the ring swooped down to pick up
the blanket came up whirling it about his
head and gae tongue to the dakota war-
cry

  hie-yah-h-h-h-yeep yeep

  the dust he had kicked up in his passing
moccasined death



was still rising- when kitsipon and ingrona
sprang at each other they came together
chest to chest with legs and arms wide-
spread hands locked palm to palm as a
clean trial of strength it was beautiful to
watch their powerful thigh and back
muscles knotted strained and quivered
but not an inch of ground was yielded and
ingrona knew that he had met his equal
that he could not win by strength alone

   they broke and circled as light-footed
as a pair of catamounts then suddenly
kitsipon rushed in and wound his arms
around ingronas waist the people shouted
as they saw the shamans son lifted
shoulder high but ingronas body writhed
and twisted like a snake and kitsipon
could not retain his hold long enough to
complete the throw

  they broke and circled again near
defeat had shaken ingronas nerve his
mouth was ugly his throat snarling then
suddenly he bounded forward and kicked
kitsipon in the groin as kitsipon doubled
lip and rolled on the ground in agony the
women scolded ingrona shrilly

  in such a contest as this no hold or
blow was banned but in the proud hearts
of the dakota there was no place for the
man who stooped to win by a mean blow
or trick the young men of the ogala and
other clans cried out shame and the
hunkpapa braves feeling the sting of it
jeered ingrona and shouted at kitsipon
akakimat akakimat stay with it up
kitsipon-up 

ingrona advanced upon them shout-
ing and gesticulating claiming that his
man was down the fight won but the
more he protested the louder they jeered
him then a great shout went up as kit-
sipon got to his feet his face twisted with
pain the partiality of the people infuriated
ingrona and with a chocking cry he
rushed at kitsipon crouching kitsipon
met his charge and in the next moment
ingrona went flying over his shoulder to
fall with a sickening thud

  good good roared the braves up
ingrona stay with it

   but ingrona did not move in the sudden
tense silence that followed kitsipon felt a
cold chill run down his spine the women
were staring at the still form with their
hands held over their mouths then some-

one shouted

  he is dead the people came surging
from all sides of the ring only to be
pushed back by the camp-police who came
riding to clear a path for sounding sky
and the medicine men

  for a long time ingrona was like a
man dead when at last he sat up groaning
it was seen that his right arm was broken
the bone sticking out through the torn and
bloody muscles of his forearm long
ghost the shaman gaunt and hollow-
cheeked got up from his knees and turned
blazing eyes upon kitsipon

  you have done a bad thing he said
there will be trouble about this thing
when my son is well he will settle this
thing

  always you chatter like crow in the
summer time sounding skys deep voice
interposed like crow there is nothing
in your head if your heart is bad it will
le good for you to leave camp

  long ghosts black eyes narrowed to
slits and he would have made answer but
for the grunts of approval that sounded all
around him by fraud and trickery he
had gained much influence among the
hunkpapa and he was too crafty to be
drawn into an open quarrel with sounding
sky the head chief raised his voice
this thing is finished it will be good
for all to forget about it

  as the crowd broke up into small
groups two of the camp-police lifted
ingrona to carry him to his fathers lodge
sounding sky said to long ghost

  i will send pawnee captive to your
lodge she knows much she will give
your son strong medicine he will soon be
well

  long ghost only grunted and strode
away

  the day was very hot and watinyan
god of thunder growled like a bear be-
hind the hills before all the people could
gain the shelter of their lodges a sudden
storm burst upon the camp with a start-
ling display of lightning rain swept across
the open prairie the angry roar of
watinyan was in the wind and the beat-
ing of his wings flattened many tipis the
people drew their blankets over their
heads and children clung together to
withstand the fury of his passing

  just before sunset the sky cleared the


indian stories

smell of the prairies was sweet after the
rain the voice of the meadow-lark trilled
and the women laughed and chattered as
they repaired the damage done to the camp
kitsipon was eating with his father and
mother when he heard the camp-crier call-
ing his name through the camp

  the braves of the horn society ask
kitsipon to visit them tonight he
shouted the horn men ask kitsipon to
drink paezhuta sapa the black coffee medi-
cine with them

  thunder face grunted and looked at
his son with a gleam of pride in his eyes
the horn society of the blackfeet was
the most famous among the dakota a
great honor indeed for a young man who
had no wounds to show to be invited to
drink paezhuta sapa with them

  my son he said you are no longer a
boy they will ask you to join a war-party
i think

  kitsipons heart grew big soon he
would have an eagles feather perhaps two
like ingrona he felt good and he thought
kindly of ingrona sick in his fathers
lodge he said i will give ingrona my
best pony my new leggins and deerskin
shirt these i will give him also

  hank-ha protested his mother i
made them as soft as the down of a bird
give him something else my son

  he must give like the son of a chief
the father reproved her it is good old
woman the people will know that there
is no evil in his heart

  some time later kitsipon came to a
stand before the open lodge of long
ghost ingrona lay on liis skin bed at the
back of the tipi his mother and pawnee
captive were seated before the fire

  i bring this pony and these deerskins
said kitsipon to show that there is no
anger in my heart

  my son sleeps the mother answered
without looking up he does not want
your horse

 wake him woman said kitsipon
firmly i will make talk with him

  the mothers eyes met his in a wide
dark stare then she looked at pawnee
captive and pawnee captive answ-ered
for her

  my medicine is strong he will not
wake until the sun rises again

  whenever kitsipon looked into the dark

handsome face of pawnee captive he got
a queer feeling in the pit of his stomach
she was the woman of one arrow an
ogala brave who had captured her in a
raid many moons ago she could do things
that the dakota women could not do she
carried her babe in a basket woven of
grass she made cooking pots of water
and earth and brewed strong medicine
in them people looked askance at her
and many said that she was a witch kit-
sipon was sure of it under her steady
gaze he had the feeling that she was look-
ing clean through him he shifted his
position uneasily

  i will leave the pony and the deer-
skins he said and moved off with haste

ill

as he crossed the campus head-
ing for the skin-covered tipis of the
blackfeet a scout came riding furiously
into the camp from the hills and shouting
at his voice sapos sapos he flung
himself from his sweating pony nd ran
into sounding skys lodge

  sapos sapos his cry echoed by
many tongues and in a moment the whole
camp wras seething with excitement as
the people came running from all direct-
ions and the camp-crier went galloping
from clan to clan calling the scalp shirt
men to council the tremolo of the women
filled the camp as the braves gathered
outside the big council lodge silent but
with eyes aglow in anticipation of battle
kitsipon stood among them his heart beat-
ing high for it was soon known that the
scout had come upon the trace of crows
skulking in the hills would his father let
him ride with the war-party this was the
only thought in kitsipons head

  he was not kept in doubt long sound-
ing sky came out of the lodge followed
by the six scalp shirt men a great shout
went up as the head chief lifted his
feathered staff high above his head kit-
sipons eyes sought his fathers silently
pleading the old man inclined his head
and smiled to see his son whirl and dash
across the campus as light as smoke

  all the young braves were eager to
strike the crow the traditional foe but
none so eager as kitsipon this was his
day tonight he would bring a crow
moccasined death



scalp to the lodge of the horn society
or never set foot in another snow in
the wild dash for the horses he was among
the first who flung themselves upon their
ponies

  just as the sun touched the rim of the
hills the dakota braves paraded around
the camp twice they circled it then
sounding sky lifted his war-lance and
with a long-drawn hie-yah-h-h-h-yeep
yeep the panthers of the plains dashed
out of the camp

  they rode pell-mell in a cloud of dust
but as they neared the hills the mass
broke up into small parties to scour the
hills for sign of the enemy kitsipon
streaked away to the south in his party
were white dog a renowned hunkpapa
brave crow shoe and thunder horn at
the sound of hoof geats behind kitsipon
looked back and was surprised to see
long ghost riding hard to catch up with
them soon the shaman was riding be-
side him

  they moved down into the ravines and
up the hills they rode hard without sign of
the enemy until darkness overtook them on
the bank of a creek that came spilling out
of a ravine here thunder horn their
leader decided to camp for the night

  kitsipon and his companions planted
poles of willow shoots in the ground in a
circle covering them with saddle blankets
all around in the centre of this wind-
break they built their fire they ate a
meal of pemmican in silence and then
long ghost brewed some paezhuta sapa
for which he had traded with the black-
feet he said when the others had drunk
he refilled the horn and passed it to kit-
sipon and said

  my son accepts your gifts let there
be no evil between us

  that is good friend said kitspon
and drank and smacked his lips over the
strong aromatic liquid

  because he was the youngest he was
given the first watch and because this
was his first war-party and he was anxious
to show his keeness he was not content
to sit by the fire and keep his eyes and
ears open while his companions slept but
went out to prowl around the windbreak
like a wolf

  the moon was caught between two
threatening clouds and it was very dark

the hobbled horses were moving about
with short jumps as they grazed oc-
casionally one of them sneezed and he
started and tightened his grip of the stock
of his flintlock a barred owl sent his
booming note into the night from a near-
by tree and another answered him from
the creek

  he came to a stand in the darkness a
queer sick feeling had come into his
stomach he felt that he would like to sit
down for a while the quiet of the camp
and the sighing of the wind gave rise to
a strange feeling of goneness that seemed
suddenly to flood his body he began to
shiver and drew his blanket tightly about
him through a slit in the windbreak he
could see the glow of the fire and it grew
larger then smaller and then faded into a
mist this frightened him he thought
that he was about to fall asleep he started
to get up and then fell on his face

  he awoke to all the sudden blackness of
the night with shouts and shots ringing in
his ears he started to his feet only to
fall back groaning as the earth seemed
to lift under his feet and turn up side
down then someone threw water into
his face and he sat up to stare stupidly
into the furious eyes of thunder horn

  up woman the leader shouted at him
and kicked him in the ribs as long ghost
and crow shoe came up to scowl down at
him

  the crow have stolen our horses
thunder horn raved white dog ran
after them and they killed him do you
hear nastinchala

  kitsipon winced at the insult he got
to his feet and stood swaying thunder
horns face blurred and became two faces
distorted with rage

  no man calls me rabbit woman kit-
sipon muttered

  thunder horn spat at him and then
struck him a hard blow in the face kit-
sipons legs would not support his weight
he sat down and everything whirled
around him

hunder horn was working him-
self up into a frenzy i am a great
warrior he fumed but this woman
has disgraced me he has disgraced us
all my brothers what will the people
say about this thing the ogala will mock


indian stories

us the blackfeet will mock us they
will ask who are these braves who went
on the warpath and came back walking
they will tell it everywhere he choked
in his rage and drew his knife

  and he would have plunged it into
kitsipons heart then and there if long
ghost had not pushed him back

  the shaman said firmly there is no
thinking in you thunder horn we take
him back to camp the scalp shirt men
will talk of this thing if we do this no
one will blame us i think

  he speaks good words brother said
crow shoe

  thunder horn sheathed his knife and
uttered a grunt of assent then with
long ghost to help him he jerked kit-
sipon to his feet without waiting for day-
light they set out for the camp

  kitsipon sat in his fathers lodge
hunched up in his blanket and his heart
was like a cold stone in his breast his
head was clear now he knew that he
had disgraced himself his father and
his people how or why this thing had
happened to him he could not tell it
had happened and his spirit was dead
within him when his mother spoke to him
he looked at her with the blank stare of a
blind man and made no answer and when
the camp-crier came to call him to the
council of the scalp shirt men he obeyed
the summons like a sleep-walker

  the people had all gathered before the
council lodge from which the covering had
been rolled back so that the chiefs and the
medicine men sat within a covered half-
circle in plain view of all a way was
opened for kitsipon he heard voices but
they were like whispering he saw faces
but they were like shadows as he came to
a stand long ghost rose to speak his
hand came from under his blanket and
his finger pointed at the hunkpapa chief
and there was venom in his look

  my brothers he said all the chiefs
have spoken about this thing but thunder
face is silent he sits like rabbit like
rabbit he says nothing

  he sat down and the hunkpapa chief
rose my brothers the old man said in
a voice that shook i am old like old
horse that stands in the shade i stand in
the shadow of this thing like old horse
my head is low my son stands in the

shadow of this thing also but he is not old
i ask him to lift his head and hear the
judgment of the scalp shirt men

  kitsipons head came up with a jerk
he answered clearly and firmly th re
is no fear in my heart my father it is
too cold to know fear i-

  ho the voice of long ghost in-
terrupted him ho listen to nastinchala
listen to the rabbit- he stopped talk-
ing as sounding sky jumped to his feet

  always you chatter like crow ex-
claimed the chief our hearts are sore
because of this thing- that has come upon
our brother but there is no sorrow in
your heart i think he raised his voice so
that all the people could hear

  i speak for your chiefs this trouble
has come upon our brother thunder
face because his son drew a knife to
shed the blood of one of his own people at
this holy time we think it will be well
for kitsipon to leave this camp lest the
anger of wankan tanka fall upon all of
us the scalp shirt men put this ban
upon kitsipon let him leave the camp
now let him not return to his people un-
til twelve moons have passed let no man
give him food of comfort while this ban is
upon him i have spoken

  a few hours later kitsipon rode toward
the hills he was riding his pack-horse
and leading his fathers war-horse flying
hawk the great steel-dust stallion had
been his fathers parting gift and there
was not a faster horse among the dakota
his saddle he had made himself and on
it he carried some pemmican a horn cup
and a war-ag containing his dress cloths
he had a four-point norvest blanket
and a buffalo robe strapped to the cantle
in his belt on his left side he carried his
knife in a sheath his other weapons con-
sisted of his flintlock and his quiver con-
taining his bow and thirty arrows with
metal war-heads that he had made from
an old frying pan

  he rode into the hills he did not look
back at the camp but kept going steadily
that was the easiest thing to do because
he didnt know where to go at the back
of his mind there was the idea that the
crows were responsible for his disgrace
and banishment and that he would avenge
himself by hunting crow scalps he must
prove his manhood to himself first then he
moccasised death



would do a great thing- a brave deed
that would be talked of everwhere oh
yes he would come back to his people a
great warrior he would throw many crow
scalps at the feet of sounding sky then
daybreak stars eyes would shine like the
stars again for him

iv

for many days he wandered in
the hills like the gray wolf he lurked
on the flanks of the moving crow villages
like a wolf he ran down the lone hunter
but he scorned to spring upon his quarry
from ambush he challenged all to battle
and no brave he encountered withstood
him for long for he fought with the fury
of the wounded mountain-lion

  by the time the cherries were black
there were six crow scalps dangling from
the barrel of his flintlock sometimes the
crows sent out war-parties to chase him
but always the steel-dust stallion outran
their fastest ponies often they saw him
at night on a butte silhouetted against the
moon the long mane and tail of his
horse flowing like water under the stars
and the steel-blue color of the great stal-
lion blended so completely with the star-
lit night that it gave him a ghostly aspect

  soon the crows came to thinking that
he was an evil spirit haunting the hills
and the plains and they called him ghost
horse they feared him greatly and when
his long-drawn war-cry came echoing down
from a butte the crow braves looked down
at the ground and dared not answer it

  in the moon of falling leaves kitsipon
left the crow country he followed the
honking geese southward for soon the
howl of the wolf would echo over the
white world of winter and he knew that
he must find some place to winter he had
used up all his powder and must find a
friendly band with whom he could trade
his pelts for more

  besides he was lonely and sick at heart
at night his father and mother spoke to
him in dreams even when awake these
same images appeared to him and super-
imposed themselves on his surroundings
veiling them creating a perpetual mirage
in the babbling of a creek he heard the
laughter of children around the cooking
fires the soft eyes of the deer that fell to his

swift arrows reminded him of daybreak
star and then he felt so bad that a tight-
ness came into his stomach and he could
not eat the flesh

  day after day he rode talking to flying
hawk his horse he was sure that the
stallion understood him because he attri-
buted understanding to all creatures and
if he could not understand their speech it
was only because the power lay dormant
he understood them well enough in
dreams

  once he crossed the trail of an indian
village and he knew it was one of the
dakota clans moving south to winter camp
which of the seven clans that had
gathered for the sun dance he could not
tell for sure but he thought it was sound-
ing skys village because it was a big
village-much bigger that the hunkpapa
and the other clans would be far to the
north and east by this time

  he followed the trail until it led him
out of the wooded foothills and drew
rein on a high butte the plain was like a
colored blanket dropped from the sky
and tumbleweed rolled along the ground in
ungainly bounds as far as eye could see
nothing else moved it was hard not to
follow the trail until he saw the camp
but wankan tanka saw all things and
to atone for his disgrace he must not
seek out or look upon the face of one of
his own people for many moons yet
slowly he rode back into the hills

  that evening when he was making his
way dowrn a draw to his camp site a
wolf came out of the bush and howled at
him it was a huge black timber wolf
and with the true curiosity of a wolf it
watched kitsipon notch an arrow but at
the twang of the sinew-lacked bow it
jumped sideways the arrow missed its
shoulder and gouged its flank and with a
yelp it vanished into the bush

  go now my brother said kitsipon
tomorrow i will follow you i need
your thick fur for the winter
accordingly at daybreak he loaded his pelts
on the pack-horse and rode out on the trail
of the big wolf it was easy to follow be-
cause it left a track of blood it led him
far over the hills and into a valley it
seemed to be bent on a steady trail due
south not even the fresh cross tracks of
deer swerved it form its purposeful course
	indian

this puzzled kitsipon because the wolf
was not acting like a hunted thing

  he was a pitiless hunter and he kept
on tirelessly he knew that the wolf was
tiring and that if it kept to open country
he would soon run it down but the
shadows of the trees were long when sud-
denly he saw the wolf on a naked ridge

  ho ho my brother shouted kitsipon
you are tired now but you are a brave
warrior you will stand and fight now

leaving the pack-horse he galloped
up the steep slope but when he got
to the top he could see no sign of the
wolf there was no trace of it it had
vanished like smoke slowly he began to
circle the spot where he had seen it last
looking for a trace of blood then his
ear keenly tuned to the voices of the
woods caught a strange sound he dis-
mounted and stood listening intently
faintly on the wind the sound came again
he uttered a grunt of astonishment there
was no mistaking what it was it was the
wail of a child

  he jogged down the hill toward a clump
of dense bush and trees whence the sound
had come then he saw a red blanket
staked up in a hollow in the bush to form
a crude shelter under the blanket an
indian woman lay face down on a buffalo
robe she did not stir as he approached
he dropped to his knees and rolled her
over and then jumped to his feet as if
something had stung him it was one
arrows woman pawnee captive

  she was still breathing but her skin was
drawn tightly over her cheek bones she
groaned as he bent over her again hunger
looked at him from out of her glazed eyes
her lips moved but no sound came then
he heard the wail again it seemed to come
from above he looked up and there hang-
ing high out of reach of prowling animals
he found the child-a baby not more than
two years old snug in its woven basket
packed with rabbit skins

  swiftly he built a big fire and made a
camp then he snared a rabbit and slit-
ing its throat with his knife pressed the
warm blood into the mouth of the hungry
infant then he did the same for pawnee
captive later he roasted meat on the
end of a stick and fed it to the woman
she ate sparingly with her strange eyes

stories

fastened on his face then she asked for
the child he put it into her arms and
without another word she drew her
blanket around it and sank into a deep
sleep

  while she slept he built a large shelter
of saplings and covered it with skins as
he worked he thought about the big wolf
and its unswerving track leading straight
to pawnee captive and her child there
was no doubt in his mind as to what had
happened near death pawnee captive
had sent her spirit forth in the shape of
the wolf to bring help and he cast uneasy
glances at the sleeping woman once he
thought it would be well to leave all his
food with her and ride away but curiosity
got the better of his fears

  two days passed before pawnee cap-
tive was able or willing to utter more than
grunts but on the third day when he came
back from a long hunt it was to find his
meal ready for him while he was eating
pawnee captive suddenly burst into
speech

  my man one arrow is dead a big
war-party of crows attacked our camp
many ogala braves were killed it was a
big fight many crows died also it was
enough for them they went away but
they took our horses sounding sky led
the people south to capture more horses
we saw no buffalo and soon the kettles
were empty i could not keep up i came
here to die

  kitsipon scowled it is not the way of
the dakota to leave their women to
starve

  i am pawnee she answered quietly
many say i am evil woman a witch
kitsipon said nothing after a long
pause she went on again

  a thing troubles my mind for two
days i have kept this thing in my mind
because it is a bad thing now i want to
tell you about this thing

  how grunted kitsipon

  this thing will make your heart
heavy but it is so after the crow raid
sounding sky sent scouts to look for your
people to call them to council they came
but your fathers voice was not heard in
the council of the scalp shirt men the
shaman long ghost sat in his place now
the hunkpapa have no ears for the words
of thunder face they have ears only
moccasined death	

for the words of long ghost

  nothing of what he felt showed on
kitsipons stern young face he stated
rather than asked sounding sky will go
on the warpath against the crows

  it is so

  ho that is good the crows know
me then he looked at pawnee captive
and asked can you travel woman

  i am ready she answered then in-
gronas arm is crooked she told him
long ghosts heart turned bad toward
your father because of this now there is
another thing in my heart that i do not
speak but a time will come when i will
show kitsipon this thing that is in my
heart

in the morning he made a travois
for the child and they traveled slowly
back through the valley on the following
day they came to the spot where kitsipon
had seen the trace of the ogala village
and for two days they followed the trail
across the swale and roll of the plains
all the way they watched closely for war-
parties but saw nothing but the slinking
coyote and the prairie-chickens that flut-
tered cackling across their path and once
in the distance a cloud of dust that
marked the passing of a herd of buffalo

  on the fourth day they saw red hills
against the skyline low and bare later
they could see a line of trees that bordered
a river-a dark green blur lying on the
brown of the prairie like a snake above
the trees turky-vultures wheeled and be-
cause they did not settle kitsipon knew
that they were hovering over the refuse
of an indian camp

  as they drew nearer he remembered
these hills once long ago the hunkpapa
load wintered here in a deep valley beyond
the river carry-the-kettle-camp the
women had called it because it was three
buffalo arrows from the water when he
could see the blue smoke-haze of the
lodge fires he hauled up and said to paw-
nee captive

  i go no further because of the ban that
is on me

  pawnee captive slid from the pack-
horse took her child from the travois
and shouldered the cradle then she came
to stand before kitsipon very straight
and very handsome and there was a soft

light in her jet black eyes

  where will you go

  kitsipon pointed to a spot far up the
river i camp there tonight he told her
i have helped you now you must help
me i will wait until i hear the war drum
then i will ride and leave a trail easy to
follow my trail will lead to the crow
camp tell my father of this thing but
speak of it to  other man

  pawnee captive laughed softly i see
what is in your mind she said if a
spirit came to your father in a dream and
showed him the road to the crow camp
the people would think that his medicine
is strong

  kitsipon said sternly that is not in
my mind woman

  no matter said she with a faint
smile your father will have a dream
when i go to his lodge i will give him
black-coffee-medicine oh yes he will have
a dream

  kitsipon started struck by a sudden
thought black-coffee-medicine he said
scowling does it make a man sleep
woman 

  it will do no harm she said then
added quickly there is another i will
speak to i will speak to her with a
womans heart she will wait until kit-
sipon comes back to his people i think
if she wants a man bom to be a chief
she will wait with that she set her face
toward the river leaving kitsipon to stare
after her

  he watched until she faded into the
gloom of the trees thinking that one day
he must have plain speech with her learn
about this black-coffee-medicine that made
a man sleep and dream then he rode up
the river and made camp in a sandy hol-
low screened by cottonwoods and willows

  it was sometime in the dead of that
night that he awoke startled by the howl
of a wolf coming from the opposite bank
the moon had climbed out of the earth
and seemed to be entangled in the
branches of the cottonwoods back in the
hills he could hear the subdued beat of a
medicine drum flying hawk snorted and
stamped as the wolf howled again very
close to his camp he got up and stood
with the hair pricking his scalp half ex-
pecting to see the flint-eyes of the big
timber wolf glaring at him from across


indian stories

the river

  the moon struggled out of the cotton-
woods he moved to the stallion stroking
his silken neck soothing him across the
river he thought he saw a black shape
slink across an open space then flying
hawk jerked up his head and looked in-
tently upstream ears forward kitsipon
looked in the direction indicated

  a long file of indians was moving
silently downstream they rode with their
blankets up to their eyes so that only their
eagles feathers showed the feathers
were red it was a big crow war-party

v

he backed flying hawk into the
deep shadows and pinched his
nostrils to keep him from whinnying it
was a large party for it took a long time
for the file to pass his place of conceal-
ment the strength of the party told him
at once that it was bent on the destruction
of the ogala and hunkpapa before sound-
ing sky could summon the rest of the
dakota clans as the last of the braves
melted into the shadows he patted the
stallions neck and said

  ho ho this is bad for our people
friend they will not think that the crows
have followed them so far south it is
good that we saw this thing

  the moon went behind a cloud and it
grew darker but in his mind he carried
a clear picture of the country-the hill-
side flowing down to the river the thicket
on his left hand that looked like the stiff
hair on an angry dogs back he swung
onto flying hawks back swam the river
then circled the hill in the opposite direct-
ion to that taken by the crow war-party

  he rode slowly and silently for he knew
that the crows would not attack the camp
until an hour before dawn when sleep is
deepest soon he found the path the wo-
men had made down to the water and
followed it the throbbing of tomtoms
grew louder presently he saw the flick-
ering light of a big fire in the valley a
dance was in progress and most of the
people were gathered in the centre of the
camp he rode quietly in no man chal-
lenged him the crows might have done
the same he thought he spoke to flying
hawk

ho we will teach them my friend
then he touched the stallions belly
with his heels and thundered into the
camp straight down upon the dancers
he bore shouting at the top of his voice
sapos sapos

  in a moment panic swept through the
camp like fire in the prairie grass men
raced for their weapons women caught
up their children and ran shrieking on
the heels of their men sounding skys
voice rang out above the tumult kitsipon
saw him standing among a group of elders
and medicine men with his staff held
above his head to rally the ogala and
hunkpapa around him he pulled flying
hawk down to the haunches wheeled
bounded from the saddle and strode up
to the chief

  a chorus of exclamations broke out as
he approached the group he saw long
ghosts gaunt figure bathed in the flick-
ering light of the big fire the shaman
wore the buckskin shirt of a chief deco-
rated with tassles of human hair his
eyes swept over the group but he could
not see his fathers face

  how he said and came to stand
before the chief

  sounding sky did not return his greet-
ing instead he lifted his hand touched
his lips then his heart and flipped his
fingers twice at kitsipon and that said
as plainly as words there is a ban upon
you stand away from me

  kitsipon felt the hot blood rush up
into his ears his eyes flashed and he
said war-chief while you dance the
crows creep up upon your camp i came
to tell you this thing now you know it
do as you will

  he lies long ghosts voice accused
we are far from crow country he has
seen no crows he lies his heart it not
strong enough to live out the ban-
enough sounding sky raised his
hand in a dignified gesture the braves
who had dashed for their weapons were
now coming back on the run to form a
tight circle around the fire sounding sky
waited for the commotion to die around
him as silence came he said my bro-
thers we have eyes and ears let the
auhuminea go out to find the crow camp
there was a rustle of movement as the
camp-police detached themselves from the
moccasined death



group and vanished into the night

  now said sounding sky let kitsi-
pon speak

  kitsipon drew himself up proudly and
told how the timber wolf had led him
to pawnee captive and her child and how
the wolf had wakened him so that he
might see the crow war-party as he
finished one of the scouts came dashing
up to report that the crow camp had
been found down by the river a tense
silence fell upon the people and all eyes
were turned upon sounding sky for a
long time the war-chief stood with folded
arms and bent head at last he spoke
brothers this is my counsel he
turned to face the river and lifted both
arms holding them crooked as if to grap-
ple with the enemy let the old men
women andchildren leave the camp then
let the ogala hide in the woods on my
right hand and let the hunkpapa hide in
the woods on my left hand when the
crows come they will think that we are
asleep in our lodges they will rush into
the camp to kill us then- he paused
looking around at the tense faces of his
braves then brought his hands together
with a resounding clap then my bro-
thers we will catch them

  agh agh-good very good shout
of approval broke out all around him
again kitsipon looked for his fathers
face among the hunkpapa braves who
had gathered around long ghost but he
could not find it his gaze came to
focus on long ghost their eyes met
and the shamans look was like the glinc
of a knife blade in the moonlight

swiftly the camp-police executed his
orders the old men women and chil-
dren were herded together then kitsi-
pon saw his father moving off with the
old men the shame of it struck at him
like fangs his eyes darted to long
ghost who was leading the hunkpapa
braves to the left side of the valley it
was his fathers right to lead the hunk-
papa and he saw the shaman through
a red haze of sudden hate his hand
flew to the hilt of his knife but even
as his leg muscles tightened for a spring
the hand of sounding sky fell upon his
shoulder and spun him around

  now is not the time said the chief

  kitsipon threw off his hand his eyes
blazing hot words rose shaped in his
mind but he did not utter them sound-
ing skys gaze was calm serene the
chief said in a low voice that soothed
my heart is sore for my brother
thunder face long ghost has much
mouth but poor counsel yet it is for the
hunkpapa to say who they will send to
the council of the scalp shirt men it
is the way of the dakota has the son
of thunder face forgotten this

  in my anger i forgot it said kitsi-
pon but my anger is dead now

  the chief lowered his voice now
i will tell you this pawnee captive came
to my lodge and told me a thing that
troubles my mind i do not know about
this thing but long ghost knows about
it in council i will ask him about this
thing more i cannot tell now he looked
up at the stars then

  the crows will come soon let kitsi-
pon fight with the ogala so that he
will have no trouble with long ghost
and with that he turned away and went
to join his braves already in ambush
on the wooded slope

  time passed very slowly and it seemed
to kitsipon that he had been crouched
beside sounding sky for many hours and
there was still no sign of the crow the
dakotas horses had been left to graze
the better to deceive the enemy and he
wandered if the crows would know fly-
ing hawk when they ran them off all
around him the ogala braves lay on
their bellies stripped to their breech-
cloths their painted bodies covering the
metal of their guns the night was still
except for the spirited chirping of a tree
frog the big fire in the center of the
camp blinked like a sleepy red eye and
grew smaller and smaller the moon sank
behind the hills the stars paled

  then suddenly a larred owl sent its
booming note into the night and was an-
swered by another like an echo there
was a rustle of movement in the bush
all around kitsipon as the ogala braves
rose to a crouching position the owl
hooted again and then the shrill crow
war-cry reverberated through the valley

  like wolves upon a fallen deer they
swooped into the camp they came on
foot howling and shooting their guns into


indian

stories

the dakota tipis then slashed their way
into them with their knives expecting to
surprise and kill the occupants before they
could grasp their weapons

  it did not take them long to discover
that they had been tricked and they came
rushing out of the tipis to gather around
their chief yapping like dogs around an
old woman with meat before they had
time to recover from the shock of it
sounding sky gave tongue to the dakota
war-cry

  hie-yah-h-h-h-veep veep

  this was the signal to shoot the black-
ness on both sides of the crows was
rent by gun-flashes as the echoes of the
ragged volley went rolling up the valley
the dakota threw down their guns
snatched tomahawk and knife from their
belts and rushed down upon the con-
fused crows the long-drawn war-cry
trailing behind them

  in a moment kitsipon found himself
among the crows cutting and slashing
two braves went down before him then
a blow from a gun butt stunned him
he dropped to his knees and the fight
surged over and all around him

  when he struggled to his feet he saw
that these crows were not women many of
them had fallen to the dakotas guns and
many more had been slashed to death in the
first savage attack but they had beaten off
the attack and now they were gathered
around their chief chanting their death
songs prepared to die with their faces to
the enemy they were outnumbered and
hemmed in on all sides but they had
their guns and even as kitsipon looked
around for sounding sky they started to
shoot a brave standing close to kitsipon
coughed and fell on his face

under the menace of their guns the
dakota wavered many thought of
their own guns which they had dropped
in the bush and ran to get them this
thinned the circle about the trapped
crows and their chief was quick to see
the chance this gave them to break
through to their horses

  sapos-hokdu hoka his voice rang
out above the thudding of the guns and
in the next minute he came bounding
straight at kitsipon and the crows came
howling on his heels the suddeness of

the onslaught took the dakotas by sur-
prise they broke to right and left and
kitsipon found himself alone standing
in the path of the crow chief he stood
his ground-he had never shown his back
to a crow

  like a mountain-lion the crow chief
came at him swinging his tomahawk kit-
sipon ducked the stroke and sank his
knife into the crows body and then
they went down together locked in a
death struggle rolling over and over on
the ground while the crow charge swept
over them

  the crow chief was strong and he
fought like a wounded wolverine but
his strength was fast ebbing from his
wound he gasped as kitsipons knife
found his body again bravely he strug-
gled to his knees and died as kitsipons
knife plunged into his throat deftly kit-
sipon took his scalp

  when he got to his feet there was not
a man in sight but far down the valley
he could hear the dakotas howling like
a wolf pack on the heels of the fleeing
crows he started to run then a gun
shot came so close that the flash blinded
him and the bullet grazing his left shoul-
der spun him around and dropped him
to his knees before he could regain his
feet long ghost came leaping from be-
hind a tipi the shaman swung his gun
above his head kitsipon flung himself
sideways the gun butt thudded on the
ground close to his head he bounded to
his feet and kicked the gun from the
shamans hands

  long ghost backed away slowly his
face distorted by fear and hate his small
glinting eyes reminded kitsipon of the
horned desert snake that strikes without
coiling and suddenly he thought of the
black-medicine-coffee hed drunk on his
first war-party and knew what had made
him sleep

  he leaped forward and plunged his
knife into the shamans left breast long
ghost gasped once and died

  down by the river the crows made
their last stand and there they died
like men-all but a boy who was spared
and sent back to his people to tell the
story of the fight many of the ogala
and hunkpapa braves had gone on the
long ride also and soon the voice of
moccasined death	

miteywin was sobbing across the prairie

  but the mourning was not long for
there were many crow scalps to ran-
som the dead wantan tanka would know
his own and the souls of the departed
would not wander over the world like
lost spirits

  on the second day the dancers washed
the paint from their bodies the women
shook the ashes from their hair and
bathed in the river and there was feast-
ing day and night the drums throbbed
in the council lodge where the sacred
bundles were hung the dakota warriors
gathered to tell the story of their deeds

  all the braves were stripped to their
breechcloths they had their war-wounds
freshly painted on their bodies a red cir-
cle for a bullet wound a red stripe for
the gash of a knife or tomahawk others
had the terrible scars of the sun dance
reproduced on their chests in bloody de-
tail there were medicine men four-fea-
ther men and war-bonnet men the bravest
of the brave

  in the centre of the circle stood kitsi-
pon his head unadorned standing there
he looked serene and calm but under his
folded arms his heart was beating fast
and proudly for his father sat on the
right hand of sounding sky and between
the war-chiefs crossed legs there was a
war-bonnet it was a beautiful thing the
work of pawnee captive and daybreak
star there was not another like it in
the camp and it was the envy of all the
dakota women

  sounding sky spoke our ears are
open brothers let kitsipon the son of
the hunkpapa chief tell his story now

  like all indians kitsipon knew how
to tell a good story and he told it
vividly and in pantomine he uttered the
death cry for every crow scalp he had
taken howled for the big black timber
wolf and wailed lustily for the child of
pawnee captive he held his audience
spellbound and whenever he paused for
breath their grunts of approval sounded

all around him

  agh agh waste waste

  when he had finished and silence came
sounding sky rose to speak

  my brothers he said you saw this
young man stand alone before the crow
charge you saw a brave man the crow
chief die but there is a thing you did
not see it was the evil in long ghosts
heart i will tell you about this thing

  i sent pawnee captive to the lodge
of long ghost when his son was hurt
i did this because i knew that she would
give him strong medicine that would
make him sleep and he would not know
pain some of pawnee captives medicine
was stolen long ghost stole the medicine
and he gave it to kitsipon when he was
out looking for crows in the black hills
it is so it is so indeed many
shouted long ghost shot at kitsipon
the women saw this

  good then it is finished my brothers
before you stands a man he will sit in
his fathers place one day i think now

i	give him this war-bonnet and i give
him his mans name-a name the crows
fear ghost horse i have spoken

  kitsipon stepped out into the sunshine
in all his glory and with the acclaim of
the dakota warriors still ringing in his
ears he saw daybreak star and pawnee
captive squatted on their heels over a
pit filled with red embers above which
was a framework of willow bows holding
pieces of meat that sizzled and dripped
he swirled his blanket about him and
walked over to them as his shadow fell
across the embers they rose the girl gave
him one thrilling look then dropped her
eyes as became a maiden but pawnee
captive looked him up and down boldly

  huh she approved very good-
very handsome then with a soft laugh
she gave the girl a push toward him
kitsipon caught the girl within the fold
of his blanket and with her arm about
his waist they walked slowly toward his
fathers lodge

the eagle of kuwahi

by c hall thompson

on came the greedy suckling pigs those white men whod do any wrong
for a tiny pebble of yellow gold with them as silent wary protectors came
the bine coats    and only ruhaya and his father tsahuni the chero-
kees fearless eagle of kuwahi were prepared for the supreme sacrifice

since that time many moons have
set many suns have risen through
the blue mists of the great smokies
and the white man has forgotten tsahuni
and his son in the valley of ocona luf-
tee the cherokees wear the white mans
clothes and their sons learn lessons in his
schools they till the soil of their farms
in the warm mountain coves under ku-
wahi peak and live at peace in their
cabins

  yet there is a day when the old war-
riors wear bright cherokee blankets they
toil up the steep paths through forests

that have not known the spoilers axe
to the crest where a tall rock stands un-
changed by a century of wind and the
great rains there is a night when they
sit by the grave of tsahuni the eagle of
kuwahi and the old men remember the
old men tell again the story of tsahuni
of his son ruhaya and the year of the
eagle

  that year a sliadow darkened the valley
and the cherokees moved silently in their
land they stood on the hills staring east
to the place of the white man uneasy
because a bright pebble liad been found


	indian

in the streams of ocona luftee a yellow
stone that white men called a nugget the
word had spread like fire in the dry grass
of october and now on the eastern rim of
the gierokee country camps had sprung
up like poisoned mushrooms strange men
with heavy faces and the tools of mining
in their packs sat by the campfires and
watched the valley and waited

  tlie white miners had not crossed the
boundary in years long gone the white
father had sent a scroll of paper and the
old chiefs had set their marks on it from
that time the canyons and ridges of the
great smokies had been the home of the
gierokee and the whites who wanted
the golden stone could only sit now and
wait and talk

  their talk moved west through the pine-
stands sighing like a cold stormwind in
the passes of ocona luftee it was said
that the old treaty had been broken and
with the cunning of the cougar white
men had tricked a handful of cherokees
into signing a new one a piece of yellow
parchment that gave this land to those who
hovered like carrion crows on the boun-
dary that said the whole cherokee na-
tion would move far away into the west
beyond the mountains

  the old men of the tribe men like tsa-
huni who had lived long in peace heard
the whispers and did not believe they
smoked by their cabin fires and nursed
the good soil of fields that would always be
theirs they said the white father would
never break his word

  but the young men listened young
braves like ruhaya saw the long columns
of soldiers ride over the border and up
through the valley they watched the
flash of sabres and the bluecoated men who
came by the thousands to build stockades
in the low meadows and the young men
felt the cold stormwind at their backs and
their mouths set thin and hard they
frowned at the rifles and cannon and the
high fort walls that could be the walls of
a prison

  ruhaya saw the coming of the final col-
umn in the afternoon of that day he had
come far from his fathers cabin high into
the reaches of kuwahi his bow strung
taut and arrows in his quiver hunting
meat for the table he had come out onto
a bench and started down following the

stories

  trace of a deer when he caught the sudden
glitter of sun on metal

  he stood very still then tall and straight
as a young tree his eyes like the eyes of
the golden eagle that nests in the crags
watching the long snake of the column
winding through the pass below

  the horsemen came first stiff in the
saddle and armed with heavy rifles they
handled their mounts with care scanning
the shadowed coves behind them rolled
the guns that spoke with the voice of
thunder and could cut down men like
cornstalks before a sickle and in the
rear the wagons that did not belong to the
army the wagons driven by men in woolen
shirts and dirty breeches and loaded with
mining tools

  ruhayas shoulders went rigid the wait-
ing is over his mind said they come now
the vultures brazenly with their army
to protect them they come to lay claim
to the land of the gierokee

  his gaze swung back to the head of the
line picked out the bright bars of the
commanding officer then narrowed at the
sight of a tall loose figure in fringed buck-
skin riding side by side with the officer

  and you gentry even you turn
against us now

  ruhayas voice held a soft final bitter-
ness he turned and started down along
the shale-scattered path to the valley

  they saw him coming they saw him
break clear of the trees at the toe of the
hill and walk straight and sure into the
open the officer reined in sharply lifted
a gloved hand a silent order ran down
the line horses halted champing at the
bit caissons grumbled to a standstill and
far back the wagon brakes squealed

  the commanding officer sat quite still
in the saddle a rifle rested across his
pommel the troopers did not move but
slowly a knot of miners on horseback rode
up to the spearhead and drew in behind
the officer

  the tall man in buckskin stepped out
of the saddle he stood there his lean
bronze face expressionless his jaw ten-
dons cord-tight

they watched as ruhaya advanced
at an even deliberate pace they
watched the wink of arrowbarbs the
fringed leggins and bright neckerchief the
the eagle of kvwahl



slide and knot of muscles in the naked
torso and the keen dark eyes that never
left them ruhaya halted a few yards from
the spearhead directly in front of the
officer

  the officer was young and sweating
his hands were restless on the gun ru-
haya saw the faces of the miners hungry
wolf faces and eyes that glittered with
the same hard light as the yellow pebbles
of the creek he heard the officers voice
raw but level

gentry ask him what he wants
the tall man in buckskin didnt speak
he watched ruhaya steadily and his
mouth worked but no sound came finally
his eyes turned away

  ruhaya looked at the young officer
say your own words captain i know
the tongue of the white man

  an uneasy mutter went down the line
the horses shifted nervously

  the miners exchanged a glance one of
them a square hog of a man with straw-
colored hair and loose sleepy eyelids edged
his roan forward abruptly ruhaya did
not step back the square-set man smiled
flicking a weighted quirt against his thigh

  flatly ewen gentry said no more of
that van tilgh

  thick hog-jowls tightened listen gen-
try im not taking orders from   

  all right van tilgh the officers
tone was too sharp more quietly he said
ill handle this

  ruhaya had not moved he stood tall
in the sun his eyes probing the officers
face the officer cleared his throat

  youre holding us up if you have any
business   

  ruhaya said evenly my people have
not asked questions perhaps they have
been silent too long his black stare
switched to gentry perhaps they have
trusted too much

  the soldiers shifted saddleleather
creaked and light caught fire on restless
gunbarrels gentry did not meet ruhayas
stare

  the young officers mouth was edged
with white

  ask your questions cherokee
ruhaya looked at him for a long time
the words came cool unhurried

  a treaty was made this was said to

-indian stories-winter

be the land of my people yet now there
is bad talk in the air we see the white
mans army ride into ocona luitee we
count him to the number of seven thou-
sand and watch while he builds forts with
high walls tsahuni my father has said
that the white man will keep his word we
will be left in peace in our land yet the
young braves watch and they wonder
van tilgh laughed thickly the quirt
slapped the palm of his hand

  it aint always good to wonder
gentrys mouth thinned but the chero-
kee ignored van tilgh

  i ask the question now he told the
officer quietly what is the meaning of
the stories why do the seven thousand
come 

  he could see sweatbeads on the pale
young face the twitching of the officers
hands he could feel the column silent
and waiting and hear the sharp smack of
van tilghs quirt against his boot

  the officer straightened in the saddle
his voice was hard to control you have
answered your own questions this is the
land of the cherokee

  ruhaya didnt blink it is not the time
to speak riddles

  the officer wet his lips im telling you
the army is here for your protection
ruhaya stared at hitn nor is it the
time for lies

  the officer sat back as if he had been
hit hard across the face

  through clamped teeth he said damn
it to hell i tell you   

  you tell me you come to shield my
people from men who would steal their
land ruhaya turned his eyes to the knot
of miners yet you bring these into our
valley by your side like greedy suckling
pigs you bring those who would do any
wrong for a pebble of gold you bring
the flesh-eating vultures   

  the quirt cut down sharply at an angle
singing in the air like the buzz of a rattler
the weighted butt ripped along ruhayas
cheek left a bluewhite welt dotted with
flecks of blood

  gentry snapped van tilgh but the
quirt lifted again and the roan wheeled
crowding into ruhaya the cherokee
caught at van tilghs thick middle his
arms closed like a metal band van tilgh
swore and brought the quirt down hard


indian stories

and then hands snagged ruhayas shoul-
ders hauling him back away from the
roan pinning his sinewed amis and harsh-
ly in his ear gentry said

  for gods sake man you aint got
a chance

  he saw it then the long tier of guns
in the hands of cavalrymen the long row
of black muzzles like eyes all trained on
his chest ruhaya quit struggling

  after a minute gentry let go ruhaya
stood there breathing hard watching the
twist of a taunting smile in the hard blond
stubble of van tilghs face one of the
miners laughed thinly the guns did not
relax the young officer sat whitelipped
holding the reins too tight

  i have answered your questions he
said are there any more

  ruhaya did not look at him black quiet
eyes fixed  gentry

  tonelessly the cherokee said there
are  more

it was quiet horses snorted skittishly
the officer stood in the stirrups and
peered down the column wheeling the
miners headed back for their wagons ru-
haya did not move neither did ewen
gen tty

  the officer said all right gentry
were ready

  the man in buckskin faced ruhaya go
ahead captain ill catch up

  the officer stared for a second un-
certain sweating then he swore and
lifted his canvas-gauntleted hand
faw-hard

  the ragged cry echoed down the line
saddlegear chinked and squealed and the
gun-carriages groaned rolling into motion
the column struck ahead slow and heavy
and implacable the big guns passed and
the wagons the group of miners on horse-
back rode by and van tilgh spat in the
dust close to ruhayas moccasin some-
body laughed the wagons pitched and
rumbled on kicking gray dust

  the two men stood alone then in the
tall late afternoon shadows of the pass
a wind stirred the owl-feather in ruhayas
black shoulder-long hair his face was cut
stone his voice sharp as the strike of a
bullet against rock

  and you too ride with the carrion
crows

  gentry did not answer dark blood
swelled his neck and his lean jaw worked

  you ruhaya said softly gentry
the white scout the hunter who was the
friend of the cherokee who ate our food
and found favor with our young maidens
and shared the goodness of our years as
a brother   

  ewen gentry said youre wrong ru-
haya

  i have seen with these eyes i have
heard with these ears

  slowly gentrys head moved from side
to side there are things no man can

change

  their eyes held a calm humorless smile
bent ruhayas lips

  for more moons than the old ones of
my tribe can remember the cherokee has
held this land like the eagle of the crags
our war parties ranged wide and far even
into the place of the whites and in the
day of aganstata the great warrior the
cherokee stood strong against any man
who came

  that day is gone

  ruhayas smile faded do not be sure

  that day is past ruhaya you cannot
dream a victory and win it with blow-
darts and arrows against rifles and can-
non

  somewhere in the hills a raven croaked
and higher still a mountain creek rustled
over the glimmering stones of its bed
there was no anger in gentrys face now
he spoke quietly in the lilting words of the
cherokee with the tongue of a friend

  hear me ruhaya there is a tide in
the land it is strong as the floodtide of
the rivers that drives everything before it
-or drowns what stays in its path a man
can build a dam but the tide is stemmed
for only a moment the water behind the
dam grows angrier and stronger in the
end the dam is destroyed so perhaps it is
wiser to go with the tide wiser to go
into a land where there are  floods and
men who want gold

  gentry drew a deep breath the choice
is yours to make ruhaya to live in a
new country and find peace for your
squaws and children or to see them die
-to drown like stupid oxen in the rising
tide

  ruhaya was silent gentry rested a hand
on the broad shoulder
the eagle

  you understand he said now you
understand

  black eyes met his unblinking ruhaya
did not answer

  finally ewen gentry turned away and
stepped up into the saddle he looked at
the cherokee ruhaya stood motionless
as a bronze statue only his eyes lived
and burned

  he saw the spurs prod deep and the
pony surge forward he saw gentry ride
away at an easy lope and far ahead the
twisting dusty ribbon of the column for
a long time he stood there watching it
move slow and inevitable driving deeper
into the heart of his land

ii

the sun was low in the pines and
red with the last warmth of day but
across the mountain meadows a cold night
wind was rising it was quiet now the
thunder of horses and caissons had gone
away and a bird trilled in the peace of the
great smokies

  ruhaya tried not to think he climbed
up through the gathering shadow of coves
and gullies heading for the small farm
of his father moving quick and lithe with
the sure foot of the cherokee mountaineer

  he passed the cabins of indians the
fires set deep in the ground built to honor
the gods of his people and never allowed
to die silent squaws stood in doorways
and silent children clung to their skirts
braves smoked in the cabin shade and only
nodded as ruhaya passed their faces
were drawn and deep-lined they stared
north to the clearing far below where the
lights of the army stockade blinked like
the eyes of a cat that lay in wait

  and the wind in the pines whispered
to ruhaya the wind cried and said bet-
ter to move with the tide better to live
in another place than to drown in the
floods of hate and greed

  ruhaya walked faster he tried not to
listen ewen gentry was wrong he told
himself this valley was his home here
he had heard the songs of his mother and
the yarns spun by old warriors at the
council fires in the fields of ocona luftee
he had danced the green corn dance and
worked with his father to see the stalks
reach high and good to the sun he had

of kuwahi	

laughed and courted the maidens who
smiled softly and wore the neckerchiefs
of young braves as a token of their favor
and in the shadow of kuwalhi peak he
had dreamed of a bride and sons and ly-
ing one day old in years and honor with
his fathers in the cherokee burying
ground

  but the wind still cried with the voice
of ewen gentry and ruhaya halted a mo-
ment in the still twilit wood he breathed
deep in the scent of pine stung his nos-
trils and the air was good in his lungs
the thought of life for his people even
in a strange land was better than the
thought of children crying by the bodies
of dead squaws and braves fallen like
trampled corn before the fire of cannon
and rifles

  he had heard men speak of the land
avest of the mountains a dry hard land
not cool and sweet as the vallies of ku-
wahi yet a land open and free to men
who would fight to make it live perhaps
the wind said perhaps fihere could be a
new life for the cherokee an end of the
flood-tide of whites who stole everything
with a smile or a crooked word-or a gun
perhaps   

  ruhaya made a raw sound in his throat
and lunged on through the tangled brush
he didnt stop until he reached the cove
of his fathers farm saw the patient re-
assuring rows of the field the lighted win-
dows and the shadow of tsahuni moving
slow and steady about the cabin ruhaya
felt a chill sweat on his back his bruised
jaw ached dully he crossed through the
quiet dusk and stood in the open door-
way

  the cabin was warm with the smell
of commeal gruel that boiled in the pot
over the fire at the tread of moccasins
tsahuni straightened still holding the
great black ladle in his hand he was
bone-thin now and a frost lay on the mane
of long hair but he was still tall and
age had not bent the broad square of his
shoulders lines of thought and laughter
scored the darjs face and his eyes were
deep with the gentle knowledge of long
years of peace yet still bright and quick
to see

  he took a step toward the door my
son   

  then the quick eyes moved to ruhayas


indian stories

cheek the old cherokees full mouth
thinned there was no other change in his
face slowly- he turned back to the fire
the cornmeal bubbled he stirred it with
patient circles of the ladle quietly he
said

  you did not cross the track of the
deer

  ruhaya didnt speak he moved into
the firelight watching his father finally
he said

  i crossed the track of the vulture

  the ladle went motionless he could
hear the old one breathing

  they brought another column in
through the pass ruhaya said many
men and more guns that make big thun-
der

  for many moons they have done so
yet these things do us no hurt

  ruhaya looked steadily at his father

  there were others this day riding
with the white warriors there were the
ones with pans and pickaxes the seekers
of gold

  the white man is strange tsahuni
said slowly he brings guns and builds
forts yet he does not touch us the seal
was made long years ago he has never
broken his bond this is our land but
as long as the white man comes in peace
we do not question his coming

  ruhaya stared at the fire his voice
was toneless

  this day i questioned him lean fin-
gers traced the ragged welt on his cheek
this day he gave an answer

  the old quick eyes went narrow an
answer 

  that the forts are a good thing ru-
haya said that the soldiers are here to
protect us his mouth-corner twisted
down yet the birds of prey sit on their
shoulders the buzzards that would steal
our valley he shook his head slowly
and even gentry rode with them

  high up in the settling dark the crow
screamed a log sagged and sparks
spurred up the chimneyj and here in
the cabin too the wind whispered with
the voice of ewen gentry

  ruhaya tried not to hear it he tried to
draw strength from the calm movements of
the old cherokee who packed shongshaga
into his long pipe now and lit it with a
twig from the hearth tsahuni smoked

  they gave you the answer my son
stubborn hope still steadied the words
always before they have said truthfully
when there was no reason to lie ru-
haya snapped when they knew of no
yellow stones in the waters of ocona luf-
tee

  the old man smoked we have done
them no hurt they will do us none
and the stories my father the whis-
pers that say they will drive us from these
hills move our people far unto the place
of the dying sun-if these stories are true 
then we stand tsauni said then
we strike back as in the days of the raven
and the wise one and we hold our
lands

  neither of them moved ruhayas face
worked black eyes probed his

  do we not my son

  and the wind cried loud in the stillness
and sweatbeads stood on ruhayas fore-
head

  do we not tsahuni said

  abruptly ruhaya turned away the
voice of his father trailed him flat and
cold

  fear was never in the blood of the
cherokee

  ruhaya wheeled back i am not afraid
the old ones eyes held level and black
he couldnt meet them

  then suddenly harsh in the cabin quiet
the tired bitter words of ewen gentry
came alive but spoken now strangely by
a cherokee by the son of an old war-
rior

  to run with the tide ruhaya was
saying to move so that our squaws and
young will live   

 the blank mask of tsahunis face
stopped him the old voice cut out like
wet rawhide

  you say you do not fear and yet 
no a vein throbbed in ruhayas
throat it it not fear it is only that i
cannot hold to dead dreams these dreams
of standing to fight-what chance do they
have against blooded horses and guns that
can kill from beyond the flight of an ar-
row no our chief sedotee will not
lie to himself he will know they are only
dreams the blind childish dreams of old
men

  tsahuni let fly with a brutal backhand
slice ruhayas head jolted to one side
the eagle of kuwahi



the force of it opened the long scar of
the quirt a thin line of blood trickled
down his jaw tsahuni stood watching it

  after a while ruhaya turned away the
corngruel steamed and bubbled in need
of stirring tsahuni did not notice

  my son he said

  ruhaya did not answer

  there will be peace the old cherokee
said gently doggedly we will stay in
the valley of our fathers

  ruhaya did not look at him

  tsahuni went back to the fire his step
was slower now tired

  the meal is cooked he said we
will eat

  ruhaya started for the door

  my son we will eat now

  ruhaya kept walking

  where do you go

  on the sill ruhaya stopped to the
cabin of the chief he said to hear the
words of sedotee and norn his brother
to ask what the cherokee will do

  their eyes locked

 the old men will answer tsahuni
said the old men will stay he said
flatly the old men do not fear
ruhaya wheeled sharply and went out

fading north for the cabin of se-
dotee without knowing why he felt
a need to hurry the crags of kuwahi
reared black above him as he cut through
the high pine stands trailing branches
raked his skin brush caught at his driv-
ing legs and somewhere in the dark of
the grove an animal whimpered ruhaya
didnt really hear it

  beyond the tall columns of trees he
could see the stockade fires far down and
northward his step quickened

  there was anger in him the brand of
his fathers fist still burned his cheek he
tried to shut out the hurt look of tsahunis
eyes he told himself it was not a time
for foolish bravery it was a time for rea-
son perhaps sedotee the chief would
be cooler of head and wiser perhaps al-
ready the gods of the sun and moon had
counciled him echoing the words of ewen
gentry pbrhaps   

  the thought snapped clean ruhaya
froze leg-muscles taut poised on wideset
feet he swung his head to one side lis-
tening not breathing the low whimper

came again nearer now tt wasnt the
cry of an animal ruhayas hand lifted to
the hunting knife at his belt

  it happened fast fingers closed on his
ankle like the jaws of a sprung beartrap
arms reached up from the dark and twis-
ted violently ruhayas knees buckled the
ground came up hard briar tore at his
chest and then a weight was on him naked
sinew and muscle driving him back against
the earth

  his clawed hand found a shoulder the
skin was hot and sticky to the touch a
fist drove for his head ruhaya caught the
wrist and wrenched sideward the shadow
above him screamed out of pain and rolled
clear ruhaya was on top then the knife
was free of its doghide sheath his knees
pinned the writhing arms he lifted the
long blade

  i will not go kill me but i will not
go

  the knife didnt fall the shrill hys-
terical voice stopped it-the voice that
spoke in cherokee dialect and now close
to him ruhaya saw the warped shadowy
face of the indian the face of norn the
brother of his chief

  wild words still tumbled from the bleed-
ing mouth the head rolled from side to
side norn had been shot through the upper
chest his breathing had a shallow wet
sound as if a lung had been torn he
had lost a great deal of blood the hot
stickiness matted the hair of his torso
he lurched ciazily trying to be free of
ruhaya

  norn

  the glassy eyes stared the tongue
worked in the wet hole of the mouth norn
screamed ruhaya slapped him once
sharply across the face the scream died
the struggling stopped in the dark thic-
ket the only sound was the rasp of norns
breathing slowly the eyes focussed

  norn it is i you speak to ruhaya

  ruhaya   

  the head rolled pain bared norns
teeth  they were stained with blood

  what is it ruhaya said you hear
me norn what happened

  norn coughed and leaned against ru-
hayas knee

  they came he said thickly in the
cabin of my brother sedotee we were
holding council when they came like the
	indian stories

cat no sound but the flash of bayonets
in the doorway the blue coats and white
faces    the guns   

  sedotee ruhaya asked they took
sedotee 

  bayonets in the firelight bayonets cut
deep my brother said we would not go
to the stockade the soldiers laughed
norn stared unbelieving numb they
laughed at sedotee chief of the cherokee
he tried to stand free to fight they used
the bayonets then they used the bayonets
with great skill sedotee is dead

  and you

  i broke away they fired and i was
hit i kept running norn shook his head
all down the valley they take our peo-
ple  the braves the squaws-even the chil-
dren and our people go their chief is
dead sedotee is dead and they go like
isheep to the axe to the stockade to be
driven from their own land

  a hand caught at ruhayas arm we
will warn the others some of us must
fight they come after me even now i
heard them beating the brush yet if we
head south warn the others   

  ruhaya didnt look at the anxious pain-
warped face his chest ached with ten-
sion

  norn started to speak again fingers
clamped on his wrist

  still

  norns mouth worked

  be still ruhayas head had lifted his
nostrils quivered

  norn lay silent now ruhaya heard it-
the slow careful crunch of boots on brush

  ruhayas face turned slightly then
stopped expressionless waiting he could
see through the thicket-maze now see
the sky lighter behind the trees the faint
needlepoints of stars he crouched low
hearing the raw sound of norns breath-
ing it was too loud

  the tread of boots hesitated then came
on ruhayas leg-muscles drew tight a
shadow loomed out of deqer shadow a
figure moved tall and wary taut fists hold-
ing an army rifle at the ready the sol-
dier was only a few yards from the thicket
when norn coughed

the wetness choked in his throat
torn up from deep in his chest the
soldier swore and wheeled and the gun

lifted crazily he fired blind the yellow
flame stabbed over ruhayas head as he
closed in low dug a shoulder into the
blue cloth and slammed the trooper to
earth

  frantic hands tried to bring the rifle
butt down across ruhayas jaw ruhaya
drove a backhand under the ear the sol-
dier made one more try the bayonet
raked the cherokees thigh and then he
got in the second blow neat and sharp
at the base of the skull the trooper folded
into a briar clump and lay still breathing
slow and heavy like a man asleep

  ruhaya lurched to his feet the old
jaw-wound ached pain shot up his leg
with each bend of the knee he got back
to norn the indian lay crumpled forward
in the thicket there was blood on his lips
and his eyes had glazed again

  my father ruhaya said my father
is alone

  norn stared ruhaya slung the indians
right arm across his own shoulder and
hefted him norn could walk that was
about all he could do

  south he muttered we will go south
to warn   

  my father will help you come he
has herbs to heal your wound

  they were moving downhill now but
the going wasnt easy weaselpits caught
at norns watery legs twice he fell get-
ting him up again was like shouldering a
wet log blood made long stripes down his
chest it glistened in the pale moonlight
they struck clear of the trees and into
the fields of corn and then ruhaya pulled
up short

  he didnt see anything at first he felt
a difference a stir in the peaceable still-
ness of his fathers land he heard a faint
chink of metal then a razoredged tongue
that spilled out the words of the white
man norn looked at him liis eyes normal
for an instant

  they have come already they have
come this far

  norn swore to his gods in a low voice
he started toward the distant hulk of the
cabin ruhayas hands held him ruhaya
said stay

  the old one your father they  

  ruhaya said you are hurt stay i
will go

  he left norn crouched in the black sha-
the eagle

of kvwahi



dow of the stalks he went at a low run
loping as the fox lopes soundless bearing
down on the cabin from the rear he flat-
tened against the logwall bark scraped his
spine it was an effort to keep his breath-
ing quiet

  he made the corner just as the two
army men came through the lighted door-
way tsahuni moved between them tall
and thin and proud once he stopped and
would have spoken one of the troopers
gave him a shove

  all right old man walk when i tell
you walk

  the second shove was harder tsahuni
lost his balance and sprawled in the lamp-
lit dust

  there was no reason then no quiet
thinking in ruhayas brain for a moment
there was only blind rage his mouth
twisted and a hand closed on his knife-
hilt he took one step a cool circle of
metal pressed his spine

  if it aint the bright boy if it aint
the boy with questions all right bright
boy drop the knife

  ruhaya dropped it he knew the voice
he knew the square fists that held the
rifle trained on him the heavy blond face
the small axe and leaded quirt looped at
the belt van tilgh was beside him now
nudging the muzzle against his ribs smil-
ing he could smell whiskey on the min-
ers breath

  all right question-asker join your
brave father

  tsahuni had regained his feet he looked
old and tired his eyes were flint-cold
ruhaya did not meet his stare moving
forward into the light ruhaya watched the
soldiers the glint of long gunbarrels lev-
elled on his fathers chest

  van tilgh laughed at the army men

  didnt know about this one did you
real smart this one chockfull of clever
questions i reckoned he might be too
smart for trooperboys so i just tagged
along with  

  the noise stopped him the crashing
rustle of cornstalks beside the cabin one
of- the soldiers shouted look out and
van tilgh whirled pulling the rifle into
play norn came in fast lurching wildly
and screaming his blood very red in the
light from the doorway

  he didnt have a chance he was half-

blind his legs buckled as van tilgh drove
the metal butt sidewise under his jaw
norn went down in a manlong billow of
dust the scream came out of agony now
van tilgh towered over him

  another one he grated another
bright boy

  his heavy boot hauled back ruhaya
tensed for the spring but a gun turned
on him one of the soldiers snapped
easy van tilgh no more of that
van tilgh frowned his bull neck was
red and swollen but he didnt let go the
kick he laughed thickly and turned away

  the soldier looked at ruhaya help
him

ruhaya went to norns side the
chestwound was bleeding again slow
and heavily breath bubbled in the in-
dians throat ruhaya looked up

  he is bad hurt he needs care

  the trooper said we join the column
below here we march down to the
stockade hell be treated there

  ruhaya didnt move he needs care
now

  a ragged laugh got through van tilghs
damp lips like i told you hes a smart
one

  the soldier did not argue anymore he
raised the rifle and trained it on norns
skull his finger curled on the trigger
that was enough

  ruhaya got norn to his feet weak-
ened knees sagged wild cherokee words
choked in norns throat tsahuni crossed
and took hold of him from the other side
for a minute then ruhaya looked straight
at his father

  you see his eyes said you see now
you cannot watch norn die you cannot
stand and watch the blood of cherokee
braves and squaws darken the earth you
cannot argue with a bullet better then
to go better to move ahead of the tide

  the old man did not speak his face
was weary and expressionless but there
was still a question behind his mask
and if we go he seemed to ask will
the tide ever end will the floods ever
leave us alone

  van tilgh took the lead half-carrying
norn between them ruhaya and his fa-
ther followed the troopers brought up
the rear their guns were primed for fir-


indian stories

ing

  the downhill trace was long and pitted
and treacherous with shale norn was a
sagging deadweight he muttered in a
thick delirious voice the bleeding got
worse once he coughed and a thin red
stream ran from his mouth the father
and son halted

  ruhaya said this man needs   

  a long gun prodded his back they went
on

  halfway down the trail levelled off
and broke onto a wide open ledge they
found the column waiting ruhaya looked
down the straggling line of silent cherokee
faces braves stared back dully like men
in a dream squaws held babies close in
their shawls and the children clung in
little knots wide-eyed watching the slow
pacing soldiers who patrolled the length of
the column lost children ruhaya thought
all of them children without a leader

  the troopers moved warily scanning the
dark faces there were not many soldiers
but the rifles they gripped in tight fists
gave them the strength of many ruhaya
and tsahuni fell in at the end of the line
a few of the cherokees turned to stare at
the blood matted on norns chest they
did not speak but something hardened in
their eyes

  an officer came along the bench quick-
stepping barking orders the indians shif-
ted and faced north down the road that
headed for the stockade the officer
reached the tail of the line and said

  everything ready van tilgh  

  then he saw ruhaya and stopped short

  the captains mouth thinned his eyes
moved uneasily to tsahuni to the broken
figure that hung between father and son
the officer looked at van tilgh

  wounded 

  van tilgh started to answer

  evenly ruhaya said badly wounded
he needs rest with every step the bleed-
ing is worse

  the young captain stood there white-
lipped uncertain

  van tilgh said the major wants them
in the stockade tonight most of the col-
umns are already there well be late

  the words did something to the cap-
tain his eyes went blank he wasnt a
man anymore he was a duty-machine in
uniform he turned abruptly from the

sight of norn

  ah right he shouted you know the
orders men mah-harch

ill

they marched the cherokees
obeyed like sleepwalkers voiceless
without hope of waking the young officer
went forward quickly to take the lead for
a moment ruhaya and his father did not
move

  van tilgh smiled through the haze of
whiskey

  you heard the captain march

  ruhayas chest felt tight blood throbbed
in his temples but the rifle in van tilghs
hands was aimed dead center on tsahunis
chest in the end without a word ru-
haya took a stronger grip on the limp body
of norn they walked they followed the
long oxenlike line of cherokee prisoners

  ahead the hills pitched steep to the
pass-floor the ledge trail twisted through
dry washes and matted brush there was
no talking now there was only the wind
in the crags high above them w-ailing like
a squaw in mourning the wind and the
shuffle of aimless feet and the frightened
whimper of a cherokee baby

  then between them norn stirred his
head lifted his eyes cleared for a second
widened with sudden realization ruhaya
felt the battered form stiffen felt the cry
rip up from the lungs

  no we will not go we will stay
in the hills of kuwahi

  ruhaya and the old one tried to hold
him it was no good a last surge of
power that was more than human tore
him free of their grappling fingers norn
screamed and spun on van tilgh

  hear this hear the word of sedotee
my brother chief of the cherokee we
will stay

  indians halted and turned to stare up
at the spearhead a dark figure wheeled
the captain swore and started down the
line on the double he didnt get there
in time

  norn went in wild and blind and van
tilgh did not even stop smiling he
stepped to one side clear of the clutching
fists the leaded quirt flicked up in his
free hand lifted and sliced down vi-
ciously just as norn lunged past the
the eagle

full force of it slammed across the bleed-
ing wound

  a sudden growl ran through the chero-
kees

  the captain yelled van tilgh you
fool

  norn had stopped dead his legs folded
and he went to his knees teetering that
way for a moment the hemorrhage came
as he toppled forward a bright red river
spilling from nose and mouth soaking into
the moon white shale even after he had
quit breathing the blood kept coming the
troopers stared van tilgh swore hoarsely
and took a step toward the broken form
the hobnail boot swung back

  that was when ruhaya charged

  pent-up rage ripped the cherokee war
cry from his throat the scream crashed
like chain-lightning in the mountains of
kuwahi echoing from mouth to mouth
even as he moved in ruhaya saw the
surge of motion all down the line the
wheel and lunge of bronze bodies he saw
soldiers stagger back pulling their guns
around and heard the young officer shrill
cover take cover only it was too
late for military orders panicked troopers
fired blind into the mob an old warrior
clutched at his shoulder and pitched for-
ward squaws screamed shielding children
with their bodies the indians kept charg-
ing

  ruhaya didnt see the rest ah he saw
then was van tilghs square face close
to his the bared teeth and bloodshot eyes
the straining tendons of the bullneck his
arms locked with van tilghs he caught
the wrist of the gunhand wrenched it
back and up van tilgh bellowed and the
fingers splayed letting the rifle clatter to
earth ruhaya kicked it clear his fist col-
lared van tilgh twisting the homespun
shirtfront his free hand lifted and ham-
mered down into the warped face

  he kept hitting beating his knuckles
into the broken nose the split bleeding
lips van tilghs fingers clawed at him
the huge body heaved and a bony knee
drove high into ruhayas groin his grip
broke his eyes blurred and he went back
stumbling off-keel he fell and then van
tilgh was on his feet laughing through
that bloody mouth grabbing at the fallen
rifle and pumping the lever swinging
the muzzle full on ruhayas face the

of kuwahi	

cherokee rolled to one side

  but the shot did not come all along
the bench cries lifted and guns spurted
red needles into the night but van tilgh
never pulled the trigger

  ruhaya saw his father come in low
from the side saw van tilgh try to spin
at the last minute and the way tsahuni
straightened to his full lean height the
cherokee knife went up and down up and
down again burying itself hilt-deep in the
white throat van tilgh fell where he had
stood not far from the body of norn
he did not move again the rifle was still
in his hand his blood drained into the
sandy shale mingling slowly with the blood
of norn

  it was over then there were cherokee
wounded an old mans squaw nursed the
torn muscles of his upper arm a brave
sat quiet his teeth set against the pain
of a shell-shattered knee but a handful of
soldiers hadnt stood long against the turn
of the tide

  ruhaya straightened sweating and
breathing heavily staring down the long
ramp of the hill cherokees held the rifles
now they stood silent watching the black
brush below them the pale ribbons of the
pass-floor that trailed off toward the stock-
ade once briefly a knot of blue-coated
figures slithered into view moving fast
like cottontails with a hound-dog on their
scent

  a gnarled bony hand touched ruhayas
arm he turned and stared at his father
this time he did not look away after a
moment they locked arms hand to wrist
gripping tight and warm tsahuni said
my son and there was quiet pride in
the saying of it

  the cherokees came along the bench
in a gathering crowd to the spot where
tsahuni stood beside his son

  the women did not speak the braves
were silent but a question was in the eyes
that watched ruhaya and his father stead-
ily the eyes of men who waited to be led
ruhaya looked at his father the old one
nodded ruhaya turned then to the wait-
ing faces of his people and his voice
was deep and strong

  we are cherokees this is the land
of our fathers it is our land

  the indians murmured and drew closer
no longer dull-eyed and expressionless


indian

stories

  we will go unto the hills high above
the forests -of ocora luftee even to the
highest peak of kuwahi and we will
stay

 the murmur grew louder and more
sure on the fringe of the crowd a man
said they will come the seven thousand
will come with the guns that speak thun-
der we will die

  ruhayas shoulders squared then we
will die on our own soil

  the braves stirred with remembered
strength now the women nodded beside
his son tsahuni stood tall as the great
mountain bear he lifted one hand and
the cherokees listened

  some of us are lost the old man
said some will be herded like beasts
into a strange dead land the full mouth
set hard but we are here we are in
the hills of kuwahi and our children will
be in the hills of kuwahi and their chil-
dren

  the voice lifted like a rising wind

  i say we will not die if the bear of
the mountains is strong enough if he
stands to fight even to the death then the
hunter may leave him in peace if the
eagle fiies high and wisely then the shell
of the white mans gun can never touch
him

  that night the long trek started the
long march into the stronghold of kuwahi
peak side by side tsahuni and his son
led the way and from that night the
cherokees spoke of tsahuni with deep
quiet pride in t-heir words they called him
the eagle of kuwahi

the rest was waiting a night and
a day and a night of waiting they
had come up through the last pinebrake
beyond the timberline over paths that had
not felt the strike of the white mans boot
their camp was a cove cut in the shoulder
of kuwahi in the cool windless shadow
of the peak walled round on three sides
by sheer rock the open mouth of the cove
faced north and from a broad slab of
jutting stone they could see the restless
pinpoint fires of the stockade far down
in ocona luftee

  they did not build fires that night they
did not eat the old men curled in their
blankets and the women sang ancient songs
of peace to hungry weary children they

slept and on the lookout stone cherokee
braves lay belly-flat silent watching the
valley unsleeping tsahuni squatted on
crossed legs his eyes did not leave the fort
at his side ruhaya stood tall against the
setting moon gripping the metal and wood
of an army rifle

  the sun rose and a party of hunters
ranged warily down into the high timber
the camp ate wild rabbit and drank root
tea and before noon the sentries on the
rock saw the start of the westward re-
moval

  ruhaya stood silent and watched the
blue-coated ants scurry across the parade
of the fort saw the long column of cap-
tured cherokees march out through wide-
swung gates slow and tired and the
mounted soldiers who trotted up and down
harrying the line as a sheepdog worries the
pack

  the sentries of the rock muttered in-
dian curses a thin stripling boy clutched
his captured gun and spoke through tight
dry lips

  let them come let them try to take
us too

  and it was not only the voice of the
boy it was the voice of every man in
camp sitting quiet tsahuni studied their
faces he saw the high lean shadow of his
son against the bright sky poised and
ready the eagle of kuwahi nodded he
was content

  the change came in the evening of
the second day the cherokee prisoners
were long gone toward the dying sun
and in the dusk now the stockade lay sud-
denly lifeless the uniformed ants no
longer ran from hut to hut no echo of
busy shouting sifted up through the pass
it was too quiet tsahuni looked at his
son and ruhaya said they hold council
now this night they decide

  the cherokee camp was silent women
sat by tiny shielded fires and children for-
got to play softly an old warrior mut-
tered the war chants of his fathers and
the young braves moved like shadows
freeing their knives checking the cham-
bers of the few guns they had

  in the darkness before moonrise they
lay still at the cove-mouth dark eyes raked
the long drop of the mountain-face taut
muscles ached soundlessly ruhaya paced
the rock passing a reassuring word from
the eagle of kuwahi



man to man once far oft a cat screeched
and the stripling brave leaped up cocking
his rifle

  patience ruhaya murmured pa-
tience young one

   the boy settled down tsahuni sat at his
post a motionless part of the rock only
the old eyes moved and narrowed and
watched slowly the moon came up

  ruhaya heard the noise first his spine
went ramrod-stiff the hair at the base of
his skull felt tight he sensed his fathers
quick glance and heard one of the bucks
whisper hark

  ruhaya lifted his hand no one spoke
again behind them in the cove a child
began to cry almost without sound the
noise came again light and nearly lost
under the soughing of night wind-the
snap and whish of bramble underfoot it
came from the right just below the sen-
tinel rock in the black maw of the timber

  ruhayas gaze swung to a sudden shiver
of leaves and brush a brave rolled to
his feet a rifle glinted and arched up
drawing bead on the tall figure that broke
clear of the pines and stood unshielded in
the bright moonlight
ruhaya said hold

  the command cut across dark stillness
the cherokee froze slowly the gun-bar-
rel lowered old tsahuni did not move
neither did ruhaya his black stare was
fixed on the figure in the clearing the
lank arms and torso clad in buckskin the
leggins of fringed hide the long sharp-
planed mask of ewen gentrys face

  gentry was not carrying a rifle de-
liberately as they watched he unhitched
the shell-belt at his hips the holster and
sheathed knife he let them fall at his
feet and stood silent unarmed

  ruhayas expression did not change
he flicked a glance at tsahuni the eagle
of kuwahi nodded in a flat clear voice
ruhaya shouted

  come

  ewen gentry began to walk long mea-
sured strides his hands swinging empty at
his thighs the braves on the sentinel rock
did not relax their gunsights followed
gentry

  gentry halted a few yards from tsa-
huni and his son he ignored the trained
guns his hand came out for the clasp of
friendship

  ruhaya looked at it he did not take it
ewen gentry smiled faintly and let the
arm fall to his side the smile faded when
he said

  i come from the white leader

  the clierokees stood there staring
gentry said over the council fire i
have spoken to him and i come now with
his word

  ruhaya looked at the scout evenly
there have been many words he said
tonelessly the white man speaks with
honey but his tongue is forked

  a muscle ridged gentrys jaw he
turned to the squatting blanket-wrapped
figure of tsahuni

  you will not surrender then

  the old mans eyes only flickered it
was ruhaya who answered

  a stand must be made we have
chosen the time and the place

  the smile came back gentrys glance
moved from father to son there was a
hint of satisfied pride in his nod

  gently tsahuni said and this time
ewen gentry this time the white man
will keep his word

  their eyes met square under the worn
buckskin gentrys shoulders went straight

ffttk are not all van tilghs he
vv said i tell you this from the
start there were many white men who
hated this business we are not all crows
who wanted to feed in the fields of the cher-
okee the lips bent in that tautsmile and
even those who were-they sing another
tune now they have heard of the rout
on the ledge they have heard of tsahuni
and his son and they know the man
who walks on the ground can- never fight
the eagle who flies

  braves stirred now and muttered and
the noose of watchers tightened

  they could try gentry said the
white leader could send seven thousand
into the forests of kuwahi they might
find you and kill you but many of them
would die 

  ruhayas face was dark and tense
there was something more his mind
warned there were some words not yet
spoken because they were hard to say
his eyes narrowed on ewen gentry

  then they will leave us in peace he
asked
	indian

  he could hear gentry breathing a
frown shadowed the white scouts sun-
bleached eyes finally the hard words
came

  ocona luftee will belong to the chero-
kee for all time-after a debt has been
paid

  tsahuni looked up with black quick
eyes but his tone was still gentle

  a debt he asked

  gentry pulled air deep into his lungs
his voice had an edge now

  a white man was killed last night
van tilgh-a white man who was not
of the army the miners are roused
they call it murder they demand blood
for blood

the noose surged inward the mutter
lifted to a growl and one brave raised his
rifle the eagle of kuwahi said wait
the sound died checkreined anger
throbbed in indian eyes

  quietly gentry said it is the law of
the whites blood for blood or the miners
take action force the army to attack your
camp a cherokee must come to the stock-
ade a cherokee must face the guns of
the firing squad and from where the
sun stands at the moment of his death
your people will be free ocona luftee
will be theirs

  tsahuni did not speak the anger was
gone now squaws and bucks watched the
squatted figure with something new in
their faces-some stirring flicker of re-
membered hope ruhaya did not wait for
his fathers word in a quiet voice he said
i killed the man called van tilgh
ewen gentry frowned the cherokees
murmured

  speak to the white leader ruhaya
said tell him his terms will be met
no my son

  the bright blanket rustled like the stir-
ring of powerful wings tsahuni rose
slowly to his full height someone whis-
pered the eagle speaks and there was
no other sound

  father and son stood facing each other
in the same quiet voice ruhaya said

  i am not afraid

  the old lips bent slightly the bony
chin lifted you are a cherokee my son
a cherokee is strong enough to die the
shadow of a smile faded yet there is
another kind of strength

stories

  tsahuni did not say the rest of the
words there was no need they were
there in the steady black brilliance of his
old eyes

  i have a dream my son our people
will live the young braves will go again
into the coves of ocona luftee they will
take squaws and their women will bear
men-children their sons will till the fields
of our valley and their sons after them
and in the years to be the cherokee will
be many and strong again and at peace
in his own land i have a dream my son
the young braves are the seed of my
dream and the seed must not perish

  another kind of strength tsahuni
said aloud then the young men must be
strong enough to live-and watch an old
man die

  the cherokees stirred and ruhayas lips
opened to speak the glance of tsahuni
stopped him ruhaya straightened and his
jaw was a hard-drawn line all he said
was yes my father

  high in the stillness an eagle screamed
tsahuni turned to face the white scout

  i will come he said quietly before
the sun is high the debt will be paid

  for a long minute ewen gentry did
not move his face was pale and gaunt
but that proud smile touched his lips in
the end he held out his hand he locked
wrists with the eagle of kuwahi the grip
was strong and final

iv

morning was a pale haze on the
rim of the smokies birds stirred in
their rooks and made a shrill music dawn-
mists still clung to the high rocks when
the two cherokees quit the camp under
kuwahi peak they went slowly by ancient
indian paths and after a while behind
them they could hear the women singing
the death chant

  they did not look back they did not
speak tsahuni walked straight now and
sure of foot draped in the robes and
amulets of the warrior no longer old of
face and body somehow as tall and young
as the son who walked at his side

  the stockade was waiting ewen gentry
had gone ahead carrying back the answer
of the eagle and now the high palisade
catwalk was lined with blue-coated men
the eagle

armed and wary ruhaya and his father
went down the last slopes onto the green
flats of the valley into the pass that
stretched north across a meadow to the
double gates of the fort

  the man-tall wicket was open and in-
side a column of troopers stood to atten-
tion charged rifles to shoulder statue-like
in the sun-bright dust of the parade the
commanding major came forward ewen
gentry pacing at his side the major
lifted one hand in a smart salute ruhaya
heard the wicket slam sharply behind them

  bayonets winked white in the sun tsa-
huni and his son stood silent watching
the broad dusty-blue figure of the major
the stiff black beard the still-wary eyes
that reached across the compound to the
sutlers building where a crowd of miners
waited hard-faced and determined

  finally the major said you have
come

  a glint of humor touched the old chero-
kees face

  you did not believe i would major

  there was no answer uneasily the
major flicked a glance at gentry then
his eyes steadied his tone went calm and
official

  there is a paper to be signed

  tsahuni only nodded the major and
gentry led the way past the rigid column
of the firing squad past the watching
miners and across a low portico into the
cool shadows of headquarters building

  the room was quiet and musty-smelling
faint sunlight touched the union flag that
draped one wall the major stood by the
yellow-oak desk and read the words from
the long white paper the words of faith
and hope he picked up a quill pen and
set his name at the foot of the writing
he held out the pen to tsahuni a minute
passed tsahuni looked straight at the
white leader his stare bright and probing
at last he took the quill and made the
sign of an eagles spread wings on the
paper he set the pen down

  the major stood very stiff his boots
shifted his voice was hard to control

  there is no more to be done he said
the squad is waiting

  tsahunis expression did not change
he simply nodded and turned toward the
door but in that moment something wav-

of kuwahi	

ered in the bronze mask of ruhayas face
his mouth worked and sudden fingers
closed on the old thin arm

  my father   

  he didnt say any more tsahuni looked
at him quietly and said the bargain has
been made ruhaya and dark sounding
eyes swung to the major our promise
will be kept

  the major straightened gave the old
cherokee a salute the movement was
touched with a deep growing respect

  all promises will be kept the major
said

  ruhaya let go of his fathers arm they
went out into the morning light side by
side looking neither right nor left

  on the sutlers porch the knots of
miners grew tighter with remembered an-
ger they watched the eagle of kuwahi
cross the parade with slow even strides
his head high his eyes unblinking against
the sun they saw him pause for a second
and the way his hand held the hand of
his son that was all

  ruhaya stood very still his arms at
his sides watching his father walk to the
north wall then turn with his back to the
long palisade facing the line of soldiers
nobody mentioned a blindfold gentry
stood silent at ruhayas elbow once
strong fingers gripped the cherokees arm
gentry nodded and winked somehow that
helped

  the major took his position his saber
flashed up and the squad came to atten-
tion he snapped an order stocks came
against padded shoulders bayonets quiv-
vered with light

  fire

  ruhaya stood there only his hands
knotted once at his sides the knuckles
showed dead white the blast crashed out
across the valley and died a slow death in
the foothills and there was a sting of burnt
powder on the hot still air tsahuni fell
slowly like an old tree touched at last by
the broadaxe but a tree with taproots
sunk into the good soil of ocona luftee
deep and undying

  nobody moved army horses nickered
and slowly the execution detail lowered
their rifles boots moved away single-file
lifting a small fog of dust around the min-
ers grouped under the sutlers awning

deadly as the speeding arrow sly as the moccasined stalker the siren
cheyenne squaw planted her charms and her guile among the blue-coated
legions of fort dodge    then touched off the fuse that dynamited
little bears painted braves into a savage war of attrition

although there remained an hour
before taps the post had settled
down for a quiet warm night punc-
tuated only by the soft playing of a har-
monica in one of the enlisted mens bar-
racks and an occasional ripple of laughter
from the windows in the bachelor officers
quarters along officer row streamed yel-
low shafts of light through which the sha-
dow of a recruit sentry passed at regular
intervals beyond sudsville where lived
the non-commissioned officers with their
wives-most of whom did post washing to
subsidize the meager army pay of their
husbands-was the stockade the outer de-
fense of the fort a log wall some twenty
feet in height and guarded by more of the
blue-uniformed sentries this was fort

the bozeman trail

  first lieutenant lee f dupuy cavalry
slammed the door of the boq behind him
and strode across the parade field through
the still night buttoning his dark-blue tunic
as he walked he passed the flag staff
white and lofty in the moonlight and
paused before a well-lighted hutment
larger than the rest of the living quarters
on the post and bearing the yellow guidon
of the rd cavalry regiment as he made
a final adjustment of his uniform he read
the sign which he had so often seen be-
fore and which always put him uneasily on
his guard

 colonel matthew hanks

commanding
rd cavalry regt

ft dodge

  as he put his boot on the first step lee
heard the colonels voice raised in anger



  and you can damned well stay inside
when youre drunk mary said the col-
onel loudly

  lee winced he had no intentions of
breaking into a quarrel between the col-
onel and his wife but he didnt see how
it could be avoided the co had sent for
him a woman inside replied in a low voice
that he couldnt understand then the col-
onel spoke again

  leave that out of it its dropped you
hear me its over ive sent him back
to his troop and you wont have him
around everytime i leave the post i dont
mind you making a fool of yourself but

i	wont have you disgracing me before my
command do you hear me this new
striker is a mexican and i wont have you
in the same room with him unless im pre-
sent do you understand that mary an-
swer me

  you righteous creature you replied
the woman raising her voice you dont

form and a book of army regulations
you and your attempts at respectability
dont you think i know about you and
that indian girl do you think you could
install her in my house as a domestic
servant and me not see what was going
on you make me laugh matt what
did you expect me to do sit back and wel-
come her like a civilized half-sister from
cincinnati 

  leave pearl out of this commanded
the colonel sternly

  lee stood before the hutment quietly
listening the colonels domestic troubles
were the common gossip of the garrison
and lee would have preferred to
have reported to his commanding
officer in the morning but giving
easily unhurriedly the indian girl swung her musket around on the commanding officer
and very deliberately pulled the trigger




indian stories

the tail of his tunic a final brave tug he
stamped boldly on the steps and walked
heavily across the wooden planks of the
porch

  if he cant hear this thought lee
hes deaf

  as he knocked on the doorway lie heard
an excited scurrying inside and through
the shutters he caught sight of mrs mary
hanks hurrying out of the room she was
a handsome dark-haired woman in her
early thirties much younger than the col-
onel himself

  come in said col hanks unplea-
santly

  lee pushed open the door and stood
with his cap tucked under his arm

  lt dupuy reporting to the command-
ing officer as directed sir lie said salut-
ing

  come in mister come in said hanks
i didnt intend to arouse you after youd
retired

  i hadnt retired sir

  no the colonel looked him up and
down then you make a practice of dress-
ing without your sash mister

  knowing well that he had left his yel-
low dress sash across the foot of his
bunk lee did not reply

  you are out of uniform arent you
mister 

  damn you hanks thought lee to
himself

answer me sir when i address you
i seem to have forgotten it when your
striker called for me sir lee started
to say new striker but thought better of
it i came immediately

  you    seemed to have forgotten it
   mocked the colonel a careless of-
ficer doesnt last long in my command
mister bear that in mind

  yes sir

  i sent for you because it has occurred
to me that the cheyenne might be tempted
to bolt off their reservation with the com-
ing of this warm weather the southern
cheyenne have gone on the war path in
colorado and some of our own reserva-
tion indians want to join them theyre
pretty restless

  the monthly supply train left fort
laramie last saturday and they should be
about sixty miles east of our post right
now in the morning you will take your

platoon and escort them in youll be gone
a day or so

  does the colonel expect trouble from
american dog sir  asked lee

  i dont believe ive put you at ease
mister

  lee hit a brace

  we signed a treaty with old chief
american dog at powder river last fall
but his war chief little bear has been
stirring up the tribe again he wants to
take his braves the crazy dog society
off the reservation to join the southern
cheyenne american dog doesnt want to
let him go but hell follow the will of
his people little bear is a powerful chief
all during the war he had it his own
way out here and he thinks the wyoming
territory is just a cheyenne back yard
yes sir

  ive got the only two passages to the
south-the east cut and broken arrow
canyon-watched by our friendly crow
scouts the cheyenne cant slip through
there the only trouble they can cause us
is raiding inside the territory and they
might want to knock over that supply
train if they think they can get away
with it any questions mister

  no sir saluted lee turning in his
tracks he walked stiffly from the room

  outside on the parade field again he
put his cap on his head and looked
around uncertainly then he walked briskly
across the way to the enlisted barracks
which housed his platoon and hearing the
laughter inside the building he smiled and
stopped

sanchez his platoon sergeant be-
tween sketches of tunes on his har-
monica was telling the new recruits about
little bears cheyenne lance sanchez was
a good soldier in the confederate army
before he was made prisoner at gettys-
burg he had commanded his own troop

  old matt will give fifty u s dollars
to the man that captures it sanchez was
saying its an old th century spanish
lance thats been in little bears tribe for
generations the cheyenne probably took
it from the spanish explorers three hun-
dred years ago

  lee thought of the steel lance hed
seen it only once last fall when they had
fought the cheyenne at powder river
bride of the tomahawk pack	

and drove them back on their reservation
hed seen the half-breed little bear mag-
nificent in his chiefs war-bonnet charge
two infantry soldiers and run them both
through with a single thrust because he
thought the weapon was charmed little
bear wouldnt go into battle without it
colonel hanks had a standing reward of-
fered for its capture

  not for five hundred dollars would i
risk my neck for the damned thing came
a second voice from the barracks

  lee frowned through the window he
saw a tall dark-haired trooper rise from
his cot he was slender and quick of
movement and was about lees own age
this was the colonels former striker
private cooke

  it may be said sanchez that youll
risk your neck in spite of everything if
little bear leads his crazy dogs off their
reservation this spring

  cooke snorted

  lee was sorry to have him back for
platoon duty he was well-read and in-
telligent but an agitator and a trouble-
maker in the troop he had never been
discreet regarding his affairs with the col-
onels wife and exactly why he had left
the east to join the army lee didnt
know

     and trooper cooke will be re-
placed by trooper juarez as my striker
private cooke will report back to captain
lonnigans troop for duty   sang
out another voice from inside the barracks
mocking colonel hanks words that after-
noon at retreat

  there was laughter in the barracks

  go to hell said cooke unpleasantly

  a cheer for trooper cooke and the
colonels lady said another voice

  go to hell said cooke again loudly

  thats all right cooke laughed an-
other trooper if you cant get the old
mans wife maybe you can get his injun
gal pearl white feathers

  at that another laugh went up from
the cavalry soldiers

  and if you dont want the injun gal
you can send her over to the barracks
laughed the voice

  lee could see trooper cooke stretched
out on his cot again apparently undis-
turbed by the taunts of his saddle mates

-indian stories-winter

he was not too well liked by them

  lee glanced about him and strode into
the lighted barracks

  attention bellowed sgt sanchez who
saw the young officer first

  as you were called lee quickly as the
troopers rose to their feet then in a
lower voice to sanchez have the pla-
toon ready to move out at five in the
morning sergeant in full marching order
and  rounds of ammunition per carbine
well travel light and draw our ammuni-
tion from the wagon- train were going to
escort in from fort laramie

  trouble with the cheyenne already
lieutenant 

  no not yet the colonel just wants
to be prepared well take the whole pla-
toon said lee raising his eyes toward
trooper cooke will there be any ab-
sences 

  only a man in the guardhouse sir
smiled the sergeant

  very well then the men can get their
breakfast at the mess hall at four-thirty
any questions 

  no sir saluted sanchez

  good-night sergeant saluted lee

  he walked across the parade field once
again this time toward captain lonni-
gans quarters to tell him that the st
platoon would not fall out with troop
c the next morning the captain was
new to the territory he had been as-
signed to the rd cavalry only a few
months before

  from the windows of the captains house
streamed a yellow light as he approached
closer lee saw two figures seated in the
front room-second lieutenant don brag-
gel who had the first platoon in c
troop and captain lonnigans nineteen-
year-old daughter irish braggel was en-
gaged to the girl and they planned to be
married when he was promoted to st
lieutenant

  lee decided not to go in he wouldnt
disturb braggels heart pursuits the
younger boy had a forward boisterousness
about him that both amused and interested
lee he enjoyed having him in the troop
fresh from west point the boy was
cocky and ambitious and had not yet
dropped the undergraduate traditions of
the war college he had- missed the war
but was determined to see isome action


indian

stories

on the indian frontier lee was entertained
by the thought that given an opportunity
the boy would fight the whole indian na-
tion single handed to catch the eye of
the captains daughter

  turning away from the captains quar-
ters he walked across the field toward
the boq and entered

  as he passed down the hall lee looked
in on lt donahues room and found the
old white-haired officer of c troop rd
platoon stretched out on his cot reading
the decline and fall of the roman empire
he was sixty-one years old and had com-
manded his own regiment during the war
brevetted twice but had been reduced to
a first lieutenant again to await his re-
tirement

  i just left a friend of yours lieuten-
ant smiled lee from the doorway

  oh lee come in come in said the
old officer cordially rising from his cot and
closing the book what friend have i in
this forsaken hole

  colonel hanks laughed lee

  old matt may his soul burn in hell
you know he served under me for a while
at the beginning of the war he made
brigadier later

  yes i know said lee

  what did he want ask you to shoot
that trooper in your platoon for infring-
ing upon his marital tranquility

  no not as bad as all that smiled
lee

  i noticed at retreat this afternoon that
he replaced that trooper with a new
striker matts a fool

  lee laughed it is a pretty sad situa-
tion he agreed this trooper cooke
is a trouble-maker i wish the colonel
hadnt sent him back to me

  oh well said donahue ill be out
of it all in another month or so forty-
two years of it god i must have been
a crazy young fool when i joined the
army i only hope my retirement comes
through before we start another indian
campaign hell lee im an old man
the colonels getting ready for them
already said t ee hes sending my pla-
toon out to escort the supply train in
from fort laramie

  when do you leave

  tomorrow early replied lee ive
got to get some sleep

  sure lee good-night said dona-
hue

  lee went down the hall to his own
room he took his spencer repeating car-
bine from the wall and from a box in
his foot locker slipped seven -cal metal
cartridges into the tube magazine in the
butt after working the action freely sev-
eral times he replaced the -inch weapon
in the rack from his holster hanging at
the foot of his cot he removed a regulation
colt -cal and held the hammer with
his thumb while he spun the chamber

  then he noticed his yellow dress sash
across the foot of his cot damn you
hanks he tossed the sash on his foot
locker and sat down on the bunk to re-
move his boots

  pearl white feathers he mused she
must have come up from the cheyenne
indian school at laramie

  undressed he blew out the oil lamp
and crawled into his sack got to escort
the supply train in from laramie in the
darkness he heard the sentry in front of
the boq call out to challenge another of-
ficer coming home late little bears lance
in a few minutes he heard lt broggel
come in and enter his room across the
hall singing to himself

  lee fell asleep before taps and
dreamed about the crazy dog lance

ii

there was a shouting on the parade
field and lee opened his eyes and
lay quietly listening in the darkness of
his room the shouting continued lee
took his pocket watch from the footlocker
beside his bunk and saw that it was only
 am he had been asleep but a few
hours then shattering the quiet of the
sleeping post came the sound of the bugle
blowing boots and saddles

  what the hell thought lee

  he dressed quickly pulled on his heavy
cavalry boots and buckled on his pistol
and saber he tied a yellow kerchief about
his neck for field duty taking his spencer
carbine from the rack he fastened it at
his right side to a broad leather belt which
slung diagonally across his left shoulder

  as he passed braggels room lee saw
the young officer busily loading the tube
magazine of his own spencer at the op-
bride of the tomahawk pack



posite end of the hall lt donahue ran
out of his room slinging a leather riding
quirt the old cavalry soldier was cursing
at being blown out in the middle of
the night

  lee stepped out the door of the boq
and saw a scene of utter confusion on the
drill field from the stables troopers with
saddles and blankets thrown over their
shoulders were leading out their horses
half-dressed officers hurried across the
field buckling on their sabers and pulling
on gloves as they ran

  this must be another of old matts
night drills thought lee to himself an-
grily

  then from colonel hanks quarters a
bugler blew officers call

  sgt sanchez called lee toward the
barracks which housed his platoon have
someone saddle my mount

  right sir replied the non-com from
the building he stood barefoot in the door-
way wearing only his blue trousers and
cap

  lee ran across the parade field with his
saber rattling at his side and the butt of
the carbine slung from his shoulder slap-
ping him in the rump a number of officers
were already gathered in front of the col-
onels quarters when he arrived colonel
hanks standing properly dressed and
calmly waiting on the front porch glared
down at his harassed officers in a manner
that bordered on contempt at his left
stood a negro infantryman bloody and
bandaged leaning on the banister for sup-
port a light was burning in the window
behind him

  at last we are all here gentlemen
asked hanks as lt donahue ran up a
chorus of low voices replied

  lee standing on the outer fringes of
the little group saw the colonels wife
come to the window and look out at the
assembled officers she was wearing a night
gown with a blanket hastily pulled about
her bare shoulders and her dark hair fell
about her neck and formed a soft frame
for her face

  gentlemen said hanks with an ac-
tors appreciation for the dramatic the
supply train has been attacked by a large
cheyenne war party

  in the darkness the field-grade officers
voiced muttered comments

  a messenger has just come through
to me the wagons left fort laramie last
thursday instead of saturday they were
only about twenty miles from here at hells
basin when they were attacked yesterday
afternoon they are manned by twelve
men and a white officer of the th infantry
negro this soldier tells me and he was
able to escape only because he was scouting
on the forward point he ran the whole
distance to our post on foot

  hanks looked over the group as if to
single out a particular officer

  lt dupuy

  here sir replied lee

  your platoon should be ready to move
out you will advance to the scene of
the attack and relieve the infantry if they
are still holding out if they have been
killed then you will scout the surrounding
countryside to determine in which direction
the indians were heading the regiment
will stand alerted here awaiting your re-
port any questions mister

  no sir

  lee saluted and hurried back to the
barracks of troop cs nd platoon
the men were just finishing saddling their
horses he took his own horse from sgt
sanchez and mounted

  stand to horses shouted lee holding
his saber very straight at his side the
platoon fell in by their animals

  mount commanded lee by twos
forward-ho

  lee moved his horse to the head of
the column and led them out as they
approached theeast gate the two heavy
wooden doors swung inward to let them
pass outside the stockade

  at a trot commanded lee then at
a gallop

  behind him he could hear the banging
of the sabers as the troopers rode at his
side the spencer bounced against his back
and he unfastened the carbine and slipped
it into the saddle boot under his leg

  where to this time lieutenant  asked
sgt sanchez pulling abreast of the young
officer

  the supply train was attacked about
twenty miles up the trail think well
make it

  if the wagons hold out until nightfall
well make it the cheyenne wont attack
after dark they think a warrior killed at


indian stories

night stays in the darkness forever so
theyll wait until morning then rush the
wagons

  after that they rode hard and without
speaking sometimes at a gallop and again
at a walk to ease the horses whenever
lee lifted his arm above his head to signal
the platoon they left the plains and fol-
lowed the bozeman trail into the hill
country just as the first evidences of
dawn streaked the eastern sky in front
of them lee reined-up his horse at the
edge of hells basin a natural valley
through which the trail cut the platoon
stopped behind him

  sergeant sanchez rode up beside lee
and dismounted i dont hear any firing
he said

  lee pointed into the basin and you
wont hear any either they are down
there in the basin sergeant

  sanchez followed the gesture of his of-
ficers hand at the bottom of the slope
he saw the burned remains of what had
been five wagons now charred and smok-
ing and the corpses of the army mules
the stripped bare lodies of the twelve
negro infantry soldiers lay sprawled
about the wagons and among the dead ani-
mals

  i guess they didnt even have a chance
said lee surveying the terrain

  the indians probably waited until the
column was inside the basin then swooped
down on four sides they didnt even
have time to draw up the wagons in a
perimeter defense agreed sanchez with-
out enthusiasm

  well said lee signaling with his
arm lets get down there

  he led the platoon sliding slipping over
the loose earth down the steep hill when
they reached the wagons he signaled for
them to dismount

  well have to get this mess cleaned
up said lee making it as impersonal as
he could he sat down on the corpse of
a mule and pulled an arrow free ser-
geant what kind of shaft is this he
callcd

  sanchez walked up cheyenne arrow
lieutenant

  how many in the party

  sanchez walked over the ground exam-
ining the tracks of the indian ponies
about a hundred and fifty id say lieu-

tenant they had all the time they needed
too had plenty of time to torture their
prisoners yesterday afternoon

  he pointed to four mutilated bodies
staked out on the ground

  lee saw cooke his face paste white
looking at the bodies he leaned against
his horse and stared at lee with fixed
eyes

  lee felt sorry for him you going
to be sick trooper

  no

  its pretty awful said lee

  why dont they fight like human beings
instead of beasts roared cooke

  this is all they know replied lee
theyve been torturing their prisoners
and hacking up bodies since the stone age
cooke came over and sat down on the
mule beside lee i guess im not used
to this business he said

  none of us are

  were    were these people scalped
no said lee the cheyenne dont
take scalps from negro soldiers they
call them buffalo soldiers because of their
short hair and big wooly garrison coats
that they wear in winter the cheyenne
think its bad medicine to scalp them
look here a minute lieutenant said
sanchez holding a springfield single-shot
musket with a burned and shattered stock
he dangled a looped cord tied to the trig-
ger some of them were able to shoot
themselves before they were captured
cooke looked at the platoon sergeant
what is that string he asked

  sanchez seeing the trooper seated on
the mule beside his officer glared back
at him

  they made a stand said sanchez
coldly and when they saw the savages
were going to overrun the wagons they
tied looped cords around their triggers
pulled off their boots and pulled the
triggers with their toes

  the infantry is armed with the long-
barrel springfield explained lee you
cant put the muzzle of one of them against
your head and reach the trigger at the
same time

  if youre through resting trooper you
can help the platoon clean up this busi-
ness said sanchez in his hard drill-field
manner cooke got up reluctantly and
walked away the platoon sergeant sat

clown on the dead mule beside lee

  not only is he a trouble-maker said
sanchez but i suspect hes a coward
id hate to know my life depended on
him in a skirmish with little bear

  hell be alright

  i wish he was back striking for the
colonel

  lee ignored the remark sergeant tell
me why did trooper cooke join the
army anyway

  he was a college man sir i hear in
the barracks that he got into trouble and
had to leave the east

  thank you sergeant smiled lee
the lieutenant is entirely welcome
the troopers were collecting the bodies
in neat rows to await the burial wagons
from fort dodge collecting their dead
was a point of honor with the cavalry
some of the soldiers were making a bundle
of the arrows lying about to take back
to the fort if the guilty cheyenne could
be captured and brought to trial the
shafts would be used as evidence against
them

  sergeant called lee get three men
and have them track this war party for a
few miles to see which direction they
were heading

  right sir replied sanchez he was
looking oddly at the mutilated body of the
white officer who had commanded the wa-
gon train several troopers had gathered
about him

  what is it asked lee approaching

sanchez looked at him for a minute
without speaking im afraid were
in for a bad summer campaign lieuten-
ant he said at last this is little bears
work all right hes left the reservation
remember what he did to captain fetter-
mans patrol at powder river last fall
this white officer got the same thing
little bear didnt scalp him but he made
sure he wouldnt have a whole body when
he got to the happy hunting ground
that sneaky cheyenne half-breed filled
the mans mouth full of gun powder and
blew his head off just like he did to cap-
tain fetterman

  lee grimaced up until this time he had
acted very well before the platoon all
right put him with the rest he said
not looking down at the man

  sanchez started to say something to
him then turned back to the troopers all
right you heard the lieutenant put him
with the others

  lee went back and sat down digging
his saber in the ground before him be-
tween his feet he had been raised on
the frontier but he still had a cold feeling
on the back of his scalp when it came to
indian raids

  sanchez came up presently weve
done all we can do for now lieutenant
well have to go back and send the burial
wagons to pick up this

  your patrol is out sergeant

  i sent three men to trail the cheyenne
sir theyll catch up with us later
then have the men mount up

  the sun was well in the morning sky
when lee led his platoon back out of the
basin having ridden hard during the
night the platoon moved their horses at
a trot pausing only now and then to
await the advance signal of the two
troopers who were scouting on the point
ahead of the column

  hearing a shrill whistle behind him
lee turned in his saddle and saw the
trooper scouting the rear lift his carbine
with both hands above his head

  somebody riding hard down the trail
behind us lieutenant said sanchez tak-
ing his spencer from his saddle boot

  the next moment three blue-clad cavalry
soldiers galloped around the bend and
pulled up sharply beside the officer

  we followed them cheyenne lieu-
tenant said the corporal saluting lee
we tracked them about four miles and
found where they camped last night they
were heading north then they swung west
toward the fort hard to say where they
were going sir

  sergeant said lee wed better ride
over to will eubanks place and tell him
to bring his family dow-n to fort dodge
until this thing blows over

  at a signal from sanchez the cavalry-
men left the trail and broke into the tim-
ber an hours ride through the woods
with sabers and canteens rattling against
the brush brought the platoon to an edge
of a clearing where stood a log cabin
as he led the men across the cleared land
lee heard the barking of dogs and the
shouting of children about the house


indian

stories

  pa pa here comes the cavalry pa
shouted a child excitedly

  halt commanded lee as he drew the
platoon up before the cabin and mind
you dont trample mrs eubanks corn
he laughed

  howdy lee said eubank coming
around the edge of the log cabin carrying
in his hand an ancient percussion musket
and a powder horn

  hello will i just rode over to tell
you that little pears left the reservation
again hes got a big crazy dog scalping
party on the loose again

  him and that damned cheyenne lance
again said eubank if you soljer-boys
would capture it away from him lee he
wouldnt be so unneighborly-like

  lee laughed easily we try will we
try

  you think i ought to move sarah and
her brood down to dodge shes on her
fourth you know

  mrs eubank standing in her big apron
in the cabin door blushed and moved in-
side again

  youd better little bears got his dan-
der up he wiped out our supply train
from laramie over on the trail yester-
day afternoon

  well i dont reckon to be in fore
tomorrow i got some cattle up on the
ridge thatll take a day to round up
were going back now said lee do
you want mrs eubank and the kids to
ride in with us

  i reckon not son i can take care o
my folks as well as you yankee soljers
can

  you know im no yankee at heart
will laughed lee

  but you got on a blue uniform and a
yellow stripe down your breeches

  alright will lee smiled he led the
platoon across the stump land to pick up
the trail back to the fort

  the rear scout riding through the tim-
ber far behind the column watched cur-
iously as a flight of quail passed over him
in terror

  musta been scared by an old grizzly
he mused

ill

after another hour in the sad-
dle the platoon with lee at its head

reached the crest of the hills which over-
looked the short plains around fort dodge

  hold up commanded lee as he lifted
his arm he dismounted and the platoon
followed him wearily sprawling out on
the ground lee wanted to rest his horse
before taking them into dodge an officer
could lose his commission for winding his
mount in colonel hanks command it was
a common joke in the regiment that the
colonel made and broke men so often that
his non-coms put on their chevrons with
hooks-and-eyes

  the sun was almost directly above them
now and lee wiped his wet face with
the yellow kerchief tied loosely about his
neck it was hot

  from fort dodge a neat brown box
in the distance on the plains as correct
and precise itself as the regiment which
garrisoned it rose thin trails of smoke
from the cooking fires of the noon meal
lee reflected that in his platoon they hadnt
eaten since the night before

  he lay on his stomach with his chin
in his hands and watched the fort the
plains seemed to roll away behind it like
the ocean beyond far across the level
land a blue rise in the west marked the
beginning of the mountain ranges

  suddenly from the fort he saw four
horsemen emerge like dark specks on a
sheet of yellow and fan out across the
plains the dust hung heavily in the air
behind them

  sergeant

  sanchez came up and dropped down
on his knees beside the young officer

  looks like the regimental scouts said
the platoon sergeant watching as the four
horsemen galloped in their direction

  in a moment the sergeants observation
was verified when from the gates of the
fort snaked a lengthy blue column sur-
rounded by a haze of dust lee watched
the column moving across the plain at
the rear two wagons with white canvas
coverings moved rapidly to keep up with
the cavalry when the column drew close
enough lee picked out the thirds yellow
guidon riding with a trooper at the head
of the regiment by counting the gaps in
the blue line lee figured that there were
fourteen troops of cavalry in the saddle

the colonel has the whole regiment
out today except for the station force
bride of the tomahawk pack



odservecf lee standing up wonder what
has happened

  he probably thinks you got cut off
by little bear

  no he wouldnt send a whole regi-
ment to rescue a single platoon replied
lee mount up he called lets go
meet them

  lee led the platoon down from the hills
and rode out toward the regiment

  sergeant sanchez take the platoon
back to join captain lonnigans troop ill
report to colonel hanks

  lee broke away from his platoon gal-
loped up before the regimental co and
fell in beside him

  lt dupuy reporting sir we reached
the wagon train at sun-up this morning
they had been wiped out yesterday after-
noon we recovered the bodies of twelve
negroes and one white officer

  how many indians in the scalp party
mister asked the colonel dully

  about a hundred and fifty my scouts
found the place where they camped last
night but it was hard to say where they
were going sir

all right mister rejoin your troop
lee started to ask him the regiments
destination but thought better of it and
spurred his horse off to the rear of the
column

  captain lonnigan and lieutenant brag-
gel were riding side by side at the head
of troop c

  did you see anything lee asked
lonnigan anxiously

  the cheyenne wiped out that supply
train yesterday why

  why doesnt he hurry exploded
young braggel well never catch them
trotting along like this

  mrs hanks came to my quarters this
morning explained lonnigan she asked
irish to ride with her up to william eu-
banks place to bring back his wife to fort
dodge until the regiment could round
up little bear and his crazy dog band
at the time it seemed safe enough to me
you let your daughter ride out with
mrs hanks demanded lee

  i thought little bear would be a hun-
dred miles from here after attacking that
supply train besides that half-breed girl
who works for the colonel pearl white
feathers was going to drive the wagon

for them

  little bear will be out of the wyoming
territory with those two women before
we can catch up with him this was
braggel again

  almost an hour ago continued lonni-
gan pearl came back to the fort alone
and said that little bear had captured
them before they even got to eubanks
place but that she had escaped little
bear carried off irish and the colonels
lady

  the colonelis taking the whole regi-
ment to get them back interrupted brag-
gel

  lee did not answer but rode back to
join his platoon when he had told san-
chez the sergeant only grunted

  hell never find little bear by using
the whole regiment he observed that
sneaky cheyenne half-breed probably has
his scouts up in the hills watching this
very minute

  i know said lee but the colonel
thinks he can frighten little bear with
a show of strength hed do better by send-
ing just a troop

  how is lt braggel taking it about
his sweathearts capture questioned san-
chez who rather liked the young officer
himself

  he wants to go out and fight the whole
cheyenne nation single-handed

  and the captain

  hes new out here sergeant he
doesnt realize what kind of danger his
daughter is in he doesnt know what
the indians do to white women and i
hope that young fool braggel keeps his
mouth shut

  sanchez nodded grimly

fastened legion-style to the back
of his cap the white kerchief which
the colonel wore to keep his neck from
sun-blistering fluttered distinctively behind
his head as he wheeled his mount away
from the four-abreast column of cavalry
and stood watching it past

  regiment his voice floated back
faintly to lees ears

  squadron came a second command
louder and closer which was repeated by
other squadron commanders behind him

  troop bellowed captain lonnigan at
the head of his command
	indian

  the colonels voice far at the front of
the column followed up his preparatory
command with the command of execution
at a gallop ho

  the regiment instantly became more
alive the troopers urged their horses to
a gallop and the banging of the sabers
and metal equipment increased proportion-
ately lee could hear the teamsters with
their wagons at the rear of the regimental
column shouting and driving their mules
to keep up

  they covered ground quickly now after
a few minutes the wagons were a couple
of hundred yards behind and by the time
the regiment had broken into the hill
country the two wagons were but faint
clouds of dust behind them

  he wont keep this up much longer
shouted lee to sanchez after the column
had been moving at the grueling pace for
almost an hour the colonel loves his
horses too much the animals were
breaking into a white sweat after being
reined in so closely to the column

  maybe he loves his wife more shouted
sanchez he was thinking of a trooper
in the regiment whod run his horse to
death last fall to bring the word of captain
fettermans ambush at powder river the
colonel was making the cavalryman pay
for his mount out of his  dollars a
month pay the trooper had figured it
would take him another two years to pay
the  value that was set on the
army horse

  the regiment came to an abrupt halt

  as the troopers sat breathing heavily
in their saddles sanchez reached over and
tugged at the sleeve of lees blue tunic
he pointed toward a column of black
ptnoke which lifted up from beyond the
wooded hills a few miles away to their
left

  looks like will eubanks place said
lee

  sanchez nodded

  the drum of hoofbeats of a single horse-
man galloping down the length of the col-
umn came to lees ears the troopers
turned in their saddles eagerly watching
the striker to see at which troop he
would stop

  the mexican trooper reined-in at troop
c

  lee spurred his horse up to the head

stories

of the column where lonnigan and brag-
gel waited

  colonel hanks compliments to cap-
tain lonnigan sir said the striker he
ask that you have lieutenants braggel
donahue and dupuy report to him at
the head of the column

  mister donahue called captain lon-
nigan the old white haired officer spurred
his horse up from his platoon at the rear
of troop c

  yes sir

  report forward to the colonel said
lonnigan he motioned lee and braggel
fonvard with a gesture of his hand

  the three officers rode back down the
line with the colonels striker while the
regiment waited patiently in their saddles
the occasional snorting of a winded horse
and the creaking of leather were the only
breaks in the stillness

  colonel hanks returned their salutes
and eyed them coldly

  mister donahue weve left the burial
wagons behind leave your platoon un-
der the command of your sergeant and
take personal charge of those two wagons
you will proceed to the point where the
supply train from fort laramie was at-
tacked and collect the bodies of those
men for burial wait at that point for the
regiment questions mister

  yes sir thundered donahue im
no wagon soldier colonel why must
i be taken away from my platoon to do
a job any corporal could take care of

  hanks face betrayed nothing of his
thoughts

  i am quite aware lieutenant that
you had your own regiment during the
late war and that you were my com-
manding officer for a brief period how-
ever so long as you command even a
platoon in my regiment you will obey
my orders is that clear

  donahue glared back at him for a
moment saluted and wheeled his horse
back down the line

  mister braggel continued the
colonel your platoon will act as escort
for mr donahues wagons

  mister dupuy on your patrol this
morning did you approach any settlers
cabins 

  the william eubanks place sir

  wrould you say mister that the smoke
bride of the tomahawk pack



over there on my left is the approximate
location of this settlers cabin

  i would sir

  then take your platoon mister and
investigate that smoke engage the sav-
ages if they are about the regiment will
follow behind you shortly but not too
close to frighten the cheyenne ques-
tions 

  no sir

  as lee rode back to rejoin his platoon
he saw the colonel staring motionless at
the column of smoke

  at a gallop forward-ho com-
manded lee

  the platoon wheeled out of the column
behind him and followed as they rode up
the crest of a hill beside the trail lee
paused and whipped the platoon past him
with his riding quirt the regiment was
still waiting quietly where they had left
them and at the rear of the blue column
braggels platoon was galloping off in a
cloud of dust behind donahue to meet
the two burial wagons

  lee slipped his spencer carbine out of
his saddle boot and snapped it on his belt
it was nore uncomfortable riding that
way but he wanted the weapon where it
was most accessible he put three scouts
forward and one on each flank being
the bait he reflected didnt necessarily
mean being expendable material

  at the last ridge after hard riding the
scouts on the forward point called a halt
to the platoon and lee rode up front to
have a look across the stump land the
eubanks cabin was a mass of still burn-
ing ruins

  what do you think lee asked a
scout

  they just cleared out of there a
minute ago lieutenant and they knew
we were coming see that track he
pointed to a fresh hoof print of an un-
shod indian pony into which the sand was
still sifting

  his gaze followed the direction of the
track and lee noticed at the edge of the
path a bush which was gently rocking
although the air was still

  hes probably sitting up there right
now watching us lee said he didnt
like the looks of it sanchez he called

  the platoon sergeant with the butt of
his spencer resting on his hip and the

muzzle in the air rode up

  theyre all around us lieutenant you
cant see them but you can feel them

  i know but were going in have the
men carry their carbines at a half-cock

  lee waited until the platoon came up
to him then pointing forward he led
them down at a fast gallop

  keep your eyes open he yelled

  the cavalry raced across the stump land
pulled up sharply before the burning
cabin and lee leaped from his saddle

  sanchez he screamed two men
out behind us two ahead of us get a
man up on both of those ridges there i
want cover all around

  the platoon sergeant barked his orders
sharply designating men and putting out
the scouts

  knowing well that the non-com would
take all the necessary precautions lee
turned his attention toward the burning
cabin there was a strange quietness
about it marred only by the crackling of
the logs or a collapse of wood when it
burned out

  he found will eubank lying under a
dead cheyenne with several arrows in
his body he had been stripped of his
clothing scalped and his beard hacked
off

  two of the eulank children had been
swung by their heels and brained against
the wall of the cabin but the oldest child
a girl who had been unfortunate enough
to wear long blond hair had been scalped

  mrs eubanks body had been dragged
away from the cabin site to the edge of
the field evidently she had been captured
alive

  sergeant sanchez better organize a
burial squad the eubanks would want
to remain right here on their own land
said lee wearily he took a blanket from
his saddle roll and wrapped mrs eu-
banks body before bringing it back be-
fore his troopers

  little bear has gone crazy lieu-
tenant he never raided this close to
fort dodge before said sanchez

  hes awfully sure that cheyenne lance
will keep his tribe safe

  the rustling noise made by the wind
blowing through the pine trees surround-
ing the clearing was interrupted by a
shout from a scout posted not far from


indian stories

the cabin lee looked curiously at san-
chez cocked his spencer carbine and
walked over to where the scout stood

  sprawled on a thick brown carpet of
pine needles they saw a sixth stripped
and mutilated body

  it was the colonels lady mary hanks

iv

cover that up ordered lee

  vthe scout brought up a blanket
from his saddle and tied it around the
body when they turned back to the burn-
ing cabin another trooper approached lee

  lieutenant that ridge up there is
alive with cheyenne i could hear them
crawling in the brush around me and
their horses were pretty noisy

  will they attack us said a trooper
 standing in a trench behind lee

  lee turned around and found that the
question came from cooke who was busy
shoveling a grave for the eubanks

   yes theyll attack all right this place
 wont be so healthy for us in a few
 minutes well have to fight on foot and
 the cheyenne will have the advantage of
 firing from the ridge

  cant we get out of here persisted
 cooke

  our orders were to engage the indians
 if they were around interrupted san-
 chez his face betrayed his unexpressed
 contempt for cooke

  i want a man to take a message back
to colonel hanks

   ill go said cooke dropping his shovel

  the cheyenne may have gone around
behind us and cut off the trail by now
you may not be any safer there than we
are here sneered sanchez

  cooke whitened

  tell colonel hanks what we found
here and that the cheyenne are going to
attack us tell the colonel that we have
recovered the body of his wife

  the trooper shot a startled glance at
 the bundle on the ground he took a
 step toward it paused then went to mount
 his horse

   that all sir

  yes get going

   cooke spurred the mount fast across the
 stump land and in a minute was out of
 sight among the pines

  he was damned eager to get out of a
fight lieutenant said sanchez bitterly
some one had to go sergeant

  cooke got away safely down the trail
the sound of the hoofbeats of his horse
had just died away over the ridge when
from the timber in the opposite direction
broke a fusillade of shots lee turned
quickly and saw a thin line of blue-white
smoke hanging about the edge of the
woods

  here they come screamed sanchez
get down

  as skirmishers commanded lee
pulling his saber and directing his troopers
up on a firing line a few of the spencers
carbines were already returning the chey-
enne fire in short sharp barks

  sanchez called lee get a skirmish
line at our rear

  a dozen troopers fell back to protect
the platoons rear and flanks lee felt
more secure once he heard sanchez direct-
ing the firing of a line of kneeling and
prone troopers on the other side of the
burning cabin

  he could see in the trees at the edge of
the wood the cheyenne slipping about like
shadows and firing off their single-shot
muskets a few of the braves had crept
in across the stump land and were using
the protecting cover of the cut tree trunks
to snipe at close range the clearing was
a din of barking spencers and exploding
muskets

  after a few minutes a group of moun-
ted braves appeared at the edge of the
wood to tempt the cavalrymen to fire in
volleys

  youre in for a cold shock little
bear thought lee to himself at
powder river we had only the old single-
shot springfields youve never seen a
seven-shot spencer carbine have you
lieutenant interrupted sanchez
the platoon only has fourteen cartridges
per carbine the men didnt get a chance
to load up their bandoleers when we failed
to meet the supply train from laramie
i know said lee well just have to
fight a holding action until cooke can get
to colonel hanks

  the mounted braves were running their
horses up and down at the edge of the
clearing

  now shouted lee in volleys
bride of the tomahawk pack	

fire

  the carbines rattled off a line of fire
and were silent thinking that the soldiers
would have to stop and reload their
weapons the cheyenne braves came pour-
ing out of the woods like water over a
broken dike

  hold your fire until i say shouted
lee

  he could see little bear at the head
of the cheyenne astride an indian pony
brandishing his steel lance and shouting
the indians came howling across the
stump land mounted and on foot yelling
and firing their muskets

  now fire commanded lee

  another sheet of red barked from the
spencers and in the charging cheyenne
band a dozen braves leading the attack
stumbled and fell little bears pony
reared up on its hind legs and the half-
breed war chief had a hard time reorgan-
izing his attack in a moment he had
the indians remassed and screaming and
charging again

  fire shouted lee a third time and
a fourth and a fifth time and the ranks
of the cheyenne wavered thinned and at
last broke the white smoke and the smell
of gun powder hung heavily over the
clearing

   a corporal with a musket ball in his neck
crawled away from the skirmish line

  im almost out of cartridges called
a trooper as he pulled out his revolver

  me too shouted one of his saddle
mates

  shut up commanded lee that half-
breed speaks english he looked toward
the stump land where the cheyenne were
dragging their wounded into the woods
little bear was still mounted on his pony
directing his braves with his glistening
lance from the trees the indians kept up
a glistering fire from their muskets and
some braves worked in close to rain ar-
rows down on the line of blue coats about
the burning cabin

  how many did we lose sergeant
asked lee to sanchez who was trying to
stop the blood from the wounded corporal

  tins man with a ball in his throat
sir and two dead but we cant break up
another charge like that one

  i know lee replied then to the
troopers he called the regiment will be

here in a few minutes so hold your fire
until youre sure of a target

  occasionally the bark of a cavalry car-
bine replied to the steady sputtering of
the cheyenne muskets lead balls smacked
dully into the logs about the troopers and
kicked up dirt in their faces the cavalrymen
carefully watched the feathered arrows as
they arched gently up from the pine woods
and dropped down on the blue line

  suddenly the cheyenne firing ceased
and the troopers began to mutter among
themselves

  what the hell sir asked sanchez

   as if in reply a voice shouted from the
edge of the woods coats-of-blue hear
me your brothers the buffalo soldiers are
dead at the hands of the crazy dogs
their horses killed and their rolling tepees
burned you have seen them and you
have seen yourselves as you will be

  already your muskets are hungry for
powder your lead is gone i know these
things to be because i have heard you
crying among yourselves like the women
of my lodges hear me coats-of-blue
fire a volley whispered lee

  a ragged discharge of carbines exploded
anew in the clearing and was met by
silence from the woods lee rising to his
knees cupped his hands to his mouth and
called listen o little bear are the
coats-of-blue muskets hungry now for
powder ask of the brave cheyenne
who lie dead on the field if the
coats-of-blue muskets hungry now for
ask your dog soldiers to follow
you again o little bear and count for
yourself how many warriors will ride to
the happy hunting ground this hour little
bear is not a warrior he is a squaw-man
fit only for the womens lodges he who
lifts the scalps of squaws

  ayee screamed the half-breed in a
rage he dashed out of the woods on his
pony with lance in hand stood in the
clearing in easy range of the cavalry sol-
diers and calmly fired a shot from his
musket at them a troopers spencer
barked a reply at him but the shot went
wild into the trees as the indian disap-
peared again

fft ittle bear shouted lee again

m-j hear me o squaw-chief the
woman which vou have this day captured
	indian

is the squaw of a powerful chief of the
coats-of-blue surrender her little bear
and take your people back to your reserva-
tion and become once again the great
leader of cheyenne that you were sur-
render her little bear or from this day
forward suffer the coats-of-blue will
drive you from the plains into the moun-
tains of canada and the cheyenne will
die of the cold and starvation and his
people will say of little bear that he was
a lustful and foolish chief to bring this
misery on them

  immediately a sputtering of musketry
broke from the timber and again the in-
dians swarmed out of the woods for an-
other attack lee could see little bear
stripped naked now screaming and work-
ing himself into a frenzy as he drove his
braves into the attack

  hold your fire warned lee

  the indians charging in mass were
only two hundred yards away now and
a nervous trooper discharged his spencer

  hold until i say commanded lee
tensely he slipped his revolver from his
holster and cocked it in his belt now
dont let them inside the perimeter
fire

  a dozen braves went down and little
bears horse stumbled and threw him to
the ground but he quickly caught another
and mounted the indians charged the last
distance which separated them from the
blue line

  fire shouted lee again but the sav-
ages were already on top of them and
the volley lost its effectiveness little bear
leaped his pony inside the broken defenses
and ran his lance through the corporal
who had been wounded in the first charge
the troopers met the gieyenne in hand
to hand duels sabers against tomahawks
pistols against war clubs and lances here
and there a carbine fired its final shot
and its owner dug at his side for his saber

  lee kneeling beside the burning cabin
shot a brave from his pony and kept try-
ing to bring his pistol down on little
bear who was a frenzy of action in the
midst of the fighting-shouting stabbing
hacking jabbing and screaming from his
horse a cheyenne on foot attempted to
rush the officer with upraised tomahawk
but lee side-stepped and dropped the sav-
age with a back hand stroke of his blade

stories

into the painted face

  lee was carefully counting the shots
from his pistol

  save the last one

  suddenly from the distance came the
clear notes of the bugle blowing the cavalry
charge and for a brief instant the fighting
in the clearing stopped while troopers and
indians alike listened

  then little bear gave a cry and the
cheyenne braves went running back into
the woods from where they had come lee
killed another warrior who stopped to lift
the scalp of a wounded trooper but by
the time the first scouts appeared over
the top of the ridge the clearing was
vacant of living cheyenne

  here comes the third cried a
trooper and a general shout went up from
lees weary platoon troop after troop of
cavalry galloped by and on into the timber
in pursuit of the cheyenne dog soldiers
colonel hanks party stopped by the re-
mains of the cabin

  lt dupuy he called from his horse
  yes sir

how many men did you lose mister
five killed sir everyone got rustled
up a bit the cheyenne broke through
our perimeter defense we were about fin-
ished when the regiment got here

  little bear

  yes sir hes pretty bold colonel
there were about three hundred of them
another band must have left the reserva-
tion to join him

  they did mister the regimental
scouts found the trail of another cheyenne
party i was afraid theyd try to join
little bear

  hes still got captain lonnigans
daughter sir

  i know mister hes probably sent
her back to old chief american dog the
jscouts know the location of his camp back
on the reservation but little bear would
never let us take her by force

  no sir

  well mister get your wounded on
their horses well go back to fort
dodge

  bury the eubanks here sir

  yes said the officer coldly and well
take the body of mrs hanks back with
us

  yes sir replied lee with carefully
bride of the tomahawk pack	

averted eyes

  where is that trooper you sent to
me asked the colonel as if he had
suddenly remembered something

  cooke summoned dupuy

  the soldier came up behind depuy and
saluted

  i want you to take a message to lieu-
tenants donahue and braggel over on the
bozeman trail where the supply wagons
were attacked yesterday said the colonel

  ive run my mount pretty hard sir
when i reported to you said cooke dully

  hanks gave him a freezing glare

  you will tell them that the regiment
is returning to fort dodge and that they
are to follow with the burial wagons as
soon as possible i dont want them out
there alone since little bear has gone
wild

  wouldnt it be better sir to send a
troop to escort them in replied cooke

  dupuy knew what was coming and at-
tempted to focus his attention back on his
platoon

  lieutenant said hanks sharply i
want you to hear this dupuy turned back
to face the colonel

  cooke said hanks ignoring dupuy
i order you to take that message to the
burial wagons and should you refuse ill
have you court martialed for cowardice
in the face of the enemy do you under-
stand that

  cooke looked helplessly at dupuy then
mounted his horse

  that all colonel hanks

  that is all trooper said the colonel
as he returned his salute he didnt turn
to look as cooke galloped out of the clear-
ing

  mister dupuy he said instruct the
bugler to sound recall well never capture
that slippery half-breed devil by force

v

night fell over fort dodge like
a sober dark canopy the music and
laughter which had been so prevalent in
the enlisted barracks only the night before
had been considerably lessened with the
coming of a new indian campaign

  in the pegimental headquarters adja-
cent to colonel hanks quarters a light
burned brightly inside the plainly furn-

ished room the officers of the regiment sat
stiffly with sabers straight at their sides
listening to the commandant as he out-
lined on a large wall marked territory of
wyoming the movements of the cheyenne
war party

  in brief gentlemen this is it said
colonel hanks pointing with a cane reed
little bears band of crazy dogs is small
and mobile enough to keep one jump ahead
of us if we use the regiment as a compact
unit and hell never fight where he
doesnt outnumber us five to one

  lee seated on a slab bench in the rear
of the room stretched his long legs before
him and regarded his dusty boots with
a bored disinterest

  where are donahue and braggel

  he cleared his throat and listened to
the dull droning of hanks voice

   for a man who just this day lost his be-
loved wife to the indians you seem
damned composed colonel

  always bear in mind that while little
bear is an uneducated savage he is still
a brilliant strategist

  you west pointers all play at war like
it was a checker game human life doesnt
mean much to you as long as you win your
battles and get your glory

  a lack of education is not stupidity
gentlemen also remember that little bear
is half white-man-as white as any one
of us and half cheyenne his mother was
a frontier woman captured frotn a wagon
train passing through here long before
fort dodge was founded his father was
then a chief of the cheyenne

  how does this help to get back irish
lonnigan and what good does it do to
bring all this up before captain lonnigan 
why tell him whats in store for his
daughter

  when we tried using the regiment
against him he out-maneuvered us when
we tried to trap him with a single platoon
he stole the bait nearly wiped out the pla-
toon and got away now well have to
fight his way-with cunning and diplo-
macy

  you seem about as diplomatic colonel
as a herd of bull buffalo in a thunder
storm if you had any brains youd lav a
whip across the pretty brown back of your
indian girl friend for taking those two
women outside the stockade this morning


indian stories

shes cheyenne herself and it was you
who said you couldnt trust a cheyenne-
even a half-breed cheyenne

  what i had in mind was sending a
messenger to the old chief american dog
granting permission to those of his braves
who want to leave the reservation to join
the southern cheyenne on the war path
in colorado

  in return for letting them leave the
territory the messenger will tell american
dog that the white girl captain lonni-
gans daughter must be returned to us
and secondly the braves who want to
leave the reservation must follow a route
marked by the soldiers well trap them
in one of those box canyons south of here
and break the backbone of the cheyennes
power once and for all little bear will
be suspicious but old american dog trusts
us and hes their chief

  how noble colonel

  colonel hanks interrupted captain
lonnigan rising to his feet im anxious
to have my daughter safely returned but
id hesitate to risk the lives of more men
unnecessarily

  soldiers know the risks when they en-
list in this regiment captain

  just the same sir if we could send
word to american dog by one of their own
people-perhaps that cheyenne serving
girl who is employed in your quarters
suggested lonnigan

  lee smiled you smacked him with both
barrels that time

  i could not consider sending a woman
to do a soldiers duty sir said hanks
stiffly

  i suppose not sir replied the irish-
man innocently

  i believe that lt donahue would be
right for the job he directed the com-
mission that went to sign the treaty with
american dog last year after the powder
river campaign i think that lt dupuy
was also a number of that party said
hanks then raising his voice is that
right lieutenant

  lee bolted upright on the bench

  yes sir

  by the w-ay lieutenant where is lieu-
tenant donahue when i sound officers
call in this regiment i mean to have all
my officers present whether theyve just
come of duty or not

he hasnt come off duty sir he and
lt braggel havent come in with the burial
wagons detail replied lee

 hanks looked puzzled then startled

 they should have come in hours ago
 he said juarez

 yes sir replied the striker standing
 up at the rear of the room

go to troop c barracks and have
trooper cooke report to me immediately

 yes sir his boots sounded heavily
 across the wood planks as he ran out

i wondered when youd get around to
missing them colonel its slow traveling
with those two wagons and youd better
send a troop to escort them in

 colonel hanks feeling that he had blun-
 dered before his command stood silently
 waiting in front of the officers of the regi-
 ment

in a few minutes the mexican striker
returned with cooke

cooke stepped into the room glanced
about him suspiciously at the officers and
saluted colonel hanks silently

 is that the way you report to an officer
 soldier snapped harks with hands
 clasped behind him

 no sir

lee was embarrassed for the man and
somewhere in the room another officer
coughed nervously

well demanded hanks his feet
planted far apart his head thrust forward
in raging at cooke he thereby relieved
some of his own embarrassment concerning
the burial wagons

private cooke reports to the com-
manding officer as directed sir said
cooke aggressively

hanks returned his salute smartly
thats better he growled which of-
ficer did you report to at the burial wagons
today 

 lt donahue sir said cooke blandly

what did he say

 he said he would start as soon as   
 as soon as the burial wagons were loaded

you are sure

 yes sir

did you see any signs of the chey-
enne

cooke paused yes sir a big scalp
party they were carrying their wounded
from the battle at the cabin i hid in a
bride of the tomahawk pack	

 timber coppice and watched them ride over
 a hill 

  in front of you

  again cooke stumbled no sir just
near me on my left flank

  before you reported to lt donahue
glared hanks

  yes sir mumbled cooke

  speak up damn it

  yes sir

  and you reported to donahue that the
cheyenne were moving in his direction
yes sir

  what did he say

  he ordered out scouts

  how is it that you didnt stay with
that detail instead of coming back to the
fort alone especially when you knew that
there were indians about

  i didnt think of it sir i delivered
my message and came back

  hanks glared at the trooper mister
dupuy said the colonel coldly without
taking his eyes from cooke fail out your
platoon and ride out to meet the two wa-
gons

  thats right colonel give the dirty
work to my troopers theyve only been
in their saddles since last night

  yes sir said lee aloud he saluted
and stepped outside the night was bright
and warm and clear he could see the yel-
low lights burning in windows all over the
post

  suddenly from the stockade a voice
sang out hoarsely corporal of the guard
main gate

  two shots from a spencer cut the night
and echoed over the post

  corporal of the guard main gate
the cry was repeated from post to post
and from the direction of the stockade gate
lee could hear excited voices

  a number of officers led by the colonel
himself appeared in the doorway of regi-
mental headquarters and peered out
curiously lee heard the creaking of the
big woden gate as it opened and the sound
of a group of horsemen riding into the
stockade

  just a minute lieutenant called
hanks i believe that must be the burial
wagons coming in now

  with a clattering of hoofs the horsemen
cut sharply around the enlisted barracks
and reined-up before regimental lee saw

that it was don braggel who was leading
the men

  colonel hanks called braggel breath-
lessly cheyenne jumped us

  hanks pounded his fist against the walls
of the building and charged out of the
doorway with an oath

  where mister speak up

  hells basin sir breathed braggel
heavily same place lost lt donahue
how many men

  just us left sir we hid out until night
fall before coming on in

  hanks counted the horsemen twelve
he said twelve out of thirty-two

  lee helped braggel down from his horse
his yellow kerchief was stained a bright
red from a cut on his forehead

  alright you men bellowed hanks
youre dismissed report over to the
infirmary if any of you are hurt

  the troopers began leading their mounts
across the parade field lee helped sup-
port braggel into the light of the regi-
mental headquarters

  juarez bring a doctor from the in-
firmary for the lieutenant directed
hanks

  braggel was propped up against the
wall while someone unbuttoned his tunic
he looked extremely young with his hair
matted about his forehead

  alright mister said hanks let
me have your report

  braggel took a drink of brandy from
a flask which someone had handed him
and licked his lips the regimental sur-
geon pushed his way through the group
of officers and looked at the cut on the
boys forehead

  well sir began braggel we got
the two wagons loaded and we waited
in the middle of the afternoon ouch
that hurts one of my flank scouts came
in and said that a big party of cheyenne
were heading toward us lt donahue was
afraid we wouldnt have time to get out of
the basin before the indians got there so
we pulled up the wagons in a perimeter
defense and waited for the regiment to
come back for us take it easy doctor
that cut burns we waited all after-
noon in the hot sun the scouts kept see-
ing signs of the indians above us along
the rim of the basin but we werent at-
tacked
	indian

  about four oclock we decided to make
a run for it to high ground we split
the platoon and i took half of it with
the first wagon and donahue lt dona-
hue sir took the rest with his wagon
they came down on top of us as soon
as we broke the perimeter-about three
hundred of them

  they cut off the second wagon from
us sir and started circling around and
around and the troopers dismounted and
fought on foot we ran our wagon into
the pines at the top of the basin and
spread out to defend ourselves but they
didnt rush us

  they began circling around and around
the other wagon and shooting and the
troopers were shooting back in volleys
and after a few minutes the spencers
werent shooting back as often the chey-
enne tightened their circle and rode in
among them and they captured five or six
of the soldiers-i think lt donahue was
one of them sir they tied them on the
wagon wheels and we could hear them
screaming it was awful sir

  all right mister

  when it got dark we led our horses
through the pines and got away i sup-
pose the indians have found our other
wagon by now

  why didnt you leave the place as soon
as you had loaded your wagons lieu-
tenant 

  your orders were to wait there for
the return of the regiment sir

  hanks grabbed the surgeons hand as
he was bandaging braggels head

  what about the messenger i sent
you he demanded

  he must have been caught by the in-
dians sir

  hanks stood and stared at cooke the
trooper stood with his back to the wall
his face pale his lips set in a thin line

  no replied hanks coldly the in-
dians didnt get him hed been better
off if they had

  cooke didnt answer

  the messenger saw the indian party
heading in your direction lieutenant and
he thought the wagons would be wiped
out anyway so why should he risk hs
neck

  cooke smiled faintly

  juarez go get the officer of the

stories

guard ordered the colonel i have a
prisoner for him

  the room was silent

  trooper said hanks spacing his
words evenly his eyes burning at cooke
im going to have you shot

vi

   ee rode straight down the narrow
 trail looking neither to his right nor
his left walking his horse and watching
his shadow gliding along beneath him

  what else could you do but come don-
ahue is dead-eagle spread and burned
on a wagon wheel he couldnt come and
someone had to do it  go colonel i
was a member of lt donahues commis-
sion that went to american dog last year
he knows me i might get through to
him sir what else could you- do f lonni-
gan looked as if hed hug your neck

  with the mid-day sun burning down
on him lee mopped his wet forehead
with the yellow kerchief about his neck
and looked up at the smoke which arose
from the camp fires on the reservation
just over the hill

  a single shot echoed out of the pines
and crashed into the rocks a few feet
ahead of his horse lee didnt stop

  keep riding hes only testing keep
riding dont appear to notice it

  presently an indian chieftain rode out
of the woods ahead of him then was
followed by a line of mounted horsemen
the cheyenne stood silently in the trail
waiting

  dressed in only a bright breech cloth
with a spencer carbine captured from
one of lt donahues men slung across
the blanket saddle in front of him a huge
blue-eyed indian held up his arm and
blocked lees way

  in his hand the cheyenne held a glis-
tening th century spanish lance it
was the rebel war chief little bear

  lee stopped his horse before the sav-
ages they stood staring at him bellig-
erently

  peace brothers said lee lifting his
right hand i bring word to american
dog the great cheyenne chief

  the indians regarded him in stony si-
lence

  after a minute little bear said without
bride of the tomahawk pack



changing expression the coat-of-blue
comes whispering peace to his brothers
but wears his pistol forward

  he grunted a command in cheyenne
to three braves who rode forward and
snatched lees pistol and saber from him
he had left his carbine behind to keep
it from falling into little bears hands

  easy easy now dont change expres-
sion youre dead if he sees youre scared
let them have the pistol you still got
your derringer in your boot

  gladly i surrender my arms to my
cheyenne brothers so that they may know
i come to them as a friend with words
which the crazy dog society have long
awaited

  the coat-of-blue has presents for
the cheyenne

  the cheyenne are not squaws or chil-
dren they do not need presents like
crows the gift which the coat-of-blue
brings is in his words for american dog
little bear went into a rapid conver-
sation with his braves while lee pretended
to wait impatiently

  too bad you dont understand chey-
enne you cant ever tell what these mon-
keys are up to-not by their faces their
expressions never change you could cut
ones leg off and his face would never
tell you what he was thinking

  suddenly little bear swung his heavy
lance around in a wide circle catching lee
in the back of the neck and sending him
tumbling out of his saddle two braves
hurled themselves on him before he had
recovered from the blow and lashed his
wrists together behind him

  one of the cheyenne warriors stooped
down and pulled off lees heavy cavalry
boots and the tiny derringer tumbled
out the warrior picked up the pistol
examined it suspiciously then struck lee
across the face with his riding quirt
little bear tossed a lariat down over
the young officers neck and jerked him
roughly to his feet

  go commanded the savage

  almost an hour later having run stum-
bled and been dragged with feet bloody
and bruised behind the indian ponies over
the rocky trail lee found himself in the
camp of american dog surrounded by
hundreds of restless cheyenne little bear

-indian stories-winter

broke the horses into a gallop once inside
the camp and lee was dragged half-un-
conscious in a cloud of dust past several
skin lodges while the squaws ran out
screaming to kick at him and throw stones

  as he was half-carried half-dragged
into a lodge lee was struck by the heavy
odor of animal fat and sweating human
bodies which came from inside american
dog the old cheyenne chief sat on a
pile of skins surrounded by a group of
his painted braves

  lee was pitched forward into the dust
at the old chiefs feet he could barely
make out the forms crowding in about
him and he heard the indians in the room
speaking in cheyenne and above the other
he could distinguish the clear familiar
voice of a woman talking to the old chief

  his head cleared as quickly as a plunge
into cold water lee looked up

  the colonels house girl-pearl white
feathers of course

  lee looked at the indian girl

  in an unfettered free manner she was
attractive enough her eyes mere shafts
of light had a way of darting about in
contempt

  behold him old chief said the half-
breed girl for lees benefit in english
it is as i have told you the chief of
the coats-of-blue sends one of his war-
riors with a false message he speaks
with a forked tongue as a snake if you
listen to his words cheyenne will die
heed the counsel of my brother little
bear the war chief and we will slay many
of the coats-of-blue are the cheyenne to
become rabbits to flee before the falcons
are the cheyenne without pride to bear
the insults of the whites as do the co-
wardly crows

  american dog looked at lee solemnly

  i know this warrior he said we
have met on the field of blood and have
smoked together the pipe of peace in the
lodges he is a brave man and a friend
of the cheyenne

  three cheers for american dog he
remembers you from powder river

  listen to him listen to him o chief
hear his words hear the message he
brings and see that it is as i have told
you

  good work pearl wouldnt the col-
onel like to know that his little indian

stories

playmate was telling his plans to the chey-
enne as fast as he made them and you
must have had a time getting him to talk
old girl fort laramie would like to hear
about that theyd court martial old matt
so fast he wouldnt know what hit him

  american dog motioned to a brave to
free lees hands and sat-back and waited
for him to speak

  it is not as this squaw says o brave
american dog in your lodges there are
greedy braves who would take the power
of the cheyenne from you the council of
your war chief will leave the war trail
slick with the wet blood of cheyenne do
not listen to them o chief they will
bring your tribe misery and hunger not
glory or scalps

pearl screamed an abuse at lee
and scooping up a handful of dust
threw it into his eyes american dog
watched without expression and listened
as the girl broke into an excited cheyenne
in a moment he waved her silent with a
motion of his hand and indicated that
lee would continue

  what words does the chief of the coats-
of-blue send to the cheyenne he asked

  he sends to his brothers a message of
peace and bids me tell american dog the
great chief that the white girl prisoner
must be surrendered

  here pearl translated something to the
cheyenne braves who muttered angrily
among themselves

  he sends word to aemrican dog that
those of the crazy dog society who want
to join their brothers in the lands to the
south may leave their reservation unop-
posed by the coats-of-blue  if they
travel the trail to the west through the
canyon which the cheyenne call broken
arrow

  lies screamed pearl is it not as i
have said wise american dog this one
speaks with a forked tongue from the
lips of his own chief have i heard the
true words the coats-of-blue wait there
in ambush to slay the cheyenne

  little bear who had been standing
quietly at the side of the old man touched
his arm and spoke in a rapid cheyenne
gesturing as he talked with a downward
motion of his fingers

  american dog replied to him in chey-

enne and the war chief picked up his
spencer carbine and strode out of the
lodge

  there is dissension in my tribe said
american dog in his broken english i
have sent the warrior little bear to see
who has spoken the true words - this
squaw or this coat-of-blue until he re-
turns the coat-of-blue will stay here
american dog turning away from lee
indicated that the interview was over
several cheyenne braves seized lee
bound his hands again and pushed him
out into the blinding sunlight a crowd
of children and squaws who had been
waiting rushed at him with whips and
stones and he protected his face with
his arms until his captors could take him
inside a second lodge near by the braves
kept the squaws back while they tied lees
hands above his head to a wooden shaft
which ran along the ceiling of the hut
he was conscious of another figure tied
up behind him but did not turn around
until the braves had gone out of the
lodge and secured a hide covering over
the entrance behind them

  he turned in the darkness and peered
at the second figure in the hut probably
some poor crow they picked up to give
the fire treatment he figured

  you speak english said lee

 there was a pause and a womans
voice replied have you come to rescue
me please

  miss lonnigan miss irish is that
you this is lt dupuy from the fort
can you see me

  yes i can see you have you come for
me or have they captured you sir how
is my father

  hes fine miss i saw him before i
left this morning and he says to tell you
that the regiment is doing everything
possible to get you back home ive come
to bargain with american dog have
they harmed you

  the girl was making a sobbing noise
and lee waited for her to speak

  the old chief has kept the men away
from me the women are terrible
though she said

  the squaws are always the worst

  i know it was that cheyenne girl who
works for colonel hanks that gave us
to the indians they were waiting in the
bride of the tomahawk pack



woods and she drove the wagon right up
to them

  pearl white feathers she was with
the old chief just now

  pearl yes thats the one the pretty
girl she tricked us and the indians took
us away with them once they tied us
up so we couldnt cry out when some
cavalry rode by very close to where we
were hiding near a cabin

  that was my platoon wed just left
the eubanks place and were on our way
back to dodge

  afterwards they attacked the log cabin
they made us wait on a ridge while the
braves went creeping up there were
some children playing in the yard with a
dog and a man working in the garden
beside the house

  that was will

  the indians slipped in close and then
they went charging down on the man
shooting their guns and the man killed
one of them before he fell down then
their leader stuck him with his lance and
they all rode around and shot arrows into
him

  why did they kill mrs hanks asked
lee

  when the shooting was over the in-
dians took us down to the cabin and there
were those poor little children-

  i know

 and the mother was crying and
screaming and they started to drag her
off into the field and mrs hanks-the
colonels lady-made her horse jump for-
ward and rode over to where they held
her she struck and beat at them until
the leader pulled her off her horse and i
shut my eyes and wouldnt listen and
they did those awful things   

  she was silent again lee knew she was
crying

  so it was little bear youll hang for
that you half-breed savage

  itll all be over soon you wont have
to think about it in a few days well be
safely back at dodge

  fat chance of that when little bear
comes back and tells the old chief that
you tried to waltz him into an ambush
hell roast you and the girl both and if
the regiment tried to take this place by
frontal assault the cheyenne would simply
pull out and leave you behind with a

tomahawk in your skull

  in a few minutes the hide covering the
entrance was lifted and pearl white
feathers slipped in lee eyed her coldly

  the indian girl removed a sharpened
cane reed from her belt and jabbed lee
in the side 

  he flinched land the wire of pain pen-
etrated to the very pit of his stomach he
clamped his teeth tightly together

  what is she going to do lieutenant
asked irish lonnigan anxiously from be-
hind him lee didnt answer

  soldier said pearl brave soldier
kill many cheyenne yes brave war-
rior brave yes she jabbed lee with
the pointed reed

  lee kept turning in- ai attempt to keep
away from her and she followed him
around stabbing at him with short thrusts

  in a minute he stopped twisting and
hung by his wrists and took it until he
fainted

vii

at dawn the next morning a shout-
ing in the cheyenne camp announced
the return of little bears scouting party
lee who had been dozing fitfully on his
bruised feet awakened with a start and
turned to face irish lonnigan she was
standing patiently behind him

  are you awake he asked

  yes are you all right i was afraid
that horrible girl would kill you

  i only passed out

  what is all that noise outside
little bear has probably returned from
broken arrow canyon colonel hanks
tried to lure the cheyenne into a trap
there and little bear went to scout ahead
hes a foxy bird if some of his dog
soldiers can engage the regiment at
broken arrow the rest of the cheyenne
can slip through the east passage colonel
hanks doesnt have enough troops to hold
both passages

  what will american dog do when he
finds out the colonel tried to trick him
lee didnt answer

  us questioned irish lonnigan she
was a very brave girl

  im afraid so replied lee

  i was going to be married soon

  i know it might help to talk about it
take your mind off tilings
indian stories



  no it wont help nothing will help
how will they do it

  i dont know lied lee

  i hope i can be brave said irish
  dont think about it miss

  she tried not to but it was no good for
her

  after a while lee bedame accustomed
to the noise in the camp and a group of
indians appeared before the lodge in
which their two prisoners were being held
lee waited uneasily for them to enter
and the sweat ran cold down his sides

  american dog stepped into the lodge
followed by little bear and several of
his braves dressed in a full eagle-feather
war bonnet which dragged in the dust
behind him the old chief was magnificent
he looked coldly at lee

  the coat-of-blue has lied he said
simply

  if it is not as i have told you o
chief then i have been tricked

  thy brothers line the walls of the
broken arrow like the leaves of a tree
and their silver shoots-a-heap would slay
the cheyenne

  hell he must be talking about a gatling
gun

  not so my father the coats-of-blue
are the brothers of the cheyenne it is
your chiefs who would force us to raise
our rifles against your braves

  american dog motioned him silent
the cheyenne are not children to be
fooled said the old man we are war-
riors and brave this hour i leave with
my tribe for the passage to the east
where the coats-of-blue do not look for
us i will lead my people to the lands to
the south where the buffalo run free and
the cheyenne can live as they did in the
days before the coming of the white
men

  the coats-of-blue will follow you to
the east passage american dog

  no little bear will attack them when
the sun is high tomorrow and will keep
the coats-of-blue from finding my people
until i have lead them safely away the
trap which the hunter has prepared for
the hares will catch nothing

  youre probably right old boy if little
bear can create a diversion with his dog
soldiers at broken arrow old matt will
think hes got the whole cheyenne tribe

bottled up

  pearl white feathers entered the lodge
through the skin doonvay and confronted
american dog

  what of these prisoners mighty chief
do not their scalps belong to little bear
who has captured them name the hour
of their deaths

  american dog scooped up a hand full of
dust from the floor of the hutment and
let it sift through his fingers

  when the sun is above the lodges of
the cheyenne he said and the shadows
are shortest

  noon thought lee to himself

  the indian party went out silently
again and lee turned to face irish lon-
nigan the girl was white and tense

  in a few minutes he heard the sound of
horses outside and shouting and all the
noise and clamor that accompanies an in-
dian tribe as it breaks camp and he knew
that american dog was leading out his
tribe to the east passage

  there goes the old chief with his
tribe said lee breaking a long silence
in the lodge only little bears dog
soldiers are left in camp

  irish didnt reply but looked curiously
at a smoke hole in the top of the skin
lodge lee followed her gaze and his
eyes fell on a patch of sunlight streaming
through the opening and falling on the
group in the center of the lodge

  noon

  little bear followed by a group of his
painted crazy dogs came into the lodge
presently

  ho here comes the great squaw-chief
little bear exclaimed lee with forced
bravado he who lifts the scalps of
prisoners a crow who lives in the
womens lodges

  little bear rage flashing in his blue
eyes struck lee with a riding quirt his
face was a mask of anger

  crow woman little bear is not a
man are his squaws heavy with cubs
nay his squaws laugh at him and stray
from his lodge like loose mares the
leader of the crazy dog society hunts
only rabbit and bird would he dare to
enter the cave of the mountain lion or
stalk the grizzley bear among the rocks
nay would he dare to challenge a great
warrior of the blue coats nay instead he
bride of the tomahawk pack



would burn the blue-coat and his fear
would make his hand to tremble

  little bear had his hands at lees
throat and he spoke hotly in his face

  coat-of-blue would you dare to meet
a chief of the crazy dogs

  he turned angrily and spoke to the dog
soldiers in cheyenne and lee listened
quitely

  he took it if you can get their attention
long enough the girl can slip away if
hell only fight the half-breed devil

  the indians approached their two
prisoners untied them and led them out-
side into the sunlight there was shouting
and talking among the crazy dogs and
lee knew that the word was circulating
among the tribesmen little bear was to
duel the coat-of-blue the cheyenne came
leading a group of ponies and lee in-
dicated that he would ride his army
mount

  irish lonnigan was pulled up on an
indian pony standing beside lees horse

  what are they going to do with us
lieutenant she whispered where are
we going

  coat-of-blue called little bear from
his pony before the sun is down this
day your scalp will wave in the wind
before my lodge

  lee smiled faintly and leaned over to
whisper to irish lonnigan

  im going to duel little bear well
move back down the trail to fight in the
clearing now while i hold their attention
you slip away from the warriors and
ride for fort dodge dont stop dont
look back ride

  what about you lieutenant dupuy
never you mind about me just tell your
father everything thats happened here tell
him that the main body of cheyenne are
going to slip through the east cut tomor-
row morning while the dog soldiers at-
tack the regiment at broken arrow
canyon tell your father about pearl
white feathers and ask him to bring
charges against colonel hanks at fort
laramie when this campaign is over the
colonel is guilty of jeopardizing the sec-
urity of the regiment

  they were riding by twos down the
trail now little bear leading the party
chanting to himself the battle song of the
crazy dog society followed by his braves

and lee riding his big army mount be-
side irish lonnigan on an indian pony
when they reached the clearing little
bear rode on alone for several hundred
yards across the amphitheater and the
indians directed their two white prisoners
away to one side

  little bear had dismounted removed
his feather bonnet and was bathing him-
self in dust with prayers for victory to
the great spirit lee watched him curi-
ously a cheyenne brave rode up behind
the young officer and thrust at him his
sword and pistol belt without taking
his eyes from little bear now remount-
ing his pony on the other side of the
clearing lee buckled his weapons at his
waist

  if you had a spencer you could knock
him out of his saddle from here he has a
spencer but he wont use it unless he
has to hell want to hook you up on
that damned cheyenne lance

  lee turned to face irish lonnigan the
girl sat quietly on her pony near the
outer edge of the group of indians

  dont forget said lee aloud the
indians watched curiously it was hot
under the afternoon sun

  ah-ee-yahaaa screamed little bear
across the clearing

  lee drew his saber from his side and
unbuckled his pistol holster

  little bear stripped down to his breech
cloth came thundering across the clearing
crouched low on his pony screaming the
carbine bouncing on his back and the
spanish lance pointed before him in his
right hand he carried the lance and on
his left arm he wore a small painted
buffalo shield

  lee carried his saber straight in his
hands like a drill field soldier his horse
pranced around in a circle he wanted to
keep the fighting near the group of watch-
ing indians if possible to scatter them

  little bear came charging on toward
the officer and lee weaving his horse
from side to side rode to meet him the
cheyenne chief carried his lance on the
right side of the ponys neck when they
were but a few feet apart lee swung
his army horse sharply to the left and
little bear could not switch his lance over
his mounts head fast enough to catch the
charging cavalryman as he galloped past


indian stories

the indian covered his head with the
buffalo shield to protect himself from
lees saber blows

the cheyenne watching the fight
saw their chief riding top speed
into their midst and moved in all di-
rections out of his way lee as he turned
caught sight of irish lonnigan moving
her horse away from her captors

  squaw-man yelled lee they have
sung of the cheyenne that they are a
nation of warriors is this a warrior that
i fight nay a woman with heap
tongue

  ah-ee-yahaaa screamed little bear
in a rage he snatched a tomahawk from
one of the dog soldiers stuck it in his
belt and rode out into the clearing after
lee

  the young officer riding his pony
slowly looked back over his shoulder and
watched the indian charging after him
the tip of the cheyenne lance sparkled
and glistened in the sun

  lee appeared to run away from his
pursuer then turned and rode head on
at little bear slashing with his saber to
throw his opponent off balance the in-
dian slipped to one side of his pony and
hung around the neck of the animal lees
saber sliced through air above him

  the indian pony was quicker than
lees big army horse and wheeled sharply
behind the cavalryman little bear gal-
lojed after the officer tomahawk upraised
and threw the iron weapon at lees head
the young officer ducked and the hatchet
caught him in the shoulder and bounced
off lee rocked crazily in his saddle

  the indians were riding around the
edge of the clearing following the fight
and shouting to themselves in cheyenne
irish lonnigan had ridden still further
down the trail from the clearing she
would be out of sight around the bend in
another hundred yards

  little bear came about again to follow
up his attack but lee trying to gain
time galloped his big army mount into
the small indian pony and threw him off
balance lee hammered away with his
saber trying to gain an opening but the
indian half-breed took his lance in both
hands and blocked every blow the two
horsemen galloped across the clearing side

by side and the blows of the sword against
the metal lance sounded out

  hes good soldier stay on your guard
dont relax dont let him hook you on
the point of that thing

  at the edge of the clearing the dog
soldiers had caught the full excitemcnt
of the fight and rode up and down
eagerly shouting and irish lonnigan
walked her pony farther and farther
from them each succeeding encounter of
the two combatants put her nearer the
bend in the trail the duel continued for
several minutes neither man gaining an
advantage

  lee crashed his army horse into the
indian pony again seeking to knock him
down the pony went down on its hind
legs but little bear threw up his lance to
protect himself and brought it down with
a dull crack on lees saber arm the
cavalrymans sword went springing up-
ward with a metallic ring

  lee was only vaguely aware of little
bears cry of victory and the screaming of
the dog soldiers as he dug frantically
for his service revolver just as his hand
reached the butt of his colt the heavy
lance came around again catching him in
his side

  he didnt even sense the pain when
he opened his eyes again he was lying-in
the dust beside his horse and little bear
was maneuvering his pony toward him
still screaming

  he felt in the dust for his colt but
could not locate it little bear was leaning
far out of his saddle with his riding quirt
to count a coup on lee-touch a fallen
enemy with his whip-and lee quickly
grasped the end of the leather stock and
pulled the half-breed gieyenne tumbled
off his pony on top of the cavalry officer

  a cry of rage and surprise escaped
from the indian as lees fist caught him
in the throat the young officer snatched
a bone handle knife from little bears
breech cloth and raised it upward little
bear screamed as the knife fell the
cavalry officer brought the blade down
again and again until his hands were wet
and stick- and the cheyenne war chief
was still

  the dog soldiers momentarily stunned
by the unexpected turn of the combat now
raised a cry of revenge of their war chief
bride of the tomahawk pack



and came thundering across the clearing
lee lay between them and the trail leading
from the clearing his position was good
the enraged cheyenne would have to pass
him before they could take up the pur-
suit of their escaping girl prisoner whom
lee could see only faintly now in a cloud
of dust galloping hard down the rocky
path

  taking the feather-decorated carbine
from the body of the fallen little bear
lee cocked the piece kneeled and fired
between the legs of his horse the nearest
dog soldier low in his saddle and coming
fast jack-knifed from his pony when the
 cal slug hammered into him lee
fired again a second cheyenne grabbed
his stomach and hung in the air as his
pony galloped out from under him

  the rest of the cheyenne braves reined
up and began to fan out on the lone
cavalry officer a musket ball kicked up
the dust at his feet he lifted the spencer
again and calmly fired another dog
soldier went down

  lee picked up the crazy dog lance
from the ground and mounted his horse
a brave attempt to cut him off from the
trail fell under a swinging blow of the
big shaft and lee gained the rocky path
in a fast gallop

  if he could make the level country he
would beat them the little indian ponies
would be no match for the fast army
mount

viii

dawn came over the east passage
in a blaze of yellow revealing to
lees observant eyes the forms of blue-
clad soldiers huddled in the purple
shadows on either side of the canyon
crouched behind a huge boulder the
young cavalry officer pulled his saddle
blanket closer around him for protection
against the early morning cold his spen-
cer carbine rested on the rock in front of
him he waited patiently listening oc-
casionally watching the other men above
and below him

they had been there since midnight

  he remembered the words of colonel
hanks when he had ridden into fort
dodge the afternoon before

  i warn you lieutenant the colonel
had said that the charges you bring

against me are serious and should you
press them at fort laramie ill bring
counter-charges against you for slander
i will not tolerate having my career ruined
after nineteen years of service

  i tell you she was there sir in the
camp of american dog she told him
your exact plans and you are the only
person from whom she could have ob-
tained them pearl knew everything sir
she got to american dog even before i
did

  lee barefooted his blue uniform cut
to ribbons had sat on a wooden bench in
the orderly room of the rd cavalry
regiment the day before while the surgeon
had dressed his woundfc it had been late
in the afternoon and colonel hanks had
strode up and down over the plank floor
head forward his hands locked behind
him from time to time he had stopped
to scrutinize the military map on the wall

  it would be extremely unfortunate
lieutenant the colonel had continued to
have a record so brilliant as yours marred
by ugly court martial proceedings you
are young yet with years of service left
before you dont risk losing all that by
false accusations i know this indian girl
well pearl is loyal gentle and affection-
ate mister dupuy what you say about
her is impossible to believe i    here
the colonel had stumbled and groped for
words    even intend to marry her
mister after a respectable period of time
has elapsed after the death of my wife i
simply will not have her accused of
treachery

  miss lonnigan will bear out my
charges if you will question her sir lee
had insisted wearily

  i have told you mister that captain
lonnigans daughter is in a state of com-
plete collapse at the infirmary she was
found not far from dodge by the reg-
imental scouts just before you rode in
the colonel had been as rigid as a
statue in his firmness

  she will suport my changes when she
has sufficiently recovered lee had said

  perhaps lieutenant perhaps but in
the meanwhile i must determine whether
old american dog released miss lonnigan
of his own free will in accordance with
our plans and will lead his tribe into our
ambush at broken arrow canyon to-


indian stories

morrow morning or whether as you in-
sist she escaped with your help and the
cheyenne plan to slip out of the territory
by the east passage

  american dog will be out of the cut
by dawn tomorrow

  i would be inclined to believe your
story in every detail lieutenant but for
your preposterous accusations against
pearl white feathers what do you hope
to gain revenge do you hate all the
cheyenne indians for the unfortunate
death of your friend lt donahue yester-
day do you want to make a poor in-
nocent indian girl responsible for some-
thing she knows nothing about

  lee had thrown up his hands in a
gesture of hopeless dispair where is
pearl now colonel bring her in here to
question her yourself

  unfortunately mister hanks had
snapped pearl left before you did yes-
terday to visit the indian school at ft
laramie i expect her back tomorrow
and in the morning american dog
will lead his people through the east pas-
sage to colorado to join the southern
cheyenne on the war trail while the
crazy dogs engage the regiment at
broken arrow with a little holding at-
tack you cant believe that indian bitch
could torture a prisoner because she smiles
so sweetly on you

  watch your tongue lieutenant ill
have you thrown in the guardhouse sir
colonel hanks had shouted to him

  lee remembered pulling off his tunic
and turning his back angrily to the
colonel

  do you see that sir he had shouted
hotly thats what your affectionate
pearl white feathers did thats what
a sharpened cane reed in the hands of a
cheyenne squaw can do

  hanks face had drained white

  no doubt you were tortured lieu-
tenant by whom i dont know

  theres only one way i can convince
you sir you know that anyone who took
the lance away from the crazy dog
society would have to kill little bear
first

  and you contend that you did in a
duel witnessed by the dog soldiers them-
selves permitted miss lonnigan to es-
cape from under the very noses of the

cheyenne and got away yourself the
colonel had smiled a remarkable feat
mister truly remarkable

  angrily lee had brushed past the sur-
geon out of the orderly room and
walked to his horse in a minute he had
returned with the eight-foot shaft and
stuck it in the floor at the colonels feet

  the colonel had examined the crazy
dog lance curiously then turning to his
striker juarez he had said ride to
broken arrow canyon and instruct the
regiment to move immediately to the
east passage ill assume command there
at dawn

  lee had smiled in relief

  bugler bugler colonel hanks had
shouted from the doorway of the orderly
room sound boots and saddles turn
out the whole station force    cooks
bakers the regimental band even the
prisoner from the guard house i want
every trooper on this post under arms
full marching order and a hundred rounds
of ammunition in twenty minutes

  in a few minutes the whole garrison
had been responding with shouts to the
clear notes of the bugle

  putting on a new pair of boots lee
had hobbled painfully to the window the
garrison had been alive with activity an
old doctor waddled out of the infirmary
buckling a saber about his plump middle
as if he wasnt sure it was meant to be
there at the guard house a dozen or so
prisoners streamed out into the afternoon
sun blinking their eyes and wondering
at the confusion cooke had been one of
them a guard approached with an arm
load of spencer carbines and began issu-
ing them still wearing his apron white
with flour a cook from the mess hall had
emerged from the stables across the field
pulling behind him a stubborn army horse

  lee remembered the cold voice of the
colonel speaking

  if youre able to ride lieutenant you
may resume command of your platoon
the regiment may not be able to join us
at the east passage tomorrow before
american dog starts to move his people
through well need every man we can
get im even taking the prisoners from
the guardhouse i believe one of them
is from your platoon keep an eve on
him
bride of the tomahawk pack



  yes sir private cooke

  when we return ill prepare charges
against myself with you as the principal
complainant said hanks coldly not look-
ing up from his desk

  lee had paused uncertainly it had been
an unpleasant situation

  im sorry sir i dont know   

  no apologies necessary colonel
hanks had replied dully

  no apologies necessary thought lee
to himself again

  he remembered clearly the scene with
the colonel now the commanding officer
sat on a rock below him talking to a
major lee had watched him during the
night doing his duty as he saw it placing
his men waiting for dawn and for the
appearance of american dogs band

  which way will the indians come
lieutenant 

  lee turned around cooke was squatting
behind him his spencer carbine across
his knees

  lee pointed silently up the north end
of the canyon

  you yellow skunk if you had done your
job right donahue would be alive today
alive and waiting for his discharge i
hope you get yours today

  has the regiment been sighted yet
sir

  lee shook his head

  look lieutenant i know how you
feel about that lieutenant donahue that
got killed the other day i didnt mean it
to happen i couldnt help myself i was
afraid sir those crazy dogs were all
around me but i didnt meant the
troopers to get killed none of them it
doesnt do any good to say im sorry but
ill make it up to the regiment some-
how

  get back to your position trooper
said lee

  suddenly from the far end of the
canyon two shots from a spencer carbine
split the cool morning air the echo re-
verberated from the walls of the canyon

  there they are lieutenant called
sanchez to lee around the bend up
there the whole tribe

  the troopers farthest up the canyon
oepned fire with sharp scattered shots a
few indians dashed around the bend and
discharged their muskets

  hold your fire shouted colonel
hanks standing up in full view i want
to talk to american dog

  he was picking his way carefully down
the edge of the canyon behind him the
troopers waited tensely once on the floor
of the canyon the colonel paused cupped
his hands to his mouth and called up

  lt dupuy will you come with me
please american dog knows you and it
may be possible to reason with him

  lee stood up and began climbing down
sergeant sanchez watched him without
expression not exposing himself offering
with his eyes a kind of consoling sym-
pathy

  when he reached the colonel lee fell
in silently on his left side and began walk-
ing boldly up the canyon he could feel
the eyes of the troopers in the rocks bor-
ing down on him

  we may be able to bluff american-
dog said the colonel by way of
explanation the regiment should be
here in another half-hour if we can only
hold this pass

lee could make out the forms of
the indians flattened against the
rocks up the canyon from them a single
musket shot exploded from the indians
positions and smacked into the wall of
the canyon above the heads of the two
soldiers

  american dog shouted lee hold
your fire i have with me the chief of the
coats-of-blue he would hold a pow-wow
with you

  there was silence from the cheyenne
lines then from far down the canyon a
single horseman came riding slowly

  the colonel squinted into the morning
sun

  is that american dog he asked

  lee watched carefully the figure was
naked from the waist up and carried a
rifle across the saddle blanket

  too young for the chief said lee
wishing now he had brought his own
spencer must be one of the young
bucks

  the officers recognized the indian
horseman about the same time it was
pearl white feathers dressed in the
tribal regalia and painted for battle

  the colonel looked bewildered then


indian stories

 regained his composure

   ill handle this he said curtly stay
 here

   lee watched the old officer walking up
 the canyon to meet the girl he saw the
 colonel raise his hand and the girl stop
 they were too far away for lee to hear
 their conversation then easily unhur-
 riedly the indian girl swung her musket
 around on the old officer and very de-
 liberately pulled the trigger the shot rang
 out among the canyon rocks hanks
 turned toward his troopers with an ex-
 pression of disbelief as if betrayed then
 fell face-down on the floor of the canyon
 lee watched frozen in his tracks

   pearl turned her pony about and began
 walking him slowly back toward the
 indian positions raising himself on his
 elbow hanks pulled out his big service
 colt from his holster and fired at the girls
 back the explosion echoed up the wait-
 ing canyon and pearl hung onto the pony
 for a moment then toppled into the dust

   as the frightened pony galloped back
 down the canyon lee sprinted toward his
 commanding officer hanks raised himself
 again and shouted get back damnit
 thats an order the cheyenne will shoot
 you down if you come out here get back
 mister and hold that pass until the reg-
 iment can get here

   lee stopped the floor and walls of the
 canyon around him were alive with mus-
 ket balls ricocheting into the dust the
 cheyenne sharpshooters were trying to
 bring him down he turned and bolted
 for safety of the wall again just as an-
 other fusillade of shots broke from the
 indian position

   a few minutes later he was standing
 beside sergeant sanchez in the rocks
 where the troopers were entrenched they
 could see the colonel lying in full view
 of the indians up the canyon

   theyre mounting up for a charge
 sir said sanchez if we dont get
 colonel hanks out of there right away
 theyll run over him

   he ordered me back said lee he
 said to hold this pass until the regiment
  gets here

   as he turned lee caught sight of a
 blue-uniformed trooper his field kerchief
 a bright yellow around his neck sliding
 down the face of the canyon below them

  who is that fool demanded lee
does he want to get run down by
american dog 

  cooke replied sanchez blandly
where does he think hes going
they watched the lone cavalryman
picking his way from rock to rock moving
closer to colonel hanks at the opposite
end of the canyon american dog could
be seen directing his horsemen up on a
solid line preparing for a charge against
the little body of troopers several of the
braves spotted the lone blue-clad soldier
creeping along and their musket balls
spattered the stones about him covering
him in flint chips

  now a general war cry went up from
the cheyenne tribe and the indians began
their thundering charge cooke sprang
from the cover of the rocks and ran hard
toward the colonel while the ground
spurted around him under musket fire
the cheyenne band came riding on
screaming shooting and waving their
lances and the canyon was hidden in the
great cloud of dust raised by the feet of
their ponies cooke stumbled got up ran
on and reached the colonels side pick-
ing up the officer in his arms the cavalry-
man turned and started back toward the
safety of the rocks

  hold your fire shouted lee you
may hit our own people

  but the cheyenne horsemen drew closer
and lee saw that they were about to
trample the two struggling figures

  shoot high in volleys cried the young
officer desperately fire

  a ragged echo rattled from the walls of
the canyon and dug into the charging
indians but it was not strong enough
the wave of cheyenne rolled over the
two cavalrymen on the floor of the canyon
and cooke and the colonel disappeared
beneath the dust of the ponies feet

ix

tttpire shouted lee a second time

  a the spencers barked again and
cheyenne braves tumbled from their
horses around him other officers were
shouting and the cavalrymen firing and
the indians fired back up into the rocks
at the hidden blue-coats the canyon was
a din of exploding carbines muskets gun
bride of the tomahawk pack



 powder smoke screaming and dust am-
 erican dog could be seen walking his pony
 calmly among his braves pulling the
 wounded cheyenne back on their horses
 and pointing out the cavalrymen to his
 indian shrapshooters

   fire  screamed lee waving his
 sword fire were stopping them
 fire

   some of the braves had slipped past
 the soldiers and were riding for safety
 down the other end of the canyon the
 cheyenne attempted to keep their squaws
 and old people sheltered behind them
 there was a lot of screaming from the
 indians the troopers did their work
 grimly and silently shooting loading fir-
 ing into the struggling cheyenne mass

   at last the resistance broke and am-
 erican dog wheeled and led his people
 back down the canyon from where they
 had come leaving ground littered with his
 dead and wounded

   a young boy with a shattered leg picked
 himself up from among the bodies cover-
 ing the floor of the canyon and limped
 after the tribe the troopers let him go

   in the middle of the canyon a squaw
 sat wailing she had been shot through
 the neck

   an old warrior bleeding from chest
 wounds attempted to raise himself from
 the ground to continue his fight but his
 strength gave away and he fell down again
 silently to die

   mister dupuy yelled an officer on
 the other side of the canyon how many
 wounded have you 

   lees eyes searched the rocks around
 him his troopers watched him carefully

   none he shouted back in reply

  then will you send some of your
 troopers over on this side of the wall the
 firing is weak over here

   sergeant sanchez

   the platoon sergeant was already de-
 signating which men should go when lee
 called half a dozen blue-coats were
 scrambling down the rocky ledge and run-
 ning single-file across the floor of the
 canyon

   lee looked over the bodies below him
 beyond where the indians lay were two
 blue-uniformed bundles fairly kicked to
 pieces by the feet of the indian ponies
 they lay close together

  cooke and the colonel funny they
should end up like that old matt prob-
ably hated his guts and cookie died trying
to save him he wasnt yellow he looked
pretty good out there a while ago pretty
good he was something of a skunk but
he made up for it to the regiment he
ought to be recommended for a decoration

  lee heard a shuffling noise on the
rocks behind him and turned to face san-
chez

  you hear anything lieutenant
asked the platoon sergeant

  lee lestened no what

  sanchez cocked his head drums may-
be

  lee stiffened

  death drums theyre coming through
this time or die in the attempt

  the young officer listened intently for
several moments and at last detected the
faint pounding of a muffled drum and the
moans of the cheyenne preparing to make
their final charge

  lee stood up and shouted across the
canyon

  the cheyenne are coming through
this time theyre beating the death
drums get ready

  the noise was louder now as the tribe
moved closer marching in parade fashion
they were singing tribal songs and chant-
ing among themselves weaving as if they
were drugged the first indians appeared
around the bend in the canyon some of
the foot warriors were dancing the whole
spectacle was like a fantastic nightmare
that left the waiting troopers with a cold
feeling at the base of their skulls

  you havent seen anything like this
since powder river those cheyenne have
gone crazy theyll come through this
time you cant hold them back too bad
the regiment didnt get here

  lee gripped the stock of his carbine and
cocked back the hammer the cheyenne
were perfectly quiet now

  the sun was up high in the morning
and the purple shadows which had
covered the canyon earlier that morning
were now gone where the air had been
cool it was hot and damp and the at-
mosphere was weighted with the feeling
of impending action the only sounds
which arose from east canyon were the
groanings of the indians who had been

wounded in the first charge

  the death drums were silenced

  suddenly so suddenly that even the
watching cavalrymen were startled a
great cry went up from the indian band
and they began moving their horses for-
ward at a trot picking up speed as they
came a few troopers opened fire with
deadly persistent shots but the indians
came 

  now they approached the positions of
the cavalrymen and their voices lifted in
a cry of defiance which sounded down the
length of the canyon the shooting started
again in earnest-the even precise volleys
of the soldiers carbines against the scat-
tered replies of the indian muskets lee
loaded and fired cheyenne braves rolled
from their ponies in the blinding dust he
saw an indian brave ride up to a cavalry-
man pull him from behind a rock and
brain him with a war club lee fired at
the painted brave but lost him in the con-
fusion indians fell from their mounts
and were trampled by those thundering
behind them the cheyenne were going
through

  whats the use you cant stop them
a couple of thousand red sticks down
there against a hand full of troopers
youre lucky they dont take time out to
kill every calvalryman around here

  the mounted indians were past the
soldiers now followed by those on foot-
the squaws and the old the volleys of the
carbines took great chunks out of the in-
dian ranks which were quickly refilled by
other cheyenne pressing in from the
rear the slaughter was simply immense
when the women and children went past
screaming shooting like their men the
firing from the spencer carbines along
the walls of the canyon automatically died
out the great parade of screaming in-
dians continued past for several minutes
and toward the end as the cavalrymen
realized the futility of the killing there
was no shooting at all from their spencer
carbines

  let them come on you cant stop them
come on come on

  the screaming tribesmen were down the
canyon beyond the cavalrymens positions
it was quiet again the regiment had not
arrived and the cheyenne tribe was es-
caping to the south to join their brothers

path against the colorado
station force had failed to



on the war
settlers the
stop them

  lee stood up wearily stretched him-
self and looked down into the canyon
it was littered with the bodies of dead and
dying cheyenne

  sergeant sanchez everyone a 
right 

  the platoon sergeant came up cautiously
from below lees position and looked
around

  i saw one man get it sir i dont know
about the rest

  mister dupuy came a shout again
from across the canyon it was the same
voice the major better keep your men
under cover until the regiment does get
here those cheyenne might decide to
come back and clean out the rest of us

  lee waved his hand in acknowledge-
ment below him sanchez was moving
among the troopers checking on injuries
the sun had become unbearibly hot and
lee felt a vague resentment against the
regiment for not arriving in time he
suffered the nausea of the soldier defeated
in battle-the feeling of a child who has
misplaced a toy or a husband who dis-
covers an unfaithful wife he was sud-
denly sick of the whole unpleasantness

  it all happened again very quickly

  at the other end of the canyon the
indian muskets began firing anew the
major across the canylon began shouting
and the troopers were nervously loading
their carbines

  lt dupuy theyre coming back to
attack shouted sanchez from the floor
of the canyon he was scrambling back
up into the rocks

  like an ocean wave dashing itself to
bits on the rocks of a cliff the band of
american dog came swarming back down
the canyon the horsemen had overrun
those on foot and were leading the way
screaming and shouting the indians came
on lee saw one cheyenne warrior throw
down his musket and begin climbing up
the rock wall there was no firing only
the yelling

  above the confusion came the sound of
the rd cavalry regiments bugler blowing
charge

	indian stories

come in from the opposite end of the
canyon and bottled them up all the
indians want now is a way to escape

  hold your fire shouted lee here
comes the regiment

  the soldiers heard the bugle themselves
and were shouting their voices were
drowned out however by the noise of the
defeated cheyenne tribesmen streaming
back past them there was no shooting
the east canyon fairly thundered with
the noise of the savages and horses

  nov the regiment came into view
riding eight abreast sabers drawn and
flashing in the morning sunlight wave
after wave all the fight was gone now
from the indians they allowed themselves
to be driven before the wall of cavalrymen
like whipped dogs lee saw a trooper
ride up to a fat squaw who was attempting
to hide behind a rock spank her with
the flat of his blade and drive her back
into the retreating herd the power of
american dog was broken in the wyom-
ing territory once and for all times

  standing on a rock lee waved to
captain lonnigan as his troop galloped
past and the irishman reined up braggel
rode over to where the two officers stood

  we were afraid you wouldnt make
it laughed lee american dog came
within an inch of escaping out of the
territory

  the regiment was held up by the
crazy dogs replied lonnigan

  lee you should have been there
said braggel eagerly the dog soldiers
rode right into our gatling gun we
knocked them over like nine-pins man
they high-tailed back toward the reser-
vation the boy was excited at last he
had seen battle

  i received word that you brought back
irish said lonnigan i want to thank
you

  we heard you killed little bear too
he sneaky half-breed is that right he
wasnt with his crazy dogs id like to get
a crack at him this was young braggel
again

  yes hes dead replied lee since
yesterday the colonel was killed this
morning cooke attempted to rescue him
and they were both trampled by the

horses

 cooke questioned lonnigan

wasnt that the trooper in your platoon
the colonel was going to court martial foi
cowardice 

  lee nodded slowly

  the regiment was engaged in round-
ing up all the cheyenne stragglers now
troopers rode up and down the canyon
bringing in prisoners it had been a com-
plete victory for the rd cavalry a dust
cloud in the distance marked the progress
of the cheyenne band returning to their
reservation

  hey lieutenant called sanchez
theyre bringing in old american dog
as a prisoner hes hurt and he wants to
see you

  lee looked up curiously and saw a
body of horsemen approaching slowly
down the canyon american dog sup-
ported on each side by one of his young
braves was riding in a platoon of cav-
alry surrounded him

  he  he looks awfully old doesnt
he said braggel uncertainly as if it had
just occurred to him that war is not the
glamorous business he had thought

  lee walked across the canyon to meet
the prisoners american dog lifted his
hand feebly he had been shot in the
stomach and clamped a stick in his mouth
to keep his teeth from chattering the
braves helped to hold him and removed
the stick so he could speak behind him
the cavalry troopers waited uneasily with
expressions of guilt written on their
faces

  the crazy dogs chant that the coat-
of-blue has slain little bear the war chief
of the cheyenne his women weep in
his lodge but they kiss the hand of the
coat-of-blue for keeping the honor of
their chief the coat-of-blue has let the
fallen little bear keep his scalp for the
life in the happy hunting grounds

  lee cleared his throat nervously and
the pain of the old mans wound caused
him to stop talking for a moment

  the crazy dogs chant that the coat-
of-blue has taken in battle the great
lance which has been among the chey-
enne for many seasons and kept them a
strong and great nation now the great
lance is gone from the crazy dog
society and the cheyenne are beaten we
go now back to the lands which the coats-
of-blue have given to us
bride of the

tomahawk pack



  hear one my brothers from this day
forward in the lands of my people i no
more make war on the white man

  with that american dog extended his
musket to lee butt first then turned with
his captors to begin the ride back to the
reservation

  lee watched them riding slowly back
down the canyon

  i guess that ends the indian wars
observed braggel

  the wyoming territory will be quiet
as a church yard now said sanchez he
had been standing quietly behind lee
during the whole interview

  captain lonnigan rubbed his chin
thoughtfully and open for settlers he
added

  real civilized smiled braggel happily
a man wouldnt be afraid to live out
here with his bride

  lee didnt reply he was thinking of
how the crazy dog lance would look
mounted on the wall in his quarters

  give you five gold dollars for it lieu-
tenant grinned sanchez reading his
thoughts

  lee smiled not for sale sergeant
not for a million

  itll be too quiet around here with the
crazy dogs tamed down said sanchez
makes a fighting man think about trans-
ferring to the infantry down in texas
theyre fighting comanches down there
lee laugh ted out loud come off of it
sergeant you know you wouldnt leave
the rd cavalry you love your horses
too much

  the platoon sergeant slung his carbine
over his shoulder and rubbed his seat
tenderly

  i may be a cavalryman at heart tv
grinned but ive got the behind of a
nursemaid sir
