our august first number

tn the unknown revolution denby brixton has taken for his subject
that tremendous problem which lives eternally upon our western borders--japan and
mexico will they realize their dream of conquest and expansion japan to gain new
territory for her ever-growing millions mexico to win back the traditional possession of
what was once hers the vast rich california that secret intrigues are constantly de-
veloping between the two nations with this end in view is beyond the shadow of a doubt
denby brixton shows the agents of japan and mexico actually bringing about what to
most of us seems inconceivable-the wresting from us of part of our country and the
planting there as a dominating power those two alien races but then uncle sam slowly
but surely takes a hand in the persons of three of his ablest representatives of the secret
service pitted against them are the master mind of japans statesmen and the powerful
allied factions of mexico what ensues forms one of the most thrilling narratives that it

chapter i

from some point far overhead a
musical humming became audiwe
it was not the rasping roar of an
aeroplane motor but a deep truly melo-
dious note that seemed to grow rapidly
in volume the soft-voiced conversa-
tions on the upper deck were hushed
every one listened to the strange sound
from above it grew and became clear
and distinct the source seemed to
come nearer at last the sound came
from a spot directly overhead then
passed over and toward the narrows

  a cold breeze beat down suddenly
it was not a cool sea breeze but a cur-
rent of air coming down from directly
above the coney island steamer it
was actively actually cold a chorus
of exclamations arose full of the wit
of the american a-holidaying
br-r-r-r i feel a draft

  say min are you givin me the cold
shoulder

  sadie dyott want to borrow all of
my coat or only the sleeve

  and one young man caused a ripple
of laughter by remarking


a thousand degrees below zero

  feels like my mother-in-law was
around somewhere

  people hastened to put on such wraps
as they had with them on the lower
decks there arose a sound of tired
voices saying with variations only in
the names called

  johnnie button up your coat its
getting cold

  the cold wave lasted only for a few
moments however as the steamer
forged ahead the strata of cold air
seemed to be left behind and the hum-
ming sound grew fainter if the pas-
sengers on the boat had listened they
might have heard a faint splash in the
water behind them but as it was the
sound went unnoticed the humming
died away the boat went on and
docked and the passengers dispersed
to their homes every one of them
woke the next morning to find himself
or herself locally celebrated

  half an hour after the coney island
boat had docked a tramp steamer was
nosing her way out of the narrows
she was traveling at half speed the air
was clear the channel was well buoyed
and there seemed no possibility of any
harm or danger befalling her the
lookout leaned over the bow negligently
watching and listening to the indignant
interchange of whistle signals between
two small tugs in a dispute over the
right of way he dropped his eyes and
stiffened then turned toward the pilot
house and shouted frantically but too
late the shout had hardly left his lips
before there was a shock and grinding
sound mingled with the raucous shriek
of rent and tormented iron plates the
tramp steamer shuddered and stopped
and began to sink a trifle by the head
at the first intimation of danger the
man on the bridge had ordered the
water-tight doors closed and now he
rang for full speed astern the tramp
swung free of the unknown obstruc-
tion but the two bow compartments
were flooded and the steamers stem

was lifted until the propeller thrashed
helplessly in a useless mixture of air
and water her whistle bellowed an
appeal for help want immediate as-
sitancc

  half a dozen tugs including the two
that had been quarreling by whistle
responded to the stricken steamers call
their small sirens sent cheery messages
promising instant aid and they began
to tear across the water toward her
one tug reached the helpless vessels
side a second rushed up and began
to pull the unwieldy tramp away from
the unknown obstacle the lights of
a third could be seen very near when
there was a crash and a frantic bellow
from the tug it also had struck the
obstruction against which the tramp
had run the tramp bellowed anew

  a destroyer shot down the river with
a searchlight unshipped her crew
standing by to rescue any persons who
could be reached by lifeboats she
swung up and saw the tramp being
hauled and pulled at by busy puffing
tugs the long pencil of light danced
over the surface of the water to find
the-derelict or wreck that had caused
the trouble back and forth it swept
and then stopped with a jerk as if the
operator could not believe his eyes

  floating soggily in the water of new
york harbor in late august-the hot-
test time of the year-a wide cake of
ice lay glistening under the searchlight
rays the harbor waves ran up to the
edge of the ice cake and stopped be-
yond their stopping point the surface
was still and glassy the cake floated
heavily in the water and shpwed no
sign of cracks or fissures it was evi-
dently of considerable thickness

  a second searchlight reenforced the
first the two white beams moved
back and forth incredulously examin-
ing the expanse of ice it was hundreds
of yards across at last one of the
beams passed something at the center
of the cake and hastily returned to the
a thousand degrees below zero



thing it had seen rising calmly and
quietly from what seemed to be a small
crater at the center of the ice cake a
plume of steam floated placidly into the
air it was a huge plume precisely
like the flowing of a white ostrich
feather rising from a small orifice in
the center of the mass of frozen sea
water

  a wail from the siren of the tug that
had run against the ice cake caused the
searchlights to turn in its direction
the engine had ceased to run and a
cloud of escaping steam was pouring
from the tugs funnel men on the
deck gesticulated frantically the de-
stroyer ran as close as the commander
dared and he shouted through a mega-
phone it was impossible to distinguish
words in the confused shouts that came
back from half a dozen throats at once
but the searchlights soon showed the
cause of the excitement the men on
the tug pointed over the side the
small harbor waves rolled uncon-
cernedly up to a point some twenty
feet from the stern of the tug but there
they stopped abruptly the tug had
become inclosed in the ice floe as
those on the destroyer watched the
twenty feet became thirty and the thirty
forty the ice cake was increasing in
size with amazing rapidity

  a boat put off from the destroyer
and the commander shouted to the
crew of the tug to take to the ice
there was a moments hesitation and
then they jumped over the side and
ran to the edge of the floe the life-
boat touched the edge and was instantly
frozen fast but the sailors managed to
break it free again by herculean efforts
it went back to the destroyer whose
wireless almost instantly began to
crackle two other destroyers dashed
down from the brooklyn navy yard
and turned their searchlights on the
strange visitor in the harbor the sem-
aphore of the first destroyer on the
scene began to flash and the three lean

naval craft began to circle around the
huge ice cake warning away all other
craft and constantly measuring and re-
measuring the size of the mass of ice
one of the destroyers at last slipped
outside the narrows and stayed there
patrolling back and forth to keep other
vessels from running foul of the
strange and as yet inexplicable phe-
nomenon

  by daybreak the battery was a black
mass of people they looked eagerly
toward the narrows but could see
nothing but a wall of mist from which
the gray shape of a destroyer now and
then emerged high in the air how-
ever the plume of steam was visible
it wras now more than a thousand feet
high and was dense and white the
first rays of the sun had gilded the
top while the ground below was still
dim and dark but now it rose in calm
and quietness to an unprecedented
height mystifying the people who
looked at it and causing a sudden si-
lence to fall upon them all a warm
moist sea breeze had blown in from
the ocean during the night and had been
changed to fog as it passed over the
expanse of ice so that the ice itself
was hidden from view but the tall
plume of steam told of some mysteri-
ous menace to humanity that the crowd
assembled at the battery feared with-
out understanding

  as the mass of people watched the
supremely calm column of steam rising
high in the air of that august morning
newsboys began to circulate among
them their strident cries sounding
strangely among the silent multitude
the narrows were frozen solidly from
shore to shore and all entrance to and
egress from new york harbor was
blocked small craft could go out be-
hind staten island through the kill
van kull and some vessels could use
the other channel which goes from the
east river into the sound but the great
ambrose channel-one-third the size


a thousand degrees below zero

of the panama canal-and the broad
opening that made new york the great-
est port on the atlantic coast was
closed the growth of the ice cake
had greatly lessened so that it could
be predicted that it would not expand
far beyond its present size but its ori-
gin and the means by which it resisted
the disintegrating effect of the august
warmth were utterly unknown the
cause of the plume of steam from the
center of the ice cake was an unfath-
omable mystery

  suddenly from the empty sky there
came a deep musical humming in-
stinctively people looked up the hum-
ming grew louder and more distinct
while curious eyes swept the sky

  then a black speck appeared below
one of the fleecy white clouds and
dropped toward the earth a thousand
feet two thousand feet it fell then
checked and hung steadily in the air
those who looked with the naked eye
could only discern that it seemed like
a wingless black splinter suspended
above the earth but those who had
glasses saw the whir of dark disks
above a black stream-line body a
small cabin was placed amidships and
a misshapen globe hung from chains
below it was still for several min-
utes the passenger or passengers
seemed to be inspecting the earth be-
low and particularly the ice cake with
deliberation and care then it began
to rise with the same deliberation and
certainty swung around and sped off
with incredible speed toward the north-
east the humming sound grew fainter
and died away but the crowd standing
on the battery began to murmur with
a nameless sense of fear

chapter ii

mew york was frightened and
the newspapers as they appeared
did not allay that fear the conserv-
ative tribunal ran a scare head

has the glacial age come again

and printed underneath a resume of the
phenomena up to the time of going to
press-which did not include the ap-
pearance of the black flyer-with an
interview from a prominent scientist
an enterprising reporter had routed
the worthy gentleman out of bed and
rushed him to the scene of the expand-
ing ice cake in a fast motor boat taking
down in shorthand his comments on
the matter the scientist had been
much puzzled but spoke at length nev-
ertheless he said in part

  has the glacial age come again i do
not know i can only say that we have no
certain knowledge of the original cause of
the glacial period and we cannot say
definitely that it did not begin in precisely
this fashion we have volcanos which radi-
ate incredible quantities of heat to the coun-
try surrounding them no phenomenon like
this has occurred before but it may be that
some unknown cause may bring to the sur-
face a condition the antithesis of a volcano
which instead of radiating heat will bring
on local glacierlike conditions one might go
farther and suggest that the earth may alter-
nate between periods of volcanic activity
during which it is warm and conditions are
favorable for habitation and growth and
periods of this new antivolcanic activity dur-
ing which frigidity is normal and mankind
may be forced to take refuge in the tropic
zones still i cannot say definitely

  the eminent scientist went on for
two full columns during which he re-
fused to say anything definite but sug-
gested so many alarming possibilities
that every one who read the tribunal
was thrown into a state of mind not
far from panic he offered no expla-
nation of the plume of steam

  when the appearance of the black
flyer became known in the newspaper
offices city editors threw up their
hands the less conservative printed
the wildest explanations they put
forth a virulent-organism theory
which it must be admitted was no
farther from the truth than most of
the others the story began with an
a thousand degrees below zero



interview with the boatswain in charge
of the boat crew from the destroyer

  we were ordered to take the men off the
ice and to take especial care not to be nipped
ourselves we rowed carefully toward the
edge of the ice cake with the light of the
searchlights to guide us we would see
where the floe began when the waves
dropped back from it fve been in northern
seas but i never saw anything like that the
edge of the ice wasnt smooth and worn away
by the waves it was rough with frost
crystals that reached out like fingers grab-
bing at the things near by when we came
close to the edge some of the men in my
boat were scared and i dont blame them
id dipped my hand overboard and the water
was warm-and twenty feet away there was
that mass of ice we backed up to the ice
cake and took off the men i was looking
over the side of the life boat and saw those
long crystals forming and growing while i
watched they were huge from two feet
long for the largest to three or four inches
for the smallest they reached out and
reached out terribly the stern of the boat
was touching the ice and i saw them reach-
ing for the hull like the tentacles of an octo-
pus they fastened on and began to grow
thicker we took oars and smashed them
feeling frightened as one is frightened in a
nightmare as fast as we broke them they
formed again and the men on the ice seemed
to be rotten slow getting into the boat though
i dont doubt but they were hurrying all they
knew how when they were all aboard we
had to work like mad to get clear

  the paper went on to expound its
own idea of what had happened

  the sinister growth of the ice crystals
is significant there has always been no-
tice of and comment upon the striking sim-
ilarity between the growth of crystals and
the growth of plants until now all sci-
entific text-books have said that crystals
could only grow in a supersaturate solution
of their own substance and claimed that they
were not organic growths-in the sense of
growths caused by an intelligence within the
crystal is it not possible that the scientists
have been wrong is it not possible that crys-
tals are growths in the same way that plants
are growths granting that what is to
keep a scientist from isolating and cultivating
the crystal embryo we have done that with
germs and with the life germs in eggs and
plants we can even use a proccss of
pathenogenesis and create monsters from the
unfertilized eggs of frogs and sea urchins

why could not this scientist experiment until
the life germ of the ice crystal could be de-
veloped and enlarged why could not this
development continue until the germ could
not only create its crystals under the most
favorable conditions of temperature but at
the normal temperature of watert at the
harvard laboratories water has been kept
liquid far below its normal freezing point
and under tremendous pressure has been
found to remain ice at a temperature of one
hundred degrees fahrenheit can we doubt
that this appearance of ice at this extraor-
dinary season is due to the malicious activ-
ities of a foreign government envious of our
magnificent merchant marine and com-
merce

  the explanation was ingenious but
though the scientific facts quoted were
quite correct the inference was hardly
justifiable water can and does reach
a temperature several degrees below
 fahrenheit without solidifying-as
may be proved by putting a glass of
water in a cold room in winter-hut
the slightest jar causes the instanta-
neous formation of ice crystals and in
a little while the whole mass is solid
the fact of hot ice must also be ad-
mitted but it requires a pressure of
rather more than fifty tons to the
square inch and is rarely attempted

  this paper also was forced to admit
as inexplicable the plume of steam
which rose from a thousand to fifteen
hundred feet into the air in any event
the claim that a certain unfriendly for-
eign government was trying to ruin the
commerce of the united states was
effectively squashed by cablegrams
from gibraltar folkestone and yoko-
hama three great icebergs had formed
in the straits of gibraltar and extended
until they joined when a solid mass
of ice made a bridge that once more re-
joined the continents of africa and
europe from ceuta to the rock the
plumes of steam were visible here too
three mighty columns of white mist
rose at equal distances across the gap

  folkestone harbor was a mass of ice
a great transatlantic liner had been


a thousand degrees below zero

caught in the expanding berg and the
huge hull had been crushed like so
much cardboard the passengers and
crew had escaped across the ice the
great steam plume made a wonderful
sight for miles around yokohama was
similarly visited three battleships of
the japanese fleet were frozen in and
their hulls cracked and broken the
plume of steam-nearly two thousand
feet high-had aroused the latent su-
perstition of the japanese and was

  	mg exorcised in every shinto temple
iti the kingdom

 the panic which was engendered by
the mysteries of the icebergs and the
unknown motives of the men so ob-
 usly responsible for their appearance
grew in intensity new york was in
a blue funk the police felt the tremor
that means that at any moment the
crowds thronging the streets might
break and from sheer panic become un-
controllable every patrolman wore a
worried frown and worked like mad
to keep the crowds moving moving
always the strain was becoming
greater however and troops were be-
ing hastily moved into the city when
an announcement was made by the
british foreign office

  it has been decided to make public a com-
munication received at the foreign office bear-
ing on the blocking of folkestone harlor the
straits of gibraltar yokahama and new
york the communication is dated from
uthe dictatorial residence and reads as
follows

  to the premier of great britain  you
are informed that the blocking of folkestone
harbor as well as that of the straits of
gibraltar new york and yokahama is evi-
dence of my intention and power to assume
control of the governments of the world as
dlcutor present administrations and sys-
 of government will continue in power
under my direction and subject to my com-
mands the machinery of the league of na-
tions is to be used to enforce my decrees
you will readily understand that the same
means i used to block the harbors and
straits now frozen over can be extended in-
definitely rivers can be made to cease to
flow lakes to irrigate and all commerce and

agriculture forced to suspend its activity
this will be done if it is made necessary by
the refusal of the governments of the world
to accede to my demands given under my
hand at the dictatorial residence

  signed	wladislaw varrhus

  the foreign office offers this communica-
tion to allay the fears of the public that a
new glacial period may be imminent but at
the same time it wishes to assure the british
people that the demands of the writer are
not taken seriously it is evident that the
maker of such absurd demands is insane
and though he may be able to cause perhaps
serious inconvenience to commerce a means
of nullifying his invention will be forthcom-
ing in a short while british scientists are
studying the folkestone phenomena and are
confident of a prompt solution of the prob-
lem

  though it might have been expected
that such an announcement as that of
the intention of an unknown and prob-
ably insane man to make himself ruler
of the world would have caused even
greater panic the reverse was actually
the case the motive behind the crea-
tion of the icebergs was made so clear
that the world settled back with a sort
of sporting interest to see what would
happen it had not long to wait

  a hint came by some underground
channel that professor hawkins had
offered a suggestion to the american
government that had been accepted as
a basis for experiment a reporter
went post-haste to the professors home
he was admitted but the professor
would not see him at the moment the
reporter sat down patiently to wait a
motor car drove up to the house and
a man in soldiers uniform stepped out
the reporter gave a whistle a sec-
ond car discharged a quietly dressed
man in civilian clothes attended by two
other army officers the reporter
stared he recognized the men most
people on two continents  would have
recognized them they passed through
the house to the professors laboratoxy
at the rear a long time passed the
reporter fidgeted nervously some con-
a thousand degrees below zero



ference of colossal importance was tak-
ing place back there in the laboratory

  it was an hour later that the visitors
left with them went a young man
the reporter had not seen before the
professor came slowly into the room
and smiled apologetically

  i am very sorry to have kept you
waiting but it was necessary i think
that in about two hours i will have
some news for you in the meantime
there is nothing more to say

  can you tell me what really hap-
pened how did this varrhus make
the berg

  its the simplest thing in the world
said the professor with a smile ive
managed to duplicate it on a small scale
back in my laboratory suppose you
come back there and ill show you

  a girl appeared in the doorway with
a worried frown on her face

  father has teddy gone

  yes well hear in about two
hours the professor turned to the
reporter with instinctive courtesy
this is my daughter evelyn

  the girl shook hands

  you want to know about the ice-
berg too teddy has gone to break
it up now

  to try to break it up corrected
the professor with a smile  teddy
is my assistant

  but how insisted the reporter
you seem to be so confident and every
one else does nothing but guess

  ill show you quite clearly the pro-
fessor said gently if youll come back
to the laboratory

  they moved toward the rear of the
house a hullabaloo of whistles broke
out in the harbor the girl turned to-
ward the professor

  teddy already

  the professor frowned

  he hasnt had time he went to
a window and looked out inspecting
the sky keenly a slender black splin-
ter hung suspended in the air the

professor flung open the window and
a musical humming filled the room as
they watched a smoking object detached
itself from the black flyer and fell
downward

  that must be varrhus said the
professor

  a winged flyer with the insignia of
the american aviation corps painted on
the under surface of its wings darted
into their field of vision black smoke
trailed behind it as it shot toward the
sinister black craft there was an in-
stants pause and then little puffs of
white mist appeared before the pro-
peller of the aeroplane

  hes firing his machine gun said
the reporter excitedly

  as he spoke the black flyer dropped
like a stone and the american plane
shot above it almost instantly the
black flyer checked in mid-air and rose
vertically with amazing speed the
american plane drove on for a second
and then wavered it began to climb
stalled and dropped toward the earth
in a series of side slips and maple-leaf
turns it came down erratically cra-
zily

  killed said the professor with -
compressed lips

  his daughter uttered a cry

  and varrhus is getting away

  the black flyer had become but the
merest speck it had attained an al-
most unbelievable height now it de-
liberately swung around and headed off
toward the northeast with its same in-
credible speed

chapter iii

teddy gerrod was stuffing his
feet into heavy fur-lined arctic
boots ten or twelve soldiers were
loading clumsy awkward-looking en-
gines on improvised sledges resting on
the ice at the foot of the fort embank-
ments others were putting equally
ungainly iron globes with winged metal
io

a thousand degrees below zero

rods attached to them on other sledges
a dozen befurred and swathed figures
came down the slope of the embank-
ment and examined the preparations
a naval launch ran smartly alongside
the edge of the ice and a messenger
came over at the double to the com-
mandant of the fort who stood by
teddy gerrod the messenger saluted

  sir the object dropped from the
black flyer was a tin float having a
message attached the smoke was
from a smoke fuse lighted to attract
attention

  he handed over the letter saluted
again and retired the commandant
tore open the letter and read it through
then swore frankly

  a threat to freeze the croton reser-
voir and cut off new york citys water
supply if an answer to his previous de-
mands is not given within forty-eight
hours and he can do it mr ger-
rod youve simply got to settle this
business new york would go crazy
if the people knew this theced be
no way to supply the water the city
has to have and seven million people

without water-

  teddy smiled grimly

  im going to try professor haw-
kins is usually right and we ought to
be able to do something about this
berg 

  a second messenger came up and
saluted

  sir lieutenant davis reports that
the plane has been recovered and lieu-
tenant curtiss body examined there
are no bullet marks and the body
seemed to be frozen solidly -he can-
not say as yet what caused lieutenant
curtiss death

  frozen said teddy laconically

  in mid-air asked the commandant
sharply and in a fraction of a sec-
ond wearing heavy aviators clothing
teddy nodded and buttoned up the
huge fur coat in which he was envel-
oped

  pm ready to start off now if the
sledges are

  the little party moved away from
the shore the heavy mist still hung
over the expanse of ice but near the
shore the ice was thinner the sledges
were roped together and teddy walked
at the head the party tugged at the
ropes on the sledges puffing out clouds
of frosty breath at every exhalation
teddy had taken the compass bearings
of the steam plume and after he had
gone a hundred yards from the shore
the wisdom of his course became ap-
parent they were completely sur-
rounded by a thick fog in which ob-
jects five yards off were lost to view
teddy leading the small column could
not be seen except as a dim and shad-
owy figure by the men hardly more than
two paces in his rear he referred
constantly to his compass and once or
twice glanced at the thermometer he
had strapped on the sleeve of his great
coat

  forty degrees he murmured to
himself and in new york its
eighty-four in the shade the ice must
be colder still because its dry and
hard

  the party toiled on presently small
snow crystals crunched underfoot

  frozen mist said teddy and
glanced at his thermometer hm
twenty-two degrees ten below freez-
ing

  the party stopped for a breathing
spell

  i hope you men smoke said teddy
because its going to be cold a few
hundred yards farther on well come
clear of this mist presently if you
smoke and inhale itll probably warm
up your lungs a little you dont need
it yet though any of you who havent
pulled down the flaps of your helmets
had better do so now

  a moment or so later they took up
their march again the sledges with
their heavy loads were cumbersome
a thousand degrees below zero

t

things to drag over the uneven surface
of the ice the men panted and gasped
as they threw their weight on the ropes
teddy felt the air growing colder still
and presently noticed that the mist no
longer seemed to be as thick as before
he glanced down at the front of his
heavy fur coat it was covered with
tiny white crystals he held up his
hand with the thick mitten on it to
form a dark background and saw num-
berless infinitesimal snowflakes drifting
slowly toward the ice under his feet
his thermometer showed two degrees
above zero-and new york six miles
away was sweltering in august heat

  not much farther he called cheer-
fully were almost there

  they panted and tugged on a hun-
dred and fifty yards more then they
stopped and stared

  three hundred yards away the great
column of steam was issuing from the
ice a hollow hillock of snow and ice
rose to a height of twenty feet like the
miniature crater of a volcano from
it in an unbroken stream the mass
of steam emerged with a roaring rush-
ing sound it rose five hundred feet
before it broke into the plumelike for-
mation that was so characteristic
there was a space perhaps six hundred
paces across in which there was no
mist the cold was too intense to allow
of the formation of fog water vapor
condensed instantly in that frigid at-
mosphere rut around the clearing the
mist rose from the surface of the ice
it became noticeable when it was
merely waist-high then rose to the
height of a man and climbed to a height
of fifty feet in a circular wall all about
the strange white open space teddy
looking at the top of the wall of vapor
saw that it undulated gently as if waves
were flowing back and forth around the
tall column of steam

  the men began to unload their
sledges the awkward little trench
mortars were set in place and careful

measurements made of the distance to
the steam plume while the men la-
bored teddy moved forward toward
the central cone five degrees below
zero fifteen degrees below zero thirty

degrees below zero- his breath cu

sharply when it went into his lungs
teddy put his rmttened hand over his
nose and face to partially warm the
air before he breathed it in now even
through the heavy arctic clothing he
wore he felt the bitter cold he de-
tached the thermometer from his sleeve
and clumsily tied it to a cord he had
hoped to be able to lower it dowm the
rim of the crater but that was impos-
sible he flung it toward the hillock
of snow and ice let it remain there an
instant then hastily drew it back to read
it the ether in the thermometer had
frozen into a solid mass in the bulb
of the instrument

  teddy went back to where the men
had made ready four of the wicked
little guns would fling their three-hun-
dred-pound bombs into the center of
the column of steam if all went well
at least one charge of t n t would
explode far down the orifice

  the propelling charges had been in
serted and now the slender rods were
put into the muzzles of the short squat
weapons the winged bombs were
balanced on the muzzles like top-heavy
oranges on as many sticks at half-
second intervals the four guns went
off one after the other

  before the last had exploded or just
as the flame leaped from its muzzle
the hillock of ice rose as in an eruption
four cracking detonations blended into
one colossal roar that half stunned the
little fur-clad party the rush of air
threw them from their feet when
they rose again a huge hole showed in
the center of the clearing a gaping
chasm that wtent down deep into the
heart of the ice a cloud of yellowish
smoke floated above them and the
column of steam had ceased only a


a thousand degrees below zero

few stray wisps of white vapor floated
up from the opening

  its doner

  teddy gave orders for a quick return
to the fort the mortars could be re-
turned for at the moment the impor-
tant thing was to send the news to eng-
land and japan

  the return trip was made quickly
and teddy made hurried explanations
to the commandant of the forts of what
should be done men should bore deep
holes twenty feet apart the holes to be
along the edges of clearly defined sec-
tions of the ice simultaneous blasts
should be set off and the sections would
iloat free the iceberg would not grow
again it was done for

 cablegrams were prepared and
rushed through to folkestone yoko-
hama and gibraltar if men took
trench mortars and fired shells that
would fall down the holes from which
the steam issued the cause of the ice
cakes would be destroyed and the ice
itself could be blasted off and towed out
to sea to melt

  teddy rushed back to the professors
home to report to him the full verifica-
tion of his theories and it was there
and then that the first authentic expla-
nation of the ice floe was given to the
world word of his effort and of the
disappearance of the steam plume had
preceded him and as he sped uptown in
the taxicab newsboys were already on
the streets with their extras only the
front pages-showing signs of having
hastily been hacked to pieces to make
room for the story-had anything about
the latest development and those extras
are singularly perfect reflections of the
public attitude at that time

chapter iv

peddy threw himself out of the
machine and rushed up the steps
evelyn opened the door before he could
ring and his beaming face told her

the news he had to give even without
his enthusiastic it worked

 the steam plume has stopped
asked the professor anxiously

  absolutely said teddy cheerfully
not a sign of steam except from two
or three puddles of hot water that were
cooling off when we left to get back
to the fort the commandant was set-
ting his men to work with the navy-
yard men when i started here

  tell me about this wont you said
the reporter briskly ill catch the
devil from the city editor for missing
out on that part of it but if youll give

me the full story-

  whats your paper 

  the reporter told him

  thats all right said teddy easily
they were calling extras of that paper
as i came uptown the professor has
told you the theory of the thing
no said evelyn he was starting
to but the black flyer appeared and shot
down the other aeroplane and father
was so much upset that he couldnt go
into details was the pilot of the aero-
plane killed

  teddv nodded

  frozen poor chap he never knew
what struck him

  what did happen asked the re-
porter again you people seem to take
this so much as a matter of course
and no one else can do anything but
guess

  the professor knows more about
low temperatures than any other man
in the world explained teddy its
only natural that he should be fairly
certain of his facts

  he smiled at the professor as the
old man made a deprecating gesture

  father is much upset said evelyn
i think it would he best if teddy ex-
plained will that be all right

  only in your account of the mat-
ter said teddy decidedly the pro-
fessor must be given credit for the
a thousand degrees below zero



whole thing its his work and hes
entitled to it

  no no protested the professor
teddy did a great deal

  evelyn pressed his arm and he obe-
diently was quiet the two young peo-
ple smiled at him

  you see how i am ruled said the
professor in mock tragedy my daugh-
ter-

  is going to see that you rest a
while said evelyn with a twinkle in
her eyes teddy you go and explain
the whole thing while i take father out
and discipline him

  with a laugh she led the old man
away teddy smiled

  we arent accustomed to reporters
he said or i suspect wed act differ-
ently miss hawkins is a most capable
physicist and helps her father im-
mensely the three of us work to-
gether so much that- well come

along to the laboratory

  the two went to the rear of the
house on the way they passed through
a long room full of glass cabinets in
which odd bits of metal work glittered
brightly

  the professors hobby said teddy
with a nod toward the cases antique
jewelry and ancient metal work hes
probably better informed on low tem-
peratures than any one else i know
of but i really believe hes as much
of an authority on that too this is
phoenician and thats early greek
these arc egyptian in this case this
way

  he opened a small door and they
were in the laboratory

  im afraid ill have to lecture a
bit said teddy heres how the
professor used to work out what was
taking place out in the harbor

  he showed an intricate combination
of silvered globes tubes and half a
dozen thermometers

  you see teddy began the water
in the harbor was at a certain tempera-

ture at this time of the year it would
be around  fahrenheit the pro-
fessor knew that fact and then the fact
that a huge mass of it was turned into
ice when you turn water into ice
you have to take a lot of heat out of
it and that heat has to go somewhere
when water freezes normally in winter
that heat goes into the air which is
cold in this case the air was con-
siderably warmer than the ice and was
as a matter of fact undoubtedly radiat-
ing heat into the ice instead of taking
it away the heat that would have to
be taken from say ten pounds of water
at  to make it freeze if put into an-
other smaller quantity of water would
turn the smaller quantity of water into
steam you see

  the steam plume  exclaimed the
reporter

 of course said teddy we
measure heat by calories usually
thats the amount of heat required to
raise a pound of wrater one degree
fahrenheit suppose you have a mass
of water to make it freeze you have
to take twenty thousand calories of heat
out of it suppose you take that heat
out youve got to do something with
it suppose you put it into another
smaller mass of water it will make
that second mass of water hot so hot
that it will turn into steam at a high
temperature

  then varrhus said the reporter
thoughtfully was taking the heat from
a big bunch of water and putting it
into a small bunch and the small bunch
went up in steam is that right

  precisely teddy turned to a file
on which hung a number of sheets of
paper covered with figures here are
the professors calculations we could
only figure approximately but we knew
the size and depth of the ice cake very
nearly the temperature of the water
that had been frozen and naturally it
was not hard to estimate the number
of calories that had had to be taken


a thousand degrees below zero

out of the harbor water to make the
ice cake to check up we figured out
how much water that number of calo-
ries would turn into steam the pro-
fessor appealed to the government sci-
entists who had watched the cake from
the first he found that from the size
of the plume and the other means of
checking its volume he had come within
ten per cent of calculating the amount
of water that had actually poured out
in the shape of steam

  but-but thats amazing said the
reporter

  it was good work teddy said in
some satisfaction then we knew
what varrhus had done and it re-
mained to find out how hed done it
nothing like that had ever happened
before he couldnt very well have an
engine working there in the water the
professor took to his mathematics
again assume that i have a stove
here that will make it just so warm at
a distance of five feet im leaving
warm air out of consideration now and
only thinking of radiated heat if i
put my themometer ten feet away how
much heat will i get 

  half as much asked the reporter

  one-quarter as much said teddy
or three times away ill get one-ninth
as much or four times away ill get
one-sixteenth as much you see if
i want to make the ends of an iron bar
hot and i can only heat the middle the
middle has to be red-hot or white-hot
to make the ends even warm if i have
to make the middle of a bar red-hot
to have the ends warm you see in order
to make the ends cold the middle would
have to be very cold indeed

  y-yes i understand

  well the professor worked on that
principle he knew the temperature
of the edges and he knew the size of
the ice cake it was easy to figure what
the temperature must be in the middle
it worked out to within two degrees of
absolute zero

  whats that

  there isnt any limit to high tem-
peratures you can go up two thou-
sand degrees three thousand four or
five some things almost certainly pro-
duce a temperature of as much as eight
thousand degrees but high tempera-
tures are produced by putting more heat
in-by stuffing the thing with calories
i make an iron bar red-hot by putting
calories in i make it cold by taking
calories out

  well

  if you keep that up you reach the
point where there arent any more cal-
ories left to take out when you get
to that point you have a temperature of
 centigrade or one thousand and
seventy-eight degrees fahrenheit below
zero thats absolute zero

  teddy spoke quite casually but the
reporter blinked

  rather chilly then

  rather teddy agreed but our
calculations told us that varrhus had
reachcd and was using a temperature
within two degrees of that in the cen-
ter of his ice cake and right next to
that temperature he had a very high
one as evidenced by the plume of
steam

  i cant see how you got anywhere
said the reporter hopelessly im all
mixed up

  its very simple said teddy cheer-
fully on one side of a wall the man
had what amounted to a thousand and
some odd degrees below zero on the
other he had probably as much above
zero evelyn-miss hawkins you
know-made the suggestion that solved
the problem she showed us this
teddy picked up what seemed to be
a square bit of opaque glass

  smoked glass

  yes and no teddy smiled you
cant see through it can you

  no

  come around to this side and look
a thousand degrees below zero



  the reporter made an exclamation of
astonishment

  its clear glass

  its a piece of glass on which a thin
film of platinum has been deposited
it lets light through in one direction
but not in the other evelyn suggested
that varrhus had something which did
the same thing with heat it would let
heat through in one direction but not
in the other of course if it would take
all the heat from the air on one side
and wouldnt let any come back from

the other-

  it would be cold 

  on one side the glass looks black
because it lets the light go through and
lets none come back the surface we
have assumed would be almost infi-
nitely cold because it would let heat go
through and would let none come back
we decided that varrhus had made a
hollow bomb of some shape or other
composed of this hypothetical material
heat from the outside would be radi-
ated into the interior because the sur-
face absorbed heat like this glass ab-
sorbs light it would act as a surface
at more than a thousand below zero
because something had to be done with
the heat that would come in varrhus
made the bomb hollow and left two
openings in it the inside of the bomb
is intensely hot from the heat that has
been taken out of the surrounding
water the hole at the bottom radiates
a beam  of heat straight downward
which melts a very small quantity of
ice and lets the water flow into the
bomb where it is turned into steam
naturally it flows out of the other
hole at the top there you have the
whole thing

 and you stopped it-

  by dropping a t n t bomb down
the steam shaft it went off and blew
the cold bomb to bits the iceberg
will break up and melt now

  the reporter stood up

  id like to thank you for this but

its too big he said feverishly man
just wait till i wave this before the city
editors eyes he rushed out of the
house

  the newspapers that afternoon had
frantic headlines announcing the de-
struction of the steam plume and the
fact that noticeable signs of melting
had begun to show themselves on the
ice cake smaller captions told of the
dynamiting that had beguri and of the
destruction of the yokohama and
folkestone bergs by soldiers acting on
cabled instructions the straits of
gibraltar were cleared by salvos fired
from the heavy- guns on the rock at
the three great plumes of steam the
world congratulated itself on the speedy
nullification of the menace to its dem-
ocratic governments it did not neg-
lect however to rush detachments of
men with trench mortars and hand
bombs to its reservoirs prepared to de-
stroy any possible cold bombs on their
first appearance the aviation forces
too made themselves ready to fight the
black flyer on its next appearance de-
spite the mysterious means by which
it had killed the american pilot

  this state of affairs lasted for pos-
sibly a week when within three hours
of each other the papers found two
occasions to issue extras the first ex-
tra announced the death by heart failure
of professor hawkins who had been
found by his daughter dead in his
laboratory holding in his hands an an-
tique silver bracelet he had just opened
at the clasp the second three hours
later announced the formation of an
ice cake in the narrows which grew
in size even more rapidly than the orig-
inal one and was entirely unattended
by the steam plume which gave teddy
gerrod an opportunity to destroy the
first within three hours the narrows
were closed and the ice floe was creep
ing up toward new york

  in rapid succession came the news
that norfolk harbor was frozen over


a thousand degrees below zero

and hampton roads closed that
charleston was blocked then jackson-
ville the next morning- delayed cable-
grams declared that the panama canal
was a mass of ice and almost simulta-
neously the straits of gibraltar were
again admitted to be firmly locked

chapter v

	 eddy put his hand comfortingly on
     evelyns shoulder

  there isnt anything i can say eve-
lyn he said avvkardly except that i
couldnt have loved him more if hed
been my own father and it hurts me
terribly to have him go like this

  evelyn looked up

  teddy she said bravely trying to
hold back her sobs ive been fearing
this for a long time but-i cant be-
lieve it wasnt caused bv that fearful
varrhus

  the professor did work very hard
over that problem admitted teddy

  i dont mean that the work he did
caused his heart to fail i mean i think
varrhus killed father evelyns eyes
were dark and troubled as she looked
at teddy gerrod

  but evelyn why do you think such
a thing you knew his heart was
weak

  tears came again into evelyns eyes
but she forced them back determinedly

  will you go upstairs and look at
his fingers-inside i was-crossing
his hands-on his breast please look

  teddy went soberly up the stairs to
where the professor lay quietly on the
led he was occupying for the last time
teddy turned back the sheet that cov-
ered the figure and looked at the gentle
old face a lump came in his throat
and he hastily turned his eyes away
he lifted the sheet until the professors
thin hands came into view he looked
at the fingers then lifted one of the
white hands and examined the inside
small but deep bums disfigured the

finger tips when teddy went down-
stairs his face was white and set and
a great anger burned in him

  you are right evelyn he said
grimly where is the bracelet he was
holding when he was found

  on the acids table he was lying
beside it when-when i saw him
evelyn was grief-stricken but she
forced herself to be calm do you
think you know what happened

  pm not sure

  teddy went quietly into the labora-
tory and found the massive silver
bracelet lying where evelyn had said
he looked at it carefully before he
touched it and when he lifted it it was
in a pair of wooden tongs

  that thermo-couple evelyn please
and start the small generator wont
you 

  the two worked on the bracelet for
half an hour then stopped and stared
at each other their suspicions con-
firmed

  varrhus said teddy slowly var-
rhus caused your fathers death this
earth has gotten too small for both
varrhus and me to live on

  he knew father could wreck his
plans evelyn said in a hard voice
and he wished to rule the world so
he killed my father

  teddys lips were compressed
before god he burst out before
god pm going to kill varrhus

  the bell rang and in a moment the
commandant of the forts was ushered
in

 mr gerrod miss hawkins he
nodded to them and then said they
tell me professor hawkins is dead
the narrows are frozen over again
hampton roads is frozen over
charleston is frozen over the pan-
ama canal is frozen over theres no
steam plume to blow up washington
is worried theyre calling me to clear
cut the channel the navy department
is going crazy if it were a case of
a thousand degrees below zero



fighting men id know something but
i cant fight a chemical combination
whats to be done since the professor
is dead who on earth can fill his
place 

  he looked from one to the other al-
ready beginning to show the strain un-
der which he was laboring

  professor hawkins said teddy
quietly was murdered by varrhus
some four hours ago

  murdered varrhus has been
here

  no varrhus has not been here hut
we may be able to trace him ill get
the police then well talk about ice
floes we know varrhus method now
well soon be able to anticipate him
but in the meantime the com-
mandant snapped angrily hell play
the devil with the world

  well play the devil with him when
he is caught said teddy evenly ive
no intention of letting varrhus get
away just now theres a possibility
of catching him in the ordinary way
he mailed a present to the professor
an antique bracelet ancient jewelry
was the professors hobby he exam-
ined the bracelet and died

  i heard he was dead said the com-
mandant restlessly the paper said
heart failure

  so did the doctor teddy took
down the receiver of the telephone
give me police emergency please

  in a few moments he hung up again
the statement that professor hawkins
had been murdered and that there was
a chance of catching varrhus was all
he needed to say hardly five minutes
had passed before the commissioner of
police himself was in the room with
two of his keenest men

  youll have to explain what hap-
pened he said at once to teddy
when news of the professors death
came i phoned at once to the doctor
mentioned in the paper and asked if
there were any possibility of foul play
btb

to tell the truth id been rather afraid

something like this might happen
what was it 

  varrhus electrocuted the professor
by an antique bracelet

  he handed over the ornament the
commissioner examined it gingerly

  nothing funny about this except the
workmanship

  and the surface said teddy his
set calm was surprising himself it
looks as if it had been lacquered thats
varrhus secret

  what is it  a powerful battery

  teddy turned to the materials with
which he and evelyn had been work-
ing

  ill show you heres an instru-
ment that measures the resistance of
a given coil this is one of the pro-
fessors evaporation machines for pro-
ducing low temperatures quickly he
evaporates ether in this sheath that
surrounds this oven and objects in the
oven are cooled far below freezing
point look at this coil of silver wire
we measure the resistance at room
temperature one hundred and twenty
ohms it is very fine wire we put
it in the cooling oven and set the en-
gines going-- for some minutes
there was silence while the small elec-
tric pump thumped and rattled now
well take the coil out the thermom-
eter inside the oven says twelve below
zero teddy handled the small coil
of silver wire with thick gloves well
measure the resistance again four-
teen and a half ohms resistance ap-
proximately low temperatures de-
crease resistance and increase the con-
ductivity of metals you see

  yes but why-

  the inside of that bracelet is nine
hundred degrees below zero the
whole thing is coated with varrhus
lacquer which in this case radiates all
the heat from the inside out leaving it
incredibly cold within that cold
x

a thousand degrees below zero

makes the silver conduct electricity bet-
ter

  well 

  at eight hundred degrees below zero
fahrenheit silver has no measurable
resistance to the passage of an electric
current now watch

  teddy laid the bracelet on top of a
frame wound with many turns of glis-
tening copper wire pie threw on a
switch and a small generator at one
side of the laboratory began to run with
a humming pur

  eddy currents are whirling all
around that bracelet a strong current
is running in an endless circle in that
closed circuit of silver nine hundred
degrees below zero silver at that tem-
perature offers no resistance to an elec-
tric current closed circuits have been
left at that degree of cold for over four
hours and at the end of that time the
electric current was still flowing round
and round like a squirrel in a cage
teddy picked up the bracelet with a
pair of wooden tongs he took a sec-
ond pair in his other hand rubber
handles insulated the tongs from their
handles

  theres a current flowing around
the inside of this bracelet there was
one flowing around it when the profes-
sor received it in the mail he opened
it with his bare hands suspecting noth-
ing i open it with these insulated
tongs watch

  he jerked on the two tongs the
bracelet parted at the catch and a daz-
zling blinding flash of light appeared
with a sharp crackle at the parting

i made the current jump the gap
the professor took it through his body
and it killed him are you satisfied
god said the commissioner of po-
lice aghast

  the box and wrapper said one of
the men who had come with the com-
missioner let us have the box and
wrapper the bracelet came in and well
get the man that mailed it but well

handle him with tongs too when we
close in on him

  they took what they wanted and left
teddy turned to the commandant

  now sir well see what can be done
about the new berg you say theres
no plume of steam have you had an
aeroplane fly above it to make sure
yes the pilot says the whole ice
cake is covered with mist except for
a round spot in the middle but theres
no sign of a steam plume

  teddy nodded at evelyn

  no holes in this cold bomb i won-
der what happens to all the heat that
comes in

  father mentioned that he expected
something of the sort but didnt say
what he thought could be done about
it

  the same as we did with the other
i suppose said teddy reflectively
only this time well have to blast down
to the bomb and then break it up

   set men to work if youll find
the bomb said the commandant

  almost any one could find it
teddy remarked but there are going
to be some queer difficulties when you
get near the cold bomb if youll allow
me id like to be at hand when it is
broken up i may really be of use
there

  he began to pick out instruments he
thought he might need among other
things he took what seemed to be two
silvered globes with small necks they
were dewey bulbs several low-tem-
perature thermometers and a thermo
couple connected with a delicate galva-
nometer completed his preparations

  the two men left the house and
started for the launch that would take
them to the forts on the way teddy
was asking crisp questions about the
explosives he could have placed at his
disposal quite ignorant of what was
happening at that moment in jackson-
ville

  the river there was a mass of ice
a thousand degrees below zero



from one shore to the other all the
little reedy islands and the swampy
shores were frozen solidly to see the
slender palm trees rising from icy
shores their reflections visible on the
narrow strip of mist-free ice that ran
along the shores of the river was an
anomaly to see fur-clad tourists
stepping out of the tropical foliage to
step gingerly out on the ice just to
say theyd done it was even more
strange at the moment however in-
terest centered on a little group of sol-
diers out in the central clearing in the
cloud of mist they were bundled in
furs and swathed in numberless gar-
ments until they looked like fat pen-
guins or some strange afctic animals
a major of engineers was waving them
to the right and left forward and back
until they stood at equal distance
around the clearing each man moved
backward until the mist that rose grad-
ually from the ice reached his waist
then at a whistle signal from the ma-
jor they began to move forward to-
ward a common center the major
had reasoned that the cold bomb must
be precisely underneath the exact cen-
ter of the clearing and this was a
rough-and-ready means of finding that
center they advanced toward each
other and as they went nearer the cen-
ter of the clearing the cold grew more
intense infinitesimal ice crystals glit-
tered in little clouds where the moisture
of their breath froze instantly in the
terrific cold at a second whistle from
the major they halted they formed
a fairly even circle about forty yards
across each man began to stamp and
fling his arms about to keep from freez-
ing in that more than frigid atmosphere
no man could have stood that cold
no matter how hardy he might be for
more than a very few moments the
major trotted around the circle mark-
ing the place where each man stood
four small sledge loads of explosives
stood out in the clearing the major

intended to blast down toward the cold
bomb with them

  the major was marking the position
of the last man completing his circle
under which the cold bomb must lie
when a peculiar tremor was felt by
every man there it was not like the
shiver of an earthquake or the rever-
beration of an explosion it was an
infinitely shrill vibration that a moment
later was followed by a creaking sound
that seemed to come from the center
of the ice cake the men on the ice
stopped their stamping and swinging of
arms to listen in instinctive apprehen-
sion

  the center of the circle around which
they stood seemed to rise in the air
the ice on which they stood was shiv-
ered into tinv fragments a colossal
and implacable roar filled the air and
a great sheet of flame of the unearthly
tint of a vaporized metal rose to the
heavens the swathed and bundled
soldiers were annihilated by the blast
a great hole five hundred feet across
gaped in the center of the ice cake
jacksonville shook from the concus-
sion and the plate-glass windows of its
stores and office buildings splintered
into a myriad tiny bits that sprinkled
all its streets with sharp-edged jagged
pieces

  teddy gerrod all unconscious of the
fate of those who had attempted to
meddle with the jacksonville ice cake
went on out to bare and blast open the
cold bomb that blocked new york har-
bor

chapter vi

fthddy gerrod straightened up
    and beat his hands together

  forty-seven below he said to the
soldier behind him put a marker
here

  he moved off to the right already
a dozen little flags showed where the
temperature reached that degree
teddy was drawing what he would


a thousand degrees below zero

have termed an isothermal line-a line
where the temperature was the same
he was making a circle about a large
part of the open clearing on the ice
floe other flags led back into the mist
marking a path and from time to time
a party of four or five fur-clad sol-
diers arrived from the fort dragging
a loaded sledge behind them they
emptied the load from the sled turned
and vanished into the mist again a
small pile of drills explosives and two
of the squat trench mortars had al-
ready been made

  when the circle of little red flags
had been completed two signal-corps
men set up their instruments and accu-
rately located the center directly un-
der that spot if teddys reasoning was
correct the new cold bomb was resting
the sledge from the fort arrived again
bearing a curious trench catapult for
flinging bombs four long strips of
black cloth were unrolled under direc-
tion of the signal-corps men pointing
accurately to the center of the circle
no one had been able to approach
nearer thus far than thirty yards from
the center at that distance teddys
thermo couple indicated a temperature
of more than seventy-two degrees be-
low zero and flesh exposed to the air
was frostbitten on the instant what
the temperature of the air might be di-
rectly above the cold bomb could only
be conjectured

  one of the infantry men from the
fort the best grenade man in the gar-
rison now picked up a mills grenade
and after carefully picking out the tar-
get with his eye aided by the strips of
black cloth flung the small missile a
hole perhaps four feet deep and twice
as much across was blasted in the brittle
ice a second third and fourth gre-
nade followed at the end of that time
the size and depth of the hole had been
doubled

  the trench catapult was set up half
a dozen grenades were bundled together

and flung into the now much enlarged
opening in the surface of the ice
there was no explosion one automat-
ically braced oneself for the report and
the utter silence that succeeded the dis-
appearance of the grenades came as a
peculiar shock

  too cold remarked teddy to the
young lieutenant in charge

   the lieutenant nodded stiffly

   well try again

   a second batch of grenades was flung
into the hole and the same quiet re-
sulted

  i would suggest- teddy began

  well fire a trench-mortar bomb
said the young lieutenant

  the heavy winged projectile flew up
into the air and then descended
squarely into the opening in the ice
those standing fifty yards away could
hear the crash as it struck and then
a sound as of musical splintering the
young lieutenant swore

  the fuses are no good try once
more

  you can shoot all day and they
wont go off said teddy mildly its
too cold down there

   the officer said nothing but super-
vised the firing of a second mortar
bomb with precisely the same result
he swore again

   its probably quite as cold as liquid
air down there said teddy in fact
theres quite possibly a pool of liquified
air at the bottom of the hole your
bombs fall into that air and are frozen
so solidly before they strike that the
metal gets brittle and simply falls to
powder from the shock you cant do
anything going on this way

   the young lieutenant hesitated then
turned to teddy somewhat sulkily

  what do you suggest then

   wed better enlarge the hole first
blast down the walls of the present
cavity then use wrapped dynamite until
we have a shallow crater then well
place our explosives by long poles
a thousand degrees below zero



keeping them warm by running resist-
ance wires around them and heating
them electrically

  the young lieutenant considered and
agreed teddy went back to the fort
to arrange for the heated bomb and
the long poles when he returned there
was only a saucerlike depression in
the ice clearing it was quite fifty
yards across but no more than twenty
deep standing near the edge one
could see the ice near the bottom glis-
tening liquidly air liquified by the in-
tense cold at the bottom of the crater
wet the surface of the ice there

  and that means the temperature
down there is three hundred and
twenty-five degrees or more below zero
fahrenheit explained teddy casually
heres where we use our heated ex-
plosives

  for an hour the party worked busily
storage batteries brought out on sledges
furnished the current that kept the ex-
plosives from becoming inert through
cold charge after charge was fired
and the bottom of the crater grew
steadily deeper at the lowest point a
little puddle of liquified air collected

  we must be pretty nearly at the
cold bomb now said teddy thought-
fully theres a ma ss of liquid air
at the bottom of our crater and some-
thing tells me theres solidified air at
the bottom of that puddle that means
seven hundred-odd degrees below zero
he was clad in the warmest garments
that could be found and every one of
the others working in the clearing was
quite as warmly clothed but the cold
was intense one of the soldiers by the
small pile of explosives was chewing a
fud of tobacco he spat the brown-
ish liquid froze in mid-air and bounced
merrily away across the ice the sol-
dier looked at it with his mouth open
then shut it quickly a thin film of
ice had formed from the moisture on
his teeth the breast of every mem-
ber of the party was covered with spar-

kling snow crystals from the congealed
moisture of their breath

  i begin to doubt if we can keep our
stuff from freezing much deeper
teddy commented we want to go
down as deep as we can before we use
our dewey bulbs though ive only
two of them

  the young lieutenant bustled away
and presently returned

  the men say that the last bomb
wont go off he said aggrievedly
your heating plan doesnt work

  i didnt expect it to work indefi-
nitely said teddy mildly we want
to clear out that liquid air and shoot
our two dewey globes before its had
time to reform will you please have a
charge made ready to be fired just
above the surface of that puddle that
should clear it away immediately
after that charge has gone off well drop
our two t n t charges in the dewey
bulbs they ought to show us the cold
bomb

  the dynamite charge was suspended
about a foot above the surface of the
watery bubbling pool air was in that
pool air turned to transparent liquid
by the intense cold at - fahren-
heit air becomes a liquid here ex-
posed to the sunlight and the blue sky
a pool of liquified gas had collected
from the incredible cold of the cold
bomb below the charge of explosive
burst with a shattering roar the
echoes of the explosion had not died
away when the two dewey bulbs filled
with t n t fell into the bared ice
cavity a dewey bulb is a combination
of six vacuum bottles placed one out-
side the other they are used for the
keeping of liquid gases at a low tem-
perature but are obviously just as effec-
tive in protecting their contents from
exterior cold they fell some five
yards apart and rolled then were still
their fuses sputtered they went off
together a huge mass of shattered ice
was thrown aside and a dark globular


a thousand degrees below zero

mass was exposed to view almost
as soon as it was exposed to the air a
crust of frozen air coated it and liqui-
fied air began to trickle down its mis-
shapen sides there could be no doubt
but that it was the cold bomb invented
by an insane genius to make him mas-
ter of the world

  those about the rim of the crater
looked at it and turned away just
as the intense heat of a blast furnace
sears unprotected flesh even yards
from its flame so the incredible cold
of the dark object pinched and wrung
with its freezing rays not one man
who looked upon the cold bomb but suf-
fered from a deep frostbite

  we cant approach that thing said
teddy with his hand over his eyes
id just as soon or sooner try to
tinker with burning thermit well
have to shoot armor-piercing shells at
it theyll freeze when they get near
it but the impact ought to crack the
thing

  he motioned to the fur-clad soldiers
to move back from the crater and after
a hasty consultation wfth the lieutenant
went off toward the fort to ask for
a small-caliber field gun

  the lieutenant paced back and forth
restlessly he was an ambitious young
man he did not relish taking orders
from a civilian like teddy his eye
fell on the heap of equipment that had
been brought out from the fort two
trench mortars a trench catapult a
liquid-flame apparatus-one of the
american inventions that had far out-
done the original german flamcnwer-
fers there had been some thought
of trying to reach a point just above
the cold bomb and melting the ice down
to it with liquid flame that had been
quickly proven impracticable but the
liquid fire apparatus had not been sent
back the young lieutenant wras not
stupid on the contrary he was a sin-
gularly intelligent man in a flash he
saw how the liquid flame could have

been used much more efficiently than
teddys resistance coils about his ex-
plosive charges the idea simply had
not occurred to teddy or the young
lieutenant either now however he
became all eagerness if he succeeded
in breaking up the cold bomb during
teddys absence it would be a feather
in his cap if in addition he pointed
out a method of dealing with the cold
bombs superior to teddys plodding
system it would certainly mean his
promotion and a very desirable reputa-
tion for himself in his profession

  he gave his orders briskly the
liquid-flame tank was set up and be-
gan to spray out its stream of fire
the young lieutenant had it trained so
that it passed just above the top of the
ungainly cold bomb and grazed the up-
per edge then the two trench mor-
tars were made ready for firing the
young lieutenant set them at their
proper elevation himself he was tre-
mendously excited he pointed the two
mortars with the most meticulous pre-
cision to aim them properly he had
to expose his face again and again to
the direct rays from the cold bomb but
he paid no attention to the searing
freezing rays

  the stream of liquid fire shot up-
ward in a perfect parabola and fell
evenly exactly where it was aimed
the young lieutenant knew that a mor-
tar bomb would be frozen by the in-
tense cold if it were fired at the cold
bomb direct but his plan got around
that difficulty with the liquid fire
playing just above and grazing the cold
bomb when the shell from the mortar
struck the incredibly cold surface both
the shell and the cold bomb would be
bathed in flame

  all was ready the lieutenant fixed
his eyes on the cold bomb and gave the
signal the two small trench mortars
spouted flame two ungainly bombs
rose high in the air and fell hurtling
down toward the strange frosted ob-
a thousand degrees below zero



ject at the bottom of the crater one
of the bombs would fall a little to the
left the other-squarely on top

  the cracking explosion of the bomb
from the trench mortar was lost in the
greater roar that followed it before
the young lieutenant or any of his men
could lift a finger they were enveloped
by a colossal sheet of vaporized metal
that seemed to fill the earth the air
and all the sky of a weird and un-
earthly tint the white-hot flame leaped
into the air it sprang up three thou-
sand feet in hardly more than two sec-
onds the blast had the velocity of
many rifle balls and the withering heat
of molten metal the young lieutenant
and his men were swept into nothing-
ness in the fraction of a second the
crater they had worked for hours to
blast out was as a puny ant hole beside
the vast chasm that opened in the ice
down to the red clay far beneath the
bed of the narrows and new york
shook and trembled from the shock of
the terrific explosion

chapter vii

r j eddy was thrown down by the con-
cussion and fell in a heap against
the commandant he leaped to his feet
and rushed to the window from which
the glass had disappeared he saw the
remnants of the sheet of flame dying
away and saw that the low-lying cloud
of mist had been blown from the sur-
face of the ice a gaping orifice five
hundred feet across showed itself
where teddy and the lieutenant had
been working of the lieutenant and
his men no trace could be seen two
or three of the little red flags that had
marked the path through the mist still
remained however and a small sledge
was lying overturned beside the sledge
route four tiny black figures lay in
twisted attitudes beside the sledge as
teddy looked one of them began to
struggle feebly

  teddy stared speechless for a mo-
ment he was dazed by the suddenness
and the overwhelming nature of the
calamity that had befallen the young
lieutenant and his detachment only
accident had saved him from a similar
fate then his professional instinct re-
asserted itself and he began to piece
together what he knew of the bomb
in a moment the solution came to him

  varrhus planned this he said un-
steadily he filled up his hollow cold
bombs with solid iron the heat that
would come in would first melt and
then vaporize the interior until the pres-
sure inside was more than the still-
solid crust could stand and all that
vaporized iron would burst out what
a fiend that man must be

  an hour later baffled and discour-
aged he was sitting in the laboratory
with his head in his hands trying des-
perately to grapple with this new prob-
lem the new cold bombs apparently
could not be assailed without destruc-
tion of those who attacked them it
was impossible to imagine that volun-
teers could be found to sacrifice their
lives to destroy each new bomb as it
was placed the horror of being anni-
hilated by a blast of metallic vapor
would deter men who would not hesi-
tate to face death in a less terrible form
and varrhus was evidently able to
place them again nearly as fast as they
were blown up telegrams announcing
the explosion of the jacksonville and
charleston ice floes lay before teddy
supplemented by a cablegram from pan-
ama saying that the miraflores locks
had been destroyed by the blast when
the panama cold bomb had burst
teddy was nearly certain that the next
morning would find the exploded bombs
replaced varrhus black flyer was evi-
dently capable of carrying a great
weight at an immense speed it also
seemed able to reach an almost incredi-
ble height from the fact that the second
cold bomb had been dropped in the


a thousand degrees below zero

narrows in broad daylight without the
fiver having been sighted

  evelyn turned from the instruments
with which she had been working she
had scraped off a small bit of the lac-
querlike surface of the silver bracelet
and had been analyzing it in the hope
of finding what element or combination
had been used to produce the mystify-
ing heat-inductive effect

  teddy she said depressedly i
cant find a thing the lacquer effect
seems to be simply the appearance of
some way he has treated the metal
the surface gives just the same analy-
sis as the filings from the inside of the
metal i took a spectro photo and it
gives silver lines with a trace of lead
analysis by arsenic reduction gives the
same result

  perhaps those detectives will be able
to trace varrhus by the mailing box
they took said teddy without much
hope its not very likely though
weve got to think of something
silence fell in the laboratory again
broken only by the faint whistling
sound of the flame evelyn had used
in her analytical work

  the trouble is said teddy grimlv
that weve been trailing varrhus in-
stead of anticipating him if we could

know where he was going to be-

  hell have to show up sooner or
later evelyn commented we know
for instance that hell have to replace
that bomb in the narrows or let the
harbor stay open the use of these
new explosive bombs means that he
has to expose himself more than hed
have to with the old ones

  there ought to be an aerial patrol

above the city-

  teddy stood up sluggishly discour-
agement in every line of his figure a
servant tapped on the door of the labor-
atory

  lieutenant davis of the military
flying corps sir

  show him in said teddy listlessly

  a slim young officer came in his
friendly boyish face was full of a
whimsical humor

  this is rather an intrusion fm
afraid he said half apologetically but
i thought you might be able to help me
out

  ive done nothing so far said
teddy in a rather discouraged tone
miss hawkins and i were just can-
vassing the situation youre talking
about the iceberg and varrhus arent
you 

  of course no one talks about
anything else nowadays my taxi had
a tough time getting through the crowds
on the streets they dont understand
about the explosion in the narrows
yet

  teddy introduced him to evelyn

  pleasure fm sure said davis with
a smile then his face sobered that
wras rotten hard luck about your father
miss hawkins fm not good at mak-
ing speeches but i hope you realize
that every one is sympathizing with you
and in a measure sharing your sorrow

  evelyn shook hands

  i will allow myself to grieve when
varrhus has been disposed of she
said quietly until then i dare not
let myself think

  davis released her hand and turned
to teddy

  varrhus-or the chap in the black
flyer anyway-killed my best friend
curtiss he was driving the little nieu-
port that attacked varrhus the day you
blew up the first bomb i was the first
man to reach the spot where curtiss
had crashed and i swore id get var-
rhus for that

 i remember said teddy
frozen

  davis nodded his face grave

  i have what is probably the fastest
little machine in the united states at
the fort a two-seater with twin lib-
erty motors that shoot her up to a hun-
dred and fifty miles an hour without
a thousand degrees below zero



any trouble at all i think i can get
varrhus with it i came to you to learn
what you think about varrhus weap-
ons its only the part of wisdom to
learn all you can about your opponent
you know

  teddy found the young man impress-
ing him very favorably

  i havent given the matter much
thought he confessed but you re-
member varrhus tactics 

  he dropped like a tumbler pigeon
said davis and curtiss overshot him
there wasnt a sign of firing except
from curtiss he simply overran the
place where varrhus had been three
or four seconds before and then
dropped he was frozen stiff when i
found him

  i think said teddy carefully that
varrhus had shot up a jet of some
liquified gas probably hydrogen it
hung suspended in the air for a mo-
ment and in that moment the biplane
ran into it a drop of liquid hydrogen
placed in the palm of your hand would
freeze your arm solidly up well past
the elbow its something over five
hundred degrees below zero your
friend ran into what amounted to a
shower of it

  davis considered

  cheerful thing to fight against isnt
it he asked with a smile tactics
mustnt run above the black flyer and
mustnt run below it he can probably
shoot it straight down too

 and almost certainly from the
sides said teddy the man must
have been working on this thing for
years and even if hes insane hed be
a fool not to make his weapon as effi-
cient as possible

  davis expression became rueful
and so im supposed to keep my
distance he remarked and take pot
shots at him while dancing merrily
around in mid-air cant we do any-
thing about that stuff to nullify it
bum it suggested evelyn liquid

hydrogen burns just as readily as the
same gas at normal temperatures

  the three of them were silent for a
moment

  would rockets set it afire asked
davis presently i could keep a stream
of fire balls shooting out before my
machine

  they ought to teddy was losing
his discouragement in this new prospect
of coming to grips with varrhus i
say will your machine burn readily
only the gas tank the wings and
struts are fireproof new process
davis stood up suddenly

  would it bother you to come over
and look at my machine we could
probably figure out the thing better
then 

  teddy rose almost enthusiastically
well go over now if you say so
the taxicab bearing teddy and the
young aviator down to the fort was
forced to travel slowly amid the throngs
of apprehensive people that overflowed
the sidewalks and made the streets al-
most impassable the launch took
them swiftly to the fort and in a few
moments they had arrived at the small
aviation field behind the fortifications
on staten island davis led teddy di-
rectly to the shed that contained the
swift machine of which he was so
proud it was a splendid product of
the air-craft makers art twin lib-
erty motors developed nearly eight hun-
dred horse power between them and
two great shining propellers pulled the
machine through the air with irresisti-
ble force

  you see said davis with some
enthusiasm the motors arent in the
fusilage so the gunner sits up here in
the bow and can fire freely in any
direction the one-man planes with
synchronized machine guns firing
through the propeller arent in it with
these for real fighting theyre splen-
did little machines-i drove one in
france-but i honestly believe this is


a thousand degrees below zero

better than they are this one responds
to the controls every bit as readily

and with a good gunner-

  machine gunner in france myself
said teddy touching his breast
would you take a chance on letting
me sit up front to-night

  to-night asked davis

  i believe varrhus will appear to
drop another cold bomb to-night it
will probably be dropped inside the har-
bor so the ice cake will touch the bat-
tery that will set the people frantic
and make them beg the government to
enter into a parley with varrhus its
paid no official attention to him so far
you know

  davis expression became keen and
rather stern

  weve four hours before dark
well have to set to work

teddy went over and stepped up the
ladder that leaned against the cockpit

  i want to see your gasoline supply
he remarked in a moment he came
down looking a trifle dubious if im
right about varrhus using liquid hydro-
gen for a weapon and we can set it
afire well dive through half a dozen
sheets of flame to-night something
will have to be done to protect that gas
tank from catching fire and some pro-
tection for the carburetors too

  well fix that in a hurry said davis
briskly oh simpson  come here
in twenty minutes there were half a
dozen mechanicians at work and teddy
was carefully inspecting the machine
gun at the bow of the fusilage

  teddy telephoned back to evelyn
what he anticipated would occur that
night and his own share in it

  of course theres some risk in it
he finished but i guess well come out
evelyns voice was more anxious
than teddy had expected

  do be careful teddy she said in
a worried tone please be very care-
ful varrhus has so many fiendish
weapons im terribly afraid

  teddys voice was grim

  with the kind assistance of the
german government he remarked
we have a few fiendish inventions too
im using explosive bullets only to-
night varrhus is outlawed

  evelyn spoke almost faintly

  but take good care of yourself
please teddy she urged it were
better that varrhus got away this once
than that you should be killed for noth-
ing

  teddy smiled ive no intention of
being killed evelyn but i have some
intention that varrhus shall be

  there was a curious sound from the
other end of the wire

  but-but- evelyns voice died

away im-im going to be praying
teddv good-bv

  the last was very faint teddy
turned from the instrument and went
out to where the aeroplane had been
rolled from its shed the sun was sink-
ing and dusk was falling time passed
and darkness settled down upon the
earth stars twinkled into being a
long searchlight poked a tentative fin-
ger of light into the sky

  wed better be going said davis
thoughtfully we wrant to be well up
before he appears

  teddy clambered up to his seat and
adjusted the straps fhat would hold him
in place he pulled down the helmet
and fitted the telephone receivers
securely over his ears a telephone
was necessary for communication with
davis four feet behind him because
of the tremendous roar of the engines
he took the machine-gun butt and
found the trigger then made sure the
first of a belt of cartridges was in place
he settled back in his seat as the me-
chanics began to twirl the propellers
he was going out to fight the black
flyer but most incongruously he was
not thinking of varrhus at all his
thoughts dwelt with strange intensity
upon evelyn
a thousand degrees below zero



chapter viii

mew york lay below them the
long straight lines of lights shin-
ing up through the semidarkness of the
moonlit night made a strange appear-
ance to the two in the swift machine
davis had mounted to a great height
some ten thousand feet and the pin
points of light outlined more than a
dozen cities and towns the hudson
was a faintly silvery ribbon flowing
down placidly from a far-distant
source because of the ice cake in the
narrows its level had risen two or
three feet but now it flowed smoothly
over that great obstacle melting and
carrying it away toward the sea

  the fighting plane roared around in
huge circles seeming strangely alone in
the vast expanse of air one search-
light from below moved restlessly about
the sky a second joined it then a
third one by one a dozen or more
of long pencillike beams of light shot
up into the sky and moved here and
there in seeming confusion but actually
according to a carefully prearranged
plan a hooded red light showed be-
low the biplane in which teddy and
davis were awaiting some sign of the
black flyer that had been agreed
upon and none of the searchlight beams
flashed upon the circling machine
from time to time davis shut off the
motors and the two of them lifted the
ear flaps of their helmets to listen
eagerly for the musical humming that
would herald varrhus approach

  far to the east they could see where
the faintly luminous waters of the
ocean came up to and stopped at the
darker masses of the land the harbor
below them glittered in the moonlight
the only peculiarity in the scene was
the absence of the little harbor craft
that ply about busily by day and night
upon their multifarious errands they
were all securely docked the wharves
too were dark and silent all the

maritime industry of new york was
at a standstill

  a wide spiral to twelve thousand feet
the motors were hushed during a two-
thousand-feet glide while the two men
in the machine listened intently for
twyo hours this maneuver had been re-
peated and re-repeated no sound save
the rush of the wind through the guy
wires and past the struts had broken
the chilly stillness of the heights the
sky was a blue dome of a myriad wink-
ing lights a pale silver moon shone
down

  the nose of the machine pointed
down and the motors ceased to roar
faintly but unmistakably above the
whistling and rushing of the wind about
the surfaces of the biplane a deep
musical humming could be heard ab-
ruptly the motors burst into life again
the exhausts began to bellow out their
reassuring thunder the machine be-
gan to climb again circling to every
point of the compass while teddy and
davis scanned the sky keenly for a
sign of the black flyer with its cargo
of menace to new york

  fm going to fifteen thousand

  davis voice sounded with metallic
clearness in teddys ear the tele-
phones between the two helmets were
working perfectly

  that was varrhus all right  said
teddy quietly did you signal to the
people beneath 

  davis pushed a button and a green
light glowed beside the red one in the
hood below the machine in a moment
the receipt of this signal by those be-
low was evidenced the searchlights
took up their task with renewed vigor
searching the sky frantically for a sign
of the black flying machine the hood
below the biplane allowed the signal
to be seen by those on the ground but
made the light invisible to any one in
the air the biplane swung in wide
circles teddy and davis with every
nerve taut and every sense alert aflame


a thousand degrees below zero

with eagerness to sight their quarry
they saw it outlined for an instant by
the white beam of one of the circling
lights

  it was dropping like a stone from
the clouds the searchlight rays glis-
tened from polished black sides and
were reflected from shimmering pro-
peller blades above it

  helicopter said davis crisply
now r

  the black flyer was a thousand feet
below them and still falling the nose
of the biplane dipped sharply and it
dived straight for the still falling ma-
chine teddy gripped the machine gun
and sighted along the barrel down
down the biplane darted all the power
of its eight hundred horse power aid-
ing in the speed of its fall the glis-
tening black machine checked in its drop
and hung motionless in mid air the
pilot was evidently unconscious of the
machine swooping down upon him

  five hundred feet down six hun-
dred- teddy pulled hard on the

trigger and his machine gun spurted
fire a stream of explosive projectiles
sped toward the menacing black shape
teddy saw them strike the shining sides
of the machine and explode with little
bursts of flame the biplane was rush-
ing with incredible speed toward the
other flyer teddy played his machine
gun upon it as he might have played
a hose and apparently with as little
effect the tiny explosive shells struck
and flashed futilely the black flyer
seemed to be unharmed after a sec-
onds hesitation it dropped again ab-
ruptly the biplane shot toward the
spot the other machine had occupied
the distance was too short to turn or
swerve quickly as it responded to the
controls

  flares gasped davis but before he
spoke teddy was pressing the small
button that would set them off

  a burst of tiny lights shot out be-
fore the biplane many-colorcd balls of

fire driven forward from a tube below
the fusilage they illuminated the air
for a short distance entering the space
from wrhich the black flyer had just
dropped teddy and davis saw a small
cloud of what seemed to be mist or
fog hanging in the air the tiny fire
balls darted into it the fraction of a
second before the biplane itself had to
traverse the same space as the first
of the lights struck the fringe of the
whitish cloud it flared up the fire
ball had touched a droplet of liquified
gas and set it flaming it burned
fiercely and with incredible rapidity
setting fire to the remainder of the
cloud teddy ducked his head as the
aeroplane shot madly through a huge
globe of blazing gas in mid-air

  great god gasped davis now
wheres varrhus

  the heavy masks the two aviators
had worn had protected them from the
flaming hydrogen and their goggles
had saved their eyes now davis was
only eager to make a second attempt
upon the black machine he swrerved
and circled the searchlights below
were waving frantically through the air
the flare aloft had been seen and they
concentrated upon the space below the
spot in a second the black flyer was
once more outlined by half a dozen
beams davis banked sharply and
darted toward it again

  the pilot of the strange machine
seemed to be quite confident that he
had disposed of his antagonist and was
apparently busy with something inside
the cabin he was probably preparing
to release his cold bomb but was again
interrupted the biplane approached
teddy saw his explosive bullets strike
and flash he knew they struck but
they seemed incapable of doing harm
the black flyer was clearly defined by
the searchlights and teddy could see
it distinctly it was a long needlelike
body with a glass-inclosed cabin near
the center above it four whirring disks
a thousand degrees below zero



of comparatively huge size showed the
position of the vertical propellers that
enabled it to rise and fall and to hang
suspended motionless in the air a fifth
propeller spun slowly at the bow that
was evidently not running at full speed
below the needlelike body hung a mis-
shapen globe like the bulging ovipositor
of some strange insect

  flash flash the impact of the
explosive bullets was marked by spite-
ful cracks as they burst teddy was
aiming for the cabin of the machine

  got him he exclaimed

  the glass of the cabin windows had
splintered into fragments the aero-
plane shot toward the motionless black
flyer

  shall i ram asked davis in a per-
fectly even voice he was quite pre-
pared to sacrifice both his and teddys
lives to make absolutely certain of the
destruction of the menacing helicopter
with its more than dangerous occupant

  teddy with lips compressed nodded
he had forgotten that in the darkness
davis could not see his movement as
the biplane sped forward the black ma-
chine dropped again again the whitish
cloud was left behind it clearly defined
in the searchlight rays teddy had
barely time to press the flare button be-
fore they reached the cloud the mist
of atomized liquid hydrogen seemed to
burst into flame all about them the
aeroplane roared through hell-fire for
a moment flame was before teddys
aviators goggles he was in a veritable
inferno then the aeroplane shot free
again

  ram him panted teddy smash
him do anything only weve got to
get him v

  they circled swiftly searching for the
black flyer the searchlights were fol-
lowing him now and they saw that he
was rising straight up he had not yet
dropped his cold bomb davis put his
machine at the ascent at as steep an
angle as he dared they climbed al-

most as rapidly as the helicopter the
black machine made its first aggressive
move now davis was climbing in 
jerky spiral rising at an amazing speed
teddy was busily fitting a new belt of
cartridges into his machine gun the
pilot of the other machine darted to one
side and a huge cloud of mist sprang
into being just below him darting
downward like some pale-gray snake
unfolding itself in the sky davis
zoomed sharply another second and he
would have run into the whitish cloud
the biplane recovered and swerved to
one side twelve thousand feet thir-
teen thousand feet fourteen thousand
feet three miles in the air then the
black flyer began to drop the biplane
dived after him teddys machine gun
spitting fire and explosive bullets in a
furious well-directed blast once
twice bursts of the little flashes that
showed his bullets were striking served
to reassure teddy but the biplane could
not gain on the falling helicopter

  down down- there were half a

dozen quick bursts of flame in the air
antiaircraft guns were firing the
black flyer dropped unharmed barely
a thousand feet above the waters of
the bay the propeller at the bow seemed
to be put into motion for the straight
descent changed into a graceful curve
the curve flattened out and the black
machine ceased to fall it sped madly
for the narrowrs with a bedlam of
bursting shells all about it and the
vengeful spitting two-seater darting
after it like an avenging nemesis
again and again spurts of flame against
the body of the glistening helicopter
showed that teddys fire was well di-
rected but the machine shot onward
in a furious rush for the narrows
above the narrows without pausing a
black object that turned to white in
the searchlight rays fell from the mis-
shapen globe below the center of the
black flyers body the thing that fell
seemed to leave a mist of fog behind it


a thousand degrees below zero

as it dropped then its mission ac-
complished die dark machine fled to-
ward the west

  teddy and davis in the biplane sped
after it at the topmost speed of which
their aeroplane was capable teddy
was nearly insane with baffled rage and
disappointment he knew that he had
failed another cold bomb had been
dropped in the narrows and any at-
tempt to destroy it would only result
in the death of those who made the
attempt

  faster faster  he pleaded to davis
if it gets far ahead of us well lose
it in the darkness

  davis pressed his lips together and
used every artifice he knew of to in-
crease the speed of his machine but
the glistening black body ahead of them
drew steadily farther away at last it
could barely be seen then as if in
derision a light appeared in the cabin
of the black fiver it winked oddly

dot-dash dot-dash-

  hes signaling said davis

 dot-dash dot-dash-

  w-a-t-c-h spelled davis t-h-e
m-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i-v-a-r-rh-u-s
watch the mississippi varrhus
repeated teddy hes getting away
hes getting away

  the light ahead of them winked and
disappeared the sky was empty ex-
cept for the biplane roaring after a
vanished enemy

  hes gotten away half sobbed
davis damn him  he killed curtiss
and hes gotten away

  teddy stared into the empty night
with something of davis disappoint-
ment and despair

chapter ix

 ext morning the world read at its
breakfast table that the missis-
sippi river had frozen over just below
st louis and that the water was ris-
ing rapidly the river had frozen sol-

idly up to the surface the level rose
and the water started to flow over the
top of the ice cake only to be turned
into ice as it did so hour by hour
the level rose and hour by hour the
solid ice barrier rose with the water
level men had tried to blast a way
through for the rushing waters but
without effect as fast as the water
tried to flow through the opening made
by a charge of dynamite it froze again
and plugged the hole through which it
was attempting to escape

  hastily improvised levees were
thrown up but the water outstripped
the efforts of the builders the lower
part of st louis was flooded and a
great part of the population made
homeless then low-lying lands beside
the river were gradually submerged
in twenty-four hours there were calls
for help all along the upper part of
the mississippi valley the rising
water had flooded immense areas of
cultivated land and even larger areas
were threatened in another day a
thousand square miles of crops were
under water and the loss in live stock
was assuming formidable proportions
the new cold bomb in new york har-
bor had crept up to the battery as
teddy had foreseen the norfolk cold
bomb had exploded fortunately with-
out loss of life gibraltar had wit-
nessed three almost simultaneous blasts
and was again free of ice but the whole
world knew that it was at the mercy
of varrhus

  davis evelyn and teddy were dis-
cussing the matter dolefully davis
had been coming to the laboratory daily
in the hopes of hearing that teddy had
devised some plan for the frustra-
tion of varrhus ambitious schemes
teddy found himself liking davis im-
mensely but with a peculiarly illogical
annoyance that evelyn seemed to like
him quite as well when he had
phoned her of his safety after the fight
with varrhus he could hear a flood
a thousand degrees below zero

i

of thankfulness in her voice but when
he saw her the next day she was al-
most distant he saw traces of real
anxiety on her face but she had not
been really natural until they had
worked nearly all day on the silver
bracelet trying to find what had been
done to the surface to give it its pecul-
iar property of allowing heat to pass
in one direction but not in the other
they were as far as ever from the solu-
tion davis was quite ignorant of ab-
stract chemistry or physics and could
not join in their discussions but teddy
fancied that he was much more inter-
ested in evelyn than was necessary
he was annoyed to find that he re-
sented it he had always looked on
evelyn as a comrade and he could not
understand this feeling that took pos-
session of him it did not occur to him
to speculate upon the fact that he found
ideas coming to him much more read-
ily when working by evelyns side or
that he rarely attempted anything with-
out asking her opinion teddy had
never thought much of romance and
he did not suspect how much evelyns
companionship meant to him

  davis was reiterating for the fortieth
time his disappointment at varrhus
getting away

  we almost had him he said dis-
gustedly our explosive bullets were
playing all over his infernal flying ma-
chine wed have landed one in that
little glass cabin of his nd smashed
him nicely in another minute when he
skipped off like that and ill swear
to it we were doing a hundred and
eighty miles an hour

  he ran away from us pretty easily
said teddy dismally isnt there a
faster machine than yours we could get
hold of

  nothing but a single-seater and not
so much faster at that said davis
a hundred and ninety-five is the best
even the latest single-seater combat
planes will do at a low altitude

  even for a short burst of speed
asked evelyn

  diving youll run up faster than
that davis explained when we
went straight down after varrhus we
must have gone over two hundred but
for straightaway work weve nothing
that will catch varrhus

  whats the official speed record
asked evelyn toying with a test tube
she looked singularly pretty in the long
white apron she wore in the laboratory

  two hundred and fifteen i think
said davis some spanish aviator
made it hed doped his gas with picric
acid though

  what does that do asked teddy
quickly

  its explosive and about doubles the
force of your explosions it eats your
engines right up though they used to
use it in motor-boat races until a rule
was made against it you see an en-
gine is ruined after twenty minutes or
so and it made the racing unfair for
people who couldnt buy a new engine
for every race

  teddys face grew thoughtful
picric acid he said meditatively
suppose we used it in the gas of your
plane would we have a chance of
catching varrhus

  i dont know davis said thought-
fully i hardly think so it would
make our speed better but if it were
anything of a chase our motors would
be ruined before wed gone far

  the acid attacks the steel of the
cylinders and makes the bore too
large teddy seemed to be thinking
rapidly

  yes you lose all your compres-
sion

  teddy looked at evelyn

  suppose the pistons and the inter-
iors of your cylinders were plated with
platinum  platinum is one of the hard
est metals and should stand up under
a great deal of wear
	a thousand degrees below zero

  would platinum resist the attack of
the acid  davis grew excited

  surely

  davis jumjed to his feet

  then weve got him new piston
rings will let you plate the cylinders
without reboring them unless youre
going to plate them heavily can you
do the plating

  try said teddy

  we make a hundred and eighty with
straight gasoline said davis excitedly

with doped gas- how long will

it take to fix my motors

  four or five hours well borrow
the acid vats of some electro plating
concern evelyn will mix the solu-
tion of platinum salts ill go arrange
to borrow the vats while you get your
motors disassembled and brought here
on a motor truck

  teddy hastily began to put on his
coat

  youre going to try to fight varrhus
again asked evelyn anxiously

  are we asked davis cheerfully
just ask me  we are

  you hit him several times in the
last fight said evelyn faintly and it
didnt do any good

  well use annor-pu-renig bullets this
time said davis exuberantly or we
may be able to mount a one-jxunder
automatic i think the plane will stand
it and at worst we can ram him

  evelyn turned a trifle pale that
means youll both be killed

  davis smiled maybe not well
take a chance anyway wont we ger-
rod

  teddy nodded shortly im going
to get varrhus or hes going to get me
he said succinctly

  they started for the front door
the commissioner of police was just
get ti ng out of his car

  news most likely said teddy and
they waited

  the commissioner of police looked



worried when he shook hands with
teddy

  my men have been trying to trace
that package that contained the brace-
let he told him and have found that
it was put in a country rural-deli very
mail box after dark the mail carrier
took it when he made his morning
route theres absolutely no way of
tracing it any farther any one might
have passed by in an automobile and
have put it in the farmer in whose
box it was is above suspicion now
another set of letters has been sent in
the same wav from another rural-de-
livery box a hundred miles from the
first one is addressed to miss haw-
kins i have it here the postal
authorities called me in when they saw
the envelope

  he showed a huge yellow envelope
addressed to evelyn in one corner
was a large return card the dicta-
torial residence

  it might be almost anything said
davis better not let miss hawkins
open it ill do it gerrod

  teddy shook his head

  well tell her about it and ill open
it in the laboratory

  evelyn and davis waited apprehen-
sively until teddy emerged from that
room

  no cold bombs no electric shocks
and no joison gas he said smiling
just a billet doux to evelyn it fits in
beautifully with our plans davis
evelyn took the sheet he extended
to her and read

the dictatorial residence august th

  his excellency wladislaw varrhus dicta-
tor of the earth has been much annpyed by
the efforts of one theodore gcrrod to ob-
struct his plans and desires he has been in-
formed through the press of the fact that
miss evelyn hawkins has collaborated with
and encouraged theodore gcrrod in his rash
attempts his excellency the dictator is
pleased to require that miss evelyn hawkins
repair to a spot some five miles due east from
nomans reef off the c at of maine miss
hawkins may bring with her a maid and
a thousand degrees below zero



such baggage as she may require she is to
be held as security for the cessation of theo-
dore cicrrods efforts to impede the secure
establishment of the dictatorship the mis-
sissippi hiver has been closed to traffic and
will remain closed until this order has been
obeyed by miss hawkins the time set for
m iss hawkins appearance at that spot is day-
break of tuesday september the third
given at the dictatorial residence

wlarisiaw varrhus

  evelyn looked at the three men with
a white face the commissioner of
police looked grave davis was smil-
ing and teddy was smiling too but
with a blaze of anger in his eyes

  gerrod said davis whimsically i
am much depressed that varrhus didnt
include me with you as making efforts
to obstruct his plans and desires

  the government will have to be no-
tified said the commissioner of police
solemnly

  do-do you think i had better go
asked evelyn hesitatingly

 no exploded teddy and davis
together teddy went on why
evelyn the man is insane and besides
weve just thought of something thats
sure to get him well lay in wait for
him and then hell walk into our parlor
nicely when he does-

  finis said davis cheerfully if
i may borrow a phrase from the
french

  and if its a long chase said teddy
even more cheerfully the dear person
set the time for dawn and well have
light to fight by lets go and set to
work on that plane of yours

  they left together in high spirits
evelyn stood quite still after they had
gone absently crushing the letter from
varrhus in her hand presently with
a sob she went to her room and al-
lowed herself to cry they would not
let her face danger but teddy was
going out to fight perhaps to die-and
for her

 over at the hangar mechanics
swarmed upon the fighting plane dis-

 btb

mounting the motors and disassembling
them the cylinders and pistons were
being carefully packed a big motor
truck had already backed up at the
wide door of the aeroplane shed and
as fast as the parts were packed they
were loaded on it davis was here
there and everywhere he had asked
permission for the experiment and it
has been granted the government
was prepared to risk almost anything
rather than allow varrhus to succeed
in his huge blackmailing of the entire
human race there was no hesitation
in allowing anything that might afford
a fighting chance of downing the black
flyer the mississippi floods were
growing in size and destructiveness
the new york cold bomb dropped the
night teddy and davis had fought the
black machine over the harbor was
expected to explode at any moment
every window still intact in the city
had been pasted with strips of paper
to keep the fragments from becoming
a menace to those on the streets when
the bomb should burst them

  davis had conferred with the-com-
mandant of the forts and volunteers
had been asked for among the garrison
a boat was being heavily armed with
concealed guns it would go to the
point where varrhus would expect
evelyn to be taken he would see
the small boat drop down to take
evelyn on board his evil craft and the
masked batteries of antiaircraft guns
would open on him in a blast of fire
teddys discovery that flares fired into
the cloud of liquified gas would cause
it to burn harmlessly in mid-air had
been adapted to protect the crew as
the guns opened on the hovering black
flyer a stream of fire balls would be
made to float overhead to set flaming
the stream of liquid hydrogen varrhus
might be expected to shoot downward
at that though the mission of the
boat crew was hazardous in the ex-
treme


a thousand degrees below zero

  the telephone rang in the hangar
teddy was on the wire he had com-
mandeered the big wooden acid vats of
an electro-plating plant and the plati-
num-plating solution was being mixed
even then if davis brought the mo-
tors over in parts the plating might
begin immediately

  the big truck rumbled off davis
smiling confidently on the seat beside
the chauffeur half a dozen mechanics
perched on various parts of the load
when the truck stopped before the
electro-plating plant they leaped off and
rushed the glistening cylinders inside
in twenty minutes they were in the plat-
ing solution and an almost infinitely
thin film of platinum was slowly form-
ing within them

  the workmen of the electro-plating
plant labored far into the night on their
task teddy had insisted that a film
of platinum ten times the thickness of
the usual precious-metal plating be used
and the process was slow when the
cylinders had been prepared the pis-
tons remained and the exhaust ports
and valves these too were coated
with the hard acid-resisting metal and
davis mechanics began their task of
fitting piston rings to the altered motor
parts the rings themselves had then
to be plated and all the plating bur-
nished and polished teddy and davis
snatched a few hours sleep while the
motor in its disassembled state was be-
ing carried back to the hangar and re-
installed in the aeroplane they woke
and during all the following day davis
sat in the pilots seat listening with a
practiced ear and aiding in the final
tuning up of the changed motors ad-
justing the carburetors to their new
fuel thirty per cent of picric acid
added to the finest highest grade gas-
oline was to be used no one had dared
use such a percentage before even for
motors that were expected to be ruined

  teddy in the meantime was famil-
iarizing himself with the small one-

pounder automatic gun-similar to the
german antitank weapons-that was
to be installed in the bow of the aero-
plane by nightfall all was finished
teddy ran over to new york and saw
evelyn for the last time before making
his attempt and the next morning he
and davis flew to xomans reef where
a camouflaged hangar had been erected
on telegraphed instructions from new
york tuesday dawn found them alert
and anxiously scanning the sky for a
sign of the black flyer

chapter x

the stars winked palely from the
graying sky in the east a pallid
whiteness showed which slowly yel-
lowed and then turned to pink the
dawn was breaking

 on the little reef men watched
keenly far out at sea its single funnel
tipped with red paint from the crimson
sunlight a little boat tossed and rolled
that boat contained the men who had
offered their lives for a chance to kill
this varrhus who threatened the lib-
erty of the world beside the camou-
flaged hangar two great horns seem-
ing to be enlarged megaphones pointed
toward the sky little wires ran from
their points to telephone receivers
strapped on the ears of intently listen-
ing men they were microphones to
detect the first sound of the musical
humming of the black flyer teddy
and davis were befurred and goggled
but had pushed up their goggles to take
powerful glasses and scan the sky
eagerly for a sight of their enemy
mechanics stood ready at the propellers
of the hidden fighting plane prepared
to spin the motors into roaring life the
instant the two aviators had settled in
their seats from before the wide
doors of the concealed hangar a broad
expanse of beach ran smoothly down
to the ocean the little boat tossed
and rolled the men at the micro-
a thousand degrees below zero



phones listened intently the others
searched the sky

  straight down from a wisp of golden
cloud a slim black speck fell toward
the earth at first so high was it
even those with field glasses could make
out only the thin shape of the glistening
black body it fell a thousand two

thousand feet- the whirring disks

above the slender body became risible
then the inclosed cabin near the center
the musical humming filled the air
lower and lower the strange machine
dropped davis and teddy were in
their seats

  now  said davis sharply and the
propellers whirled the motors caught
sputtered and began to run with a
steady droning roar davis watched
keenly as the black shape slowed in its
fall and came to a standstill above the
little tossing boat half a dozen men
were holding the aeroplane back and
the small shed was full of clouds of
choking dust and still more choking
fumes from the motor

  the black flyer hung motionless
barely three hundred yards above the
small boat there was a long moment
of waiting then the decks of the boat
seemed to fall in a dozen threatening
muzzles were exposed a dozen flashes
of flame shot up from the tiny vessel
simultaneously davis cried out the
men released his machine and it darted
forward he took off from the beach
skimmed the waves and shot out to-
ward the strange combat that was tak-
ing place

  the black flyer had been hit that
much was certain it lurched and stag-
gered in the air losing altitude all the
while then the pilot seemed to regain
control he swung swiftly to one side
and began to rise all the time the
anti-aircraft guns were firing viciously
the tossing boat made a poor platform
for the gunners however and their aim
was inevitably poor the guns kept up
a ceaseless roaring puff after puff

of white smoke showed where their
shells burst near varrhus he began
to swerve to zigzag using tactics
strangely like those of a dragon fly
suddenly he darted to a point exactly
above the small boat and a smoky cloud
began to dart down from below his
machine varrhus passed on but the
cloud fell swiftly precisely like the
cloud of liquified gas he had poured
down on teddy and davis above new
york harbor

  flares cried davis in an agony of
apprehension though his voice was only
audible to teddy by means of the tele-
phone connection between the two hel-
mets

  as he spoke the men on the boat shot
up the little fire balls that had pro-
tected the aeroplane in its former fight
a dozen balls of light sped up to meet
the menacing cloud of liquified gas
they reached it sped into it glowing
feebly  the white cloud did not ignite
but fell on toward the boat it reached
and enveloped the little vessel and sud-
denly the guns were still

  damn him  said teddy in a voice
that shook with rage hes not using
hydrogen we cant close in on him
now our flares are no good

  davis tilted the nose of his machine
upward and teddy stared down his
sights he pulled the trigger the
gun kicked backward but the recoil
cylinders did their work the tracer
shell left a little line of smoke behind
it it passed below the black body

  too low said teddy grimly and
fired again

  varrhus began to climb straight up
his machine went but with the picric
acid giving added impetus to the ex-
plosions in the cylinders the two-senter
climbed as rapidly varrhus ascent
swerved he was directly over the
aeroplane a whitish cloud appeared
below his machine and blotted it out
for an instant

  we zoom said davis almost gayfy
a thousand degrees below zero

and the fighting plane seemed to be
dancing on its tail for an instant the
cloud of gas unfolded itself down to
the surface of the water barely twenty
yards before the space in which davis
had checked his course

  around and around a huge circle
the biplane hod caught up with the
black flyer and davis turned toward
it for an instant to give teddy an op-
portunity to fire there was a flash
at the stern of the slender black bodv
and the symmetry of the glistening
form was marred by a ragged edge
where the tip of the tail had been blown
off

  almost said teddy griijily

  hell dive now

  davis was prepared for the maneu-
ver and almost as soon as the heli-
copter began to drop the biplane darted
down after it teddy firing viciously
the streaks of smoke that his shells
left behind them told him where he
missed varrhus shifted the course of
his fall and again a cloud drifted in
the air just before the pursuing plane
davis flung the jov-stick forward
and the fighter fell into an absolutely
vertical dive a second more and it
had turned upon its back and was fly-
ing upside down away from the threat-
ening mist

  davis twisted in mid-air and righted
his machine varrhus was darting
away barely two hundred feet above
the surface of the water again the
two-seater dived upon him teddys
shells were zipping dangerously near
the black machine it began to zigzag
to twist and turn like a snake it
doubled back and shot directly under
the biplane but too far below for the
deadly mist to be used davis banked
at a suicidal angle and went after it
again they passed directly above the
silent small boat drifting aimlessly on
the waves little icicles were forming
on the bulwarks showing that the cold
of the liquified gas was still intense

  for one instant teddy had a perfect
sight and pulled the trigger with the
peculiar confidence of a marksman who
knows he is making a perfect shot
there was a flash upon the upper por-
tion of the black hull a dark object
shot off at a tangent from one of the
whirring disks the helicopter sank
rapidly teddy gave a shout

  landed

  the black machine recovered again
one of the disks was badly injured
and now slowed and stopped showing
that the blade of one of the four sus-
taining propellers had been broken but
the remaining three increased their
speed varrhus seemed to abandon the
idea of fighting he began to shoot
away toward the northeast he was
more than a mile away and teddy had
stopped firing varrhus had had no
difficulty in distancing the same ma-
chine a week before and anticipated no
trouble in losing it even with his own
flyer partially crippled he had not
reckoned on the picric compound now
being used for fuel the biplane sped
madly after the fleeing black aircraft
the motors roared hugely and the wind
was like a solid mass pushing fiercely
against teddys exposed head a small
half-moon of glass protected davis
from the wind but for the gunner no
such protection was practicable the
rushing of the wind through the wires
and along the sides of the stream-line
body amounted to a shriek never had
such speed been known before

  davis voice came quietly to teddy
above the sounds outside muted by
the heavy padded helmet the tele-
phone receivers were fast against
teddys ears

  were making two hundred and
twenty-six

  were not gaining said teddy
grimly

  wait until he rises the motors
adjusted to be most efficient at about
seven thousand feet
a thousand degrees below zero



  the black speck ahead of them was
drawing no nearer it is true but it was
not dwindling the silvery wings of
the biplane cut through the air with
fierce impatience it flew in the
straightest of straight lines after the
other craft dark-brownish smoke
blew backward from the bellowing ex-
hausts tinged almost to saffron bv the
presence of the explosive acid the
sunlight kissed the upper surfaces of
the wings of the pursuing plane be-
low them the ocean rolled and tossed

  whistling wind and roaring engines
speed speed speed the biplane
rushed with incredible swiftness
through the air the black flyer
skimmed lightly on barely in advance
of its white-winged enemy twice
teddy essayed a shot but the biplane
trembled so that accuracy was impos-
sible and he could see by the smoke
of his tracer shell that he had gone
far wide of the black machine the
space between the black speck and the
waves below it seemed to increase

  rising said davis now well
get him

  teddy kept his eyes fixed on var-
rhus slender needlelike craft he was
barely conscious of the upward tilt of
the machine in which he was riding
but he saw that they were keeping pace
with varrhus as he rose in the air

  four thousand feet said davis
crisply and two hundred and
twenty-nine miles an hour theres
land ahead

  teddy saw a mountainous coast line
becoming visible far away the black
flyer continued to rise

  six thousand feet said davis
again and two hundred and thirty-
two miles-

  the pilot of the other machine saw
that they were gaining he dropped
abruptly

  now w exclaimed davis fiercely

  he dived downward the descent
coupled with the immense power of

the engines-now delivering vastly
more than the eight hundred horse
power for which they were designed-
made them shoot toward the black
flyer with increasing speed the other
machine was barely more than half a
mile away and every detail of its con-
struction was visible teddy noticed
for the first time a slender tube rising
between the two center sustaining pro-
pellers he instantly leaped to the con-
clusion that it was the means by which
the jets of liquified gas had been shot
out he fired

  a hit cried davis

  there had been a flash from the top
of the cabin a jagged rent appeared
in the polished roofing and the slender
tube vanished the black flyer seemed
to abandon all hopes of escape it sped
madly for a gap between two of the
tall mountains that rose along the coast
line at the unprecedented speed with
which both machines had been traveling
the coast seemed fairly to rush at them
no villages were visible but it seemed
to be a habitable if not an inhabited
land the black flyer swept on across
country varrhus evidently making
every effort to gain even a few yards
on his adversaries and davis just as
fiercely determined that he should not
once twice three times teddy fired

  a smoothed and inclosed field al-
most surrounded with small buildings
appeared varrhus dashed toward it
desperately the white-winged biplane
vengefully after him the black flyer
dropped like a stone and the biplane
dived straight for it in that last dive
teddy worked his one-pounder as
coolly as if at target practice flash
flash the black flyer crumpled and
fell the last fifty feet as an inert mass

  teddy jumped from the biplane as
it flattened out and settled to the
ground with his automatic pistol
drawn and ready he darted toward the
partly wrecked black machine as he
drew near a sallow face came weakly
a thousand degrees below zero

to a window of the cabin an auto-
matic flashed from beside the face and
teddy heard a queer sound and a fall
behind him he did not stop but
rushed on shooting- viciously at the face
in the opening he reached the wreck
wrenched open the door and swung
into the cabin with utter disregard for
danger

  a tall lean sallow man was sitting
exhausted in the pilots seat of the black
flyer his right arm was crimsoned
from a wound in his shoulder and
blood spurted in little frothy jets from
a second wound in his neck teddys
fire had been better directed than he
knew as he entered with pistol ready
the sallow man raised his head erect
by a tremendous effort a hooked
nose a merciless mouth and blazing
eyes filled teddy with repulsion the
sallow man stared at him superciliously

  i am wladislaw varrhus dictator
of all the earth he said in a metallic
voice i command-i-command

  speech failed him his head dropped
and he fell limply from the cushioned
seat

chapter xi

teddy felt the fallen mans breast
but he was not breathing in any
event there was nothing that could have
been done for him an artery had been
cut by a splinter of the one-pounder
shell that had smashed the roof and
he had bled quietly to death only try-
ing desperately to land and get assist-
ance before he died the sight of
teddy and davis sprinting toward him
with drawn pistols had been too much
for his hatred however and he had
fired his automatic at them even as he
was dying teddy found davis lying
on the ground with a bullet in his hip

  im all right gerrod said davis
cheerfully when teddy went to him
just see if there are any more chaps
in these houses before you bother with
me

  teddy explored the place thoroughly
there were many signs of human oc-
cupancy but no one save varrhus him-
self had been there when they landed
he returned to davis to find him
weakly trying to improvise a pad to
stop the bleeding teddy lifted him
and carried him to the house that
seemed to be most used in a little
while davis was quite comfortable and
contented he lit a cigarette and
calmly began to read one of the news-
papers that littered the place while
teddy continued his explorations

  the landing field was a small one
no more than a hundred and fifty yards
long by seventy-five wide at one end
was an unpretentious but comfortable
dwelling in one of whose rooms davis
was at that moment resting at the
other end a shed evidently formed the
hangar for the black flyer along the
sides of the inclosure were long sheds
some of them empty some containing
supplies of various sorts half a
dozen cold bombs complete except for
the mysterious treatment of their sur-
face that gave them their strange prop-
erty lay on the floor of one of the
sheds along the sides another shed
long disused had provided quarters for
workmen teddy found the single exit
that led from the inclosure it opened
on the wide hillside and afforded a view
of miles without a sign of human habi-
tation the remnant of a wheel track
that had obviously not been traveled
for months led away from the door
along that primitive road the materials
for building the inclosure and the black
-flyer had evidently been brought
teddy went back to davis

  gerrod said davis amiably im
a fake id lost quite some blood you
know and i was pretty weak but while
you were gone i saw a small black
bottle on a shelf over there and i
managed to crawl over to it wherever
we are prohibition hasnt struck in and
i took just enough to feel all right
a thousand degrees below zero



again i believe i can drive bacic it
wasnt more than a two-hour drive any-
way was it

 between two and three said
teddy smiling we were making ter-
rific speed though were probably in
newfoundland somewhere

  or iceland to tell the truth im
quite indifferent suppose you help me
out to the machine again

  i want to see what i can find in
the laboratory first said teddy

  the laboratory was of the smallest
whatever experiments had been neces-
sary to perfect the cold bombs and the
black flyer had been made elsewhere
teddy found a number of notebooks
which he took he found many chem-
icals some in considerable quantities
in receptacles about the laboratory but
no clew to the mysterious process that
had enabled varrhus to threaten the
worlds security he left varrhus
where he lay both he and davis con-
fidently expected to return and inves-
tigate thoroughly both the cold bombs
and the black flyer davis especially
was anxious to examine that strange
machine in detail but his wound was
painful and he wished to have it prop-
erly dressed besides this the whole
world was waiting anxiously to learn
its fate whether varrhus ambitious
plans were to be frustrated or whether
it would have to put its neck beneath
the heel of the mad dictator

  teddy lifted davis in the machine
and after some difficulty they started
off davis circled above the small
clearing until it was tiny beneath them

  course is southwest he remarked
to teddy well notice where we land
and then a northeast course will bring
us back here again or nearly

  right said teddy abstractedly
his mind leaped ahead to the moment
when he would see evelyn again he
had seen her just before starting for
nomans reef and she had seemed pale
and anxious he was not sure but

he hoped he was right in believing that
she was more anxious than she would
have been had she looked on him merely
as a friend or comrade

  the biplane sped over the sea across
which it had flown in such desperate
haste that morning davis was weak
but for straightaway flying modern ma-
chines need but little attention the
new inherently stable aeroplanes are so
safe that an amateur could pilot one in
midflight and davis had taken a small
quantity of stimulant to supplement his
strength at that however his endur-
ance was severely taxed before he flat-
tened out and taxied across the landing
field on staten island mechanics
rushed out to greet him and help him
from the machine

  varrhus is dead and the black flyer
is smashed said davis cheerfully and
incontinently fainted

  teddy made a hasty report to the
commandant of the forts and rushed to
new york the second cold bomb had
exploded that morning and the city was
panic-stricken but as his taxicab sped
uptown the extras began to appear an-
nouncing the removal of the menace to
the world the frightened crowds
changed to happy cheering ones if
teddys identity had been suspected as
he passed swiftly through the streets
he would never have gotten through
he would have been dragged from the
motor car to be cheered and recheered
as it was he made his way quickly to
evelyns home

  he sprang up the steps and burst
open the door not waiting for the serv-
ant to open it as he rushed into the
hall evelyn came into it through an
open door she saw him and her face
was suffused with joy

  youre safe she cried joyfully
and burst into happy tears

  teddy took her quite naturally into
his arms and held her there a moment
she sobbed quietly on his shoulder for
a second clinging to him then pushed


a thousand degrees below zero

him away and stared at him while a
hot flush overspread her face

  oh she exclaimed in a rush of

shame i-i- she turned and

ran away teddy caught her

  whats the matter he demanded
her cheeks were still crimson

  i-i kissed you she said desper-
ately and you-you hadnt said-

  teddy laughed happily i hadnt
said i loved you well if thats all
thats bothering you just listen and
teddy said it several times

  davis was up and about in less than
a week his wound had been of little
importance and with a crutch which
he took pride in using with dexterity
he was able to move around almost as
well as ever tie came over to tea with
evelyn one afternoon teddy was
there too of course davis was boy-
ishly showing off how well he could
move about teddy watched him crit-
ically

  thats all right davis he said in
a paternal tone but you want to get
rid of that instrument as soon as you
can

  what for demanded davis deftly
swinging himself into a chair

  were waiting for you to get well
explained teddy with a smile at eve-
lyn it isnt considered good form
to have a groomsman whos a cripple

 groomsman  who what you
two davis stared from one to the
other

  teddy nodded and evelyn turned
slightly pink davis turned to teddy

  they tell me you and i are to be
impressively decorated for smashing
varrhus he complained and therell
be moving pictures taken of it and
shown everywhere i want to be a
touching picture all wounded up you
know when that happens a girl threw
me over about six months ago and she
likes the movies when she sees me
beautifully mangled and being kissed
by bearded people who pin medals on
me shell be sorry maynt i wear a
crutch until then

  teddy laughed and evelyn smiled
affectionately at davis

  if its like that of course said
evelyn well wait but teddys in
an awful hurry

  i would be too in his place said
davis promptly he assumed an ex-
pression of extreme reluctance well
i suppose ill have to get well

  teddy shamelessly squeezed evelyns
hand and she as shamelessly squeezed
back

there are compensations for hav-
ing to wait said teddy generously
provided of course it isnt too long
davis looked at them and his eyes
twinkled

  well then in that case- he

started for the rear of the house
  where are you going

  davis looked over his shoulder with
a grin

  you people compensate each other
for waiting he said amiably im
going to go out in the laboratory and
kiss the galvanometer

why is it

isnt it a funny thing that if a woman is clever enough to be able to dye her
hair a beautiful color that almost defies detection people are quite ill-natured
and unkind about it whereas if nature has saved her the trouble and given
her lovely locks everybody praises them as though the credit belonged to the
owner personally
    note-the sargasso sea with which this story deals is a vast mass of floating debris
-wreckage et cetera from all parts of the world it is said to be as large as two hundred
square miles in extent and it is sometimes callcd the rubbish heap of the atlantic
through some unknown agency of tide or current rubbish drifts here from all parts and
if a ship gets caught in the floating seaweed which has grown amid the wreckage it has a
very hard task in extricating itself-as christopher columbus found it is not too far-
fetched a theory that the center of this vast floating continent may have attained a measure

of solidity in the course of the centuries
               chapter i

the story begun by john cle-
 cijurch in st johns newfound-
 land

i am not to meet mr boone first
not until you reach his house
in newfoundland said my friend
gervase slowly he is probably the
greatest traveler in the world but he
never comes here to montreal

i may consider myself as engaged
entirely so he left the matter to
my discretion my friend spoke ab-
sent-mindedly his eyes fixed on the

midday bustle of st james street be-
low us he turned suddenly and leaned
forward across his desk you are go-
ing to him as private secretary but you
may become very much more when
you have his confidence he will perhaps
tell you an almost incredible story i
want to assure you in advance that he
is the most level-headed man of all my
friends and the least given to exaggera-
tion

  i thought of that warning many times
during my journey from montreal to
newfoundland and when i arrived at
the little capital of the ancient colony


the lost empire

i had stirred up quite a curiosity about
it indeed i built up an elaborate
romance concerning my new employer
although it fell far short of the reality
the first stage began about five min-
utes after i arrived in newfoundland
the station agent at the reid depot in
st johns asked me if i were mr
colechurch and then told me mr
boone had sent a car for me

  he hasnt come himself he said
  i didnt expect him

  same thing if you did he hasnt
been inside a railway station for years
travels by road

  if he does no one ever sees him
pyaps he flies out of the window on
a broomstick

  i shrugged my shoulders and passed
out to the car boone park was situ-
ated on the coast about halfway be-
tween st johns and placentia bay
but we made excellent time i dont
know whether it was the warning of
my friend gervase or the strange re-
mark of the station agent but i spent
the whole journey in speculations as
to the nature of the mystery i was to
find at my destination

  i was still thinking about it when i
was ushered into the library at boone
park mr boone had left word that
he would be engaged for a little time
but he wished me to make myself at
home until he arrived the english
butler-what an export trade in but-
lers the english have-supplied me
with an excellent cigar and waved his
hand majestically toward an easy-chair

  i think ill have a look at the books
i said and i made my way to the near-
est shelves

  he condescended to smile affably

 you re right among em he chuckled
they seem to be all books of ex-
ploration i said doubtfully

   underds of em he buys every
book that comes out dealing with out-
landish parts of the world and he has
half a dozen fellers searchin the big

libraries at montreal and new york
and london somethin about a lost
continent its nearly as big as can-
ada i guess and the trees are all cov-
ered with seaweed and theres no wind
ever blows there-

  lie stiffened suddenly into the rigid-
ity of the well-trained servant as foot-
steps came hurriedly along the hall
mr boone entered with a kind of quiet
haste which i afterward found was
his habitual manner behind his cour-
tesy i felt an extraordinary anxiety in
his greeting of me his eyes were
large and luminous and i had a curious
fancy that somewhere at the back of
them was a thought that was with him
day and night but to which he dared
not give expression he struck me as
a man who was starving for sympathy

  that was the dominant impression i
had and events proved my surmise was
about right i only know that as soon
as i looked at him i felt an overpower-
ing sympathy and liking for him mys-
tery or no mystery i was godfrey
boones man from that moment and i
loved him as rare ben jonson said he
loved shakespeare

  youve been having a look at the
books he said what do you think
of this lot 

  i crossed the room to the shelf he
indicated expecting to find more books
on exploration to which as a matter
of fact i am not particularly partial
instead of that he led me to the most
wonderful collection of shakespeareana
i ever saw in my life that is not per-
haps the right term they were not
so much books dealing with shake-
speare as with the times in which he
lived

  i may say at once that shakespearean
england-aye and jacobean america
if you will-is the literary passion of
my life my hand trembled as i
reached out to a quaint little volume
entitled essaies on ye newe re-
ligion by john powell gentleman
the lost empire



published in  at the sign of the
green dragon in fleete street lon-
don

  this book is registered as having
completely disappeared i cricd ex-
citedly i was reading in montreal
only last week that there was not a
known copy in any library in the
world

  i turned round as i spoke mr
boones face was as white as a sheet
he pointed unsteadily to the book

  there is one copy left at any rate
i had it from a direct descendant of
the author tell me this he added
is it possible for a man to dream so
vividly that he believes his dreams to
have been actual happenings

  i could not see what his question had
to do with the little volume i held i
dont know i said vaguely he
might be confused when he first wak-
ened but later i dont see how there
could be any uncertainty

  supposing i visited a continent half
as big as the united states or canada
with physical peculiarities that differ-
entiated it from any country known to
geography-but they cant find it-

  i should put it down as a dream
i said gently

  but if i returned from my dream
with something tangible he cried
with a sudden wildness in his voice
and he thrust a trembling forefinger
at the book you tell me that is quite
unknown to collectors he said sol-
emnly and i tell you on my word
of honor that i came back to con-
sciousness writh that book in my
pocket

  there flashed across my mind a most
extraordinary circumstance the es-
saies on ye newe religion had been
ordered to destruction by king james
in  and every copy had been ac-
counted for writh one exception that
was the copy belonging to the author
john powell and it disappeared with
him and about half of the inhabitants

of the village where he lived in a man-
ner that had never been explained

  i said nothing of this to mr boone
just then it did not throw any light
on the problem of the lost continent
personally i felt convinced his visit
there had been part of an unusually
vivid dream and then i came up
against the question of the book which
i could not explain at all and there
was another point to assume that
he was on the borderland of conscious-
ness when he visited the lost continent
was to suggest in view of his extraor-
dinary attitude ever since that he was
now on the borderland of insanity
bear in mind that i loved this man
from the first moment i saw him and
you will appreciate how much it hurt
me to doubt his story

  you cant believe it he said sadly
it was then that a happy inspiration
came to me i want to remember the
last words gervase said to me at mon-
treal i said he told me that sooner
or later you would probably tell me
an almost incredible story and he
begged me to accept his opinion that
you were one of the most level-headed
men he knew and the least given to
exaggeration

  he nodded with a pleasant cheerful-
ness yes i will tell you some day
but not just yet

  and i for my part mr boone will
wait until you choose to tell me the
whole story until then sir i pledge
all my energies to the search

  thats a bargain and now well
forget that part of the subject by
the bye ill just show you what i want
you to do

  the men who were conducting the
search at the worlds big libraries re-
ported every week and it was to be part
of my duties to keep an exhaustive
cross-index of the points they reported
the continent is probably two mil-
lion square miles in extent he said
that includes a vast outer belt of


the lost empire

what they call the swamp lands they
extend for hundreds of miles all around
the continent

  go ahead he added with a faint
smile i can see you are up against
a difficulty already if we are to do
any good we must fare any question
in fact you might ask a question that
could put me on the track of the whole
mystery

  i was only thinking how extraordi-
nary it is that such an immense area
could have been overlooked by the geo-
graphical writers and explorers

  that will be cleared up some time
have you never worked out an appar-
ently insoluble problem and then found
the end of it was something known to
every schoolboy - something you missed
because every time you approached it
you ignored it thinking it had nothing
to do with your problem 

  that indeed was what we were all
doing although we could not realize it
at the time

  neglect no clew however insigniti
cant it may seem

ill do my very best mr boone
i know you will now just let
me give you some more details about
the peculiarities of this lost continent
of mine

  i nodded eagerly

  well it has been occupied for sev-
eral centuries and it contains alout half
a million people today that is only
a guess-so it may be considered fairly
secure and yet every inch of that
vast area- two million square miles-
quivers underfoot like a stupendous
raft even the houses rise and fall as
though the eat ill beneath them were
breathing  ht is the bem comparison

i can think of you follow me

  i nodded again-perhaps a little less
eagerly this time

  i want you to approach the prob-
lem independently because personally
i am obsessed w ith an idea that the con-
tinent is somewhere near to or in amer-

ica-somewhere between here and cape
horn

  there are vast tracts of brazil un-
explored but the whole area of that
country is only three million miles

  it isnt there he said positively
its north of brazil i am convinced
its somewhere near the coast of the
 fitted states which on the face of it
is frankly impossible i cant give vou
my reasons until i tell you the whole
story

  i suppose the people who live there
are savages mr boone

scarcely whv do you think that
well if they were civilized they
would surelv have some notion of their
own whereabouts didnt they say any-
thing

  i dont think they knew where they
were their forefathers were wrecked
there three hundred years ago and they
have been out of touch with the rest
of the world ever since anything
else 

 you sav they are not savages
what race do they belong to i won-
dered if they are the survivals of a
racial type otherwise extinct

  they are english speaking lie said
quietly and in a way they are ameri-
cans but thev neither speak nor dress
like either of those races t he nearest
comparison i can think of is the pil-
grim bathers who settled massachu-
setts three centuries ago they speak
and dress exactly like those early
amonoans

  that left me absolutely speechless
i could only stare at him the idea
of a vast continent half as large as
the united states or canada or europe
occupied by half a million people de
scended from some contemporaries of
the pilgrim fathers and still retaining
the seventeenth century dress and
manner of speech it was incredible
that such a land and such a people
could have been in existence for three
hundred years unknown to the rest of
the lost empire



the world as for the everlasting trem-
bling of this vast area and the fact
mentioned by the butler that its trees
were covered to the very summits with
seaweed- well i was already stupefied
with amazement and a few marvels
more or less made little difference

  hut there was still one more shock
to come to me i had been staring to-
ward the door and i am certain my
eyes had not wandered from that point
be fore the lnitlcr presently entered

  all alone mr  olechurch he said

  i turned expecting to find mr boone
by my side but he had absolutely dis-
appeared i am positively certain he
had not gone through the doorway and
the window was at least thirty feet
from the ground

  yes i said lamely mr boone has
just gone out

  and you dont know how he went
said johnson knowingly youll get
used to that now you wont see any-
thin of him for two or three weeks
youll have time to toot round new-
foundland a bit and a mighty pretty
country youll find it

chapter ii

thl story con tin ili by john colk-

cnrrcn in nkwfovndland

johnson took mr boones disap-
pearance so coolly that he infected
me with his own matter-of-fact spirit
they surely knew him better than i
did even though i might possibly know-
more than they did of the tragedy that
was wrecking his life

  during the next three weeks i did
a great deal of hard thinking about the
lost continent kither he went away to
follow up some clew personally-al-
though that did not explain the manner
of his disappearance--or else his going
was caused by a feeling that he must
retire for a time to recover his self
control the latter explanation raised
another point he was in the habit

of making these mysterious disappear-
ances regularly how long would it
be before the constant strain would
master him and the relief of solitude
would fail to act and what then

 that was the point to which my
thoughts always brought me arguing
in a circle from which i found no es-
cape t sat for hours brooding over
the problem i read the reports of the
agents who were searching the libraries
at new york and montreal and lon-
don- aye and at paris and buenos
aires and cape town and a score of
other cities-but i found no solution

  one man wrote of the vast unex-
plored areas in northwestern canada
another of the hiatus between civilized
quebec and labrador a third of great
areas in the united states a fourth
of the untrodden lands in south amer-
ica a fifth wrrote of the silent wastes
of siberia and so on all over the world
i had no idea there was such a large
part of the earths surface still un-
mapped

  but all their discoveries came to noth-
ing they could find no place in the
world that corresponded with the de-
scription given by mr boone the
vast extent of the lost continent the
strange undulations of its surface the
monstrous growths of seaweed-bear-
ing bright-red berries-the thing was
incredible

  there was only one conclusion to be
drawn and the logic of it drove me to
despair for i loved this godfrey
boone and the wreckage of his life and
his hopes would affect me deeply his
eyes haunted me by day and night
their wistful appeal was with me wher-
ever i went i tramped through the
great spruce forests of this beautiful
newfoundland where the scent of the
spruce clings to your lips and the turf
springs so lightly beneath your feet
where the hills climb up into the sky
and the valleys are lakes of sunshine
and all the beauty that was around me


the lost empire

was as nothing i could think only of
godfrey boone and his trouble

 i took to wandering about the
grounds of boone park at night and
it was then that i made another dis-
covery although it was not of much
value just then i have said that
shakespearean england was the pas-
sion of my hfe ever since i was a
boy i had spent my happiest moments
with hakluyt and drake and raleigh
and rare ben jonson and all the rest
of that joyous crowd and one night
as i lifted up my eyes to stare at the
turreted towers of boone it came to
me that here was the picture of all
my dreams standing before rtie in the
moonlight it was the very ideal of
a sixteenth or early seventeenth-century
mansion just such a house as some
of the leaders among the pilgrim
fathers might have left i felt sud-
denly as though a great light flashed
ah about me surely it was from such
a place as this that the first people of
mr boones lost continent must have
gone or at any rate their leaders

  there was something in the argu-
ment that eluded me perhaps i was
too tired to follow it up properly i
only know that i remained staring va-
cantly at the great pile of granite with
its battlemented towers and the smooth
gteen lawns all around and that i grad-
ually became aware of a furious whir-
ring noise far overhead it seemed to
be coming nearer and nearer until it
seemed like the droning of a million
bees at once

  i was standing near a little clump of
spruce when i first heard it and i
thought it came from the xtber side i
ran swiftly round with the humming
and the droning beating into my ears
all the time i turned the corner and
instantly there was silence nothing but
the vague rustlings of the night and
ihe wind creeping among the trees i
did not go to bed at all that night but
wcfft to the library and sat there in-

tending to wait for daylight i am
afraid i was very tired and i must
have fallen asleep and dropped my pipe
on the floor

  the sudden closing of a door wak-
ened me with a start and i sat upright
there was only one door to the library
that i knew of and i naturally looked
toward that at the same moment i
heard footsteps at the other side of
the room and mr boone passed me
without seeing me and stood by the
window staring with wide eyes at the
brightness o the morning

  my first consciousness was that i
must have slept for several hours and
almost immediately after that i felt a
great upwelling of sympathy and affec-
tion for the lonely watcher by the win-
dow he turned presently and saw
me and i suppose he saw also the
pleasure on my face

  youre glad to see me he said
wistfully and then he pointed to my
unlucky pipe that lay all spilled on the
beautiful persian rug burning a hole
into the costly fabric

  i was really distressed because i have
a keen appreciation of beautiful things
and the rug was certainly an exquisite
example of its kind im afraid i
fell asleep i stammered

  youve been wandering about the
grounds instead of going to bed

  i was worried about something mr
boone

  and even when you were dead tired
you didnt go to your bed but turned
in here to finish your gloomy reverie
oh john colechurch he said sud-
denly with intense feeling vibrating in
his voice i ought to have that hole
outlined in thread of gold do you
think i dont know why you couldnt
sleep the day is coming when you
will ask me for my story

  i wish you would take me with you
when you go on these journeys mr
boone even without understanding i
might be able to help you
the lost empire



  but he shook his head it must
be all or nothing he said his eyes
shining some day you will be ready
very soon now i think but not yet
cant i do anything in the mean-
time 

  try to believe in me he said pas-
sionately try to believe that i am
a perfectly normal man who has had
an experience which no other man in
the world has had at any rate no
other man has lived to tel it i left
my life and happiness behind me on
that lost continent and i have lost the
clew that would take me back do
you wonder i cant be like other peo-
ple

  his very soul was staring out of
those deep-set eyes as he spoke he
was moved to the depths of his being
and i was scarcely less so suddenly
he broke into an unsteady laugh

  go along to your tub and waken
yourself up for the day he said
dont forget that a chap who hasnt
been to sleep needs a lot more waking
than one who has

  he maintained the same lively hu-
mor throughout breakfast alternating
however with fits of the most intense
thoughtfulness he roused himself
from one of the latter to ask me to
write during the day to a theatrical
costumer in montreal instructing him
to send to st johns two suits to be
made in the early seventeenth-century
style with doublets and hose and copa-
tain hats and a rapier with each suit
i was also to tell him where he could
get our measurements in montreal

  do you know how to use a sword
he asked as we were crossing the hall
after breakfast

  not very much mr boone

  well take up fencing and quarter-
staff will you write to monsieur
decrime of new york-somewhere in
fifth avenue-and ask him to come
here for a month or two-long enough
to make us skillful in the rapier

  i have a reason for these plans
he added slowly but i dont want to
mention it yet if events shape as i
hope and expect they will you will
thank me for the preparations i am
making now

  he never spoke a truer word than
that for the swordsmanship i learned
from monsieur decrime saved my life
a little later when wc were on the lost
continent in the meantime i was more
puzzled than ever my problem was
now something like this

  a lost continent half as large as canada
or the united states not part of the solid
earth but a kind of vast floating island
where the ground rocked and trembled con-
tinual where the trees were covered with
seaweed creeper and where the wind never
blew the periodical disappearances of mr
boone from some concealed door in the h
brary and his return in an aeroplane to a
secret hangar his provision of early sa-
enteenth-century suits for both of us with
lessons in the use of the rapier last but
not least the alleged fact that the lost con-
tinent was occupied by half a million people
directly descended from contemporaries of
the pilgrim fathers and still speaking and
dressing like those founders of massa-
chusetts

  that was one side of the account
on the other all we had was the little
volume of essaies originally belong-
ing or apparently belonging to a sev-
enteenth-century englishman who dis-
appeared about the time the pilgrim
fathers left the old country surely
it was the most extraordinary problem
ever placed before a human being

  we sat together in the library that
morning i had been recapitulating
these arguments pro and con for the
thousandth time while he sat drumming
his fingers on the table

  we are nearly at the end of our
search he said suddenly my agents
say they have exhausted every possi-
bility i cant hold out much longer
the suspense is killing me

  gervase arrived on a visit a few days
later and cheered up the flagging hopes


the lost empire

of my employer wonderfully mr
boone looked at me a little doubtfully
when the visitor was announced and
then he broke into a bright smile

  i see the machiavellian hand of
john colechurch in your coming he
said this pestilent fellow you sent
me is secretary and doctor and nurse
and night watchman and i dont know
what else if you had searched from
labrador to cape horn you could not
have found a better man

  gervase gave a grunt of satisfaction
hows the great affair going on he
said cheerfully i suppose one of
these days when you have the solution
to your problem youll be wondering
how you managed to miss it so long
we may find it too late

  johnson came in at that moment for
some instructions and mr boone left
the room with him

  how is he going on  said gervase
swiftly hes thinner i dont like
that strained look in his eyes

  hes got to find this lost continent
soon or die of a broken heart the
suspense is mastering him he cant
stand it much longer

  he must hes got to and youve
got to hold him up there are only
two ends to this business success or
disaster if his story is correct and
honestly id sooner believe him than
any other man i know two million
square miles of land cannot remain per-
manently hidden from all mankind

  i shook my head gloomily the
men who are making the search for
him are limited to the known facts of
geography

  well 

  what about the vast areas of the
earths surface that have never been
explored at all 

  have vou noticed that large wall
map in his dressing room the one
with certain areas shaded in red

  i had studied it many a time and
wondered about it also

  the portions shaded in red are the
explored areas covered by his agents
at the big libraries

  and the others  i said eagerly
boone has explored them all tell
me he said suddenly how are you
getting on here

  i like him immensely

  but you dont believe in his lost
continent 

  i believe in him

  so do i he said earnestly not
only that i believe his story i be-
lieve he had some extraordinary ex-
perience and then lost all clew to it
why is he so anxious to get back
gervase shrugged his shoulders
cherchez la femme he said enigmati-
cally i think he left his heart with
one of the little pilgrim fathers
mind ive never heard the full story
nor had i it came to-me suddenly
that i was striving heart and soul to
help godfrey boone and i did not even
know his story i went to him that
night and i asked him to tell me all

  are you ready he said wistfully
we stood there looking at each other
for a moment and then without an-
other word he crossed the room to his
desk and took out a roll of paper then
he turned away speaking to me with
averted face

  that is the story he said with a
kind of passion in his voice i admit
it is almost incredible judged by ordi-
nary standards but i swear most sol-
emnly that it does not contain a single
false or exaggerated word

chapter iii

tjie story continued by godfrey
boone

y ancestors came from england to
america nearly three centuries
ago and later they went to canada
my father came to newfoundland
thirty or forty years ago when he in-
herited a considerable fortune when
the lost empire



he came here he gratified a lifelong
desire by building this exact model of
a jacobean manor house so exactly
did he reproduce the old home of our
people that he even constructed a secret
door in the library leading by an un-
derground staircase to a clearing and
so out to the road

  this clearing was several acres in
extent and it was surrounded by a
dense forest practically impassable to
those who did not know of the hidden
path to the placentia road he told
me of this only a few years ago and
it appealed to me at once as an admira-
ble site for a hangar unattended by any
of the publicity which i loathed it
is in fact nearly five years since i
installed my plane there and to this
day i doubt if any one knows of its
existence because i have always left
and returned in the dead of the night

  my enthusiasm enabled me to add
several important improvements to the
machine i equipped it with a stabi-
lizer of my own invention and also
with a storage tank which made it
possible for me to undertake the most
extended journeys and to bid defiance
to all kinds of weather while every-
body was shrugging their shoulders at
the suggested flight across the atlantic
i had already driven my plane over
that ocean a score of times i have
flown from boone park to asia with-
out a stop and have even traversed the
terrible ice fields of the frozen north
sooner or later i will give my inven-
tions to the world but i have not had
the heart to do so yet

  i became so careless of time and
distance that i often rose from my hid-
den hangar and swept right ahead with-
out troubling to consider my direction
on the night that the great adventure
came to me i have a more or less con-
fused impression that i was heading
across the atlantic but that is merely
an impression i was extraordinarily
sleepy that night and i think i must

 btb

have dozed with my hands on the con-
trols

  how long i slept i do not know to
this day when i wakened it was
broad daylight and there was land right
beneath me stretching in every direct
tion here again my impression is that
i was somewhere over the american
continent i looked round for a good
place to land and this soon presented
itself in the midst of a vast forest i
took a chance as they say and vol-
planed right into the clearing i sighted

  it did not take me long to release
myself from my plane and spring to
the ground but i was back immediately
for the heavy turf stirred beneath my
feet i climbed across the plane and
alighted at the other side and here
again the turf quivered for all the
world as though i were on a floating
island

  the sight of the massive trees all
around reassured me to some extent
and i struck out boldly while the earth
rocked under my feet as though it wa
subject to the groundswell of some dis-
tant storm at sea during the next
few months i traversed many miles of
this strange country and everywhere
i went there was the same stealthy
quivering

  i forgot all this for a time when i
noticed the intense stillness all the
time i was there i never knew the wind
to blow and the silence was so intense
that when a bird presently flew over
my head the beating of its wings was
like the whirring of my propeller

  for some reason i do not yet under-
stand the wind blows all round tbifi
continent but never across it it may
be that the gigantic belt of swamp lands
that encircle it acts in some way as a
barrier to hold out the wind that is
only a suggestion because i cannot
offer any real explanation

  but even that was not all something
in the appearance of the trees attracted
my attention and i saw to my amax


the lost empire

ment that they were almost covered
with some kind of monstrous seaweed
with innumerable littje scarlet berries
and long yellow leaves it was a veri-
table forest of seaweed if you can im-
agine such a place

  my next realization was a more prac-
tical one it must have rained heavily
during the night as i slept for my
clothes were wet through and it was
important that i should have a change
quickly i rarely wore my leather fly-
ing suit in the summer and i had had
no protection from the storm

  i struck into the forest hoping to
find a cottage of some kind the path
was broad but very gloomy and i sup
pose i must have tramped several miles
before i began to see great shafts of
sunlight beating through the overhang-
ing seaweed and presently i came to
a little cottage it stood on the out-
skirts of the forest and appeared to be
unoccupied

  the morning air was chilly and i
did not feel in the mood to wait long
after a few vain attempts to attract
attention i put my shoulder against
the door and burst its flimsy fastening
there were but two rooms both of
them practically empty i was just
about to turn away when my eye was
caught by a glint of color from some
bundles of clothing lying in the corner

  i learned afterward that the cottage
was the haunt of a gang of thieves
lut i did not stay to think that out
just then the contents of the bundles
absorbed all my possibilities of aston-
ishment there were suits of every
size and shape and color but they were
all of antique cut something like the
dothes worn by our forefathers of the
early seventeenth century there were
doublets and hose side-slops hats
with huge brims and others with high
crowns there were boots and shoes
of every color and stacked up in a
corner there was a goodly collection of
swords and daggers

  anything was better than the clothes
i was wearing i thought i had gotten
to the headquarters of some society of
cranks with a predilection for the days
of the pilgrim fathers but i was too
eager for dry clothes to bother much
about theories in about ten minutes
i had changed into a handsome blue
suit with a copatain hat a pair of span-
ish shoes and a serviceable rapier i
hid my own clothes and then i left
a note saying i would call and return
the borrowed finery which by the bye
i never did

  as soon as i was outside the cottage
door i heard the sound of music beat-
thing through the extraordinary silence
like the sound of ten orchestras in one
it grew louder every moment as i ad-
vanced until at last i came to a village
green where a crowd of lads and las-
sies were dancing about a huge may-
pole in a fashion which i thought had
long been extinct

  i need not have been conscious of
my jacobean finery for everybody
there was dressed as i was although
in poorer quality i declare i shut my
eyes a score of times but every time
i reopened them the result was the
same it was the england of james i
or the america of the pilgrim fathers
and even the voices i heard spoke in
what i imagine to have been the quaint
seventeenth-century manner and were
charged with an extraordinary nasal
drawl

  i remained in hiding behind the trees
these people were english-speaking all
right but there was something else i
did not understand and it was this
something else that held me back
finally i worked my way round to the
other side of the green still taking
cover behind the trees until at last i
reached a point where a lane crossed
the line i was making it was over-
hung by huge branches from the trees
on either side with the green of the
trees all intermingled with the red and
the lost empire



yellow of the climbing seaweed and

lighted by the sun as by a lamp hung
overhead and away in the distance it
ended in a pair of beautifully carved
gates which i guessed to inclose some
kind of a private residence

  i had a fancy that some unseen force
of destiny pulled me along that quiet
lane away from the villagers and their
dancing i had no thought of whither
i was going and yet i strode along like
a man with a purpose until presently
i reached the carved gates and there
i found the little maid as i came after-
ward to call her staring curiously at
me through their patterned traceries

   in the elementaltnoments of life the
sham conventions which civilization has
built up  laboriously are thrust aside
as of no account i stood in the clois-
tered light of that path and i looked
at margery powell i forgot all the
sinister enchantments of this land i
was alone in the world with my dear
little maid and presently she opened
the carved gates as though an unseen
destiny were guiding her hand evfcn
as  had been guided across the world
to come to her and she came forward
to meet me there is not a day passes
that i do not recall the exquisite mem-
ory of that meeting it lies like rose
leaves in my mind it is the one hope
that sustains me

  how am i to tell you of my httle
maid  i might write forever and a day
of the willful straightness of her nose
or the dimpled temptations of her
rounded chin or the great gray eyes that
looked out fearlessly at a world in
which they saw no evil but what would
be the use some day i will find her
again and bring her here and then you
will know why i stayed so faithful to
her memory

  we met a score of times by the gates
of her fathers house she thought i
was from some other part of the con-
tinent and i dared not undeceive her
indeed it was rarely i troubled myself

about either her past or my own the
sale of a few pieces of jewelry i had
supported me andbeyond that i swear
i had not a thought apart from mar-
gery we drifted idly through a world
of daydreams content to take our hap-
piness as it came and caring naught of
past or future sometimes i tried to
persuade the little maid to trust herself
to me and i would take her to my own
home but she would never leave her
father although it was the weakness
of old roger powell that threatened to
ruin all of us

  i had cultivated a friendship with
him by this time and spent most of
my days at the manor house as they
called it he had another guest there
a hard-faced fellow who went by the
name of giles de lorimer if ever a
man had rogue written across his face
it was this same de lorimer i have
seen him look at my little maid so
lightly it has made my blood boil i
soon learned that roger powell liked
these looks no more than i did he
came up to me once as i sat in a broad
window ledge in the great hall

  you love my little wench he whis-
pened

  i could only sigh heavily whereat
he clapped me on the back

  never blow hot n cold mun he
roared gtt tot yarely ise warrant
the little baggage will gie thee yea
from now to lammas day here a
comes  he added hastily

  but it was de lorimer who entered
and roger shrugged his shoulders and
walked away i wondered if he had
some reason to fear this fellow but i
never connected it with his desire to see
margery wedded to me and when i
realized this it was too late

  about this time i had other troubles
my father was growing old and i had
left him in poor health i had merely
come away for a short cruise but had
already been in this land of enchant-
ment for nearly a month i had no


the lost empire

alternative but to return home  fol-
lowed squire powell and explained this
to him without telling him where my
home was or mentioning the aeroplane
 told him i would be back in a week
or two and then i would ask mar-
gery

  as thou wilt he said gloomily
the manner in which he looked at
de lorimer as he spoke stirred a quick
jealousy in me that sent me hot-foot
after the little maid to and fro about
the great house i went but she was
nowhere to be seen but i presently
met de lorimer who rose from a settle
as i came back to the great hall

   it seems that you and i have a reck-
oning to make he said sourly to which
i made him no reply i can never
speak when i am angered

  harkee master popinjay quoth
he  tis time to put a period to your
mooning round powells wench is that
plain enow

  i thought it was and i smote him
so furiously with my clenched fist that
he measured his length on the floor
he stumbled wildly to his feet clap-
ping his hand to his sword and swear-
ing he would have my hearts blood
but the sight of my own naked steel
at his throat fetched him up on that
count i do not think i have ever seen
so evil a look on a mans face

  vyoull pay scot and lot for that
he snarled youll find ere long i
am not what i seem

  i hope you are not i said and i
bowed to him over my sword point
the taunt passed him unheeded he
stood biting his nails and staring at me
and then he forced a sour smile a
lad that-can strike so shrewdly should
not be tied to a wenchs apron strings
he said if you are willing to take
service with a mort o brave soldados
i might say a good word for you
what service i asked curtly
why there is a prejudice against it
and yet tis honest enow you have

heard of the swamp lands that are all
about this country of america

  i have heard of them and of you
in the same sentence

  he looked cautiously to either side
before speaking  tis an el dorado
he whispered hoarsely i captain two-
score of good blades there myself all
day long they play with their cardes
at ruffe or slam or noddy or whisk or
whatsoeer they will or they throw the
dice or drain a tankard or lay a crab i
the fire for lambs wool the life is
purely pleasure

  what of the night

  why there are noble ships that have
drifted into the swamp lands and are
held by the golden seaweed there is
a mort of plunder in them and as for
their crews tis like slitting the throats
of dumb cattle they are so forspent with
hunger

  i made him no reply and he plucked
at the sleeve of my doublet

  what do you make of it  he whis-
pered evilly i will give ye the truth
as i live i am past my youth and
would settle here and the maid is
comely we would sit i the ingle nook

- nay i meant naught he cried

blankly

  keep her name out of thy reckon-
ing

  why then you shall go to my lads
with a goodly letter bidding them obey
you as myself you shall be their
leader and have the softest bed and the
biggest share of the plunder tis a
parlous good life

  but i could stand no more and i
bade him draw ere i thrust him through
where he stood he had no choice
but to defend himself and the quiet
room rang with the clatter of our blows
steel upon steel it seemed we had
both met our match i was younger
and stronger and i think of better
courage but he kept his feet more
firmly on the tiled floor every time
i struck at him i slipped and came
the lost empire



nigh to perishing and as last i flew
right off my feet and stumbled heavily
ere i could rise he was out of the
room and flying for his life

  he turned when he had gotten to a
safe distance and shouted some ribaldry
along the passageway but i only
laughed and went to meet the little
maid whom i had espied through the
window she stood at the edge of the
seaweed forest and there i went forth
to meet her

  i have a present for master god-
frey boone she said and gave me a
little letter

  and i have a present for mistress
margery powell i told her and i
gave her half a dozen good measure

  you have not read your letter she
whispered indeed it may hold some-
thing of moment

  indeed it may

  i wonder-- 

  it bids me question you straitly on
a certain matter what answer would
you give me

   tis foregone she pouted my
father hath hidden me give you naught
but yeas indeed i know not what
you might think to ask--

  wilt thou marry me margery

  i must obey my father she whis-
pered rosily

  you make me think of mine own
father i said he is sick and need-
eth comfort  must needs make a long
journey to see him and then i will re-
turn and claim thy promise

  she threw away all her pretty pre-
tense at that and bade me hasten back
for that she feared de lorimer was
plotting some evil against her father

i told her the fellow would not dare
to show his face again at powell manor
whereat she smiled through her tears

  indeed you may lay that ghost to
rest i said as i began to make my
farewrells i was minded to get away
quickly and leave for home that night
that i might return the sooner

  that indeed was what i did but had
i known what was to happen i would
have taken an ax and beaten the aero-
plane into a thousand pieces if i had
hut stayed to read the letter from roger
powell or if i had gone back to bid
him farewell ere i started all might
have been well rut the hand of des-
tiny was on me again and i was naught
but a puppet pulled this way and that

  it was dark when i swept up into
the air and began my long journey
home after the strange silence of
the lost continent as i have since
learned to call it the harsh whirring
of my propeller and later the booming
of the waves and all the noises of the
night were inexpressibly pleasant

  i reached the swamp lands just as
the moon was flooding the heavens and
the sight of the vast meadowland of
yellow seaweed with here and there
a black patch where some unlucky ship
had been driven in by the gales set
me thinking of de lorimer and his
gang of cutthroats my hand took
firmer clutch of the levers and i drove
the great plane toward the open sea
with hut the one thought-that i must
go quickly that i might return and
marry my little maid

  away in front of me i could see
a vast gulf with a thin backing of land
that seemed to join two continents each
of immeasurably greater size than the
one i had left i thought i was head-
ing for the gulf of mexico and swung
along what should have been the coast
of florida and then beat up north to
compass my way to newfoundland

but the same mischance overtook me
as on my outward journey i fell fast
asleep and knew no more until i wak-
ened over a crimson sea all ablaze with
the glory of the morning whether i
had changed my course i know not
but now i could see the long white-
capped ranges of the rocky mountains
to my right and far away to the left
the breakers of the pacific were thun-


the lost empire

dtering once more i turned and
headed across the vast grain fields of
the middle west and so at last i came
to the straits of can so and crossed
newfoundland to st johns

  my mistake had cost me dearly for
my father died a few hours before i
reached boone park it was a terrible
blow and even the little maid was for-
gotten for a time not until after the
funeral did my thoughts drift back to
the lost continent again and i went
to the hangar intending to prepare for
the return journey i found the over-
coat in which i had flown from the lost
continent and in one of the pockets
was the essaies on ye newe religion
by squire powells ancestor and in an-

other pocket was a crumpled piece of
paper i took it and read at last the
note which roger powell had written
me i think i read it half a score of
times ere the full import of its quaint
sentences beat their meaning into my
brain

  my deare ladd  i would have you know
that the matter whereof we spoke hath more
haste than i cared to tell you persuade the
little maid as you will but wed her swiftly
that rogue de lorimer hath choused me out
of hearth and home with his dice that are
surely cogged now he will cry quits if i

  will give him the wench to wife but this i
am npt minded to do though i scarce dare
say so to the foul pirate tis you can best
answer the rogue thine in all kindeness

roger powell

  within half an hour i swept into the
sky and headed for the south where
i judged the ixst continent to be i
flew over land and ocean north south
east and west now staring below me
until my eyes ached now falling asleep
in very weariness and as last i came
to earth in honduras and knew that
my search had failed

  if i had taken proper note of where
the lost continent lay if i had driven

to be concluded

tense moments

the figure of the man stooped over the lock the tense bent position of
his shoulders almost hid his face but from what one could discern ifi
the dim light his features did not appear to be those of an habitual
criminal beads of perspiration gathered thickly on his forehead and his breath
came in irregular gasps which told of the strain he was undergoing

  good heavens he muttered to himself i must have the right com-
bination the paper distinctly said ten turns to the right twelve to the left once
to the right again and all the way round will it never open

    far away in the distance clanged a bell at the sound of which he drew
forth a watch to see how long remained summoning up all his will power to
keep his nerves in check he essayed the task once more ah a cry of joy
burst from his lips this time the lock gave way under the manipulation of his
fingers the door swung back upon its hinges he put his arm inside and dragged
out his gymnasium costume

they say that if you kill a cobra
the mate will find the body and
so you can kill it as well how-
ever that may be i had this yam from
a man who hasnt the reputation of be-
ing too big a liar

  saunderson sahib was a hard man
and a harsh master he was of
the red-headed dour whisky-drinking
money-saving scotch type much given
to beating his servants when the ru-
mor circulated that he was going home
to bring a wife back with him the whole
station wondered what kind of a hus-
band he would make and speculated
if it was possible for him to make any
woman happy people felt rather
sorry for the new prospective mem-
sahib for kharnapur was a very dull
little station saundersons bungalow a
miserable thatched affair miles out in
the jungle and if she should happen

to be young and pretty-well-

  when she did finally come-just at

the start of the monsoon too-she
turned out to be both young and pretty
a little soft fluttery bit of a blond
woman given to squeaking at the sight
of a bug and shriveling up at the
thought of a mouse how such a fluffy
tender creature had come to marry a
man like saunderson was a mystery

  he must have been twenty years
older than she and in the way of money
and prospects had not much to offer
a girl like her he was in the forestry
department and of course there was
his pension later on still-

  the day he drove her out to her
future home in his ramshackle tumtum
she seemed a tragic little figure you
could see that she was the kind with
the terror of the jungle branded on
her soul thats the sort who should
never leave the security and safety of
their home town what would she not
have to go through in that lonely tum-
bledown bungalow of saundersons


the mate

  bats clustered about it the jungle
thereabouts was known for its tiger and
leopard and rumor had it that for years
two cobras had lived in the roof faith-
fully protected and fed by the hindu
servants by whom they were regarded
as sacred

  when a few days after she was set-
tled the other mem-sahibs of the sta-
tion called they found the poor little
soul shivering at the great gray spiders
that swung in the corners trembling
at the toads that hopped all about the
floor and the lizards that ran along the
bare whitewashed walls she repeated
all the stories that she had heard of
poisonous centipedes and scorpions
and begged to know if it was true about
the two snakes in the ceiling

  of course people in india must get
used to being surrounded by all manner
of unpleasant live stock  if they dont
their nerves get shattered the bugs
have all sorts of accomplishments one
small black specie being possessed of
a smell so highly disagreeable that you
have no doubt when one is on you or
when one has fallen into your soup
cockroaches as big as mice that fly
spiders that hop frogs that fly-but to
get on with the story

  poor little mrs saundersons dread
of snakes became a positive obsession
at a rustle in the ceiling cloth above
her head she would scream she never
walked out in the compound after sun-
set without having a chokidar carry a
lantern before her saunderson should
have sent her up to the hills at this
stage of the game but he didnt and
she grew thin and lost all her pretty
color too rapidly her eyes seemed
haunted by a perpetual terror

  instead of her husband being sympa-
thetic and trying to reason the little
woman out of her exaggerated fears
he grew impatient with her denounced
it all as nonsense and hysteria and de-
clared hed cure her of her foolishness
or know the reason why and yet in

his way i suppose he was fond of
her

  things went from bad to worse until
jeanie saunderson positively disgraced
her husband by shrieking and fainting
at the deputy commissioners garden
party when she imagined a snake had
crawled over her foot as soon as
she came to saunderson proceeded to
explain that all snakes were harmless
unless provoked but the lecture did
not seem to comfort the little woman
she was white as a sheet and trembling
all over and begged to go home as
she was feeling ill saunderson com-
plied irritably and i suppose scolded
her mercilessly the whole way home

  after this she tried bravely to over-
come her fears she never talked bugs
or bats she never referred to the snakes
reputed to be in the roof she said
thomas-that was his name-forbade
her to dwell on such things but
though her lips were silent you could
feel the dread of creeping and crawling
things that was gnawing at her and see
the growing horror in her frightened
gray eyes people suggested that saun-
derson send the mem-sahib home but
he chewed the ragged edge of his mus-
tache and said that before long hed
make a pucca old anglo indian of her

  but he never did perhaps he did
what he thought was for the best hes
dead now out on the burning sands of
mesopotamia so its not for us to judge

  one stifling july night when the
damp earth seemed to steam foully
saunderson and his wife sat in their
living room under the slow swinging
punkah he was smoking a burma
cheroot and reading the glasgow her-
ald she was sewing furtively on a bit
of white muslin which she held under
the table as if to hide it from her hus-
band little beads of perspiration
stood out on her forehead every once
in a while she peered fearfully about
her drawing her feet up under her
onto the rungs of her chair
the mate



  the lamp burned flickeringly as a
host of winged ants whirled about it
a huge moth flew in nearly brushing
the girls face she shrank back but
made no sound

  saunderson read on steadily for an
hour sipping slowly at his peg and oc-
casionally reading aloud an item of
war news but she did not seem to
be listening the needle flashed in her
thin little hand and she seemed to be
trying to make up her mind to tell her
husband something she bent lower
over her sewing she was working on
a tiny sleeve once or twice she looked
over at him a wistful smile twisting
her lips but she did not dare disturb
him

  suddenly it was as if every nerve
in her body became agonizingly taut
something in the ceiling cloth above
her head was moving then it sagged
heavily in the corner and almost be-
fore jeanies piercing scream a large
cobra dropped heavily onto the floor

  saunderson sprang to his feet the
snake paused reared its head spread-
ing its hood its hiss and the gleam of
its evil eyes were the last things the
girl remembered saunderson snatched
up an old golf club standing in the
comer he had put up with the nonsense
of his servants long enough with half
a dozen well-directed blows he mashed
in the cobras head a sickening smear
of blood showed where it writhed out
its last agony

  saunderson bent over his kill with
satisfaction what an ugly brute it
was-over six feet long and a splendid
hood he turned to call his wife to
look at it

  she was lying back in her chair her
wrenched face drawn and haggard her
hands clutched convulsively at the bit
of sewing saundersons voice roused
her

  jeanie come here  he commanded
look at this beauty just take a good

long look and it will overcome all your
absurd nervousness

  no thomas she said faintly i
canna come

  dont be ridiculous he said in an-
noyance come when i call you

  she shuddered moving her lips in
mute appeal but saunderson did not
see her agony to him it was but stub-
bornness and stupidity was it not a
well-known fact that being face to face
with such terrors made people realize
how harmless they were had not
he as a small boy been shut up in a
black closet to cure him of his dread
of the dark  so he would handle
jeanie

  come here he repeated but when
she did not move he caught up the dead
snake across the golf club and carried
it carefully toward her

  with a moan of terror she fled from
him into her room

  something of the cruel and tyranni-
cal awoke in saunderson he followed
her quickly and flung the body of the
snake after her through the open door
then with a curse he slammed it shut
shoving the bolt and locking her in
see if that wont cure her of her
damned foolishness he muttered and
mopping his forehead went back to his
newspaper and tried to read

  but he could not concentrate his
mind on the print from the next room
came heartrending cries and sobs an
occasional hysterical shriek and the
pounding of little futile fists against
the bolted door

  her voice came in broken prayers
she begged him to let her out he
could not make out what she was say-
ing but sat staring grimly at the news-
paper before him he heard her move
to the small windows shaking at the
iron bars and then she came back again
to the door

  suddenly saunderson heard a pierc-
ing scream the blood chilled in his


the mate

veins  it was the terrible cry of a soul
in ghastly peril he laid down the
paper rising irresolutely it was dark
in the next room perhaps he was
frightening her too badly still it would
cure her for all time of her insane
nervousness about bugs and snakes
had he not shrieked and beaten him-
self in vain fury against the closet
walls when as a small boy he had
been locked in and it had done the
trick he had never dared fear the dark
again it would have the same effect
on jeanie even now she had stopped
crying there was a strange silence

  saunderson tiptoed across the room
he fancied he heard a low moaning
wail yes she was cured he might
let her out now she had been locked
in with that dead cobra long enough
now she would realize how childish
she had been

  jeanie he called in a gentler voice
than he had ever used to her before
wyou can come out now

  he let slip the bolt and waited for
the answer that did not come

  -shes angry saunderson thought
sullenly just like a woman to get
the sulks well shell have to get over

  he flung open the door a flood
pf yellow lamplight fell across the mat-
ting of the floor in the middle of

the room stood the two iron beds with
their square canopies of mosquito net-
ting and lying half across them a
crumpled little figure face downward

  jeanie said saundersor from the
doorway there was no reply he
took an impatient step into the room
something rustled stirred hissed he
started back nearly grinding under his
heel the dead body of the cobra he had
killed

  a cold sweat broke out on his fore-
head his imagination must be playing
tricks with him his wife had fainted
that was it she had simply fainted
perhaps he should not have locked her
in he crossed to her side bending
over her and picked her up in his arms
how limp she was how cold he laid
her down on the bed in the half light
he could see the tears still wet on her
thin little cheeks and clinging to the
lashes of her glassy wide-open eyes

  jeanie cried saunderson for the
last time then suddenly he fell on
his knees beside the bed oh my
god my god he sobbed trying to
chafe her icy hands

  a rustle sounded above his held the
corner of the ceiling cloth bulged un-
der a gliding black weight but the
man did not look up or see the cobra
that had come down and avenged the
death of its mate

chapter v

the chang yan

when rosemonde burley be-
coming impatient with the
lack of shipping took passage
from saigon on the unspeakably vile
chinese junk chang yan officialdom
was scandalized but the imperturb-

able rosemonde with her widows
weeds and her croix de guerre was
not a person to be interfered with
rather they decided mournfully she
was a person to be married-alas

  if i am to have charge of a nursing
station at ben-ho up the coast she
declared i am not going to rot in
saigon fttes amis this junk is going
o

the opium ship

there voila t you will not send me
therefore i go unsafe bah after
my brave american was killed at
chateau-thierry did i not drive an
ambulance at the front  did not mon-
sieur le president himself decorate me
with the cross bah ill snap my
fingers at those yellow men if they say
two words to me and i can use an
automatic pistol eh assuredly

  she simply refused to be interfered
with every one at saigon knew her
sad and glorious story-how she had
married an american an officer among
the first in france how he had fallen
but a few weeks later how rosemonde
had gone to avenge him with an am-
bulance  and how the war ended she
had come out to the colonies to take
up nursing duty not for money
either since it was saidthat she was
wealthy enough to enjoy life had she
so desired

  eh bicn said the governor gen-
eral the night the chang yan sailed
as over the dinner table he told his
guests about rosemonde burley
there is the spirit of france for you
there nom dun nom but she will
meet adventure that woman she is
of a great spirit a flame is in her
as for the junk i think it is safe
enough

  rosemonde thought the chang van
safe enough also except for sixteen
chinamen she was the only person
aboard but she had a decent cabin
was waited on with great respect and
the captain was a humorous soul named
hi lung who spoke a little french and
grinned often

  true the junk was a junk with a
big eye painted on either bow a bamboo
sail or two and a sublime faith in
heaven she stank abominably her
cargo was supposed to be rotten copra
from siam and was consigned to nan-
king so no one asked what it really
was but the first day out when rose-
monde saw the yellow mate break out

a five-tael tin of opium from a sack
of rotten copra she guessed that this
would prove a lively voyage it did

  in the far east as in the far west
the world war has appreciably affected
the general conditions of life and par-
ticularly of womans life rosemonde
burley although by reason of her mar-
riage an american citizen and proud
of it had found no difficulty in obtain-
ing a colonial post from france be-
hind the lines and ahead of the lines
rosemonde had seen many things and
had done many things she had pulled
a loaded ambulance out of hell and had
shot three treacherous boches while do-
ing it

  she was perfectly able to use an
automatic without wincing but this did
not imply that she was an unwomanly
virago far from it every line of
her trim petite body expressed a vig-
orous womanhood a sweetly feminine
allure she was not beautiful perhaps
but she had the great gift that is be-
yond beauty-a spirit gently great ten-
derly strong and she had learned in
the bitter crucible to take care of her-
self with an aggressive swiftness like
many another who had passed through
the great war she now laughed at the
worst which the world might proffer

  one who has been through hell she
would say laughing does not fear
purgatory eh and this was true
rosemonde feared nothing

  on the morning after leaving saigon
the junk was out of sight of land-
which was not as it should be captain
hi lung grinned and winked humor-
ously about it saying that the eyes on
the bow of the chang van had become
crossed and were seeing crooked but
at noon he fussed with his queer in-
struments and pored over his queer
charts with absorbed interest and an
hour later the junk caught the tip of
the hurricane that had swept the san
gregorio away from manila by night
all was serene again and the sails
the opium ship



hoisted and hi lung stated that in the
morning they would be within sight of
land

  but when morning came there was
no land

  rosemonde was not aware of the fact
until nearly noon for she was looking
forward to hard work and believed in
sleeping while the sleeping was good
when she did come on deck she found
that not only was land out of sight but
the junk seemed to be heading east
rather than north-a strange thing
since cape padaran must have long ago
been rounded rosemonde verified her
facts by her watch compass then looked
for the skipper he was again work-
ing with his charts and instruments on
the after deck

  it was at this moment that rose-
monde first realized that she was not
the only passenger aboard sitting be-
side the captain and inspecting the
charts was a stranger-a yellow man
also but dressed in european clothes
and very well dressed to boot he had
the same odd cast of features as most
of the other men aboard that is in-
stead of owning the oblique eyes of
the usual son of han he had very
straight brows and eyes

  having comprehended these facts in
about ten seconds rosemonde turned
and went below again to her stateroom
it was a rough bare little chamber
formed by knocking two former cabins
into one for a few moments she sat
quietly her brown eyes reflectively
studying the little gilt buddha set
against the wall near the entrance she
had set her door ajar and left it so

  if there were anything queer about
this cruise she deduced the strange
passenger had something to do with it
to deal with hi lung would lead to
nothing in such case rosemonde be-
lieved in going to headquarters and
it looked as though the stranger were
headquarters in this instance she
knew also that there was a cabin ad-

joining hers because she had seen the
china boy who served as steward go-
ing in there with dishes the evening
previous

  knowing better than to attempt any
explanation out on deck where trouble
was too apt to be precipitated with the
crew shuffling around rosemonde took
her automatic and went out into the
deserted passage at the door of the
adjoining cabin she knocked there was
no reply she tried the door found it
unlocked and entered closing the door
behind her

  this cabin was as bare as her own
two suit cases standing against one
wall and a burberry raincoat flung over
the bunk this proved that the strange
passenger was the owner since he alone
seemed to wear european clothes and
that burberry had not been obtained
outside a british colony rosemonde
sat down and waited composedly

  twenty minutes later the door
opened and the strange passenger en-
tered his cabin he did not see rose-
monde until he had closed the door
and started toward his bunk then he
looked into the mbuth of her automatic
and obeyed her instantly

  sit down and be quiet she said
in a calm voice what is your name
please 

  the yellow man was obviously as-
tonished and disconcerted any yellow
man would be upon finding a white
girl in his cabin and an automatic un-
der his nose

  i am chan mow su he said
slightly agitated ah-you are ma-
dame burley

  to her surprise he spoke very good
french certainly she responded
coolly i do not intend to hurt you
but i desire information you seem
to know all about me who are you
and where is this ship going

  if you will allow me he said po-
litely i will hand you my card

  she nodded but watched him nar-


the opium ship

rowly as he produced a handsome card-
case and selected a card which he ex-
tended upon the card were the words
in english prince chan mow su
sat on road bangkok wholesale
imports and exports

  may i ask what has disturbed you
he inquired smoothly i gave strict

orders-

  i am here to ask questions before
answering them said rosemonde
what have you to do with this ship
and where is she going

  the prince had by this time quite
recovered his bland composure

  she is chartered to me and is going
to land you at ben-ho-ultimatelyhe
replied he was a bulky man square-
jawed and obviously no ones fool
when i heard at saigon that you were
seeking to take passage i ordered cap-
tain hi lung to accommodate you i
trust there was no- harm in that i
had not intended to intrude myself upon
you

  rosemonde met his smiling gaze
frowning a little

  if you are going to land me at ben-
ho why are you heading to the east 
she asked

  unfortunately madame we have
urgent business which must be attended
to you shall reach your destination
without harm and with very slight de-
lay--m

  i think you had better go directly
up the coast to benho and land me
then attend to your private business
said the girl writh disconcerting direct-
ness i paid for a passage upon such
an assumption captain hi lung has
lied to me consistently i think you
had better do this

  unfortunately we cannot returned
the other we are supposed to meet
another ship at a certain definite time
in a certain definite spot a great deal
of money depends upon it after the
meeting you shall be landed---

  fm tired of evasions monsieur

cut in rosemonde coldly i am not
to be trifled with to be frank i dont
believe a word of your story and i
have no intentions of being calmly ab-
ducted you are not a prince for there
are no princes in china therefore

  for the love of heaven inter-
rupted the yellow man desperately
you are unreasonable no one is ab-
ducting you i can give you every
proof of my identity these men aboard
have known me for years and i am
not a chinaman i am a manchu as
my features testify and a prince of the
manchus

  no matter said rosemonde un-
moved you have opium in the cargo
and i think your entire story is a lie
you are evidently engaged upon some
illegal business into which you have
no right to drag me besides ships
do not meet each other in mtd-ocean
as you are doing unless there is some-
thing very wrong i do not choose to
be a party to such things you compre-
hend

  prince chan said something in man-
darin which sounded like curses

  you are taking a wrong view of
everything he broke out but ma-
dame how can you help yourself
bosemonde eyed him calculatingly

  i can shoot you through the right
foot she observed and thus render
you incapable of further action i can
do a great deal of damage in fact and
i propose to do it unless this ship is
headed for the coast immediately

  the manchu met her gaze for a mo-
ment in her eyes he read an un-
flinching purpose and for a moment
his own black eyes flickered with ad-
miration when he spoke it was
smoothly and in bland accents that told
he was setting himself not to cope with
a woman but to conquer an adversary

  madame burley will you listen to
me a moment i shall be frank with
you these men in this ship are man-
the opium ship



chus like myself members of the same
trading guild associates with me and
with other manchu princes in a large
organization this guild of ours col-
lected over a million dollars worth of
opium in bangkok siam we leased
from the chinese republic the privilege
of retailing this opium in certain prov-
inces of china at the last moment
we learned that president hsu shih-
chang had not only revoked the license
of our syndicate but had also destroyed
the twelve hundred chests of opium al-
ready in shanghai-worth fourteen
millions in dollars-ninety million
francs v

  yes broke in the girl scornfully
china has a better president than a
manchu would ever make-an opium
dealer who calls himself a prince to
the disgrace of his ancestors 

  the yellow features of prince chan
darkened slightly at this thrust

  accordingly he pursued we re-
solved to save the wreck of our for-
tunes by turning over this opium at
bangkok to another party who would
dispose of it elsewhere we are now
on our way to meet this other party
the meeting you understand has long
been arranged now that i have been
absolutely frank with you holding back
nothing i trust that you will give your
assent to our plans they will not
inconvenience you madame you will
have nothing whatever to do with the
opium transaction you will in no way
be connected with it can you not
madame burley adjust yourself to the
situation  believe me he added softly
you will lose nothing by it

  this final subtle suggestion which
might have been a veiled hint either of
threat or of bribery was a mistake and
a costly mistake

  up until that instant rosemonde had
been watching the prince with calmly
reflective interest held by his air of
earnestness by his fluent french by
his obvious appeal to her sympathies

by the very confidence reposed in her
but that veiled suggestion at the end
chilled and penetrated through her hes-
itation unreasonably perhaps it an-
gered her

  are you going to head for the coast
and land me at ben-ho  she de-
manded quietly

  grand dieu cried the manchu
staring at her have you no reason


in your

  that is not the question she re-
turned acidly do i understand then
that you refuse to fulfill your contract
with me

  i  i refuse nothing i shall go
this instant and give the orders-

  prince chan started to his feet as
he spoke an air of resignation masking
his face and took a step forward
then without warning he lurched
against the girl she fired but he had
struck her hand aside and the bullet
went into the ceiling he struck again
and she staggered under the blow that
smote her cheek

  she had not expected this actual
physical encounter although she had in-
vited it and she was taken unawares
the manchu swept the door open be-
fore she could fire again and was gone
she could hear his voice shrilling com-
mands and then caught the thin clear
note of a whistle

  with that she left the cabin and
turned into her own doorway she
had failed and did not know what to
expect of her failure she locked her
door and waited weapon in hand the
anger that seethed within her was furi-
ous and against her pale cheek the
mark of the blow stood out redly the
very fact that she had failed so utterly
that her impulsive actions had ended
in such a fiasco made her the more
furious she might have expected a
blow from the manchu but it had not
occurred to her that he would behave
to har as to a man she failed to re-
alize that his blows had provided the


the opium ship

gentlest method of escape from her
weapon

  it is quite idle to assert that the mind
of a woman runs in the same grooves
as the mind of a man-particularly as
regards cause and effect it does not
it has grooves all its own rosemonde
burley considered that she had reason
to fight she had begun to fight and
she intended to go on fighting she
entirely ignored the fact that prince
chan had displayed an amazing trust
in giving her the details of his enter-
prise-an absolutely illegal enterprise
she ignored his attempt to reason with
her she remembered only his conclud-
ing words which constituted either a
bribe or a threat and his blow

  presently she heard a gentle knock
at her door and she lifted her weapon

  madame v sounded the voice of the
manchu there was a new note in the
voice a note of purring menace to-
morrow morning at ten oclock we
reach our destination if you will yield
to reason and-

  rosemonde had been calculating
from which side of the door that voice
had come she knew that the speaker
was not standing squarely before the
door now she aimed carefully and
pulled the trigger the deafening roar
of the explosion filled the cabin and a
round hole appeared in the door panel

  for a moment there was no indica-
tion of the result of her shot the
door being in a chinese junk opened
outward watching the door rose-
monde saw it shiver and thud suddenly
as though something had fallen against
it then she heard the voice of prince
chan again

  very well madame said the man-
chu we accept your verdict--and
you shall be tamed when you have
had enough of thirst and hunger you
may surrender until then you stay
where you are i need another wife
madame a white wife this time that
honor shall be yours au revoir

  rosemonde fired once again but only
a laugh mocked her aim once more
the door gave a shivering thud and
again stepping toward it she un-
locked and tested it the door was sol-
idly blocked shut probably by coils of
line she locked it again

  turning the girl opened her suit
case which lay upon the bunk she
took out rolls of chocolate tins of
french biscuit a package of tinned del-
icacies which had been given her by a
saigon official and a folding stove with
hard alcohol burners

  hunger bah f she shrugged her
shoulders her gaze went to the water
pitcher in the corner which had been
filled that morning thirst non-
sense  she looked at the large square
port which was open and smiled at
the sunlit sea marriage there is
the escape he is a fool this yellow
prince

  and sitting down she composedly
began to clean her automatic pistol

chapter vi

the sea tryst

paptain canaughan des-
mond and osullivan sat smoking
in their cabin the afternoon after
canaughans rescue all three had
slept long and lustily but the skipper
was chafing under enforced inaction
he had adopted a growling acquies-
cence in the situation but reserved his
right to the utmost freedom of speech
juliana was in her own apartment

  what i want to know said the
skipper glaring at desmond is why
ye dont get to work take the ship
by to-morrow night ye said well its
to-morrow night to-night ye lazy
hound and you sitting there grinning

  i mind reading a pome said osul-
livan softly and reminiscently ruffling
up his long black hair in a magazine
twas wrote about ireland which was
called erin and it was wrote by a guy
the opium ship



named kennedy only he spelled his
name cinneidhe to show he had the
gaelic in which he was a liar because
he spelled mhutrnin like tom moore
spelled it and heaven knows theres

no gaelic in it that way-

  what are ye interrupting me for
blast your impudence  exclaimed cap-
tain canaughan whats this fool
pome of yours got to do with what im
say in 

  im cornin to that retorted the fid-
dler dye mind there was only one
true word in that pome sir for a
fact there was and that was where
he spoke about an ulsterman always

improving-

  true for ye there interjected the
skipper an ulsterman always does

improve----

  -like bad fish in july added

osullivan slyly throwing desmond a
wink

  hells bells roared the skipper fu-
riously if ye were not a little runt
of a man not worth me attention id
break your hack over me knee ye little
herring oh laugh blast the two of
ye wait till we set foot ashore you
desmond and ill wipe the laugh off
that mug of yours when are ye go-
ing to put a bullet into that slimy
arevalo will ye tell me

  give him until to-morrow noon
chuckled desmond puffing contentedly
at a cheroot whats ailing you any-
how  were comfortable here its
arevalo thats doing the work and the
worrying if we havent discovered
what his game is by noon or why hes
heading into the china sea well take
back the ship and go home does that
suit ye

  canaughan frowned over his pipe
ill tell ye what he said i dont
like it before we left port arevalo
came to me and wanted to run a bit
of dope-opium mind ill not say but
what id obliged him before in a small

way-

  sbtb

  and you a righteous man queried
desmond whimsically but never
mind go on

  but he had somethin big on his
mind proceeded the skipper and
having the owner aboard i told him no
so he gave it up and wanted a passage
down to mindoro which i was glad
enough to grant now then im
thinking that maybe hes trying to put
over the opium game somehow what
it is i dont know for he would not
go into details

  likely enough said desmond in-
differently well let him go to it
but dont ye see the authorities
would raise hell with us canaughan
glared at him heaven knows its a
fishy enough story well have to tell
and it the honest truth from start to
finish but if theres a smell of dope

to it then-

  dont fret and desmond yawned
instead of killing him well take him

in alive-

  blast your bloody bored teeth 
roared the skipper exasperated have
ye no atom of sense cannot ye see

that-

  at this point osullivan produced his
fiddle and the bridge muted drew his
bow across the strings in a wailing air
that filled the cabin with a croon of
melody the burly skipper was hushed
instantly and did not speak until osul-
livan paused then

  ye have the gift he exclaimed
grudgingly i suppose ye never heard
a tune that went by the name of mayo
county or some such thing i re-
member me old grandmother who had
a bent for them papistical airs used

to hum it-

  the fiddler tightened a peg and
struck into the slow-swinging minors
requested and grizzled old canaughan
sat with pipe gripped hard in his teeth
until the last note had died then he
sighed and rose to make ready for bed
despite his apparent carelessness


the opium ship

desmond thought long and hard that
night as he stared into the darkness
while the san gregorio lurched west-
ward he felt that trouble was brew-
ing arevalo had not molested them
which boded ill and desmond won-
dered if it were wise to postpone re-
taking the ship

  still on the morrow both he and
canaughan would be fully recovered
fully themselves the schooner would
not be regained without a fight that
was certain and thus far desmond had
formed no scheme for managing the
fight without bloodshed his chief
worry was dona juliana whose nature
demanded protection and shielding
rather than a share in the fray

  poor little girl he thought pity-
ingly shes bearing up bravely under
it all and well get her safe home again
somehow its a sweet heart she has
and no mistake now that she knows
were all gentlemen shes warming up
to us elegantly all the fine lady of
her and the high-born airs will be gone
in another day or two and shell be
a fine jewel of a girl for any man alive

to be dreaming about- oh well

youre a poor divil of a broken irish-
man gerald desmond with nothing
ahead of ye except maybe to go to
america like your ancestors and see
what the land o freedom has to offer
ye theres no thinking of marriage
for the likes of you me lad

  he smiled into the darkness

  maybe now he reflected therell
be a bit of luck waiting around the cor-
ner to hit me over the head maybe
ill strike a fortune like the lads in
books or find a bag of pearls some-
where in these seas or strike a guano
island what the devil is guano i
wonder if it smells anything like
what arevalo burned when he shuffled
don gregorio into paradise then an
island of it would want no finding im

thinking- he slid into sleep un-

worrying about the morrow

  as for juliana she had to some ex-
tent laid aside her grief for her father
and was applying her energies to the
present moment she was entirely
aware of her own beauty and within
the past twenty-four hours had become
aware of something else namely that
gerald desmond was the only man she
had ever met who seemed oblivious to
her beauty

  to be sure he was as gallant as any
one in manila had been he uttered
warm phrases and the most adroit flat-
teries and he had established himself
upon an intimate and familiar footing
such as juliana had never dreamed she
would grant to any man-even her fu-
ture husband yet somehow she was
disagreeably aware that desmond
would have acted precisely in the same
fashion with any one else whom he had
happened to like and that his familiar-
ity and intimacy were entirely as aloof
and respectful as were the dumbly ad-
miring stares of osullivan she was
getting to understand desmond or
rather to appreciate him

  she could not forget too that he
was an extremely handsome man his
eyes were handsgme and warm and
while his finely chiseled features had
nothing of the adonis in them they
were alive with a tremendously virile
strength and sureness and he was a
gentleman in the truest sense of the
word filled with a high courtesy and
chivalry which the girl divined and
which struck fire from her gothic
blood she congratulated herself that
such a man had been at hand to check-
mate arevalo for whom she felt only
repulsion and hatred

  with the following morning juliana
moved by obscure impulses descended
into the rat-ridden darkness of the run
got up cabin stores worked for an hour
and aroused the three men in the ad-
joining cabin with a beaming summons
to breakfast she was delighted by
their astonishment although none of
the opium ship

them perhaps realized that it was about
the first useful thing she had ever done
in her life but juliana was awaken-
in-

  stand by until noon commanded
desmond when captain canaughan re-
newed his importunities if nothings
turned up by then well turn up our-
selves the only way we can get out
since theyve barricaded the door is
to use the window and climb over the
rail and whos going first eh 

  ive a pack o cards in me fiddle
case suggested osullivan we
might have a bit game unless it would
offend the righteousness of the skip-

  it would not said canaughan
gloomily although therell be no
blessin on such ungodly doins to my
way of thinking and as to going
first im willing enough

  settle it with the cards approved
desmond more to keep the skipper oc-
cupied than anything else

  but queried juliana looking from
one to the other where shall  be

  right here jewel of the world and
desmond laughed and when its all
over-

  at that minute the schooner gave a
shuddering lurch which nearly threw
them out of their seats

  aground cried the fiddler run-
ning to the stern windows which were
kept shuttered and bolted against any
possible attempt from arevalo to gain
entrance that way

  aground where cried canaughan
scornfully theres no reef the way
weve been driving not a speck o
coral even weve run alongside an-
other ship thats what feel her lift
an heave some ones had sense
enough to put out fenders balderson
most like hes the one good seaman in
all that scum blast him 

  osullivan got the iron shutters tom
open by the time they joined him  his
pinched eager face was framed against

the blue sky the silence of incredulity
fell upon them as they crowded beside
him until presently canaughan spoke

  plain enough now he said bitterly
arevalo and that blasted mate o mine
were in together on the deal the mate
laid a course for here smashed my tell-
tale and smashed the engines likewise
so that id be able to make no trouble
in case i was locked below well the
mates got his deserts praise be
would ye look at that now oh the
blasted lubbers  look at em handle
the lines v

  beside the schooner lay a chinese
junk rather she had lain beside a mo-
ment before but was now drifting
slightly astern and thus within the
range of vision of those at the san gre-
gorios stem window

  there was a long swinging swell to
the ocean because of which it had ob-
viously been found impracticable that
the two craft could lie side by side
as canaughan explained it to the other
three the schooner was slowly forging
ahead under reduced canvas thus hold-
ing the junk slightly astern  a cable had
already been made fast and a second
cable was now being made fast in the
rigging of the junk upon whose deck
great activity was manifest

  talk about your bold simplicity
growled the skipper watching through
his glasses that junk has come out
into the china sea with a cargo of
opium and shes goin to transfer the
dope to us and arevalo runs it back
into the islands he can land the whole
blasted lot at mindoro and never a
question asked

  would he land it at our plantation
asked juliana

  most like theyre rigging up a
conveyor on that second cable aloft
and in ten minutes theyll be shooting
the stuff over blast em

  give me those binoculars canau-
ghan said desmond suddenly ive
seen something


the opium ship

  the skipper grunted and complied
desmond raised the glasses and focused
upon a square window amidships of
the junk at which his eyes had caught
a flutter of white

  as he gazed he saw the window
swing open and the binoculars brought
to him every detail of the womans face
which was framed in the opening the
others were absorbed in watching the
preparations to transship cargo and
desmond said nothing of his discovery
he saw the woman standing staring at
the schooner and she was a white
woman for an instant he shifted his
gaze and scanned the decks of the junk
but could see no white man aboard
returning to the woman searching her
features with puzzled eyes he could
not resist the impression that she was
white frightened tragic desmond
slowly moved his hand across his breast
as in signal and she answered with a
like gesture

  miss juliana  desmond turned
and beckoned the girl beside him to
the window look yonder see if
that woman answers your gestures and
motion her to be careful

  a scant fifty feet of water separated
the two vessels dona juliana made
signals as desmond had requested
then laid her finger to her tips and
turned around

  what does it mean  she asked
who is that woman

  i dont know said desmond but
 find out mr canaughan whos
bawling out in chinese from up above
is that cook of yours an old hand

  a new one-just shipped him in
manila said the skipper who with
osullivan was now scrutinizing the
woman aboard the junk ah shes
gone why thats the cook talkin
i expect think he was an agent in
this blasted dope running

  sure of it assented desmond
they look like manchus aboard the

junk there and he was a manchu too
straight eyes you know and a different
air

  a celestial with a megaphone was
standing in the bows of the junk talk-
ing with some one on the schooners
deck for the present however des-
mond was confident that every one con-
cerned had been too absorbed in the
work on hand to notice either the
woman at her window or the figures
at the stem window of the schooner

  leaving the other three to discuss the
junk desmond went into the forward
cabin he felt himself once more and
he was ready for action gerald des-
mond was essentially unable to depend
upon any one but himself he was made
that way when he wanted a thing
done he did it in his own fashion he
had learned to be aggressively self-de-
pendent and it was at times a bad
habit but when it came to action des-
mond was all alone in his special field
in action he was transformed the
lounging drawl the slow-moving indo-
lence was gone from him in a flash
one realized suddenly what tremen-
dous possibilities lay in the man he
became a living flame of audacity

  feeling one of the mattresses which
he and the fiddler had brought in from
the other cabin desmond found what
he sought-a filling of straw he car-
ried it back into the other cabin ripping
at it with his knife

  now then he said and at the ring
in his voice the others turned from the
window stay away from there a few
minutes if ye please we dont want
to attract attention thats right leave
the window open but keep out o sight
from the junk

  talk about piracy exclaimed cap-
tain canaughan watching the destruc-
tion of the mattress whats goin
on anyhow you aiming to bum my
own ship under me

  desmond did not reply for a mo-
the optum ship

ment he finished ripping the ticking
and from the mattress produced a huge
double armful of straw which he placed
in a heap beneath the window

  whats that woman doing on that
junk he said straightening up
shes a white woman and shes in
trouble eh 

  weye in a sight more trouble said
the skipper if youre so much wor-
ried about her why dont you go ask
her 

  thats what im going to do said
desmond calmly michael terence
will you be finding that bucket o lard
and grease this automatic o mine good
and heavy

  what cried juliana her gray eyes
widening at him youre not going
to sunm

  if you give me a chance to slip
overboard in decency i am and des-
mond grinned

  there was a moments silence while
they stared at him amazedly then
desmond turned and lifting the
straw dropped it out of the window
in a mass

  oh you cant mean to swim over
there exclaimed doha juliana
think what it will mean-either the
chinese will see you or our own crew 
they may even shoot at you

  i dont doubt they would if they
saw me commented desmond lightly
but theyll not see me now miss
juliana will you have the kindness to
step into the other cabin for a minute
im w earin the skippers clothes you
understand and im sure itll warm
his blood to know that im not going to
take em all with me eh skipper get
that gun ready michael terence for
ill be needing it

  they  see you drop over said the
skipper sourly

  thats the chance was desmonds
cheerful response heres the rope
we brought in the other night pass

it out and  slide down to avoid a
splash the odds are even that are-
valos bunch is working by one of the
main hatchways and those chinks may
not notice me

  youre running your head into a
net ye big fool said canaughan pick-
ing up the line ye see a pretty face
-and bang goes all sense

  desmond looked at him a moment
his eyes cold

  ill put some sense into you when
we step ashore my bucko he said
quietly

  youll be welcome to try returned
the skipper my only fear is that yell
not live to see the day you and your
wild ways so take care of yourself
for the sake of the trimming ill give
ye

  desmond stripped to his underwear
buckled around his waist his belt with
the automatic which the fiddler had
larded

  im off he said if theyve seen
the straw floating theyll have grown
used to it by this time be good to
yourself michael terence

  the fiddler his pinched features
flushed with excitement hung to des-
monds hand

  wait a minute now when are ye
coming back sir the capn here was
sayin wed catch that storm back on
us again and divu knows what wed

do if you didnt show up-

  ill go aboard that junk if i get
a chance said desmond if i do
and you hear any shooting then climb
out and kick arevalo into the sea we
might as well take the junk home with
us and make a clean sweep of it eh
thunder o finn thats an idea skip-
per  ill do it anyhow remember
now-when ye hear the shooting boot
arevalo and boot him hard good-by
and good luck to ye

  heaven help ye v returned the skip-
per dourly ye have need of the help


the opium ship

chapter vii

desmond adventures

oosemonde burley was to-
tally unable to understand the
queer spectacle at the stem of the
schooner she saw the faces in the
window just over the painted words
san gregorio  and she comprehended
that those faces were staring at the
bank in obvious amazement then just
as she had decided to send a call for
help desmond had brought dona juli-
ana to the opening and there had come
that signal for caution

  on the schooners deck above rose-
monde could see a yellow man shout-
ing through a megaphone and could
hear prince chan replying but the
schooner seemed to be manned by
whites or half-castes arevalo in com-
mand with balder son seemed some sort
of native but balderson was manifestly
white as were the others and then
desmond at the cabin window had
flung out a great heap of straw which
clung against the ships stem

  rosemonde was not starved but most
of her provisions were used up and
all her water was gone her door was
effectually blocked from the outside
as she watched the schooners stem
window she saw a rope flung out and
shortly afterward appeared desmond
he slid down swiftly into the water-
and did not come up

 the girl watched wide-eyed per-
plexed and alarmed no one seemed
to have observed desmond yet where
had he gone then she saw the straw
jerk slightly as it floated and she un-
derstood presently the straw began
to move toward the junk the whole
heap of it until as it drew closer it
was lost to her range of vision she
sat breathless waiting for a voice from
below but no voice came

 rosemonde had not deluded herself
with hopes of succor from the schooner
which could carry only accomplices of

the manchu prince until she had
glimpsed the face of dona juliana
then after seeing desmond descend
into the sea she realized that some-
thing similar to her own position must
obtain aboard the other craft but
where had the man gone  in agonized
suspense she sat listening waiting not
knowing what to expect or hope or fear

  she knew very well that despite the
arguments of law and order queer
things did happen at sea even in these
prosaic days she knew that despite
scoffers actual piracy of the old school
still turned up from time to time she
knew that in such a combination of
circumstances as now obtained anything
was possible so she waited listening

  nothing happened at the stem
window of the schooner she saw anx-
ious faces appear and vanish quickly
as though fearful of being noted the
rope had been drawn up from the
swashing waves below came no hail
no voice the minutes dragged fear-
fully up above there was some hitch
in the work the manchus were break-
ing out some of their cargo preparing
to transship the opium some had al-
ready gone to the schooner rosemonde
waited her nerves pricking then sud-
denly came a sound at her door her
pistol wavered up only to halt

  whos there she called softly
speak quickly

  she had spoken in french and now
the answer came back to her-a cau-
tious flood of abominable soldier
brogue mixed with english ejacula-
tions and asides

  une moment siou plait-mule
polochons what the divil is this rope
doin on the door now a moment
madame have no fear and i shall be
with you-damnation light on the yel-
low divils for if they catch me here
im gone-rien a craindre bel ange-
who in hell did be layin the stuff here
-ne vous effrayez done-

  rosemonde unlocked the door a
the opium ship



moment afterward it burst open as des-
mond concluded his removal of the bar-
ricade the two stood there gazing
at each other

  oh murmured desmond thinking
that she spoke only french and to
think o me in me underwear poor
divii r

  a ripple of laughter crossed the fea-
tures of rosemonde to his dismay des-
mond realized that she spoke not
french alone but english

  theres a burberry in the cabin to
the right she said demurely

  desmond turned and vanished for
the moment he had forgotten the dan-
gerous features of the situation meet-
ing this amazing woman whom he had
never before seen was like a flash of
lightning in the night he was back
in a moment with the long rainproof
cloaking him as he entered her cabin
and closed the door he bowed to her
with his fine courtesy

 my name is desmond madame
gerald desmond late of the royal
air corps i came over thinking i
might be of service to you if so pray
consider me at your command 

  how did you get aboard here
she demanded remembering that ago-
nized wait

  faith i floated around to the stem
came up the misbegotten rudder post
and in an open window and started to
find you desmond smiled it was
takin a bit for granted maybe but
thats a habit i have-

  oh misericorde gasped the girl
suddenly as remembrance flooded upon
her i-i-monsieur i am very silly

  desmond caught her as she swayed
he thought she would faint but she
recovered herself with a word of pro-
test the reaction had seized her vio-
lently

  leaving her for the moment des-
mond cautiously placed himself at the
port overhead the work was on full

swing and he saw a huge bale being
hauled aboard the san gregorio at
the stern window of the schooner he
had a glimpse of osullivans face and
waved his hand then he withdrew
fearful lest he be seen and turned again
to rosemonde

  i dont know whats troubling you
madame he said gravely but from
the bullet holes in the door yonder
and various indications of activity
there seems to have been a ruction if
ye have no objections to outlining the
general action it might be a good thing
to speak up for theres the storm cornin
back on us and work to be done
rosemonde looked at him smiling
bravely yet with misty eyes

  oh v she said i am so glad to
meet a man like you 

  i hope yell never be sorry for it
said desmond gallantly youre
french i take it

  i am an american she said at

least-

  thus she told him her story and
the story of the chang van

  desmond listened without comment
his eyes hardening a little as she came
to the final threat of prince chan and
when she had finished after sketching
very briefly her own part in the ad-
venture desmond gave her a rapid
survey f the situation aboard the
sch

  and now he added with a wry
smile ive put me foot in it when
i left yonder i told em to be out on
deck and start fighting if they heard
any shooting over here and it was a
fool order sixteen of those chinamen
eh to say nothin of arevalo and
his gang poor osullivan and the
skipper would be wiped out o sight
without me there to guide em

  but if you were there queried
rosemonde breathless

  ah now its talkin you are sweet
jewel desmond started up can
you swim


the opium ship

  a little yes but i cannot swim back
to your ship

  ye dont have to desmonds eyes
were blazing now alight with inspira
tion til be gone a few minutes get
jready any little things ye may want to
take along and ill see to the rest
thunder o finn why didnt i think
of it before all this time wasted
and opium pourin into the schooner
like water keep away from the win-
dow like a good girl and trust me to
do the rest

  thus speaking desmond paused not
for questions but vanished into the pas-
sage outside

  rosemonde still gasping over his
suddenness got together a few personal
effects she realized that desmond had
come aboard unseen by any that his
presence here was quite unsuspected
by the manchus he therefore possessed
an advantage in whatever scheme he
might attempt but she could see no
hope for them both to get aboard the
schooner

  she was ready and now waited at
the doorway listening for some alarm
she had determined not to let this man
do battle by himself at the first shot
she would sally forth to aid him and
yet he had said that there must be no
shooting what could he be doing
she could hear nothing except a tram-
pling of feet on the deck above and
the chattering voices of the men at
work by this time she realized there
must have gone aboard the san gre-
gorio a huge amount of opium-huge
in value that is its bulk would not
be great

  a step in the passage and she looked
out her automatic lifting but it was
desmond whistling under his breath
and seeming quite unimpressed by his
situation he laughed gayly as she
stepped aside to let him enter and
picked up one of the coils of rope that
had barricaded the door from the out-
side

  well have need of this likely he
observed flinging it into the cabin with
an effort now theres nothing tp do
except to lock the door and await
events luckily were on the starboard
side itll bring us dose under the stern
o the schooner

  what will demanded rosemonde
staring at him what have you done
how can we get to the schooner
desmond of a sudden was aware of
a great beauty in her brown eyes-not
what other men might call beauty per-
haps but the true symmetry of all re-
lation between physical and spiritual
and mental he felt abashed and put
to confusion before her grave gaze as
though he were less than the dust be-
low her feet it came upon him that she
held within her something very far and
high something untouched and unhurt

by the world-

  ua mhuxrev he muttered confused
by his own dazed sensation what
did ye say your name was-rose-
monde  ah its a leanhaunshee ye are
a fairy mistress its the inspiration
of a poet that looks out of your eyes
rosemonde but what was it you were
askin me

  she gazed at him curiously half smil-
ing at his words yet wondering at him

 how can we get aboard the
schooner dream man  she said for
you are a man out of a dream if there
ever was one

  desmond laughed aloud at her mood
throw the rope out of the window
and slide down well be alongside the
schooner presently my friends yon-
der will pick us up

  oh and how shall we be along-
side the schooner

  when these chinese divils wake up
to whats below theyll get aboard to
save their lives wont they

  she frowned puzzled by his words
  please tell me what youve done

how-

  oh i forgot i fiadnt explained to
the opium ship



ye said desmond hastily well its
very simple i noticed there was only
one small boat aboard this elegant ship
and that boat was stowed plumb in the
stern so i found me way aft every-
body bein up on deck and built an
excellent little fire where the wind will

fan it up-

  she started a fire you set fire
to the ship

  of course havent i been trying
to tell you about it all this while 
this ship is afire-now

  desmond waved his hand gayly
the sweetest fire you ever saw rose-
monde theyll not discover it for
another five minutes and then itll be
over the stern and sweepin the lee side
-which is not this side-and the yellow
boys will shout for help the schooner
will drop back to take em aboard and
well go aboard likewise only the other
way there now its put me out o

breath talkin so much-

  rosemonde sank on her berth facing
him an excited laugher shaking her

  umon dieu what a man she mur-
mured but what if we do not get
alongside the schooner

  then retorted desmond coolly
were out of luck thats all but ive
never been out o luck in me life no
not even in manila i can see plainly
now that my getting shanghaied was
the biggest stroke of luck ever happened
to me

  why she ventured incautiously
because ive met you fairy mis-
tress 

  bah do you talk this way to all
women 

  pm afraid i do rosemonde said
desmond but now unsmiling yet
this time its from me heart

  she met his gaze steadily there
was a moment of silence

  an absurd situation-this man clad
in underwear and a raincoat talking
thus to such a woman at their first
meeting yet something in desmonds

personality lifted his words into ear-
nest conviction dispelled all thought
of the situation rosemonde read
strange deep things in those blue eyes
of his and a slow tide of color rose
into her face when she spoke it was
in abrupt reversion to the prior sub-
ject

  what if they put out the fire
they cant put out two at once
theyve not men enough

 two you have-

  yes i started another one as far
forard as i could get its blazin
merrily by this time lets pray theyll

discover it soon enough-

  a sudden yelping of voices answered
him held him tense

  feet pounded the deck above
through the open window came the
sound of shrill cries a babel of shouts
and orders aboard the steamer des-
mond could see the crew rushing from
their work into the stem he lifted
his automatic toward arevalo then
slowly lowered it shaking his head re-
gretfully one shot might spoil all
his scheme

  they are coming-for me said
rosemonde quietly

  desmond swung about to the door
which was now locked a trampling of
feet was in the passage outside the
door shivered and banged to the urge
of hands and the voice of prince chan
shrilled excitedly

  madame the ship is on fire-
come quickly

  to the inquiring eyes of rosemonde
desmond shook his head and she kept
silent the manchu flung himself
against the door and again but he
could not prevail a burst of wild
chatterings summoned him away and
at the same instant a curl of smoke
came in beneath the door

  hes gone said desmond they
need him up above and the smoke is
thick outside now for the schooner
fairy mistress-


the opium ship

  an exclamation of delight broke
from him as he gained the window
at the stern of the schooner were clus-
tered her crew hauling in on the cables
her lines had been slacked off and
with flapping canvas she was falling
back while the junk surged ahead at
the stem windows appeared canaughan
and osullivan staring at the junk
desmond made them a sign and tossed
out the end of the line which he had
prepared they would understand
soon enough

  already the roar of flames had
drowned everything from hearing
desmond swept an eye at the sky and
was not reassured sea and heavens
were dead and dull to the sight and
the waves were heaving with an omi-
nous glassy smoothness

  be careful cried rosemonde
catching desmonds arm the ships
are coming together

  he nodded as he had figured are-
valo or rather balderson who was
in practical command of the schooner
was about to take off prince chan and
the manchus hope of saving the
chang yan had been abandoned but
the san gregorio could be laid athwart
her bows long enough for the chinese
to get aboard the schooner

  into the water with you rose-
monde  said desmond at the right in-
stant theyll never notice us now
arevalo and his crowd are too con-
cerned about getting the yellow men
safely off ill be right after you

  rosemonde asked no questions but
came to the window smoke was drift-
ing past now a cloud of yellowish-gray
fumes choking and obscuring every-
thing almost blindly the girl forced
herself outward and plunged

  desmond followed her to the win-
dow seeing as he did so that canaughan
was lowering the line from the stern
window of the schooner but at that
instant the scream of a man came from
outside the cabin desmond remem-

bered the man whom he had wounded
the man who must burn to death

  without hesitation he turned about
unlocked the door and staggered into
the smoke reek he found his man
still wildly screaming and dragged him
back to safety the manchu had been
shot through the shoulder desmond
heaved him through the window bodily
then followed him as quickly as might
be when he plunged into the water
and came up to the surface the yellow
man was frenziedly shouting and flurry-
ing a dozen feet distant

  desmond struck out for the schoon-
ers stem where he saw rosemonde
at the rope before he reached her
side canaughan and osullivan were
hauling her up he had a glimpse
too of juliana aiding them then he
was under the stem and the line
dropped down over his hand

  twenty minutes later a foaming line
of hissing water struck the schooner
and the blazing pyre that had been the
chang yan was swallowed up in the
vague horizon of the hurricane which
had circled back upon its prey the
schooner drove staggering into the
west

chapter viii

ashore

daracel island is one of many
forgotten shoals that dot the
china sea between the philippines and
the mainland uninhabited far from
the steamer lanes paracel island lies
in the azure sea neglected of men vis-
ited only by the occasional beche-de-
mer fishers who probe the long reefs
and shoals for the sea slugs

  there was no azure sea around par-
acel however when the san gregorio
struck there was but a wild swelter
of foam in the night and the huge seas
lifted the schooner over the outer reef
dropped her in the lagoon and drove
the opium ship



her on the inner reef before the men
aboard her realized their danger

  this came in the night following the
meeting with the junk desmond and
his friends securely battened below
had been unable either to reach the
deck or to attempt the recovery of the
ship this latter indeed desmond ad-
mitted to be impossible for the present
for arevalo had been reenforced by
the manchus and the chance had been
lost

  juliana and rosemonde had retired
to the formers cabin and captain
canaughan was growling at desmond
when the crash came the two were
flung on top of osullivan in the cor-
ner the ship struck again and this
time remained steady although with a
sharp list to port

  what followed was tragically brief
and sudden the second shock had
hurled desmond headlong against a
stanchion dazing and stunning him the
lamp slung in gimbals had been shat-
tered fortunately without the oil
catching fire in the darkness there
came a rending smash at the door and
at the same time juliana and rose-
monde had come hastily from their
cabin

  desmond roused to a scream from
juliana followed by the bursting crash
of a shot the trampling of feet a roar
of voices he recognized that instantly
the ship had struck arevalo must have
led his forces below to find juliana
there came another shot a bellow in
the voice of canaughan and a rushing
whirl of bodies the cabin was in
blind confusion an uproar of oaths
and screams filled the place

  finding a match desmond scratched
it before the flame flared up a mass
of bodies swirled into him extinguished
the light fingers groped at his throat
then to his great satisfaction desmond
found himself at grips with a tangible
antagonist from somewhere rang out
a third shot by the quick explosion

desmond recognized the snarling fea-
tures of arevalo pressed close upon
him

  thunder o finn he cried out his
voice lost amid the din now me
bucko-

  merciless he drew the murderer to
him heard arevalo shriek in his ear
sank his hands in the mans neck cords
over the uproar pierced the great voice
of balderson but desmond heeded
nothing of what was passing around
him a groaning man fell against the
two knocked them against the wall

  arevalo screamed again the scream
ending suddenly as desmond lifted and
dashed him into the wall of the ship
the half-breeds grip tightened con-
vulsively  again desmond sent him
crashing against a stanchion this
time the clutching hands were loosened
in death arevalo relaxed shuddering
and was dead before desmond could
drop him

  the schooner seemed suddenly quiet
no seas were beating against her
broken hull-the lagoon protected her
the tumult in the cabin had hushed
but from the deck above was sounding
a rush of feet and storm of voices
desmond fishing in his pocket for a
match realized that the men had de-
parted

  mr desmond came a voice

  that you rosemonde t he re-
turned ah heres a match-

  the light flared up he saw rose-
monde standing in the doorway of the
inner cabin a pistol in her hand osul-
livan was staggering to his feet the
match died suddenly

  divil take it rosemonde will you
get me the lamp from your cabin
thanks

  he found another match and lighted
it rosemonde joined him a moment
later with the lamp lighting this
desmond gave it to her to hold then
turned

  come here cried out the fiddler


the opium ship

bending over a dark shape besides
arevalo there were two other bodies
twisted in death rosemonde had shot
well but it was not above these that
osullivant knelt

  canaughan  exclaimed desmond
sharply lifting the head of the skipper
the latter opened his eyes and smiled
grimly

  desmond-i take back what i said
about-papists-aye man twas but
said to-plague ye a bit-look out for
-miss juliana-

  the skipper sighed and relaxed
mute osullivan pointed to a ragged
knife wound below the throat through
which the sturdy ulstermans life had
fled desmond leaped up

  juliana where is she rose-
monde 

  the hazel eyes black in the lamp-
light dilated ah they must have
taken-

  whirling desmond ran for the deck
curses on his lips as he ran he
gripped out his automatic which all
this while had lain under his arm the
hatchway was open

  he realized now that arevalo see-
ing the ship lost had left the chinese
to get out the boats while he flung
his men below in an effort to take
juliana from her haven in the cabins
arevalo had paid for this work-but
juliana was gone

  desmond darted up the ladder and
threw himself out into the gusty black-
ness of the night the deck slanted
sharply to port but the ship seeemed
secure enough unable to see any de-
tails of what was around him desmond
ran forward he met no one but an
instant later he saw a dark shape
whirled away from the bows vanishing
in the night the last boat had gone

  putting his weapon away desmond
went the bounds of the deck marveling
that despite the ferocity of the wind
there was little spray flying from the
absence of seas however he deduced

that the ship must lie within some reef
circle the surrounding darkness was
quite impenetrable and he knew that
he must wait until morning to define
the position the foremast had gone
when the ship struck and had smashed
one of the boats to flinders the re-
maining boats were gone

  desmond whistling between his
teeth returned to the after hatchway
there osullivan encountered him

  gone well praise be ye got are-
valo sir are we sinkm

  no we seem safe enough michael
terence hurt



  were all right sir poor canau-
ghan its gone he is-

  none o that me lad said des-
mond well have more grieving to
do before were out o this im think-
ing in the lee o the deck i could
hear breakers so were ashore some-
where you and i must stand watch
an watch this night and spend the
time gettin canaughan sewed up for
decent burial in the morning let the
lady sleep

  he passed below and rejoined rose-
monde shaking his head in response
to her glance of inquiry

  shes gone rosemonde but shes
in no danger when they find that
arevalo hasnt come ashore theyll have
ifo object in keeping juliana a prisoner
where we are i dont know but weve
run smack ashore and are safe for the
present since were apt to be busy
in the mornin youd better take my
advice and get some sleep

  sleep repeated rosemonde star-
ing at him after what has just hap-
pened - 

  desmond sh nigged his shoulders
whats done is done rosemonde
you must make yourself sleep me lady
things are goin to happen to-morrow
and well need the benefit o your brain
when prince chan and balderson come
back

  you think theyll come back
the opium ship



  yes isnt there a million dollars
worth of opium more or less aboard
here you wait and see to-morrow
well need our heads

  rosemonde indicated the bodies on
the cabin floor and-these

  well take care of them

  she said no more but turned about
and closed the door desmond looked
at osullivan and grimaced

  theres a woman for ye michael
terence now turn in an get a bit
o sleep

  the fiddler his long black hair fly-
ing about his pinched features directed
a long look at the body of the skipper
then without a word flung himself into
a bunk

  desmond was saddened more than
he cared to admit by the death of the
skipper in the short time he had
known captain canaughan he had
found deep store of sturdy character
in the ulsterman and much to admire
the mans death was untimely it
formed one of those strangely uncom-
pleted things which go to make up life
-a race half run a skein left all at
loose ends

  there must be a new alignment now
that arevalo was gone reflected des-
mond of the schooners original com-
plement three men were left with bal-
derson the yellow cook would have
joined the manchus placing about fif-
teen men under prince chanfifteen
yellow four white and the prince
would command them of course bal-
derson would defer to him

 the two of us and rosemonde
against em thought desmond that
is if they elect to fight well have
to wait and see whatll turn up eh
there are chances for anything with
that gang

  morning broke a gray storm-filled
morning with shreds of misty scud
carrying across the wreck from the
outer reef desmond had relieved
osullivan an hour previously he

now stood in the bows regarding the
situation with no great delight

  the schooner had been lifted across
the outer barrier reef after striking
first and had been driven across the
lagoon upon a second shoal but a hun-
dred yards from the shore there
upon the white sand beach desmond
saw the two boats of the schooner no
men were in sight but the island was
thickly grown with brush and trees al-
most to the shore from his position
desmond could form little idea of its
size

  he went below wakened osullivan
and between them they got the body
of canaughan on deck the other
bodies had been thrown overboard dur-
ing the night finding that rosemonde
was awake and dressing desmond
waited until she joined them above
and then proceeded with the funeral

  the entire ship now being in their
possession desmond took charge of
the galley and soon had a steaming
breakfast ready they ate the meal in
the lee of the deck house to his
secret admiration desmond found that
rosemonde faced their unpleasant posi-
tion almost with unconcern seeming
anxious about juliana rather than her-
self

  you think dona juliana is in no
danger then  she inquired

  not a bit said desmond cheerfully
arevalo was her chief peril prince
chan made threats against you yes
but hes the type to realize at this junc-
ture that if he stops to amuse himself
with the ladies he loses everything
hell want to get clear with the opium
thats all you and juliana have little
to fear from him-as things stand
now

  ah then there is something to
fear queried rosemonde calmly

  there may be thunder o finn
if i was a mohammedan now id
carry off the both o you ladies  and
desmond laughed gayly upon me


the opium ship

soul rosemonde where would ever a
man again find two such women 

  she looked at him no warmth in her
eyes juliana spoke a good deal of
you last night

  tm glad o that returned desmond
complacently did she increase your
good opinion of me fairy mistress
naturally she did you are to be
congratulated on your conquest she
is a fine girl

  ah desmond looked quickly at
her whats that again conquest
did you say 

  rosemonde met his gaze very stead-
ily my dear mr desmond-

  thunder o finn dont be using that
tone o voice to me exclaimed des-
mond look here now its true
as im a living man that ive never said
a word of love to any woman but your-
self rosemonde and never will i

  a flush as it were of anger flooded
into her cheeks but her hazel eyes did
not waver from his in their depths
desmond read strange things and sud-
den fear came upon him what the
devil had he said to juliana after all
nothing extremely personal he was
sure of that much nothing very serious
or meant to be taken seriously none
the less he suddenly perceived shoals
and dangers ahead

  boat cornin out cried osullivan
at this juncture

  desmond leaped up glad of the in-
tervention

  one of the boats was being shoved
out by half a dozen men desmond
recognized them for manchus the
second boat was likewise being rolled
down the sand but this one by four
only-balderson and his three mates

  -that is prince chan jumping into
the stem said rosemonde

  desmond nodded and turned to the
fiddler

  michael terence me lad will you
be getting up into the stern with your

gun now dont fire until ye get the
word from me however

  fight them off asked rosemonde
without alarm

  i hope not desmond squinted at
the two boats now leaving the shore
with a perplexed twinkle in his eye
therell be no fighting i hope still
ye can never tell and it looks queer
how theyre coming separate that way
ahoy theref what dye want
balderson rowing an oar with his
mates turned and glanced over his
shoulder even his great voice could
not be distinguished against the wind
however and desmond made a gesture
beckoning on the boats they drew
closer converging to within fifty feet
of the schooner when prince chan
stood up and lifted his hands to his
mouth

 we are unarmed may t come
aboard 

  come ahead responded desmond
then balderson likewise shouted

  me too desmond  huh  dont
trust the chink y

  come ahead and desmond smiled
rosemonde touched his arm frowning
a little

  what does it mean then

  it means theres trouble in their
camp and desmond laughed into her
eyes praise be well manage things
yet keep your gun on the manchus
ill watch the white men

  if youre willing to trust them all

  weapon in hand desmond watched
the two boats as they drew in toward
the lowered port rail of the schooner
by the glances exchanged between the
two craft he was convinced that trou-
ble had arisen what that trouble could
be he was not aware

  balderson and prince chan come
aboard he said when the two boats
were below if another man moves in
either boat we shoot

  there was plenty of water over the
the opium ship



reef to float the boats and as they	has informed us of your activities yes-

swung in the prince and balderson	terday you see mr desmond i do

stood up and clambered over the rail	not underrate your ability and not only

beyond making fast with hooks the	shall i cancel the debt i owe you but

other men obeyed desmonds mandate	you shall be at liberty to depart wher

  good morning madame burley	ever you desire

said tbe prince in french with a bow	oh said desmond you want us

to rosemonde rtthis is mr des-	to vacate the schooner no doubt

mond  i am glad to meet you sir	the prince bowed in silent assent

  balderson flung him a suspicious	desmond turned to balderson

glance the giant his tangle of hair	well whats your proposition
and beard floating over his shoulders  mr mutineer

in the wind bit from a plug of tobacco	baldersons eyes were like blue ice

and expectorated over the side	is arevalo dead

  none o that chatter now he re-	dead and buried returned des-

marked cards on the table all	mond cheerfully

hands	then the chest belongs to us cause

  desmond glanced from one to the	we were partners with arevalo in buyin

to be continued

our daily work
the study of our daily work is one of the most entrancing things i know about

     especially as the majority of people take it as a matter of course

    do not neglect the most important part of the day study carefully the
conditions of your means of living does your job or position profit you men-
tally as well as physically or financially all these points must be weighed in
the scales and if one is found wanting you should make a change

     did you ever realize that a mental house-cleaning is an excellent thing now
and then you go on living month after month with the same emotions and
identical thoughts did it ever occur to you to clear them out and begin anew

    some of these mental houses i meet are so dirty so careworn so old-
fashioned that i know nothing modem or worth while could gain an entrance
a grouchy host would close the door in a new ideas face

    think of that

    about once a year it will pay you to open all the windows of your mental
house scrub the floors throw away the old junk and buy afresh and paint the
decaying woodwork the sunlight will do you good

               j thought that when i struck
                  him down

                 why that would be the end
                 of one who stole my love away

                   that false betraying friend

                  i gave him no time for a prayer

                 and no space for a priest   

                  i flung him over in the moat
                  to make the fishes feast

                 yet even as i turned away

                 and thought now all is well   

                  a night thing sent one doleful cry
                  like a mans voice from hell

                  they searched for many torch-lit nights
                  for many a windy day

                  till a peasant said hed seen him go
                  as he had ridden away
foil load i laughed    but when i saw
the stable open wide

i feared the dead who would not die

his horse was not inside

then came my woman he had won

saying his ring of worth

he took last night    behold no more
it holds my fingers girth

oh worse than death the look he gave
and none the words he said
when the slain man returned one night
and stood beside my bed

i sent for the sad gray silent priest

and as he harkrd to me

horror rose in his face like dawn
over a still gray sea

alas alas ive learned too late

now that my days are sped

that strike with daggers all you may

ttie dead will not lie dead   

and i hear them building all day long
and far into the night
a tall thing with a dangling rope
upon a sky-black height
a voice

tod robbins

it is night in the library the lights
are extinguished every one has
gone to bed i am sitting before
toy desk writing it is perfectly safe
if the scratch of the pen is heard if
the inmates of the house should sud-
denly open the door and turn on the
lights they would see nothing-only
the pen lying beside the inkwell the
window is open and when i have fin-
ished i will float out into the street

  i have been dead a week and now
my body lies underground in a plain
black conffin when i saw this coffin
lowered into the earth it reminded me
of a black boat sinking beneath the
surface of the water suddenly i wept
to see all those hard avaricious faces
about the grave i was my only
mourner

  all my life i have been toiling like
a bee so that others might plunder my
hive these others have it now and
they are happy they no longer wish
i were dead that is a satisfaction
they think that i am safe underground
and yet they profess to be christians

  i have a nephew who is a fat greedy
fellow he goes about with a stupid
expression that is because he is cun-
ning i dislike him so ive always
kept him near me it is better to have
a bee in front than behind

  often this nephew has said to ine
uncle you are immensely wealthy
are you not and i would always
answer modestly that all depends
a few millions perhaps

  at these times his round wet mouth
would open slightly and his small
sleepy eyes would become covered with
a kind of film he is a very greedy
fellow but i was not as wealthy as
he imagined in fact i was not wealthy
at all

  of late i have been thinking deeply
an idea has come which pleases me
my nephew is a very fat and lazy man
when he sits down on a chair he gives
little animal grunts of satisfaction
when he comes upstairs with his candle
the light flickers as he breathes upon
it he is so lazy that i would like to
see him work-work very hard this
a voice from beyond

s

is what i would like to see him do i
would like to see him go out into the
garden back of the house the garden
which is progressing so nicely and dig
and dig with his spade into the soft
ground how the perspiration would
roll into his eyes how the veins on his
forehead would bulge out and how his
pale plump hands would tremble

  my nephew is a spiritualist once a
month he goes to a seance in the neigh-
borhood last night i heard him mut-
ter that old devil had more money
than we found i stood right beside
him and i smiled

  perhaps the next time that he goes
to the seance i shall have a talk with
him perhaps i shall say nephew
under the tree in the garden where you
have planted your vegetables is an old
trunk filled with money-money which

i hid there years ago on a full moon
dig where the shadow of the topmost
branch falls

  and then my nephew will steal out
of the house at the dead of night and
will dig in this garden where the tiny
plants are sprouting up and he will
sweat and swear and throw the earth
about but i will float calmly in the air
above him and watch and laugh-laugh
very silently so as not to disturb the
singing of the breeze and there will
be nothing at the bottom of that hole
-nothing then he will try again in a
different spot and still there will be
nothing and he will go on sweating
swearing and digging till this little gar-
den will be no garden

  and all this time i will be laughing
silently for this fat nephew of mine is
a very lazy man

a n irishman was careless enough to let his priest see him coming out of a hotel

i am two men

     dont smile and say more
jekyll-hyde stuff nothing of
the kind i am serious and with all
solemnity repeat i am two men

  my inexplicable double-ego did not
manifest itself until a few months ago
were another to tell me what i now am
asserting as a fact i like you might
disbelieve but i actually can sub-
stantiate all my statements with docu-
ments as you shall see

  i live wide awake twenty-four hours
each day half the time in one place and
half the time some eight thousand miles
sway the difference in time here in
new york and at the antipodes makes
each existence a daylight experience
i see little of night except under rare
circumstances of late retiring which

correspondingly affects either of my en-
tities and causes late awakening

  please do not misunderstand me i
am not mad nor am i silly i am baf-
fled  so are my advisers

  mine positively is a plural existence
-not a dual existence in the jekyll-
hyde sense one body and two
minds

   have hvo bodies and two minds

  having stated this fact you can see
that i shall not jekyll-hyde you in this
memoir

  i do not disappear at intervals
neither is one of my natures murder-
ous and the other kindly my disposi-
tions-i must pluralize-are analoguos
i positively am aware of each person-
ality my nature in each is the same
my facial and bodily characteristics are
tales of the double man



exactly duplicate in both bodies-eight
thousand miles apart my environ-
ments and experiences however neces-
sarily are different

   it is difficult to explain exactly what
i mean to convey you must step lively
to keep pace with my suddenly varied
occult-physical or physical-occult mani-
festations else you shall not compre-
hend i know this concentration is
necessary because i already have en-
deavored in vain to convince my two
physicians-one in each environment-
of my plural existence each ascribes
my experiences to my nerves i
know they are at fault in their diagno-
ses

  when-as william gray-i tell my
physician doctor marvin porter in
new york city that as i fall asleep
there i wake eight thousand miles
away in cape town british south
africa and become arthur wadleigh

crepit does it  how can you explain

inter-transmigratory experiences i had
not known the name of the president
of the london ivory company but
i have the letter and attach it to this
document together with other letters
and proofs of my plurality this in
case any harm should befall me and i
be considered insane

  again as arthur wadleigh in cape
town on january   i received
from william gray in new york this
interesting communication

                 no l wall street

          new york december  
arthur wadleigh esq manager the lon-
don ivory company cape town britialt
south africa

  my dear mr wadleigh  i am ex-
tremely anxious to clarify a mystery which i
hesitate to explain for fear i shall open my-
self to your doubting my sanity in brief
i find myself become yourself the
moment i fall asleep vice versa as your-
self i become myself when i fall asleep
in cape town in fact in writing to you
i believe i am writing to myself i shall
not go into further details until i learn
whether i shall have earned your sympathy
in my trouble sufficiently to have you ac-
cede to a request i now shall make i in-
close my photograph and ask you in re-
turn to send me yours this may be a
means of ending what my physician terms a
hallucination he may be correct but my
experiences are so real that i believe he errs
needless to say i hope i am wrong your


tales of the double man

generous courtesy will be deeply appreciated
by yours most respectfully

william gray

  as i read this letter and scrutinized
grays photograph i saw the exact pre-
sentment of myself arthur wadleigh
i compared my own photo with that
of gray no twins ever were such
duplicates

  in new york as william gray on
february th  i opened this
letter from wadleigh

offices of the london ivory company

cape town b s a january  
william gray esq no  wall street

  new york city u s a

  my dear mr gray your communica-
tion has astounded me inasmuch as i also
have experienced somewhat the same inex-
plicable plural life as you my physician also
says i am subject to hallucinations and need
a rest i agree with him concerning the rest
but not concerning the hallucinations i in-
close my photo but might just as well have
returned your own instead inasmuch as
both faces are exactly alike even the mole
on the right cheek near the ear is duplicated
it is very strange both photos show the
mole clearly you can compare them and
see for yourself i also shall add for your
further information because the photo cannot
convey these facts that i am five feet nine
inches tall and stocky in build i have dark-
brown hair slightly wavy my eyes are blue
and i have a wart on my left thumb near the
nail i have been profoundly disturbed
and like yourself was about to communicate
with you in similar vein when i received your
letter

  like you i feel that in writing to you i
am writing to myself i dare write no
more lest should this letter be seen by eyes
other than yours or mine i be adjudged a
lunatic the remarkable coincidence in our
photographs has increased my perplexity
rather than diminished it in a business way
i shall be happy to serve you and meet your
commands in every way possible yours most
respectfully	arthur wadleigh

  scrutinizing wadleighs portrait i
was amazed at the exact resemblance to
that of myself william gray the
mole on the right cheek near ihe ear
completed the verisimilitude i also
liave dark hair and blue eyes i also

have a wart on my left thumb near the
nail i also am five feet nine inches tall
i also am stockily built it seems so
unbelievable that i almost doubt my
senses how much more unbelievable
must these facts seem to others yet
they are true

  needless to say i could not continue
in this maze so as william gray i
decided to leave new york for cape
town british south africa to have
a talk with wadleigh

  as wadleigh i simultaneously left
cape town british south africa for
new york to have a talk with gray
whenever as gray i fell asleep on the
steamship for cape town i immedi-
ately awakened as wadleigh on the
steamship bound for new york con-
versely as wadleigh on the steamship
for new york i would fall asleep to
awaken immediately as gray on the
steamship bound for cape town it
was most strange

  such a harrowing experience will
shatter any mans nerves it prostrated
me as gray in my trip to cape town
it prostrated me as wadleigh in my
trip to new york

  in both instances complete uncon-
sciousness-god-given as it were-
gave me opportunity to rest-both as
gray and as wadleigh but im-
mediately upon my plural convales-
cence the same dread double existence
recommenced how can you explain
it

  when i as gray landed in cape
town and sought the offices of arthur
wadleigh i was greeted as mr wad-
leigh all my expostulations explana-
tions and documents could not convince
mr wadleighs associates that i was
gray

  when i as wadleigh landed in new
york and sought the offices of william
gray in wall street i was greeted as
mr gray here also expostulations
and evidence could not convince mr
tales of the double man



grays associates that i was mr wad-
leigh

  in each instance however by press-
ing my claims and assertions i was able
to learn of the others departure for a
long trip but in each instance my
associates in the antipodal cities be-
lieved i had returned sooner than ex-
pected

  in each instance distracted by this
dread contretemps i returned home-
as gray to new york-as wadleigh to
cape town

 human endurance must succumb
eventually to such fatal unresting
existences because of this fear i have
written my peculiar double history no
astral body projection theory can ex-
plain the enigma neither is telepathy
involved in my experience but i
know that the sleep i obtain in each
existence lacks the invigorating rest
bestowed by normal slumbers

  when not long since i gazed at my
reflection-that of william gray-in
my office mirror in new york i was
pale and haggard my eyes were blood-
shot and my hair was slightly streaked
with white strands

  when falling asleep i awakened as
wadleigh in cape town and gazed at
my reflection in the glass i was pale
and haggard my eyes were bloodshot
and my hair was slightly streaked with
white strands

  after to-day i shall write no more

for i william gray prosaic stock-
broker in wall street unable longer
to bear this dread visitation of plurality
of soul and body have begun to-day
the use of morphine to bring some re-
lief likewise as arthur wadleigh in
cape town i have sought morphine
as a means to forgetfulness i can get
no rest otherwise

  where shall it end why have i
been cursed in this manner i have
been a clean-living honorable man-
both as gray and wadleigh

 i welcome the lethe morphine
brings me

  but-what shall be the climax i
dread to think of it

  editors note mr william gray
the new york stockbroker was this
day taken to the bellevue hospital
for the insane he is not expected to
live more than a few days unless some
sudden occult relief is provided medi-
cines are valueless

from the

jby

 don mark lemon

winter came and covered it
with a white all-concealing
blanket of snow spring came
the snow melted and innumerable tiny
shoots of green lifted up their heads
and sparkled each with its drops of
living dew then came summer and a
rank brier sown by the hand of the
wind broke from the unholy sod and
flaunted its blood-red corolla un-
abashed

  he came at night and rooted up the
stalk trampling upon it as if it were
a conscious thing for to his guilty soul
the brier seemed to shout to heaven
telling of what was hidden at its roots
the blood-red juice of the crushed
weed stained his hands and his cloth-
ing as that night seven months before
his hands and clothing had been stained
with the blood of a murdered man

  three weeks later a second brier
like a red tongue protruding from the
earth flaunted its head where the first
bad stood again he came at night and
uprooted the weed

  curse it he cried they will see
it here and come and dig it up and
find the thing at its roots fool that
i didnt bury him deeper with a
heel of iron he ground the offending
weed into the earth then huried away

  no third brier lifted up its blood-red
corolla and as if blighted by the step
of the murderer the grass about the
spot withered and died and the guilty
man hugged himself with joy no one
would now search there no child would
visit the place for flowers no old
woman would dig the soil for healing
herbs

  but suddenly the grassless and flow-
erless earth began to babble things

  a lad passed that way one evening
and while delaying a moment to latch
his shoestring he heard a whispering
which seemed to come from the solid
ground beneath his feet greatly star-
tled he looked about and when the
whispering was repeated he did not
pause to snatch up his pail of berries
but fled headlong
the whispering from the ground



  reaching the lights of the village
and the security of his home the lad
was ashamed of his hurried flight and
said nothing of his adventure but
the following afternoon he persuaded
a companion to visit the locality where
the two blood-red briers had been up-
rooted and bend down a moment and
listen

  again came that uncanny whisper-
ing from the solid ground and the
second boy fled headlong

  what did you hear questioned the
first lad

  a kind of whispering the place
is haunted

  what did the whispering say

  i couldnt make out but it was
something awful lets run v

  the boys turned and fled but the
following day they brought a third
companion to authenticate the mysteri-
ous sounds which they had heard and
when this lad returned to the village
he told everywhere how he had heard
a human voice whispering from the
ground over in a far corner of peter
bates pasture

  he was called a frightened booby
and told to go home to his mother but
he persisted in his tale until a couple
of hangers-on at the village saloon went
out to learn what foundation it had
a half hour later this pair rushed into
the bar and called for liquor

  when they had swallowed a glass
each of spirits they told their stoiy
directed by the lad they had gone to
the far southeast corner of peter bates
pasture and bending down had lis-
tened suddenly there had come a
whispering from the solid ground

  a whispering gasped the assem-
bled idlers

  yes a sort of whispering sound
  what did it say

  we couldnt make out just what it
said word for word but it said some-
thing about it being murdered and
wanted us to let it out of there

  as the two men who were rather
white about the lips turned and called
for more drink a form burst upon the
assembly it was that of a man about
fifty years of age who in spite of his
rounded shoulders and slouching car-
riage was a giant in stature he was
hatless his gray hair was in great dis-
order while his face was black with
passion the man was peter bates

  what is this i hear about there be-
ing a whispering in my pasture he
cried speak you pack of meddling
fools or ill choke the truth out of
you

  encouraged by numbers and warmed
by the liquor he had drunk the bolder
of the two talebearers answered

  go listen for yourself peter bates
if you cant believe what an honest man
is saying go listen for yourself where
the boys showed us back of your pas-
ture by that piece of soapstone rock
at these words the face of peter
bates went ashen and he fell back as
before a well-directed physical blow
in a moment however he had recov-
ered his courage if not his temper

  youre a pack of fools he cried
a pack of meddling fools its a
scheme you have on foot to run down
the value of my pasture so that you
can get it cheap if i catch another
one of you crossing my land ill turn
my bulls on you and let them gore you
to death f so have a care have a care
shaking his clenched hands at the as-
sembled idlers he hurried out hatless
into the twilight

  a voice in the assembly spoke up
theres something gone wrong with
peter bates ever since wilson dis-
appeared last autumn and bates got
the mill he hasnt been the same man
not the same man echoed a dozen
voices hes changed entirely

  it was midnight when a form stole
from the house that stood cm the north-
west comer of bates pasture and cau-
tiously made its way toward the spot


the whisperwg from the ground

where the two rank briers had lately
flaunted their blood-red blossoms it
was the form of a powerful round-
shouldered man about fifty years of
age his face distorted with hate and
fear and horror peter bates had not
slept that night he had not gone to bed
at all what if there should be a whis-
pering in his pasture just by the piece
of soapstone merciful heavens what
if there should be

  from the house to the locality where
the whispering had been heard was
about a quarter of a mile and soon
the murderer had covered that distance
like one who sees on a lonely road
by night some dreadful shape and is
drawn on and on to touch that shape
and know the worst sp peter bates
was drawn to the spot where he had
buried the body of his murdered part-
ner

  a whispering from the ground
could it be  bah  those who had
rumored it were fools and he a greater
fool for accrediting them

  he came to the grave where he
paused and bent down and listened ior
the murdered blood to cry from the
ground then something snapped in
his head as out of the solid ground
came the whisper

  i am the murdered henry wilson
in gods name let me out of here

  as a man led forth to be hanged
sinks at the foot of the scaffold so
peter bates sank upon the earth and
the clammy fingers of horror began
to mold his features as if they were
plastic yellow clay he whispered
back to the voice then shrieking beat
the grave sod with his vein-knotted
hands or babbled in the utter weakness
of conscience-stricken horror

  suddenly from the concealment of
the trees and rock a score of silent
forms gathered and closed around him
so that when again he looked up he was
encircled by a wall of stern-faced men
he leaped to his feet and would have

cried out in his amazement and dread
had not one member of that ghostly
circle lifted his hand and commanded
hush

  for a moment a deep stillness pre-
vailed  then again was heard that whis-
pering from the ground  am the
murdered henry wilson in gods
name let me out of here

  peter bates sank to his knees dont
you hear it  he cried it is blood
crying from the ground blood
blood blood oh god are you all
spirits too am i gone mad  he
said i would he cursed me as he lay
dying there with my knife in his heart
and swore that i should go mad

  the wretched man lifted his clasped
hands in appeal there was a swift mo-
tion upon the part of one member of
the circle and a pair of handcuffs
linked the murderers wrists

  now bring the spades and set to
work said an authoritative voice

  five minutes later from the spot
where the two blood red briers had
been uprooted there was lifted the skel-
eton of a man when peter bates saw
the grisly thing he turned away his
face and when they came to him and
asked if he chose to confess that he
had murdered his former partner they
found the living man less than the dead
his reason was gone

  i am a detective said the authori-
tative voice and some weeks since
coming unseen upon the prisoner while
he was rooting a flower from this par-
ticular spot it flashed over me that he
had killed his missing partner and
buried the body here the following

night i revisited the scene and-

hand me a spade

  in a few minutes the detective had
unearthed a small oblong box and some
electric paraphernalia from beside the
soapstone this he held up for inspec-
tion

  gentlemen here is the ghost-a pho-
nograph i
it was a strange series of events that
brought us together in that god-
forsaken hole men drift around
through the tropics like lost souls in
hell it isnt considered good ethics
to question them closely either a lot
of them went out there to escape jus-
tice some joined the army and when
their enlistments were out decided to
remain others had been disappointed
in love and professed to be woman-
haters but as a general rule they
were good fellows now and then we
would run across a scoundrel it did
not take us long to find it out a few
nights at the club a stretch of work
some tense moment then if the poor
dog failed it ended the affair a few
days later a tramp schooner would melt
into the distance carrying a dejected be-
ing to another port it was not always
so easy to rid the place of their pres-
ences there was braxton for in-
stance but thats another story

  kennedy has always possessed a flair
for the mysterious the unseen in ad-
dition he was a good talker when

you dwell on the fact that we had been
marooned in mindanao over six
months with no possible hope of re-
turning and had been hard put to find
something which might amuse us you
will realize what kennedy stood for
not that he was such a jovial fellow
no one was less so the charm of
his personality lay rather in his com-
fortableness his manner of repose
we watched each other closely we
four and i am sure if one of us had
proven a coward it would have been
instantly discovered

  it wasnt an easy matter to try and
sleep when a thousand moros or so
beat their fiendish drums in religious
ecstasy through the long hot hours of
darkness nor was it a simple matter
to greet a column from the interior
bearing the remains of some american
slashed and shot to pieces when these
and a few other trifling matters are
taken into consideration it will be seen
how comparatively easy it might have
been for us to drift into a laxity of
spirit and will


the dead book

  kennedy kept us interested from the
very first day as it happened he was
the head of an engineering party that
had built some sort of a plant the year
before he was waiting for orders
from manila he expected to have
another proposition on his hands by
the end of that summer we didnt
know much about his past life from
his conversation  gathered that he had
been educated decently no more and
was a reader of wide range with a
tremendous store of experiences he
had delved into eastern thought and
european philosophy holding to his
original opinions in spite of argument
and despising dogmatic conceptions of
any kind it is a bit dangerous to be
an original thinker when you are ban-
ished to a distant part of the world
i have seen them-crumple like burned
paper in the silence those thinkers
but kennedy had a level head

  youve got to watch yourself he
would say out here its blamed easy
to concentrate on what youve lost i
tried it for a while the chief looked
me over and said that if i didnt let
the booze alone and stop getting off
into a comer by myself hed send me
home as a failure that set my
thoughts in motion i didnt repeat a
mans philosophy out here has got to
be objective not subjective what he
needs is plenty to do and little to think
about dont you remember carson
fie came here when i did there
wasnt a finer fellow in the world he
once told me that he expected to make
a fortune and return to the states he
didnt say anything more but we
learned later that he was engaged i
found her picture in his room after-
ward then we had to wait for some
machinery that came all o k but
it proved the usual dead stuff we
had to order again by that time car-
son began to worry we didnt like
to say anything we kept a close
watch months passed we realized

that unless something happened the
game was up it did fred bimey
found him sitting in front of his mirror
with a kind of silly smile on his face
dead the poor fellow had shot him-
self we buried him quietly but it
made us all do too much thinking

  there are three things you have to
do in the islands forget that women
ever lived leave drink alone and never
worry

  kennedy lit a comfortable cigar and
tipped his chair back against the rail-
ing putting one leg over the arm and
the other on a chair he loved to
sprawl it was a particularly hot night
we could hear the continuous racket
of the drums far off along the bay and
now and then the odd yell of a native
engaged in some peculiar work there
wasnt another white man in the dis-
trict we we were too busy listening
to kennedy to think much of this how-
ever

  i often wonder he continued why
fear doesnt get the best of us in the
end i havent met many fellows out
here who experienced the emotion and
got away alive that was what was
the matter with carson he was
afraid you couldnt have put your
hand on the exact cause of it all yet
he killed himself because of fear the
fact is a white man never was intended
for such a beastly life it isnt human
the slightest thing will set your nerves
on edge if you are not careful now
take the case of carson for instance
ill bet that none of you ever imagined
that he shot himself because of some-
thing that happened in manila months
before he came here you remember
how we used to wonder at his dread
of the tarantula i poked fun at him
until i learned the reason then i kept
still but in a civilized community i
am sure he would never have allowed
the thing to prey upon him it was
in the night that he suffered most he
had his bed surrounded by three thick-
the dead book



nesses of netting and when he retired
he would tuck the whole business care-
fully under a mattress so that there
wasnt a chance for a mosquito as he
claimed to enter i knew better he
lived in terror of the tarantula he
had heard of how they crawled into
houses sometimes and walked over one
in the darkness ill admit it is enough
to make ones flesh creep well it
made him tremble near the end he
hardly dared to sleep at all i could
have killed bimey when he put that
dead one in his bed as a practical joke
bimey was sorry enough later on but
it didnt do carson any good

  it was funny how i happened to
be the one who learned the truth from
carsons own lips before he died one
night-it must have been around twelve
or one-i heard some one rap on my
door i was reading and when i an-
swered it there stood carson in the yel-
low light streaming over my shoulders
looking for all the world like a ghost
he was wearing a peculiar sort of
kimono that he affected and i was
struck by the fact that he had only
one slipper on i begged him to come
in he took a cigarette but it was
some time before he spoke i sup-
pose you think im a fool he remarked
after a while i hastened to disagree
with him oh dont do that my
nerves are on edge and i cant sleep
and before he left me i had listened
to one of the strangest stories i have
ever heard i didnt say anything to
you fellows he didnt ask to have
the thing kept secret but i thought it
best fellows like bimey never under-
stand

  it seems that when he first came
to the islands he was stationed for a
time in manila he had taken rather
a fancy to the old city and loved to
ramble around the luneta and through
the tondo the sight of the natives in
their ridiculous costumes amused him
it wasnt long however before he be-

gan to grow a little tired of the life
it was this that led him into strange
portions of the city and on long walks
through the country when he ought to
have been at work he was a curiously
imaginative chap building dreams out
of a mere desire i guess that was why
he thought he could get rich by coming
down here he did manage to keep
away from the women and he didnt
carouse much finally he got keenly
interested in an old monastery that
faced on the calle palacio in the intra-
muros you know where it is the
place is about three hundred years old
and the walls look as though they were
built to withstand a ten-month siege
carson said that he heard of a book
they kept there an old hand-painted
bible which had been brought over by
magellan it was kept chained to a
table it was already centuries old
when it first came over so the story
went the room where they kept the
thing was locked all the time carson
said that a strange tale had grown up
around it any one who dared to spend
a night studying it never came out
alive many students had died in this
way and it was deemed best by the
prior to lock the doors and make it
impossible for any one else to run the
risk

  carson once his interest was fully
aroused refused to listen to any ob-
jections in the end he convinced the
authorities that they could let him ex-
amine the book without danger the
prior decided not to let him go alone
and when carson called as per agree-
ment he gave the keys to a trusty monk
and ordered him to stay in the room
during the time carson was there on
the way down through the musty cor-
ridors they ran over the history of the
book the peculiar part about it all
was that when some one read the faded
print for a few hours alone they were
found dead their eyes popped out as
though in abject fear the mouth open


the dead book

and the hands gripping the table like
vises about fifty years previous to
carsons visit some stranger had ob-
tained permission to spend a night in
the room and had astounded the monks
by walking out of the place the next
morning as quiet and contained as when
he entered it he showed them the
book lying wide open on the stand with
a soft furred thing that he had
crushed he said that while he was
reading a thin thread alive had curled
around over the cover clasps followed
by two eyes that peeped over the great
back of the book at first he could
not stir but watched it fascinated his
very heart seemed to stop beating
when the blurred eyes neared his own
he had sprung to his feet from a sud-
den overflowing of courage and had
dosed the heavy volume with a slam
a colorless liquid had forced its way
out through the leaves and for a few
moments his excited senses realized
that a single tendon waved tremulously
forward and backward and then
stopped an odor as of almonds hung
upon the suffocating atmosphere and
he rushed for the little door in order
to let in some fresh air when the
morning dawned he smilingly told the
monks that there was no more danger
after eating a hearty breakfast he left
them he had not beei seen again

  the monk who accompanied carson
told the story for perhaps the thou-
sandth time as they opened doors and
tramped through seemingly endless
corridors on their way to the cell where
the book was kept carson distinctly
remembered the monk telling him that
be didnt believe there was the least
bit of danger in fact he confessed
that he based his conclusions on the
death of the animal or specter that had
haunted those ominous pages he
smiled in a superior sort of way when
carson warned him not to place any
faith in that ancient tale if people
died then he said as they neared the

top of a narrow staircase that led into
the very bowels of the earth they can
die now carson laughed as he drove
this warning home somehow the echo
of his laugh seemed to collect more
echoes as it sung back of him down
an empty dark corridor he turned
his head over his shoulder after hesi-
tating then cursed himself for giving
in to his vivid imagination it was at
this moment that the monk pulled a
large key from his pocket and inserted
it within a small doorway that faced
directly upon the base of the spiral
staircase down which they had come
after some trouble it yielded to his
efforts and he entered followed by
carson one match spluttered and went
out in the darkness it had been years
since the place was opened and for
some time is was difficult to coax a
candle into lighting the shadows
formed weird arabesques on the wall
and as the monk moved across the
floor his shape loomed high above them
and seemed to bend strangely at the
juncture of the wall and ceiling huge
cobwebs dangled in their eyes carson
felt a thin piece of gossamer float be-
fore him and jumped as a tiny spider
ran hurriedly over his lips he brushed
it off

  it was deathly still for the first
time he saw through the half light an
oaken table and on it the heavy book
chained as was the custom in older
days the links had rusted and he
snapped one of them between his nim-
ble fingers he looked closely at the
yellow pages marveling at the won-
drous art work of the master who had
illuminated them great capital letters
stretched down the margins in faded
greens yellows and reds it was well
nigh impossible to read the sentences
he had brought a huge magnifying
glass with him he applied it and
was surprised to see how the words
leaped at him as though greedy to be
deciphered after a half century of re-
the dead book



tirement in spite of the age carson
saw that the strong lines plainly held
their shape with the aid of his glass
he might easily read what he desired
raising his head he spoke to the monk
his eye happened to catch sight of an
ancient cupboard in one end of the cell
leaving the monk to examine the bible
he stepped over the musty floor and
turned the knob he found nothing
within except a very strange odor it
might have been that of almonds he
wasnt sure just then he heard a cry
which he admitted to me had dung
to him ever since it wasnt so much
a cry as a sort of long-drawn-out sob
that filled every crook and cranny of
the tiny room he swung about on his
heels and saw the monk falling to the
floor dragging the table over on his
head the candle went out as it fol-
lowed the book in the downward crash
carson was left in absolute impenetra-
ble darkness

  as he said it took him about a
minute to collect his senses that as
you know is a mighty long time under
such circumstances he didnt hear
another sound but his nostrils began
to fill with that nasty odor it seemed
to madden him he wasted twenty
matches trying to light one of them
when he had found the candle and
raised it above his head so as to obtain
a better view of the cell he saw that
the monk lay perfectly still a comer
of the table had crashed through his
skull a moving thread curled back
into the leaves of the book lying at
his feet carson saw this with startled
eyes letting out a silly shriek he
rushed out of the door and up the
winding stairs down the long corridors
and out into the sunlight there is
something about the sun which is
friendly and warm and in a little while
he was feeling better the prior came
running out into the garden followed
by the other monks they heard the
story with absolute silence carson

spoke as he described it to me through
chattering lips his voice sounded far
off he waved his hands foolishly and
then collapsed

  that was all there was to the ad-
venture he kept still about it because
the good old prior begged him to it
would have been disbelieved anyhow
the story was given out that a heavy
table killed the monk indeed carson
was sure that this was what really had
killed him he was taken into a quiet
room and nursed back to reason in a
very short while he really possessed
a fairly level head it isnt surprising
that he attributed the whole thing later
on to some queer delusion his fear
of the tarantula however grew out of
this he couldnt have sworn that that
was the thing which had haunted the
book it was too large anyhow it
was very much like one this much he
knew absolutely

  kennedy lit another cigar and made
himself a bit more comfortable i was
conscious of not having moved during
the whole recital of the story my
cramped muscles ached and i moved
a sleeping leg with some difficulty
the noise of the ceaseless drums beat
on my ears more aggravatingly than
ever we waited silently he went
on

  well there isnt much more to tell
bimey came to me the following morn-
ing with white lips and begged me to
go to carsons room i had parted
from him the night before feeling that
i had effectually quieted his aroused
nerves bimeys frightened counte-
nance left me cold i opened carsons
door and found him sitting before the
mirror clasping in one hand a large
revolver i saw what happened in a
moment while bimey ran for the
servants i looked down at the smile
which had frozen itself into the tight
lips of the dead man i have always
been a close observer at this time
i was especially so i couldnt for
the dead book

the life of me figure out why carson
had killed himself so suddenly then
as i heard the steps of the servants
down the hallway my eye caught the
end of a red tie protruding from a
book lying on the table i glanced back
at carsons body and then in the mir-
ror for some unknown reason i saw
the book clearly the glass was cheap
and the red tie seemed to waver and
fade in the distance after they took
him away i sat down in the chair my-
self turning my head slightly to the
left i could catch just a glimpse of
the tie i was startled by it to my
muddled mind it seemed to be a mon-
strous spider in a flash the whole
thing came over my mind poor car-
son had returned to his room thinking
that he would get a good nights sleep
he lit the light this was still burning
by the way and sat down before his
dresser for a second perhaps he was
looking for something in one of the
drawers he found it i have no doubt
when the cold steel touched his sensi-
tive fingers he must have started back

and gained his first glimpse of the tie
resting in the book i tried the same
trick i knew which drawer the re-
volver was kept in as i had often seen
him take it out before we went beyond
the compound on a business trip that
was when the order first went into effect
that no white man could go out with-
out a revolver or rifle

  still sitting in the chair i lifted my
hand as though i were holding the
weapon and pointed it over my shoul-
der the reflection in the glass was
so indistinct and blurred that it was
difficult to aim at the book it was
clear enough to me then he had meant
to shoot what he thought was a taran-
tula and had by mistake killed himself
in fact the bullet had passed through
the back part of his head i have never
said anything about this before because
of bimey he was sorry enough after-
ward as it was without my adding
the true story of how carson died i
have never felt that i had a right to
until i learned of bimeys death the
other day

                 stray thoughts
octor johnson says the beginning and end of ghost stories is this-
all argument is against them all belief for them

    alluding to this remark of doctor johnsons byron writes

               i merely mean to say what johnson said

that in the course of some six thousand years

               all nations have believed that from the dead
                 a visitant at intervals appears

               and what is stranger yet on this strange head
             is that whatever bars the reason rears
             gainst such belief theres something stronger yet
             in its behalf let those deny who will

    schopenhauer says belief in ghosts is bom with man it is found in all
ages and in all countries and no one is quite free from it

    voltaire says it is not at all an uncommon thing for a person under a
strong emotion to see that which is not

    lafcadio hearn says probably the fear of ghosts as well as the belief
in had its beginning in dreams

    andrew lang says apparently there is some material groundwork for a
belief which savages share with fellows of the royal society

chapter xvii

when merrill recovered con-
sciousness he found himself
lying on the floor of the big
dining hall the room was lighted by
the candle that he had lit on first com-
ing there his head ached from the
blow he had received but otherwise he
seemed to be all right

  he heard the voices of german sol-
diers and as he slightly opened his eyes
he could see them within a few feet
of him there were four of them and
as his wits fully returned he heard
what they said

  the herr von sturm is in a fine
rage

  he wanted to get them alive be-
fore the war he was going to marry
her she was his cousin

  what did he take them out for
asked one of the men

  to bury them

  thats a waste of time why not
let them rot up there

  this is his place

  oh thats different why didnt he
make one job of it and throw this fel-
low into the same hole

  he isnt dead yet

  ach whats the difference he
will be soon enough a traitor

  a terrible fury took possession of
merrill he might have saved her
now she was dead these brutes
these horrible brutes

  suddenly a passionate longing to
avenge her seized him it was of no
consequence if he were killed in trying
he opened his eyes and took more par-
ticular note of the situation he was
lying somewhat in the shadow and the
men were paying no attention to him

  he moved his arms and legs slightly
just enough to give him the assurance

that he was sound his left shoulder
was a little sore but evidently the
wound was very slight cautiously he
felt on the outside of his coat pocket
the automatic was there no doubt the
other automatic was in the other pocket

  very slowly he put his hand into the
pocket and took out the automatic and
transferred it to his right hand be-
ing the one that was in the left pocket
it had not been used he softly pulled
the slide and his weapon was ready

  with the greatest care and with his
eyes fixed on the men to see when they
should look around at him he rose to
a kneeling position and then to a posi-
tion with one foot on the floor he
took careful aim and fired

  his man uttered a cry and sank
slowly down the others in stupid won-
der turned toward merrill two more
of his bullets had accomplished their
deadly mission before the fourth man
turned to run apparently the sur-
prise was so complete that none of them
had thought of their own weapons
the fleeing man shot in the back
stumbled and fell

  merrill listened at the door near
which they had been standing and
hearing no sound gathered up the rifles
and retired with them to the other end
of the dining hall and opening the
door by which he and rose had en-
tered stood back in the dark hallway
and waited

  he felt of the lock of one of the sol-
diers rifles and knew in a moment that
the mechanism was one he understood
the other three he disposed against the
wall he meant to use the rifles first
and afterward the pistols if the need
came he was not as expert with the
rifle but told himself grimly that it
was deadlier and at that distance he
had little doubt of hitting his mark
strasbourg rose



he knew now that he could shoot a
man with a steady hand

  he set himself to wait one of the
mn uttered a groan merrill who
never swore now ground out a savage
curse and promised to find a way of
keeping them still if one of them made
another sound at that moment he
fully understood what a murderous
rage was

  the candle was beginning to sink and
flare up in its death struggles filling
the great room with mysterious shad-
ows and he was wondering if after all
the light would go out and rob him
of his chance when the door opened
and friedrich strode in

  bring that fellow out he com-
manded and then uttered a loud cry
of pain and terror as a bullet from
merrills rifle struck him

  he reeled back through the open
door the candle flared up and went
out merrill heard the door slam
there was a hurried scurrying from
the other side and then silence

  merrill reckless of any danger ran
the length of the room and opened the
door and listened he heard the sound
of moving men as if carrying a bur-
den and guessed that there had been
soldiers behind the captain and that
they were taking him out of the house

  he had left the rifle behind him but
snatched one of the pistols from his
pocket and felt of the mechanism it
was new to him and he couldnt make
it work he lost time in tossing aside
the german pistols and finding one of
his own but he made that ready and
started in pursuit in the darkness he
test his way so that by the time he
came to the open great door of the
chateau the men supporting their officer
had reached a big automobile that stood
in the courtyard

  he fired into the group he heard
a man cry out and drop the others
clambered hastily into the car and as
he fired again the car started and flew

through the big gates he ran after the
car firing again in his passion he
tried to shoot again although he knew
it was useless since the car was out
of reach however he had emptied
the magazine and while he still rn
feeling for the other automatic his rea-
son asserted itself he stopped and
turned back

  he walked slowly his fury spent
he was not even sure that he had
mortally wounded friedrich he felt
utterly alone in the world he had noth-
ing to live for he moved along me-
chanically  and entered the house
grief paralyzing grief was all he could
feel he sat down on the wide stone
steps before the door and buried his
face in his hands rose was dead
he could think of nothing else at the
moment he sat there as if neither
time nor place mattered

  after a long time he rose and went
into the house and groped his way back
to the dining hall the groans of the
men lying there he scarcely heard and
left entirely unheeded he found his
way to the smaller stairway and
mounted it if he had tried to recall
exactly how to go he might have failed
as it was he reached the open space
where the stairway led down from the
corridor and then had no difficulty in
reaching the door of roses room he
remembered that it was bolted on the
inside and that the door was a solid
one but he turned his back and kicked
at one of the panels until he had broken
it then he reached in and pushed
aside the bolt

  he remembered just where she had
pressed to start the wardrobe and after
a little while he had found the spot
and had pushed the heavy piece of fur-
niture aside when he reached the lit-
tle room he stood on the threshold
it was so black he could see nothing
but the picture of what he had last
seen there was clear and distinct

  oh my darling he moaned
ioo

strasbourg rose

  he remembered he had matches in
his pocket and lighted one perhaps
he had had a secret unformed hope in
his heart in going there if he had had
it perished for the room was empty
she was gene and pierre was gone
and both now probably occupied the
same grave

  he went over and knelt where she
had lain on the floor the match
burned his fingers and he let it fall and
lighted another there was a red spot
on the floor still damp with her blood
he took his handkerchief from his
pocket and mopped up the dampness
it was the only memento he had of her

  he let the second match burn out
and drop from his fingers as he still
knelt there then as if this much of
contact with her pure spirit had recalled
him to the realities of life he thought
of what she would have had him do
he had the important information in
his pocket he must get it to paris
it might be that by this time they would
have been warned and would stop him
at the german lines well that was
a chance he must take at least he
would make the attempt

  he retraced his steps down to the
dining hall and after many failures
made his way out of the chateau as
he had come in he remembered she
had said to go due south which way
was due south he looked up at the
sky in which the stars had now ap-
peared and found ursa major and
from that the north star he had his
course but he had yet to find the path
by which they had come out of the
forest he always marveled how he
accomplished it but he did and was
presently picking his way along the
path he strayed from the path once
or twice but always found it again
and in the end came out upon the road
where he had left the car

  perhaps if he had thought more care-
fully he would never have been able to
find his way but he drove mechanically

seeming subconsciously to remember
the twists and turns and at last he
reached the inner german lines

  he had some difficulty in getting
through for they were curious about
his companion but he explained that
she had been left behind on important
business and as it was known that she
was in the intelligence department he
was allowed to pass

  when he reached the french lines
he said frankly that his companion had
been suspected and killed by the boches
he asked for some one to go with him
and guide him to paris as he had im-
portant information he was doubtless
looked upon with suspicion so he was
taken to headquarters and finally sent
on to paris with two soldiers and a
lieutenant in the tonneau

  it was daylight when they entered
paris they went at once to the cite
though it seemed unlikely that colonel
le brun would be in his office at that
hour he was however and merrill
was taken to him at once he had been
there all night it seemed working
and now he was waiting for the return
of rose and merrill

  a flicker of trouble showed in his
keen eyes as merrill entered without
rose but he waited for merrill to
speak merrill however only drew out
the paper he had brought and laid it
on the colonels desk his face was
grim and hard and showed such lines
of suffering that the colonel held the
paper in his hand while he studied him

  and mademoiselle dalmeyrac he
asked hesitatingly

  dead and buried monsieur le colo-
nel shot in the back by her cousin
who refused to let me save her

  there was something so unutterably
tragic in this brief response and in the
set face of the speaker that colonel
le brun covered his face with his hand
for a moment before he could speak
when he did it was in a tone infinitely
tender
strasbourg rose

iox

  monsieur he said can you bring
yourself to tell me

  i do not know how i ever shall
merrill answered

  the colonel moved out of all com-
posure sprang up and brought forward
a chair into which he forced merrill
to sit and then without preface
merrill recounted the whole story even
going into detail

  god rest her soul the colonel said
reverently standing up tears in his
eyes as for you monsieur i can
say nothing to you that will expresss
my sympathy and my sorrow she
gave her all for france

  not all monsieur le colonel mer-
rill said dry-eyed and stem i am
still here and i am hers to give she
would have me give my all to france
also and i am ready

  but monsieur-

  pardon me if i internipt but while
there is one german brute alive i am
dedicated to kill you will enable me
to join the foreign legion that is
all i ask of you

  but monsieur he said after a short
pause you can serve us so much bet-
ter if you will use your gifts in the
hospitals

  that may be but i think i am en-
titled to choose and i choose to carry
a rifle and go where there are germans
to kill i speak plainly monsieur but
i tell you i have forgotten all i know
of surgery i want to forget it i
could never use an instrument without
remembering that i was not permitted
to save rose dalmeyrac and then my
heart would cease to beat and my eyes
to see and my hand to hold you will
help me

  at least you will go home and rest
then come back to me you shall be
admitted whenever you come

  merrill rose i will go home and
rest--perhaps i will return again as
you say but monsieur le colonel i
shall come only to ask of you what you

cannot refuse-to get me into the for-
eign legion i have no need to think
it over my mind is set on that one
thing unless you can point out to me
how in any other way i can be more
deadly to the boches pardon me if
i say you owe me this

  the colonel sighed he could un-
derstand the soul of the man who stood
before him so cold and implacable
very well monsieur it shall be as you
wish i will attend to everything
merrill bowed and left without an-
other word

chapter xviii

r the first few months after joining
the foreign legion merrill was
moody and silent but as he had learned
his duties as a soldier quickly and well
he had no trouble moreover he had
one characteristic that soon raised him
high in the estimation of his officers
and fellows-he was always ready for
any dangerous duty was always in the
forefront of any battle they were
all a dare-devil lot in the legion but
they all agreed that for cold ferocity
in fighting they had never seen merrills
equal and as his strength and swift-
ness of movement were in proportion
to his ferocity he soon became a notable
person

  he had enlisted under his own name
for since there was no longer any rea-
son why he should masquerade he had
with the assistance of colonel le brun
established his identity and settled the
affairs of poor richard lowell

  as the months went by his moodi-
ness fell from him for it was not in
human nature that he should remain
always in a state of savage fury but
his grief was unassuaged and if he
became gentle and kindly in his man-
ner there was always a certain aloof-
ness in his life with his fellows and
this they respected because they re-
spected him


strasbourg rose

  one decoration after another came
to him until it seemed as if he had
won all that could be given him oc-
casionally he was wounded but never
so severely that he was out of the ranks
for a long time

  when the united states finally de-
clared war and began to send her sol-
diers over he was transferred to that
army with many other americans in
the legion

  it was soon discovered that he was
an exceedingly competent soldier and
was quickly raised in rank until in the
summer of  he was a captain
fighting at the head of his company
when the germans were driven back
from the marne he was indifferent
to promotion or decorations but it was
found that he was absolutely to be re-
lied on to carry out any order given
him and that he had the initiative and
the soldierly knowledge necessary for
any occasion and his men adored
him a colonelcy came to him and
with his regiment he was transferred
south to the region of the heights of
the meuse

  he had never asked for leave and
had never accepted it when it was
offered but a little while after he was
transferred south he was sent on a
mission to paris because of his knowl-
edge of french

  i beg your pardon general said
he when he had received his instruc-
tions but may i ask you a question 
certainly colonel

  it is rumored that an advance is in
preparation can you tell me if it is
correct 

  yes

  i hope i shall be back in time to
participate sir

  the general smiled youd rather
fight than eat wouldnt you

  i would rather kill a german than
do anything else that is why i am
in the army merrill answered in a
cold even tone

  well said the general you have
the reputation of being more than
fairly successful at it colonel merrill
you will be back in time for the ad-
vance

  that man said the general to one
of his staff as merrill went out has
a devil in him did you see those cold
blue eyes of his when he spoke of kill-
ing germans just the same hes as
good an officer as if hed been raised
at west point

  merrill was not long in doing what
he had to do but it was necessary for
him to wait for two or maybe three
days

  one night he was sitting at a table
in a cafe on the boulevard des italiens
when a small nondescript sort of man
came and sat at the same table he
looked at him casually and was struck
by something familiar in his face but
looked away instantly with his usual in-
difference

  you do not remember me colonel
merrill the man said softly in french

  merrill looked at him steadily for a
moment yes you are monsieur la-
roque i hope everything is well with
the chief

  excellently well monsieur was the
answer still in an almost inaudible
tone he asked me to come to you
and ask you to go to him

  you knew i was here then

  as soon as you came and indeed
monsieur le colonel we have watched
you with pride and interest if you will
permit me to say so

  merrill shrugged his shoulders
what does the chief want of me
laroque ventured on the most depre-
cating smile merrill thought he had
ever seen you ask me that mon-
sieur he queried

  merrill answered with a smile that
was exceedingly rare on his face in
these days yes i should have known
better if you knew and of course
you do you would not tell me when
strasbourg rose



does he wish to see me my time is
my own

  he would see you now if you would
go to him

  merrill paid his score at once and
left the cafe he was too sane a man
to bear any ill will toward le brun
because of the part he had played in
sending rose to her death but their
paths had not crossed during the years
he had been in the army so that he
had not met him since he had joined
the legion

  he was taken to him without delay
proving to merrill that the colonel had
expected him the two men shook
hands like tried friends before they sat
down

  you would not have come near me
if i had not asked you le brun said
almost reproachfully

  this is the first time i have been
in paris excepting to pass through it
besides i know how busy you are

  i sometimes have wondered if you
had forgiven me

  i didnt feel that i had anything to
forgive i felt so at the time and now
that i understand what this struggle
means i realize fully that you were
doing only your duty it is fate that
some one should suffer when duty is
done

  are you sure monsieur asked le
brun in an incidental sort of way that
mademoiselle died that time

  merrill knew le brun too well to
be deceived by the question he knew
it covered more than it seemed why
do you ask  he demanded with a
quickness that had something of fierce-
ness in it

  my friend be calm

  you have more than reason mon-
sieur le colonel you know something
in the name of god tell me

  she is alive and well monsieur
merrill stared at him his face going
white you would not say that unless
you were sure he said huskily

  i have it from one of my most re-
liable sources word came to me yes-
terday she did not die the wound
was a bad one but thanks to her splen-
did constitution she recovered com
pletely and is now as well as ever
he went on seeing that merrill was like
one stunned he wished to give him
time to recover himself she was car-
ried off in the same car with captain
von sturm he risked her life it is
true but it came out right in the end
where is she merrill asked

  in strasbourg she has been hid-
den there but kept a captive by her
cousin

  my god murmured merrill cov
ering his face with his hands she is
alive she is alive the world was
suddenly altered for him

  my friend said colonel le brun
i cannot tell you what happiness it
gives me to be able to give you this
assurance

  there is no doubt

  i believe there is no doubt what-
ever would you like to talk with the
man who brought me the word
merrill leaped to his feet where is
he let me talk with him i do not
doubt you monsieur you must under-
stand that but to talk with one--
oh where is he

  already le brun had touched a but-
ton and almost as merrill ceased to
speak one of the silent expressionless
attendants of whom there seemed so
many in this center of secret intelli-
gence entered

  bring saulnier here le brun or-
dered

  a few minutes later a man who might
have been a german from his appear-
ance stood before le brun saul-
nier he said this is the gentleman
of whom mademoiselle dalmeyrac
spoke to you

  she spoke of me you saw her
yes monsieur if you are mon-
sieur merrill
xo

strasbourg rose

  yes yes i am he

  she bade me find you or if i
could not to beg monsieur le colonel
to do so and to tell you that she waited
for you that she is quite well if not
quite happy

  you know her demanded merrill
eagerly you could not be mistaken
you are sure

     know her very well monsieur
there is no mistake

  saulnier is an alsatian and knew
mademoiselle before the war le brun
assured merrill

  merrill laughed softly and caught le
brun by the hand and wrung it he
hardly knew what he was doing the
cold icy calm that had seemed part
of his nature for so long had melted
away le brun himself a man of iron
yet seemed to understand what was
taking place within merrill he knew
he was choked with joy incapable for
the moment of any thought but the mir-
acle of roses resurrection

  saulnier he said tell monsieur
le colonel the whole story he is of
us in a sense so you need not fear
being indiscreet

  merrill sat down again and fixed his
eager hungry eyes on the man yes
yes he said tell me everything did
she send me any other message
saulnier smiled deprecatingly alas
monsieur the time was so short i
have told you all that passed between
us she spoke of nothing but you
monsieur

  you must understand monsieur
interposed le brun that saulnier has
been in strasbourg on a dangerous
mission

  i might have learned long before
that mademoiselle was there saulnier
went on only she has been hidden
very carefully we have many sym-
pathizers in strasbourg of course and
all of them know mademoiselle but it
was believed that she was dead until
suspicion of something peculiar was

aroused by the actions of captain von
sturm her cousin he was watched
then and it was discovered that he had
a prisoner in his country house which
is on the other side of the rhine he
could go there easily because be is sta-
tioned in strasbourg

  captain von sturm interjected le
brun is favored for some reason and
is not in active service

  he was severely wounded said
saulnier and is not strong also it
is known that many alsatians are dis-
affected and it is thought he has in-
fluence with them or that he can spy
upon them the germans are very
nervous just now

  le brun laughed they have dis-
covered that the americans are here
and that they know how to fight you
have taught them that anyhow my
friend

  merrill smiled in response but his
eyes were on saulnier and his thoughts
with rose she is in this country
house you say

  not now recently she has been
brought to a house he has in the city
where his mother is there she was
seen and her identity discovered in
fact one of the maids is a friend of
ours it was through her that i had
the chance to speak to mademoiselle
you say she is quite well asked
merrill

  well in body monsieur le colonel
but she is troubled in spirit because
her cousin demands that she marry
him the maid told me that he per-
secutes her constantly

  well growled merrill instantly
alert even in germany one cannot
compel a woman to marry against her
will i suppose

  that is true monsieur but it seems
he threatens to hand her over to the
military court if she refuses

  merrill clenched his hands and
started up the dog he cried
oh said le brun with a shrug
strasbourg rose

that is only what you call bluff he
is trying to frighten her and made-
moiselle dalmeyrac is not so easily
frightened do not disturb yourself
my friend

  you do not know him answered
merrill he is a true boche he would
stop at nothing

  but mademoiselle would not marry
him for anything cried saulnier
she has refused over and over and
dares him to do his worst

  yes yes groaned merrill she
would die first but i do not wish her
to die and i am helpless helpless
he began to pace the floor distractedly
suddenly he stopped perhaps i could
get word to her he queried of le
brun

  i do not know saulnier cannot re-
turn perhaps i can get word through
by way of metz what word would
you send

  i would have her cajole him with
hope you see monsieur i may not
go to her now i am needed but later
i shall find a way tell her that if
she can put him off she can count on
me

  but my dear friend protested le
brun who seeing the firm jaw grimly
set and knowing the indomitable daring
of the man feared he would do some-
thing rash you must not think of try-
ing to rescue her you may depend
on her to hold him off till the war is
ended

  a year perhaps cried merrill
who knows how long they will hold
out i cannot wait so long knowing
the danger she is in

  but what can you do no no
trust me to get word to her and do
not despair believe me this war will
not last as long as many think as
for getting into strasbourg saulnier
will tell you how difficult that is now
they are more strict than ever
where is the house she is in mer-

rill demanded of saulnier can you
describe it to me

  do you know strasbourg mon-
sieur

  not at all but that doesnt matter
describe it to me

  you are planning something fool-
hardy le brun said reproachfully

  no i am planning nothing but one
never knows what may happen do
not fear that i will forget my duty
no i will not do that but if i know

just where she is- you will let him

tell me my friend it can do no harm
to know that

  tell him saulnier le brun an-
swered with a sigh

  it is not so easy since he doesnt
know strasbourg you must know
monsieur that in the center of the city
there are many narrow crooked streets
it is very very old there and the
streets are the same as they were hun-
dreds of years ago also most of the
houses it is in one of these houses
that mademoiselle is kept it is called
the illestrasse from the river  i
suppose the number is ninety-five
but if you were there it would not be

  no monsieur saulnier agreed
merrill his eyes gleaming it would
not be easy i know and of course i
am not there but perhaps you are per-
mitted to tell me the name of one who
could be trusted

  monsieur cried le brun tom be-
tween uneasiness and admiration of the
indomitable persistence of the man
you are planning dont tell me you
are not what you have in your mind

i	cannot guess but something is there
remember you have my promise to get
word to mademoiselle

  i am not forgetting monsieur as
for planning you are mistaken but
it is like this i have found all through
my life that what i will to do-really
determinedly will to do-i do sooner
or later i see nothing clearly now
io

strasbourg rose

hut the time will come when i can
see clearly it may be that we shall
take strasbourg then i would wish
to know how to reach mademoiselle
without delay it may be that i shall
get there in some other way surely
you will help me so far

  le brun shook his head and smiled
if everybody had a will like yours
monsieur the world would be a hard
place to live in well you shall know
since i can refuse you nothing in the
grosse metzig there is a beer hall or
a brasserie called the golden fleece
tell him what to do saulnier

  you turn to your left when you
nter and take the tablein the comer
by the window if you go in the after-
noon any day but sunday you will
always find the same waiter and two
oclock is the best time when the
waiter comes for your order pick up
the tray and turn it over and rap lightly
on the table three times when he
asks for your order say you want dark
beer does monsieur speak german
better than french

  he will ask you if you want the old
or the new you will say the old
when he brings you the beer you will
say the old is always better than the
new if it is safe for him to speak
to you he will say that it is not only
in beer that the old is better then you
may ask your question only you must
be very very careful

  you see cried le brun saul-
nier speaks as if he expected you to go
there

  but yes said saulnier looking at
merrill i know that monsieur will go
there i hope he will come away also

chapter xix

fterrill was far from being free
 from anxiety but the great cloud
of gloom and misery that had weighed
upon him for so long had lifted so
that when he rejoined his regiment the

difference in his manner was remarked
by men and officers alike he smiled
often and jested it was impossible
for him to conceal the lightness of his
spirits he didnt see his way yet to
going to rose but he counted on the
word le brun would send her and he
felt once more as if there was a link
between them intangible as it was

  the advance that he had suspected
of being in preparation took place soon
after his return st mihiel was as-
saulted and taken and although little
was made of it in comparison with its
importance merrill knew that it was
only the first of those offensive steps
that were to carry the american army
on

  one day of frightful carnage merrill
was holding his men ready for action
when word was brought to him to clear
up a certain patch of woods which
seemed fairly alive with machine guns
that were harassing the main body of
troops they cleared the woods and
held them but merrill and a small body
advanced too far and were surrounded
by a greatly superior force on the far-
ther side it was the tradition-of the
regiment to neither ask for nor give
quarter so regardless of the awful
odds against them they fought to the
last man

  all went down but all were not dead
merrill and half a dozen of his men
lay stunned and they were taken pris-
oners they were carried back of the
lines and added to other prisoners some
of them frenchmen and perhaps a
dozen more americans

  merrill had received several trifling
wounds besides the blow on the head
that had rendered him unconscious
the wounds were negligible and noth-
ing but an ache remained to remind him
of the blow on the head some of the
men were sorely wounded but of the
others not of his regiment besides a
few of his own there were ten ameri-
cans able to walk these were put with
strasbourg rose

to 

a body of french prisoners and started
toward metz insulted spat upon
beaten with rifle butts and pricked with
bayonets till their blood boiled with
rage

  the officers received better treatment
than the men but even they were
grossly insulted later the men and
officers were separated the former to
be put at labor in the interior of ger-
many merrill was first taken to metz
but afterward was removed to a small
detention camp near freudenstadt he
knew nothing of this part of germany
and at first was depressed by a sense
of hopelessness his one thought now
was of rose and when he realized that
as a prisoner he was more than ever
helpless to go to her assistance he be-
came savagely rebellious

  then one day because he understood
german though he never betrayed that
fact he learned that he was in the black
forest region his heart leaped at this
and he set himself to discover how far
strasbourg was from there the day
he discovered that strasbuorg lay not
more than thirty miles to the west he
could have cried out for joy it was
almost as if they breathed the same air
from that moment he began patiently
to plan for escape

  it was near the latter end of october
before the chance he had waited for
came he had been unable to bring
himself to make the attempt alone al-
though he knew he decreased his
chances by taking others into his con-
fidence so he had told the little group
to which he belonged of his intention
and bade them all be ready to make
the break for freedom when they saw
him act

  no fuel was furnished them but they
were permitted under guard to go to
the edge of the forest which lay near
the camp to gather such branches as
fell from the trees there was not
much to be had but such as it was
it was better than nothing

  this was the opportunity that merrill
had fixed upon always when they
went out he watched for the chance
to fall upon the guard day after day
passed by without giving him the pos-
sibility he sought it was his plan to
get within leaping distance of the guard
and overpower him and then get away
into the forest before assistance could
come

  to disarm suspicion he had from the
first conducted himself in the meekest
possible manner greatly to the amaze-
ment of two american officers in the
group who had known his reputation
as a dare-devil this finally served him
in good stead for one evening when
they were gathering wood he drew
nearer to the guard a big brutal prus-
sian armed to the teeth usually the
guard cursed any man who came near
him but he looked upon the apparently
dispirited american as the most harm-
less of the lot and perhaps dreamed
of no danger from these unarmed men
anyhow certainly he yawned and idly
swore at his charges on this occasion
until merrill stood within six feet of
him then he ordered him farther
away

  yankee dog he growled keep
away or til be tempted to stick my
bayonet in you to see if you have any
blood in you

  merrill straightened up like a man
worn and enfeebled but there is
wood here he answered in stammer-
ing german

  the prussian laughed brutally and
you are cold eh 

  cold and hungry and weak an-
swered merrill measuring the distance
between them as he pretended to shiver

  good  that is the way i want
all the damned yankees to be get
out with you

the words were hardly out of his
mouth before merrill had leaped on
him and thrust his knife into his breast
the man taken by surprise made prac-
io

strasbourg rose

tically no defense but with a loud cry

drooped and sank to the earth

  merrill tore the rifle from his hands
and a pistol from his belt and darted
into the woods his companions fol-
lowed his example what became of
them he didnt know until after the war
was over then he learned that three
of them at least had made good their
escape

  it had been a part of his calculation
that night would soon come on and
make search difficult also he had fig-
ured that the germans would naturally
take it for granted that the course of
the escaped prisoners would be to the
south toward switzerland therefore
he soon swerved toward the north and
falling into a long easy stride he went
steadily on

  he rested occasionally but kept on
during the night turning after a while
toward the west lest he should get too
far from strasbourg when dawn be-
gan to break he found a hiding place
among some rocks and lay down to
sleep too tired to eat of the food he
had carried with him and which he
had concealed about him for many days
when they went out to gather wood

  he was muscle sore when he woke
late in the afternoon but he was in
good spirits he scouted about for a
little while until he was sure he was
alone when he bathed in a brook that
ran down the hill and then ate spar-
ingly

  soon after this he was obliged to
live off what he could steal from the
outlying farmhouses he ran many
risks and had some narrow escapes
he could make but little progress and
at one time was compelled to he hidden
for three days eating nothing but a
few eggs which he sucked raw the
rifle which he had carried until now
he dropped into a crevice in some rocks
deeming it useless and fearing also that
if he were seen it would at once draw
suspicion on him

  he realized that he had undertaken
a wild adventure and there were times
when he wondered if it were humanly
possible to accomplish it still he never
dreamed of turning back from it rose
was there and he was sure that she
was waiting for him

  he knew now that he was headed
in the right direction and that the city
could not be more than ten or fifteen
miles away the country was more
and more thickly settled as he prog-
ressed the little farms all highly culti-
vated standing close together the
whole country made a strange contrast
with the devastated lands of france to
which he had become accustomed

  one day he spent lying in a little
copse not far from one of the prettiest
and trimmest little farmhouse that he
had yet seen the place bore every
evidence of a prosperity far in advance
of most of the farms he had seen

  during all the latter part of the after-
noon two women bustled about from
house to bam carrying crocks and bas-
kets and bundles of vegetables which
they left in the bam it had puzzled
him at first but after a while he un-
derstood  they were loading up their
cart to take their produce to market
no doubt the morrow would be sat-
urday and they would sell their goods
in town what town  would it be
one of the smaller towns or would it
be strasbourg everything wduld de-
pend on the answer to that question

  when night came and the occupants
of the house had retired merrill crept
over to the barn and made his way
into it he had no light all the few
matches he had had having been used
up but he easily found the little cov-
ered cart which stood in the middle
of the floor and by feeling in the in-
terior satisfied himself that it had been
loaded

  he was very hungry-almost starved
in fact-so he didnt hesitate to appro-
priate four eggs some turnips and a
strasbourg rose

i

small cheese the cheese was singu-
larly odorous but it tasted to him like
manna from heaven he climbed into
the hay mow ate his fill for the first time
in many days and lay down and slept
it was still dark when he was awaked
by the sound of voices the two
women were there with a lantern get-
ting ready to put the horse into the
shafts

  he was so near the edge of the mow
that he could easily raise himself and
look over it was plain that it was
the girl who was going to drive to mar-
ket and also it was made certain by
words they let fall as they talked in
sleepy tones that strasbourg was the
obj ective

  merrill hesitated for a few moments
he knew he was taking a desperate
chance but also he was sure that there
was nothing for him but that if ever
he expected to make his way into stras-
bourg he put his hesitation aside and
smothered any natural qualms he had
about frightening two lone women

  he chose a moment when they were
together on the farther side of the cart
and of a sudden leaped out of the
mow between them and the door his
pistol in his hand

  dont cry out he said sharply i
wont hurt you if you keep quiet but
i am desperate

  the old woman almost dropped her
lantern and began to whimper in a
quavering way but the girl although
evidently in terror exclaimed in a voice
she tried to keep steady who are
you youd better behave yourself
ill report you if you dont go about
your business

  i am going about my business he
said quietly and if you will only be
calm and listen i will tell you what it
is

  if you want something to eat the
old woman said you have only to say
so

  hush grandma dear the girl

whispered then in a firmer tone to
merrill tell us what you want if
you think we are helpless you are mis-
taken

  i am a deserter he answered and
i dont know how to get back into
strasbourg i tried to get home but i
lost my way and have wandered about
the mountains and forest for many
days

  what can we do for you  the girl
demanded her manner becoming more
assured you shouldnt have de-
serted

  why do so many desert the old
woman asked querulously

  deserting cried merrill are
many deserting then

  every day the girl said promptly
why do you go back again if you
want food we will give it to you and
we could spare a little money couldnt
we grandma

  you would really help a deserter 
merrill asked wondering

 why not we dont want to get
into any trouble but we hate the war
we could feed you and you could get
away before daylight

  merrill had heard stories for some
time before he was captured of deser-
tions from the german army but had
not credited them believing them pris-
oners lies intended to create a false
impression

  i suppose he said doubtfully you
couldnt let me have any clothes  im
all in rags

  the girl took the lantern from her
grandmother and held it up so that she
could see her visitor when she saw
how tall and stalwart he was a hard
ring came into her voice as she de-
manded are you a prussian
no fraulein  i am really from vi-
enna i thank god i am not a prus-
sian

  good  she ejaculated you dont
have the speech of a prussian put
no

strasbourg rose

your pistol away and come to the house
come grandma

chapter xx

rerrill was seated at a table in
the kitchen and supplied with
food and hot coffee the girl eyed
him sharply studying him with a puz-
zled air suddenly she said if you
are an austrian what are you doing
here there are no longer austrians
fighting you know that

  a few were left behind he said
uncomfortably and then to change the
trend of her thought he added i
must apologize to you for taking some
food out of your cart last night
what did you take demanded the
old woman sharply

  four eggs a cheese and some tur-
nips

  they can be replaced the girl said
quietly you are not an austrian
you are not a prussian either i can see
that but you are a gentleman i can
tell that by your language you have
a slight accent too and you are polite
yes you are a gentleman although you
dont look it why dont you tell me
the truth 

  merrill ceased to eat and looked
into her eyes a more honest pair of
blue eyes he told himself he had never
looked into she was clever too and
better educated than girls of her class
usually are in germany he drew a
long breath

  i would like to tell you the truth
he said i have been lying to you
because my life is in danger

  i wonder she said her face very
serious if you are hot an escaped
prisoner

  he stared at her and then at her
grandmother who had stopped her bus-
tling about to watch him yes he
said impulsively i am

  i thought so murmured the girl
not french english perhaps

  he rose from the table and straight-
ened himself no american

  ach ejaculated the old woman
an american so

  there was a peculiar something in
her tone that made him turn and stare
at her he was sure she was beaming
at him with pleasure written all over
her wrinkled face he turned in won-
der to the girl she was regarding him
very soberly

  sit down and eat she said gravely
you are safe here

  yes yes cried the old woman i
have a son in america heinrich bohler
you know him perhaps

  no i have never met him

  i have a cousin in your army the
girl said also heinrich bohler where
did you escape from

  freudenstadt

  you are not a spy

  on my honor i am not

  what are you doing here why
didnt you escape to switzerland that
would have been easy enough

  he hesitated he didnt doubt them
now but it was too amazing to accept
readily then he spoke frankly i
will tell you everything do you know
a captain von sturm in strasbourg
i do not know him but i have seen
him often

  he has a fine house over there
the old woman interjected pointing to
the north

  well went on merrill he has a
cousin rose dalmeyrac

  she is dead the girl said

  no she is alive and in his hands
in strasbourg i love her and i am
going to strasbourg to save her from
him

  the girl shook her head slowly it
is impossible dont you know that
strasbourg is full of soldiers you
would be arrested at once it is true
that it is a large city but a young man
big and strong who was not in the
army-
strasbourg rose

hi

  merrill smiled obstinately i have
thought of that but i shall try it many
things can be done that seem impossible
the thing just now is to get into the
city

  the girl waved to him to sit down
again and herself took a chair at the
opposite side of the table it might
be possible to get you into the city
she said tell me your plan i have
time

  my plan was to threaten you and
make you let me conceal myself in your
cart it would not be difficult

  no she replied slowly it would
be quite possible my cart is never
searched many try to get out of the
city but no one-wants to get in who
cannot get out my cart is always
searched when i come out if you went
in you would have to remain

  i wish to remain if you will help
me to get in i shall trouble you no
more although as long as i live i shall
bless you

  the girl sat silent for a while re-
flecting and merrill watching her anx-
iously thought he had never seen a
german girl so self-reliant so com-
pletely mistress of herself she turned
to her grandmother who also had been
watching her as if the decision lay with
her we will help him grandma
the girl said at last

  naturally assented the old woman
with emphasis

  merrill started to express his grati-
tude but the girl stopped him you
must understand first then we will
make plans my uncle heinrich
bought this place for his mother he
wanted her always to go to him in
america where he is rich he has
a grocery store before the war she
could not bring herself to leave here
now she is eager to go when the war
is over we shall go to america that
is one reason why we are willing to
help you

  and broke in the old woman

smiling broadly anna and young
heinrich are sweethearts she will be
an american girl

  the girl blushed and then smiled
yes she said that is the real rea-
son i like all americans because
heinrich is american it was your
very good fortune that you came to
us

  the good god guided him said
the old woman in a tone of conviction
any other place they would have be-
trayed you tell me young man does
fraulein dalmeyrac love you

  oh yes he answered his face
lighting up

  that is good cried the old woman
clapping her hands together anna
you must think up some fine way to
help them anna she said to merrill
is a very clever girl she was edu-
cated in london

 then you speak english ex-
claimed merrill in that language

  yes but grandma doesnt now
and she reverted to german this is
what i have thought of course i
dont need to say again that you may
never come away alive you understand
that so we wont speak of it again
you must not go with me to-day no
listen i will go in as usual and while
i am there i will make my arrange-
ments for taking you in next wednes-
day afternoon i often go in on
wednesday meanwhile you will hide
here-that will be easy-and you will
trim your beard german fashion
grandma will give you some clothes
which belong to her son who is in the
army they will not fit but that will
not matter then we must think of
some reason why you are not in the
army that will come before wednes-
day also you will be well fed and
will feel like yourself

  it will help matters if you know
that once i am in strasbourg i can
find friends

  tell me nothing about that


strasbourg rose

  i would like to go to-day he
pleaded

  no was the positive response i
know better than you how are you
to get out of the cart in broad day-
light you must do as i say do you
know where the fraulein is

  in the illestrasse number ninety-
five

  perhaps i can bring you news of
her i dont know but i will try
now i must get ready i think
grandma he will be safe in pauls room
you must keep very quiet you un-
derstand i do not know your name

  my name is merrill if you should
see her tell her-

  it is not likely but if i see her
i will try to whisper a word now i
must hurry or i shall lose the good
market

  merrill trusted anna not only be-
cause he had no choice than to do so
but also because behind her direct mat-
ter-of-fact manner he was conscious
of a good heart and a good will

  when she returned late that night
she reported that she had passed the
house and had even made discreet in-
quiries but that she could get no in-
telligence that seemed to indicate that
rose was in the house he had desig-
nated she had learned however that
friedrich von sturm lived in the house
with hismother

  it was decided that he should play
the part of a soldier who had contracted
consumption in the trenches he
showed them how well he could imitate
the cough and how he could droop his
shoulders so that no one would suspect
that he was not what he pretended to
be and pauls clothes being too small
for him helped the effect at first
he had had qualms of conscience over
permitting them to take the risk of
smuggling him into the city but anna
had satisfied him on that score

  there is no risk she had said
frankly i wouldnt do it if there

were any i am glad to help you i
only hope you will escape with your
life the soldiers hate the americans
more than they have hated the eng-
lish

  she had arranged to spend the night
in strasbourg putting up her horse and
cart at a little inn from which it would
be easy for him to get away during
the night

 when wednesday evening came he
disposed himself in the bottom of the
cart not very comfortably indeed and
was covered over with the produce that
had been chosen for the purpose h
bade the old woman a hearty good-by
and promised her that if he ever
reached the american lines again he
would hunt up heinrich bohler and tell
him of his grandmother and his sweet-
heart

  the cramped ride was one merrill
was never likely to forget but he re-
alized before the cart went bumping
over the streets of strasbourg that he
would never have been able in any other
way to enter the city he quivered
with apprehension when the cart was
stopped at the outlying forts and at
each end of the bridge over the rhine

  the soldiers always attempted some
rough pleasantry with anna and he
marveled at the calm easy way in which
she answered them never losing her
serene dignity

  following annas instructions he
waited until the cart had been locked
in the yard for the night before he
crept out and stretched his eramped
and weary body fortunately it had
been dark before they reached the inn
so that he had not had long to wait
he rearranged the produce in the cart
and went into the stable where he slept
for the greater part of the night then
before any one was stirring he stole
out into the yard unlocked the gate
and slipped out

  so far all had gone well near by
was a square not much frequented even
strasbourg rose



in the daytime as anna had informed
him and there he went to remain until
daylight came

  she had given him instructions how
to find illestrasse and also how to find
the grosse metzig so that after he had
procured himself some breakfast with
money given him by the warm-hearted
old woman he set out to explore the
city always ready with his hacking
cough and drooping shoulders to im-
press any one who came along

  the day passed wearily but he got
through it somehow and without meet-
ing with any misadventure one most
peculiar thing struck him knowing as
well as he did german army discipline
-the officers were less arrogant than
he had ever seen them and the men
were more independent indeed the lat-
ter were at times actually impudent
from the german point of view

  he had found the grosse metzig
without difficulty early in the day and
had located the golden fleece the
latter wa a decent but lower-class beer
hall not unlike a french cafe in its
character

  at two oclock promptly be entered
the place and went to the table described
by saulnier there were few persons
in there and they paid no attention
to him he coughed a few times and
hung wearily over the table in order
to remain in character and when the
waiter came to him went through the
prescribed formula

  the waiter without a change of
countenance and as if having no com-
prehension of what had taken place
brought a glass of beer and set it down
in front of him saying carelessly it
is not only in beer that the old is better
than the new

  merrill sighed with relief i want
to get into communication with frsiu-
lein dalmeyrac he said in a low tone

  wait here the waiter answered
until a man comes and hails you as if
btb

he knew you and says you evidently
prefer old beer to new ask him if
he will have a glass of beer with you
and rap for me if i nod my head to
you you will know it is the right man
half an hour later an old wizened
man came into the place and on sight
of merrill hailed him like an old ac-
quaintance and sat opposite him the
waiter after bringing the beer ordered
nodded his head and left them

  you understand what i want
merrill asked

  yes we wont talk here ill take
you to my home

  when they were safely in the shabby
rooms occupied by the man and ht
aged wife the man spoke freely you
wish to see fraulein dalmeyrac it
will be difficult perhaps impossible but
i will see what i can do can you
give me any word that will help her to
know your mission she has to be
very careful

  if you tell her that hayden wishes
to see her i think it will let her know
all that is necessary can you tell me
anything about her is she well v

  she is very well but von sturm
is making it hard for her he has
sent his mother away and is threaten-
ing the fraulein

  threatening to give her to the
authorities 

  a fierce expression hardened the old
mans face he is threatening that if
she does not marry him he will do to
her as the germans did to the girls
of france and belgium

  merrill leaped to his feet in-an ac-
cess of sudden fury i will kill-him i
he breathed he isnt fit to live
thank god i am here he shall find
he has not only a weak girl to deal
with

  sit down my friend the old man
said kindly she is armed and can
protect herself besides there are
some of us here who wotrid give our
lives for her if that would help but


strasbourg rose

it is not so easy as that he has her
in his power because she doesnt dare
appeal to any one in authority besides
she is watched all the time

  there must be some way merrill
said

  we are trying to find that way one
of the maids is with us and she keeps
us posted now if you will remain here
i will go see what can be done i will
bring you word of some kind you
will be very careful if you please
where are you living

  nowhere i came into the city only
this morning

  are you french monsieur the old
man asked in that language

  no american i am a colonel in
the american army mademoiselle is
my betrothed

  ah cried the old man eagerly
then it was you who rescued her in
the-

  belgium interposed merrill yes
you know of that adventure

  yes pierre- did you know

jpierre rabeau 

  i was with mademoiselle when he
died in the chateau

  then it was you who shot von
sturm

  yes i am sorry i did not kill him
ah monsieur i am happy to meet
you yes mademoiselle will be happy
when she hears you are here you
will stay with me perhaps i cannot
offer you much but you will be safe
here yes you will stay with me it
is best and i will go now

chapter xxi

it has been arranged monsieur it has
been arranged the old man cried
eagerly when he returned two hours
later you shall see her ah she is
very happy

  merrill caught the old mans hand
and shook it energetically the thought
that he was actually to see rose again

unmanned him he patted the old man
on the back and laughed almost hys
terically

  i have found you a sister the old
man said humorously elsa mahler
is your sister and you are august
mahler you will go now to the house
you know it

  yes i passed it this morning
you will go there and ask for elsa
your sister you will have to kiss her
since you have not seen her for a long
time but she is very pretty you will
not mind

  i must not kiss her because i have
consumption and merrill gave a hol-
low cough

  the old man laughed as if the jest
were one of the best well it does
not matter only she will be glad to see
you and you must be affectionate-at
any rate when there is any one to see
she is one of the maids the one who
is of us and she will arrange for a
few minutes with mademoiselle

  it was with great difficulty that mer-
rill maintained anything like a calm ex-
terior when he presented himself at the
door of the house in illestrasse he
was hardly able yet to believe that
rose was alive so long had he been
convinced of her death

  elsa mahler lives here he said ap-
parently stifling a cough will you tell
her her brother august wishes to see
her

  he was taken into the kitchen where
he was curiously studied by the cook
and a maid while the maid who had
admitted him went upstairs to notify
elsa he coughed very effectively a
few times and sat in a listless attitude

  elsa a pretty lively girl of about
twenty came running in presently and
threw herself into his arms crying out
my poor august i see you once
again she kissed his cheek two or
three times ach how ill you are
come upstairs to my room you poor
boy he turned to the others and
strasbourg rose

once be was as strong and splendid as

you could wish come august turn-
ing to him again lean on me 
am strong please god i it is not far
to go

  elsa dear sister he coughed
painfully and leaned on her shoulder
i am not so bad i shall be well soon
again

  she glanced piteously at the others
and raised her eyes to show how well
she realized his self-deception yes
yes of course you will soon be well
you have a bad cold any one can see
that you can see that frau keppel
she appealed to the cook

  yes to be sure that is easy to see

  come upstairs then august and we
will have a good talk about old times
and when we come down frau keppel
will make you some coffee is it not
so

  naturally naturally  responded the
cook

  the two went out into the hall and
up the stairs elsa whispered to him
not a word to me just cough a little

  he was so excited that he trembled
but he contrived to cough at intervals
on the way up elsa talked to him in
coaxing tones as a woman does to a
sick person assuring him over and over
that soon he would be quite well again

  she ushered him into a small but neat
bedroom wait a few moments for
me she said softly and went out of
the room by another door which led
into a larger room he trembled so
that he was obliged to hold himself
steady by the footboard of the bed-
stead it seemed incredible that he was
to see her

  elsa returned in a very short time
and beckoned him to come into the
other room it also was a bedroom but
much larger and luxuriously furnished
she left him there and went into a
connecting room the next moment
he heard a rustle of skirts and rose

stood in the doorway staring eagerly
then they were in each others arms

  my darling my darlingie mur-
mured

  for a little while they did nothing
but cling to each other making demon-
strations of love and murmuring inco-
herently words of joy and happiness
it was rose who first roused herself

  we have such a short time dear-
est she said and it wont be wise to
try this again friedrich might sus-
pect elsa is the only one i dare trust
here there is much to talk of now
oh yes very much you are quite
well 

  i never was better the wound
looked more serious than it was and
you mon ami

  perfectly well and so happy that
i fee as if i could fly

  she smiled sadly i wish you couhl
fly dearest then you could take me
under your arm and we could get out
of this city and back to france that
is our trouble now-how to escape
we are planning and we think we may
be able to accomplish it but it will
be dangerous i cannot remain here
for friedrich becomes more a brute
every day

  merrill grew rigid as he remembered
what it was she had to fear from her
cousin i would strangle him i lv
could get my hands on him he said
hoarsely

  i can kill him she said quietly
but with a terrible menace in her tones
or at worst i can kill myself but
those are things to avoid for i wish
to live to be happy with you think
of the years we have been separated
dearest

  yes fate owes us much happiness
for the sorrow we have had but tell
me my darling why cannot i hide
myself in the house and have it out
with this scoundrel

  it may come to that but it is the
last resort everything would have to


strasbourg rose

be ready for our flight before that could

be done it seems almost an impos-
sibility anyhow the city is so well
guarded if it had not been for you
dear i dont think i could have en-
dured what i have all these years but
always it was in my heart that some
way i could let you know that i was
alive and that then you would come to
me and you are here

  i could not come sooner until i
was taken prisoner i could do nothing
but when that happened i knew the
time had come

  always wonderful she sighed ad-
miringly

  if i were wonderful i would find
some way of liberating you i am here
but i can do nothing

  do not be impatient mon ami our
friends are active a way will be
found affairs are going badly with
the army and the people all over the
country are ready for rebellion here
we are at work among the soldiers who
are very tired of the war when the
time comes we will know what to do
and in the meantime this beast of

a friedrich-

  yes dearest that is the one serious
danger but in some way that can be
avoided there is but one thing for
you to do-be patient and wait and
you must remain indoors by daylight
do you know who is commandant
here

  no i know nothing

  general von schilling

  oh  murmured merrill under-
standing at once what that meant

  yes and you know the eyes of hate
are sharp if he were to see you he
would recognize you and that would
be the end you will keq in hiding
will you not you shall hear from
me every day it may be only a word
but you shall hear from me

  at this moment elsa rushed into the
room in evident terror quick he
is coming she dragged rose into the

other room pushing merrill toward the
little room

  a few minutes later elsa came to
him in her room and bade him follow
her quietly i cannot take you down
through the kitchen she said because
there are two soldiers there creatures
of von sturms i will let you out by
the main door and you must hurry
away quickly i am afraid he sus-
pected something for he is in a furious
temper and is questioning her

  listen elsa he said i do not
like to leave her if there is any danger
for her can you not hide me in the
house

  my god no was her swift re-
sponse you will spoil everything
you must go she is in no danger now
come

  he followed her reluctantly his fin-
gers itching to take the wretch by the
throat and he felt as if somehow he was
deserting rose in her time of need
on the other hand his reason told him
that he would better accept the guid-
ance of her friends

  he got out of the house and at
elsas direction made his way as
quickly as possible to the first corner
where he turned there he was un-
expectedly met by the old man who was
his host

  i wasnt sure you could find your
way to my place he said i was up-
set i can tell you when i saw von
sturm with his two dogs of soldiers
go into the house he was not due
for an hour yet do you know what
he wanted 

  elsa said he seemed suspicious that
is all i learned

  yes yes of course so he is sus-
picious i must find out about that
i wonder what he is suspicious about
he seemed troubled and sent mer-
rill up to his rooms alone while he went
to make inquiries among his comrades
later he returned and said there was
no reason to believe von sturm had
strasbourg rose

any specific suspicions but that there
was manifest nervousness among all the
officers of the garrison

  for several days merrill remained in
hiding each day receiving some mes-
sage from rose sometimes written but
more often transmitted by word of
mouth

  word from rose was always hope-
ful however and she never failed to
assure him that friedrich remained re-
spectful even if more and more in-
sistent from old karl his host he
teamed that von sturm certainly had
suspicion of her having communication
with some one

  one day karl came home excited and
jubilant they had had news from a
sure source that rank mutiny had
broken out at kiel that the workmen
at essen and at other munition fac-
tories were on strike and that the people
all over germany were grumbling
moreover the soldiers of the garrison
were openly grumbling and that disci-
pline had almost broken down

  he went out immediately after din-
ner saying that merrill was to be ready
for action at a moments notice since
this was the time they had been waiting
for

  merrill could do nothing but pace
the floor and he was doing this when
he heard a trampling of many feet on
the stairs it was not a disorderly
sound however and his quick ear noted
its military quality

  the sounds stopped at the door of
their rooms and the next moment the
door was burst open and half a dozen
armed soldiers filed in followed by an
officer in whom merrill recognized von
sturm not the sturdy handsome offi-
cer he had seen before but a sallow
sickly man

  merrill sank into a chair as quickly
as jxssible and began to simulate tu-
berculosis something was wrong but
he hoped nothing more than a visit of
suspicion was involved and lie knew

karl kept nothing questionable in his
rooms

  where is karl welton  von sturm
demanded sharply

  he is not at home the old woman
quavered

  who is this man look at me pig

dgr

   merrill coughed but realized that his
best move was to act as if he had noth-
ing to fear he hoped that von sturm
had not seen him well enough at the
chateau to recognize him now espe-
cially with his beard he looked up
and von sturm studied him he
turned away to give an order and then
prompted by some memory turned back
and stared at merrill with growing rec-
ognition

  shoot that man if he makes a
move he cried seize him at once

  resistance under the circumstances
was worse than useless so merrill made
no movement but sat waiting

  so cried von sturm with an ex-
pression of joy it is you i had not
hoped for this now i understand
bring him along never mind anything
else this is enough for me a spy
he cried his voice trembling with
hatred ah we have a certain treat-
ment for spies tie his hands and if
he tries to escape put a bayonet through
him aha v and he snapped his fingers
in his delight i shall have news to
take home now

  a sickening sense of defeat over-
whelmed merrill but since an attempt
at escape could only mean his imme-
diate death he made no struggle when
his hands were tied behind him nor
did he answer a word to the malignant
taunting words of von sturm

  with a man on each side of him and
four behind he was marched through
the streets at this time crowded with
people ah the way he was taunted
by von sturm who never openly
mentioned rose but who suggested her
in every sentence
strasbourg rose

  he was taken to the citadel and there
thrown into a cell in the military prison
say your prayers von sturm cried
through the bars the gullet you will
receive will not let you live even as i
have lived since you treacherously shot
me and remember that now i have
a means to bring our little rose to her
knees oh i know what you are to
each other i have not been as blind
as i have seemed though i never ex-
pected to see you here wish me luck
wont you i am now going to hurry
home to rose

chapter xxii

tt needed no one to tell merrill that

  he was at a serious pass a most des-
perate pass indeed there would be
little difficulty in convicting him as a
spy he had been caught within the
enemy lines in civilian clothes that
in itself would have been enough but
in addition he had the venomous en-
mity of von sturm and worse than
all he had to reckon with the wounded
vanity of von schilling

  he might or might not be tried ac-
cording to the laws of war the ger-
mans paid little respect for any such
laws if he were tried he could plead
that he was an escaped prisoner and
therefore not a spy since his uniform
had been taken from him but even if
under ordinary circumstances such a
plea might have value he knew that
if von schilling recognized him his
doom was as good as pronounced

  he was too brave a man not to face
the facts and he was not long in de-
ciding that his end was near it was
not that that troubled him most his
thoughts were mainly on rose and how
she would be affected he thought of
her in the power of von sturm who
would now be goaded on to the worst
by his discovery of merrill

  he wondered miserably if he would
have done better to make a struggle

at the time of his capture perhaps
he could have taken von sturm to
death with him and so have freed rose
from his persecution a little reflec-
tion however told him that he would
have been shot before he could reach
him

  he sat on the side of the little iron
bedstead and went over and over the
possibilities until at last in utter weari-
ness after having traversed the ground
many times over he gave it up and
began to pace up and down the tiny
cell trying to compose himself so that
at least he could face the future with
the calmness and courage he wished to
preserve to the last

  his supper and his breakfast the next
morning consisted of not too large a
piece of black bread and water he
had hardly finished his breakfast when
a guard came to take him away he
was conducted into a large room in the
citadel where he found a court of mil-
itary officers sitting which meant that
he was to have at least the form of a
trial

  the first person he saw was von
sturm whose eyes glared at him fero-
ciously while his lips parted in a snarl
von schilling was not there at which
merrill sighed with relief at least it
was one vindictive enemy the less to
contend with

  the presiding officer after studying
him curiously for a few moments said
in a strikingly informal manner so
you are a spy eh

  no i am not i am an escaped pris-
oner i am an american officer i was
imprisoned at freudenstadt and es--
caped

  an american officer they all
stared at him in surprise what name
and rank

  colonel hayden merrill i was
captured in the argonne

  he is a liar broke in von sturm
a low laugh went around the court
he is a spy what is he doing here
strasbourg rose



if he is an escaped prisoner how
did he get into the city

  this is somewhat irregular said
the presiding officer lazily but you
might reply to the allegation and ques-
tions

  merrill had a sense of unreality in
the way the trial was being conducted
this was not at all as german officers
acted as a rule but whether there was
hope for him in their manner or if it
only meant that his case was already
judged and they were amusing them-
selves with him he could not tell

  i am not a spy i came to the city
because after wandering about the hills
until i was ragged and starving i knew
that where there are so many people i
could find some one kind enough to
give me food and clothe me after a
fashion i have not been near the forti-
fications nor have i even been much
about the city

  how did you get into the city we
always thought it difficult to pass the
guards unless one had a good excuse
i cannot answer yotf without getting
some one else in trouble i was helped
out of pure kindness

  he is one of a nest of spies von
sturm cried the city is full of them
they helped him get in they have
been plotting

  merrill seeing that he was carefully
keeping rose out of his talk only
smiled as he answered these are but
a crazy mans statements if he knows
these things why not prove them i
give you my word of honor as a sol-
dier and a gentleman that i am not
a spy

 and never have been demanded
von sturm

  and never have been

  you are a damned liar

  and you are a coward or you would
not insult a man who is powerless to
punish you

  proofs captain von sturm said
the presiding officer who seemed to

find von sturm ridiculous if you
have nothing more than mere assertions
we will communicate with freudenstadt
to confirm his statements and if they
are true to return him there

  merrills heart leaped it seemed he
was to escape once more from before
the very face of death he looked at
von sturm and iaw him hesitating as
if debating in his mind whether or not
to use rose in some way to accomplish
his end

  you know how and where i found
him he said finally after a sullen
silence if you think he has made
out a good case for himself it is fot
you to judge

  yes sharply it is for us to
judge he looked about at the other
officers and went on if his stoiy is
shown to be true he is not a spy colo-
nel merrill you will be taken back and

held until-

  he stopped and rose to salute as did
all the other officers for at that mo-
ment general von schilling opened the
door and came strolling into the room
he graciously waved them to sit down
and smilingly glanced about the room

  ah he said with that half-con-
temptuous smile that seemed to go with
speech of or to von sturm is this
captain von sturms spy

  merrills heart sank as the cold blue
eyes settled on him they gave no sign
of recognition however and it only
remained for him to be taken away
before his name was mentioned but
that was not to be

  yes excellency but captain von
sturm has produced no evidence and
the man claims to be an escaped pris-
oner from freudenstadt i was about
to return him to prison lo await word
from freudenstadt

  the general shrugged his shoulders
and turned away saying i suppose
so under the circumstances

  your story will be looked into colo-
nel merrill the presiding officer said


strasbourg rose

  what snapped von schilling
wheeling about and staring at merrill
who stood erect facing him

  a sudden silence fell on the room
everybody startled by the utter change
in the general he walked over to
merrill his eyes narrowed his head
thrust slightly forward he stared him
in the face for a few moments his
first expression of rage changing to one
of malignant hate so he said
slowly colonel merrill you are
sure it is not doctor merrill

  i am colonel merrill of the ameri-
can army i am not acting as a sur-
geon

  the general smiled evilly and turned
to the officers of the court this man
is a spy i know him to be a spy
you will sentence him to be shot and
he will be shot at once my orders
but general murmured the pre-
siding officer going toward his superior
in a deprecating manner and starting
to speak in a low tone

  you will do as i sav curtly inter-
rupted von schilling if you do not
i will take the responsibility on myself
the officer-he was only a major-
paled before the angry eye of the gen-
eral but he looked at his watch and
said it is after eleven excellency i
cannot do it

  merrill was dum founded he had
never seen anything like this before in
the german army and what had the
time of day to do with it 

  von schilling made a furious move-
ment of his arm as if to push the major
aside then he turned to the corporal
in charge of the men

  take this man into the yard and
have him shot at once

  tzu befelil murmured the corporal
and at a curt order from him his men
took their places beside merrill

  and said merrill his eyes fixed
on the face of the general all because
i one day tied up general von schilling
and hid him under a bed

  the officers had evidently heard the

story for they glanced at each other
with a startled look von schilling

caught the exchange of glances he
looked at them as if he would annihi-
late them and then strode furiously
toward merrill and slapped him in the

face

  pig dog he raged take him
away he ordered i shall be there
at once you understand 

  merrill with manacles on his wrists
was helpless to resent the insult but
his lips quivered as he turned his head
and addressed the officers who were all
standing in a group close together i
acquit you of this murder gentlemen
von sturm who had been a silent
and gloating spectator of the scene
broke into a laugh merrill did not
even glance in his direction but walked
away with his guard

  he was taken to the yard and placed
against the wall he refused to let
them bandage his eyes but stood calm
and erect his thoughts with rose he
had no hope of escape now if he had
had the faintest before

  von schilling stood apart his eyes
gleaming his face like chalk a squad
marched out and with the dull apa-
thetic faces of their kind drew up to
execute their orders

  they had raised their rifles when
there was a violent disturbance outside
the gate and above the noise was raised
the voice of a woman let me in
let me in they are going to shoot
him i know it

  merrill knew the voice at the first
word he forgot the threatening rifles
and looked eagerly toward the gate it
flew open and rose ran wildly in look-
ing about until her eyes fell on merrill
where he stood with his back against
the wall

  in another moment her arms were
about his neck the firing squad
grounded their arms mechanically von
schilling glared furiously at the gate
strasbourg rose



and then at the two lovers then a
thought flashed into his brain and he
leaped to where the lovers stood and
with a violent pull tore roses arms
from merrills neck and looked into her
face

  an expression of gloating triumph
distorted his face you too he
cried another spy he turned to
the firing squad shoot both of them
shut that gate

  rose turned and clasped merrill
about the neck again i was afraid
of this dearest she said at least
we now will go together

  shoot them as they stand vocifer-
ated von schilling shoot

  the rifles again came to firing posi-
tion but as merrill put his lips to hers
another command was heard

  stop dont shoot

  every eye was turned in amazement
to see from whom the new order had
come it had come from a man in
the garb of a common sailor he was
standing coolly in the gateway survey-
ing the scene his air one of perfect
assurance mingled with manifest pleas-
ure at the sensation he had created

  the phenomenon of a common sailor
appearing in that far inland city calmly
countermanding the order of a general
of the army struck von schilling into
a speechless fury he opened his lips
after a pause to roar out an order but
the sailor stepped into the yard and
pointed to a red band on his sleeve

  the war is over he cried the
german army has surrendered the
kaiser has abdicated and fled the revo-
lution is accomplished comrades the
people are the masters now you gen-
eral are a general no longer and
before the stupefied officer could com-
prehend or make a movement the sailor
approached him without haste and tore
the insignia of his rank from his coat
shouting long live the republic
the scene that ensued wras pande-
monium it was as if the soldiers had

been prepared for the astounding- news
they threw their guns on the pavement
and began to shout with joy they ran
about seeking the officers whose most
terrible orders they would have exe-
cuted a few minutes before and tore
from them their insignia of rank shout-
ing we are the masters now
come said a voice to rose who
still clung to merrill like one dazed
and unbelieving it was old karl who
spoke to her come quickly he
urged no one will notice you now
later they may remember and no one
knows what they will do

  rose recovered herself at once
come dearest she said

  my hands are manacled behind me
what does it matter laughed old
karl we can free you later

  they hurried out of the yard and
had no difficulty in getting out of the
citadel for all discipline was gone
when they were in the streets karl
led them away from the crowds that
now thronged the vicinity of the cit-
adel

chapter xxiii

it is like a dream or more yet like
magic rose said the war is
over the germans are beaten  alsace is
french again

  merrill sighed with content and
we are together when shall we be
married  there is nothing to hinder
now 

  oh la la mon ami she laughed
happily what a hurry you are in
i have hardly caught my breath yet
they were sitting comfortably in the
home of one of roses friends in stras-
bourg watching from the window the
throngs in the streets  throngs of quiet
and still subdued alsatians who were
hiding their happiness until the depar-
ture of the germans would make it safe
for them to express their real senti-
ments
strasbourg rose

  yes he said i am in a hurry
even now i am afraid of losing you
again for nearly four years we have
been playing hide and seek with each
other and now that i have found you
i am tired of the game and wish to
stop i want to put my mothers ring
on your finger and know that i have
you

  you have thought of that ring too
dearest i have carried it here lay-
ing her hand on her breast hoping
always that some time you would put
it on my hand again well i wont
pretend  i have been thinking of what
you would wish ever since yesterday
when we fled from the citadel you
remember that the first time we met i
gave you no choice but made myself
your wife now i shall leave every-
thing to you though i have something
in my mind to submit to you she
put her hand in his and smiled up at
him

  what is the something you know
i must rejoin my regiment now as
quickly as possible i may not be
needed there but it is my duty

  i had thought of that what is in
my mind is that we should be married
in paris i would like colonel le brun
to be there i can get a good automo-
bile here we can take elsa with us
and by starting very c rly in the morn
ing we can be u paris by night unless
the roads are crowded and as  know
the roads south of nancy i am sure
i can take a route that will not have
much traffic on it does it please you
dearest 

  it pleased him so well that twro days
later they were ushered into the pres-
ence of colonel le brun who discard-
ing all official dignity ran to them with
outstretched anns

  ah he cried after the first salu-
tations were over this terrible
american found you then he said
he would and i was sure it would hap-
pen and now what 

  we need you to make our happiness
complete merrill said

  here i am cried the colonel beam-
ing on them

  i have no parents my colonel rose
said blushing very prettily

  and i am to have that honor ah
my dear young lady how proud i shall
be and when

  well answered rose monsieur
says he must rejoin his regiment and
he refuses to leave mademoiselle dal-
meyrac behind

  aha ejaculated the quick-witted
frenchman but he would not so
much object to leaving madame mer-
rill he has my entire sympathy
to-night said merrill

  but these americans are swift
cried le brun ask the boches if
you dont believe me to-night that
will need arranging leave it to me
you need some clothes my friend
leave that to me also it is as good
as done you shall see that a french-
man is not slow when he really wishes
a thing done and with heart and soul
i wish this done

  it was done done so completely that
when the next day merrill left paris
for sedan where his regiment was he
kissed his wife good-by

  he was hailed by his regiment with
a joy that stirred him deeply he re-
ported to headquarters and as his regi-
ment had been supplied with a colonel
he was permitted a furlough of indefi-
nite duration

  he returned to paris in his uniform
very happy to be in it once more i
have a long leave of absence he said
after rose had admired him to her
hearts content is there anything you
would like to do or any place you would
like to go to 

  her eyes lighted up eagerly you
have something in your mind i won-
der if it is the same that is in mine
a little journey he suggested
to brussels and to bruges
strasbourg rose

  yes i shall never be quite happy
until i know that we brought no harm
to those good people there and do
you remember the girl anna bohler
who helped me into strasbourg i
must find her cousin and sweetheart
henry bohler and see that they meet

  and after these things have been

done she asked gayly

  by that time you will perhaps be
tired of me and will not mind if i put
myself under orders again and leave
you alone

  perhaps she said

the end

the parting

by charlotte mish

the woman threw herself into a chair with a harsh cry

charles you will not leave me

i am leaving to-night the man replied coldly now

    he started for the door but the woman barred his passage

    no no  she cried with passion you do not know what you are doing
you cannot leave me i could not go on without you

    you must my mind is made up i do not like to leave you you have
meant much in my life but-i must go

    the womans voice broke oh charles she cried you have been
mine for five years i cannot bear the thought that some other might have you
-will have you have you forgotten the first year you were mine she added
softly persuasively

     i have not forgotten he said flushing

    you were crude and young then she continued you were not the
man you are now do not forget that i have made you what you are-i now
that you have become famous you leave me for another she cried bitterly
remember it was i who watched the first work of your hands i who helped
you sympathized with your failures

     she searched his face with wild eyes for signs of relenting

    i have given you all i could-all i had say you will not leave me like
this

    the man spoke gruffly you think only of yourself true you have
helped me but now you only hold me down down down

    you will ruin me she cried when it becomes known that you have

left me for another-

    i am sorry for you but i must go he said firmly the call of higher
things beats in my ears dalmontigos offer me twice the salary you could ever
pay

    and the best chef madame bumetos quick-lunch shop had ever known
and whom madame had trained herself walked out of the place forever

r ray baker

you can earn two thousand dollars
by drowning yourself will
you have a cigar

  the proposition was advanced in a
matter-of-fact tone such a used by an
employer in stipulating a salary the
voice was harsh but benson would have
been disappointed if a pleasant sound
had emanated from between those dry
parchnientlike lips

  the squat hunchy figure leaned for-
ward in the armchair and an abnor-
mally long arm stretched out and
shoved a box of cigars to bensons side
of the table the wrinkled face of
the gnomish white-haired old man
showed yellow in the light of the desk
lamp and the eyes surmounted by one
grayrsh-brown eyebrow and magnified
by heavy-lensed spectacles held ben-
sons gaze with a revolting but irresist-
ible fascination

  bensons decision was not long in
eoming i accept your offer pro-

fessor aniesfield he said no
thank you i dont care to smoke
death was the inost alluring future
held out to the young man his ema-
ciated form hollow anaemic cheeks
and blue-veined hands foreshadowed
all too clearly that benson was destined
at a time not far remote to take that
long and mysterious journey unless
something were done quickly perhaps
in the way of a change of climate ben-
son knew this well enough but having
less than five dollars to his name he
could see no chance of a trip in quest
of health for five months he had been
without steady work and during that
time frequently he had lacked the ne-
cessities of life discouraged with
nothing beckoning except death he had
decided to hasten the inevitable and
was planning some inexpensive method
of suicide when he came across pro-
fessor amesfields newspaper adver-
tisement 
back to earth

i

  wanted-young man who doesnt
care what happens to him

  the professor rummaged in a drawer
of the table and produced a check book

  it is hardly probable he said in his
rasping voice that you would compre-
hend without considerable explanation
just what is expected of you how-
ever the mere fact that you answered
my advertisement is evidence that you
are the person for whom i am seeking

  i am writing a book on the sensa-
tions of death and i want you to help
me with the sensations of drowning
chapter to do this of course it will
be necessary for you to drown as
soon as you have taken leave of the
terrestrial sphere you must come back
to this room-your spirit i mean-and
relate to me the story of your death
the professor paused to help himself
to a cigar

  clear out of his head thought
benson as he watched the dwarf emit
a cloud of smoke either that or hes
making a poor attempt at a joke only
he seems to take it perfectly serious
the other divined his thoughts
this no doubt sounds beyond the
bounds of reason to you said ames-
field unless you have some knowledge
of theosophy spiritualism or others of
the beliefs concerning the immortality
of the soul however i assure you
that you will experience no difficulty in
performing your part of the contract
when once you find yourself on the
astral plane which is the world you
enter-sometimes called the fourth
dimension-when you pass through the
stage that is commonly known as death

  your task will be alleviated-it
would otherwise be well-nigh impossible
-by the fact that i possess psychical
powers being able to place myself in
a trance and communicate with disem-
bodied spirits however i have not
been able to get in the vibration of any
drowning victims so i am obliged to
make one you are to be that victim

  bensons theories concerning life and
death were vague his had been a
very material existence and he had not
worried about immortality there was
no question in his mind but that ames-
field was mentally unbalanced perhaps
as a result of overstudy however
there was no reason why he should not
see the thing through since paradoxi-
cally death was now his only object in
life

  make the check out to delia rem-
ington he directed i have no
relatives except an uncle whose where-
abouts are unknown and delias the
girl i expected to marry some day i
might as well leave her something to
remember me by something besides un-
pleasant memories

  benson scribbled a brief farewell
note and inclosed it with the check in
an envelope which he addressed and
placed in a pocket

  are you ready inquired ames-
field consulting his watch it is eight
oclock and there is little danger of in-
terruption at this hour of the evening
at the west side bridge let us hurry
as i am anxious to finish my manu-
script

  he left the room and returned with
a long rope which he coiled and thrust
partly into a pocket im going with
you he explained to see that the job
is done right

  half an hour later the two-age
who had lived and intended to continue
living and youth who had not yet lived
and was preparing to die-stood on the
bridge which spanned a narrow and
swift stream in the outskirts of town

  a silver curtain cast by the moon
danced on the current and everything
was still except for the swishing of the
water as it played about the piers with
tireless energy there was no traffic
at this hour as the bridge was fre-
quented only during the day by farmers
making their way to and from market

  the professor insisted on binding


back to earth

one end of the rope around bensons
arms and body and when this was done
he still retained a liberal length coiled
tn his hand

  the young man remembered the
check for delia

  will you mail the letter he asked
 forgot it and there isnt any stamp
on it either ill trust you to do that
for me its in this pocket

  amesfield took the envelope and
tlropped it in a pocket of his own over-
coat

  ii leave it at the post office on the
way home he promised it will go
out early in the morning mow lets
t this job over he took a turn
about the railing of the bridge with the
free end of the rope

  benson looked at the moon the
man in it appeared to be smiling the
jtars twinkled mischievously out of a
clear blue vault he wondered if after
ad it would be good to live perhaps
if be could get some kind of a job he
could go to colorado and there in the
altitude-------------

  hurry up admonished the pro-
fessor in that rasping inexorable voice
i havent all night to spend here

  benson took a deep breath and leaped
into the river his lungs filled with
water as be sank into the cold depths
but the rope jerked him back to the
surface he would have called out the
pressure on his lungs was so over-
powering but he was choking and
could not utter a sound his legs
thrashed about wildly and he longed
for the assistance of his arms no use
the professor had tied them securely

  if i could only swim groaned the
man who had wanted to die but whose
primordial instinct now made it im-
possible for him to give up trying to
live

  the current tossed him about merci-
lessly under the bridge the water
swirled around the piers in wild glee
d he thought be could hear the pro-

fessor joining m with a fiendish accom-
paniment

  why doesnt he let me go thought
benson why does he persist in hold-
ing me here under the bridge 

  dimly when his head bobbed above
the surface of the stream he could see
the shadows of the bridge which were
dancing on the ripples and apparently
beckoning him into the unknown

  he thought of the farm in michigan
where he had been born the picture
of his kindly faced hard-working
mother rose from the depths then
appeared his father dust-covered and
perspiring from a day of toil in the
fields he wondered if he would meet
them soon

  what was that ringing it must be
the bell of the greenwood church
which he used to attend every sunday
morning with his father and mother
it was there he had met delia the
church was crowded with stalwart sons
of toil and ruddy-cheeked women and
girls they rose holding hymn books
before them and began to sing their
voices dim at first increased in volume
until they blended in a mighty roar that
fairly crashed in bensons ears then
the chorus grew more indistinct he
had left the church and was walking
homeward through the forest-with
delia the singing continued from
afar

  benson realized that the current was
carrying him away from the bridge
the professor must have released the
rope he thought but he had ceased to
be interested in the professor or him-
self he was drowsy oh so drowsy
he was going to sleep

  the moon must have hidden behind
a cloud for everything had turned
black he was sinking into a vast
abyss where silence reigned there
were ncf bells no singing nothing but
blackness everywhere of a sudden the
realization came to benson that he was
no longer sinking he was rising he
back to earth



had come to the surface there was the

moon again bathing the river in a silver
sheen he experienced no physical
sensation save that of floating but he
appeared to be floating in the air the
river was beneath him

  a dark shape tossed about by the
current attracted his attention it was
a human body wrapped with rope it
was his own body or the one that had
been his a short time ago well let
it go he thought he had no further use
for it he had felt too closely con-
fined in it and besides the germs of
the white plague would have taken pos-
session soon

  thoughts of professor amesfield in-
truded on bensons feeling of content-
ment there was the contract as yet
unfulfilled and benson never had
broken a pledge

  no sooner had thoughts of the pro-
fessor come to benson than he found
himself in the formers library yes
there was the dwarf smoking a cigar
and waiting patiently he was seated
at the same table as when the drowning
contract had been made

  well i have come professor said
benson and amesfield nodded as he
expelled a cloud of smoke from his
lungs

  i knew you would come he re-
sponded are you ready to report

  yes benson answered and won-
dered that he could not hear his own
voice while the professors had been
perfectly audible

  amesfield picked up a fountain pen
and moved several sheets of paper
toward him proceed he directed
and seemed to sink into a doze

  it was like this benson began
at first when i sank beneath the
waves i struggled furiously due to the
law of self-preservation then as
more and more water entered my
lungs-

  so benson dictated the story of his
experience in the river and the pro-

fessor transcribed it as he talked
amesfield emerged from his trance and
looked over the manuscript with a kind
of gloating satisfaction

  it is entirely satisfactory he ob-
served the book is now completed
that is all you may go

  but benson lingered he was not
yet ready to leave and he did not relish
being dismissed so imperiously he
retreated to a corner of the room which
the glow from the desk lamp failed to
reach for the light had made him feel
uncomfortable it seemed to project
an unpleasant vibration in the dark
comer he was more at ease

  the professor put the manuscript in
a drawer of the table then he took
an envelope from his overcoat which
had been draped over the back of a
chair benson started that was his
letter with the check for delia the
professor had forgotten to mail it
evidently amesfield deliberately
ripped open the envelope and extracted
the contents he seemed undecided
for a moment then he tore the check
and note to shreds and tossed them into
the fireplace the envelope he thrust
into the drawer

  benson was enraged he tried to
call out to the professor but found it
impossible to attract the dwarfs at-
tention evidently amesfield had
reestablished the barrier between the
spirtual and physical worlds his rage
growing benson reached for a chair
with the intention of hurling it at the
psychologist but he was unable to
budge it the professor had broken
the bargain and benson was helpless
in his present state

  if i was only back on earth again
for a few moments i would show him
whether he could deliberately break
faith with me thought benson this
thought grew on him and he found him-
self back at the river looking for his
abandoned body

  but the body was no longer in the


back to takah

grip of the current it was in the
possession of a group of rough-looking
men on shore about a mile from the
bridge they were rolling it over a
barrel benson laughed why should
they bother about that body of his
when he himself had discarded it as
worthless curiosity prompted him to
examine the body and he found the
rope had been removed the face was
purple and the arms and legs dangled
grotesquely

  benson moved among the men and
even touched some of them on the
shoulder but they paid no attention
they had now placed the corpse on its
back and were pumping the arms
causing water to spurt from the mouth
a man carrying a medicine case ap-
peared gave the corpse a cursory
examination and remarked

  tm afraid hes done for well
have to hurry if we bring him through
he was in the water a long time

  all right doctor he was told

  still infuriated by the professors
treachery benson hovered close to the
body and mustering all his mental
force willed that he should reenter that
apparently lifeless form the effort
weakened him but he continued to con-
centrate his will on that one object
again he experienced a sensation of
drowsiness atid appeared to be sinking
into a pit with darkness reaching out
to engulf him he began to feel pain
indistinct at first but gradually grow-
ing more acute then came oblivion

  benson regained consciousness on a
hospital bed a nurse was standing
near by

  how do you feel she asked smil-
ing

  rather queer was his reply in a
weak voice i certainly had some
dream

  the white death was fought and van-
quished in the mountains of colorado
where fresh air abounded bensons

uncle died and unexpectedly left him
five hundred dollars which he used in
his search for a new lease of life after
a long battle during which benson lived
in a rude shack which he threw together
himself he visited the nearest large
city where a physician conducted a
thorough examination and pronounced
him physically sound

  into this crude shelter on the slope
of a mountain benson brought his bride
for their honeymoon she told him she
wanted to spend it on the spot where
he regained his health and she had
her way

  as he watched her pack her trunks
he noticed a small cloth-bound book
among her belongings

  whats that delia  he inquired
feeling an interest he could not explain
has some one been presenting you
with a volume of love lyrics 

  hardly she laughed reaching for
the hook some one sent it to me
that is true but i dont know who the
giver is its far from being poetry i
can tell you in fact it wouldnt sur-
prise me to learn it was written by a
lunatic i have kept the thing more
as a curiosity than anything else

  he took it and began to examine it
curiously when he saw the title he
nearly dropped the volume to the floor
the inscription on the cover was

the sensations of death

by prof a e amesfield

  benson had received a shock which
put him in a daze for a moment when
he recovered his composure sufficiently
he opened the book and the first thing
that his eyes rested on was the head-
ing of the last chapter his hands
shook as he read 

the sensations of drowning

  at first when i sank beneath the
waves i struggled furiously due to
the law of self-preservation then as
more and more water entered my
lungs-

chapter t

my name is richard judd i am
a traveling man in the dry-
goods and notions line with
opinions and a temper of my own and
when i landed in hillsdale junction
pennsylvania at four p m one rainy
friday afternoon-the date was the
thirteenth of september  as i see
by my diary-after a tedious journey by
a way train and found the business
places mostly closed on account of a
rival attraction-a cheap juggler show
at the town hall-well i quit whole-
sale dry goods drumming for the time
being and devoted a few minutes to a
wholesale job of cursing

  it was an utterly futile task and in
wretched taste besides but the tempta-
tion was great and i yielded i anathe-
matized the weather consigned the jug-
gler troupe to a climate considerably
warmer than that of their native land
swore at the mud which was ankle-
deep in the streets and cursed the luck
btb

which would probably keep me in that
out-of the-way place over sunday in-
stead of allowing me to get away on
an early train in the morning as i had
planned to do

  and then when i reached the eagle
house-the only hotel in the place-
and found every room except no 
taken by the troupe of jugglers i be-
gan afresh and aired my entire vocab-
ulary of swear words once more not
forgetting to include the hotel with its
miserable accommodations in my male-
dictions this time this also was sheer
foolishness since it was not the fault
of the hotel proprietor that i happened
to strike the town at the same time with
a troupe of traveling showmen but
this only shows how unreasonable i
had become

  in truth my frame of mind at that
moment was far from an enviable one
i am not any more superstitious than
lots of other traveling men but i made
tip my mind right away that i would
i

room 

not occupy room no  if i could
possibly help it i had encountered
enough bad luck on that trip without
further tempting fate by occupying
room  on a friday night-and the
thirteenth of the month at that the
landlord kept protesting that room 
was the only vacant sleeping apartment
he had left but i soon found a way
of getting over the difficulty slipping
a five-dollar bill into his hand i said
room  is the room i want just
move mr jugglers things into no 
send my sample case and grip up to
no  give me the key to the room
and ill stand between you and all dam-
ages what does a hindu juggler-
i had been told that the troupe were
hindus-know about numbers one
room or one number is the same as
another to him if he does happen to
complain you can send him to me ill
buy him off with a nickel

  ill do it said the landlord tucking
the bill into his vest pocket but i
think i had better tell the hindus that
you engaged room  in advance and
i had forgotten about it that prob-
ably will satisfy them they are a bad-
looking lot and i dont want to get into
any trouble with them or have you get
into any

  dont worry yourself a particle
about me im able to take care of my-
self all right said i jauntily go
ahead and tell the black-and-tan
heathen any story youve a mind to
and if they dont like it let them do
the other thing

  i am quite aware of the fact that
this was not the proper spirit to dis-
play toward a lot of fellow human be-
ings who clearly had as much right in
the hotel and more right to room 
than i but the weather and everything
had conspired to upset my plans and
spoil my temper and besides i was
younger then than i am now we
traveling men who circulate around and
see the world i find grow in wisdom

and toleration for others as we grow
older

  it stopped raining along toward dark
and after supper-dinner in that sec-
tion of the country is served at noon-
with the key of room  safely de-
posited in my pocket i went out for
a stroll around the town thinking per-
haps i might drop in and get acquainted
with one or two of the merchants with
whom i proposed to do business in the
morning

  but luck was still against me the
show at the town hall was still running
-sort of continuous performance for
the afternoon and evening i was in-
formed-and everybody i wanted to see
was attending it

  as i idly drifted about i heard many
comments on the show the people
who had been at the hall during the
afternoon seemed to be unanimous in
the opinion that the feats of the jugglers
were something really remarkable the
proprietor of the little cigar store which
i visited for the purpose of replenish-
ing my stock of havanas was quite
enthusiastic as well as communicative
over what he had witnessed

  why say stranger he exclaimed
them fellers can do anything except
killing a man and bringing him to life
agin and i aint so plaguey sure they
cant do that and old rham chunder
as they call him is the boss juggler
of em all i could set and watch him
for a week and not get tired id been
at the show yet if i hadnt promised a
friend of mine id meet him here to-
night why dont you go down to the
hall stranger and take it in youll
find it well worth seeing

  that may be said i but i dont
think i care for any juggler perform-
ance to-night id rather sit here and
smoke and play euchre for the cigars
whats a juggler show compared to
juggling with the pasteboards

  now youre talking exclaimed the
cigar dealer youre the veiy chap
room 

im looking for my friend will be
here in a minute and well have a three-
handed game and the one who comes
out last each time will have to buy the
cigars for the other two

  the friend showed up on time and
the evening passed off very pleasantly
soon after ten i got up paid my score
and set out for the hotel with my
pockets filled with cigars the most of
which by the way i had paid for my-
self

  well yon got me in a nice scrape
was the salute i received from the land-
lord upon entering the hotel office
room  belonged to the head divil
of the hindus and he wouldnt listen
to any explanation he is upstairs
now standing by the door of the room
and waiting to see you about it he
looks ugly too and im afraid he will
be up to some mischief unless he gets
his room back youd better let me
have the key and ill go up and apolo-
gize and have his things moved back
into no  and yours into 

  mnary a move said i with a forced
laugh mill interview old waxworks
myself

  i was not particularly anxious to see
him but i was in for it and i thought
i might as well put on a bold front
so striding out into the hall i ascended
the stairway and approached the door
of room  but when i reached it
i found my further progress blocked
by an ebony statue

  motionless in front of the door with
folded arms and head held defiantly
erect stood the burly form of the
hindu dressed in the typical costume
of his race

  ees zis meester judd he inquired
as i halted before him

  it is and i would like to enter
my room if you will be so kind as to
stand aside said i

  ah but zis ees not your r-room
said he zis ees my r-room and no
 ees yours ees it not

  here said i take these cigars
and dont bother me any more old
chap i want to go to bed

  he stretched forth his hand in silence
and took the half a dozen cigars i
offered him held them extended at
arms length a moment while he re-
peated some meaningless incantation
and then with an angry gesture he flung
them to the floor

  look he exclaimed pointing
zare ees meester judds see-gars
zey fraid an run away

  i glanced down the cigars had dis-
appeared and in their stead six snakes
with heads erect were rapidly gliding
away down the hall

  very good commented i sneer-
ingly but i cant stay up the rest of
the night to see you go through all
your tricks of jugglery i have already
had my moneys worth here is the
regular admission fee and now if you
will allow me to pass into my room i
shall be greatly obliged to you

  i held a quarter toward him and he
gravely took it twisted it up in his
fingers as if it had been made of lead
then sent it spinning to the darkest cor-
ner of the hall the next instant a big
bat sprang up from the comer where
the coin had landed and came blunder-
ing down the hallway almost brushing
against my face as it passed me i
heard its wings flapping until it reached
the farther end of the hall and then
there was a sound as of a coin jingling
on the floor and the flapping suddenly
ceased

  pity you havent a larger audience
said i still sneeringly it is too bad
to waste your talent on me especially
as i am not at all impressed by it ive
seen pretty fair magicians before i met
you herrmann or kellar could either
of them beat anything youve done
yet

  alrite meester i waste no more
tal-ent ze nex treeck i do meester
i

room 

judd remember i tink and his white
teeth showed in a grin that sent the
cold shivers racing up and down my
spinal column

  i didnt more than half like his looks
at that moment and it struck me that
it would be prudent to give in and end
the dispute without further arousing his
resentment

  ah  said he i see meester judd
is afraid he vill now gif up ze room
what belongs not to him eh 

  i flushed hotly at the imputation of
cowardice and decided now to stand
my ground at all hazards as i re-
marked before i was several years
younger then and less prudent perhaps
than i am now

  i shall not give up my room on
account of your hocus-pocus or veiled
threats my deft-fingered friend said
i angrily and you might as well un-
derstand it first as last i have the key
to room  and i propose to sleep
there if the devil flies away with me
before morning i almost wish he
would anything to get out of this
hole r

  alrite meester shall haf his vish
pass on ze room is yours and with
folded arms and face as impassive as
that of the sphinx the swarthy figure
stepped aside and allowed me to pass

  thank you said i with mock po-
liteness and then unlocking the door
i entered the room carefully closing
and locking the door behind me ten
minutes later i was in bed and-no
not asleep somehow i found it much
harder than usual to compose my mind
to slumber that night as a rule i drop
to sleep as soon as my head touches the
pillow but instead of doing so upon
this occasion i fell to thinking of the
tall hindu and wondering if he had
gone to bed in room  or whether
he was still standing on guard outside
my door i imagined i could hear
him breathing and once or twice i

was almost sure i heard the sound of
whispering in the hall

chapter ii

it must have been an hour before my
faculties quieted down and i finally
fell asleep and even then my rest was
broken by strange dreams in which my
friend the hindu juggler played a
prominent part

  twice i awoke with a sudden start
and sprang up in bed listening intently
but the only sound i heard was the
furious thumping of my own heart
each time before i awoke i seemed to
feel that there was some one in the
room but as soon as i was fully awake
this feeling would gradually pss off
leaving me in a cold sweat and weak
as an infant

  the second time i was awakened in
this way i waited until the feeling of
alarm had subsided then i got up and
striking a match looked under the bed
and in every comer of the room but
discovered nothing i also examined
the fastenings of the door and found
them just as i had left them

  hang the infernal juggler said i
to myself hes got me as nervous
and scary as an old woman but im
going to do some sleeping the rest of
the night in spite of him and i
plunged into bed once more and rolled
over on the pillow and slept like a
saw log until daybreak the next morn-
ing

  the first thing i noticed when i
awoke was that the ceiling of the room
looked strangely low apparently it
had dropped down about two feet dur-
ing the night

  thats queer said i stretching my
hands up toward it and then i noticed
another strange thing the shirt sleeves
in which my arms were incased were
of faded blue flannel and not overclean
at that instead of the dainty linen i
had worn upon retiring
room 



  great scott i ejaculated spring-
ing out of bed and staring wonderingly
around a room in which everything was
strange to my vision the bed the lo-
cation of the window and door the
furnishings all were different from that
of the room in which i had gone to
sleep the night before

  upon retiring i had hung some of
my garments up and piled the rest in
an orderly manner on a chair near the
bed now in place of them in a
tumbled heap on the floor beside the
bed lay a ragged and dirty suit of
clothes a slouch hat and a pair of
coarse shoes

  i looked for my sample case and
grip they were gone

  i glanced into the small mirror over
the mantel but i hardly recognized the
face that i saw there as my own i
had omitted to shave the day before
and the red stubble on my chin and
cheeks combined with the dingy flannel
shirt and unbrushed hair made me look
more like a tramp in hard luck than
a respectable and prosperous traveling
man

  well soliloquized i that con-
founded juggler has shunted me off into
room  all right but he might at least
have left my things alone

  i looked around for a call bell con-
necting with the office but finding
none i began thumping on the door
with my fist thinking to attract atten-
tion in that way and after a long time
as it seemed to me i succeeded in
doing so

  some one came grumbling along the
hallway halted at the door upon which
i was pounding and sung out

  well whats wanted inside there
and who the dickens are you any-
how 

  fl am mr judd and i want to see
the landlord of this establishment at
once i replied somewhat testily

  well here i am open the door

if you want to see me said the voice
outside

  i unbolted and flung open the door
and there before me stood not the man
i expected to see but a perfect stran-
ger with a look of astonishment and
inquiry on his face

  you are not the person i asked for
said i with as much dignity as i could
command under the circumstances clad
as i was only in my native modesty
and a blue flannel shirt which had evi-
dently been made for a much shorter
man than myself i wish to see the
proprietor of this hotel of whom i
hired room  last night

  i am the proprietor of the hotel
replied the stranger brusquely and i
never let a room to you or saw you
before in my life besides this is not
room  but  and now i would
like to know who you are and how
you got here if you are a tramp you
are not a very shrewd one to attempt
a game of this sort unless you are look-
ing for free board and lodgings in his
majestys prison

  his majestys prison echoed i
blankly where am i anyhow i
thought pennsylvania belonged to the
united states

  so it does i believe was the re-
ply but you are a good ways from
pennsylvania my friend this is
queensville crossing canada and the
room you are occupying is no  in
the royal lion inn and now id like
to be paid for your nights lodging and
receive an explanation as to how you
came here

  as to that i am as much in the
dark as you are said i earnestly i
went to sleep last night in room 
in the eagle house at hillsdale junc-
tion pennsylvania and i supposed i
was in the same hotel yet though scfae
one has played a smart trick on me
by exchanging clothing with me and
shoving me into another room while i
was asleep


room 

  the man frowned ominously

  come come he said that yam
of yours wont wash you might as
well get on the rest of your clothes and
hi call in an officer and have you taken
before a magistrate and let you tell your
story to him that is unless you can
pay for your lodging and give a better
account of yourself come make up
your mind quick what youre going to
do

  i was too dazed to make any reply
the more i tried to grasp the situation
the more hopelessly confused i became
my mind seemed to stagger and reel
like a drunken man a blank black
wall had suddenly closed in around me
and i was left groping in darkness
am i going mad i asked myself
or is this only a horrible dream

  come look alive in there shouted
the man at the door get your clothes
on and come along

  mechanically i began dressing myself
in the tattered garments piled by the
bedside when i had finished i opened
the door and stepped into the hail
where the landlord was awaiting my
appearance

  he led the way to the office adjoin-
ing the barroom on the first floor and
in silence i followed him the location
of the stairway the plan of the ground
floor the size of the rooms in short
everything about the place was entirely
different from that of the hotel in which
i had retired to rest the night before
stunned as i was i noticed all this
though strange to say it excited no
wonder in my mind my intellect had
fallen into such a state of hopeless be-
wilderment and helplessness that it was
no longer capable of anything except
blind submission

  an officer was called in and my
pockets were searched but i made no
protest i accepted the indignity as a
matter of course as a penalty which
had been imposed upon me by circum-

stances and which i was powerless to
avert

  questions were showered upon me
but i was too dazed to answer intelli-
gibly or even fully comprehend their
import as in a dream i saw faces sur-
rounding me and heard voices address-
ing me but that was all i did not
realize what was said nor attempt to
reply

  it was only when the officer placed
his hand upon my shoulder and in harsh
tones ordered me to come with him that
the spell was broken then with a
sudden thrill of terror i awoke to a
realization of the fact that i was under
arrest but for what crime what
had i done so far as i knew i had
committed no overt act yet here i
was in the grasp of the law like a
common criminal the shock brought
me to myself my dream was over
the time for action had come

  unhand me i cried i will not
submit to arrest without a warrant
what is the charge against me i de-
manded turning to the landlord i
have committed no crime last night
i retired to rest in a certain room in
a hotel in the state of pennsylvania
this morning i find myself stripped
of my rightful clothing and baggage
in an entirely different room in this
hotel which you tell me is located in
the dominion of canada i have no
idea how i got here but i wish to warn
you that i am a citizen of the united
states and-

  never mind that interrupted the
officer i cant waste time listening
to such a mess of nonsense you can
tell the rest of it when you get into
court

  i can obtain confirmation of my
story if you will allow me to send a
message to the landlord of the eagle
house at hillsdale junction pennsyl-
vania and i would also like to wire
for funds to my employer in phila-
delphia
room 



  the magistrate will settle all that
come on he again placed his hand
on my shoulder but i shook it off and
springing aside seized a heavy chair
and raised it threateningly over my
head

  stand back and allow me to leave
this room or i will brain you i
shouted advancing toward him i was
desperate and meant just what i said

  the officer hastily stepped back to
avoid my fierce onslaught and as he
did so his heel caught on a projecting
nail or splinter in the flooring and he
toppled backward and went down with
a crash measuring his length on the
floor and the next instant i had
dropped the chair bolted through the
nearest door and was off down the
street

  i had covered an entire block before
the discomfited officer reached the
street and started after me but he
raised such a hue and cry that he soon
had half a dozen pursuers at my heels
to give them the slip if possible i
turned down a steep side street and
ran swiftly toward a railroad track
which i saw before me only a few rods
distant i could hear a train approach-
ing and i remember thinking that if
i could get across the track ahead of
the train it would cut off my pursuers
for a time and give me an opportunity
to hide from them or perhaps escape
altogether

  it was a desperate chance as the
train was not more than two hundred
feet from the crossing when i first
caught sight of it but i determined to
try it

  with an almost superhuman burst
of speed i fairly flew over the ground
until i reached the track then i stum-
bled and fell in front of the oncom-
ing engine an unearthly shriek
sounded in my ears i felt myself flying
through space--and then everything
grew blank

chapter iii

yyhen i again recovered conscious-
ness i found myself in bed in a
partially darkened room with aching
bones and muscles and a stiffness
throughout my body and limbs as if
i had been thoroughly pounded by a
professional pugilist

  hello old man i guess youre all
right yet exclaimed a familiar voice
as i opened my eyes and looking up
i recognized the landlord of the eagle
house at hillsdale junction pennsyl-
vania and realized that i was back in
my old room once more

  yes hes all right said a voice
on the opposite side of the bed all
he needs now is plenty of rest and
good care for a few days but you will
have to keep a little watch for the pres-
ent to see that he doesnt wander off in
another fit of somnambulism

  all right doctor ill attend to that
replied the landlord and a few mo-
ments later the physician packed up
his drugs and instruments and with
a cheery good-by took his departure

  after he had gone i turned to the
landlord and asked what day of the
week it was

  sunday he replied

  and ive been here since friday
night have i

  part of the time-yes

  i know and the rest of the time
i was in canada but now the question
is how did i get there and how did
i get back here again 

  im sure i dont know what you
are talking about said the landlord
you havent been out of this town-
ship let alone in canada your mind
appears to be somewhat muddled yet
but i dont wonder at it after what
youve been through perhaps id bet-
ter call the doctor back to give you
a soothing draft

  no dont do that but please tell
me all that has happened since friday
i

room 

night what has become of the
hindus have they gone

  yes they left with their baggage
on the first train saturday morning
right after breakfast as their train
passed the crossing by smiths brick-
yard the workmen in the yard saw a
man spring in front of the train where
he was struck by the engine and rolled
down the bank into the ditch he was
picked up at once and carried into mr
smiths office and a doctor was sum-
moned in the meantime my chamber-
maid had reported that you were miss-
ing from your room and as soon as i
heard of the accident at the brickyard
i went down there and at once recog-
nized you in spite of your being dressed
in a coarse dirty suit of clothing such
as a tramp might wear

  the garments you had on were
soaked as if you had been out wan-
dering about in the rain the most of
the night though for that matter they
might have got wet from your tumble
into the ditch as i understand it was
partly filled with water at the time of
the accident

  upon recognizing you i had you
brought back to your room of course
and before opening your eyes a few
minutes ago you had been lying here
unconscious just twenty-four hours it
was a sort of cataleptic spell brought
on by great exhaustion followed by
sudden shock the doctor says but you
are all right now and will be on the
road again as lively as ever inside of a
week and now while i think of it
why did you speak a few minutes ago
of being in canada had you been
dreaming of being there 

  yes it was either a dream or what
is more probable a case of bedevil-
ment on the part of that boss hindu
you had here you know i beat him
out of his room friday night but he
evidently evened up matters by hypno-
tizing me and putting me through a
mighty thrilling and disagreeable series

of adventures-all imaginary of
course but which seemed as real to me
from first to last as anything i ever
experienced in my life

  i then went on and gave the landlord
a full account of the scene between
he juggler and myself before i had
retired on friday night of how i had
wakened-as it seemed to me-the next
morning in a strange room in a strange
hotel of my interview with the pro-
prietor and final arrest of my desper-
ate attempt to escape ending in being
struck by the train and losing con-
sciousness

  and now said i in conclusion
how do you account for it all  did
my hindu friend to punish me send
my astral body on a trip to canada
or did he simply hypnotize me and
cause me to imagine i had been there
and finally how do you account for
the old clothes in which i was dressed
when picked up and how did i get
out of this room and down to the rail-
road track a half mile away without
being seen by any one until just as
the train struck me

  its all a mystery give it up
remarked the landlord sen tent iously
and after considerable hard thinking i
was reluctantly compelled to do the
same

  but a few days later when i was
on the road once more some sudden
impulse moved me to write and send
the following message

landlord royal lion inn queensville

  crossing canada

  did strange man in blue flannel shirt and
coarse suit occupy room  at your hotel
night of th inst  answer by mail care
syndicate drygoods and notions company
philadelphia	richard judd

  i had no expectation of receiving any
reply unless perchance the telegraph
company might take the trouble to no-
tify me that my message was unde-
livered on account of there being no
such hotel in queensville crtssing
room 



 but strange to relate when i reached
 philadelphia a week later i found a
 letter from the landlord of the royal
 lion inn awaiting my arrival this is
 what he wrote me

                    royal lion inn
            queensville crossing canada
            september  

   deak sm party described by you oc-
 cupied room  on the night you mention

 not registered found him in room next
 morning no idea how he got there had
 him arrested as suspicious character escaped
 from officer later and mysteriously disap-
 peared-without settling hotel bill last
 seen running across railway track in front of
 train if you are a friend of his please
 remit one dollar for nights lodging and
 oblige yr obedient servant

j bracdon

    p s-the police officer and everat other
  reliable witnesses all say they saw the en-
  gine strike the party in question fairly and
  squarely as he ran in front of the train
  after breaking away from the officer but
  not a sign of him either dead or alive could
  be found after train had passed and the
  railway officials report no one having been
  killed or injured on the line that day i am
  curious to learn how your friend if friend

he is managed his get-away so cleverly
any explanation you can furnish along with
the dollar will be gratefully received

j b

  i sent on the dollar-minus the ex-
planation

  indeed what reasonable explanation
could i offer no one outside of the
booby hatch would believe me if i re-
lated the unvarnished truth regarding
my interview or rather dispute with
the hindu juggler and what happened
to me afterward

  the facts as i recall them are seem-
ingly incredible even to myself yet i
am fully convinced that they occurred
just the same exactly and precisely
as i have here set them down but
when i try to figure out just how that
confounded juggler managed his little
hocus-pocus prestchchange act of
which i was the unwilling victim i
find myself up against a blank wall
with no scaling ladder handy and the
solution of the mystery as far away as
ever

success

ouccess is the beacon of every young man who possesses enough energy to

    have the right to call himself a man but no real man ever succeeds there
is always a greater goal beyond

    to those who will there is always the consciousness within that tells them
how much better they might have done this is a sign of growth

    no matter to what height yon climb look ever beyond and above you will
be a miserable scapegoat if you reach a place where you can be thoroughly
content

    i know a man who became signally successful in business he wished to
retire in fact did so what happened he found himself stagnating his
mind was going to sleep his body was withering away

    what did he do

    he went back into his old business at the age of sixty and to-day is the
possessor of a second fortune he is now seventy-two

 corday

francois de vallient

paris march  

i shall assassinate monsieur cle-
menceau tiger of france i
do not wish to do it but ever since
my father on his deathbed gave me
the poniard of charlotte corday
handed down in my family since it was
secreted by my ancestor who helped
in her arrest i have felt an inordinate
desire to kill men in high places i do
not understand this obsession my
whole soul revolts against such crime
but i am in the hands of a fate i can-
not control i am writing this diary
to exculpate myself in the eyes of the
world should i do this most foul mur-
der upon a man whom i love and re-
spect

paris march  

  i have seen him-monsieur clemen-
ceau-and hate hate with the hate of
the damned yet i know that in my
innate soul i do not hate but am im-
pelled to the emotion by irrevocable de-
cree perchance it is the curse on the

dagger pronounced by charlotte when
she slew marat in his bath i do not
know god save me from this deed

paris march  

  to-day i bought a dummy figure of
life size such as are used in windows
of clothing shops to display garments
as they would appear when donned by
men i spent two hours hollowing out
the left breast of the dummy this
hollow i filled with a huge boneless
ham smoked until it almost was black
first i trimmed it to fit into the hollow
exactly as a carpenter might dovetail
a joint of wood before i chose the
ham as a medium i had considered and
discarded as impracticable such fillings
as cement plaster or putty nor was
beef acceptable i chose the ham be-
cause it will last longer without putre-
fying for two hours more i prac-
ticed thrusting charlottes poniard into
this fleshy breast having first covered
it with cloth painted with lines to rep-
resent human ribs and outlining behind
the poniard of charlotte corday



the ribs the exact location of the heart
i wish to make sure of my aim when
i strike monsieur clemenceau shall
die

paris march  

  forty times out of forty-five i struck
with unerring precision straight be-
tween the diagrammed rib marks into
the heart of my dummy but this is
not sufficiently accurate i must be
more expert letter-perfect in my
thrust at the heart strange but even
with all this thrusting and despite my
effort to polish the poniard blade a spot
remains upon it it seems like a rust
spot but i surmise it is the blood
of marat which dried into and re-
mained on the weapon otherwise it
is as bright and keen sharp-pointed
and deadly as when it bit the heart of
cordays victim

paris march  

  monsieur clemenceau dies to-mor-
row to-day i struck true every time
i thrust with the poniard i have ar-
ranged with monsieur gaston boudi-
noir for an interview with the tiger
little does he dream what awaits and
yet-i wonder at my calm cruelty and
deliberate preparation i find myself
hating myself for the dastardly thing
i am about to do it is the curse of
charlotte corday on the poniard it
can be nothing else than this curse
which drives me to do this foul deed

  etienne desmorts frowned as he read
these entries in his diary he shook
his head

  it is not enough  he muttered i
must practice more-with my dummy
clothed i had not thought of that

  desmorts closed his diary rose from
his desk and secreted the little book
of memoirs in a closet built into the
wall from the closet he produced a
coat somewhat the worse for wear
with this he went to the dummy stand-
ing in a comer near the window of his

room without much difficulty he ad-
justed it on the form then sniffed as
an odor of decaying meat greeted his
nostrils

  i must get another ham he mut-
tered with a grimace this one-

he shrugged

  desmorts was a dapper little french-
man not more than five feet five inches
tall but every inch of him steely muscle
his brown eyes were more nearly black
the dainty mustache of an exquisite
adorned his upper lip his wavy hair
of raven hue surmounted a high fine
forehead and a face almost spirituel
in its delicacy etiennes small ears
were set high his teeth which his lips
had bared in grimacing were in two
perfectly aligned rows which evidenced
scrupulous use of a brush his hands
were small but strong

  as he picked up the poniard which
had been charlotte cordays and pre-
pared to strike through the coat at the
dummys breast the knuckles of his
right hand were white with the tension
of his powerful grip on its hilt step-
ping to one side desmorts lunged with
the dagger it sank deeply into the
flesh of the ham etienne withdrew
the blade and opened the coat

  ah- he murmured perfect 

  in the painted-cloth diagram was a
fresh cut cleanly made between two
picture ribs and into the heart etienne
closed the coat and struck at it again
and again from every possible angle-
upward downward from left from
right and obliquely for each time he
hit he opened the coat to inspect the
wound he had made in the diagram
it was a slow tedious process nor was
it light labor etiennes brow was glis-
tening with perspiration and his hair
was matted on his forehead

  forty true hits out of forty-one
he totaled ecstatically no need to
delay longer i neednt buy another
ham either

  blithely he washed then sprayed co-
io

the poniard of charlotte corday

togne in the air from an atomizer so
that the stench of decaying ham no
longer was noticeable in the apartment

  no need for delay he repeated
to-morrow-i strike to-day-now
-a stroll on the champs

  etienne desmorts carefully locked
the door of his room one of many in
the pension des messieurs whose front
faced on the new rue les croix de
guerre sauntering down a narrow
corridor to a stairway he descended
two flights into a long- hall leading to
the exit of the big lodging house

  his heart was light within him a
smile in his eyes he ogled many a
pretty girl as he strolled the champs
elysees many a sweet smile he re-
ceived in return for etienne had a win-
ning way which few women could re-
sist but his smiles were more from
force of habit than from an immediate
desire to arrange an assignation his
hand must be steady his purpose must
not be disturbed by wild indulgences
which might cause nervousness after-
ward-if he were successful and es-
caped-he could enjoy life as he would

  no man looked less the assassin than
did etienne desmorts as he gayly prom-
enaded greeting with a smile every ac-
quaintance and friend who changed to
cross his path it was evident from
their cordiality that he was a general
favorite even among men

  in a cafe he sat at a table and sipped
absinth disguised with red wine for
although a ban has been placed by
france upon the sale of absinth the
law is winked at and made a national
mockery despite etiennes determina-
tion to avoid whatever might unnerve
his hand the absinth was so palatable
and his mental strain was so great that
one glass led to another-another-a
fourth ere he realized he must cease
such madness on the eve of his great
enterprise

  yet another glass he imbibed-to
steady himself as he argued in excuse

but this glas began to make etienne
fed exuberant he was on the thresh-
old of an achievement which would rid
him forever of the curse on charlottes
poniard one stroke of its keen blade
would end the haunting spell it had cast
upon him clemenceaus blood must
flow that other fool who had tried
to assassinate the premier with bullets
had been careless evidently he had
not practiced as had etienne for the
ordeal else the task would not have
been left for another who held no hate

 but desmorts did hate-for so he
had written but it was not a per-
sonal hate it was a hate inspired by
charlotte cordays poniard he dwelt
upon this point insistently until his
thoughts began to grow hazy from the
effects of the absinth

  etiennes step was unsteady as he
wended homeward without undress-
ing he flung himself on his bed and
soon was snoring prey to fitful dreams
and horrid nightmares which caused
him to live through scenes yet to be en-
acted and to voice wild thoughts in
tones louder than the caution of con-
sciousness would have permitted him to
use

in the room next etiennes lucien
duvallais pressed an ear against the
thin partition separating the two apart-
ments luciens face was full of hor-
ror as he listened to the ravings of des-
morts

 when i thrust monsieur clemen-
ceau dies  came etiennes voice un-
happy poniard    goad to ruin   
i dont hate    hate worse than
fiends    devils    devils   
green    blinding glare    poor
tiger i wont hurt you    die
monster    oh-h    guillotine

  followed a wild shriek of delirium
which made the listener shrink and
shudder in pallid fear

  waiting to hear no more duvallais
the poniard of charlotte corday



rushed from his apartment and down-
stairs in the hall he telephoned
french secret-service headquarters
lucien informed the department that
he had suspected etienne contemplated
crime from the moment he saw his
fellow lodger in the pension receive the
dummy figure into his apartment then
he had heard the dull thuds of a dagger
as it was wielded against the form by
etienne this followed by maudlin
talk had caused him to notify the de-
partment to act

  the voice on the other end of the
wire thanked duvallais a sharp click
greeted lucien as the secret-service
man hung up his receiver lucien went
upstairs his heart fluttering at thought
of what impended

  suppose he were wrong suppose
it were but a nightmare how would
etienne greet him thereafter he
would have lost a pleasant acquaint-
anceship how could desmorts have
become homicidal in his tendencies
lucien could not understand it but
monsieur clemenceaus life was needed
for france it must not be sacrificed
to the designs of a man suddenly
turned maniac even if etiennes
words were those of nightmare it were
best to safeguard the tiger of
france against even a dreams sug-
gestion comforted by the thought
lucien feverishly awaited the advent
of the bloodhounds of france

  they were not long in arriving-
three of them-tall powerful deter-
mined men they entered luciens
apartment and with him listened
against the wall between the two apart-
ments

  etienne still was raving to-mor-
row-he dies v his voice was more
a heavy moan charlotte    dont

   dont look at me that way   
turn    god you smile   
ah-h    fiend    clemenceau
-die when i thrust    farewell

  it was enough the three men tip-

toed from etiennes apartment and into
the hall then with three burly shoul-
ders hard pressed against etiennes
door they burst in

  as though warned by some presci-
ence in dream desmorts had awakened
and was sitting up in bed his right
hand grasped the hilt of the poniard
of charlotte corday poised ready to
strike the detectives rushed toward
him drawing revolvers etienne gave
a despairing cry then with swift
unerring aim he lifted the dagger of
charlotte corday-and plunged it deep
into his heart

  clemenceau was saved

  etiennes diary was found by the trio
after a diligent search of the whole
apartment the dummy figure in his
room was stripped of the coat desmorts
had placed upon it the crude dia-
gram of ribs and heart was revealed
on the cloth he had utilized for the
purpose beneath it foul in odor and
sliced almost to ribbons by the many
thrusts of the poniard the sleuths found
the ham it were ridiculous were it
not so tragic in its significance

  plucking the poniard from the sui-
cides heart and taking it the diarj
and the dummy form with them the
three ordinarily attired gendarmes of
the most efficient police department in
europe went down the stairs and to
their automobile against the curb out-
side

  lucien was warned to say nothing
as it was feared publicity might inspire
another attack on monsieur clemenceau
or affect him in his convalescence from
the bullet wounds inflicted in the pre-
vious attempt on his life the cen-
sorship tightened around the details
concerning the finding of the popular
monsieur etienne desmorts stabbed to
death in his apartment in the pension
des messieurs

  to the world the police gave a tale
of murder and their hunt for the slajier
of desmorts but in the private ar-
the poniard of charlotte corday

chives of the secret service of france
are set forth the details in the thwart-
ing of a crime which might have af-
fected the whole worlds policies and
in its chamber of horrors are the
hoi lowed- chest dummy and etiennes
diary

  having obtained possession of char-
lotte cordays poniard cursed with the
anathema of marats slayer the french
government pondered what to do with
the weapon it was deemed inadvisa-
ble to permit its sinister influence again
to wreck mens minds its history was
traced one member in every genera-
tion of the desmorts family it was
learned had been either a murderer a
suicide or a criminal ever since the
poniard was taken from the blood-reek-
ing hands of charlotte corday

  after many plans for its disposal
had been offered considered and re-
jected it was decided to destroy the
malign blade but how destroy it
that was the question one suggested
casting it into the seine amid appro-
priate ceremonies another would
have buried it the ocean as a grave
for it likewise was mentioned smelt-
ing it into steel with other ore seemed
to be the happiest solution thus
smelted into an ingot or pig of steel it
would remove entirely any possibility
of the poniards future use as a weapon
this disposition therefore was decided
upon

  with other odds and ends of iron
and steel the poniard of charlotte cor-
day was cast into the crucibles of the
longuevierre steel company of paris
the government breathed easier it
believed the curse was ended and that
charlottes poniard would bring harm
no more

iii

the steel revenue cutter la marne
fitted with a new boiler made by
the longuevierre steel company of
paris left her dry dock in marseilles

and steamed out into the mediterra-
nean her new boiler was the last word
in modem construction it had been
inspected and had withstood the max-
imum pressure test applied in such in-
spections

  captain raoul cartier and his engi-
neer jacques dulait were well pleased
with the excellent adjunct to their
craft which had been thoroughly over-
hauled in dry dock they could attain
a speed heretofore impossible with the
discarded boiler

  since the armistice france had
turned a vigilant eye toward her coasts
to prevent smuggling the marseilles
district as always was especially noto-
rious for the traffic in contraband

  cartier had been given strictest or-
ders to halt any suspicious craft and
if necessary to fire on any which might
flee an inspection several vessels were
stopped examined and permitted to
proceed it was a monotonous grind
of routine duty but the third day
marked a break in the monotony

  a rakish steam yacht hove in sight
every line of her built for speed cap-
tain cartier viewed this craft with deep
interest through his binoculars

  we shall see he muttered signal-
ing dulait for more speed

  under heavier pressure the la marne
darted like a thing alive through the
mediterranean swells straight toward
the yacht the stranger evidently had
no intention of submitting to an over-
hauling no sooner had the french
revenue cutter put on speed toward
her than the yacht made a swift turn
about and fairly flew through the seas

  mile after mile went pursuer and
pursued without any appreciable gain
by the la marne captain cartier by
means of a tube to the engine room
bade dulait to add more speed

  up to maximum now was the pur-
port of dulaits reply cant stand
another pound of pressure

  we must r raged the captain
the poniard of charlotte corday

else they escape more speed-more
speed

  downstairs dulait scrutinized his
gauges more speed meant more
steam more pressure on the new boiler
already strained some pounds beyond
the maximum test pressure it could
withstand it were next door to suicide

to add more but- dulait

shrugged it was duty the captain
wanted more speed he must have it
if every man aboard die for it

  working like trojans dulait and his
firemen soon had steam so high that
the engineer momentarily feared an ex-
plosion

  we gain shouted cartier through
the tube to cheer dulait but ten min-
utes more dulait ten minutes more

  nervous with dread dulait watched
the ever-climbing gauge sacre if
ever he got through this alive-never
again would he risk this pressure yet
he knew that he would risk it--because
it would be for france-france the
glorious the unconquerable the white
flame of imperishable honor

  five minutes later a gun boomed
overhead cartier had opened fire on
the fleeing yacht but he still was too
far off for his necessarily light artillery
to reach

  just a little faster he implored
dulait

  the la marne literally bounded for-
ward in response to dulaits desperate
effort to win for his captain

  two minutes more dulait fever-
ishly shouted cartier two minutes-

and our guns bite but his guns never
bit

  with a frightful roar the over-
strained boiler burst almost cracking
the cutter in two captain cartier was
cast flat on his face unconscious four
of his crew were blown skyward dead
dulait among them

 under her own momentum the la
marne staggered forward many feet
then drifted and began to settle by the
head so quickly that when she took her
last plunge she carried with her the
remaining members of her unconscious
ill-starred crew

  dulaits body was found by an ex-
pedition sent to search for the missing
la marne from his breast protruded
a thin triangular-shaped piece of steel
not unlike an ancient daggers blade
its point had found his heart

  the searchers plucked out the metal
and cast it overboard to them there
seemed no reason for keeping it or leav-
ing it imbedded in poor dulaits heart

  but when the story of the la marnes
engineer was told in france together
with the display of debris from the ill-
fated cutter certain high officials in
the scret service shuddered

  for into the steel of the la marnes
boiler had been snelted the poniard
of charlotte corday and who can
say the steel in dulaits heart was not
the same as that which ended the career
of marat in those long-ago days of the
french revolution

  the facts are told is the curse now
dead the years that lie ahead only
can tell

suspense

by xavier lecompte

carroll was uncomfortable he had the feeling that the four walls about
him made him their prisoner the stillness the delicate odor of flowers
standing dimly in a far comer the magnificent draperies that hung like
shadows on all sides the air of mystery which seemed to lurk even in the harm-
less ticking of a clock down the hallway-it all puzzled him his was a direct
nature he was unaccustomed to the subtle ways of the east but the command
had gone forth that he must see her and unafraid of anything as he usually
was he had accepted his orders quietly

    many moments passed in a sort of desolate stillness amid all the luxury
a master hand had evidently decorated the chamber each detail unpretentious
in itself melted like the tones of a symphony into the whole it was as though
the owner of the place had created a separate and individual universe all his own

    carroll had wondered from the very beginning he recalled distinctly the
bowing servant who ushered him cautiously up the wide staircase throwing
open the heavy door with one sweep of his arm he had stood for a moment
on the threshold puzzled distraught if it hadnt been that he was acting under
orders he would have turned back but he cursed himself for being too imagi-
native and entered he was on trial so to speak and it was important that he
appear courageous even if he were not

    he sat in a chair somewhat away from a large open fireplace where a fire
slumbered among the red coals casting a mysterious light over a pair of velvet
curtains that hung solemnly near him his idea was that a door lay beyond

    the rooms silence was what managed to set his nerves on edge if there
was any one behind him in the darkness they made no sound he thought
he had heard the light scraping of a shoe on the rung of a chair a little while
before but dismissed the thought from his mind

    suddenly his ears caught a faint sound beyond the curtains he grew
tense was it possible that she might come through them this held him
interested above all else his eyes swept back and forth across the folds of
velvet they lingered for a moment on what appeared to be a shining jewel
from this point they did not stir for the seeming jewel was immediately fol-
lowed by a finger and then the most sensitive hand he had ever seen it hung
in the curtains like a white rose half lost in the moonlight for a second he
wasnt sure but what it was a rose but there now appeared the slenderness
of an arm and a cool throat around which a necklace of jewels clung and glittered

    carroll couldnt move his arms had tightened on the chair and he sat
like a piece of carved stone so much depended on what he should do-what
he must say his whole future depended on the decision made in the next few
moments at least that was the way he felt then

    as he gazed upon her dead whit face he caught his first glimpse of the
gown-a shimmering dark affair that followed her supple body closely until it
seemed lost in the darkness that hung around her feet gasping carroll leaned
forward it was perfect he could tell them but he must convince them his
attention was at this moment drawn away from the lovely creature before him
by a loud voice that broke the silence like the crack of a rifle

    yawcub turn on the lights so these nize buyers from the vest can see
the vonderful gowns our house carries ah gentlemen aindt this divine
soldiers and

how uncle sam musters out
his soldiers

to the man in ranks this is the day
of days he is going home
there is an excuse for sentimen-
tality at this time and i have all the
sympathy in the world for these boys

  the war department looks upon the
private with as much favor as it does
a general where records and insurance
are concerned i might go so far as
to say that this applies in all cases
after all each one in the army is a
soldier no matter whether the man has
a plain shoulder strap or silver stars

  a careful account must be rendered
by officers in the field concerning every
man in their detachment or company
this accounting goes through the fa-
mous military channels up to the
highest authority where it is tran-
scribed and kept for future reference
it is interesting to note in this connec-
tion that the morning reports of com-
panies in the civil war are identical
with those kept in this great war and
they have been preserved with as much
care as though they were exact evi-
dence of the laws of the medes and
persians

with the start of the great war or
rather with the entry of america the
authorities at washington were con-
fronted with many major problems one
iobcb

of the greatest of these being a satis-
factory method of keeping a record of
each man in the service it might be
that the great powers in the army
worked out the present system but i
very much doubt it from an experi-
ence of two years both in the ranks
and as an officer i am inclined to say
that the men in the field have really
been the instigators and developers of
every bit of the system which has been
given the name of personnel work
when a man gets up in the morning
in the army his record for the day be-
gins and it is set down with as much
attention to detail from that hour until
he retires as though he were the only
man about whom a record was being
kept a roll is called at reveille and
still another in the evening when he
quits his days toil a roster is kept
carefully as to his various sicknesses
and the causes thereof still another
roster records his pay and there are
many more rosters for a hundred dif-
ferent purposes careful notation is
made of the history of this particular
individual from the hour which he en-
ters service until he leaves it a mere
catalogue of the forms used would run
into the thousands these forms are
divided into classes the most important
being those of the adjutant generals
office these concern enlistments dis-
charges deaths desertions and routine
 soldiers and sailors personal relief section

matters the quartermaster depart-
ment naturally keeps a careful watch
over its property and its distribution
and the number of forms there are
countless the medical ordnance
aviation and all other departments of
the army each with individual pride
and necessity has developed its own
system of forms it is truly amazing
how wide in scope and infinite in de-
tail are the regulations that govern the
preparation of all forms to the lay-
man such strict accountability seems
strange at first sight with the gradual
growth of admiration for the service
this surprise wears off and one begins
to comprehend the necessity for it ail
there have been many criticisms of the
means and methods used in the army
but so far i have yet to meet some one
who has a better system to put in its
place it may be involved it may be
hard to understand however it
works that is the acid test

  the principal bit of paper work is
the service record this is the personal
and intimate history of each individual
in the ranks it is a little booklet
wherein are recorded the name of the
man his army serial number his home
address his nearest beneficiary and
description of his person individual
scars size of shoes et cetera followed
by an account of his previous enlist-
ments and then all that happens to him
until he dies or is discharged this
booklet accompanies a soldier wherever
he goes if he is court-martialed this
is where the record appears if he wins
a medal in action if he is wounded
in battle it is written down in these
pages for example if a man deserts
the service record is forwarded to the
adjutant general of the army accom-
panied by an exact description on an-
other form and the man is posted as
a deserter over the country at this
point it is interesting to note that there
have been fewer desertions since the
war was declared than before even

though the army has been multiplied
forty or fifty times eighty-eight per
cent of the men brought up before
court-martial have been convicted no
man has been executed for a purely
military offense

  the second document which makes
a mans hair turn gray in the service is
the pay card this is a little slip of
paper upon which is written the dates
when the man is paid it is signed by
the soldier and witnessed by an officer
and the personnel adjutant who uses
it as a legal document to pay the men
it is natural that extreme care is taken
to see that this card is accurate the
personnel adjutant is responsible for
all payments of troops if he makes
an error of some magnitude and it
is shown that it was his fault he pays
the bill when i say that as personnel
adjutant i have prepared rolls for as
much as two hundred and fifty thou-
sand dollars some conception may be
obtained of the responsibility which the
government places upon an officer
had it not been for the loyal coopera-
tion of the enlisted men who prepare
these rolls i dont know where i would
be at the present moment right here
i want to say that if the public at large
knew of the loyalty of the average man
to the service and the amount of work
which he is compelled to perform it
would be amazed at one camp where
i was stationed our office never closed
the men went on in shifts and we
formed brigades almost overnight and
shipped them off to france with never-
failing regularity

  the third record of importance is the
allotment blank this is the form
which records the amount of money de-
ducted from the mans pay each month
which he gives to his family the
country knows already that uncle sam
helps the soldiers family by adding to
his allotment a concrete example will
explain this should the reader not un-
derstand for instance a man is mar-
soldiers and sailors personal relief section 

ried and has two children he is com-
pelled to make an allotment of fifteen
dollars for the wife and family the
government adds fifteen dollars for the
wife ten dollars for the first child
and seven dollars and fifty cents for
the second making a total of thirty-
two dollars and fifty cents in addition
to the mans quota it is needless to
explain that this record is about as im-
portant as any a companion paper to
this is the insurance form on this
piece of paper the amount of insurance
which a man takes out and the name
of the beneficiary are noted if the
man is twenty-eight years old and de-
sires ten thousand dollars war risk
insurance he pays six dollars and sev-
enty cents a month and this is deducted
from his pay if he should be killed
his beneficiary would be paid fifty-seven
dollars and fifty cents per month for
twenty years

  the next record is the soldiers quali-
fication card upon this little piece of
cardboard there is painstakingly re-
corded the mans principal occupation
in civilian life and all other occupations
in which he has had experience the
purpose of this card is to note what a
mans qualifications are so that as far
as possible he may be placed in similar
work in the army this card has in
addition his educational qualifications
his proficiency in foreign languages if
any his mental and physical status and
the hundred other details necessary to
the proper assignment of the man to
explain what this card stands for would
take a complete article this card is
prepared after an interview with the
man it has been the efficient instru-
ment by which we have been able to
equip and send whole divisions to
france in three months whipping a raw
bunch of civilians into soldiers almost
overnight

  now follows a long list of papers
it is unnecessary to list them here
each one is important in its place and

cannot be neglected when one re-
members that all of these papers have
got to be prepared in the front-line
trenches as well as in the comfortable
offices jn washington some idea may
be obtained of the difficulty of army
paper work the company clerk has
to grind away at his typewriter under
shell fire certain reports have to be
made no matter what conditions the
company is working under no ex-
cuses are in order a thing has to be
done and that is all there is to it did
you ever stop to think of it the list
of casualties is a result of painstaking
and long-suffering hours of men work-
ing out in the mud and rain and snow
going without their meals and suffer-
ing hardships beyond description b
is not a simple matter to do things
that is why the american army has
been the marvel of the world it has
offered an example to other nations
which holds one breathless in amaze-
ment i went into the army march
 as a private and i saw the gen-
eral development of the system from
the very start hardened as i have be-
come to its many angles i have nevef
gotten over my surprise that plain citi-
zens were able to adapt themselves to
any conditions handling highly techni-
cal problems settling them efficiently
and speedily and doing what it has
taken generations of europeans to
learn

  now we come to the day of dis-
charge

  all of these records have to be tested
and weighed and investigated the
most minute detail cannot be over-
looked if an error has been found it
must be looked into the importance
of these records is great in view of the
fact that when a man returns to civilian
life some controversy may arise and
the settlement of the case depends on
the accuracy of the papers so when
the date of mustering out arrives tjrfc
first sergeants and company clerks must
i soldiers and sailors personal relief section

buckle down to the hardest kind of
work each soldier must be paid up
to the day he leaves and clear up all
shortages in equipment or pay for the
losses he is given a uniform which
he is allowed to wear for four months
it is then returned to the government
he is instructed concerning his rights
under the insurance law his allotment
is stopped all indebtedness to the
government is cleared up he is given
a final physical examination

  the man is then handed a discharge
certificate which shows that he has
been honorably separated from the
service and is entitled to travel pay to
the place where he entered the army
the companies are lined up the organi-
zation commanders make a brief speech
to the men outlining to them what they
have gained by their life in the army
cautioning them to remember that dis-
cipline is as necessary to the private
citizen as it is to the soldier and wish-
ing them the best of luck in the world
this ceremony is made as impressive
as possible and the reader would be
surprised to know that many men re-
gret leaving the ranks even though the
life has been a hard one the day
will come when we will all look back
to those months of weary toil with a
feeling of cheerfulness that war gave us
a chance to buckle down and forget
self in the thought of our country

  when the men are gone the papers
are bundled together with rosters of the
names and are sent to the adjutant
general of the army for storage at
washington complete records are kept
and it is possible to pull out at a mo-
ments notice the history of any man

  this outline of how men are dis-
charged from the service should con-
vince the reader for good and all that
it is not a simple thing to send our boys
back home there is another thing to
remember your boy is a better citi-
zen as a result of his experience as a
soldier he has been taught to think

of others unselfishness is an art and
if he has learned it thoroughly this one
thing alone makes the war not so bad
a thing after all discipline in the
american army has not been imposed
by higher authority we have not had
to grind our men to death through long
years our discipline is self-imposed
and starts with the men the american
boy takes naturally to his duty it is
easy to teach him how to do things
his mind is nimble and he grasps in-
formation with amazing facility if he
comes back to his home with a better
conception of his duty to his family
and is satisfied as a result of these
months of privation and struggle the
relatives and friends may feel gratified
that he has been granted so fine a
chance to learn a mans job

  the returning soldier will be the con-
trolling factor in politics for the next
generation what he has learned in
the army he will impart to others in
civilian life that is why we take so
much trouble when we discharge him
to impress upon his mind the dignity
of the uniform and the privilege of a
soldier to die for things that are larger
than his own petty self america re-
sponded to the president almost as one
man she sent her sons gladly and
the thousands who died surely did not
die in vain let us be thankful that
we have been granted an opportunity
to prove our worth to the other nations
also that we have lived up to the ideal
which knows neither greed nor malice
let us be thankful that we have been
led by a president whose mind com-
prehends all things in the parlance
of the army they called us and we
came across

  caring for disabled soldiers

  an extensive program of caring for
disabled soldiers after their discharge
from military service has been an-
nounced by the war risk insurance
soldiers and sailors personal relief section 

bureau which is charged by congress
with this work twenty-one hospitals
with a capacity of fifteen hundred beds
already are in use and the war de-
partment has turned over to the treas-
ury seven camp hospitals for care of
disability cases these are to be en-
larged and improved out of the nine-
million-dollar fund appropriated for
hospitals for disabled soldiers to be con-
trolled by the war risk insurance bu-
reau and conducted by the public
health service another treasury
agency

  when treatment in the hospitals of
the war department fails to restore
men to such condition that they are fit
for active service and they are dis-
charged the work of the bureau of
war risk insurance begins

  under the provisions of the war
risk insurance act all soldiers ten per
cent disabled from causes suffered in
the line of duty are entitled to com-
pensation and to treatment by the bu-
reau of war risk insurance any man
disabled in the service and discharged
from the service may make applica-
tion for treatment to the public health
service station in his home town or
at the nearest station if immediate
treatment is necessary it will be admin-
istered by the public health service
if the need for treatment is not im-
mediate the case will be reviewed by
the bureau of war risk insurance and
assigned to a hospital

  men who after discharge develop
physical disabilities attributable to mil-
itary service are entitled to treatment
the bureau of war risk insurance
may be called upon to care for more
than twenty-five thousand cases of men
discharged for tubercular tendencies

  the war department has turned
over to the treasury department for
the care of disability cases hospitals lo-
cated at camp cody new mexico
camp hancock georgia camp joseph
e johnston florida camp beaure-

gard louisiana camp logan texas
camp fremont california and at
perry vi lie maryland about seven
hundred and fifty thousand dollars will
be expended for enlarging and improv-
ing these hospitals

  the treasury department has pur
chased the speedway hospital in chi-
cago with a capacity of fifteen thou-
sand beds improvements and changes
costing half a million dollars will be
made in the hospital and it is planned
to make this hospital a national center
of medical study and research

  portions of the battle mountain san-
itarium at hot springs south dakota
have been taken over for the work of
the war risk bureau another hos-
pital to be taken over is located at cor-
pus christi texas while one million
five hundred thousand dollars will be
expended in the erection of a hospital
at dawson springs kentucky on land
acquired as  gift to the government

  a hospital costing nine hundred thou-
sands dollars will be built at norfolk
virginia and five hundred and fifty
thousand dollars has been set aside for
the erection of a hospital in or near
the district of columbia the marine
hospital at stapleton staten island
will be taken over and one hundred and
ninety thousand dollars is to be ex-
pended in enlargement and improve-
ment

a soldiers friend

  the sixty-sixth congress did prac-
tically nothing of real consequence for
the american soldiers either to reward
them for their fine work in putting the
finishing touch to the huns or to ren-
der them assistance when the time
comes for going back to peace-time pur-
suits

  this was the statement made by rep-
resentative royal c johnson of south
dakota in answer to the question
what did the last congress do for
the soldiers 
 soldiers and sailors personal relief section

  all the talk about passing recon-
struction or readjustment legislation to
benefit the soldiers ended in just talk
said johnson

  representative johnson was a sol-
dier in the war serving in all the
grades from private to captain served
in the house of representatives before
the war was declared and was dis-
charged from the army and went back
to congress after the armistice was
signed he appears to be in a better
position than any other member of con-
gress to answer the question

  all that congress did to benefit the
soldiers was to give them two months
extra pay upon their discharge and al-
low them to keep their uniforms con-
tinued representative johnson

  congress did nothing in the way of
the much discussed reconstruction of
legislation and what reconstruction
there has been was carried on by the
federal departments the work of
sending to college after their discharge
young men who were taken away from
school and put into the army during
the war was carried on by the depart-
ments a large number of young men
were sent back to college by the gov-
ernmment which paid their expenses

  but congress failed to do anything
to offer employment for the returning
soldiers who had been taken away from
steady jobs and who in the majority of
cases could not return to them

  it also failed to adopt a system like
that of canada for giving the soldiers
extra pay upon discharge based on the
length and character of their service

  on the contrary many thousands
of the soldiers were brought back and
dumped in new york city instead of
provision being made for sending them
back to their homes their families and
their jobs many of them are still
there the subjects of charity and can
neither obtain suitable employment
there nor get back to where they came
from

  another woeful omission of con-
gress was the failure to reform the
articles of war and the court-martial
regulations so that an american can
serve in the army with a feeling that
he will get the measure of justice to
which he would be entitled in civil
life

  representative johnson is confident
that reforms will be effected in the
court-martial proceedings and sweeping
changes made in the articles of war
by the next congress he has already
obtained enough pledges from the mem-
bers of the next congress to insure
these reforms he said

soldiers saved from death by
president

  three more death sentences imposed
by general court-martial have been com-
muted by president wilson two of
the men had been given the death pen-
alty for willful disobedience of orders
but the third aaron h smith was sen-
tenced to death at camp greenleaf
georgia for having uttered unusually
seditious statements

  according to the papers forwarded
here smith said he would rather
be in a german military prison under
the military heel of germany than in
the united states army on another
occasion in the presence of many offi-
cers and enlisted men he said that
german atrocity was better than
american autocracy

  major general henry g sharpe
commander of the department of the
southeast recommended that the sen-
tence be commuted to dishonorable dis-
charge and imprisonment for twenty-
five years but president wilson com-
muted it to dishonorable discharge and
fifteen years at fort leavenworth

  the other death sentences commuted
were those of arshag ashbahain com-
pany m fourth infantry to dishonor-
able discharge and ten years and frank

tion

  president wilson disapproved the

questions and answers

 private j r-question i was
discharged from the army in january
after ten months service overseas and
six months spent in training camps
here before entering the service i
had been a sales clerk in a large pro-
vision house where i had acquired a
thorough knowledge of dairy products
but on my return here i was unable
to secure my old position and tried un-
successfully to get another then
friends of mine who own a dairy farm
in nebraska wrote offering me work
for them but my home and my people
are here and i should not like to leave
them for the west what should i do
the opportunity offered by my friends
is the only one open to me should i
take it

 answer you should know best
about this but it seems to me a wise
thing for you to accept the position
offered you in view of the fact that it
seems difficult to secure one in your
own home town

  corporal l m f-question be-
fore i went overseas in may  i

had been on friendly terms with a girl
of whom i was very fond i had hoped
that when i came back i would ask
her to marry me but she now seems
to take no interest whatever in me and
it is just as if we had never been more
than acquaintances she does not even
ask me to call on her and though i
am still very fond of her i am not the
sort to push myself where i do not
know my standing please advise me
what i should do

  answer this is a delicate situation
i think that you should either have a
heart-to-heart talk with the girl in ques-
tion or else drop her altogether from
your mind if she does not care for
you surely you do not want to many
her however faint hearts never win
fair ladies i would make an attempt
to learn the truth from her at least

  sergeant s g-question i was
drafted in january  at the age of
twenty-two went to france soon after
and returned to this country in the
spring of  buring my absence-
abroad my mother who was a widow
and with whom i had always lived had
remarried my stepfather though an
american was strongly pro-german
and a man whom i never liked or got
on with now i get along even worse
with him and feel that i cannot con-
tinue to make my home as i used to
with my mother because he is there i
love my mother deeply and should hate
to leave her but feel that for my hap-
piness i must do you think i should
wait a little longer and hope that things
at home will improve

  answer it is unfortunate this sit-
uation and i can only advise you to
talk at length with your mother per-
haps she will understand your position
if you state it fairly and simply she
is entitled to her happiness but it is
to be regretted that she married a man
out of sympathy with his own country

lately seen a man i know well who was
drafted the same time i was sent to the
same camp trained in the same outfit
and discharged at the same time this
man was a bugler and so far as i know
never shot an army rifle in his life
but here at home and still in uniform
i have seen him wearing a sharpshoot-
ers medal in our camp buglers were
not required to drill go to the rifle
range or stand any of the usual for-
mations i should like to know where
this faker got his medal

  answer i would say offhand that
your friend is merely adopting an honor
to which he is not entitled give him
fair warning of the dangerous consc-
iences of such an act it is illegal
to wear any military insignia not fairly
earned through official channels

  h p g-question since being
discharged from the army several
months ago i have been receiving each
month war risk insurance blanks and
letters from the government i had not
seen overseas or suffered any injury in
service and thought that in my case the
insurance automatically stopped on the
date of discharge why does the gov-
ernment keep writing to me i dont
want to keep up the insurance and never
wrote the government that i did so

  answer you are very unwise to
give up your insurance you are al-
lowed six months grace and if you can-

not assume the same amount you car-
ried while in the army you can at least
take up a small portion of it write
at once to the bureau in washington
and make arrangements to continue
your insurance

  interested-question what reg-
ulations have been drafted covering the
equipment that a soldier may keep after
discharge 

  answer every enlisted man on
discharge the war department an-
nounced will be allowed to retain as
his personal property the following arti-
cles of uniform equipment overseas
cap for men with overseas service
hat for others olive drab shirt woolen
coat and ornaments woolen breeches
one pair shoes one pair leggins one
waist belt one slicker and overcoat two
suits underwear four pairs stockings
one pair gloves one toilet set one bar-
racks bag gas mask and helmet-for
overseas men only soldiers who have
turned in their equipments are author-
ized to redraw them by applying to the
director of storage in this city

  the department calls attention to the
fact it is unlawful for a discharged sol-
dier to wear the regulation uniform
without the red chevrons which show
his connection with the military estab-
lishment has been terminated according
to law
the following letter appeared not
long ago in one of the new york
dailies we think it should
prove of interest to thrill book read-
ers

to the editor

  sir  is there such a thing as communica-
tion with the dead conan doyle and sir
oliver lodge intellectual and keenly poised
men whose writings thousands have read
with admiration both assert that they have
received communications from their sons
killed in the war many wonders that were
fantastic dreams a few years back are
now realities man flies thousands of miles
he throws his voice across oceans and con-
tinents he sends messages around the world
without wires i have always been skeptical
of happenings or manifestations beyond the
ken of demonstrable science but the mod-
em marvels give me pause may it not be
that a link exists between the finite and in-
finite that is only a branch of science still in
its infancy	s v

  we are inclined to agree with the
writer of the above letter we have
entirely recovered from our one-time

habit of scoffing at what we didnt un-
derstand if men like conan doyle
and sir oliver lodge believe in the
unseen we at least feel at liberty to
keep open hearts concerning the mat-
ter we have thought a great deal
about it we have published a number
of mystic and occult stories we have
been wondering what our readers
thought about the matter why not
start some thought along these lines
if you are interested in any occult or
mysterious philosophy why not write to
us we will print the best letters we
receive and open up some of the pages
in the thrill book to this discus-
sion candidly it will be as much for
our own information as for yours

  the psychic field is enormous and
amazing in its wide spread and in its
ramifications to doubt that much of
psychic claim has full proof may be
imbecile mind-reading mental telep-
athy and a hundred significant phe-


cross-trails

nomena are established to our minds
beyond dispute as are the everyday
parts of material industries what is
needed more than anything else is an
intelligent discussion of the many sides
of the questions

  are the dead with us there is a
good question to ask there are people
who scoff and those who claim they are
not interested but many of these are
either poseurs or tellers of untruths
it is the one subject which every one
discusses sooner or later

  let our readers discuss this matter
publicly in the thrill book we
will be glad to publish the best letters
from both sides provided they do not
exceed three hundred words

ljow little we really know about the
 unseen world of science only
trow and then word comes to the lay-
man of some marvelous discovery that
sets the world afire it was so with
radium wireless telephones the tank
we knew nothing about them until they
were in use this is only natural sci-
ence is a study that requires a life-
time to master and even then the stu-
dent realizes that he has only gathered
a few of the fundamentals together
we personally are rather interested
in the development of the dramatic
angles of science and when the rapid-
fire novelette a thousand degrees
below zero by murray leinster came
into our hands we jumped at the chance
to put it in the thrill book here
is a writer who not only understands
science from the viewpoint of a scholar
but who also is a bom fictioneer
without doubt a thousand degrees
below zero contains a very strange
situation we leave it to you sup-
pose on a broiling hot day in august
you saw a cake of ice floating down the
hudson river and from the center
there rose a column of steam sounds
wild doesnt it read a thousand
degrees below zero and find out how

simple it all is if you know the laws
of science

rtrhe second installment of the
opium ship by h bedford-
jones carries sir gerald desmond iruo
a still more conflicting series of ad-
ventures it is a pleasure to read a
serial so entertainingly written so brim-
ful of action and mystery

tod robbins contributes another
startling bit of fiction called a
voice from beyond there is noth-
ing that comes from his pen that does
not grip one from the first line to the
last in addition he knows the art of
short-story writing about as well as
any of the younger school we are
going to give his new novel red of
surley a little publicity here even
though it doesnt appear in the thrill
book- it was published this spring by
harper  brothers and it sets a new
standard for fiction we are glad to
say that we have only recently pur-
chased one of mr robbins new novels
and we are going to give it to you in
the very near future it is weird un-
usual fantastic we can guarantee
from close observation that nothing
like it has appeared in any of the other
magazines

among the stories in this issue that
 we can recommend especially are
the lost empire by frank wall
the mate by may freud dickenson
and the poniard of charlotte cor-
day by francois de vallient there
are two bizarre occult tales back to
earth byr ray baker and room
 by will s gidley

what do you think of the first
story in the tates of the double
man series  the author clyde
broadwell has made a close study of
the psychic and unseen it was a vic-
tory for us to get him to put into fio

a man to keep your eye on

it is gratifying to note here the un-
usual amount of praise we are re-
ceiving about our soldiers and sailors
personal relief section letters come
in regularly from all parts of the world
the requests for information do not all
get into print because many of them
are confidential we are including
every letter that we are able to pub-
lish because in this way the informa-

old army sergeant spotted lieutenant

  george w keller an experienced army
sergeant was walking up park row new
york city one afternoon recently in
front of the park row building he saw a
young man wearing the shoulder bars
hat cord and puttees of a united stajes
army lieutenant the coat however was
of a material such as is generally worn
by privates

  keller did not salute instead he walked
past and then turned around to make a
closer observation of the lieutenant

  what in the hell are you looking at
the latter demanded

i am looking at you was the reply

  what are you looking at me for ex-
claimed the lieutenant

  im looking at you as part of the in-
born right of an american citizen i
think you are phony

  an agent of the department of justice
happened along and both men accom-
panied him to the departments office in
the park row building the lieutenant
said he was charles thomas eighteen
years old of no  chauncey street
brooklyn of the american red cross

he was taken to the offices of assistant

united states attorney burdeau where
he produced a card certifying that
charles thomas was a second lieutenant
in the red cross motor corps it was
signed doctor smiley per r b and
on the back was countersigned charles
thomas

  inquiry at the offices of the local red
cross failed to elicit any information
concerning the young man

fire veteran at ninety-four leads
parade

  new york citys oldest fireman john
f wenman felt the rheumatism stirring
in his legs at the end of the day for in
the afternoon he had marched two miles
in the bleak damp wind at the head of
the annual washingtons birthday parade
of the exempt and volunteer firemen
association of new york city mr wen-
man who shouted through the trumpet
of an assistant chief in  is ninety-
four years old sixty-five other former
fire fighters none of them younger than
seventy-eight marched behind him

  mr wenmans white beard floated high
in the air and his legs did not falter as
he led the veteran firemen past the re-
viewing stand in union square each
man wore the heavy helmet he had used
in the days when he climbed ladders and
handled hose and dangling at his hip was
a cap which he might put on when the
helmet grew tiresome half of the men
wore the buff uniform of the exempt fire-
mans association showing that they had
served at least five yars in the depart-
ment the others wore the blue of the
volunteer firemens association

  carefully polished for the occasion the
old hand-power engine  which threw
water into the top stories of the sky-
scrapers of  brought up the rear of
around the world

the parade with thirty veterans tugging

mi the ropes that pulled it

 many old firemen felt too weak to
ffiarch thomas f kerrigan seventy-five
years old solved the problem of showing
his enthusiasm by mounting the review-
ing stand and waving a small american
ag as his comrades passed cheering

 with him on the stand were john r
voorhis former commissioner of elec-
tions patrick h whitney former com-
missioner of correction and alderman
john j mccourt dietrich g gale
eighty-five years old was in charge of
the reviewing stand

 led by beiders band and a squad of
mounted policemen the veteran firemen
set out from their headquarters in jef-
ferson market they marched through
tenth street to fifth avenue and then
north to union square when they
reached the equestrian statue of george
washington on the south side of the
quare they halted and while the band
played the star-spangled banner john
mulligan seventy-nine years old scram-
bled up an old fire ladder and placed a
wreath at the feet of the father of his
country

  then the veterans proceeded past the
reviewing stand where they waited while
the band played a concert piece the
line of march continued west through
seventeenth street to kighth avenue
north to thirty-fourth street and east to
sixth avenue where the parade was dis-
banded

  called a pro-hun soes to get even

  a lawsuit of extraordinary interest will
be tried at the april term of the logan
county court at russell springs kansas
it is the first attempt at a backfire of
those who were suspected of being pro-
german during the war and who were
dealt with publicly by their neighbors for
failing to do their duty in war activities

  f j hanson of mcalester has brought
suit for one hundred and twenty thou-
sand dollars against f e brooke and
other neighbors for damages which he
claims he suffered at their hands

 hanson has lived in logan county
since the eighties he is a wealthy land
owner during the war be had a stormy

time of life it is said he refused to buy

liberty bonds or to contribute to the
red cross his neighbors asserted that
he was strongly pro-german

  the loyal americans of the community
were aroused by hansons attitude it is
said and finally the hansons were ar-
rested for violating the regulations of the
food administration

 the hansons suspected that the mc-
millans their neighbors had furnished
the evidence upon which they were ar-
rested and hanson purchased nine hun-
dred and sixty acres which mcmillan had
been leasing for many years as pasture
land

  franklin e brooks of winona was one
of the leaders of the community in war
activities he is captain of company e
kansas home guards fourteenth bat-
talion he also is interested in a bank
it was these connections which made him
a leader of the patriotic sentiment of the
county with the fourth liberty loan
coming on last fall and being anxious
that the county should go over the top
brooke went to kansas city kan to
consult fred robertson united states
district attorney it is said concerning
the case of the hansons

  brooke claims that he was advised by
one of robertsons assistants to tell han-
son that he must make a subscription
and buy some bonds brooke came back
to winona and after a consultation with
hanson it was agreed that hanson was
to sell the nine hundred and sixty acres
of grazing land to mcmillan for three
thousand seven hundred dollars enough
to cover the price which hanson had paid
for the land and his expenses so that
hanson would have money enough to in-
vest in liberty bonds and give to the
red cross

 after the deal was made hanson in-
vested two thousand- five hundred dollars
in bonds gave two hundred dollars to the
red cross and deposited the other one
thousand for investment in future war
activities

 then the war came to an end and the
armistice was signed then also came a
lawsuit filed by hanson against mcmillan
to set aside the deed for the land and
around the world



one hundred and twenty thousand dollars
lawsuit against brooke for damages

 brooke has a son in the army a lieu-

 phone he alive after grave is dug

 funeral arrangements were completed
death notices were published and a grave
was being dug for the remains of william
i mclaughlin twenty-two years old
when there arrived at the family home
in boston mass the body of a seventy-
year-old man of the same name but no
relation

 this led to the discovery that the boy
reported dead was in perfect health and
that there had been a gruesome mistake
by an unknown naval official in washing-
ton

 a telegram announcing the death
reached the young mans home on a re-
cent night the message nearly pros-
trated the mother still mourning her
husband who died recently arrange-
ments were made at once for the funeral
floral pieces were ordered and the site
of the grave picked

 word of the death spread rapidly
scores of friends of the family began call-
ing at the house then came another
telegraph message that the body left
washington at two oclock in the after-
noon and would arrive in boston next
day

 as soon as this was received thomas
j mclaughlin a brother studying for
the priesthood in new york conferred
with priests of the church of the blessed
sacrament relative to the time of the
funeral mass notices were sent then to
members of jamaica plain council
knights of columbus for a special meet-
ing to take action on the death and plan
for attending the services

 the brothers of the boy undertaker
roach and several relatives went to the
south station to meet the body when
the train pulled in a short casket was put
off the brothers thought there must be
a mistake as william is slightly under
six feet to make certain the casket was
taken to the undertaking rooms opened
and there was found a man of over
seventy

 fearing that his brother was dead and

that a wrong body had been shipped
thomas telephoned to washington but
was told the corpse of william mclaugh-
lin had been sent and none other a sec-
ond call was made to washington and
this time thomas talked with william at
st elizabeths hospital

  will is this you anxiously asked
thomas sure why all the excitement
replied the brother he was told the
story run all the way home and tell
mother and the girls i am in perfect
health and expect my discharge in a few
days ordered william

  telegrams were sent to the navy de-
partment immediately explaining the er-
ror hours later some time after mid-
night a reply was received

 some time ago william mclaughlin
went to st elizabeths hospital suffering
with influenza he recovered rapidly but
was directed to remain there for his dis-
charge from the service meanwhile sev-
enty-year-old william mclaughlin died
his body is again en route to washington
on direction from the authorities there

hog alive after six months in straw

pile

  farmers are discussing with consider-
able interest and merry humor a strange
incident that occurred on the farm of
henry merrill about three miles north of
cutler 

  last fall when mr merrill thrashed his
wheat one of his fattening hogs got out
of the pen and disappeared search was
made for it but no trace of the animal
was found it was quite a mystery but
merrill was too busy to devote much time
to solving it he was making a straw
shed for some of his stock to winter in
however when the roof fell in before
it was finished he abandoned the idea

  in clearing away the straw recently
imagine his amazement when he beheld
a long thin skeletonlike hog drag itself
from beneath the pile a closer inspec-
tion revealed the undeniable fact that the
hungry porker was the one he had lost
last fall the hog was little more than
skin and bones but is already filling out
on the selected food that is being given
it in generous portions mr merrill is
io

around the world

confident that the hog will regain its lost
weight rapidly and he expects it will be
ripe for slaughtering long before next
fall

  farmers in the vicinity are wondering
that the hog survived the winter or that
it did not succeed in rooting itself free
from the big straw pile some are of the
opinion that it slept most of the time
hibernating as it were like bears and
other wild animals do anyway the hog
had a warm nest and was never in danger
of freezing to death

  wins medal for new variety of com

  doctor frederick s de lue a boston
oculist has received a medal from the
horticultural society of massachusetts
for having developed the highest grade
of sweet corn a variety he has named
golden giant the award is extraordi-
nary in that the conservative massachu-
setts society has mae no award for
corn in the last sixty-seven years this
was because of the minor defects its ex-
perts found in all specimens presented
doctor de lues variety is deemed near-
est the ideal both in physical form and
in nutritive values

  many years ago doctor de lue became
deeply interested in plant life because of
its relationship with the life of the ordi-
nary human being

  corn admittedly excels in nutrition and
doctor de lue concentrated his efforts
on the native american grain so for
more than seventeen years he worked
toward the ideal corn his efforts were
successful when the golden giant was
perfected-

  the new variety is remarkable in that
it matures from two to four weeks earlier
than any other sweet corn is grown wifrh
vastly less labor and has from sixteen to
twenty-two rows of fine healthy and
large kernels

  year after year it is grown without a
single white speck or imperfection- per-
fection of crop after crop for the last
three years is attested by thousands of
letters and communications sent to doc-
tor de lne from all over the world even
from distant china

  the golden giant is rich in protein

starches and sugar and the experts of
the massachusetts society praise its
nourishing qualities and general charac-
teristics tests have been made showing
it to be much richer in the nutriment for
the human system than any known corn
at several of the government experi-
mental stations and state farms it is be-
ing tried this year

  from his experimental farm at need-
ham mass doctor de lue is sending
packages of sample seed to all parts of
the world

  poodle adopts seven jack rabbits

  rachael a woolly poodle dog belonging
to mrs mary colbert near fort worth
texas is mothering seven little jack rab-
bits and doing the job in a manner which
evidently pleases the long-eared tribe
the poodle had recently lost her five lit-
tle children she was almost wild with
grief then all at once she became her
old self again and was frisking about the
place ia a way which excited the curiosity
of her owner

  mrs colbert noticed that her pet made
frequent trips to a wooded spot several
hundred yards from the house she fol-
lowed her and there discovered her fondly
caressing the little jack rabbits

  rachael had found the mother rabbit
near her home r at home and killed
her then she took charge of the or-
phans and is bringing them up

  mrs colbert says she will allow the
poodle to bring the little rabbits home
when she cares to and that she will let
them taice their place in the yard
