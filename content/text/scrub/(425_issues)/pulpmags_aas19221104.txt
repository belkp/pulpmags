and hes worth every cent of it came
here several years ago asking for a job
he got just that-a small job at a small salary

  then i forgot about him-hardly knew he
was on the payroll until one day i got a letter
from the international correspondence schools
telling me that thomas a andrews had en-
rolled for a course and had received a mark
of  for his first lesson

   theres a man worth watching i said to
myself so i began to keep tabs on his work
pretty soon he began coming to me with
suggestions i could almost see him growing

  somehow he was the first man i thought
of whenever there was a position open and
he always made good because he was always
preparing himself for the job ahead we pay
him  a week now and hes going to be
earning even a larger salary some day i
wish we had more men like him

this special training right at home in spare time
one hour a day spent with the i c s in the
quiet of your own home will bring you more

cess means

-still  gun

    the sturdy stevens shotgun made
    its first kills in the hands of our
    grandfathers with it our fathers
    first experienced the joys of hunting

       and today young men treasure it
    not only for its past but because
    right today the good old stevens
    still maintains its unbroken record
    for hard and straight shooting

      you can buy a more expensive
    gun than a stevens but you can-
    not buy better shooting qualities
    shotgun or rifle-a stevens firearm
    is accurate

      when a stevens barrel is bored
    or drilled the final reaming cuts
    away less than one-half of a
    thousandth of an inch

         for rifling stevens uses a special proc-
     ess slow scraping system removing ess
     than the thirtieth part of a thou-
     sandth of an inch with each pass of the
     rifling cutter a slow method-but when
     finished a stevens barrel is accurate

        and a stevens will continue to shoot
     straight stevens guns are fitted so they
     cant shoot loose

        when you buy a stevens you are buy-
     ing unexcelled shooting qualities and you
     are paying a reasonable price

         stevens manufactures a complete
       line of small bore rifles and shotguns

chapter i

 the cracker pot

according to the ethics of literary
construction the first chapter pro-

	 vides a convenient vestibule wherein
the characters assemble for their formal
bow to the reader-hence the scrolling of
said  first chapter within the sordid con-
fines of chink-nail connorss cracker pot
cafe and that irrespective of the fact that
the fate of a kingdom was involved

first of all we must turn the dial of time
back some thirty odd years for the cracker
pot has gone the way of manv another
cherry hill resort that drew patronage from
 a

  water street society institutions that have
  folded their tents and stolen away because
  they no longer dared lay down the gage
  of battle with the mcauley mission

    the name  cracker pot  rested on no
 ephemeral nom de phime but was founded
 upon the substantial though questionable
 hospitality of a barrel of crackers that al-
 ways stood in the center of connorss bar-
 room floor of course this was a bif cheap
 compared with a certain more affluent estab-
 lishment nearer the bowery where a thou-
 sand silver dollars were screwed to the bar-
 room floor but it was far more acceptable
 to the cracker pot patrons

was connorss oft-repeated command to one
of his aid de camps  you got to make
em thoisty as a camphor ball before theyll
irrigate

  standing in the small barroom with its
low ceiling yellow with the fumes of violent
nicotine one could hear the throbbing life
of the brooklyn bridge high overhead
where the cable wheels of that day sang an
incessant metallic drone

  the deep-throated whistles of the sound
steamers might just as well have popped
their signals in connorss back room so
close was the cracker pot to the east river
and the gossiping bells of the old-time horse
cars were always jangling not more than a
block away a section of new york where
the odor of tar and tobacco hung over each
alley street and slip

  connors had acquired the sobriquet of
chink-nail by assiduously nursing the
growth of the nail which decorated the little
finger of his right hand it was a full
half inch beyond the hygenic danger zone
which prevails in polite society but quite
orthodox according to chinese standards-
hence chink-nail

  had you asked any of the frequenters of
the cracker pot  do you know where
connors came from they would have an-
swered  sure-the bowery but the
gentleman himself in what you might term
his loquacious moods would hint of a pre-
bowery career one which had culminated
in pugilistic honors all of which the most
skeptical might have believed after witness-
ing connorss modus operandi when ejecting
an undesirable

    the gent is going to say  good night 
connors would announce and if by reason
of stupidity the  gent  failed to accelerate
his departure connorg would invite his
cracker pot audience to witness the ease
with which he would speed the parting
guest  im going to put him out with four
fingers he would observe meaning that he
would use his right hand without disturbing
the polished beauty of the chink nail

  just behind the barroom there was a
ladies parlor to which any stickling
patroness might have access through a hall-
way the street door of which was uncom-
promisingly labeled  ladies parlor

   in turn behind the ladies parlor there
was a roomy hall the like of which--pro-
viding the modem cabaret acknowledges
any embryonic prototype - must have
served as the parent stem and as our story
opens the raucous piano within this hall is
vibrating under the hammer touch of mr
eddie carbon a most versatile ivory spe-
cialist whose color harmonized with the
name he bore

  out in the barroom emile who flatly
insisted upon being called  the manager
had assumed the professional  at rest 
pose which only a certain type of new york
bartender can negotiate a bit of elegant
slouchiness and the haughty countenance
that goes with it he was waiting for the
return of connors who usually dined in
chinatown on saturday night

   facing emile across the bar was one of
the habitues of the place a human atom
who still bore some trace of his former dig-
nity and intelligence but who was fast slid-
ing into the catalogue of derelicts even now
he was known to the cracker pot patrons as
 joie the jug

    its this way joie said emile  we
are dealing with crooks and  dont know
which way to play the game connors has
got the goods but captain jake knows their
value-so there you are

   joie was about to reply but emile inter-
rupted him

   easy there-easy-here comes connors
now

   with toothpick perked at a jaunty angle
from the corner of his mouth connors
paused at the corner of the cracker pot
bar

    everything going all right emile he
asked

   cernly replied the white-aproned
manager

   anv word from captain jake

    no

    thats bad

   the smug satisfaction of animal comfort
occasioned by a full meal gave way to a
scowl that crimped the lines radiating from
connorss eyes while his beauty nail beat
a speculative tattoo against the erstwhile
polished bar

    no telegram or nothin he asked
crafty rogues



   no-just nothing

   its all wrong emile-i got to do some-
thin here i am trying to run a nice re-
spectable business and along comes jake
and loads me up with trouble

  emile made no reply

   its all wrong connors continued
emile shot a long bony finger to within
an inch of connorss nose it was as square
as a piece of hemlock joist

   it serves you right for mushing around
with one of your relatives he announced

   hold on there emile he aint no hon-
est-to-goodness relation of mine jake slid
into the family album on a wedding hes
just the smell that sticks around wit th
onion-thats all

   all right-sooner or later jake will eat
the onion

  here emile paused and glared at con-
nors as if such profound logic could not
possibly fail to make an impression then
he leaned forward

   know what he finally asked

   im listening was connorss laconic
reply

   four sailors who said they came to new
york on captain jakes schooner were in
here to-night looking for you

  the news was evidently disquieting to
connors the truth was he regretted the
opportunity which had been given to emile
to talk to with these men

   what did they want he finally asked
 said they intended to get their share
of big money as promised by j ake or hold
you responsible

   me exclaimed connors

   yes-you they say that -here his
voice sank to a low vibrating treble- a
certain foreign govmt would give a million
dollars to know what jake brought into this
port

   emile said connors with a splendid
show of disinterestedness  you ought to
get a job telling fairy stories in some kinder -
garden

   it would be soft compared with handing
facts to some people i know of for in-
stance here is a nice fat little fact for you
those sailors know that jake hid his ques-
tionable cargo right here in the cracker
pot and they say that you are his partner

in the meanest conspiracy that ever got into

history

  connorss flabby cheeks lost their pinkish
glow the versatile barman had hit hard
it was bad enough to discover that captain

jakes buccaneer crew knew something of
the possible value of the daring venture but
far more disquieting to learn that emile also
knew he did not trust emile and now
came the question-how much information
did he really possess and to what extent was
he twisting it for his own personal ends
he also wondered what emile knew con-
cerning captain jakes recent movements

  however he was not to be tortured for
any great length of time on the rack of
suspense

   when this smelly relative of yours left
new york last monday where do you sup-
pose he went asked emile with a most ex-
asperating sneer

  the question was a revelation to connors
who supposed that he alone possessed
knowledge bearing on captain jakes secret
mission and the day of his departure it
also filled him with apprehension to ig-
nore emile completely would be folly and
yet it annoyed connors to find that he was
being roughly shouldered by his own bar-
tender if emile had gained a full or par-
tial knowledge of the monetary rewards
that were to follow the successful issue of
jakes venture he would certainly demand
a share of the spoils-hence connorss de-
cision to assume a confidential chatty man-
ner for the purpose of drawing the man on

   i dont hafta do no supposin at all
emile-i know was connorss reply
 jake went to washington

  yehl was emiles sneering comment
with a rising inflection that was saturated
with contempt

   sure he went there on big business
excuse me emile if i dont draw you no
diagram of captain jakes little trip but
ill say this hes liable to see th secretary
of state down there i dont know-maybe
jakes going to stay at his house all night
talking things over or somethin like that
i tell you emile its big

   down in washington emile deri-
sively wagged his head

   of course i oughta know when i went


argosy-allstory weekly

to the station with him and just as the
train was starting says to him  so-long
jake take good care of yourself 

   he couldnt have got off that train this
side of rahway or nothin like that-could
he

  consternation was fast crowding surprise
from connorss face there was no mis-
taking the assurance with which emile had
asked his question

   what do you mean-this side of rah-
way connors blustered

   i mean that captain jake never went
to washington but came right back to
newr york after he kissed you good-by
i mean that he cleared for boston last
tuesday his old tub hit the sound just
about the time you thought hed be asking
the secretary of state for a little more
demi-tasse

  connors clutched the bar to steady him-
self his implicit faith in captain jake
was shaken he began to understand why
a full week had slipped by without receiv-
ing any word from him

   im good for ap-a-plexy he moaned
 and me thinking that this international
bunk was easy money listen emile there
aint no foreign government tremblin wit
nervous prostration on account of what
jake brought to new york and wished on
me no easy money-no nothing do you
know what that sw-ab-eared jakes last
words to me was

   what

    chink-nail said he  before the end of
the week you and i will be up at the hoff-
man house eating with a certain foreign
ambassador well be exchanging the re-
sults of my perlous voyage for real money
thats what he says to me and of course
emile i was going to look after your in-
terests i was there i was saying to my-
self  emiles got to be in on this-and-

   sure interrupted emile who was sat-
isfied with the progress he wras making

   and here ive been flossied by the man
i learned to call  uncle  at my mothers
knee finished connors with a sigh that
reflected confusion and uncertainty

  emile had been scrutinizing the few
cracker pot patrons that were scattered
about the room evidently he was satis-

fied as he beckoned for connors to accom-
pany him to the back room

  the crestfallen autocrat obeyed without
protest

   sit down said emile pulling a chair
up to one of the tables then he leaned
across the board and motioned for connors
to draw near

   jake told the truth he whispered
 youve got a fortune right in your hands
-something that can be turned into gold-
do you get it gold i say 

   nice words emile and i gives you
credit you mean all right

   im all right and i can prove it but
first i want to ask you a question where
do i come in on this seems to me that my
interests what you was talking about ought
to be understood

  emile if i could trust my bartender as
easy as he can trust his boss we wouldnt
need no lawyer im square-i got to be-
you have been giving me quotations right
off my own stock ticker you gets half

   all right-now listen those sailors
came into this port on captain jakes
schooner-didnt they

   i suppose so

   very well they say that everything
is straight i talked with them for a half
hour

  connors winced

 this is our chance to check him up
where did jake say he began this voyage
 said that he beat it up from the gulf
of guinea answered connors chewing on
the unlighted stub between his teeth

   that agrees with my information-
what next

  connors paused before answering it
flashed through his mind that in reality he
was giving emile more information than he
was receiving

   made his first stop at the azores he
finally replied

   correct now get this-they were at
fayal where jakes got more friends than
he has in new york and one of his pals
there tipped him off that the portuguese
govmt was burnin up the cables with mes-
sages to look out for a certain schooner that
was making for the states and to delay its
sailing-by all means
crafty rogues



   you will have to excuse me emile if

i dont stamp my feet and whistle like as
if i was up in the gallery at harry miners

-but honest emilie these sailors dont
make no hit with me

   why not

   because  know jake he aint leaving
no valuable propty behind him

  emile was far too clever to belittle the
wisdom of connorss reply he knew there
was some truth in it captain jake was
as avaricious as he was cunning a bold
and crafty manipulator who seldom left
anything to chance connors might be
right jake would hardly absent himself
from the place of concealment if his mys-
terious cargo was worth all he claimed
then again-had he really gone to boston

  emile was not sure the information
came straight enough but even so it might
be part of jakes plan to confuse the situa-
tion for the purpose of furthering his dark
schemes

 well-ill admit that he wouldnt be
apt to said emile rather reluctantly but
you never can tell anyway i know how
vou can bring the entire thing to a head
 how

    by taking a little trip to boston thats
the only way you will find him

  the thought of surrendering such valued
revenues as the cracker pot receipts to the
option of his bartender cast no roseate hues
in connorss mind although he saw that the
suggestion had a grain of wisdom in it

   what would i do after igot there he
asked

   comb the wharves until you got a line
on his schooner

   i might take eddie carbon with me
mused connors  that co n would smell
out jakes creaking old hulk if he got within
a mile of it eddies the only good luck
jake ever brought me honest emile did
you ever hear anybody love a pianner the
way he does

   you cant take eddie

   why not

    because jake left him here to look after
the stuff hes the only man that dares to
go in that cellar i wouldnt put my head
in that pit for a block of houses eddie
ftaysr here

then its all off i dont go to no
boston-the cracker pot for mine saying

which connors strode out of the room

  as he did so joie the jug slouched in
and seated himself a the table with emile

   hows things breakin he asked

   cant say yet you see im shiftin
round first on one leg then on the other
gettin my information from too many dead
ones but ill have my bearings in the next
twenty-four hours-then ill know how to
act get out of here i dont want con-
nors to see me talking to you beat it

  connors was uneasy in a few minutes
he returned and once more seated himself
at the table opposite emile

   of course you can suit yourself about
this boston trip said emile  but i can
tell you this if you dont find jake and
bring him back to new york there isnt
going to be any cracker pot those sailors
say that you are standing in with jake on
some deal that cuts them out and they are
going to give you just three days to pro-
duce him three days then they shoots up
the cracker pot have you got it

   thats just my luck connors moaned

 here ive been slavin to make this a nice
respectable little business and along comes
this swivel-eyed jake and busts up my lifes
savings hows a man goin to make an
honest livin any more you know all the
trouble ive had-what with this new re-
form-and sunday closin and all that i
tell you emile its up wit the shutters for
me just as soon as the first gun pops why
only last week the captain of this district
says to me  youre doin all right connors
but the broad highway for yours as soon as
any rough stuff commences its a shame-
me standin all o k wit th police-
and-

  shut up whispered emile here
comes a plaindothesman now

mosphere of the cracker pot seemed
charged with nervous tension the big fel-
lows face was far too familiar to some of
them the  live ones  in front of the bar
took refuge in grim silence in the dance
hall eddie carbon tame to a dead center
among the high notes of a wonderful musi-
cal wallop there wras a restless shuffling
of feet and the face of a young woman
peered into the ladies parlor-it was blood-
less strained and gaunt

  connors alone was master of his nerves
he had to be it was his business and
besides that he was a fatalist  you got
to let em pin crepe on the front door when
the undertaker comes was one of his pet
maxims

  all formalities were dispensed with by
the clean-cut representative of the law he
walked straight up to connors

   the captain wants to see you he an-
nounced

   sure responded connors replacing the
frayed cigar with a fat poisonous looking
member

   right away added the brisk minion of
the law

   of course replied connors who in
some respects was now at his best he had
no idea what the peremptory summons
might signify and at the moment did not
know what scheme of evasion he would em-
ploy if the captains object was to question
him concerning jakes mysterious enterprise
one thing however was certain this was
no raid on the cracker pot

  he moved toward the door with the offi-
cer standing near it was the cracker
pots oldest customer-joie the jug under
ordinary circumstances connors would have
ignored him but now he was willing to
capitalize even this small and meager asset
he was likewise desirous of flashing a mes-
sage to eddie carbon who had hurried for-
ward as soon as the first note of alarm had
reached the dance hall

  therefore in passing out connors patted
the forlorn weakling on the back and said
 look here joie how many times have i
asked you to quit spending in this place
you got a family joie and i hopes i wont
have to ask you no more to stay out of
here

  then with a warning wink to the negro
he added  eddie im going out for a few
minutes with my frien here so look after
all of my interests in the back room while
im gone-will yuh-eddie

  as connors passed out with his  frien 
the negro hurried into the dance hall where
he lifted a trap door in the rear of the
piano platform and disappeared into the
black shadows below

  on his way to the station house connorss
mind was active he was extremely anxious
to learn whether captain jakes nefarious
project had anything to do with what he felt
was to be a third degree session and won-
dered if the  special  at his side knew he
decided to approach the subject as adroitly
as possible

   did you see that black man he asked

   yes

   hes the best pianner tickler in america
he can choke a pianner to death with its
own harmony

  connorss jocularity was not drawing the
applause he anticipated but an overpower-
ing desire to coax the officer into conversa-
tion impelled him to blunder on  yep
hes a wonder aint had him long either
he came in on a schooner with a relative
of mine a trip around the world or some-
thin like that

  it was no use if this silent reserved
officer knew aught of captain jakes bold
venture or of connorss affiliated interests
it was not his intention to divulge it

  therefore silence reigned until they
mounted the station house steps between
the flickering green lights then he spoke

   wait here he commanded indicating
a small room opposite the captains head-
quarters

  a moment later the officer stood before
the desk

   did you bring him asked the captain
while a grim sort of smile flickered under
his heavy mustache

   yes sir

  tell me-have we got anything on
him

   very little hes clever and to a cer-
tain extent square the scum of the river
front gather there every night but some-
how he manages to hold them in line in
crafty rogues



starting a round-up its the first place i
look for my man as he will go there sooner

or later

    theyll nest there as long as the place is
open but scatter when its closed-is that
the idea

    yes sir

   well if we can keep a bit of wholesome
fear in this man connors it will serve our
purpose better to let him remain open for
a while at least but at the same time we
have got to make some concession to the
wave of reform that is now sweeping the
city the whole town has jumped into this
uplift game and it is growing by the
hour my friends uptown telephoned again
right after you left they wanted to know
if i had found a place for them this was
what i had in mind in sending for con-
nors some of the best people in new york
are behind the movement and i want them
to feel that the department indorses their
action

  here the telephone rang and the captain
picked up the receiver and listened atten-
tively

   not yet he said evidently responding
to some question  call me up in five
minutes yes i will be ready in that time

  again he turned to the plainclothesman

   the past record of this man can we
play it up

   thats the strange end of it hes
clean ill tell you what you can do though
rake up the reputation of the place before
he took it over

   fine-bring him in

  connors entered with the evident inten-
tion of sustaining his jocose mood his
mouth was set with a stage-property smile
that congealed into an expression of inde-
cision the moment he caught sight of cap-
tain wallerss stern countenance

  the officer who had ushered him into the
chamber of torture was an adept in the art
of administering all those chilling injections
which are supposed to benumb the human
ego upon such an occasion

   stand here he commanded  a little
farther over-there give me that hat
take the dribble of tobacco from your
chin

in the meantime the captain had not

deigned to look up when he finally did so
it was to plunge into his subject

   im getting some bad reports about you
connors and im thinking of closing you
up

  the perspiration could be seen to form
across connorss brow

   captain i tells you the truth-im
jumping in me sleep with nervousness to
keep that place right honest there aint
been no gents robbed or suicides or noth-
ing just ask the boys captain there
aint a scratch on the blotter against me

   whats that thundered the captain
 that place has given us more trouble than
any other resort in the precinct

   sure but captain i asks you please
give me a chance that was before my
time-honest 

  connors again turned to the officer

   did you see joie-the fellow i spoke
to hes an example of that place before
i came-lost all he had and now im trying
to make a man of him

    who ran that den before this man came
along asked the captain

   it was a gambling house answered the
officer  and must be crooked from the
foundation up because we made four raids
the year before you came to this precinct
and always found it empty by the time we
broke in

   order out a detail of men-i shall in-
vestigate that place myself

  if connors had turned white before he
was ghastly now the mere thought of
such a thing paralyzed him at an- other
time it might have been turned to his ulti-
mate advantage but now what sort of
an explanation could he make concerning
the revelations that would surely follow the
moment the captain entered the cellar under
the dance hall was ever a man in so much
trouble he thought what a horrible mess

  the minutes went by connors could
hear the preparations that were going for-
ward in the next room this was the end
so far as he was concerned

  again the telephone on the captains desk
rang

   hello-no-not yet said the captain
 but an idea has just come to me hold
the line a moment


argosy -allstory weekly

  then he turned to connors

 how large is that dance hall of yours
thirty by sixty replied connors

 how would a room thirty by sixty do
questioned the captain through the receiver

   yes-you can get that he added

  as he finished speaking connors noted
that his mood had changed

   i shall defer my examination of your
place connors for the present a personal
friend of mine uptown-a young clergyman
-wants to come down in my precinct to-
night and hold a mission service that was
him on the wire i want you to let him
have the cracker pot does it go

  at any other time connors would have
stood aghast at such a proposition but now
it loomed up in front of him as a miracle
this would give him time to think time to
locate captain jake and disentangle him-
self from an unsavory alliance certainly
the captains friend could have the dance
hall-why captain wallers had almost
asked it as a personal favor there was
no doubt in connorss mind as to what kind
of a man this gospel sharp was it was
quite clear to him he was a squirrel-a
bit of a religious nut but never mind cap-
tain wallers had made the request

  great possibilities began to swirl through
his mind what was the loss of one nights
receipts to the possible advertising that
might follow if newspaper row saw good
copy in this cracker pot meeting why
not boost it-make it a howling success
steve brody had to jump off the brooklyn
bridge before the silk hats and top coats
began to come down from fifth avenue
this would be soft in comparison

   leave it to me captain he replied with
a dramatic wave of the hand  leave it
to me ill make that bunch of dock rats
in the cracker pot get religion if you say
this bible-banger is on the level

   i guess they need it the captain an-
swered

  as connors went down the station house
steps the officer who had summoned him
turned to captain wallers whose face was
expanded in a huge grin

   not so bad-was it questioned the
captain

   i should say not responded the officer

	but if you had made your request without
setting up the scenery he would have re-
fused

   i was aware of that said the captain
taking up the telephone for the purpose of
notifying his friends that they might avail
themselves of the use of the cracker pot
for the proposed meeting

  as connors walked back to his establish-
ment confidence returned the mental jam
began to break up captain wallers did
not know of jakes mysterious use of the
dance hall cellar-that was the first big
stick to slide into placid waters and so far
as connors was concerned it was the key
log

  entering the dance hall he saw that the
flow of spirits both animal and distilled
had become normal under the inspiration
of eddie carbons music-some of his own
steam-drill compositions

  a few moments later both the negro and
emile went into secret conference with con
nors and were evidently satisfied with the
latters report and the declaration that so
far as his trip to the station house was con-
cerned  there was nothing to it

  then he made his way to the platform

   friens he began  you got to hand
it to chink-nail connors for keeping every-
body happy you know-just like one big
family and now you is all going to do me
a personal favor and maybe im going to
put your picters in the papers theres a
frien of mine uptown thats the barker for
a nice respectable congregation and he
says to me  connors i hears a whole lot
about your place and some night i want
to come down and put the gospel syringe
right into the hearts of them frien s of
yours

  -  certainly i says to him so hes com-
ing down to-night-see and we all got to
be nice and polite you know how it is-
some of you ought to get kind of sore
about your past life of course i aint go-
ing to ask no one to do anything thats
against his self-respect or nothing like that
but i got to do something that will be classy
-for my frien so im going to ask joie
to try and bust up the meetin-that 
give me a chance to run joie out and be
treatin this gospil man square
crafty rogues



   i ought to get about two dollars for
that-huh said joie from the audience

   leave it to me joie leave it to me
then if no one objects well have emile
come walking down to the platform unty-
ing his apron hes goin to walk right up
and say  im through wit rum that 
be a good one and now kind friens i
thanks you shoot a little harmony there
eddie will yuh

  to the credit of the nondescript assembly
of cracker pot patrons but one applauded
connorss announcement and that was joie
the jug whose monetary interest prompted
the outburst

  even eddie carbons masterpiece where-
in the correct staccato touch was secured
by shooting a bullet at the big brass gong
on the wall failed to dispel the near-gloom
that seemed about to settle

  of the forty odd men and women six
walked out

  much sooner than connors had believed
it possible the street door opened and cap-
tain wallerss official representative ushered
a small group of mission workers into the
cracker pot the party consisted of four
men and two women the former carried
a small portable melodeon which they
placed upon the dance hall platform

  the clergyman whom connors had desig-
nated as the bible-banger was a young
man not over twenty-six he was about
five foot ten in height and as clean as
the proverbial whistle in limb and carriage
as he walked to the rear of the hall connors
noted the free swing and springy step of a
man in perfect health

  there was no patronizing condescension
in the greeting he exchanged with connors
it was an honest grasp of the hand accom-
panied by a wholesome smile

    without confusion this little group seated
themselves on the platform and the clergy-
man assumed leadership

     miss danvin will sing for us he an-
nounced

    a young woman took her place at the in-
strument she was dressed in white and
every line of her face reflected idealism and
refinement

    as her mellow contralto notes voiced the
  words of a simple hymn silence reigned

  it was a voice rich in sympathy and it
carried the gracious personality of the sing-
er to every sin-tamished soul in the cracked
pot audience even connors recognized the
folly of attempting to stage his crude drama
of  repentant sinners

  emile had tiptoed his way into the bar-
room joie the jug had followed him

  connors found himself staring stupidly
at the young clergyman he seemed to be
fascinated where had he seen him before

  as the singer concluded there was a mo-
ment of silence and in that brief space
something occurred which startled every one
in the hall it was a low growl that appar-
ently came from beneath the floor and might
have emanated from a human throat except
for its peculiar volume this alone wtas
sufficient to alarm but accompanied as it
was by the distinct clank of a chain it
caused a thrill of apprehension to sweep
over the audience

  eddie carbon arose from his seat but
sank back as connors signaled him to re-
main quiet

  it was the training of the clergyman that
bridged the situation he was accustomed
to interruptions quick to divert the minds
of a distracted audience ignoring the
strange occurrence he stepped to the front
of the platform and began to speak

  there was no text no reduction of sacred
multiples by a common denominator of
slang no priestly monotones no eloquent
flights it was a simple talk as one who
would speak-man to man

   i have no patience with the man who
tells me that life is easy for i know that
there is a tragedy in every human heart if
i but knew some of you better i am sure
that i would find men of heroic mold i
believe that there are men here who would
go the limit to help a pal friends this is
the best within you coming to the surface
the bit of good within mankind-floating
because it was made to ride the troubled
waters listen men it is more it is gods
life preserver for humanity the life belt
that will hold you up until the great skip-
per sends out the long boat to rescue you
from the tempestuous seas

  in this simple fashion he ended his talk
and no one was more surprised than connors


argosy-allstory weekly

to discover that it was all over but there
could be no mistake the clergyman had
stepped down from the platform for the
purpose of shaking hands with his audience

  once more connors scrutinized the
clergymans face carefully where had he
seen him before one thing was certain-
it was during the pre-bowery days

    mr connors we want to thank you for
the use of your hall and hope that you will
allow us to come again i feel assured that
some of these people would favor me with
their friendship said the clergyman ap-
proaching connors

    sure they will responded the proprie-
tor  cernly theyll be friens wit you
say-if they likes you down here theyll
shoot th whiskers offen anybody thats sore
on you all you got to do is tell em-see
just point em out and say  theres a gent
whose face i dont like bing-off goes his
spinich

  whereupon the young clergyman gave
evidence of possessing the saving grace of
humor for he laughed-long and heartily

    thats fine he said  and now mr
connors i will bid you good night-come
and see me some time

   as the street door closed behind the mis-
sion party connors saw the folly of trying
to mix religion and pleasure in the cracker
pot punch bowl-at least from the stand-
point of profit within ten minutes the
place was empty eddie had made for the
trapdoor at the moment of the mission
workers departure emile was talking to
joie the jug-the only person in the bar-
room therefore connors seated himself
at one of the tables to think

   well hes scrapped the nights re-
ceipts was the burden of his intellectual
labor  but i like him whod a thought
it hes human

  just then one of the mission party re-
turned for some music which had been for-
gotten

   scuse me said connors  but what
synagogue does this preaching gent of yours
work in

   he is the pastor of a madison avenue
church was the smiling answer

   do you mind writing his name on a
piece of paper

   glad to do it

  without thanking him connors leaned
forward on the table and studied the bit of
paper occasionally he would lean back
and gaze at the ceiling then renew his fixed
attention to the name on the slip before
him at last a smile came over his face

   its him whod a thought it the
smart little divil

  the words were scarcely uttered when
a burly figure dropped into a chair on the
opposite side of the table then a second
stalwart chap appropriated the one next to
him following them came a third and
finally a fourth man

  they were the sailors who were so anx-
ious to meet captain jake

chapter iii

 the juggling sailor

they were as merciless a looking quar-
tet as ever trod the deck of a ship
grizzled dogs of the sea of an age now
long since passed

   hot rum is what we drinks and its go-
ing to be qn the house announced the lead-
er striking the table with his fists so hard
that even the matches seemed frightened
and jumped out of the conical little recep-
tacle which held them the other three
nodded in approval

  then all four glared at connors

   of course he replied  emile bring
four brimstones for th rummies

   and after that-four more shouted
the leader to emile

  connors had become hard as nails
selfishness might prompt him to whine a
bit when his personal interests were touched
but he was no coward far from it he
took a bunch of keys from his pocket threw
them on the table and with freezing sar-
casm remarked

    this one opens the front door that one
the safe and if youll run in to-morrow ill
introduce you at the bank

   cut th funny stuff warned the gruff
leader with a slicing thrust of his hand
across the board then he frowned at his
companions as if to assure them of his
frightful frame of mind
crafty rogues



   sure said connors  and now that
we all got seats we will ask the wild man
from borneo to bring out his little box of
tricks so the show can start what you
got up your sleeve

  where is captain jake asked the
leader leaning across the table

   i dont know was connorss curt re-
ply

  the big ruffian riveted his gaze on con-
nors as if he would draw the truth from
him at all hazards and his rage was fanned
by the evasive answer

   you lie he shouted

  connors was a prizefighter and these few
words had always formed the verbal prelude
that led to trouble in an instant he had
found his feet-and just as quickly changed
his mind and sunk back into his chair
there was nothing charitable about this
change of heart it had been prompted
by the persuasive powers of three wicked-
looking guns that had suddenly appeared on
the table

  the big sailor had not moved or shown
any excitement on the contrary he had
tilted his chair back and was smiling it
was a brutal sort of grin and at the moment
connors was fascinated by its glint of clev-
erness throughout the evening problems
had been assailing connors with great rapid-
ity and he therefore found it comparatively
easy to entertain another one who was
this big bmte of a sailor had he been a
member of captain jakes crew he
glanced at the fellows hands and was star-
tled to discover they were long and slim
they were deft and flexible while the hands
of his companions were tar-stained at every
crack and lin then again the mans
speech was not that of the water street
sailor it was too glib too oily by far

     i hopes you wont leave fore the show
is over the big one continued  we all
hopes that-dont we mates you see i
dont do no tricks i juggles

   he had brought his chair down again
  with all four legs resting on the floor and
  was leaning back in an easy attitude at
  the same time he had drawn a murderous-
  looking dirk from his belt and was toying
  with it

     i juggles-i does he repeated

  then without looking up but with eyes
fastened upon connors he tossed the ivory-
handled blade ceilingward as if it mattered
not how high it might soar or what might
happen

  connors followed the turning flashing
blade in its flight-saw it strike point up-
ward in the ceiling where it quivered for an
instant-then fell striking the table point
downward where it penetrated to the depth
of a full half inch

  it was the cold calculating precision of
the thing that made such an impression
upon connors

   now said the big fellow  i asks you
again-where is this here captain jake

  connors who had been weighing every
word and act caught the false ring of the
words  this here had this juggling sailor
been a member of jakes crew he would
have asked  where is captain jake

   looka here gents began connors
wishing to evade the issue  youre off your
course i aint no human lighthouse
whats the idea anyway coming to me

   easy answered replied the big chap

 we comes because you is the monkey
thats going to thrown down the coconut
you climbs the tree jake came to new
york because he knew that you were
crooked enough to help him put his deal
over-that was what he told us-not so
lads

  the three sailors nodded their confirma-
tion

   the minute he gets here he tries to
throw us dowti so we comes to you hes
a nice one he is to go and hide on his pals
but we knows whos going to smoke him out
yes sir 

  a brilliant idea came to connors he
would tell them the truth so far as he knew
it his faith in jake and his wild scheme
was on the wane the secret he was carry-
ing had become burdensome it was deep
stuff at best he could not grasp it be-
tween the revelations made in part by jake
the insinuations of emile the demands of
the sailors and captain wallerss threat to
give the cracker pot the regulation acid
test he was sick of it all as it stood they
all seemed to have more information than
he did all he knew was that jake had


argosy-allstory weekly

loaded him up with trouble let these salt-
air sniffers comb the boston harbor them-
selves if they wanted to find captain jake
so badly as for himself he was not sure
that jake had gone there if he could
have been fooled about washington emile
might have also been led astray concerning
boston at any rate the whole business
was slippery

    ill tell you the truth he said

    thats it-now we are getting a bit of
breeze in our canvas

    hes in boston

   thats it-thats it how soon can
you get him back to new york

  how soon say ive told you where
he is now go after him yourself

   nothing doing mr chink-nail we
dont do business that way we got to
stay right here under the coconut tree lis-
ten we gives you three days to bring him
back to new york three days mind you
and if you dont deliver this dog-eared skip-
per by that time we shoots the cracker
pot so full of holes it  look like a starry
night

   with this ultimatum they all arose and
walked toward the barroom while connors
remained seated at the table

   at the door they paused and the juggling
sailor collected the three guns one from
each of his companions following this he
motioned for them to stand aside then
with his right hand he began to juggle
with the three weapons-tossing them in
the air and catching them as easy as if
they were wooden balls

   as connors watched the sailor did some-
thing which startled him although he was
more or less familiar with the work of pro-
fessional jugglers

   in rapid succession without disturbing
the order of the revolving guns he had
fired each one as it came to his hand send-
ing each bullet with a crash against eddie
carbons musical gong and when the last
shot had been fired all three guns were
still circling through the air whirling about
in a drift of smoke

   as each bullet struck the bell clanged

    how many times did i ring the gong
asked the big fellow as he handed his com-
panions their respective weapons

   three was connorss prompt reply

   right-one for each day three of
em in which to produce this skunk of a cap-
tain

   here he bestowed a grin of confidence on
his villainous-looking companions after
which they walked out of the cracker pot

   connors remained seated at the table for
some time he thought that there might
be some trick involved and momentarily ex-
pected their return not until emiles face
appeared at the door did he move

   what did i tell you his bartender
questioned with brazen effrontery

   had connors followed his inclinations at
that particular moment he would have
licked his bartender and it is reasonable to
assume that the job would have redounded
to his credit as his nerves were a bit ragged
however wisdom prevailed

  he arose and went to the door where
emile stood

   did you ever read the lives of any of
the big captains of industry he asked ey-
ing emile menacingly

    certainly

   well all them fellows made big for-
tunes by minding their own business beat
it-ill ring a bell when i want you

  then he pushed him through the door-
way after which he locked the door

   again he seated himself at the table and
tried to catch some dangling thread of
thought that would help to unravel the fast-
tangling mass of mysterious events finally
he went behind the platform and rapped on
the trapdoor  come up eddie he called
in low tones

  the negro promptly responded to the
call

   did you hear any shooting asked
connors

   sure-somelxnly was bustin lead on
mah musical gong was carlxms reply

   eddie i want to ask you an important
question did you have a sailor on board
jakes schooner who could juggle with
knives and things

   sure-they was all jugglers on board
the bessie bowles sword swallowers wif
beans on em thats all

   nobody on board that could do any
fancy work you know- connors illus-
crafty rogues



trated by giving a dumb show of catching
objects from the air

   no boss nothin like that only just
dumb stuff
u then somebody is trying to put some-
thing over said connors

  once more he sat down to think while
eddie carbon returned to his charge

  for the first time connors was confused
he tried to recall the vague indefinite prom-
ises of fabulous wealth that had been made
by captain jake the details of which were
to be divulged as soon as the skipper re-
turned from washington bit by bit he
tried to piece it all together all the myste-
rious fragments starting with jakes voyage
from new york seven years before con-
nors was a younger man then and jake
had swayed his mind by wondrous stories
of adventure

  jake at that time was his idol he
winced as he thought of it could it have
been possible that he had actually been
so foolish as to induce some of his friends
to back jakes hair-brained scheme every-
body was to be made rich from that congo
venture jake could be trusted-he was
square the stuff was there and the dumb
natives did not know its value no one
really knew whether it was diamonds gold
or ivory but the stuff was there just wait-
ing for some one to come and scoop it
certainly jake knew-why he could have
married an african queen on one of his
trips if he had wanted to it sure was easy

  seven years-then jake showed up one
night could he make use of the cracker
pot certainly but what for oh he
would explain the whole thing next day

  that night jake reached the cracker pot
about  am extreme caution was neces-
sary jake would allow a light in the cellar
only had it not been for the corner street
lamp both the barroom and the dance hall
would have been in total darkness several
queer-looking bundles were carried in and
a host of foreign smells accompanied them
there were also vague shapes that silently
passed connors in the darkness the whole
thing was creepy and it made him uncom-
fortable-so much so that jake was afraid
he would weaken and told him to stay out
of the cellar

  just tend to your business and leave
everything to eddie carbon-that is what 
brought him along for jake had said and
now he had mysteriously disappeared for
the first time connors was just as anxious
as anybody else to locate this slippery skip-
per in fact it was absolutely necessary
to find him the worst of it was he could
not trust emile were it not for this he
would chance the boston trip and take the
midnight express

  he started to look at his watch and in
doing so became aware of the fact that the
little slip of paper with the clergymans
addresson it was still in his hand

  he slowly unrolled it

  then a smile broke over connorss wor-
ried face

   i got it and so help me bob ill do it
he exclaimed

  within a half hour connors boarded a
train at chatham square for the purpose
of executing what he considered to be a
most brilliant scheme

chapter iv

the ladies parlor

as his train rattled north through the
 bowery connors again studied his
bit of crumpled paper this was
the name written by the mission worker

the rev bruce de lisle

  if hes a regular guy hell do it mut-
tered connors

  at fifty-third street he left the train and
descending to the street once more examined
the valued slip of paper the address given
proved to be in one of the most aristocratic
sections of the city a part of new york
that had been erected in the brownstone age
--that pre-victrola and antipianola period
in which the silk hat and brewster carriage
were still found among the flora and fauna
of fifth avenue

  within ten minutes after leaving the ele-
vated station connors stood before the mas-
sive residence that had the honor of being
the rectory of the most fashionable church
in manhattan

  had the broad stone steps before him


argosy-allstory weekly

been the golden stairs they would have
made no greater impression on connors

    ill bet myself a new hat i dont get in
discouragement overwhelmed him as he
stood in the vestibule fumbling for the bell

  a moment later the door was opened by
a butler whose dignity was in keeping with
the correctness of his apparel for a mo-
ment it staggered connors to find himself
confronted by an array of brass buttons so
suggestive of the police department in
fact he missed saluting by a very narrow
margin

   is-the-er- he began edging nearer
the light so as to get the exact form of
clerical address from his paper

   the-er- he was forced to give it
up  you know-his nibs-is he in

   do you refer to the rev bruce de
lisle asked the punctilious butler

   sure tell his reverence that the hon
chink-nail connors of the cracker pot
cafe has came

  connors was trying to hide his embarrass-
ment under a cloak of paralyzing good
humor

   yes sir said the diplomatic servant
without moving an inch

   what you got-sore feet asked con-
nors sarcastically

   i beg your pardon sir whom did you
say had called

   they aint no  had  about it im
here now

   did you say  connors  asked the
horrified butler

   yes sweetheart

   very well sir hes in his study ill
see if it will be convenient for him to grant
an audience

   hold on exclaimed connors  lets
get a new deck and play the game without
the joker come out on the pezaza and
pipe the street they aint no audience
waiting to see him-just me chink-nail
connors-thats all

  by this time the unusual commotion at
the door had aroused the curiosity of bruce
de lisle and he came down from his study

   connors  he exclaimed  well-well
come in

  had he been one of the church wardens
connors could not have received a more

cordial greeting and soon found himself
seated in the aforesaid study on the second
floor

   now mr connors what can i do for
you asked the clergyman who although
a trifle nonplused by the speed with which
connors had accepted his invitation to call
was nevertheless prepared for almost any-
thing

  to his surprise connors was finding it
difficult to proceed seated on the edge of
his chair he was evidently undergoing the
tortures of uncertainty first he would grin
as if anticipating momentary recognition
then his hands as if conscious of their
valued aid to speech would attempt a
dumb show of responsiveness at last his
mouth opened

   i want you to come down and run the
cracker pot for me while i go to boston
said connors without batting an eye

  the rev bruce de lisle was a man of
keen perception he seldom made the error
of underestimating his man each human
unit that crossed his path was to be met
with an open mind considered without bias
he had no idea what was behind connorss
startling request but would treat the man
that had made it with respect the psy-
chological study alone would be worthy of
his patience and further interest

   why do you come to me connors a
perfect stranger with a request of this
character he quietly asked

  instead of answering connors gave a
hurried glance about the room then he
arose and opened the door leading to the
hall as if to make sure that the officious
butler was not within hearing

   mr bruce he began  you havent
got me and you didnt get me to-night
when i met you in the cracker pot but im
square and i got the goods wit me i asks
you fair-do you remember this

  pushing back the chairs he cleared a
small space in front of the now astonished
clergyman then he threw himself into the
aggressive crouch of the pugilist and as
light as a rubber ball danced about what-
to him-was evidently the focal center of
an imaginary punching bag his ease and
grace were phenomenal a veritable wildcat
on springs
crafty rogues



  as he paused there was an exclamation of
 recognition from the young clergyman

   that is jimmie connorss third lesson
 in shadow punching i did not recognize
 you

   sure said connors as they clasped
 hands

  even as connors had taken his  first posi-
 tion  the full significance of the strange
 request and the mans right to make it had
 swept through the mind of bruce de lisle
 but for the moment he was amused by the
 cleverness with which the memories of other
 days had been conjured up  the really
 good days true it was the big things
 that had made those student days at new
 brunswick worth while and connorss
 athletic club had no right to any such
 classification-all this he knew but the
 mere recollection of the fellows who used
 to gather there-the freedom from restraint
 -the tests of physical strength oh there
 were a thousand splendid memories that
 welled up

   one of his treasured photographs was
 that of an old building down on the river
 front near the bottling works a dingy
 butcher shop below-connorss club on the
 floor above

    do you remember the night i was in-
 troduced to the club connors he asked

    do i remember said connors  the
 night i tried you out-dont be afraid
 says i shoot out your mitt-im here to
 get killed i am and then-oh lizzie
 the mule kicked and the lightening came
 also the floor came up and stuck splinters
 in my curly locks and i went to sleep and
 heard the angels sing

   the rev bruce de lisle was enjoying
 the best all-around laugh he had indulged
 in for years-a laugh that was medicine to
 his bones the silliest kind of mirth tears
 were blinding his eyes

    and in due season-you came back
  added bruce

     sure in due season said connors  i
  lifts my head from the floor and asks  was
  many citizens killed by the earthquake 
   but it never made any difference in our
  friendship-did it questioned the smiling
  clergyman

    make any difference sure it made

a difference that was why i loved you
listen mr bruce im square i tells the
truth i does the day you took a chance
and bucked the river in the worst flood the
old town ever knew-you remember it-
you were all in and threw up your hands-
threw em up and yelled  help do you
know why i said my prayers quick and
kicked in after you mr bruce

    why connors

    because i remembered that punch

    and after you had rolled the yellow
waters of the raritan out of me i said

 connors you have saved my life call
on me whenever i can be of any service to
you 

   for the first time during the conversation
 connorss head sagged a bit

    thats whats bothering me mr bruce
i dont want you to think that im going
to rock the boat i-you know i cashed
in on that promise once before

   bruce smiled  you refer to my invest-
ment in the congo products company he
asked

   connors expressed his affirmation by a
sheepish nod that gave evidence of his em-
barrassment

   tell me continued bruce whatever
became of the seafaring relative of yours-
did he ever come back

   thats my trouble right now mr
bruce and this is the only time in my life
that i regrets my lack of education

   why connors

    i could do so much better if i knew
just what kind of nice polite cuss words
i could use in talking to you about this
yellow-skinned puppy-eyed soggy-

    easy connors interrupted the young
clergyman  i overheard part of your con-
versation at the door and on the strength
of that will suggest that we start all over
with a new deck-and make it a clean one
this time what has captain jake done
now

   as connors was about to launch out into
a full recital of his troubles the door bell
rang

    just a moment connors i think that
this caller is also an old friend of yours
andrew bailey-do you remember the
name


argosy-allstory weekly

  fat andy

	 yes i think we used to call him that
at new brunswick he usually drops in
saturday night and i know he will be glad
to see you do not hesitate about relating
your troubles concerning captain jake in
his presence as he will undoubtedly remem-
ber him

  as bruce de lisle surmised his caller
proved to be andrew bailey the self-ap-
pointed advisory board of one in the mun-
dane affairs of his clerical friend also
new york correspondent of the chicago
clarion

  the warmth of baileys greeting gave
connors the assurance he seemed to be in
need of whereupon he poured out his full
measure of woe as he concluded bruce de
lisle spoke

   but connors you have not made it
clear at all as to what the captain has stored
away in the cracker pot cellar

   do you know why asked connors

   i havent the slightest idea

   because im ashamed to tell you how
little i know about it and if i told you even
that much you might not go down

   and yet you ask me to assume this re-
sponsibility in your affairs without taking
me into your confidence you tell me that
some of my money helped to transplant
this so-called trouble from the french
congo to your establishment and refuse to
acquaint me with any of the details now
how do i know but that a degree of crim-
inal guilt will rest with me as the result of
my folly in becoming a party to it

   mr bruce began connors  wasnt
i square enough to poke my finger right
into the specked apple couldnt i have
jumped this cargo business if i was a trim-
mer honest would i dare ask you to
come down if i thought you would get in
trouble listen mr bruce captain jake
is crooked and i got you to put your money
into his deal yes i did and im ashamed
of it i tell you i got to find him so i can
break square with my friends got to find
him or the cracker pot will be riddled
got to find him in three days so i can hold
off this bunch of cutthroat sailors dont
you see the minute anything starts the
police will close me up mr bruce i needs

you now i does i needs you to watch a
thieving bartender needs you because you
can fix it with the police if they show up
before i get back captain wallers would

break a leg to help you mr bruce and-
honest-its outside th ropes for me if--
listen mr bruce you are the only white
man i know and i asks you-trust me till
i gets back from boston

  the rev bruce de lisle was in a quan-
dry by all the sacred rights of gratitude
this man was entitled to call upon him in his
hour of dire necessity this he knew he
was also aware of the folly of attempting to
discuss the ethics of ministerial propriety
with connors who considered that the
cracker pot was respectability personified

  as he weighed the consequences of this
temporary point of contact with the under-
world he saw that it had certain advantages
then again he realized that his consent was
made easier by virtue of the fact that he
had isited the place in his ministerial ca-
pacity had even expressed a desire to re-
turn at a later date

   what do you think about it andrew
he asked turning to his friend

   well do you acknowledge connorss
right to make this request

    i do said he with all the solemnity
of the marriage service

    can you square the job with your min-
isterial calling

    in view of the obligation-yes

    all right-that settles it i believe that
connors is telling the truth and accept his
reluctance to go into certain details-on
honor stand by him and if you want
any help from me im with you

  as had been said before connors was a
prizefighter but even this species of the
race is more or less human that was un-
doubtedly why connors wiped his emotional
nose

   listen mr bruce listen fat-ex-
cuse me andy-i mean mr baflev im
swallowing a lump as big as the city hall
clock i am-and i dont know what kind
of words to use but god love you for this
gents

   bailey arose and looked at his watch

   when do you start for boston he
asked

                    	a
crafty

rogues



   the first train out answered connors

   that will be with the newspapers you
have missed the midnight express my pro-
posal is this take us down to this place of
yours to-night so we can get the lay of
things before you go by the way will we
need a gun or anything like that

   not unless you want to practice on ed-
die carbons musical gong mr bailey the
cracker pot is as safe as a cradle

  who is eddie carbon asked bruce

   eddie is a harmony king he can play
a pianner upside down eddie can but im
going to tell him to lay off on the concert
work till i get back eddie wont bother
you and  - connors hesitated -  dont
pay any attention to him gents hes all
right but he dont talk much

  baileys suggestion to visit the cracker
pot met with bruces approval and connors
was anxious to draft some kind of note that
would excuse his absence to his bartender
without disclosing his destination he also
intended to incorporate within this note
some allusion that would reveal bruces
standing with captain wallers this was
to be written as soon as they reached the
cracker pot within twenty minutes they
were rolling southward in a night-hawk cab

  a dense fog was sweeping in from the
east river as they stepped to the curb
in front of the cracker pot it was a soggy
mist-dripping fog that cast huge halos of
light around each street lamp and inked the
shadows in every lane and alley now and
then a mass of shadow would assume human
form then slip past into the darkness

  after admitting them connors locked
the street door and handed the key to
bruce de lisle

   you may want it he said  there
are twto for this door emile has the other
one

  then connors passed from the barroom
into the ladies parlr where a dim light was
burning his companions waiting in the
semidarkness of the dingy barroom

  through the open doorway bruce and
bailey saw him lift his hand to turn on the
sickly looking jet of gas

  just what happened they did not know
but as his fingers touched the gas cock the
light went out

   	a

  their first impression was that he had
turned it the wrong way and they momen-
tarily expected the flash of a match this
conclusion was supported by the evidence
as there had been an exclamation of sur-
prise from connors and the sound of scrap-
ing feet against the bar floor after that
silence

  they waited in all likelihood not over
fifteen seconds had elapsed but it seemed
hours then bailey moved forward he was
in total darkness but by throwing out his
hands wras able to determine his position
he was close to one of the door posts

   do you want a match connors he
asked

  not a sound came from the back room

    connors what is it questioned bruce
who now stood at baileys side peering
into the darkness

   still no answer

  both the clergyman and his friend real-
ized the danger of their position without
firearms light or knowledge of their sur-
roundings and in one of the questionable
resorts of the city

    stand back said bailey  im going to
light a match and find out what has hap-
pened safe as a cradle he muttered
 a cradle of rattlesnakes

   the flickering light of the burning match
shaded by his hands was far more disquiet-
ing than the darkness had been as it allowed
imagination to people the dim recesses of
the room this however did not deter
bailey who cautiously advanced until he
stood directly underneath the burner they
had seen connors reach for then he real-
ized that the man had not made an error
of judgment in reaching for the light it
was flowing with the wicked hiss that ac-
companies the escape of unlighted gas
bailey touched his match to the burner and
a flood of light followed

  the room was empty

  writh one accord they reached for the
knob of the door which opened into the
dance hall assuming that connors had
stepped in there

  it was locked and they saw that the key
was on their side of the door

  at the left of the room was a door which
opened into the halhvay that led to the


argosy-allstory weekly

street this was also locked and the key in
evidence to proclaim the impossibility of
connorss disappearance in that direction

  their wonder grew as it dawned upon
them that there was not a window in the
room

  the scant furnishings were next consid-
ered there were three tables six chairs
and a refrigerator the latter was about
four feet wide six in height and perhaps
two deep it was packed with a general
stock of saloon merchandise bailey opened
the comparatively small refrigerator door
and a bottle slipped to the floor

   it would have been a physical impos-
sibility for him to have disappeared in this
direction said bruce

  finally they examined the floor-foot by
foot not so much as a loose board was in
evidence

  it seemed quite beyond belief that a man
could disappear so quickly and silently

   he must have passed you in the dark-
ness said bruce

    never i was too close to the door but
suppose we examine the barroom

   the search proved to be a fruitless one

   he must have slipped past us and made
for the street through the front door said
bailey

    impossible replied bruce  i have the
key in my pocket-connors locked the door
behind him the minute we stepped inside-
he could not have disappeared by way of
this front room

    listen whats that exclaimed bailey

   as they listened-in silence straining to
register the full significance of the shout
that had startled them-they distinctly
heard the call  bruce-bailev-help-
help

  it was connorss voice outside in the
street and was followed by subdued mutter-
ings and the sound of scuffling feet

chapter v

a chamber of horrors

even a clergymans fingers may func-
tion as thumbs under the stress of in-
cidents so exciting and precious time
was lost as bruce fumbled with the door

the lock was ancient and the key was cum-
bersome

  once it was opened they fairly tumbled
out of the cracker pot only to find that
they were engulfed in a mass of drifting
fog the street lamps no longer battled for
recognition but had succumbed they were
mere negations of light value in the con-
fusion and uncertainty bailey grasped the
arm of his friend

    dont move until we get our bearings
he whispered

  from some point within the blinding fog
they caught the sound of heavy blows
rough oaths and gruff voices

   this way said bruce starting diag-
onally across the street

  not until they had reached the opposite
curb did they discover that their direction
was wrong then through a rift a mo-
mentary lifting or drawing of the moist
curtain they saw an indistinct blur that
might have been a cab or carriage and
heard the muffled voices of men within it
likewise the bang of a closing door after
that the rumble of wheels over the cobbles
and the galloping clank of iron-shod hoofs
growing fainter in the distance moving on
into the blackness of the night

   that was all

  standing there in the drip and gloom
bailey took a cigar from his pocket and
lighted it with exasperating coolness

   sorry you dont smoke old man said
he  awfully comforting you know some-
times

  bruce de lisle did not attempt an imme-
diate response when he did there was a
note of helplessness in his voice

    what are we going to do he asked

   going to do exclaimed bailey  we
are going to lock up this palace of mirth
across the street and go home

   think you can sleep asked bruce

   certainly-thats one of the compensa-
tions of being fat besides that i have
a trick brain a delicate subcellar lobe that
will dig the lining out of any problem over-
night come on-its getting ready to agi-
tate

    that mind of yours will probably be of
great value to us andy said bruce aa
they recrossed the street and entered the
crafty rogues	

cracker pot u but there are a few fun-
damentals we ought to establish before
banking on this accommodating lobe of gray
matter

    for instance questioned bailey

  to start with was connors kidnaped
or did he disappear in accordance with some
prearranged plan of his own

   kidnaped-some one wanted him and
they got him his call for help proves that
furthermore he came here with us because
we asked him to it was his intention to
go direct to the grand central station and
take the first express for boston

   that sounds fair enough was bruces
comment  do we want to spend any time
on the question of who got him and what
they want him for

  no we do not in my opinion we
should dismiss that for the present the
next three days may help us to solve that
section of the problem just now we better
stick to our known facts we agree that
he was kidnaped and that it was his voice
we heard calling for help also that he
was spirited away in a cab

    correct

    the mystifying part of it to me is this
granting that they got him out of the back
room by some means unknown to us how
did they manage to reach the street

    i give it up replied bruce

    and i admit that it is too deep for me
said bailey  ive had them pull coins out
of my ears and ducks out of my silk hat but
i never supposed it was possible to whisk
a man right out of a room while looking
at him

   further speculation being useless they
locked up the cracker pot and started for
home with the understanding that bailey
was to take breakfast with bruce in the
morning

  therefore at  am they were seated in
the dining room of the rectory for a brief
discussion of their future plans first of
all bailey was to call upon captain wal-
lers and relate the peculiar circumstances
under which bruce had become obligated to
connors and to inform him of the latters
strange request and bruces consent they
agreed that it would not be wise to mention
connorss mysterious disappearance as it

would defeat the mans object in calling

upon bruce for assistance the conference
was short as sunday morning hardly

seemed to be an appropriate time for bruce
to concentrate upon connorss sordid affairs

  about an hour later bailey delivered
bruce de lisles message to captain wallers
who seemed both pleased and amused at the
loyalty of his clerical friend

    tell him not to worry said he  the
chances are that the place will be as quiet
as a sunday school this man connors
is as square as a business of that character
will allow him to be but sooner or later
we will have to clean him out

  bruce had agreed to meet bailey at the
cracker pot by ten oclock on monday
morning which gave him ample time to fol-
low his usual custom of spending an hour
in the gymnasium associated with the parish
house community service where to the
consternation of the staid board of govern-
ors he sometimes instructed the young men
of his church in the  manly art

  upon entering the cracker pot they
found emile industriously polishing sundry
bottles and brasses behind the dingy bar
in front of it a blear-eyed wreck was plying
a short rake over the sawdust-covered floor
it was joie the jug

   i am a friend of connors said bruce
to emile by way of introduction

    yes sir was emiles response

   hes gone away for a few days con-
tinued bruce scrutinizing the mans face
for the purpose of trying to discover how
much he knew concerning the sudden de-
parture of his employer

  one of emiles tricks was to assume the
mask of dull stupidity when in doubt and
this he now attempted but there had been
one fractional moment of uncertainty and
in that brief space bruce noted the glint of
satisfaction in emiles eye

   i am here with the knowledge and con-
sent of captain wallers he added  and
in a general way will look after the business
during his absence

    yes sir

   this terminated the verbal preliminaries
between them each had taken his measure
of the other

   directly after this bailey left after agree-


argosy-allstory weekly

ing to return late in the afternoon and
bruce seated himself at one of the little
tables where he spread out certain papers
he had brought with him but work was out
of the question-the atmosphere was all
wrong

   the first thing to divert his atention was
the negro eddie carbon was uneasy his
black face reflected a weight of responsi-
bility a dozen times he disappeared
through the trapdoor behind the platform
which was not twelve feet from the table at
which bruce was seated it was the shrill
tremulous note of a female voice that
brought him to his feet there was no mis-
taking the sound or from whence it came
carbon had just closed the door over his
head as he descended the ladder or steps
leading to the mysterious chamber below

   the quavering notes of anger or fear-
bruce knew not which- had scarcely died
out when he stood over the small trapdoor
a great revulsion of feeling was sweeping
over him alert tense and with tread as
soft as that of a stalking tiger he encircled
the rough-planked door waiting for-he
scarcely knew not what

   chinks of light could be seen through
the cracks and crevices he bent over to
lift the door and as he did so heard the
soft crooning tones that only a negro can
express

   bruce hesitated three things restrained
him first the doubt that he had heard
aright after all it might have been the
negro second the wisdom of inviting a
disastrous conclusion to any adventure that
might be sure of success with baileys as-
sistance a thought which was far from be-
ing an idle one as emile was watching every
movement he made his last restraining
thought was based on his promise to con-
nors-a promise from which he was un-
doubtedly absolved by the strange disap-
pearance of the man who had exacted it
but nevertheless a promise

   standing there uncertain but active of
mind he distinctly heard that which star-
tled him it was the snapping of teeth ac-
companied by a growl a deep-rumbling
snarl more animal than human

  if an opportunity had been given to
bruce to lance the fast-ripening cracker

pot mystery he had missed it as emile was
advancing to the platform with joie acting
as a rear guard but the campaign had
evidently been mapped as a strategic one
it was for the purpose of drawing bruce
from the danger zone as was shown by the
pail and mop which joie carried

   we always cleans up in here on mon-
days said emile  youll have to move

   perhaps it was a full appreciation of the
responsibility associated with the part he
was to play that caused joie to bungle his
act at any rate his clumsy efforts met
with disaster bruce was supposed to re-
treat under the menace of joies industrious
mop and this was what he did hence
the splendid confidence of joie as shown by
the swirling strokes of his mop one of
which overturned his pail

   a torrent of black billingsgate slipped
from emiles glib tongue it was lurid

   bruce clenched his hands until the nails
bit into his palms but the outburst meant
nothing to joie except to add to his con-
fusion this it did and to the point of
confusion confounded for he again lost the
ability to measure distances accurately and
brought his wet mop against emiles im-
maculate white apron

   with an oath the bartender wrenched the
mop from his hands and the next instant
had struck the unoffending weakling a blow
that broke full across his forehead-as
brutal as it was unnecessary

   bruce de lisle never hesitated for a min-
ute there was one quick stride one de-
lightful right-arm swing and one beautiful
smash between emiles eyes

   emiles first imitation was that of a wind-
mill he was on his way and his arms were
wildly thrashing the air about the time
he was ready to land among a pile of chairs
at the side of the hall he doubled up jack-
knife fashion all of which was quite ap-
propriate in view of the splintered kindlings
his fall produced

    you miserable skunk was the highly
improper clerical epithet used by bruce as
he stood over emile

   dazed but disillusioned emile rested
among the splintered legs and rungs of the
cracker pot chairs the ethics of the thing
was all quite new to him quite anticlerical
crafty rogues



   and irregular but certain primitive instincts
 had always prevailed so far as the law of
 self-preservation was concerned and he
 knew when he had enough

    all right if you say so lemme up
im through

   without offering to assist him to his feet
 bruce waited until the subdued bartender
 had disentangled himself and was standing
 before him then he indulged in another
 highly unprofessional remark  beat it he
 exclaimed quick

   without a word emile limped back to his
 official headquarters with a clearer vision
 of the full scope and magnitude of the min-
 isterial calling

   then bruce applied himself to the dress-
 ing of joies lacerated forehead-a service
 which was amply repaid by the gratitude of
 his patient-a dumb animal-like response
 that was pathetic and although bruce was
 not aware of it his kindly act was destined
 to arouse the lethargic joie to some show
 of appreciation before the night was over

   the morning hours passed all too slow
for bruce time had become a laggard
the afternoon proved to be equally as dull
and commonplace but six oclock did even-
tually come and bruce hurried out to sup-
per

   it was eight thirty when he returned to
 find that bailey had not put in an appear-
 ance there were but a few people in the
 cracker pot at that hour but shortly after
 nine oclock several women entered and
 their easy familiarity indicated that they
 were regular habitues of the establishment

  following them came a young woman
whose appearance riveted bruces attention
her swaggering boldness attracted him first
the rakish tilt of her sailor hat the short
blue jacket with its snappy pockets where-
in she had thrust her hands with sufficient
energy to crack the seams

   he thought that he had never seen any
specimen of young womanhood quite so
hard so utterly void of the conventional
feminine graces the very swing of her
skirt as she walked to one of the empty
tables was aggressive and defiant

   as bruce scrutinized her face for the tell-
 tale lines of degeneration he believed would
 be in evidence he was surprised to note a

 profile that suggested the opposite of those
 things which are base and low he saw
 the quick emotional play of a sensitive
 mouth and wondered if it was possible that
 she had deliberately chosen the companion-
 ship of those about her

  then he noted the deftly bound coil of
hair that was tucked under the broad-
brimmed hat it was brown like the russet
tones of autumn

   she was evidently conscious of his mascu-
line appraisement and seemed to be anxious
to avoid any possible acknowledgment of
it that would signal her approval in fact
she evinced a degree of embarrassment quite
foreign to cracker pot society

  was it real or feigned bruce did not
know

  while attempting to solve the problem
something occurred which caused him to
speculate anew

  eddie carbon had once more emerged
from what bruce now designated the
 chamber of horrors

  instantly the young womans attitude
changed she was no longer playing a
part the negros appearance was a revela-
tion to her or it might have been that he
stood for a confirmation of her fears-pos-
sibly her expectations with evidence of
suppressed excitement she leaned forward
and watched him from the moment of his
appearance until he disappeared through the
street door her face was registering the
keenest satisfaction

  bruce had began to suspect that he was
involved in a situation far more complex
than he imagined up to the moment his
interest in the cracker pot mystery had
been passive he had been content to
wait developments he had reasoned
that no matter what might occur it
was connorss problem and all of the
characters involved belonged to the under-
world but here was something new-some
evidence of interest in connorss affairs by
one who reflected both culture and refine-
ment try as she might to disguise it

  he arose and walked toward the table at
which she sat but did so without any defin-
ite idea of what he intended to say after
his arrival

  as his hand was on the chair at her side

when the stranger alighted from
the stage sheriff jim harpers
first feeling was one of surprise
that such an obviously refined and educated
girl should wish to stop at the wild railroad
construction town for even a single day
storekeeper joe blundell had just been tell-
ing him that he had felt obliged to send his
wife and daughters to helena to live be-
cause of geysers swift retrogression from a
respectable dry farmers trading point to a
hell of iniquity since work on the b and

want it blundell told her

   why not

  harper noted that her tone betokened de-

termination as well as culture her very
attractive eyes seemed unusually somber
and serious and there was a trace of anxiety
in her fine features her tailored suit was
as businesslike as it was well-fitting

   well you see- blundell looked em-
barrassed  this town miss-it isnt the
kind of burg you probably think it is-not
the sort of place it used to be by a long
shot its tough miss so tough that i
had to send the missis and girls away till the
railroaders get out all those buildings you
see down there -he waved his hand-
 are just saloons and low dance halls and-
er-all that sort of thing

   i think i understand is the vacant
building situated near those places

   yes-thats why i dont think you
want it

  the girl smiled in a mysterious manner
that increased sheriff harpers interest in
her

   on the contrary that is a point in its
favor may i see the place are you the
agent

   i am miss and you may blundell
noted a possible customer weaving his way
storeward and turned to harper

   you show her the shack jim youre
not busy

   sure said the sheriff  come along
miss

   miss juno said the girl  since i am
going to become a resident of your interest-
ing little town i suppose youll have to learn
my name sooner or later

  harper removed his huge sombrero in a
courtly manner as he in turn told her his
name but not his business

  courtliness was inherent in geysers
sheriff even to the poor drabs who in-
fested the lowest dance hall his manner
was chesterfieldian in other ways also he
differed from the ordinary run of geyser
men his strong features were always
clean-shaven his heavy blond hair was
combed and brushed his boots were shined
the hands that could whip out six-guns or
bind an injured dogs leg with equal facility
were as clean and muscularly sensitive as
those of a master pianist

   are you going into business miss
juno he queried as they proceeded toward
the cluster of rough and unpainted struc-
tures that had given geyser its present evil
name

   yes said the girl shortly as though
her attention were too much engrossed with
the sights about her to permit of conversa-
tion

  in truth these sights were sufficient to
claim the attention of even a woman hard-
ened to life in a railroad camp during that
lawless period in montanas history

  on both sides of a dusty thoroughfare
that did not even boast a sidewalk a num-
ber of hastily carpentered structures stuck
up like sore fingers rough-boarded unpaint-
ed unspeakably crude and garish in the
glare of broad daylight the camp was
quiescent now here and there a besotted
individual snored in the unshine his back
against one of the buildings his head on
his chest occasionally a dance hall deni-
zen kimono-clad and looking ghastly with-

out her make-up flitted from one den to an-
other heaps of tin cans and litters of

rubbish offended the eye at every turn

  with the coming of night things would
be different darkness would hide the ugli-
ness lights would blaze hard-faced harpies
would again resemble real women raucous
laughter would mingle with the blare of
musical instruments roulette balls would
whir and click dancing feet would scrunch
the floor money would jingle on the long
counter of the lone star saloon and dance
hall the proprietor dan sherrard would
smile in his usual oily manner and pour in-
gratiating phrases of false fellowship into
the ears of poor fools from the camps

  harper did not fail to observe that miss
juno shuddered and her lips tightened and
looked hard and determined as she neared
the vacant shack opposite the lone star

   thats the place he said  if you
want an observation post for a close view
of hell i can recommend it highly

  she glanced through a dusty window into
the bare interior and before harper had
even opened the door she answered  its
just what im looking for

   she examined the inside of the little cabin
and again smiled with satisfaction harper
looked at her more closely than before his
curiosity was increasing

   you wish to five here he queried

   live here and work here too the
strange girl answered

    conduct a little store of some sort may-
be

   xo not a store

  they left the place and headed back to-
ward blundells

  one of the dance hall women shuffled
around a corner and almost ran into them
miss juno shrank back and clutched har-
pers arm in an involuntary gesture of re-
pulsion

  what a horrible creature she ex-
claimed

  the woman glared and passed on and
the girl quickly let go of harpers arm as
she realized what she was doing

  in the mind of an ordinary man the in-
cident would have banished any atom of
doubt that miss junos proposed business
might be open to question the girl was
the storm woman



 too plainly disgusted with the evidences of
 iniquity on every side in harpers mind
 it banished no atom of doubt for the sim-
 ple reason that he had never entertained
 any

     if youre not going to open a store
 maybe its an office to sell stock or some-
 thing he ventured

     no came the quick answer

     youre going to start some sort of clean
 and innocent amusement

     the shack isnt big enough for anything
 like that

     well then youre a missionary of some
 sort even though you dont look it

    miss juno slowly shook her head

     my mission here she stated  is to
 make money

    her replies to his queries were mystify-
 ing harper said nothing for a while

    i dont wish to appear curious- he
 began haltingly

    the girl cut in with a rippling little laugh
 that was as musical as the tinkle of a
 flower-bordered brook  ive noticed that
 he felt foolish

    youve got me there miss juno he
 admitted  i am curious i would like to
 know your business in this hell hole in a
 way its my duty to learn it living alone
 in that shack directly opposite the largest
 and worst of all the dives you will be in
 danger and it will be my job to protect
 you

 the girl whirled upon him

  who are you that you should talk
 about protecting a woman you dont know

  i am the sheriff of carson county

 in the silence that followed this announce-
 ment harper could hear miss junos sharp
 intake of breath she was staring at him
 he thought that she paled and looked
 alarmed but before he could make sure of
 it she regained her poise with a laugh

  that being the case i take it all back
 she said  nevertheless i dont need your
 protection as for disclosing my business
 here this will tell you all that i wish to let
 anybody know for the present

 she handed harper a printed circular
 and he read it slowly and wonderingly

 it stated that on the following saturday
 night at  pm miss alice juno would open

  an office and in a speech from her door
would announce her business in geyser so
far as she knew no similar business had
ever been started at any railroad grading
camp before she expected to render a
service to the railroad workers and she
hoped to merit their patronage at the
bottom was a blank line on which the loca-
tion of her office would be filled in with a
pencil

   i got those prepared in advance i in-
tend to have them distributed at all the
near-by camps she stated

   good idea approved harper  curi-
osity will bring you a crowd all right-that
and your location opposite the lone star

  he expressed his willingness to do any-
thing he could for her but she declined
his offer with thanks and during the re-
mainder of the day and the days that fol-
lowed she proceeded to carry out her plan
whatever it was with energy and efficiency

  harper made no further effort to pry
into her affairs but he could not help
noticing that she engaged the livery stable
to cart a sizable trunk and a typewriter as
well as a cot table and some household
utensils to her new dwelling the type-
writer was the only clew in sight to indicate
her proposed enterprise and it was a poor
clew writing machines are used in almost
every line of business even sherrard the
lone star proprietor possessed one

  in her office alice juno worked behind
drawn shades and kept her doors locked
her handbills were distributed and the men
got to talking about her curiosity mount-
ed and indications were that quite a gather-
ing would be in front of her office on satur-
day night incidentally saturday was the
last day of the month and therefore pay day

  but no ones curiosity was quite so great
as that of sheriff jim harper

ii

  alice junos artful arousing of public
curiosity did its work long before eight
oclock on saturday night men began to
gather in front of her office to guess at the
nature of her speech

  under-sized mule skinners from the grad-
ing machine camps were there in their dirty


argosy-allstory weekly

sweat-stained clothes intelligent looking en-
gineers and cranesmen from the steam-
shovel cuts well-dressed and clean-shaven
muckers and dump men slouching around
with the mud and grime of their occupation
still upon them timekeepers and clerks in
sport shirts and riding breeches cooks
and flunkeys stablemen and blacksmiths-
all the different workers from all the differ-
ent camps within fifteen miles or more as
the hour for the unknown girls speech ar-
rived they milled around in front of her
door like baseball enthusiasts before a score-
board

  from the door of the lone star saloon
across the street sheriff jim harper
watched the proceedings he tried to ap-
pear nonchalant and unconcerned but really
he was on pins and needles of expectation
alice juno interested him immensely he
admired her and he respected her he won-
dered how many of the men in the street
possessed the nerve to do what that frail
girl was doing-start a new business in a
hell hole like geyser and make a speech
to a crowd such as that her object he
reasoned must be stronger than the com-
monplace one of earning a living

  the saloon was practically empty even
the women habitues wide awake now and
more or less resplendent in powder paint
and tawdry finery were outside awaiting the
unknown girls speech the proprietor
dan sherrard joined harper at the door
and gazed across the street with no excess of
good will

   hits your business quite a wallop eh
sherrard harper queried

   only for the moment sherrards tone
was contemptuous  shell say her little
say-so whatever it is and then theyll come
piling in here

  promptly at eight oclock the door of the
mysterious shack flung open and alice juno
stepped to the front of a tiny platform in a
manner so sudden and dramatic that the
crowds attention was caught immediately

    friends she began without an instants
hesitation  all of you want to write lots
of letters to friends and relatives back home
but you dont do it you write only a few
or none at all why because conditions
in the camps are against it there are no

desks to write on there is too much noise
to think you are tired after a hard days
work your fingers dont handle a pen read-
ily and chances are there is no pen to han-
dle if there is the ink is missing or
theres no note paper or envelopes or stamps
or something else you keep putting off
the job until finally its been put off so long
that youre ashamed to write

   naturally if you dont send letters you
dont get any and then you think that no
one cares about jou you are wrong my
friends no matter who or what you are
no matter how alone and friendless you may
think you are there is some one who care
more for you than for any one else on gods
green earth i want you to write to that
person whoever it is and to all your other
friends as well and it is in order to make
writing easy for you that i have set up in
business here i am a professional stenogra-
pher and typist and i want you to write
your letters through me

  she paused and harper overheard com-
ments

   good idea that

   she sure said a mouthful

  alice continued

   perhaps the person who is longing to
hear from you is a brother or a sister a hus-
band or wife a father or a mother a
mother do you hear that i wonder hovr
many of you have mothers to whom you
have not written in weeks or months or
years if you have dont you know that
she wants to hear from you you do know
it then why not write

  if you have prospered no one will be
so glad to hear it as your mother if you
havent-if you have gone down and down
until perhaps you are even living a life of
shame and disgrace-she still wants to hear
from you if you are ashamed to tell the
truth about yourself-dont tell lies tell
anything just so she will know you are
alive if you cant think of anything to
say i can and will dont you realize that
even one short line from the child she
brought into the world may mean all the
difference to a mother between dreary days
of melancholy and hopeful weeks of happi-
ness

  in front of harper and sherrard one of
the storm woman



  the tawdry women wheeled suddenly and
  stumbled into the dance hall handkerchief
  to her eyes sobbing hysterically

     mother oh gawd i cant stand
  that she pitched into a chair head
  buried in her arms her bare shoulders heav-
  ing convulsively

     sherrard jerked her to her feet  shut
  your trap babe an get t hell outa here
  he gave her a shove toward the rear

     harper joined the crowd another dance
  hall woman was sniffling a great hairy
  brute of a man pulled a red handkerchief
  from his pocket and blew his nose loudly
  as men will when emotion clutches them
  even harper the hardened man-hunter
  who wrote his mother as regularly as the
  stage traveled felt a lump rise up in his
  throat as the sad-eyed girl in front con-
  tinued to utter one homely truism after an-
  other her conquest of her audience was a
  full and complete as though she were the
  greatest orator in america

      as i said i didnt come here to lecture
on love but to make money alice went
on  so heres my proposition write your
letters through me no bother no fuss with
ink pens and paper sit down beside
my desk and talk as though your loved one
were beside you easy and naturally and
every word that you utter will be typewrit-
ten by me just as fast as you speak it
when you have finished sign your name at
the bottom and the deed is done ill at-
tend to the mailing ill furnish envelopes
and postage that is my proposition folks
a plain business offer fifty cents a page
double-spaced is my charge-worth five
hundred dollars maybe to the one who re-
ceives it thats all ive got to say op-
erations begin right now first come first
served line forms on the right all ready
lets go

  there was an outburst of applause as
with a smile she backed into her tiny office
and seated herself at her typewriter

  a man near the door entered and took the
chair beside her desk a line quickly
formed harper did not join it but he
stepjed to the office door to obtain a better
view

  the first correspondent was gazing at
the ceiling and speaking as though the per-

  son he was addressing was in the room
  his tongue clattered along at a rapid rate
  but not too rapid for the operator who
  recorded it direct on the machine with a
  degree of speed that stamped her an expert
  the man wound up in a flurry of words ac-
  companied by a grandiloquent waving of his
  hands one of which just missed the typists
  cheek and then he slowly read his literary
  effort

   holy mackerel he exclaimed
   whod a thought letter-writing is as easy
  as that he signed his name and paid
  his money throwing in an extra half dollar
  for a tip then made way for the next in
  line

    harper moved back into the crowd of
  spectators who were not awaiting their turn
  and stood there as pleased as a baseball
  fan whose team has won the worlds series
  he overheard various comments

      great stuff

     she ought to make money at it

      ill say the girl has nerve

      just the same shed better watch out or
  sherrard will get her

    the last remark prompted harper to
  step across to the dance hall and take a
  look inside only a few patrons were in
  the place sherrards scowl was an inch
  deep harper left and resumed his obser-
  vations outside

    suddenly a crash sounded in the letter-
  writers office and a shriek that was instant-
  ly muffled was heard above the blare of the
  lone star music it motivated jim har-
  per as an electric flash sets off dynamite
  like a wild elephant he tore through the
  crowd hurling men aside in his mad pro-
  gress fighting plunging until he reached
  the place

     alice was gazing wild-eyed at her type-
 writer which lay on the floor half a
 dozen men were holding a rat-faced indi-
 vidual who protested loudly that he had
 not meant to tip over the little table on
 which the machine had rested harper
 recognized him as a porter in sherrards
 employ

   he set the machine back on the table and
 noted that while it was out of commission
 for the evening it was not broken beyond
 hope of local repair


argosy-allstory weekly

    never mind well get another he said
to alice then to the crowd

   dont go away business as usual in
a minute

  he interrogated the porter and specta-
tors sharply but no proof that the toppling
of the typewriter on the floor was other
than an accident was forthcoming so he re-
leased the fellow

  he crossed the street to the lone star
and accosted the proprietor

    sherrard he said  youve got a type-
writer that youre not using at present id
like to borrow it for miss juno

  the dance hall man sneered  thats
nerve for you he said  that cursed girl
has ruined my business for the night a
lot of those idiots who fell for her mush
are sending money away that would be
spent here and yet when she meets with
an accident you want me to assist in my
own ruin by loaning her my typewriter
harper bored sherrard with eyes that
were like points of steel

   right away please the words
cracked like a whiplash   return it to-
morrow

  sherrard consented then and the sheriff
carried the borrowed typewriter across to
the new office where alice juno was writ-
ing meanwhile with a pen he stated that
he would be around next day to repair her
broken machine

iii

  writh a few simple tools harper per-
formed his task the following morning then
sat down for a chat with the most interest-
ing young woman he had ever met

  alice juno was very charming on this
occasion success in her business venture
has chased some of the wistful sadness from
her eyes but she was still a bit more sober
and serious than any woman in her early
twenties ought to be

   do you know im still puzzled about
you harper told her  i dont know
what to make of you

   why make anything

   because i think you are in trouble of
some sort and i want to help you

   i have not asked for help

 proud young women rarely do seek it

in the first place harper went on 
cannot bring myself to believe that you are

here simply to make money

    i like to think that i will bring a bit
of happiness into this sad world also

   yes-but there is more to you than
that you made a lot of money last night
and you created a lot of happiness but still
you are troubled and unhappy i think
miss juno that you are here for some mys-
terious reason that you are unwilling to
disclose

  alice rose and gazed out of her open
door then turned and replied

   you seem concerned why

    i am afraid that something will happen
to you you are too pretty a woman to be
alone in a place like geyser

    i can take care of myself

   harper had also risen

    my dear miss juno he said very earn-
estly up on the hillside back of this town
there is a bleak and desolate patch of ground
with little mounds hang side by side and
at the head of each mound there is a plain
piece of board penciled with the name of a
person who thought he was capable of tak-
ing care of himself already you have
made a vicious and powerful enemy here
i cannot prove that dan sherrard was back
of the accident to your typewriter last night
but-

   he stopped surprised by the girls quick
change of expression seeing that he no-
ticed her emotion she turned quickly away
then faced harper again with the best imi-
tation of a smile that she could muster

   that graveyard-it must be interesting
-id rather like to see it she said with
pseudo nonchalance

   of course why not go up with me
now youll not get much business this
morning

    i will

   she locked her office and they sauntered
to the foot of a sun-baked butte where in-
side a fenced inclosure six or seven ugly
mounds of raw earth uplifted themselves
the girl proceeded directly to the board at
the head of the first one and read the fast-
fading name that had been rudely penciled
thereon

   in turn she looked at each of the other
the storm woman



   boards harper thought that she seemed
 relieved as she turned away from the last
 one and remarked that she ought to be get-
 ting back

    i guess the reason i have taken such an
 interest in you is that i myself was an
 odd bird when i hit this country he ex-
 plained  you may find it hard to believe
 but im an easterner just as you are
 somehow i didnt seem able to fit into the
 ordered life of the country town where i
 was bom too slow for me i had to have
 excitement and i got it in ways that were
 disapproved of when folks began to refer
 to me as a black sheep i figured it was time
 to light out so i lit

    are you inferring that i am an odd
 bird one of her rare smiles lighted up
 alices fair features

    you are mysterious and that is odd
 you are beautiful and that is an attribute
 of most birds

   her smile was wiped off like chalk marks
 on a blackboard  i must ask you not to
 speak in that manner mr harper

    then how about this manner harper
 did not look like a man-hunter now a
 very tender expression was in his winning
 eyes  i love you alice and i want you to
 marry me that may seem sudden but it is
 the truth i want to shoulder your burden
 whatever it may be i want you to be
 happy i am not a black sheep really i
 would be very good to you alice

 she looked at him in a sad and wistful
 manner  i-i appreciate your offer mr
 harper but it-it is impossible please do
 not ever mention such a thing again
 harper had expected some such reply

 it fitted in with everything that she said
 and did  isnt there anything i can do
 to help you he queried gently

    yes-let me manage my own life in my
own way

 on their way back they called at the post
office and alice opened a bundle she had
just received from a printer in helena she
showed harper a new circular which stated
her business and appealed to the men to
write letters to their friends and relatives
and she remarked that she meant to have
them distributed along the whole line of con-
struction

   inadvertently she showed him something

 else she laid what appeared to be a per-
 sonal letter on top of her package and har-
 per noted without any intention of spying
 on her that the postmark read  willow-
 field ohio

   the name impressed him willowfield
 that might have been the name of his own
 native village with its huge willow trees
 weeping over the fields and meadows in
 which he had played as a boy

   probably that was where alice came
 from she had impressed him from the
 first as being a small town girl and now
 as he appraised her again he felt sure that
 she was small town girls do not start typ-
 ing offices in rough western railroad camps
 of course but on the other hand big city
 girls do not either

   at her office there was no business in
 sight so harper proposed that they should
 visit his she might be able to give him
 some hints on how to keep it in order he
 said she consented with a reluctance that
 vanished when she noted the  man want-
 ed  circulars that were pinned up in a long
 line on his wall

     what are those she queried

    alert for any sign that would throw light
 on the mystery of her appearance in geyser
 harper noted her sudden interest just as
 he had previously noted her interest in the
 graveyard

    just reward circulars he explained

  when a criminal escapes anywhere the
 police send them out broadcast

    she was looking at the pictures and read-
 ing the descriptions underneath-methodi-
 cally one by one just as she had read the
 inscriptions in the cemetery

    if one of these men shows up in gey-
 ser you will arrest him i presume

     i sure will

 and pocket the reward

  thats one of a sheriffs perquisites

  do you catch many of these wanted
 men

    im sorry to say that i dont

  but you keep a keen lookout for them
  each and every one

 harper thought that she was talking in a
 casual manner in order to conceal an interest
 that was considerably more than casual
g	argosy-allstory wtekly

  you seem interested in the notices he
remarked

   i am alice replied  i like to look
at a mans picture and guess at the crime
he committed then read the circular to see
if i am right you dont mind if i look at
all of them do you

    not in the least

  she finished her inspection with what
harper could have sworn was an indication
of relief the same sort of relief she had
shown after going through the graveyard

   do you receive new notices often she
queried

   every few days

   may i drop in again to look at any new
ones you may have

  harper was only to glad to have alice
drop in and said so he accompanied her
back to her office then returned to his own
and again set himself to the task of solving
the mystery of her appearance in geyser
he knew there was such a mystery quite as
well as he knew that alice was in danger
no woman was safe in geyser least of all
a pretty one who had antagonized the forces
of evil

  her interest in the grave boards and re-
ward notices was singular could it have
any bearing on her reason for being in this
town was he right in thinking she had
shown relief after scanning all the different
names he was almost sure that he was

  then there was the matter of her appeal
to the workers in general to remember their
friends and relatives back home her busi-
ness was certainly an odd one

   like a flash of inspiration a possible ex-
planation of all her odd actions came to
harper some relative or friend had dis-
appeared she suspected that he was work-
ing on the railroad and she wished to get in
touch with him

iv

  the more harper pondered his hypo-
thesis the more reasonable did it appear
alice figured that her name and mission
would spread to every camp on the far-
flung line of construction and in that way
the man she wished to reach would know
she was in the country her appeal to the
men in general to communicate with their

loved ones was really a plea to some one
man to communicate with her he won-
dered what relation this hypothetical man

would be to her probably a lover or her
husband since she had given him to un-
derstand when he proposed marriage that
her affection was already engaged harper
winced a little at the thought but there
was no getting away from it

  she had examined the grave board no-
tices to see if the name of the man she
sought was there and was relieved when it
wasnt she had scrutinized his reward no-
tices and had asked to see any future ones
he might receive for the same reason she
was seeking a man and was leaving no
stone unturned to find him this was the
only reasonable explanation of her presence
in geyser that harper could think of

  a few days later he went to the post
office as usual and returned with some let-
ters in his office he opened them one by
one the first contained a man wanted
circular he read it in his usual manner
and studied the picture of the wanted in-
dividual in an effort to recollect if he had
ever seen the person he had not so he
pinned it on his wall beside the others he
opened and read two other letters and
as he opened the last one he saw that it
too contained a man wanted notice

   he looked at the picture first and noted
that the wanted man one rodney allan
was rather a handsome fellow well dressed
evidendy an office worker of some sort
nothing unusual about that harper start-
ed to read the description and glancing
out of the window as he did so he noted
that alice juno was coming toward his
office he read hurriedly because he wanted
to get it pinned up before she arrived the
man was wanted for embezzlement com-
mitted in the town of-

  jim harper gasped as he read the name
willowfield ohio the place that alice
came from in a flash of understanding the
whole thing became clear to him this was
the man she sought-rodney allan who
was wanted for embezzlement no wonder
she wished to see every new one that was
received

  harpers big hand clenched and his usual
kindly expression was replaced by one that
the storm woman



 was not so good to look upon he glanced i - er - thought you might have got

 out of the window again alice was com- some new notices she quavered weakly
 ing along in her usual demure and innocent-  that-thats why i dropped in

looking manner	her right hand was on his desk within

 innocent demure he laughed harsh-	six inches of where the allan circular lay

 ly and cynically that was a woman for	back upward under the paperweight her

 you an angel on the surface with her	nervous fingers fidgeted closer and closer

 soul-stirring and tear-provoking appeals to	to it

 the men to write to their mothers while	 i just pinned up a new notice harper

 under the surface her real purpose was to	told her  down there on the end-see

 get in touch with a criminal so she could as-	she rose and looked at it

 sist him to escape the penalty of his crime	 that man doesnt look like a bad

 harper slammed the reward notice down	man she remarked as she returned to his

 on his desk a pretty fool he had made of	desk

 himself that was the woman he had fallen	 lots of criminals dont harper

 idiotically in love with whom he had asked	stated

 to marry him and the only use she had	 do you think that all these wanted

 for him was to learn if he was looking for	men are criminals she asked

 rodney allan so she could warn the latter	 why else would they be wanted
 to keep away from geyser	 you are very cynical to-day again
 her knock sounded on his door he	alice was seated at his desk her fingers
 turned the allan notice over on his desk	only a few inches from the overturned al-
 and placed a paperweight on it	ian notice harper wondered what would

the stretch of roadway that separated her
office from his then he turned to the allan
notice again

    innocent or guilty allan he said ad-
 dressing the picture on the circular  my
 job is to arrest you if you show up around
 here no matter how hard it will be on the
 little girl he reflected for a moment
 then put the notice in his inside pocket
  guess ill keep this out of her sight so
 shell not learn that i want you and warn
 you to keep away from here he added

v

  harper was glad that he had formed
the habit of keeping an eye on alice junos
office because now that his duty compelled
him to wratch for the appearance of rodney
allan he could do so without exciting sus-
picion her business was never very brisk
during the day and it was then that harper
attended to his other official duties

  with the coming of evening however
men from the camps thronged her place
and then harper made it his business to
scrutinize each and every one of them he
carried the pictures and descriptions of all
the wanted men in his mind but it was-
rodney allan that he particularly watched
for the chance that any of the others
were working on the railroad was small but
alice must have reason to believe that al-
lan wras in this district otherwise she wrould
not have located in geyser

   during most of the evening harper sat
on a chair in front of the lone star from
which he could obtain a pretty good view
of the typing office occasionally he
strolled past it and at other times he kept
a watch on the post office

  on every hand he heard complimentary
remarks regarding alices efficient service
at the post office joe blundell informed
him that his sale of money orders had dou-
bled

    fine for the relatives back home but
not so good for dan sherrard he re-
marked

   it wras at blundells store that harper
first caught sight of the man he wanted
rodney allan did not look very handsome
now his muddy clothes indicated that he

was employed at the lowest kind of man-
ual labor ugly lines had formed around
his mouth and in his eyes was the look

well known to harper of a fugitive from
justice despite his changed appearance
harper recognized him instantly

   he paid no apparent attention to the
man and since he did not wear his sher-
iffs star conspicuously allan paid no par-
ticular attention to him harper wanted
first of all to confirm beyond a doubt his
belief that alices mission in geyser was
to meet allan then he wished to see how
the man would treat the girl who had gone
to such pains to find him would he ap-
preciate her efforts also what was his
relation to her since their names were
different he was evidently neither her
brother nor her husband therefore he
must be her lover

   allan made an insignificant purchase and
 sauntered down the roadway in the direc-
 tion of the lone star he did not seem to
 notice the typing office opposite the dance
 hall and harper wondered if after all he
 was mistaken in thinking that allan was
 the man whom alice sought certainly he
 was the one described in the circular but
 that did not prove that alice was looking
 for him

  allan entered the lone star harper
followed and sat at a corner table where
he could watch the man without being seen

   he had felt chagrined at the possibility
 that his hypothesis regarding allan and
 alice was incorrect but now as he watched
 allan he hoped that it was the man was
 not in the lone star five minutes before
 harper was as well acquainted with his
 character as though he had known him for
 years

   allans first act was to order wrhisky
but there was nothing damning in that it
was the manner in which the fellow acted
toward one of the dance-hall women-the
one called babe who had wept when alice
begged the men to write to their mothers-
that revealed to sheriff jim harper what
kind of man he had to deal with

   allan called babe to his table and she
went readily enough her business there be-
ing to help the customers spend their
money he talked to her low and earnest-

                         	a
the storm woman



  y and there was nothing particularly
wrong about that either but when allan
grabbed babe and pulled her over to him
in a manner that was too coarse for even a
woman of her type to stand he revealed to
harper the sort of man he was

  the sheriff was minded to arrest him
then and there but he withheld his hand
despite the fact that allan had not gone
to the typing office harper still believed
that he was sought by alice he would
wait a while longer and see what would
happen

  it happened quickly enough when
kabe pulled away from him allan rose and
walked to the open front door and stood
there looking across the street harpers
table was close to this door he watched
the fellow closely

   allan looked across the street casually
suddenly he uttered an ejaculation and
stood staring as though he had seen a ghost

   who-whos that across there allan
asked this of a bystander harper heard
him quite clearly

    aint you heard of her replied the
other  where you been anyhow thats
the new girl that writes letters for every-
body and begs them to get in touch with
their people

   god in heaven allan muttered
harper knew only too well what allan
was thinking and for the first time in his
life he was sorry because he had reasoned
out something correctly

  in a moment allan crossed the street
harper let him go hardened man-hunter
as he was he did not quite have the heart
to apprehend the man that alice juno had
come here to find before she had a chance
to speak to him he stood in the doorway
of the lone star and watched allan enter
the typing office he would wait until the
man came out then step across and click
handcuffs on his wrists

   in her office alice was unusually busy
that evening a patron sat close beside
her desk dictating in a low tone that only
she could hear becaues of the clatter made
by her racing type-bars seated along the
wall like customers in a barber shop others
read or thought out their messages while
awaiting their turns being a touch typist

   	a

  as all experts are she did not need to keep

her eyes on her keys she glanced up as
each newcomer entered smiling if she knew

the person nodding and indicating the wait-
ing line if she did not

  suddenly she gasped and her flying fin-
gers faltered for the first time since her
arrival in geyser rodney allan stood in
the doorway he recognized her at the in-
stant that she recognized him and started
toward her an eager light in his eyes a
glad smile of recognition on his features

  but it was no part of alices plan that
the public and eventually the sheriff should
know that allan was any more to her than
any other railroad worker she shook her
head and frowned at him he stopped
short she indicated the line of chairs and
he grasped her message he took his place
there and she transferred her attention
back to her work

  she flushed with chagrin as she found
that in the ecstasy of allans arrival her
fingers had lost touch with her brain and
she had written meaningless words she
was compelled to stop her customer erase
the words and ask him to dictate his last
sentences over again but he did so with-
out realizing that anything unusual had
happened nobody in the room knew it
only a single person sheriff jim harper
had noticed the little drama and he was
outside looking through an open window

   it was an ordeal for alice to write letters
for all the men who were there before al-
lan entered she did not even have the
satisfaction of looking at him since the
line of chairs was behind her one by one
her customers dictated their letters and
went out until finally mians turn came to
sit close beside her others had entered
after him and were now awaiting their turn
in the same manner that he had

  alice had regained her composure and
except for a wonderful look that she flashed
at the man beside her her treatment of him
was apparently no different from her treat-
ment of others

  she asked whom he wished to write to
allan gave a name in the ordinary way
then her typewriter clattered even louder
than for the last man the noise that it
made was her only reason for operating it

they could exchange whispers without be-
ing overheard

  allan spoke first  why did you come
here he asked

  to find you of course i was worried
to death rodney

    youre not safe in a town like this

   im all right its you that are not
safe did the sheriff notice you

   whos he i dont know him ive
never been here before went to the job
through another town

   big man he wouldnt know you
though i looked over his notices of men
wanted and you werent among them but
youve got to be careful

    i will

   are you all right rodney you dont
look well

   im fine and you

   good enough ill never be really well
till youve cleared yourself

   ill do that

   youd better go now we cant keep
this up some one may learn that i know
you that h never do the sheriff sus-
pects im looking for a wanted man i
think if he learns that i know you he
may arrest you on suspicion

   all right see you again good-bv
   good-by

  her flying fingers stopped the noise of
her machine ceased she whirled what
looked like his letter out of the roller and
handed it to him

   sign on the bottom she stated aloud
 you may leave your letter here if you
wish and ill mail it one dollar please
he paid it  thanks and come again

    i will said allan

  he went out and alice continued her
work her eyes were bright now her bear-
ing buoyant her smile joyous for the
first time since coming to geyser she looked
happy she was blissfully ignorant of what
was happening outside

  allan had not proceeded more than
twenty yards from her office before harper
stepped suddenly out of a patch of dark-
ness and handcuffed him

   what-whats this for the prisoner
demanded

   you know harper answered

  allan swore

   who gave me away did any wom-
an he demanded

  harper winced as he had when allan
tried to embrace the dance-hall girl this
was the man that alice loved-one who
suspected immediately that she might have
betrayed him

   no he said without further words
harper took him to the jail and locked him
up

  that part of his job was easy enough
now came the hard part-the task of tell-
ing alice

  he went to her office at the mere sight
of him the happiness drained away from her
face the thought that his appearance af-
fected her like that was like an arrow in
his heart

   im sorry miss juno he said  but
im afraid ive got bad news for you

   what she cried and leaped up irom
her desk

   i have arrested rodney allan

  she stared at him horror-stricken
 what for

   for embezzlement committed in wil-
lowfield ohio why what is he to
you

  he is my husband alice exclaimed
and after giving this reply she burst into
harsh laughter

vl

  not a muscle of sheriff jim harpers
face moved as he heard this unwelcome an-
nouncement he was on duty now per-
sonal feelings were submerged

   i see he said  would you like to
visit mr allan in his cell

   yes said alice and in silence they
proceeded to the jail building

  harper let her in and she remained with
the prisoner for nearly an hour a hard
vengeful expression disfigured her fine fea-
tures when she came out

   i want to know a few things she said
 how did you know that mr allan is
wanted for embezlement in willowfield

   i received a circular stating that he
is

   when

   a few days ago
the storm woman



   let me see it

  harper took the notice from his pocket
  anti handed it to her

   i was here in your office only yester-
  day alice said  and i didnt see that no-
  tice where was it

   where you couldnt see it of course

   oh you kept it hidden from me

   naturally if you saw it you would
  warn allan that i was looking for him id
  have no chance to catch him then

   what made you think i would warn
  him

   because you too came from willow-
  field

   how do you know that

   i saw the postmark on a letter you re-
  ceived

  she flared up  then you are both a
  sneak and a liar 

  harper shruged his shoulders  abuse
  me if you wish officers of the law are
  used to that

   i mean it you tricked me by keeping
  that notice hidden while you led me to be-
  lieve you were letting me see all of them

   all right what of it i am a sheriff
  you know

   does a sheriff have to become a cheat
  and a liar

   a sheriff must enforce the law and he
  couldnt do that if he told everything he
  knew

   oh i despise you  alice cried  you
  -you said you were my friend and all
  the time you were only leading me into a
  trap to betray my husband

   i am still your friend

   then prove it let your prisoner go
  harper smiled grimly

   thats impossible

   it is possible but you wont do it

   hats it i wont

   oh god she collapsed into a chair
  and sobbed

  harper looked down at her and shook his
  head in silent pity such loyalty to a worth-
  less man he knew that allan was worth-
  less just as well as he knew that alice was
  one woman in ten thousand the mans
  attempted courtship of babe in the dance
  had had proved the former the pity
  of it a man whose advances had been re-

  jected by a dance hall hussy was loved by
  such a woman as this he sat down beside
  her

  mrs allan he said  i infer from
 what you said about innocent men being
 wanted the other day that you think your
 husband is innocent is that right

  i brow he is innocent she sobbed

  what makes you think that the wil-
 lowfield authorities would not send out cir-
 culars unless the evidence in their possession
 was pretty strong

  he says he is innocent that is
 enough

 harper shrugged his shoulders

  why did he run away

  because he could not prove his inno-
 cence

  are you quite positive that in addition
 to being innocent he is a loyal husband

  the best in the world

  has he never done anything that might
 lead you to believe he may not be true to
 you

 alice rose

  a while ago you spoke about doing your
 duty she said  does your duty include
 the making of base insinuations calculated
 to stir up strife between a husband and
 wife

 harper had been tempted to tell her
 about the dance hall incident but after
 all what business of his was it his duty
 was done alice and his prisoner were
 husband and wife he recollected the bib-
 lical injunction not to put asunder those
 whom god has joined together

  im sorry if my remark appeared to be
 an insinuation he said

 she rose to go

  thank you she said coldly

  would you like me to accompany you
 to your office harper queried  its dan-
 gerous for you to go about alone in geyser
 on a dark night

  no said alice and went out

 harper stood at his door and wtatched
 her as she disappeared in the night then
 he slumped down in his chair and sat there
 staring straight ahead of him

 outside stumbling along the dark patch
 of roadway alice quivered with suppressed


argosy-allstory weekly

 fury as she approached the radius of the
 lone star lights her interview with allan
 had aroused in her an intense desire to set
 him free by any means fair or foul

   the revelry in the dance hall was reach-
 ing its climax none of the sensible work-
 ers who sought only mild recreation re-
 mained no one that was even half sober
 was in the place now the tin-pannv piano
 whanged a fuddle screeched a trombone
 blared heavy feet scuffed the floor drunk-
 en laughter boomed the shrill cries of aban-
 doned women cut through the hideous din
 of the riotous night outside an occasional
 sinister figure slithered through the darkness
 like a prowling wolf

   but it was not of the danger that men-
 aced a lone woman on every hand that
 alice thought a new and terrible idea was
 sizzling in her brain

  those men in the lone star she had
 swayed the men of geyser once had moved
 them by the power of her voice and per-
 sonality to do what she wanted them to do
 could she repeat the performance

   obviously the lone star revelers were in
 the mood for mischief could she inspire
 them to real deviltry could she make
 them do a lawless thing could she per-
 suade them to raid jim harpers jail and
 liberate the man she loved

   she played with the thought as a child
 plays with fire the law had cheated and
 tricked her why should she not trick and
 cheat the law

   sle felt suddenly that she could do it
 that she could enter that sink hole of in-
 iquity and move the reckless men there to
 do her bidding a sense of power welled
 up within her why not use her power

   allan was guiltless of any wrongdoing
 and yet through the power of circumstan-
 tial evidence and the technique of the law
 that makes one partner liable for the wrong-
 doing of the other he would probably have
 to spend long years in prison but she
 could save him from it

  suddenly her mind was made up she
 hurried to the evil resort and entered it

   sherrard was at her side immediately
 his snaky eyes agleam his oily smile spread
 wide upon his degenerate features

    you  he cried  never was anybody

half so welcome you have reconsidered

 my offer you have come to me at last

    sherrard alice snapped  i want you
 to do me a favor i want to talk to these
 men will you let me

   sherrard made a sweeping bow

     my dearest girl he said  the place is
 yours

                     vii

    there was a little stage at the end of the
 dancing floor and it was toward this under
 sherrards leadership that alice made her
 way

    she paid no attention to the fact that in
 merely setting foot inside a resort of this
 nature a respectable woman endangered her
 reputation sights that at other times
 would have sent her scurrying out of any
 such place made no impression on her now
 she brushed against painted women that
 she had shrunk from on the street as though
 they were afflicted with leprosy and the
 contact affected her not at all blasphe-
 mous ejaculations and lewd phrases reached
 her ears but did not register on her mind
 leering looks went unnoticed sherrards
 significant phrase  my dearest girl car-
 ried no sinister meaning to her single-pur-
 posed mind

   she thought of only one thing she had
unwittingly delivered the man she loved into
the hands of the law and she proposed to
brew a storm of disorder and lawlessness
that would set him free the possibility
that she herself might be engulfed in such
a storm did not occur to her any more than
the thought of a holocaust occurs to a child
who strikes matches

   on the platform sherrard held up his
hand and demanded attention and in a
moment he secured it

    men he shouted with no more regard
for the women in hs employ than if they
were pins in his bowling alley this little
girl wants to talk to you and i want you to
listen you know who she is shes the
sweet-faced kid that mails your alimony
to your ex-wife when you dont want to do
it yourself you may have got the im-
pression that shes a stuck-up sister who
considers herself too good to play around
with rough guys like you and me but thats
the storm woman



   where youre mistaken shes a regular fel-
low 

   a drink-crazed reveler let loose a war
whoop and flung his hat at the ceiling

    hurrah for lil girl he shouted  go
to it kid were all ears like a jackass

   a wild outburst of shouts and cheers sec-
onded this sentiment the tumult added
fresh fuel to the flame of alices reckless
desire

    my friends- she began

   you bet were your friends

    it wasnt only to write letters for you
that i came to geyser principally it was
to find the man who means more to me than
anybody else in the world

    hurrah for the man 

    he was driven away from home men
by the same kind of misfortune that prob-
ably drove some of you away from your
friends and family he was unjustly ac-
cused of embezzling money he didnt-it
was his partner-but he was equally liable
so he ran away and came out here to try
to earn enough money to make good his
partners theft i dont know whether any
of you know rodney allan or not-

    i know him some one shouted

    so do i hes all right

   it did not occur to alice that encomiums
from men such as these were questionable
recommendations of character

    boys she went on  when i came to
geyser under my maiden name of juno
the first man i met was your sheriff jim
harper he acted like a pretty good fellow
he helped me get started in business he
swore he would protect me he said he
would do anything he could to further my
interests

   but he didnt men all he wanted
was to gain my confidence so he could learn
my real business he suspected that i
wanted to get in touch with some one who
was wanted by the police and he made up
his mind to learn who the man was and
grab the reward that would be offered for
his capture thats the kind of a friend
jim harper is

    he succeeded boys he was too smart
for me he knows all the tricks of the man-
catching trade and i dont one of his
schemes was to encourage me to look at the

man wanted circulars on file in his office

in the hope as i can see now that i would

betray myself if one of them described the
man i was looking for he hadnt received
a notice about mr allan then so he failed

in that scheme

   his next piece of trickery was to ex-
amine my personal letters he found out
that i came from willowfield ohio then
he received a circular saying that rodney
allan was wanted there and he put two
and two together and rightly guessed that
mr allan was the man i was trying to find

   then came his lowest trick of all har-
per pretended to show me all his new cir-
culars but he kept the allan one concealed
that prevented me from putting mr allan
on his guard mr allan learned that i was
here as i figured he would and this eve-
ning he came to see me harper was on the
lookout for him he recognized him from
his picture and description and locked him
up

  angry growls from her audience encour-
aged alice

   as if that wasnt enough men she
went on  this noble sheriff of yours insin-
uated that the man i came here to find is
not worth my efforts on his behalf is not
true to me no straight-out accusation
mind you just a mean insinuation that mr
allan is no good what do you think of an
effort like that to separate a husband and
wife because that is what we are my
friends rodney allan is my husband 
fierce cries rang out

   t hell with jim harper

   we seen him tryin to make love to
you

   youre the kind of a wife to have

  at the side of the hall the woman called
babe rose and began to push through the
crowd to alices platform sherrard saw
her and grabbed her roughly by the arm

   whats eatin you he demanded

    i want to tell that girl something babe
said  shes a good kid she got me writ-
in to my mother i want to tell her that
harper is right her man is a dirty dog
sherrard shook her  you open your
trap about that babe and ill hand you
a wallop understand he pushed her
away and she returned to her seat

  alice was playing upon the emotions of
her reckless audience now as a musician
plays upon a harp in passionate language
she appealed to them to cheat jim harper
of his prey to storm his flimsy jail and lib-
erate rodney allan they could easily do
it she said in the darkness harper would
not recognize them

   wrere they real men she asked or only
imitation men would they allow a help-
less woman to be bullied and cheated and
lied to by a brute of a sheriff would they
give their companion worker rodney allan
a chance to earn the money he was charged
with stealing and thus prevent his convic-
tion on technical evidence for a crime he
did not commit she ended up with the
greatest oratorical effort of her life and
quivering like a leaf awaited their verdict
it came quickly

    were with you kid

    lead us to him 

    youre dam right well get allan out

 t hell with the sheriff an the law
sherrard said nothing at all he stood
at one side eying alice as a cat eyes a
mouse within reach of its claws an evil
smirk upon his degenerate features

  a great hair giant of a man appointed
himself leader of the mob  follow me
boys he cried  lets go

   pell-mell the men tumbled out into the
street shouting and singing ribald songs
alice was at their head sherrard remained
behind in his establishment liquor and
excitement had not robbed him of his wits
he would play the foxs game his crazy
patrons could brave the danger he would
reap the reward

  toward the temporary jail in which
sheriff harper lodged his prisoners before
taking them to a stronger one the mob
made its disorderly way some had lighted
makeshift torches such as brooms and rags
tied to sticks after being soaked in kerosene
and the flickering tongues of fire from these
shot high into the darkness of the night
lighting up the marches in weird and terri-
fying fashion

viii

  the tumult of such an advance could
not fail to awaken any one w-ithin a quarter

 of a mile while they were still two hun-
 dred feet from the impromptu jail-a flimsy
 wooden structure hurriedly flung together
 at the first influx of the disorderly element
 -a light flared up inside showing that
 harper was out of bed and doubtless pre-
 paring for the coming encounter as the
 marchers approached his door flung open
 releasing a long shaft of light that fell upon
 the mob leaders and caused them to slow
 up a bit and jim harper stood there con-
 fronting them

   he was fully dressed except for his coat
 his pistol belt was about his waist show-
 ing two holsters with heavy pistol butts
 sticking out of them he stood there with
 a grim smile upon his firm features and
 eyed the approaching rabble with an ex-
 pression of contempt that suddenly changed
 to one of grave concern as he descried the
 girl he knew as alice juno at their head

   thats far enough  he shouted stay
 right where you are i can hear anything
 you say another step and somebody is
 liable to get hurt his fingers played with
 the butts of his guns

  the mob was not too reckless to heed
 his words those in front stopped dead in
 their tracks those behind continued to
 advance and for a little while succeeded
 in pushing the front line forward then
 harper whipped out two guns and the whole
 body halted as though their feet were caught
 by invisible traps but not before they had
 arrived within thirty or forty feet of him

   what do you want he demanded
 alice in front paid no more attention
 to his guns than if they had been firecrack-
 ers she walked right up to him

  we want rodney allan she pro-
 claimed

  harpers reply was calm

   you know thats imjwssible

   were going to get him alice cried
 you cant fight off thirty or forty men
youd better give him up

   what will you do if i dont

   storm your jail burn it down any-
thing

    some one will get hurt

    it  be you then with a spring that
look harper by surprise she flung herself
upon him and grasped him around the neck
the storm woman



    ive got him she cried to the men be-
hind her u come on 

   alices unexpected onslaught threw har-
per off his balance and sent him staggering
backward her slim arms tightening about
his neck were choking him he continued
to clutch his guns and for that reason could
not use his fingers to wrench her arms away
from his neck but he had no thought of
firing the weapons seeing his predicament
the mob surged into the office and piled up
on harper forcing him down on the floor
alice released him as the others grabbed
him and darted for a key that was hanging
on a nail

   as the sheriff and his assailants engaged
in a desperate conflict on the floor rolling
over and over upsetting chairs and tables
one of his guns was kicked out of his hands
and clattered across the floor alice
grabbed it

   he retained the other and could undoubt-
edly have used it to deadly effect had he
chosen but even in the extremity of his
struggle against overwhelming odds his first
thought was for alice he could not see
whom he was fighting for all he knew
she was one of the many who were over-
powering him and on that account he re-
frained from firing he even withdrew
his finger from the trigger lest the weapon
should go off accidentally he managed
to get his right hand which held it under-
neath his body and on his knees like a
wrestler with half a dozen men on top of
him he ceased struggling for a moment in
preparation for another effort to throw off
his assailants

   meanwhile alice with the key rushed to
the cell door the prisoner of course was
awake with the first appearance of the
mob allan had crumpled in his cell as
dreadful thoughts of lynchers came to his
mind then as he saw alice through the
bars he realized that the mob meant to
free not lynch him and he stood palpitating
at the cell door and yelling encouragement
to alice and her followers

  she unlocked the door and thrust the
pistol she had picked up into her husbands
hand  run she cried  get into the
bush outside the town and then make for
the mountains

  allan grabbed the gun and made for the

door

   still on his knees with his assailants on

top of him harper caught a glimpse of the
prisoner escaping and the sight nerved him
to a supreme effort since his pistol hand

was free he was able to jam the gun into
his holster that enabled him to use his
right hand with a prodigious effort he
heaved to his feet and struck out with both
hands working toward the door as he did so

  only one thought was in his mind now
to recapture the prisoner whom he had seen
escaping he fought his way out flung
off his last enemy and seeing allan dash-
ing for the near-by trees that fringed a
creek he made after him at top speed

  meanwhile an unexpected development
had been taking place outside the jail
many of the mob had been unable to get
inside harpers office and others probably
retained sense enough to keep out and these
had set fire to the building doubtless with
the idea of freeing the prisoner by that most
desperate of all methods should their other
efforts fail the fact that they might in-
cinerate allan in the process had evidently
not occurred to them

  with harper gone the men inside the
structure came tumbling out alice along
with them and so surprised and delighted
were they by the blood-tingling sight of a
building aflame that they were diverted
from their purpose of pursuing the sheriff

  the blaze was rapidly gaining headway
red ribbons of flame were darting higher
and higher licking at the black sky like
the fiery tongues of monsters from the in-
ferno lighting up the faces of men whose
passions were as uncontrolled as the flames
the fire crackled spat and cannonaded
as it gnawed at the dry board structure

  its fury seemed to add to the triumphant
frenzy of the men who had been intoxicated
with liquor to begin with they were be-
side themselves now all thought of the
escaped prisoner seemed to vanish they
had accomplished what they set out to do
and now they would celebrate their triumph
their wild shouts like those of indians on
the war path rang out above the fierce ac-
companiment of the roaring flames they
danced and flung hats into the air

   but alice did not join their revels a
sudden revulsion of feeling swept over her as
she saw jim harpers personal and treasured
belongings menaced by the fiery destroyer
after all harper had done various deeds of
kindness for her he was only doing his duty
now

   alone she dashed into the office before
the flames which had been kindled at the
back of the structure reached it she
grabbed one end of his cot and dragged it
outside

   help me she cried to her followers
 weve got to save his stuff

    t hell with his stuff shouted some
one in reply  let er bum

   she was going back into the place alone
for more of harpers belongings when a
heavy hand grasped her shoulder and the
big man who had acted as mob leader
grinned at her

    never mind that girly he said
 were all goin back to the lone star to
licker up and celebrate right before she
could protest he picked her up as though she
were a doll and swung her to a sitting pos-
ture on his massive shoulder

    come on boys he cried  back to
the joint lets make a night of it

   alice was helpless her captor called
for cheers for her and these were given
with ear-splitting vigor the gang started
singing  we wont go home till morn-
ing and set off for the saloon leaving the
fire to bum itself out

ix

   to alice perched on the shoulder of a
man who was intoxicated with both liquor
and excitement the triumphant parade
back to the lone star was not the hilarious
event that it was to the others

   she wanted to escape from this crazy
mob but her chance to do so seemed slim
she had no desire to participate in a bar-
room celebration with drunken men and
abandoned women now that her husband
had been set free she felt a reaction against
the lawless disorder of the night

   but having brewed the storm she real-
ized that it would be no easy matter to
escape from the effects of it

   at the dance hall the man who carried

her on his shoulders seemed to sense her
desire to quit the riotous assemblage and
he made it his business to guard her as
though she were a prisoner

    up to the bar everybody he called
out and pushed alice there along with the
others  what hi you have sister he
asked her

     nothing said alice  i dont drink-

   bunk he cried you cant come
that on this bunch wine for the lady
he shouted and the bartender set a glass
of the sparkling beverage on the counter
in front of her

   everybody was looking at her seemingly
 in wonder that she was not as enthusiastic
 in celebrating their victory over law and
 order as she had been in battling for that
 victory she did not wish to antagonize
 them she felt that she owed them a great
 deal indeed so by way of showing her ap-
 preciation of their efforts on her behalf she
 swallowed the wine

    want to set em up for the crowd
the bartender asked her

   sure she does bellowed her giant
companion

   she paid for the round-a large amount
since the lone star was packed now with
all-night revelers from other resorts who
had heard about the jail delivery it
seemed a sinful waste of money to spend
so much for liquor she would have pre-
ferred to reward the men in some other
way but since they were not backward
about informing her that this was the re-
ward they preferred she  set em up  a
second time and then a third

   then the dancing started

   alice had no desire to dance but she
quickly found that she was virtually com-
pelled to do so on all sides she was sur-
rounded by her celebrating companions
the first grabbed her as though she were
one of the painted women and she pulled
away from him only to pitch into the amis
of another member of the gang this one
treated her in a less rowdy manner and she
circled the floor with him after which he
passed her along to a hilarious companion
who danced with her for a while and in
turn passed her to another man
the storm woman-



  she felt cheap and sordid and low but
there did not seem to be anything she could
do about it she flashed a silent appeal at
dan sherrard who watched her from the
little platform at the end of the dancing
space he grinned at her in a peculiar
manner but did not come to her aid

  men and women were dancing now with
glasses of liquor in their hands they
thrust these glasses into alices face and in-
sisted that she should drink she refused-
she was determined not to drink another
drop no matter what happened-and this
enraged one man to such an extent that he
threw his glass of liquor into her face a
fight threatened then but the man was
dragged away and the  fun  proceeded
the woman called babe wiped alices face
and said  you gotta get used to rough
guys like that deary

  suddenly the big fellow who had born
her to the dance hall on his shoulder el-
bowed his way through the mob that sur-
rounded her and before she knew what he
was about seized her as before and boosted
her up on top of a table

    les see y dance kid he said
enraged and alarmed now alice looked
down at the crowd that surged around her
laughing and shouting cheering her and
commanding her to dance

  i wont she cried you have no
right to ask me to make a show of my-
self

   huh whas matter kid the big
fellow was leering up into her face  aint
we all havin good time togezzer aint
gettin shamed o your little playmates are
yuh

  looking all around her alice saw that
the drunken grins of the men were slowly
giving way to more alarming expressions

   i want to get out of here  she ex-
claimed and tried to jump to the floor

  hands clutched her ankles and held her
to the table top

   what t hells the matter with you
snarled the big fellow  aint wre good
enough for you we were all right a little
while ago when you wanted us to set that
damned good-for-nothin husband of yours
free we did it didnt we an now we
can go t hell we can heh

   are you insane do you know what

youre saying she cried

  the big fellows laughter rang through
the hall an ominous silence had fallen on
the lawless assemblage scowls were on
every face

   think we swallowed that guff o yours
about allan bein an innocent guy the
hell we did think we dont know him
ill say we do right this evenin he wras
here lappin up booze and tryin to get
fresh with the girls-

    you lie 

   how about it boys the big fellow
appealed to his companions  aint that
guy that we got out o jail the same one
that was gettin fresh with babe

   he sure was

   helluva nerve shes got pullin that
sunday-go-to-meetin stuff on us

  his wife maybe

  these and similar expressions came from
every side

   you are liars all of you alice
looked down into the sea of brutal leering
faces  let me out of here she cried

   not till were through with you kid
answered the big fellow  not till you
show a lil appreciation of what we done for
you we risked a heap o trouble to get
your man out an now by jupiter youre
goin to give us a little fun

  alice glimpsed sherrard elbowing
through the crowd to her table he reached
her side and whispered

   youre in a bad jam girlie i can
get you out but you got to be nice to me
afterward see ive been struck on you
from the minute i saw you-

  with all her strength alice slapped sher-
rards face

   all right damn you the wolves can
have you im through the proprietor
moved away cursing and swearing

  babe saw him coming in her direction
and moved hastily off she was afraid of
sherrard she went out to the veranda and
stood there looking in at alice and from
her to the distant lights of the nearest rail-
road camp

  around the table on which alice still
stood the crowd of brutes jammed closer
and closer she looked down into their evil


argosy-allstory weekly

 faces she recollected that these men were
 the lowest dregs of all the camp on the
 line the stench of their liquor-laden
 breath was in her nostrils

    there was no drunken joviality in their
 expression now because she refused to
 participate in their revel in the same way
 that the abandoned women of the place
 did they seemed to think that she had
 duped and cheated them their drink-in-
 flamed eyes on a level with her ankles
 looked scarcely human in all that crowd
 now that babe was gone there was not one
 friendly face the female habitues de-
 lighted with the opportunity for revenge
 upon a woman who had spurned them in
 the past were as merciless as the men

    in a flash of understanding alice real-
 ized now what a dreadful mistake she had
 made when she inflamed these bestial men
 to lawless conduct deliberately with the
 power of her eloquence she had brewed a
 storm she had persuaded them to outrage
 the law- that was her sole protection against
 their evil nature without the law she
 could not have existed in geyser she had
 temporarily abolished that law without tak-
 ing into account that in so doing she had
 swept away the bulwark that protected her
 now she stood alone unprotected power-
 less to save herself from the abyss of an-
 archy that she herself had uncovered

   shake it up kid if you think you
 can get us to do your dirty work and then
 tell us to go to hell you got another guess
 cornin show us the hootchy-kootchy 

    a closed fist jabbed at her ankles and
 she kicked the owner of it full in the face
 his snarl of rage was echoed by the others
 many hands reached up at her

   then the miracle happened her agon-
 ized eyes caught sight of a figure that
 lurched through the open door-a man with
 blood on his face and clothing torn but
 with a glint of determination in his eyes
 that brought an involuntary prayer
 thanksgiving to her lips the man
 sheriff jim harper

  x

when harper caught sight of his p
oner allan dashing out into the night

one and only thought was to recapture him
in the darkness he could see the fellows

vague outline flitting toward the cotton-
woods by the creek and he made after him
on the run his pace was none too fast
because of the high-heeled riding boots he
wore presently allan gained the shelter
of the trees and disappeared among them

   the pistol that harper had placed in his
holster was still there and as he ran be
drew it for a shot at the fleeing figure in
front then a thought came to him and
he withheld his fire thus allowing allan to
reach the cottonwoods the fugitive was
the man that alice loved he must not in-
jure him if it was possible to capture him
otherwise

   harper did not know that allan possessed
his other gun the one that had been kicked
out of his hand and which alice had hand-
ed to the prisoner he was soon to find
out however a sharp report rang out m
front a stab of fire cut the darkness and
the zip of a bullet warned harper that lie
had narrowly escaped being hit he
jumped behind a tree and returned the
shot

   he knew now that it was his missing
weapon that mian possessed its report
was familiar five of its six chambers had
been loaded the one underneath the ham-
mer being empty as always and of these
cartridges one had been fired there re-
mained four shots at allans command

   harper on the other hand still had his
belt around his waist and thus possessed
abundant ammunition

   the sheriff paused for a moment behind
his tree then edged forward to the shelter
of another mians gun barked again and
again missed and harper heard the mans
footsteps splashing in the creek and clam-
bering up the high rim-rock beyond it he
hurried to the creek and crossed it as noise-
lessly as possible but not without drawing
another shot that left two in allans gun
also the fugitive disclosed his position
halfway upthe cliff

pistol in hand harper ran to a pathway
near by and made his way as fast as pos-
sible upward to the high benchland that
is- lay on that side of the town from the
lis occasional sounds that allan made he knew
the storm woman



   that the fugitive unaware of the paths ex-
   istence was also making his way upward
   with less speed and more difficulty

  at the top harper lay prone on the
ground for two reasons he was winded
and in the moonlight that now lighted up
the scene to some extent he would be able
to sight allan when the latter reached the
top

   in a moment the fugitive appeared over
 the rim harper rose and ran forward

   allan hearing the footsteps of his pur-
 suer ran also-not away from the rim along
 the level land but along the edge of it as
 though in search of a draw or coulee into
 which he could escape

   to halt his quarry harper fired a shot
 into the air allan turned then and fired
 twice in quick succession harper felt a
 stinging sensation in his shoulder but he
 did not halt allan had no more cartridges
 the pursuit would soon be over he yelled
 to the fugitive to stop but the latter paid
 no attention

   harper fired again-not at the man be-
 cause he was alices husband but in the
 air in an effort to frighten him into sur-
 render it only caused allan to dash to
 the edge of the rim-rock he stood there
 for a second and harper figured that he
 had him he approached to within a few
 feet he knew that beyond allan there
 was a sheer drop of many feet to jagged
 rocks below

   allan however did not seem to know
that apparently he thought that the rim-
rock at this point was formed in the same
manner as at the point where he clambered
up he put his hand on the ground and
jumped over evidently expecting to land
on his feet two or three feet below

   his feet struck nothing he tried to re-
 cover himself with the hand he had placed
 on the rim in the moonlight that now
 lighted up the scene to some extent harper
 glimpsed a frightful look on the mans face
 as he grasped at the edge of the rock for a
 hold he tried to grab allans hand to
 pull him up but he was too late the
 mans fingers slipped over the edge a hor-
 rible thud sounded from below

   as fast as he could harper made his way
 downward to where allan lay he was un-

  conscious but his heart was beating har-
per hoisted him to his shoulder and stag-
gered down the slope the sky-licking
flames from his burning jail helped to light
his pathway the pain in his own shoulder
was increasing and his strength was begin-
ning to ebb but still he staggered along
carrying the unconscious husband of the
woman he loved

  in the meantime the dance-hall girl
known as babe was also engaged in a des-
perate effort when she ran out of the
lone star and looked back at alice she
tried to think of some way to help the girl
who had befriended her seeing the lights
of a railroad camp in the distance she de-
cided to go there and summon help she
ran at first but speedily found that she did
not possess the stamina for such strenuous
exercise sobbing and gasping for breath
she stumbled on through the darkness

  only too well she realized the danger
that threatened the girl who had inspired
her to write to her mother for the first time
in years in her queer way she loved
alice the typist had been so sympathetic
had not laughed at the palpable lies she dic-
tated to her mother had even suggested
additional ones anything to make her
mother happy she said and babes
mother had replied babe had sent money
home then had reestablished family ties
had felt almost respectable again when her
mother invited her to spend a month or
two at the old home

  that was an impossible proposition of
course only too well babe knew that she
would unwittingly betray her real character
ten minutes after she struck the old town
but letters from her mother arrived regu-
larly now they were the only bright spots
in an existence that she loathed but could
not escape from and never would she for-
get the girl who had made them possible

  after what seemed hours of labored ef-
fort babe glimpsed a light in the bunk-
house and toward it she directed her wab-
bling footsteps the door was unlocked
and she plunged in all the occupants were
in bed and apparently asleep the oil
lamp was turned low for some late-comer
probably

  babe spied a tin wash basin she seized


argosy-allstory weekly

it and pounded upon it with the dipper
immediately men sat up sleepy-eyed and
profane demanding to know the cause of
the disturbance

  the girl that writes letters babe
gasped  theyve got her in the lone
star and they wont let her out theyre
makin her drink makin her dance for
the love o gawd get her out men get
her out

  a man jumped out of his bunk and dived
into his clothes with no more regard for
babes presence than if she were a wooden
post

  come on boys he cried well
show that joint wrhats what well clean
em out are you with me

  every man in the bunkhouse was they
flung into necessary garments shot out the
door and set off for town on the run babe
trailed along far behind

xi

   alices joy when she beheld her husband
that evening for the first time in many
months had been great but not so great as
was her joy now at the sight of jim harper
in the doorway of the lone star

  two seconds before he appeared she was
in the worst panic of her life fear had
almost paralyzed her vicious eyes were
gleaming up at her from all sides hands
were reaching up and grasping at her an-
kles and skirts in another moment she
would have been pulled down from the
table to a fate that she dared not guess at

  but now jim harper had arrived in-
stantly her peril seemed to dissipate true
he was badly done up but what of that
the sight of his broad shoulders his de-
termined features his glinting eyes was
like the sight of water to a traveler crazed
with thirst for the first time she realized
that during all the days she had been in
geyser he was a prop upon which she had
unwittingly leaned he was the law the
same law that she had just now mocked
and derided and rebelled against what a
fool she had been to unleash the storm that
had temporarily routed the law at its
very worst it was still immeasurably pref-
erable to the anarchy that followed it

  but the damage was done the storm was
unleashed and the mere fact that she
wished order restored did not necessarily
mean that it would be restored with a
fresh chill of apprehension she realized
that harper was only one man against fifty
or sixty-an exhausted man at that

   at first sight of the sheriff the mob that
surrounded her had momentarily ceased its
tumult but now as the men realized the
sheriffs spent condition and recollected that
they had as they thought run him out of
town the spirit of disorder inspired them
afresh and they let loose a pandemonium
of yells and cries of what they would do to
him if he tried to interfere

  harper regarded them for a moment in
silence his strength was going fast but
this was the supreme moment of his life
the woman he loved was in peril-deadly
peril in their present drunken and in-
flamed state the brutes w ho surrounded her
would stop at nothing he drew his pistol
and summoned every ounce of his remain-
ing strength this the biggest effort of his
life must not fail

  he held his pistol by his side and ad-
vanced to within three or four feet of the
edge of the crowd every eye was upon
him

   a passage he demanded  open it
or ill shoot it open

  his gun pointed toward the table the
man immediately in front of it edged to
one side then the next did likewise this
left a third man directly in front of the
pistol evidently he meant to stand his
ground but harpers glinting eyes were
upon him and so was the sinister black
muzzle of the gun so he too edged out of
the line of fire in thirty seconds there w as
a clear pathway between alices table and
the sheriff she leaped dowrn dashed along
it and stood panting beside her rescuer

  together they backed toward the door
the mob inching forward as the two retreat-
ed but held at bay despite its overwhelm-
ing numbers by the gleam in harpers eye
and the threat of the pistol in his hand

   yells sounded outside and alice wheeled
in alarm to face this fresh menace

  then she saw it was no menace it was
the men that babe had aroused at the grad-
the storm woman



ing camp they gathered around her and
harper until they grasped the situation
then flung themselves upon the mob that
kept inching forward as steadily as harper
kept retreating

    the scene that followed was probably
 the wildest that had ever occurred in that
 theater of many disorderly affairs fists
 swung on every side curses mingled with
 groans tables crashed to the floor women
 screamed pandemonium reigned one of
 the big hanging oil lamps was struck by a
 chair swung high overhead by some frantic
 battler and fell blazing to the floor a
 fire started in some tawdry draperies and
 everybody made for the doors

    all at once alice realized that she was
 safe and that harper was by her side his
 arm was around her shoulder somehow
 it gave her a delicious feeling of security
 her battle was at an end she wanted to
 rest she wondered where her husband
 was she wanted to ask but she could not
 a feeling of drowsiness was overpowering
 her she fainted

    the fighting ceased as the blaze inside
 grew there was no attempt to save the
 lone star by the men who had just arrived
 from the camp in fact they yelled their
 approval of its destruction just as the mob
 had previously cheered the burning of the
 jail harper shouted orders to them to get
 pails from blundells store and form a
 bucket brigade to wet down the buildings
 adjacent to the dance hall and thus keep
 the fire from spreading they began to
 carry out his orders and then he carried
 alice across to her door which he burst
 open since he did not have the key and
 laid her on her couch

  babe came stumbling in at that moment
breathing like a broken bellows

   is-is she hurt she gasped

   no said harper  just fainted all
right in a minute stay here with her till
i come back will you

  babe was very willing to do this and
harper left the office he saw that the
fire was being brought under control and
he proceeded shakily to the residence of the
railroad doctor stationed in the village
where he had the slight but painful bullet
wound in his shoulder dressed

   in her office alice awoke to find babe

 seated beside her couch

    where is mr harper she asked

    hell be back in a little wrhile babe
 told her

    my husband-do you know anything
about him

    not a thing dearie - except that if
 harper is back your husband is back too
  who brought the men from the camp
 here babe

    i did said the dance-hall woman
 proudly tears softened her hard eyes
  you-you got me writing to my mother
 dearie she said  i-id do anything for
 you

   alice looked at her

    you are too good for the kind of life
 you are leading babe she said

   the woman cried softly too late
now she said  i cant get away from it
the best i can do is keep sending money
to mother and think up new lies about how
well im doing in a department store
alice looked at the woman again a
great question was in her mind now those
assertions of the men in the lone star that
her husband was a rotter-could they have
a basis of truth why had harper asked
her if she was quite sure her husband was
true to her she recollected various little
acts of rodney allan that in the light of
this new and terrible possibility seemed a
bit suspicious

    babe she said  you wouldnt lie to
 me like those men in the saloon would
 you

   babe seized her hand

    so help me god i wont

    then tell me babe-you know what
 goes on in the lone star-is my husband
 mr allan anything-anything like those
 men said he was

   babe burst out sobbing

    is he alice clutched the womans
 arm

   babe nodded

   alice sank back on her couch and for a
 moment lay there in silent misery then
 she whispered  tell me-all about it-
 please

   babe braced up  only this evening he
 wanted me to beat it to mexico with him


argosy-allstory weekly

said he still had the swag he got away with
in willowfield hes been after me like
that for a long time i wouldnt go and
he got rough and i slapped his face

  for a poignant moment the two women
looked at each other then their hands
met and they held to each other like drown-
ing persons it was alice who spoke first

   babe dear she said  there was a
time not long ago when i couldnt under-
stand why some women fall to the very bot-
tom but now i do understand

  the door opened presently and sheriff
jim harper entered

   jim said alice in a tone that was as
hard and cold as babe s used to be u where
is my husband

  the big sheriff did not answer immedi-
ately he looked at her with sorrowful
eyes as though dreading to speak

   where cried alice

  harper sat down beside her couch

    please try to be brave alice he said
 it isnt good news that i have for you

the

   is he- alice was staring at him hor-
ror in her eyes

  harper nodded  he is dead yes he
fell over the rim-rock in trying to escape

he was alive when i picked him up but
when i got him into the village he wasnt
for a time silence reigned then harper
spoke again slowly and softly

   if theres anything i can do alice-
there was no reply for a moment her
head was turned away but presently she
spoke

   there is something jim she said at
last  i want you to go away now leave
me alone with babe she understands me
and i understand her but you may come
back jim and if you wish to you may
try to restore my faith in mankind per-
haps youll succeed perhaps not-but i
hope you can jim

  harper pressed her hand

    i can dear he said

  then he went out a great new happi-
ness was in his heart

 let the dance co on

upstairs meanwhile silvers was
pacing the floor he had locked
himself into the french drawing-

thrown a white cloth from time to time

this story began in the argosy

 he glanced at it from under knitted brows
 as he waited

 at garrys knock he admitted him
 promptly

  i suppose the next thing is to look for
 clews he said without wasting any time
  i thought wed better do that together-
 in case of trouble with the police later on

    i dare say agreed garry

   they drew back the white cloth and bent
 over da costa without disturbing any-
 thing

    there was evidently a struggle said
 garry at once  his clothes have been
 mussed up a good deal-thats plain he
 resisted his assailant-or began the fight
 himself

    looks like it 

    that seems to preclude the possibility
 of its having been a woman added garry
 then

    maybe silvers was noncommittal
  i have known women to put up a pretty
 good struggle-at times 

   garry made no answer to this he was
 examining da costas clothes

    no pockets in the trousers they fit bet-
 ter without he observed  a wallet in
 his coat-some silver-three keys-hand-
 kerchiefs thats all

    the keys might tell us something if
 we can find out anything about them
 said silvers  anything in the wallet

    money said garry investigating
  cards-thats all 

   they looked at each other

    well

    well

    i suppose if one knew about finger-
 prints the knife might tell us something-
 mused garry  but my education stops
 short there he covered the body with
 the cloth again and stood up  wed bet-
 ter see what the maid and the check-room
 boy have to say

   silvers went to the door and called the
 woman by name and she appeared prompt-
 ly it was clear that she had been antici-
 pating the summons and was reveling in
 the sudden importance the tragedy had
 conferred upon her she was only too
 eager to be questioned

    ada said silvers  you know what
 has gone on in here to-night

    yes sir said ada

    what do you know about it

   well sir-not much said ada

  though i came running in w-hen the gen-
 tleman there did-and saw him-da costa

i mean lying there dead it was the
scream brought me like it brought him-

only he must have been nearer because he

was here first

 you heard no unusual sounds from this

room before the scream asked garry

   well no sir im not saving there
were no sounds but with lending a hand
here-and taking a stitch there-as the
ladies come up for repairs and the like-
why-i wasnt paying much attention to
anything outside my own room and then
the noise downstairs and the band and all
i never heard a sound till i heard the
scream but that was so shrill and so kind
of hurt and awful-it just went through me
-and brought me out almost in spite of
myself you might say

   did you hear or see da costa when he
came up asked silvers

   no sir i heard nothing but the
scream until he went through the room
searching like as if he was expecting to find
the young lady and called  katherine
katherine twice like that-and then i
heard a kind of dull thud in the turkish
room and in he came carrying her-and
her as white as the cloth there-and in a
faint looking as if she was dead herself
 miss kendall was in the turkish
room asked silvers

   yes sir-if that was her name she
was in there hiding most like for he had
to call twice before he saw her

   and nobody else was here

   only mark from the mens room he
came when i did

    well said silvers slowly  if that is
all you can tell us go back to your post
and send in mark but remember-not a
word of this to any one

   no sir she answered nodding and
passed out

   this is bound to be awkward for miss
kendall if it has to go to the police said
silvers as the door closed behind her

  unpleasant-thats all but beastly
unpleasant i can testify that she was here
only a second before she screamed she
had just left me you see and i was wait-
ing on the stairs for her

   but your testimony- said silvers
with a shake of his head  you love her
youd lie for her

 if need be admitted garry simply

                                 a
the dance of death



   but it will not be necessary well find
  the murderer

      i hope so  said silvers

   at that moment mark knocked and
 they admitted him

     now mark said silvers  w-e know
  that you came in here when miss kendall
  screamed-and saw what immediately fol-
  lowed what we want to know is if you
  saw anything or heard anything before
  miss kendall screamed-anything i mean
  chat might throw a little more light on the
  case 

     well sir said the boy slowly  i saw
  mr da costa come up

     when was that asked garry eagerly

     about five minutes before i heard miss
  kendall scream

     only five minutes before repeated
  silvers

     it couldnt have been much longer
  said mark  it was just after he finished
  his dance i happened to be standing at
  the door of the mens room listening to the
  music he came up looking kind of white
  and met a lady on the stairs and stopped
  to talk to her she was going down just as
  he w-as coming up and they stopped to
  talk it looked like he didnt much want
  to talk to her but she kind of hung on to
  him by the lapel of his coat i didnt hear
  what she said da costa looked up at me
  and frowned and i went in

   so you didnt see whether the lady
  went downstairs again or came up here with
  da costa asked garry quickly

   no sir-i didnt

   you didnt come to the door again

  no sir not until i heard the
scream 

   did vou recognize the ladv

   no sir 

   but you can describe her surely you
can tell us what she looked like  cried
silvers

   well sir she had-she had a kind of a
nice face-big eyes-and-a very low-cut
dress- and hair cut short

   what color was her hair what color
was her dress asked garry impatiently

  the boy hesitated in some embarrass-
ment then he looked up to meet their
anxious eyes

   	a

   i dont know he said  yeu see-

  im color-blind

chapter vii

dead lips tell no tale

silvers and garry looked at each

other in some exasperation then
garrv said patiently

   still-you would know her again if you
saw her-wouldnt you

   yes-i guess so mark admitted slow-
ly it was plain that he was far from cer-
tain apparently he was not as observant
as he might have been in respect to femi-
nine charms-or else the particular lady in
question had not entirely appealed to him

   well suppose you try suggested sil-
vers  go down to the supper room and
have a look about if you see the lady
there dancing or sitting at one of the
tables let us know

   ill go with him said garry  if
youll wait here

   silvers hesitated

   you see explained garry calmly
 this boy may be implicated in this affair
in fact it is just possible that lie killed da
costa himself-and that he invented the
storv of the ladv on the stairs to mislead
us

  at this the boy turned white his jaw
dropping his eyes almost popping out

   my god mr silvers you dont believe
that he gasped

   no silvers assured him  but it is
a possibility as mr carpenter points out
-so you had better try hard to locate that
woman 

    will exclaimed mark and he start-
ed off with garry leading the way with a
most determined air

  when they reached the supper room
however the lights were down again and
two negro boys were dancing they were
from the colored show that had that season
taken the town by storm and they had
been engaged as a sort of special attraction
to do their sensational turn here the cal-
cium lights that had been trained upon da
costa and his partner a little while before
were now trained on them as they shuffled


argosy-allstory weekly

and shook and stepped about with amazing
celerity and verve

  garry and the check-room boy waited
until the dance ended and the negroes came
back for their encore this time they sang
instead of dancing and garry beckoned
mark to follow him to the balcony where
the man who managed the calcium lights
was stationed

  there in silverss name he confiscated
one of the lamps and while the electrician
kept the negroes covered with one white
spotlight he switched the other upon the
tables turning it this way and that so that
mark could see every one within its scope
the guests thought it was part of the pro-
gram and laughed and shielded their eyes
or tried to sit motionless and proudly un-
heeding as the light struck them and the
negro performers were too old at their game
to so much as look surprised accordingly
mark was able to study the various groups
unobserved and his survey was soon re-
warded

   thats the woman-there-with the
fan and the band of diamonds on her head
he cried excitedly pointing following
with his glance the direction of marks
outstretched finger garry saw joan olcott
leaning forward wtith a fixed expectant
almost fascinated glitter in her eyes she
was intent upon the maneuvers of the ne-
groes something in her responding to the
wild savagery in their every move and tone
he thought of salome there was some-
thing about her that reminded him of the
evil passionate abandoned creature who
had become enamored of the baptist-and
danced for his head

  she was very pale-almost ghastly white
with lips that were too full and too crim-
son her mouth was cruel her eyes were
too large and too intense her black hair
cut short was so thick that it stood out
crisply about her head held in place from
the crown to the forehead by a circlet of
diamonds she wore a gown of orange-col-
ored chiffon and had rubies in her ears

  too vivid-too brilliant-she looked as
she leaned there across her table with gaze
fixed upon the gyrating negroes her nos-
trils quivered as she breathed

   come let us go said garry

  they returned to the supper room and
from the doorway garry sent charlie to
summon the woman

   tell her a gentleman wants to speak
to her about guy da costa he said

  charlie nodded

   any new developments yet he asked

   not yet answered garry regretfully

  charlie started on his way through the
tables garry dismissed mark and waited 
the other man who was waiting-bartlett
-cowering behind his palms in the far cor-
ner of the room studied garry thoughtful-
ly he had been observing the crowd
closely-unceasingly-since his return to
his table and he had wondered about gar-
rys exits and entrances

  had the police been notified had they
arrived did they find any clews

  these questions tortured him he would
have liked to ask them but this was mani-
festly impossible he was not supposed to
know wrhat had happened in that little
french drawing-room upstairs he must
not even suspect there was anything wrong
nobody else in those crowded rooms seemed
to suspect he must be as gay and careless
and frivolous as they

  but it was hard to do that-with the
wound in his side still bleeding

  he had tried various postures to strive
to close the wound but it was a vertical
gash which his sitting position kept open
if he could only lie down for a bit so that
the edges would come together and permit
the blood to congeal but he could not lie
down he had to sit there-drinking his
champagne-smoking his cigar-smiling-
and watching listening waiting for the ap-
proaching footsteps of the police

  he had already placed a second napkin
over the first against thj wound the first
was saturated but the blood stain did not
yet show above his waistcoat although
the stain had spread it had spread all the
more slowly for his cleverness in placing
the napkins there

  a waiter - his waiter - came by eying
him he summoned a smile and ordered
more champagne

  from the colemans table katherine
too watched garry with anxious hopeful
the dance of death



 eyes deep within her somewhere she was	fened white faced her lips parted her

 aware of an agony of pain now-an end-	eyes staring she stood regarding it her

 less aching but it was very far down	bosom stirred violently under her gasping

 she was keeping it hidden away down there	breaths

 by the force of her will but she knew that	 guy-guy she whispered through

 it was there waiting to force its way up and	dry lips her eyes sought garrys for con-

 ox-erwielm her-the instant that she was	firmation

 alone however she was able to smile in	yes-guy he admitted quietly

 spite of it she was able to chatter about	 what do you know about it

   nothing-to jest-to flirt

   it was very strange to her - that she
 should be sitting there playing a part as
 though she were an actress in a play and
 knowing all the time that this was not she
 -as she vould be

   she had to struggle constantly against
 the mad desire to rise and pound the table
 and scream  listen-all of you there
 is a dead man upstairs-and they think i
 killed him

   the desire to tell all the world about the
 dead man was-at times-almost irresis-
 tible it was only by thinking of garrys
 steady gray eyes that she could control it

   the thought of garry gave her strength
 -confidence he was so cool so absolute-
 ly safe and sane and dependable she felt
 suddenly very tired and wanted to creep
 into his arms and rest but-the lights
 went up the negroes bowed themselves out
 of view the band struck up another popu-
 lar number and smiling katherine got up
 to dance

   meanwhile holding her ermine coat care-
 lessly about her joan olcott crossed the
 floor and found garry in the hallway be-
 yond there was a vague look of anxious
 expectancy in her strange eyes

   you sent for me youve something
to say to me-about guy da costa

    yes he answered quiedv  will you
 come upstairs a moment please

    is that necessart

  yes

   her frown deepened but without further
 question or protest she followed him he
 threw open the door to the little french
 drawing-room for her

   she passed in and as her glance flashed
 from silvers-round the little room-she
 saw the covered body by some strange
 instinct she sensed that it was he she stif-

  he threw back the cover-and she
screamed-hoarsely in agony it was
dreadful-the most dreadful cry they had
ever heard-the shriek of a soul in tor-
ment

   my god  she cried then dropping on
her knees beside him murdered

  her lips just framed the word she bent
over him - touched him - as though to
make sure that she was really seeing this
then-for an instant-she was motionless

  garry touched her shoulder and urged
her to rise while silvers restored the white
covering she got up mechanically

   guy she whispered as though to her-
self  dead-murdered-and only a half
hour ago-or less-he spoke to me she
looked at garry  it isnt true i cant
believe it it cant be true i cant realize
it

   you dont know who could have done
it asked garry

  she gazed toward the covered figure
again-starded

   of course she murmured  some-
body has done it somebody killed him

  here was relief for her pent up feelings
-here was an oudet for the violent pas-
sions that strained at their bonds within
her

  whoever it is-well find him she
cried with clenched fists and blazing eyes

 we must find him-do you hear ill
give every cent ive got to bring him to
jusdce 

   have you any idea who he is asked
garry studying her

  she hesitated-looked up frowning

   no she said slowly  no though it
might be half a dozen men who are jeal-
ous of him or women he has trampled
underfoot there came a strange bril-
liance into her eyes her red lips smiled
scornfully  all are not like me she add-

ed  he struck me-and i kissed his
hand he left me-and i begged him to
come back why god knows he never
loved me fie never made me happy he
just - used me and laughed but i was
never happy until he came into my life i
havent been happy since he left me

  great tears welled up into her eyes and
rolled down her cheeks

   you and da costa danced together
once-did you not asked garry casually

   yes when he first came to new york
after the war he was still in uniform
when i met him do you remember how
handsome he looked in his uniform i was
mad about him from the first and i offered
him the job-just to keep him near me i
didnt know then what a wonderful dancer
he was

   you danced on one of the roofs did
you not

   yes-but only for a few weeks mr
milbume-who was interested in me then
-compelled me to give it up i wanted to
give him up instead but guy wouldnt let
me guy was not so prosperous in those
days and mr milbumes generosity is wrell
known guy and i went on seeing each
other anyway-until mr milburne found
it out somebody told him ive always
thought it was mable
i  mable repeated silvers

   yes-mable scott

   the little red-haired girl whos dancing
with him here-or was put in garry

   yes she had just begun to dance with
him then-and she was keen on him-as
most women are mr milburne quit me
and when he quit guy quit mable an-
nexed them both you see i dont kid my-
self he never cared a hang for me-it
was just mr milburnes bank roll while
i controlled it guy stuck to me wtien
mable got her hands on it guy began to
get chummy with her he never stopped
to think that id given up just about every-
thing i had for him he never thought
about anybody but himself

  her tone was bitter her eyes glistened
with unshed tears

   isnt it the limit she went on broken-
ly  how a woman will sacrifice everything
for a good-for-nothing like guy-and snap

her fingers at the men that-that are really

decent and on the level

  garry nodded

 and yet knowing just how worthless
he wras you still cared for him he asked

   cared for him she repeated looking
at him  i loved him so much that i
wanted to die when he left me i never
took to drink or dope until then ive
never loved anybody else in my life but
guy i loved him so much that-there
arent any words to say it it burned in
me it drove me crazy men never love
as much as i loved him

  garry leaned forward fixing her with his
eyes and seized her wrist

  you loved him enough to kill him
he cried sternly

   yes she answered without flinching
 and i would have killed him too only
some one else did it first i wish to god it
had been i oh to feel that knife going into
his throat to make him cringe and suf-
fer to wipe that accursed smile off his
face if it had only been i if it had only
been i

the little girl in green

is eyes held hers she did not seek
to evade his glance

   well he said gravely  whether
it was you or another we shall soon know
for i believe that nothing happens in this
world that is not led up to by a sequence
of events and these events are links in the
chain that bind the murderer with his vic-
tim you cant efface these events you
cant destroy a single link in the chain
they are unalterable and sooner or later
-they are sure to be disclosed

   links in the chain she repeated medi-
tatively  that is true isnt it and
she turned from him to the covered body
in the corner and then back again  so
one cannot escape the consequences of ones
misdeeds can one there is really no past
-no future there is just one long unin-
terrupted present no break no wiping
out and beginning again no new start
its hard-this world isnt it
the dance of death



     it is what one makes it said garry
  she shrugged and reddened her lips-re-
  paired the damage to her eyelashes-the
  havoc her tears had wrought she studied
  herself in the tiny mirror of her vanity
  box and suddenly she laughed her laugh-
  ter ringing hard and bitter in that tiny
  room

    even now i think of appearances as
  though it mattered how i look-whether
  any one fancies me or not inside-im
  burned out there is an emptiness that you
  cannot even conceive of because my
  world revolved around him i thought only
  of him all my plans included him to
  win him back-to make him care-to hold
  him and you thought i might have done
  this to myself-robbed me of everything
  she laughed again-the laughter giving
  place to sobs and then she buried her face
  in her arms and gave way to her violent
  overwhelming grief both men stood help-
  less awed by it

   the moments lengthened gradually
 the force was spent she raised her head

     well she gasped finally looking at
  them

    you spoke to da costa a few moments
  before his death said garry  out there
  on the stairs 

     yes 

     what did you say to each other

    she drew a long breath with difficulty

    i begged him to come back he was
annoyed and said he would not he said
he had other plans he said i must be a
fool not to realize that he was bored with
me and he asked me please not to annoy
him again he was brutal-hateful

  and you

  i lost my temper i told him he
couldnt use me and then dispose of me so
easily i told him i would pay him back
for everything then he laughed and said
he didnt want to seem rude but he had a
good deal on his mind and for me to write
it out and mail it to him with that he
left me and came in here and slammed the
door

   what did you do then

   i went back to my table

   did you tell any one what had hap-
pened between you and da costa

    her eyelids quivered slightly

     no she answered looking straight at
 him but something in her manner-some
 subtle change from her previous attitude-

 aroused his suspicions instantly

     you are not telling me the truth he

 cried

    i am why should i tell any one
 whom should i tell such things

    he debated

    who else is in your party who else
 is with you here he asked

     moffat fielding she answered reluc-
 tantly

     moffat fielding he repeated vague-
 ly trying to associate the name with some
 half-forgotten facts

     the son of jim fielding of toledo
 put in silvers

    ah-yes cried garry brightening
  he married some follies girl - and his
 father chucked him out

    yes - dolorez lorraine but theyre
 not living together any longer

     i know she got tired supporting him
 what is he doing now

     bootlegging answered silvers before
 the girl could speak  and selling dope i
 think

     you cant bring a boy up the way hes
 been brought up - giving him everything
 hes ever wanted-letting him go his own
 way always and then throw him out into
 the world to shift for himself he does
 the best he can cried joan fiercely

     so hes a friend of yours said garry

    a friend not exactly she answered
 grimly  we dont have many friends in
 our class of society some of us just find
 ourselves on the same level and hang to-
 gether thats all fieldings a rotter at
 least thats what youd call him i just
 call him weak and badly started off a lot
 of us arent what we could have been if
 wed got off to the right start but its a
 lot easier to go down hill than up and
 some of us just havent got the natural
 strength or character to climb i havent
 neither has he and that gives us a kind of
 fellow feeling we can be ourselves with
 each other and thats rather a relief

  so you told moffat fielding how da
 costa had treated you said garry


argosy-allstory weekly

  she looked at him-shrugged

   yes she admitted yielding  i told
him i was so full of it i had to tell some
one i was burning up inside but he
didnt do it dont waste your time
hounding him better question mable
 you dont like mable do you said
silvers

  joan smiled

   not much she answered coolly  i
guess i envy her you see i cant figure
things out in my head-things that would
be best for me and then go ahead and do
them-no matter who is hurt by them-no
matter what damage they cause mable
can she can shut her eyes to everything
but mables best interests she hasnt a
real feeling or a real emotion in her im
different but im no fool i see how
much further mable gets with her system
and i envy her because i cant kill the
heart in me and play the game the way
she does

   and you think mable may know some-
thing about this

   she might it seems more likely than
that moffat would do it-just to avenge
me you see he doesnt love me were
just pals

   but-you are disposed to protect him
arent you

   yes the maternal instinct in me-
damn it

  garry smiled

   well there can be no harm in my hav-
ing a little talk with him can there

   xo-o-only that lies-i mean its a
shame to subject him to this sort of inqui-
sition he wont stand it the way i have
hes got nerves

   ill be easy on him promised garry
and turning to silvers he added  will
you go and ask him to come up say miss
olcott wants him

    let vie go  cried the girl anxiously

   no-please you see for the sake of
clearing this matter up quickly we must
make it absolutely impossible for you to
warn him or advise him its for his own
sake-to help establish his innocence 

   yes i see she agreed sighing

  silvers left the room joan sat moodily
gazing into space

   i hate to think of to-morrow-and all

the to-morrows to come she said slowly
 without hint in them-or any hope of his
coming back they are going to be so-
empty they were empty enough before
he turned up-but i did not know then how-
wonderful days and nights could be you
see i had never really cared for any one
before - this way but now - i knozi-
and i dont know how i am going to face
them i dont know how i am going to
endure them

   but he was so unworthy said garry

   yes i know but-that doesnt make
it any easier i tried to think of that when
he left me it didnt help you dont care
whether they are worthy or not when you
feel this way its a curse i wish to god
it were  lying there now-dead-and he
were here alive and well in my place its
easier to die than to live its over
quicker

  garry said nothing he was thinking of
katherine - and wondering if guy had
meant anything like this to her-wondering
what there had been in the man to inspire
such devotion and his heart ached for
her-laughing and dancing down below
as though nothing had happened

  in the silence lengthening between them
silvers threw open the door and ushered
fielding in

  he was a young man very handsome
that is his features were finely modeled-
almost too finely his hair was very fair
and brushed until it shone his mouth
sulked his lashes were quite long and sur-
prisingly dark in comparison with his fair
hair handsome he was-but weak-look-
ing and now he looked quite nervous and
helpless as his eyes wandered from garry
to joan

   u moffie cried the girl impulsively re-
sponding to his look of anxious entreaty
but garry cut in

    fielding he said sternly  i regret to
inform you that a man has been murderes
in this room to-night and we sent for
you-

  he got no further again fieldings eyes
flashed from joan to the covered body on
the floor and his face growing pale as
death he cried out
the dance

   i know its guy da costa but she
didnt do it it was the other one-the
pretty one-the little girl in green

   moffie-for gods sake cried joan
 you dont know what youre saying

   dont i he responded taking hold of
the back of a chair for support and his
voice came slowly dearly with great de-
liberation  i am saying that katherine
kendall killed him i saiv the whole

thmgr

chapter ix

heavy heavy hangs over her head

there is something reckless some-
thing abandoned something lawless
and barbaric about jazz under the
spell of it katherine found herself getting
on very well laughing swaying flirting
devilishly there was color flaming in her
cheeks now and her eyes danced-those
strange eyes of hers that had a trick of
changing color with the gown she wore
they had been blue-black at dinner half
closed languorous they were green now
and had odd lights in them

  like the lamp that flares up with added
brilliance just before it bums out she was
shining with a radiance that had never
been hers before-but it was a radiance
that had a new daring in it

  stuyvie nettleton who had known her
for years and had never been particularly
attracted to her - he preferred the more
naughty and generous beauties of the re-
gion west of the avenue-came up to-night
to beg for a dance and as she nodded and
danced off with him-for to-night she re-
fused no one-he whispered in her ear bis
lips brushing her cheek

 what is it you were a bud until to-
night to-night you have bloomed into a
rose-a tea rose with a crimson heart-and
a sweetness that is simply overpowering 
she smiled

   to-night she whispered back mys-
teriously  i have come to realize how im-
minent death is-and that life is short-
and i have been wasting time

   so now you are going to live he
asked his heart beating faster

of death

   now i am going to live she repeated

trembling she was wondering how much
time there would be left her-after the in-
quiry in that room upstairs was finished-
wondering if she would be dragged through
the hideous publicity of investigations a
public trial-and she thought of the sleep-
ing draft that she had obtained from the
old family doctor after endless persuasion
and the employment of all of her wiles-
that sleeping draft that he had warned
her might prove fatal if she took too much

  but nettleton had not the vaguest con-
ception of the dark thoughts that flashed
behind her reckless glance holding her
closer until he could feel the wild beating
of her heart against him he breathed with
difficulty

   there is so much that i could teach
you-about living he whispered

  u is there she asked leading him on
and the music throbbed and screamed
and beat wildly it was easier to be quite
mad to music like that

  you see he went on boldly  i have
lived so much longer than you i have
sought for happiness along so many roads
i can save you a lot of vain pursuits and
all of my experience is yours to command
 it must be the glamour of hell he feels
about me thought katherine but she did
not say it instead she said

   strange-you have known me almost
since childhood and you have never asked
me to dance before

   you have never been like this before
he answered  until to-night you have
been a pretty child to-night you are a
woman palpitating with life and the joy
of living thrillingly alive and real human
-my kind i have often vaguely felt that
this side of you must exist and might be
brought out but i have never had energy
enough to try experiments so i just wait-
ed and now-some one else has tried--
and succeeded if it was guy da costa
i shall be grateful to him forever

  his name turned her cold she could
not answer

   not that it matters went on nettle-
ton suavely  all that concerns me is-
that some one has wakened the sleeping
beauty-with a kiss and she wants more

kisses her lips plead dumbly for them
her eyes beg for them

  his clasp tightened his cheek brushed
hers she was stifling-felt she must col-
lapse in another moment if that screaming
beating vibrating jazz went on

  and then young coleman cut in he
was still young enough to hate the older
man and all that he represented-money
without toil or effort-success with many
women not one of whom had really cared
-a flippant view of all that was really
worth while in life-the perfection of every-
thing that didnt matter and nothing that
did

    may i break he asked politely cold-
ly meaning more than that he wanted to
finish the dance with katherine

  it would have been against all ethics to
refuse but nettieton yielded her up un-
willingly katherine as she changed part-
ners was conscious of an inner feeling of
relief but her face in no wise betrayed her
she smiled after the departing nettieton
and called  thanks -she smiled up at
young coleman and murmured

  well-tjiis is nice

  and she thought that it was nice-there
was something distinctly nice about this
boy who was trying so hard and so awk-
wardly to be a man he looked almost
grotesquely clumsy dancing-as most col-
lege boys do-but he was really very light
and very graceful-and guided perfectly

   i wish we could go home he said sud-
denly after dancing for several moments
in silence

   why asked katherine curiously
looking up at him

   i dont know

  u arent you having a good time

   not very he answered frankly
 theres something wrong guess im
feeling kind of  down  to-night

  she wondered whether he sensed the
thing that was hanging over them - the
dead man in the room upstairs-the pursuit
of the murderer - the awful danger that
was overshadowing her he did not seem
like a sensitive type who might sense such
things

   youre on the crest of the wave all
right-arent you he added presently

  oh yes she answered  im having
 a whirl

  i wonder he said gravely  it seems
 that way but-

  but what she gasped staring

  i suppose im an ass but i feel as if
 -underneath-youre not so happy

  funny boy she murmured nestling
 closer

  if i can do anything you know he
 said  the usual hero stuff if ever you
 should need a friend-

  nice boy she whispered

 and then-stanton wilcox cut in and
 the jazz went on and on and on-and men
 and women danced and drank and smoked
 and laughed and whispered together and
 bartlett behind his screen of palms looked
 on alertly through eyes that burned som-
 berly out of a gray set face

 chapter x

 accusation flies from lip to lip

 upstairs silvers and garry were
 staring at fielding in frank umaze-
 ment

  do you realize what youre saving
 cried garry  do you mean to say that
 you saw miss kendall kill guy da costa

  yes answered fielding  thats ex-
 actly what i mean

 no no protested joan olcott

  dont believe him he isnt responsible
 -really he couldnt have seen such a
 thing he was downstairs-with me-at
 my table besides-he has taken a dislike
 to miss kendall ever since guy has been
 interested in her-and when moffie dislikes
 any one-hell stop at nothing

 fielding remained quite calm through all
 this-and smiled

  i know what i saw he said as joan
 ended

  how did she kill him asked garry
 then

  how

  yes-in what way-with what sort of
 weapon

 fieldings eyes wandered swiftly toward
 the covered body there was nothing there
 to give him a hint he parried
the dance of death



     i cant say exactly how he said
  all i know is-i heard him cry out  my
 god youve done for me and i heard her
 say  i meant to i thought it all out
 its only what you deserve 

     if this is true said silvers  it was
 deliberate premeditated murder do you
 understand that young man this testi-
 mony of yours is liable to send a young
 girl to the chair

     thats what i heard he reiterated
 stubbornly

     i tell you he isnt responsible hes
 under the influence of drugs protested
 joan  he always is he has a habit of
 telling the most unlikely tales-and swear-
 ing to them it isnt that he intends to lie
 really he believes them himself his im-
 agination plays tricks with him i tell you

 i know him

     how is it that you heard all this and
 still didnt see how the murder was done
 asked garry

     i was hiding answered fielding

  where

 his eyes wandered

  in the other room he answered

  why didnt rou interfere - or make
 some outcry afterward

  i didnt want to get drawn into it-
 on joans account

  so and what happened after miss
 kendall said that it was only what da
 costa deserved

 fielding hesitated

  i dont know i heard him fall then
 i sneaked out of the other cloor and went
 back to my table 

  what other door was that you sneaked
 out of asked garry

  the door to that room in there

  but there is no door to that room in
 there said garry quietly

  no door he repeated

  only that one that you see no door
 to the corridor outside

 fielding looked confused
 i i told you he didnt see anything or
 hear anything put in joan  he was
 with me-at my table-all the time

  dont keep saying that he cried fu-
 riously turning upon joan  cant yon
 see they want to make you the goat and

 they will too if you dont look out i
 dont care whether theres another door or
 not i dont remember how i got out i

only know she killed him-katherine ken-
dall she killed him

   he bit at his finger nails his eyes shift-
 ed warily from silvers to garry and there
 was a defiant hunted look in them

   come now-why do you want to im-
plicate her asked garry quietly

   she killed him nobody else she
did it

    god bless me i believe hes saying all
 this to clear me gasped joan laying her
 hand on fieldings arm and turning him
 round toward her  are you you foolish
 kid she added more gently  it isnt at
 all necessary you know and think of that
 poor girl if they believe your tale-think
 of the fix shell be in

   bah shes got money you can get
away with anything in this town if youve
got money he muttered  thered have
cops in here long ago if id been sus-
pected 

    you see said joan simply turning to
 the others  he just made all that up to
 shield me hes a regular guy all right
 hed come through

   fielding straightened up a bit with pride

    you said it he admitted

  you mean - you did invent that
story asked garry

  he looked at joan she nodded encour-
agingly

   sure he mumbled somewhat sheep-
ishly and dropped his head

   silvers and garry drew a long breath of
relief

    can you beat that asked joan

    well i thought maybe you did do it
he explained  and i didnt want to see you
arrested-youd have a hard tijjjp to get
off i knew the kendall girl wouldnt
and i guess she had cause enough to want
to kill him-same as the rest of us that
knew him not that i have it in for the
kendall girl-but she was the only one i
could think of on the spur of the moment
her name just popped into my head

   he looked up anxiously at the others

   its right-what she said he added
indicating joan with a jerk of his head


argosy-allstory weekly

 i didnt leave her table t dont know
anything about it at all 

  garry leaned fonvard fixing the boy
with his eyes

   did she leave the table-miss olcott
he asked

   no she didnt leave either-until you
sent for her

   but i did you know i did moffie
she protested  i came up to the ladies
room to powder my nose thats when i
met guy on the stairs she explained turn-
ing to the others

  c oh yes-then you did said fielding
it was plain he cared nothing for the truth
he thought only of shielding joan

   do you realize that you are liable to
get in very wrong with the authorities if
you persist in evading the questions and
deliberately falsifying asked garry stern-
ly  do you want to be held for perjury
or as an accessory after the fact

  he sneered

   im not afraid he said his bravado
was superb

   dont be foolish moffie weve noth-
ing to fear-either of us said joan
 tell them whatever they want to know-
frankly

  he looked at her

   sure-if you want me to he said
graciously

   i do she assured him

  well he said then turning impa-
tiently to garry  fire away what is
it

  you knew guy da costa pretty well
didnt you

   too damned well he answered grimly
 you know that old song dont you- he
made me what i am to-day thats the
bird i met him in the service-royal
flying corps i was just out of college
then hadnt graduated-just quit to en-
list didnt even drink then i had my
first drink with him  what the hell he
said  well all be dead in six months
lets whoop er up while weve got the
chance and maybe we didnt whoop er
up gambled drank took dope gee
the pace we went in france it d have
been all right if we had got smashed up at
the finish but we didnt and when we

came back-well-i just didnt want to
settle down again thats all family tried
to make me but i couldnt id got kind
of used to it all dyou see

   i guess they never did understand him
much said joan as fielding halted
 any more than my family understood
how to handle me families you know
are to blame for a lot of things not that
they mean to be not that they dont try
their damnedest but-were not all alike
-are we and they dont understand

   it wasnt as if id been a hero said
moffat fielding  i just wasnt much of
anything-but a rotter-from the start

   did you see much of da costa-after
you both came back asked garry then

   yes i saw him all the time i intro-
duced him around some he didnt know
many people here then when he got him
self fixed in right he shook me at first
avhen i wanted to go back home he used
to laugh at me and say  hell you went
to france and fought the damned boches
didnt you you saved the country for
them have a good time while youre
young theres time enough to settle
down my mother used to write for me
to come home she sent money regularly
-still does but im ashamed to go back
now 

   and while you were going about with
da costa you knew most of his friends i
suppose

   all of them i guess answered field-
ing

   perhaps you can help us then to sin-
gle out one or two who might be capable
of a deed like this-and who had sufficient
motive

  moffat fielding thought for an instant

   who knows what any one is capable
of i dont know w-hat im capable of my-
self as for murder- guess almost any
one might do it-given reason enough and
nearly all of da costas friends had plenty
of reason you see he just couldnt play
fair never did with any one i was his
 buddy  and he didnt w ith me youre
going to have a hard time finding the mur-
derer that way

   it begins to look like it admitted sil-
vers to garry
the dance of death



   but thats the only way we can pos-
sibly do it since there seem to be no clews
said garry

   no clews repeated fielding glancing
again toward the covered body

    a wallet with some bills in it and visit-
 ing cards said silvers shrugging hand-
 kerchiefs and three keys fie was killed
 with one of my steak knives

   fielding looked up sharply

   three keys he repeated  well-
they ought to lead to something

  garry and silvers exchanged a glance

   how so asked garry

   why-one key probably unlocks the
door of his apartment said fielding  and
the other two keys might open some chest
or cupboard there that would reveal new
evidence lets have a look at them 
silvers advanced toward the body again
and threw back the covering joan turned
aside fielding drew nearer fascinated
gazing down in horror and loathing at the
stiffening corpse but the fat little man
was too absorbed in saving himself from
ruin to be upset by sentimental or super-
stitious considerations he fumbled in the
dead mans pockets and brought forth the
flat leather key case with the three keys
in it

  fielding took the case gingerly and re-
garded the keys

    thats his latchkey he said picking
 it out  and thats obviously the key to
 some cabinet or strong box and that -
 he whistled-- thats also a front-door key
 i wonder whose

chapter xi

on a mission at mdnicht

i ts going to be a delicate mission-en-
i tering da costas apartments and
searching his effects said garry slow-
ly  and yet i agree with fielding here
that it may be a swift and simple route to
the identity of the murderer

    its the only thing to do agreed sil-
 vers  were not making much progress
 here at least we havent found out much
 so far and it looks to me like weve gone
 as far as we can go

  he looked thoughtfully from garry to

joan and from joan to fielding

   how about your going up there with

fielding now he asked garry

   now repeated garry hesitatingly

  he was loath to leave the king of clubs
while yet the mystery remained unsolved
loath to leave katherine in such jeopardy

   sure now insisted silvers  weve
got to go through with this investigation as
far as we can go by ourselves-so long as
weve started and we havent got any too
much time left before the guests will be
wanting the doors opened id be in a hell
of a fix with the cops if i couldnt turn
over the murderer to them when i call them
in to take charge of the body-and im not
intending to get into any more trouble than
im in when i open those doors at day-
break im going to hold somebody for this
murder ive got to-thats all

  he stood over the body of da costa-a
sinister little figure-and looked down at it
the body was still uncovered-and a ghast-
ly sight it was rigor mortis had begun-
the jaw had dropped-the eyes had set and
were staring glassily

  somebody killed this chap he said
grimly  somebody in this house to-night
weve found two people who might have
done it miss kendall-and miss olcott
here maybe theyre both innocent i
dont know but you can go gamble on
this if i havent got any more conclusive
evidence by dawn im going to turn both
these women over to the police

  the others stared at him garry and
fielding were speechless joan caught her
breath with a little smothered gasp

   now youre in this to save the ken-
dall girl he went on turning to garry
 and youre trying to save joan olcott
he added to fielding  well-you can
both go to da costas rooms together-and
look about if you find evidence there
that  settle this thing-fine if you dont
-youll come back and say so because im
going to hold both avomen here till you
come back and meanwhile youll kind of
watch each other

  the eyes of the two men met apprais-
ingly challengingly

    this thing is no game to me see said


argosy-allstory weekly

silvers its damned serious - and i
mean every word im saying im not go-
ing to be ruined if i can help it im go-
ing to get out from under no matter who
has to face the music thats that

    will you give me your word you wont
prpceed against either of these girls until
we get back asked garry quietly

   yes

    do you think we can get into da cos-
tas apartment without any difficulty
asked garry then turning to fielding

    sure answered fielding confidently
 ive been there hundreds of times they
all know me around there

    all right said garry  lets go

  and to silvers he added  how do we
get out

    not the front way answered silvers
 that might attract too much attention
you know guy arranged that nobody was
to be let out on any account before day-
light god knows why he hit on that idea
-but it was just crazy enough to catch
em-and its certainly turned out fine for
us-now that this has happened 

  he indicated da costas body with his
foot

    fortunately he went on slowly  we
got a few private exits-planned em in
case of trouble with these revenue agents
-and one of em  come in handy now
this way

   they turned to follow silvers out of the
little french drawing-room

   may i go back to my table asked
joan with an uneasy glance toward the
corpse

    yes-and wait there until further no-
tice answered silvers rather gruffly

  but young moffat fielding took her by
the shoulders and looked straight into her
eyes

    and dont wtorry-trust me he said
 im going to see you through

   she smiled with tears in her eyes and
left them the thunder and swing and
beat of the music downstairs lent her
strength as she passed once more into the
smoke-filled noisy supper rooms and as
she crossed the floor her eyes met those of
katherine kendall who was swaying in
the arms of huxley reed but there was

no flash of recognition nor of understand-
ing though their positions to-night were
so nearly alike they were dwellers in dif-
ferent worlds

   below around a bend in the stairs sil-
 vers swung back a huge mirror that slid
 easily and noiselessly on grooved tracks
 and revealed a narrow iron stairway lead-
 ing downward the night air-cool and
 damp-blew in upon them as they stood
 on the little platform landing they but-
 toned their coats and put on their hats

    theres a door at the bottom that
opens outward at the slightest shove said
silvers  but you have to have a key to
open it from outside heres the key

   garry took it

    when you come back come in this
way added silvers  i will be looking
out for you 

    and you will do nothing until we re-
turn inquired garry again

   nothing

   the mirror slid back into place shutting
 them out garry in the lead they started
 downward in silence

   there was no moon visible in the over-
cast sky-no stars were out and a cold
wind blew with the hint of coming rain in
it a dismal night strangely suitable
garry thought to the things that were hap-
pening

    the unreality of it all held his attention
 if-a few hours before-he had been told
 these things might occur he could never
 have conceived it possible to come in
 contact with murder-with mystery-with
 all the things one reads about in the news-
 papers and never vaguely associates with
 oneself or ones own kind it was incred-
 ible-and yet-true-hideously true

   that katherine-of all girls-should be
caught in a web like this katherine so
dainty so delicately reared so carefully
bred-so sheltered-so guarded in spite
of her willfulness - her recklessness - she
was so innocent so young and fresh and
really so unspoiled and to think that by
this time to-morrow the world might be
gazing at her pictures in the newspapers-
linking her name with da costas-discuss-
ing the murder and her possible guilt
the daxce of death



 it was a maddening thought he put it	usual for guests to present themselves dur-

  from him with a desperate effort for calm-	ing the absence of the host and let them-

 ness	selves in with his latchkey however

 here we are cried fielding shoving	fielding and garry were prepared to de-
 open the door at the bottom of the steps	mand permission to enter-even to accom-
 and they stepped out into the street the	plish their entrance by force if necessary
 stairway had been placed along the side of	but force was not necessary
 the building shielded from view from the	 yes sir said the dignified doorman
 street by a kind of grilled-iron wall the	 mr da costa left word that anybody who

   main entrance was just around the corner

     well find taxies in front said garry

    they started briskly each man fired with
 the burning desire to end the situation and
 save a woman

    the odillon called fielding to the
 chauffeur who stepped out to solicit pa-
 tronage as they approached the stand

   apparently he knew the building-as
 what chauffeur in town did not the odil-
 lon on park avenue was one of the latest
 most exclusive most expensive apartment
 houses in the latest fashionable section
 only motion-picture magnates or popular
 song writers or new war-made millionaires
 could afford to live there it was built of
 granite and marble and furnished with the
 objets dart wrested from ravished france
 and italy the staff of attendants and
 servants had come en masse from the con-
 tinent of europe

    so da costa afforded the odillon
 said garry with a grim smile  he did
 himself well

    oh - always answered fielding

  there was very little he denied himself
 in the way of pleasure or comfort if his
 was a short life it was certainly damned
 merry 

    but he didnt exactly spread peace and
 comfort about him as he went observed
 garry

    no-not exactly 

   the cab drew up at the entrance to the
 odillon and they descended a very pom-
 pous and impressive lackey in maroon and
 gold livery received them just inside the
 huge doors of the entrance hall

  i want to go to mr da costas apart-
 ment said fielding

 he said it somewhat determinedly and a
 little defiantly for he felt it quite within
 the bounds of possibility that they would
 be refused admission it was certainly un-

 called was to be admitted

  they followed a second lackey to the
elevator pondering this

chapter xii

pulsating love letters

the elevator-man opened the door and
directed them to an apartment on
the twelfth floor of the building
slamming the door and vanished garry
and fielding looked about them

   evidently somebody is expected here
said garry  or da costa would not have
left orders like those

   a woman most likely answered
fielding with a shrug  in any case its
nothing to do with us - or our mission
here

  he inserted the key in the lock and
opened the door there was stillness with-
in a night light was burning dimly in
the hall and by its light they advanced-
without being challenged

   his valet leaves after he is dressed for
the evening volunteered fielding  never
stays at night gets here in time to bring
him his coffee in the morning

   the chances are theres nobody here
then said garry

   most likely not 

  garry thereupon turned on the lights
and he whistled with astonishment as his
eyes wandered over the rooms they were
handsomely decorated and in perfect taste
a mans rooms the dwelling place of a man
of cultivated tastes and more than ordinary
accomplishments that is-the living room
and dining room and foyer were the bed
chamber which he did not see until after-
ward was rather different

   he got them furnished said fielding
 or else had some decorator in


argosy-allstory weekly

   garry picked up a book that was lying
on the small table near the davenport

  nietsche he exclaimed and then
smiled  with the pages still uncut he
added

   fielding moved to the hearth and beck-
oned for garry to come and see in the
open grate some one had been burning pho-
tographs and letters quite a heap of
them half destroyed lay there--grim tes-
timony to da costas extensive acquaint-
ance among the fair sex not a personal
photograph had been left about

   what do you make of that asked
fielding

    looks a little as though some one had
been here before us answered gariy
 and yet-who could have known of the
murder the doors were locked no one
-except ourselves-has left the club

   but the murderer-knowing what he
was about to do-might have come here
first suggested fielding

    thats true admitted garry  but
in that case it must have been a premedi-
tated thing-carefully planned it didnt
seem like a deliberate cold-blooded kill-
ing

    is there any use in our looking for evi-
 dence here asked fielding

    why not look-so long as we are here
said garry  the most careful person
sometimes overlooks something

   fielding shrugged-and went round the
grand piano that stood in the window niche
with a chinese embroidery over it and a
bowl of orchids on top-strange orchids of
a rare species colored with reds and yel-
lows there was a small carved cabinet
half hidden away there

    my guess is that the key fits this he
 observed

   but the cabinet proved to be without
a lock-and empty along the further wall
were bookcases but the key to them was
sticking in the lock

    lets try the bedchamber suggested
garry leading the way and he smiled as
he crossed the threshold

   there was a huge low sleeping couch
piled with innumerable pillows of different
colored silks there was a torchlike lamp
on each side of the bed and a canopy over

 it tapestries gay-colored stuffs and em-
 broideries lined the walls with here and
 there a nude of the modern french school
 or a black and white after beardsley a
 small marble statuette of a shepherd boy
 piping stood in the window bathed in
 moonlight from out of doors and in an
 amber glow from the hanging lamp above
 him across from him stood da costas
 desk-locked and the second key that
 fielding had fitted it

    it will be empty fielding predicted
 as he inserted the key in the lock  some
 one has already been here to cover traces

    no harm to look said garry

   and then the desk opened under field-
 ings hand-and it was not empty direct-
 ly in front stood a picture of katherine-a
 beautiful picture - with yours k-
 scrawled across the bottom of it in her big
 careless hand and beside the picture lay
 a little stack of letters-in the same hand
 -four letters addressed to guy da costa
 there was nothing else to be seen

    katherine kendall breathed field-
 ing triumphantly  and some of her let-
 ters i guess theyre evidence in the case

    i guess not answered garry reaching
 for them but fielding was before him

    whats the idea he cried turning to
 look up at the older man

    ill take those said garry without
 directly replying his jaw was squared

    oh you will will you-and let joan
 face the music with the cops i guess not
 they go back to silvers

   they eyed each other in open antago-
 nism now-each man fighting for the wom-
 an he loved fielding still sat before the
 desk his hands closed over the letters
 garry stood over him

    i dont see that this has anything what-
 ever to do with the murder said garry
 calmly  she was interested in da costa
 well-we all know that half the town
 knows it she wrote him letters well-
 is that going to add anything to the knowl-
 edge we already have letters are such
 intimate personal things i dont like the
 idea of having hers paraded before the pub-
 lic gaze

    because you are in love with her said
 fielding grimly
the dance of death



 perhaps	 read them cried garry  read let-

  well i am in love with joan and	ters addressed to somebody else

 im just as anxious to clear her as you are	 its either that-or turn them over

 to clear katherine kendall these letters	we came here to get any information that

may do it	we could about da costas affairs-and

 nonsense protested garry they	weve got some you dont suppose im

 cant have anything to do with the murder	going to let you destroy these unread do

i tell you	you

  exactly you tell me but you dont	garry drew a long breath

 know any more than i do about it sup-	 very well well read them he

        a sprig of myrtle

                  there is a bed of myrtle by the house-

                    it is the flower of memory they say-

she set it gayly there a gay young bride-

                      it blossoms there for strangers now to-day

                     yes strangers now are living where she dwelt

                    there in the house to which she came a bride-

                      love in her eyes and roses at her belt

                      her young adoring mate tall at her side

                    and oh she needs to pass it every day

                      as to her little cottage she goes by

                     above the stranger voices glad and gay

                     does she i wonder hear her first born cry

                     do well remembered voices call to her

                    the laughing voices of her vanished brood

                    as she goes by and does she wince to see
                    the strangers in the doorway where she stood

                     to give her mothers kiss to each in turn

                     when each had learned in turn to say farewell

                      the door she softly closed at last one day
                      upon the past that she had loved so well

                     do figures that her eyes alone can see

                   walk down the garden paths and bend above
                   the flowers that had known her tender touch

                    had blossomed to reward her care and love

                  does she remember who of us can say

                    we marvel as we see her passing by

                    for she goes gallantly upon her way

                    and ever walks erect with head held high

                     and always on her lips there is a smile

                    but once i saw her when no one was by

                    pause at the gate uncertainly a while

then slowly turn and enter haltingly

                     but once within she swiftly sped to where
                     the myrtle bloomed-a moment there caressed
                     its blossoms then she rose without a tear

                    and passed-a sprig of myrtle at her breast

 ii-the black sheep of the family

it did not require big headlines in the
morning newspapers to give the vernon
colfax case a sensational aspect the
facts were sufficient to start the buzz of
scandal in business and social circles and
for more than the proverbial nine days it
was one of the wonders of little old new
york

  he was reported to have taken one of the
hudson river steamers-it was the night
boat to albany-and was assigned to room
thirteen on the starboard side of the vessel

during the night some one heard terrible
groaning and later there was a loud splash
on that side of the steamer in the morn-
ing they found his room empty and a hardly
decipherable scrawl which intimated that he
was  tired of it all  and expected to
 end  his misery in short order

  the family was well-known and at one
time exerted considerable influence in the
community but for years it had been run-
ning to seed vernon was generally looked
upon as the black sheep of the family al-

the first story of this series appeared in the argosy-allstory weekly for october

the adventures of peabody smith



   though if the truth be known very few of

  them were snow-white naturally the
  steamboat episode caused the wagging

   tongues to work overtime but if they were
 surprised at the story of the reported sui-
 cide the astonishment turned to shocked
 amazement when it was announced that
 vernon colfax had taken out a life insur-
 ance policy for fifty thousand dollars just
 a year and a day before the episode of
 room thirteen on the hudson river steamer

   in view of all these facts peabody smith
 was not surprised when he received a mes-
 sage asking him to call on richmond wil-
 liams the president of the harrison insur-
 ance company leaning back in his leather-
 covered chair the veteran insurance man
 told the detective that while they were per-
 fectly willing to pay all just claims they
 wanted to make sure that the colfax case
 came within that category he said they
 wanted a thorough investigation made of
 the case and if smith would assure him that
 the claim was legitimate the beneficiary
 would receive his check without further ado

    technically i suppose he remarked
 stroking his white mustache  we might in-
 sist upon the production of the body of the
 deceased but we do not intend to go that
 far absence of fraudulent intent and
 proof of death will satisfy all of our require-
 ments

   peabody smith listened carefully and said
 little he knew that the company had been
 swindled in the past and he was also aware
 that a sense of personal vanity prevented
 president williams from acknowledging that
 fact also he sensed a feeling of disap-
 pointment on the part of the business man
 smiths fame had preceded him and the in-
 surance expert expected to see an altogether
 different person peabody looked anything
 but the conventional detective he resem-
 bled neither the detective of fact or fiction
 he was not a miracle man nor was he the
 awkward investigator who is supposed to
 typify the real sleuth he was just himself

   he was wrell-dressed but so inconspicu-
 ously that president williams ten minutes
 after he left could not remember what he
 wore he had on a darksuit of clothing
 fitted to the season and wore a violet in his
 buttonhole

     a

  what the head of the insurance company
did know was that peabody smith had been

the chief of detectives in one of the large
cities that he had been an indian fighter
in his native town that he had served for
twenty years in the united states secret
service that he had an honorable record in
the bureau of investigation in the depart-
ment of justice and had been an officer in
the intelligence bureau of the war depart-
ment during the world imbroglio he asked
a few pointed questions and then rose to
go he smiled at the business man in his
sad way

   as i get it mr williams you are tired
of having your company swindled and
youre willing to go the limit to prevent it
in the future

   but said the other  i didnt say this
was not a legitimate claim and i said
nothing about the past

   quite true but i know because its my
business to know what has happened in the
past my scrapbooks cannot talk but they
often tell me things that are useful in my
profession you need not apologize for what
you are doing my favorite author will tell
you that josh billings says very truly that
the man who gets bitten twice by the same
dog is better adapted for that kind of busi-
ness than any other

  when peabody smith left the room
richmond williams had a better opinion of
him than when he entered

  that night the detective spent several
hours in reading up on the vernon colfax
case and when he had concluded he had
fully digested all that had appeared in the
newspapers the first thing in the morn-
ing he called upon ralph colfax the last
of the family and the beneficiary of the in-
surance policy he knew in advance a great
deal about that branch of the clan

  to begin with they were not connected
with those of the same name who had made
such an impression upon the public life of
the country but having the same name
they had benefited by the similarity their
parents had died early and the two sons
had continued living in the old family home
which was in the lower section of the city
almost surrounded by business houses the
boys existed like indians domestic life


argosy-allstory weekly

as it is known in most well-regulated homes
was unknown there they slept there and
that was all

  peabody found ralph colfax at home
and the surviving member of the tribe re-
ceived him with a certain rough-and-ready
courtesy the detective presented himself
as a representative of the insurance com-
pany and said that his purpose was to as-
certain the facts concerning the death of
vernon colfax he lit a pittsburgh stogie
and handed one to his host and that little
move established a fellowship at once

    as i understand it said the detective
 you were with your brother on this un-
fortunate trip

    yes replied the other  but there isnt
much to add to what has already been pub-
lished its not a pleasant thing to say it
but vernon has always been the black sheep
of our family he left home suddenly about
a year ago i believe that he went to
south america but i am not sure of the
details because he was always reticent about
himself and his personal affairs all that i
know is that he went away unexpectedly
and-

   that interrupted peabody  was just
after he had taken out the insurance policy
in your favor

   it was not in my favor was the
prompt retort  and i dont know why you
make such an intimation it was made out
to his heirs

   but you are the only remaining heir
 well yes was the grudging assent
 if you want to put it that way

   pardon me for interrupting you said
the detective in a pleasant voice but with an
unsmiling face  go ahead with your story
 well vernon came home about a week
ago and he seemed to be in pretty bad
shape he was a nervous wreck i wanted
him to see a doctor but he wouldnt listen
to the suggestion he lay around the house
like a man who was tired of life

   you didnt send for the doctor you
say did any one else see him

   yes was the reluctant reply  miss
fordson called here one evening and spent
a few minutes with him

   and might i ask why miss fordson
called to see your brother

    miss amelia fordson replied ralph
with the patient air of an adult who is try-
ing to instruct a child  is an old friend
of the family at one time she expected to
marry vernon but there was never an actual
engagement between them he began to go
wrong and although she has always been
very friendly and sympathetic the idea of
their marriage became more and more im-
possible

    so when she heard that he was home
after a long absence she was naturally anx-
ious to see him suggested peabody smith

    exactly yet it might have been better
if she had not come the effect upon both
of them was bad she left in tears and he
was a nervous wreck he said he couldnt
stay in the city any longer that he had to
be on the move it was then that i sug-
gested the adirondacks the trip up the
hudson on the albany boat was only the
first part of the journey

   you were-to go with him

    certainly he wasnt fit to go alone
events have demonstrated that i tried
to get adjoining rooms but that was im-
possible and we were on different sides of
the boat on the morning of the departure
i had a lot of little details to look after and
i sent vernon on ahead in a taxicab may-
be that was a mistake but he reached the
boat all right and lay down in his berth at
once after that he refused to leave his
stateroom i carried his meals to him but
he scarcely ate anything but when i left
him on that fatal night he seemed more
composed than he had been at any time
since his return home the rest you know
the next morning we found his room empty
the man who had the adjoining cabin
heard him groaning during the night heard
his door open around twelve oclock and
then heard the splash as though a body had
been thrown overboard

   the detective nodded his head solemnly
and sat for some moments in reflective si-
lence

    mr colfax he said presently  what
sort of a looking man was your brother
ralph rubbed his chin and gazed into
space as though he were trying to conjure
up a picture of his dead relative when
he spoke it was with deliberation
the adventures of peabody smith

    he was of medium build had dark hair
and a dark mustache but l cant say that

he had any peculiar characteristics by
the way heres a picture of him-

   he walked to the other side of the room
followed by the detective on the wall hung
a photograph of two young men they
were ralph and vernon colfax it was
taken when both of them were at their best
peabody looked intently at the picture of
ralph and then at the reality in the flesh
the counterfeit presented a manly robust
fellow the original showed marks of dissi-
pation in every line of his countenance his
face was puffy and his eyes were sunken and
underscored with dark rings

    you look very much alike in that pho-
tograph  remarked peabody  might i
ask if you were twins

   no there were two years between us
vernon being the younger but i believe
there was a strong family resemblance
now mr smith ive told you all i know
and i beg to be excused if the harrison
insurance company wants to get the reputa-
tion of fighting just claims im ready for
them ill get the best counsel in new
york and give them a battle theyll remem-
ber

    who said anything about contesting the
claims

   why you-i-well what are you here
for if it is not for that purpose

    my dear mr colfax rejoined the old
man soothingly  this is a big claim and we
are at least entitled to reasonable proof of
death

    all right was the stubborn reply  ill
see that you get it

n

  peabody smith smoked dozens of pitts-
burgh stogies during the next twenty-four
hours and tim borke declared that he
drank enough english breakfast tea to float
a battleship but tim alwaystalked in ex-
aggerated terms yet the old man was do-
ing a lot of thinking and he sat by the hour
reading josh billings and wrinkling his
brows until the crows feet around his eyes
seemed to be multiplied by the hundreds

in the meantime he made a careful ex-

amination of the stateroom on the hudson
river boat that had been occupied by ver-
non colfax nothing had been disturbed

there was a bottle of medicine and some

pills in a box his shoes were under the
berth and his bathrobe hung on a hook
behind the door a book lay face down-
ward on the berth as though he had been

reading before he reached his tragic deci-
sion peabody shuddered not at the
thought of the tragedy but at the idea of
any one treating a book in that fashion

  captain harcourt of the steamer was not
able to shed much light on the mystery
he said that he was on deck when the man
arrived he was bundled up as a sick man
was apf to be wore a long overcoat green
goggles and walked with the aid of a cane
he spoke in a querulous voice and swore
when he was told that his brother had not
yet come he went to his room at once and
remained there the other details as re-
lated to the detective by ralph colfax
were confirmed by captain harcourt

  that afternoon peabody called upon
amelia fordson at her apartment on west
ninety-fourth street she was a cultured
woman who without being rich had always
been in good circumstances the detective
contrived to gain her interest at the outset
and she readily answered his questions she
knew all about the incident of the hudson
river boat or at least had read about it in
the newspapers she shook her head sadly

   im not at all surprised she admitted
 and all that i can do is to feel intense
regret that such a promising young man
should have had such a sad ending

   im told said peabody gently  that
you called on him a few days before this
unfortunate occurrence

   yes she replied  i had not seen him
in years and you can imagine my surprise
when i was called on the telephone and
heard his familiar voice

   he called you himself

   he did and asked me if i would not
come and see him for old-times sake i
knew that it would be an or deed but i could
not find the heart to refuse im sorry now
because i would have liked to remember
him as he was in the good old days-a
handsome manly bright boy


argosy-allstory weekly

   you found him changed then

   greatly he was alone in an armchair
in the sitting room he kept the shades
down saying that the light hurt his eyes
he looked positively ghastly-like an old
man in fact he seemed to have aged
twenty years in the few that had passed
since we met he said little but held my
hand as if he did not want me to go after
that he grew nervous and hysterical and
i felt that it was wise to leave him the
next thing i heard was this dreadful story
about the albany boat

   did you ever hear where he went when
he left the city unexpectedly

    never definitely but it was my belief
that he went to the argentine in iffy short
visit we had no opportunity of talking about
his trip

   peabody smith was very thoughtful after
he left miss fordson he stopped at the
office of one of the steamship companies
and also made some inquiries at the rail-
road offices when tim burke his assist-
ant met him that evening the old man was
engaged in going over a mass of time-tables

   whats the matter boss he asked
 getting ready for a vacation

   i dont know whether youd call it a
vacation responded peabody grimly
 but i start for buenos aires to-morrow
the veteran did not go away for rest and
relaxation and yet he managed to combine
pleasure with business when he reached
the lively capital of the argentine he was
in the right mood to pursue his investiga-
tions his fame had preceded him and
he found the police officials eager to assist
him in his quest it wtas several days be-
fore he was able to trace the movements of
vernon colfax and in the meantime he
made it his business to haunt the streets of
the community admiring the skyscrapers
and the up-to-date methods of the most im-
portant city in south america

   in less than a week he had located some
men who knew colfax when he was living
in buenos aires and a day later he found
a young woman who had been one of the
admirers of the castaway it was in the
older and the quainter part of the city that
peabody smith made the acquaintance of
mercedes runyon and when she found

that he w as interested in senor col lax
there was nothing that she was not willing
to tell him

  they sat on the balcony of a white-
washed brick house the lattice work
around it was covered with creeping flow-
ers and off in the distance they looked
down upon a beautiful rose garden the
girl talked of love in a low tender voice
that made the detective experience twinges
of conscience as well as of sentiment

    to know senor colfax said the girl
softly  was to love him there was no
thought of marriage between us and yet
i would have married him at any time if he
had asked me he drank alas more than
was good for him but always he was the
gentleman he was so romantic too one
night nothing would do but that he should
have a heart tattooed upon his right arm
that he said was to always be a reminder
of me

   filled with these reminiscences peabody
called on the local police the next morning
and was given a most astonishing bit of in-
formation they too had traced the
american and they found that he had been
drowned two years before the sad-faced
detective scratched his sparse hair and tried
to puzzle out the mystery how could
vernon colfax be drowned from a hudson
river steamboat six weeks ago if he had
died in buenos aires two years earlier

    are you sure about the date

    as sure as we can be about a matter
that will never be entirely cleared was
the reply

   it seems that on or about the date men-
tioned the steamship bolivar had taken a
party of excursionists on a trip along la
plata river that stream is subject to
sudden and violent gusts of wind on this
occasion a storm broke with unexampled
fury and a score of the passengers were
lost vernon colfax had been on the boli-
var and it was generally believed that he
was among the missing some of the bodies
were recovered and that of the american
was identified by a brother who was said to
have come from new york but there
were no official records of this and senor
smith would have to rely on word of mouth
for his proof
the adventures of peabody smith



  peabody was not the kind of man to
show emotion but he had difficulty in re-
straining himself at this announcement

he made it his business to have another

meeting with mercedes runyon on the
flower-covered balcony the girl did not
know what had become of vernon colfax
he had left suddenly without telling her
where he was going she recalled the dis-
aster of the bolivar but never dreamed
that he was on that boat with  many
bodies that were never identified it was not
surprising peabody left without enlight-
ening her this was indeed a case where
ignorance was bliss

  he returned to the united states with
the problem unsolved but with much fogd
for thought his first call was at the office
of the harrison insurance company
president williams had heard of his trip
to the argentine but he was frankly dis-
appointed when he learned that the colfax
case was still in the lumber room of unex-
plained mysteries

   ralph colfax was in here yesterday
he said  and he raised a regular row he
says that if he does not receive a check for
fifty thousand dollars within three days
hes going into court ordinarily i would
not mind a threat of that kind but colfax
has a sharp lawyer who has been waiting
to get a shot at us for years and if he does
im afraid that he will give us the kind of
advertising we are not seeking he hasnt
a thing on us but you know we pride our-
selves on making payment twenty-four
hours after death and this thing has now
run into the second month

  peabody smith never looked more like a
funeral director than he did at this moment
his face was the personification of unre-
lieved sadness he spoke in melancholy
tones

    he gives us three days does he well
mv guess is that two days will serve our
purpose that is unless all of my plans
go to smash now while im here i would
like to have an interview with the doctor
who examined vernon colfax when he took
out this policy

  dr hendricks was in his office at the
time and he was only too glad to talk to
the detective about one of the most impor-

tant policies that had been issued by the
company peabody smith sat down in the

armchair that was offered him and curled

up his legs with the air of a man whose

whole object in life is his personal comfort

when he spoke it was with that delibera-
tion that was so disconcerting to those who
were not familiar with his mannerisms

 doctor he began  m view of the
size of this policy i suppose you gave the
applicant a pretty thorough examination
the physician bristled up in the attitude
of one who finds himself on the defensive

   i personally examined vemon colfax
he replied  and i found him to be a pretty
good risk if i hadnt i wouldnt have
recommended the issuance of the policy
 just so commented the detective in
the style of a cross-examiner  and just
what did you find his condition to be

   almost normal i should say the
man was not perfect physically when i saw
him he gave evidence of having dissi-
pated but in spite of that his heart and
lungs were in number one condition

 what kind of a policy did he take
 the usual one i think there was
one clause in it which said payment should
not be made if death was caused by suicide
within one year after it was issued

   and vemon colfax jumped overboard
just a year and a day after that policy was
handed over

    so im told but i cant be held re-
sponsible for that can i

    presumably not in making the exami-
nation did you cause mr colfax to strip
dr hendricks laughed

   i did i remember that he protested
against that at the time but i told him it
was usual in the case of big policies

    now doctor think well over this ques-
tion did you notice anything unusual
about the applicants body about his
right arm for instance

   peabody smith leaned forward as he put
this query the crows feet were thick
about his gray eyes there was anxiety in
the grave face he waited for the answer
with manifest impatience dr hendricks
on his part took his time in replying
when he spoke it was with great positive-
ness


argosy-allstory weekly

    yes there was one unusual thing for
a man in his station in life i noticed that
his right arm was tattooed

   peabody smith relaxed he fell back in
his chair with a sigh of relief the strained
look left his face he had the answer he
expected and he smiled and as he smiled
his whole countenance lit up with the same
effectiveness that comes when a light is
struck in a dark room he paused for a
moment then he put another question that
was intended to clinch the first

    and will you tell me what object was
tattooed on his arm do you recall that
 oh yes answered the doctor now
fully restored to good humor  i dont
think i could ever forget that it was an
anchor

   the unexpectedness of this puzzled the
detective it put the case back to where
it had been in the beginning

    now doctor he said persuasively
 dont you think your memory has failed
you dont you think the object that was
indelibly printed on his arm could have
been a heart

    no i dont was the sharp retort of a
man who was in danger of losing his temper
 if you think im not capable of telling
the difference between an anchor and a
heart then im not fit for my job
peabody smith had to be satisfied with
that and he left the office and went to his
apartment and indulged in a session with
josh billings it was his theory that the
wit and wisdom of the phonetic humc-ist
always had the effect of sharpening his
mental faculties his sense of momentary
defeat soon passed away and when tim
burke called an hour later he found the old
man in fine fettle

    my boy he cried  im going to wind
this case up to-morrow-just twenty-four
hours before the time limit that has been
fixed by ralph colfax its as clear as
noonday to me now i only need one little
link to complete the chain of evidence
maybe ill get it and maybe i wont at
all events im going to stake everything on
a single throw of the dice

    ill bet on you replied the faithful
one  and im shocked to hear you use the
language of the gambling fraternity

 you neednt be was the calm retort

 because life itself is a gamble and the
man who takes the biggest chances usually
gets away with the biggest pot

iii

                                                

  peabody smith was at the office of
richmond williams at ten oclock the next
morning the president of the insurance
company greeted him warmly and hoped
that he had found what he wanted

    not yet was the cheerful retort  hut
ill eat my shirt if i havent got it before
the clock strikes twelve

   as they talked a messenger brought in
a card stating that ralph colfax wanted
to see mr williams the president glanced
at the card and frowned in perplexity
smith caught sight of the name and ex-
claimed

    good nothing could be better bring
him in and we may be able to expedite the
matter

   ralph colfax entered with a frown upon
his dissipated face he glanced from one
to the other

   im tired of being jockeyed by you
two he exclaimedc and if i dont get my
money right away therell be trouble in this
town

    colfax cried peabody smith  youre
nothing but a bluffer and you know it
if i were mr williams id take you by the
seat of the trousers and fire you out of the
office

  the bland president was surprised at
this language he didnt like it at all as
for ralph colfax it produced exactly the
effect that had been intended by the de-
tective he turned on smith hotly

 he cant do that and neither can you

   the sad-faced detective took off his coat
and rolled up his sleeves the two men
looked at him in amazement he spoke
to colfax with spirit

   take off your coat and get down to
business im twenty years older than you
but if i cant trim you in one round ill tell
mr williams to give you that check before
you leave the room come on now and stop
your bluffing

colfax squared off as though he pitied
the adventures of peabody smith



  the poor old man he took his place in
the center of the room

  no no exclaimed peabody take

off your coat and roll up your sleeves
ralph followed instructions reluctantly

but with an evident desine to satisfy this

eccentric person he tossed his coat on a
chair and then rolled up his shirt sleeves
peabody watched him with fascinated in-
terest as the operation was concluded
the detective let out a cry of triumph
ralph colfax had bared his right arm
and imprinted thereon was the design of
an anchor

   you are my prisoner shouted pea-
body smith  i arrest you for trying to
defraud the harrison insurance company
out of fifty thousand dollars

   the man turned pale and all of the life
seemed to leave him he dropped into a
chair like a limp rag

  tim burke had entered the room and
he stood there beside president williams
awaiting the orders of his chief but pea-
body did not seem to see either of them
he proceeded to address ralph colfax

    you nearly got away with it but that
anchor sealed your doom i suspected you
from the start but it was hard to make all
of the little pieces dovetail that was be-
cause there was so much truth in your fic-
tion it was true that vernon went to
south america and when you identified
him as the victim of the steamboat accident
you first conceived the idea of making easy
money by fooling the insurance company
you looked so much like your brother that
you had no difficulty in impersonating him
in the examination with the insurance com-

next week  the

pan but you had to wait a whole year

to overcome the suicide clause you hood-
winked miss fordson all right your voice
is that of your brother and she thought it
was vernon who called her on the tele-
phone then by the aid of a darkened
room and some dever make-up you con-
tinued the hoax when she made her brief
call

   but protested the prisoner feebly

 my brother went on the boat ahead of

me

   he did not cried peabody  it was
you who went on the boat wrapped in
blankets and well disguised you changed
to your real self in the cabin and then came
out and circulated among the passengers
and talked constant to the captain of your
sick brother in his bunk you did the
groaning that night and you tossed the

irishman i liked him at once-i think we
all did

he began characteristically near the end
rather than the beginning of the events i
knew he must have to tell us

 i got away he chuckled grinning
more broadly than ever  but where i was
going to search me and who the deuce
are you if you dont mind my asking how
did you ever get to this god-forsaken
place

i smiled  you tell us about yourself
first then ill tell you about myself you
are the earth-man weve been hearing about
arent you-the man tao captured in wyo-
ming and brought here with him

 they caught me in wyoming all right
whos tao

 hes the leader of them all

 this story began in the argosy-allstory weekly for october

chapter xiv

the ruler of the light country

however pleased the newcomer was
to see me i had no difficulty in
assuring him with equal truth that
my feelings matched his the first surprise
of the meeting over we took him to the
living room where lua greeted him with
dignified courtesy and we all gathered
around to hear his story

  he was i saw now not more than twen-
ty years old rather short-perhaps five feet
six or seven inches-and powerfully built
with a shock of tousled red hair and a hand-
some rough-hewn face essentially mascu-
line

  he seemed to be an extraordinarily good-
humored chap with the ready wit of an
the fire people



   oh well they brought me here as
you say and i guess theyve had me about
all over this little earth since they stuck
me in a boat and lord knows how far we
went we got here last night and when
my guard went to sleep i beat it he
scratched his head lugubriously  though
what good i thought it was going to do me
i dont know thats about all i guess
who the deuce are you

   i laughed

   wait a minute-dont go so fast start
at the beginning whats your name
oliver mercer

  his face grew suddenly grave  my
brother was killed up there in wyoming-
thats how i happened to go there in the
first place

   mercer i exclaimed

  he started  yes-why you dont
think you know me by any chance do
you

   no but i knew your brother-that is
i know bob trevor who was with him
when he wras killed- hes one of my best-
friends

  the young fellow extended his hand
 a friend of bob trevors-away off here
dont it get you just

   miela interrupted us here to translate to
her mother and anina what he said

  mercer went on

   the assumption is you people here are
not working with this gang of crooks i got
away from-this tao am i right in
thinking so

   youre certainly right that far i
laughed

   i felt more than i can say a great sense
of relief a lessening of the tension the
unconscious strain i had been under at this
swift jovial conversation with another hu-
man of my own kind

   yes youre right on that this tao
and i are not exactly on the same side
ill tell you all about it in a minute

   then were working together

    yes

    well all im working for is to get back
home where i came from

   you wont be when you hear all ive
got to say

  he started at that then with sudden

change of thought his eyes turned to anina
the girl blushed under his admiring gaze

   say shes a little beauty isnt she
who is she

   shes my sister i said smiling

  for once he was too dumfounded to
reply

  miela had finished her translation now
and as she turned back to us spoke in
english for the first time during the con-
versation

   do you know why it is they brought
you here from the twilight country she
asked mercer

  this gave him another shock  why i-
no that is-say how do you happen to
talk english is it one of your languages
here by any chance

  miela laughed gayly

   only we three in all this world speak
english i know it because-

  i interrupted her

   suppose i tell him our whole story
miela then-

   thats certainly what i want to hear
said mercer emphatically  and especial-
ly why it is that im not supposed to want
to get back to where i belong
jviy explanation must have lasted nearly
an hour punctuated by many questions and
exclamations of wonder from young mer-
cer i told him the whole affair in detail
and ended with a statement of exactly how
matters stood now on mercury

   do you want to hurry back home to
earth now i finished

   duck out of this i should say not
why weve got a million things to do
here	t

  his eyes turned again toward anina

   and say-about letting those girls
keep their wings im strong for that lets
be sure and fix that up before we leave

  it was not more than half an hour later
when the kings guards arrived to conduct
us to the castle meanwhile young mercer
had discovered he was hungry and thirsty
as soon as he had finished eating we start-
ed off-he and i with lua and miela the
guards led us away as though we were pris-
oners forming a hollow square-there were
some thirty of them-with us in the center
we attracted little attention from passers-


argosy-allstory weekly

by the few who stopped to stare at us
or who attempted to follow were briskly
ordered away

  occasionally a few girls would hover
overhead but when the guards shouted up
at them they flew away obediently

  the kings castle was constructed of
metal and stone-a long low rambling
structure flanked by two spires or minarets
giving it somewhat an oriental appearance
each of these minarets was girdled halfway
up by a narrow balcony

  the first room into which we passed was
small seemingly an antechamber from it
announced by two other guards who stood
at the entrance we entered directly into the
main hall of the building at one end of it
there was a raised platform on this seat-
ed about a large table were some ten or
twelve dignitaries-the kings advisers
they were i saw all aged men with beard-
less seamed faces long snowy-white hair to
their shoulders and dressed in flowing silk
robes

  the king was a man of seventy-odd
kindly faced gentle in demeanor he bore
himself with the dignity of a born ruler
and yet his very kindliness of aspect and
the doddering gravity of his aged council-
ors seemed to explain at once most of the
trouble that now confronted him

  we stood beside this table-they cour-
teously made way for lua to sit among
them-and all its occupants immediately
turned to face us

  our audience lasted perhaps an hour and
a half altogether i need not go into de-
tails i was right in assuming that the king
desired to help us prevent tao from his at-
tempted conquest of the earth this was
so but only in so far as his actions would
not jeopardize the peace of his own nation
he sadly admitted his error in allowing
taos emissaries into the light country
but now they were there he did not see
how to get them out

  his people were daily listening to them
more eagerly and what was worse the po-
lice guards themselves seemed rather more
in sympathy with them than otherwise a
slight disturbance had occurred in the
streets the day before and the guards had
stood apathetically by taking no part

above all else the king stoutly protested
he would have no bloodshed in his country
if he could prevent it

  in the neighboring towns of the light
country-the nearest of which was some
forty miles away from the great city-the
situation was almost the same reports
brought by young women flying between
the cities said that to many tao also had
sent emissaries who were fast winning con-
verts to his cause

   do all these people who believe in tao
expect to go to our earth when it is con-
quered i asked miela  how can they
-so many of them-hope to benefit in that
way arent they satisfied here

  miela smiled sadly

   no people can ever be satisfied-all
of them that you must know my hus-
band they have many grievances against
our ruler many things they want which he
cannot give tao may promise these things
-and if they believe his promise it is very
bad

   he might come over here and try to
make himself king mercer said suddenly
 if its like that maybe he could do it
too with this grand earth-conquest getting
ready tell the king that-see what he
says

   he says that he realizes and fears it
miela answered  but he thinks that first
tao will go to your earth and he may never
come back so much may happen-

   so hes just going to wait i explained
 well were not just going to wait ask
the king what our status is

   ask him about me mercer put in
 are those tao men going to grab me the
minute i show my face on the street or
will he protect me

  miela translated this to the king adding
something of her own to which he evidently
agreed

   it is as i thought she said  he
believes he can present you to the people
as men of earth who are our guests and
that they will accept you in friendly spirit
most of them

  the king spoke to one of his advisers
who abruptly left the room

   he will call the people now miela
went on  and will speak to them from the
the fire people



tower-all who can leave their tasks to
come you will stand there with him he
will ask that we of the light country allow
you to remain here in peace among us
and this captive earth man of taos -
she laid her hand lightly on mercers
shoulder- he will ask too that he be
given sanctuary among us our people still
are kindly-most of them-and they will
see the justice of what he asks

  i suggested then that miela tell the king
that we had determined if we could to frus-
trate tao in his plans and showed her how
to point out to him that such an outcome
would if successful make his throne secure
and insure peace for his nation

  he asked me bluntly what it was i
thought i could do the vague beginnings
of a plan were forming in my mind  tell
him miela i think we can rid the light
country of taos emissaries-send them
back-without causing any disturbances
among the people ask him if that wrould
not be a good tiling

  the king nodded gravely as this was
translated

   he asks you how miela said next

   tell him miela that there are some
things that might happen of which he would
be very glad but which it might be better
he did not know you understand make
him see that we will be responsible for this
-that he neednt have anything to do with
it or know anything about it then if we
do anything wrong against your laws he
will be perfectly safe in stopping and pun-
ishing us

  miela nodded and began swiftly telling
this to the king as she spoke i saw his
eyes twinkle and a swift little series of
nods from the aged men about the table
made me know that i had carried my point
during the latter part of this talk i had
noticed the growing murmur of voices out-
side the castle the old man who had left
the room at the rings order came back

   the people now are gathering miela
said  in a moment we shall go up into
the tower

  the kings councilors now rose and with-
drew and a few moments later the king
without formality led the four of us
through the castle and up into the tower

  we climbed a little stone staircase in the
tower and came into a circular room some
sixty feet above the ground a small door-
way from this room gave access to the
narrow balcony which girdled the tower
the sounds of the gathering crowd came up
plainly from the gardens below we waited
for a time and then at a sign from the
king stepped together upon the balcony

  the gardens below were full of people-
gathered among the palms and moving
about for points of vantage from which to
obtain a view of the balcony most of
them were men and older women the girls
were nearly all of them in the air flying
about the tower and hovering near the bal-
cony staring at us curiously the women
were for the most part dressed as i have
described lua

  the men wore knee-length trousers of
fabric or leather and sometimes a shirt or
leather jacket although a difference of cos-
tume that made evident the rank of the
wearer was noticeable in both sexes all
were bareheaded with the exception of the
kings guards who were thus plainly dis-
tinguishable standing idly about among the
crowd	

  as we stepped out into view of the people
a louder murmur arose mingled with a rip-
ple of applause three or four girls hover-
ing only a few feet in front of us clapped
their hands and laughed the king placed
mercer and me on either side of him and
standing with his hands on our shoulders
leaned over the balcony rail and began to
speak

  a silence fell over the crowd they lis-
tened quietly but with none of that respect
and awe with which a people usually faces
its king

  miela whispered to me  he is telling
them about your earth and that you came
here to visit us in friendly spirit

  there were some murmurs of dissent as
the king proceeded and once some bolder
individual shouted up a question at which
a wave of laughter arose as it died away
and the crowd appeared to listen to the
kings next words a stone suddenly came
whirling up from below narrowly missing
the kings head a sudden hush fell over
the people at this hostile act then a tumult


argosy-allstory weekly

  of shouting broke loose and a commotion
  off to one side showed where the offender
  was standing

    mercer wheeled toward me his face
  white with anger

   who did that-did you see him
  which one was it

    the king began to speak as if nothing
  had occurred and an instant later several
  more stones whistled past us the commo-
  tion in the crowd grew more violent but
  it was evident that a great majority of the
  people were against this demonstration

      it is bfetter we go inside miela said
  quietly

    the king was shouting down to his
  guards now but they stood apathetically
  by taking no part

    another stone hurtled past us striking
  the tower and falling at our feet the
  king abruptly ceased his shouting and left
  the balcony as he passed me and i glanced
  into his frightened face i felt a sudden sense
  of pity for this gentle kindly old man so
  well-meaning but so utterly ineffective as a
  ruler

    i was about to pull miela back into the
  room when a girl flew up to the balcony
  railing as she balanced herself upon it i
  saw it was anina she said something to
  miela who turned swiftly to me

     she is right my husband we must
  not leave the matter like this they can
  have no confidence in you-our women
  most of all-if you do not do something
  now a sign of your strength now would
  make them respect you-perhaps one of
  those who threw the stones you could pun-
  ish

    i knew she was right most of the crowd
  was with us if we retreated now those
  against us would grow bolder-our appear-
  ance on the street might at any time be
  dangerous but if now wre proved ourselves
  superior in strength the popular sentiment
   in our favor would be just that much
  stronger at least that is the way it seemed
  to me

    i did not need to ask mercers opinion
  for at mielas words he immediately said
   thats my idea just give me a chance
  at them

    he leaned over the balcony  how are

we going to get down there its too far to
drop

  miela spoke to anina and they both flew
away in a moment they were back with
two other girls all four clung to the out-
side of the balcony railing and formed a
cross with their joined hands into this
little seat of their arms i clambered my
weight was too great for them to have lifted
me up but they fluttered safely with me
to the ground landing in a heap among the
people who had cleared a space to receive
us as soon as i was upon my feet the
girls flew back for mercer and in a moment
more he was beside me

   if we only knew who threw those
stones i said

  i stood erect and my greater height en
abled me to see over the heads of the people
easily	v

  miela laid her hand on my arm

   one of them i know his name is
baar a bad character he has caused much
trouble in the past

  she then told me hastily that she and
anina would fly up and seek him out merj
cer and i were to follow them through the
crowd on the ground

  the throng was pushing close about us
now although those nearest us tried to keep
away as best they could miela and anina
flew up over our heads and side by side
mercer and i started off the people
struggled back before our advance striving
to make a path for us at times the press
of those behind made it impossible for them
to give us room we did not hesitate but
shoved our way forward elbowing theni
away roughly

  suddenly some twenty feet ahead of us
i saw miela and anina come to the ground
and in a moment more we were with them
again

  the crowd was less dense here and about
us there was a considerable open space
miela pointed out a man leaning against the
trunk of a palm tree near by and glaring at
us malevolently

   that is he she said quietly  a very
bad man-this baar-whom many would
like to see punished

  mercer jumped forward but i swept him
back with my arm
the fire people



     leave him to me i said  you stand
  here by the girls if i need you ill
  shout

    the man by the tree was a squat little
  individual some five feet three or four
  inches tall and extraordinarily broad he
  was bareheaded with black hair falling to
  his shoulders he was naked to the waist
  exposing a powerful torso his single gar-
  ment was the usual knee-length trousers
  i thought i had never seen so evil a face
  as his as he stood there holding his ground
  before my slow advance and leering at me
  his cheek bones were high his jowls heavy
  his little eyes set wide apart his nose was
  flat as though it had once been broken

    i went straight up to him and he did not
  move there were certainly three hundred
  people watching us as i stood there facing
  him

     you threw a stone at your king i said
  to him sternly although i knew perfectly
  well he could not understand my words
  u you shall be punished

    i reached out suddenly and struck him
  in the face as smartly as i could with the
  fiat of my hand he gave a roar of sur-
  prise and pain and as soon as he could
  recover from my blow lunged at me with a
  snarl of rage

    as he came i turned and darted swiftly
  away i heard a shout of surprise from
  mercer  its all right he called
  wait

    i ran about twenty feet then turned and
  waited the man came on head down
  charging like a mad bull when he was
  close upon me i gathered my muscles and
  sprang clear over his head landing well be-
  hind him

    he stopped and looked around confused-
  ly evidently not quite sure at first what
  had become of me

    mercer gave a shout of glee and to my
great satisfaction i heard it taken up by
the crowd mingled with murmurs of sur-
 prise and awe

    i stood quiet and again my opponent
  charged me i eluded him easily and then
  for fully ten minutes i taunted and baited
  him this way as a skillful toreador taunts
   his bull the crowd now seemed to enjoy
  the affair hugely

  finally i darted behind my adversary
and catching him by the shoulders tripped
him and laid him on his back on the ground
a great roar of laughter went up from the
onlookers

  the man was on his feet again in an
instant breathing heavily for indeed he
had nearly winded himself by his exertions
i ran over to mercer

   go on i said  show them what you
can do

  the commotion of this contest had drawn
many other spectators about us now but
they kept a space clear pushing back hur-
riedly before our sudden rushes at my
words mercer darted forward eagerly his
first move was to leap some twenty feet
across the open space this smaller oppo-
nent seemed to give the mercutian new
courage

  he shouted exultantly and dashed at
mercer who stood quietly waiting for him
at the edge of the crowd

  mercers ideas evidently were different
from mine for as his adversary came within
reach he stepped nimbly aside and hit him
a vicious blow in the face the man top-
pled over backward and lay still

  i ran over to where mercer was bending
over his fallen foe as i came up he
straightened and grinned at me  oh
shucks he said disgustedly  you cant
fight up here-its too easy

chapter xv

the mountain conclave

 t is reasonable miela said thought-
i fully  and that our women will
help as you say-of that i am sure
we were gathered in the living room after
the evening meal and i had given them my
ideas of how we should start meeting the
situation that confronted us we had had
no more trouble that day after the en-
counter in the kings garden mercer and i
had followed the two girls swiftly home
we were not molested in the streets al-
though the people crowded about us wher-
ever we went

 why did none of baars friends come
to his rescue up there in the garden i
argosy-allstory weekly



asked miela  surely there must have been
many of them about

   they were afraid perhaps she an-
swered  and they knew the people were
against them there might have been se-
rious trouble for that is not their way-to
fight in the open

  her face became very grave  we must
be very careful my husband that they or
taos men do not come here to harm you
while you sleep

   why do you suppose they ever hap-
pened to bring me here in the first place
mercer wanted to know  thats what i
cant figure out

   they knew not that alan was here
said miela  i think they wanted to show
you to our people as their captive-one of
the earth-men

  mercer chuckled

   they didnt know what a good runner
i was or theyd never have taken a chance
like that

  i told miela then my plan for enlisting
the sympathy of the women of the light
country and for securing the active coop-
eration of the girls in ridding us of the
disturbing presence of these tao emissa-
ries

  we planned that whatever we did should
be in secret so far as possible mercer
and i talked together while miela consulted
with lua at length

  i explained to mercer that tao might at
any time send an expedition to invade the
light country

   how about that car we came from earth
in he suggested  he could sail over in
that couldnt he-if he should want to come
over here

  i knew that was not feasible in the
outer realms of space the balancing attrac-
tions of the different heavenly bodies made
it easy enough to head in any specified di-
rection but for travel over a planets sur-
face it was quite impractical its rise and
fall could be perfectly governed but when
it was directed laterally the case was very
different just where it would go could not
be determined with enough exactness

  miela turned back to us from her con-
sultation with lua

   in the mountains high up and far be-

yond the valley of the sun she said  lies g
a secret place known only to our women i
our mother says that she and i and anina 
can spread the news among our virgins to ff
gather there to-morrow at the time of sleep f
only to those we know we can trust will we
speak-and they will have no men to whom
to tell our plans to-morrow they will 
gather up there in the clouds among the
crags unseen by prying eyes and you
and our-our friend ollie -she smiled as
she used the nickname by which he had if
asked her to call him- you two we will
take there by the method you have told us

we will arrange up there in secret what it
is we are to do to help our world and
yours

  this in effect was our immediate plan
of procedure nearly all the next day mer-
cer and i stayed about the house while the
three women went through the city quietly
calling forth all those they could reach to
our conclave in the mountains

  they returned some time after midday
miela came first alighting with a swift
triumphant swoop upon the roof where
mercer and i were sitting

  one glance at her face told me she had
been successful

   they will come my husband she an-
nounced  and they are ready and eager
all of them to do what they can

  anina and lua brought the same news
when we were all together again mercer
and i took them to the garden behind the
house and showed them what we had done
while they were away

  it was my plan to have the girls carry
mercer and me through the air with them

for that purpose we had built a platform
of bamboo which now lay ready in the
garden

  miela clapped her hands at sight of it

 that is perfect my husband no diffi-
culty will there be in taking you with us
now

  the platform was six feet wide by ten
long it rested upon a frame with two
poles of bamboo some forty feet in length
running lengthwise along its edges these
two poles thus projected in front and back
of the platform fifteen feet each way run-
ning under them crosswise at intervals were
the fire people



other shorter bamboo lengths which pro-
jected out the sides a few feet to form han-
dles there were ten of them on a side at
intervals of four feet

  i found it difficult to realize the difference
between night and day since here on mer-
cury the light never changed i longed now
for that darkness of our own earth which
would make it so much easier for us to
conceal our movements miela relieved my
mind on that score however by explaining
that at nearly the same hour almost every
one in the city fell asleep the physical
desire for sleep was i learned much strong-
er with the mercutians than with us and
only by the drinking of a certain medicinal
beverage could they ward it off

  it was after the evening meal at a time
which might have corresponded to an hour
or so before midnight that the selected
eighteen girls began to arrive miela
brought them into the living room with us
until they were all together

  it was a curious gathering-this bevy of
mercutian maidens they all seemed be-
tween the ages of sixteen and twenty-three
-fragile dainty little wisps of femininity
yet having a strength in their highly devel-
oped wing muscles that was truly surpris-
ing

  they were dressed in the characteristic
costume i have described with only a slight
divergence of color or ornamentation they
were of only two types-jet black tresses
black eyes and red-feathered wings like
miela or the less vivid more ethereal ani-
na-blue-eyed golden-haired with wing
feathers of light blue

  when they had all arrived we went into
the garden behind the house in a moment
more mercer and i were seated side by side
on the little bamboo platform miela and
anina took the center positions so that they
would be near us the other girls ranged
themselves along the sides each grasping
one of the handles

  in another moment wre were in the air
my first sensation was one of a sudden
rushing forward and upward the frail lit-
tle craft swayed under me alarmingly but
i soon grew used to that the flapping of
those many pairs of huge wings so close
was very loud the wind of our swift for-

ward flight whistled past my ears look-
ing down over the side of the platform be-
tween the bodies of two of the girls i could
see the city silently dropping away beneath
us above there was nothing but the same
dead gray sky black in front with occa-
sional vivid lightning flashes and the rumble
of distant thunder

  underneath the storm cloud far ahead
the jagged tops of a range of mountains
projected above the horizon as i watched
they seemed slowly creeping up and forward
as the horizon rolled back to meet them

  for half an hour or so we sped onward
through the air we were over the moun-
tains now great jagged naked peaks of
shining metal towered above us with that
broken utterly desolate country beneath
we swept continually upward for the
mountains rose steadily in broad serrated
ranks before us

  occasionally we would speed up a nar-
row defile with the broken tumbling cliffs
rising abruptly over our heads only to come
out above a level plateau or across a canon
a thousand feet deep or more

  the storm broke upon us we entered a
cloud that wrapped us in its wet mist and
hid the mountains from our sight the
darkness of twilight settled down lighted
by flashes of lightning darting almost over
our heads the sharp cracks of thunder so
close threatened to split my eardrums

  the wind increased in violence the lit-
tle platform trembled and swayed i could
see the girls struggling to hold it firm at
times we would drop abruptly straight down
a hundred or two hundred feet with a great
fluttering of wings but all the time i knew
we werp rising sharply

  mercer and i clung tightly to the plat-
form we did not speak and i think both
of us were frightened certainly we were
awed by the experience after a time-i
have no idea how long-we passed through
the storm and came again into tlie open air
with the same gray sky above us

  we were several thousand feet up now
flying over what seemed to be a tumbling
mass of small volcanic craters in front of
us rose a sheer cliff wall extending to the
right and left to the horizon we passed
over its rim and i saw that it curved slight-


argosy-allstory weekly

ly inward forming the circumference of a
huge circle

  the inner floor was hardly more than a
thousand feet down and seemed fairly level
we continued on arriving finally over the
mouth of a little circular pit this formed
an inner valley half a mile across and with
sheer side walls some five hundred feet high
as we swung down into it i noticed above
the horizon behind us a number of tiny
black dots in the sky-other girls flying out
from the city to our meeting

  i have never beheld so wild -so complete-
ly desolate a scene the ground here was
that same shining mass of virgin metal tum-
bled about and broken up in hopeless con-
fusion

  great rugged bowlders lay strewn about
tiny caverns yawned fissures opened up
their unknown depths sharp-pointed crags
reared their heads like spires left standing
amid the ruins of some huge cathedral
there was indeed hardly a level spot of
ground in sight

  i wondered with vague alarm where we
should land for nowhere could i see suf-
ficient space even for our small platform
we were following closely the line of cliff
wall when suddenly we swooped sharply
downward and to the right with incredible
speed my heart leaped when for an in-
stant i thought something had gone wrong
then the forward end of the platform tilted
abruptly upward there was a sudden mo-
mentary fluttering of wings a scrambling as
the girls feet touched the ground and we
settled back and came to rest with hardly
more than a slight jar

  miela stood up rubbing her arms which
must have ached from her efforts

   we are here alan-safely as we
planned

  we had landed on a little rocky niche
that seemed to be in front of the opening
of a small cave mouth in the precipitous
cliffside i stood up unsteadily for i was
cramped and stiff and the solid earth
seemed swaying beneath me i was stand-
ing on what was hardly more that a narrow
shelf not over fifteen feet wide and some
thirty feet above the base of the cliff

  mercer was beside me looking about him
with obvious awe

   what a place  he ejaculated

  we stepped cautiously to the brink of the
ledge and peered over underneath us with
the vertical wall of the cliff running directly
down into it spread a small pool of some
heavy viscous fluid inky black and with
iridescent colors floating upon its surface
it bubbled and boiled lazily and we could
feel its heat on our faces plainly

  beyond the pool not more than a hun-
dred yards across lay a mass of ragged
bowlders piled together in inextricable con-
fusion beyond these a chasm with steam
rising from it whose bottom i could not
see-a crack as though the ground had sud-
denly cooled and split apart across the
entire surface of this little cliff-bound circu-
lar valley it was the same as though here
a tortured nature had undergone some ter-
rible agony in the birth of this world

  the scene which indeed had something
infernal about it would have been extraor-
dinary enough by itself but what made
it even more so was the fact that several
hundred girls were perched among these
crags sitting idle or standing up and flap-
ping their wings like giant birds and more
were momentarily swooping in from above
i had for an instant the feeling that i
was dante surveying the lower regions and
that here was a host of angels from heaven
invading them

  during the next hour fully a thousand
girls arrived there were perhaps fifteen
hundred altogether and only a few strag-
glers were hastily flying in when we decided
to wait no longer

  miela flew out around the little valley
calling them to come closer they came
flying toward us and crowded upon the
nearer crags just beyond the pool clutch-
ing the precipitous sides and scrambling
for a foothold wherever they could a
hundred or more found place on the ledge
with us or above or below it wherever a
slight footing could be found on the wall of
the cliff

  when they were all settled and the
scrambling and flapping of wings had
ceased miela stood up and addressed them
a solemn almost sinister hush lay over the
valley and her voice carried far she spoke
hardly above the ordinary tone earnestly

                          	a

the fire people



    and occasionally with considerable empha-
    sis as though to drive home some important
    point

      for nearly half an hour she spoke with-
    out a break then she called me to her
    side and put one of her wings caressingly
    about my shoulders i did not know what
    she said but a great wave of handclapping
    and flapping of wings answered her she
    turned to me with glowing face

       i have told them about your wonderful
    earth and taos evil plans and just now
    i said that you were my husband-and i
    a wife can still fly as well as they that
    is a very wonderful thing alan no wom-
    an ever in this world has been so blessed
    as i they realize that-and they respect
    me and love you for it

     she did not wait for me to speak but
   again addressed the assembled girls when
   she paused a chorus of shouts answered
   her many of the girls in their enthusiasm
   lost their uncertain footholds and fluttered
   about seeking others for a moment there
   was confusion

       i have told them briefly what we are
   to do miela explained  first to rid the
   great city of taos men sending them back
   to the twilight country and do this in all
   our other cities where they are making
   trouble then when our nation is free
   from this danger we will plan how to deal
   with tao direct for he must not again go to
   your earth

       and when all that is done i have said
    you will do your best to make our men
    believe as you do so that never again will
    our women marry only to lose all that
    makes their virginity so glorious

              the fire planet

    think i should explain now a little
   about the physical conformation of
   mercury-the  lay of the land so to
   speak-in order that the events i am about
   to describe may be more readily under-
   stood it has already been made clear by
    bob trevor i believe that mercury re-
   volves on its axis only once during the time
   of its revolution around the sun thus

       	a

      w- 

just as a similar condition always makes our
moon present very nearly the same face to
us so mercury presents always the same
portion of its surface to the sun

  it will be understood therefore that
theoretically there must be on mercury
but one spot where the sun always is di-
rectly overhead it could not be seen
however owing to the dense clouds this
spot approximates the center of the region
known as the fire country

  so far as i could learn it was here that
human life on the planet began certainly
it was the first region where civilization
reached any height when columbus was
discovering america great cities flourished
in the fire country-cities of untold wealth
and beauty now fallen into ruins like the
great cities of our own aztec and inca civi-
lizations

  the fire country was then like the
equatorial regions of earth-a dense tropic
jungle hotter than most temperatures we
have to bear but still by reason of its thick
enveloping atmosphere of clouds capable
of supporting life in comparative comfort

its inhabitants were dark-skinned but
rather more like our indians than negroid
races

  then several centuries ago-the exact
time is uncertain for no written records are u
kept on mercury-came the great storms

their cause was unknown-some wide-
spread atmospheric disturbance these
storms temporarily parted the clouds in
many places allowing the direct rays of
the sun to fall upon the planets surface

the resulting temperature destroyed all
life withered all vegetation with its scorch-
ing blast the inhabitants of the fire
country were killed by hundreds of thou-
sands their cities deserted their land laid
a desert waste

  these storms which it appears began
suddenly have returned periodically ever
since making the region practically unin-
habitable its surviving races pushed out-
ward toward the more temperate zone were
living at this time i am describing in a
much lower state of civilization than the
people of the light country-a civiliza-
tion of comparative savagery in the light
country they were held as slaves


argosy-allstory weekly

  this region-thus very aptly known as
the fire country-embraces a circular area
directly underneath the sun so far as i
could learn it extended outward roughly to
those points where-if it had been visible-
the sun would have appeared some halfway
between zenith and horizon

  lying outside the circle in a larger con-
centric ring is the zone known as the light
country entirely free from the equatorial
storms no direct rays of sunlight have ever
penetrated its protecting cloud blanket
here exists the highest state of civilization
on the planet

  beyond the light country in another
concentric ring lies the twilight country
it forms a belt about the planet beginning
roughly at those points at which the sun
would appear only a short distance above
the horizon and extending back to where
the sun would be below the horizon in
this region as its name implies there is
never more than twilight it is lightest at
the borders of the light country and fades
into night at its other side

  still farther beyond the twilight zone
lies the region of perpetual night and cold
-the dark country this area embraces
the rest of the planet comprising something
less than half of its entire surface here
is eternal night-a night of stygian dark-
ness unlighted even by the stars since the
same atmosphere makes them invisible

  the dark country so far as it has been
explored-which is very little-is a rocky
waste and a sea of solid ice that never
melts near the borders of the twilight
country a few people like our eskimos ex-
ist-savages with huge white faces and
great staring eyes there are a few fur-
bearing animals and birds but except for
this fringe of life the dark country is
thought to be uninhabited its terrible cold
making life in any form impossible

  so much in general for the main geo-
graphical features of mercury the great
city stands about halfway between the bor-
ders of the fire country and the edge of
the twilight zone this level marshland
the barren metallic mountains and a sort
of semitropic jungle partly inundated by
water comprise nearly all the area of the
light country

  from the great city through the watery
jungle extends a system of little winding
bayous-a perfect maze of them with hun-
dreds of intercommunicating branches-
which it would be almost impossible to
traverse without losing all sense of direc-
tion

  beyond these bayous into which their
sluggish currents flow lies the narrow sea
on its farther shore begins the twilight
country much of it a barren semifrigid
waste with a little level tillable land vast
rocky mountain ranges and a few forests

  in spite of its inhospitable character the
twilight country is fairly densely popu-
lated and i realized when i got into it
civilized life is exceedingly difficult to main-
tain there i understood then why th
twilight people were so envious of land
in the light country and in truth i could
not blame them for that or for looking
toward our earth with longing

  but just as the light country people
had defended their borders with implacable
determination so was i determined that
they should not invade my world either
and i was ready to stake my life and even
the lives of those i loved here on mercury
in the attempt to prevent them

chapter xvii

the fight at the bayou

miela proceeded to explain our plan
in detail to these fifteen hundred
enthusiastic allies it was my idea
to build several platforms similar to this
one on which mercer and i had been car-
ried up here into the mountains only some-
what larger we then proposed to seize
these emissaries of tao-there were not
more than eight or ten of them altogether
in the great city-capturing them at night
without alarm if possible and transporting
them summarily into the twilight country
my theory was that if they were to dis-
appear thus mysteriously the people of the
great city would have no particular cause
to make trouble afterward and we hoped
that the affair would soon be forgotten

  miela thought it practical for us to carry
them in this way across the narrow sea
the fire people



the lone city from which tao was oper-
ating was located near the edge of the
sea and if we gave them food they would
be enabled to reach it in safety in a day or
two the girls agreed enthusiastically with
this plan and we selected a number to carry
it out

  meanwhile we planned also to organize a
system of aerial patrols and detailed some
two hundred of the girls who in varying
shifts were to fly back and forth along the
borders of the sea over its light country
shore to make sure that tao did not at-
tempt to make a crossing by water

   cant they fly over as well as we can
mercer objected  their women fly too
dont they

  the women of the twilight country did
fly but for two reasons we did not fear
an attack from them in the air first
miela doubted that the women would con-
cern themselves in the affair they were stu-
pid and apathetic-fit only for child-
bearing the men might of course force
them to the attempt but even in that event
miela explained it would result in little
for generations of comparative inactivity
and the colder climate had made them in-
clined to stoutness their wing muscles
were weak and flabby and with their
greater weight of body they flew very
badly

   suppose tao should come over i sug-
gested to miela  i dont believe he will
-but if he should how could we stop
him

   by water he would come she an-
swered  in boats-small they are i think
those he has we could not stop him for
the light-ray he would bring but our wom-
en flying over the ocean would see him
coming and tell our king more we could
not do now

  you mean this patrol would give the
government the warning it wont obtain for
itself there would be war then the
people would arm to resist invasion

  miela smiled sadly

   there would be war alan but our
government-our people-do not look for
it they are like the peeta bird that hides
its head under its wing when it is threat-
ened

  the time of sleep was now nearly over
and wre thought it best that the girls should
fly back at once so that their arrival at the
city would cause as little comment as pos-
sible

  mercer and i seated ourselves on the
platform as before the twenty girls grasped
its handles raising it until they were all
upon their feet then at a signal we left
the ground the trip back seemed shorter
than coming up the girls all left the val-
ley together flying up helter-skelter and
circling about us as we flew steadily on-
ward

  near the great city the girls spread out
so as to approach it from different direc-
tions and thus attract less attention al-
though the time of sleep was not yet over
and we knew that few would be stirring
about the city

  when we reached home we greeted lua
and dismissed the girls arranging that they
were to come back again that evening-
fifty of them this time-to carry the
larger platform we were to build we then
had breakfast and after telling lua the
result of the meeting-at which she was
greatly pleased-we went immediately to
bed for we were worn out

  it was about noon i suppose when we
awoke mercer and i spent the afternoon
building the platform on which to carry
taos men-a framework with fifty han-
dles instead of twenty miela and anina
disappeared for the whole afternoon i did
not know what they were doing at the time
later i found out anina was devoting it to
learning english

  during the evening meal we planned it
all taos men were living in a house near
the edge of the city-the house tao had
occupied before he was banished to the
twilight country it had no other occu-
pants at this time

  we had learned where they kept their
boats in one of the bayous near by and
in it we intended to take them to the sea
where we would meet the girls who would
then fly with them to the twilight coun-
try but we could not figure out how to
capture them without alarming the city
we were sure they were unarmed they
had been carefully searched by the author-

ities when they entered the country but
they were ten to our two

  mercer voiced the problem most emphat-
ically

   ten men in a house he declared
 maybe we can catch them all asleep but
even if they are- how are we going to get
them out thered be a row and we dont
want any noise besides theres always
this confounded daylight here if we tied
them up somebody might see us when we
got outside how do we get them out of
that house without any rumpus and down
to that boat thats what i dont see

   i-do-that said anina suddenly
she had spoken in english and we looked
at her in amazement she lisped the words
in her soft sweet voice haltingly like a
little child then she turned to miela and
poured out a torrent of her native language
mercer stared at her in undisguised admira-
tion

  as miela explained it anina proposed
that she go into taos house alone and
decoy his men down to the boat where we
could capture them

   but how will she get them there i
exclaimed  what will she tell them

   she says she can make them think she
is one of those few of our women who
sympathize with their cause miela ex-
plained  and she will say that the earth-
man who escaped from them she has seen
lurking about their boat perhaps he plans
to steal it she will go there with them
and they can recapture him

   they might not all go said mercer
 we want to get them all

   it is aninas thought that they will all
go for they fear this earth-man much-
and all would go to make sure of him

  i could not feel it was right for us to
let anina do so daring a thing and mercer
agreed with me heartily but anina insist-
ed with a fire in her eyes and flushed cheeks
that contrasted strangely with her usually
gentle demeanor

  in the end mercer and i gave in for
we could think of no better plan and
miela was confident anina would not be
harmed

  it was about what would correspond with
ten oclock in the evening on earth when

the girls began to arrive we waited until
all fifty of them had come in miela
named a place on the shore of the sea
known to them all they were to take the
platform-starting in about two hours
when the city would be quiet-and there
they would wait for us to join them in the
boat

  we four started out together but soon
anina left us to make her way to taos
house alone mercer miela and i then
hurried as fast as we could through the
city down to the marshlands and to the
secluded spot on the bayous bank where
the boat was lying

  the bayou here was about a hundred
feet wide a winding brackish stream lined
on both sides with trees whose roots were
in the water and whose branches at times
nearly met overhead its banks were a
tangled mass of tree roots huge ferns pal-
mettos and some tall upstanding kind of
water grass half submerged logs jutted
out into the sluggish current making it in
places seem almost impassable

  a narrow metal boat-a very long and
very narrow motor boat with a thatched
shelter like a small cabin over part of its
length-lay fastened to a tree near at hand
i noticed at once some mechanism over its
stern

  we had come up quietly to make sure no
one was about now we hid ourselves close
to the boat and waited with apprehension
in our hearts for the arrival of anina with
taos men

  half an hour perhaps went by the
silence in this secluded spot hung heavy
about us a fish broke the glassy surface
of the water a lizard scurried along the
ground a bird flitted past then setting
our hearts pounding came the soft snap-
ping of underbrush that we knew was the
cautious tread of some one approaching i
was half reclining under a fallen tree with
a clump of palmettos about me i parted
their fronds carefully before my face a
few yards away a man was standing mo-
tionless staring past me and apparently
listening intently

  he moved forward after a moment i
feared he was coming almost upon us but
he turned aside bending low down as he
the fire people



crept slowly forward sounds in the under-
brush reached me now from other direc-
tions and i knew that the men had spread
apart and were stalking the boat expecting
mercer to be in or near it

  had they all come down here i won-
dered and where was anina i looked
down at miela warningly as i felt her move
slightly

   well wait till theyre all near the boat
i whispered to mercer

  i saw anina a moment later soaring over
the bayou just above the treetops i sighed
with relief for it was a signal to us that
everything was all right we continued to
wait until the men had all come into view
they went at the boat with a sudden rush
several of them climbed into it with shouts
to the others

  with a significant glance to mercer i
leaped suddenly to my feet i was perhaps
twenty feet from the boat and the space
between us was fairly clear a single
bound landed me beside it almost among
four of the men who were standing there
in a group before they had time to face
me i was upon them

  i scattered them like nine-pins and two
of them went down under my blows the
other two flung themselves upon me i
stumbled over some inequality of the
ground and we all three fell prone this
was the first time i had come actually to
hand grips with any of the mercutians

  i felt now not only their lack of strength
but a curious frailness about their bodies-
a seeming absence of solidity that their
stocky appearance belied these two men
were like half-grown boys in my hands i
was back on my feet in a moment leaving
one of them lying motionless the other
rose to his knees his face white with pain
and terror

  i left him there and looked about me
miela was fluttering around near by as i
had instructed her-just off the ground and
with the whole scene under her eyes it
was she on whom i depended for warning
should any of the quarry attempt to es-
cape us

  at the edge of the water another man
was lying whom i assumed mercer had
felled there was a great commotion from

the boat i ran toward it a man was
standing beside it-an old man with snow-
white hair he stood still seeming con-
fused and in doubt what to do as i
neared him he turned clumsily to avoid
me i passed him by and bounded over
the boats gunwale landing in its bottom
the first thing i saw was mercer struggling
to his feet with four of the mercutians
hanging on him one had a grip on his
throat from behind another clutched him
about the knees

  the two others let go of him when they
heard me land in the boat one had evi-
dently had enough for he dived overboard
the other waited warily for my onslaught
as i got within reach i hit at his face
but my blow went wild he hit me full in
the chest but it was the blow of a child

  at that instant i heard mercer give a
choking cry and out of the corner of my
eye saw him go down again i could waste
no more time upon this single antagonist
the man had his hands at my throat now
i seized him about the waist and carried
him to the gunwale he clung to me as a
rat might cling to a terrier but i shook him
off and dumped him in the water

  i turned to mercer just as he was strug-
gling to his feet again and in a moment
more between us we had felled his two as-
sailants mercers face was very white and
i saw blood streaming from a wound on his
head but he grinned as he faced me

   have we-got em-all he gasped
he dashed the blood away from his eyes
with the flat of his hand  i fell-damn
it-right at the start and hit my head
where are they all have we got em
miela alighted in the boat beside us

   two are running she said  they
are together hasten

  we jumped out of the boat miela flew
up and we followed her guidance through
the dense woods we could make much
better speed i knew than the mercutians
 well get them all ollie i shouted at
mercer  theyre not far ahead see up
there-mielas evidently over them now
we came up to them after a few hundred
yards it was the old man and one of
those whom i had first encountered they
did not wait for us to attack them but

stopped stock still flinging their arms wide
in token of surrender

  miela came down among us and we
went back to where we had lain hidden in
the palmettos there we had left a num-
ber of short lengths of rope while we
were tying the arms of these two prisoners
behind them and fettering their ankles so
they could not run anina joined us

   two-in water she cried and then
added something to miela

   two were in the water now they are
in the woods running anina will show
you

  miela stood guard in the boat over our
first two prisoners while mercer and i
rounded up the others it was half an
hour or more before we had them all trussed
up but none of the ten escaped we were
a long time reviving two of those we had
injured but finally we had them all lying or
sitting in the boat

  mercers head had stopped bleeding he
washed it and i found his injury no more
than an ugly scalp wound

   i fell and cut it on something he
explained lugubriously  couldnt see for
the blood inmy eyes but we got em
didnt we

  under mielas direction mercer and i
shoved the boat out into the stream i
need not go into details regarding the pro-
pelling mechanism of this craft miela ex-
plained it hastily to me as we got under
way it used a form of the light-ray from
a sort of strange battery the intense heat
of the ray generated a great pressure of
superheated steam in a thick metal cylinder
underneath the keel

  this steam escaped through a nozzle un-
der water at the stern of the boat and its
thrust against the water propelled the boat
forward the boat was constructed to draw
very little water and when going fast its
bow planed upward until only the stern
of the hull touched the surface it was
steered by a rudder not much different from
some of those types we are familiar with
on earth when we got out into open water
i found the boat was capable of great speed
this i attributed not so much to the effi-
cacy of its propelling force as to the light-
ness of the boat itself it was built of

some metal that i may perhaps compare
with aluminium only this was far stronger
and lighter the boat was in fact a mere
shell extraordinarily buoyant

  miela sat in the stern steering and op-
erating the mechanism i sat with her
mercer was farther forward beside anina
talking to her earnestly our prisoners lay
huddled in various attitudes-frightened all
of them and obviously in no condition to
give us further trouble they were i saw
now not ruffians by any means but rather
men of superior intelligence selected by
tao evidently as those best fitted for
spreading his propaganda among the people
of the great city

  we made slow progress down the bayou
some of its turns were so sharp and so
overhung with trees and obstructed by fall-
en logs we could hardly get through dur-
ing the latter part of the trip the bayou
broadened rapidly dividing into many
channels like a delta

  we came out into the open sea finally-
a broad empty expanse -with a mirrorlike
surface the curvature of the planet was
even more apparent now it seemed almost
as though the water should be sliding back
downhill over the horizon

  we turned to the left as we came out of
the delta and for the first time miela put
the boat to the limit of its speed the
best comparison i can make i think to
this rapid noiseless smooth progress is
that of sailing on an iceboat

  we sped along some five or ten miles
keeping close inland i saw some of the
small thatched shacks along here though
not many for a while the shore re-
mained that same palm-lined half-inun-
dated marshland then gradually it began
to change and we came upon a broad beach
of white sand

  we landed here and found the girls with
the platform waiting for us miela took
anina and one or two of the older girls
aside and gave them last instructions

   what do i do-just dump them on the
other shore mercer asked me

   thats about it i dont know the lay
of the land over there anina does you
do what she tells you

   you bet i will he agreed enthusias-
the fire people



tically some kid-that little girl we
get along fine she understands everything
i say to her already ill have her talking
english like a streak by the time you see
her again

  we had removed the cords from our pris-
oners ankles i motioned them to get out
of the boat we crowded taos men on the
platform they were surprised and some
of them alarmed when they saw how we
proposed to transport them over the water
miela silenced their protests and soon we
had them all seated on the platform with
mercer at the rear end facing them

  the fifty girls grasped the platform han-
dles another moment and they were in the
air with mercer waving good-by to us
vigorously

  miela and i left alone watched them
silently as they dwindled to a speck in the
haze of the sky

  we were about to start back when we
saw a girl coming toward us flying low
over the water one of those we had di-
rected to patrol the coast miela said when
she came closer she saw us and came
down on the beach

  the two girls spoke together hurriedly

  taos men in the water city have
caused great disturbance alan miela said
to me

   wheres th water city

  near the great city-across the
marshlands wre must get back and when
anina and our friend ollie have returned
we must go to the water city it is very
bad there she said

  our trip back to the great city was
without unusual incident we followed
the main route at the best speed we could
make

   we shall tell our king of course about
this disturbance- said miela  perhaps
he will think there is something he can do
but i fear greatly that unless he appeals
directly to the people and they arc with
him-

   hes an old man i said  and all his
councilors are old theyre not fit to rule
at such a time as this suppose he were
to die-what would happen who would
be king then

   a little prince there is-a mere child

and there is our queen-a younger woman
only married to our king these few years
his first queen died

  i questioned miela concerning her gov-
ernment it was i soon learned an au-
tocracy in theory but of later years the
kings advanced age and his equally old
councilors whom he refused to change had
resulted in a vacillating policy of adminis-
tration which now i could see plainly left
the government little or no real power

  only by constantly pandering to the
wishes of the people could the king hold his
throne the supreme command was held
by the king and his aged councilors at
stated intervals the more prominent men of
each city met and enacted laws the cities
were each ruled by a governor in similar
fashion paying tribute to the central gov-
ernment somewhat after our old feudal sys-
tem but for practical purposes they acted
as separate nations they were united
merely by the bonds of their common need
of defense against the twilight people and
of intermarriage which was frequent since
the virgins flying about often found mates
in cities other than their own

  there were courts in each citj not much
more than rude tribunals and jails in which
the offenders were held the police i have
already mentioned they like the kings
guards were inclined in an emergency to
do not so much what they were ordered
as what they thought the people wished

  it was all very extraordinary but like
many another makeshift government it
served after a fashion

  hiding the boat in another bayou we
took our way home on foot that is to
say i ran and miela followed me alter-
nately flying and walking we made our
best speed this way and very soon were
back at home in the great city

  we crossed the garden and entered the
front door expecting to find lua in the
living room but she was not there the
house was quiet

   she would wait up she told me miela
said and raising her voice called her
mothers name

  there was no answer although now i
remember i thought i heard a footfall up-
stairs

  we went up to luas room hurriedly it
was empty and our loud cries of anxiety
throughout the house evoked no response
we entered our own bedroom and before
i could make a move to defend myself i
was seized tightly by both elbows from
behind

  at the same instant an arm hooked
around my neck under my chin and jerked
my head backward and another pair of
arms clutched me around the knees i
struggled vainly to free myself shouting to
miela to run

  but there were too many holding me a
moment more and my arms were tied be-
hind me and a rope was about my legs i
was pushed into a chair and as i sat down
i saw miela standing quietly near by with
two mercutians holding her by the arms and
shoulders

  the man who had pushed me to the seat
bent down and struck me across the cheek
with the flat of his hand his grinning
malevolent face was only a few inches from
mine i saw that it was baar

chapter xviii

revolution

there seemed to be five of our cap-
tors all of them as evil-looking men
as i think i have ever seen they
rummaged about the room evidently in
search for weapons they thought i might
have secreted then they ordered me to
stand up and without more ado led miela
and me from the house

  this was once when i was glad of the
interminable daylight i hoped we might
find some early risers about the streets for
i thought certainly the time of sleep must
now be nearly over but no one was in
sight as we left the garden we turned
the first corner and headed toward the base
of the mountain

  to baars house they are taking us i
think it is on the marshland below
miela spoke without fear of our captors
understanding the english words we took
advantage of this until after a moment we
were roughly ordered to be quiet

  lua we thought must have been taken

away before we arrived we would find her
at baars house when we arrived there we
had come down to the level marshlands
now the outskirts of the city and were
passing along a path between occasional
shacks before us standing alone in a rice
paddy i saw a larger more pretentious
house-a wooden structure on stilts with
a thatched roof which miela said was
where baar lived

  we went in single file up its board in-
cline and entered a squalid room with mat-
ting on the floor a rude charcoal brazier
at one side and the remains of a previous
meal lying on a table

  two women were in the room as we
entered i took these to be baars wife and
a servant two naked little children lay
on the floor one of them crying lustily

  baar glanced around as he came in and
with what i took to be an oath ordered
the children removed from the room the
slave woman-i could see she was a slave
by the band upon her arm-picked them
up evidently she did not move fast enough
to suit baars temper for as she straight-
ened up the man cuffed her upon the head
she stumbled to one side against baars
wife who was standing there and the other
woman with a sharp imprecation struck
her full in the breast

  neither of them saw the look she gave
as she shuffled away carrying the infants
but i did it was a look of the most in-
tense hatred born and nourished i realized
by long ill-treatment

  miela and i were now bound securely
hand and foot and mielas wings were
lashed to her body thus rendered entire-
ly helpless we were laid together in a
corner

  from the talk that followed miela gath-
ered that baar and his men were expecting
the arrival of others he roughly ordered
his wife-a woman of the twilight coun-
try obviously-to clear away the remains
of their last meal and bring other food she
obeyed submissively

  this the first of the twilight country
people i had seen was a thick-set woman of
perhaps thirty-five although she might have
been older for her black hair which fell
in an unkempt mass to her waist was be-
ginning to gray she wore a single gar-
ment a pair of silken trousers drab with
tlirt her clipped wings were covered in the
usual way

  i could see now why miela had said
these twilight women could not fly for
this womans torso was fat and flabby her
skin was curiously pale-a dead unpleasant
white her face was broad heavy and un-
intelligent her eyes were large and pro-
truded slightly

  baar and his men ate breakfast paying
no further attention to miela and me sud-
denly miela spoke in a frightened whisper
 they are going now in a moment to the
castle the king they will kill

  it was evidently a widespread plot we
now overheard baars followers had for
some time been talking quietly with the
lower classes and finding they could count
on their support planned now to murder
the king then with the queen and the
little prince held as hostages they expected
that the men of science threatened also
with a revolt of the peons would release the
light-ray

  the light-ray once in his control baar
could make himself king it seemed an ab-
surd hope but such was the plan they were
now discussing and what was far worse
i could see no way by which i could prevent
the attempt

   they are going to the castle-now-to
murder the king i whispered incredu-
lous

   yes miela answered  so they plan
now-in a moment-before the time of
sleep is over

   isnt he guarded can they get in the
castle without arousing others

   there are the guards-a few but baar
has promised them great wealth and they
will stand aside and let him pass so it is
arranged

  the arrival of several other men inter-
rupted our whispered conversation baar
his meal over consulted with them hurried-
ly he then instructed his wife to watch
us and after a moment they all left the
house

  the woman who was now the only oc-
cupant of the room with us shuffled about
clearing away the meal i tried desper-



ately to work my hands loose i even tried
with my teeth to gnaw mielas bonds but
without success every moment counted
if we were to do anything to save the king
i wondered again where lua was-perhaps
in another part of the house here bound as
we were

   miela i whispered  ask for food
tell her we have had nothing for many
hours perhaps she will loosen our bonds
a little to let us eat we may be able to do
something then

  the woman answered mielas pleading
by setting us up side by side with our backs
against the wall she placed food before us
and then with a knife cut the cords that
bound our arms

  my heart leaped exultantly but instead
of leaving us and going on with her work
she sat down just out of reach holding the
knife in her hand and watching us nar-
rowly

   we must eat miela i said using as
casual a tone as i could and pointing to
the food smilingly  eat and pretend not
to notice her perhaps i can get to my
feet

  we ate the food she had given us i
tensed the muscles of my legs and believed
that bound as i was i might be able to
leap forward and reach the woman it was
almost hopeless to attempt it for i realized
she would meet my body with the dagger
point

  we were still eating and i was thinking
over this plan when the slave woman ap-
peared silently in a doorway across the
room behind the woman who faced us
something in her attitude made me look
away again casually and go on with my
eating

  miela had evidently not noticed her

  the slave woman came slowly toward us
a moment later she hurled herself upon
baars wife from behind at the same in-
stant i threw myself forward falling prone
but within reach of the seated woman i
gripped her with my hands fumbling to
catch her wrists but before i could suc-
ceed she toppled forward and fell partly
over me

  i heard miela give a cry of fright i
struggled free and raised myself up to a

half-sitting position baars wife lay be-
side me dead with the slave womans knife
buried to the hilt in her back

  reaching over i took the knife from the
dead womans fingers and with it cut the
cords that bound my ankles i sprang to
my feet the slave had retreated and stood
shrinking against the side of the room ter-
rified at what she had done i paid no more
attention to her for the moment but has-
tened to release miela

  we searched the house hurriedly calling
to lua but she did not answer nor could
we find her when we returned the slave
woman was still standing where we had left
her staring with horrified eyes at the body
of her mistress

   tell her what she did was right i said
 she may have saved the king tell her
to go to your house and wait for us

  the woman nodded eagerly when miela
told her what to do and fell on her knees
before us

  she says she will serve us always she
has been very badly treated alan

  we sent the woman away and with a
last hasty glance around hurriedly left the
house alone with its single dead occupant
a large wooden mortar and pestle used for
pounding rice stood in the kitchen i car-
ried the pestle away with me it was nearly
five feet long and quite heavy-an excel-
lent weapon

  we hastened up through the city-miela
half walking half flying and i carrying this
bludgeon and running with twelve-foot
strides but it was now hardly more than
three-quarters of an hour since we had
passed this way before and there were still
few people about to see us baar and his
men had started some twenty minutes be-
fore us i figured and we must reach the
castle before them

  i made extraordinary progress over the
level country but i could not run uphill
for long and soon had to slow down to a
walk miela kept closer to me now we
approached the castle grounds

   where will the guards be miela we
must avoid them if we can they might
try to stop us

  miela did not know where they would
be but under the circumstances as baar

had told his men she believed the
guards would disappear from the vicinity
this conjecture proved to be correct the
guards not wishing to be concerned in the
affair at all had simply disappeared we
saw nothing of baar and his men on the
way up the mountain although i had hoped
we might overtake them

  as we passed hurriedly through the palm
gardens surrounding the castle i saw its
huge front doors were closed

   miela we cant get in that way a
side entrance-or some other way-

   i know she said  there is a smaller
door below and others on the side

  we hastened on suddenly i gripped
miela by the arm

   whats that-over there-see beyond
the grove

  there seemed to be furtive figures lurking
among the palms

   those cannot be baars men miela-
there are too many what can it-

  we had reached a little doorway under
the front terrace there was no time to
investigate these advancing figures baar
and his men might already be inside the
castle

  i slid through the doorway every muscle
tense miela had brought the knife from
baars shack and with it clenched in her
hand was close beside me i wanted to
make her stay outside where she could fly
away if danger threatened but she pleaded
to follow me and i let her come i needed
her since i had no idea of the interior ar-
rangements of the building

  we passed along a dim hallway and up
a narrow flight of stone steps not a sound
came to us the interior of the castle was
silent as a tomb at the top of the steps
we came almost directly into the inner patio
of the building across a bed of tall flow-
ers nodding gently in a little morning
breeze that swept down from above i saw
the head and shoulders of a man standing
in the center of the courtyard the lower
part of his body was hidden by the flowers
i tried to duck out of sight but he had
seen me

  he was not over forty feet away i
stepped back believing i could reach him
in a single leap but miela held me
the fire people



   not you alan he would cry out
the noise would bring others she raised
her knife and her eyes blazed into mine
never have i thought to kill a human
but now i-a woman-must kill stand
quiet alan

  she flew swiftly up and poised over the
man he had started toward us evi-
dently he was so far as anxious for si-
lence as we for he made no sound i saw
now he was one of those who had come
to baars shack his naked shoulders his
thick neck and bullet head were all that
showed above the flower stems as he plowed
his way through them directly toward me
but the hand he swung aloft to aid his
progress held a knife

  he glanced up at miela poised in the
air above him and saw the weapon in her
hand at this new enemy he stopped con-
fused

  miela swooped down at him and he
struck at her with his knife but she
avoided it with an incredibly swift turn
and a second later had passed him and was
crossing the courtyard

  round and round she flew her great
wings flapping audibly a giant bird circling
its prey the man turned continually to
face her several times she swooped toward
him and as swiftly avoided his blow from
every side she threatened the man stood
now bewildered striking wild in a frenzy
as one strikes at a darting wasp at last
with an agonized cry he turned and ran
instantly she dropped upon him there
was a flash of her white arm the mans
body crumpled and lay still among the
flowers

  miela was back beside me her breast
was heaving her eyes were full of tears
she trembled

   a terrible thing alan my husband for
a woman to do but it had to be

  i pressed her hand with silent under-
standing

   come alan she said  they will
have heard his cry the others-we must
meet them too

   we must get to the king i-

  a vibrant scream rang out from the si-
lence of the house-a mans voice shrill
with agony-then suddenly stilled

   good god miela the king-where
is he take me there

  she pulled me back through the door-
way a man scurried past i leaped at
him and struck him a glancing blow with
the heavy wooden pestle he stumbled to
his knees without thought of giving
quarter i hit him again before he could
rise he sank back senseless or dead

  miela was ahead of me and i ran after
her along a hallway the sound of scurry-
ing footsteps sounded from overhead a
woman screamed

  a broad curving stairway fronted us i
passed miela halfway up and reaching the
top ran full into another man who darted
from a doorway close by the impact of
my heavier body flung him backward to
the floor i leaped over him with a shout
of warning to miela and ran on into the
room

  a man was standing stock still in its cen-
ter it was baar he flung his knife at
me as i appeared but it went wild two
other men were coming toward me from
opposite sides of the room i swung the
bludgeon about me viciously keeping them
away suddenly baar shouted a command
and before i could reach any one of them
they had scurried away like rats

  a low bed with a huge canopy of silk
stood against the wall a woman knelt on
the floor beside it and against her knees
huddled a little half-grown boy

  i heard mielas voice shouting in her own
language the sound of men running came
from below then mielas half-hysterical
laughter and then the words

   they are running away alan-all of
them i have been calling you to bring
me the light-ray and they are running
away

  i turned to the bed pushing its curtains
aside and then hurriedly closing them again
with a shudder

  miela was beside me

   the king is dead miela no-you
must not look

  her eyes widened her hand went to her
breast

   there is one who needs you i point-
ed to the woman on the floor

  she was staring at us unseeing one arm


argosy-allstory weekly

flung about the child protectingly holding
him partially under one of her long sleek
red wings the fingers of her other hand
clutched convulsively at the bed coverings
she was moaning softly with a grief and
terror all the more intense because it was
restrained

   there is one who needs you miela
i repeated  comfort her-for we have
come too late

  the castle now was in thorough confu-
sion several waiting maids rushed into
the room stared at their mistress and the
little prince and seeing what had hap-
pened stood silently wringing their hands
in fright or fled aimlessly through the halls
one of the kings councilors had come in
stopping bewildered at the scene that met
him

   tell him what has occurred miela i
said

  there came now faintly to my ears from
outside the castle sounds of a gathering
crowd-murmurs and vague muffled shouts
the cries grew louder a rain of missiles
struck the castle a stone came through a
near-by window falling almost at my feet
all at once i remembered the lurking figures
we had seen among the palms in the gar
den

   miela i cried  hear that outside
a crowd is gathering the men we saw-
out there people whom baar has--
miela ask him for gods sake to tell us
how we can get weapons where are the
other councilors send for them we
must do something-now at once this
is revolution miela-dont you under-
stand  revolution 

  i felt so impotent here in this crisis
i could talk to no one but miela-could
issue no direct commands-could under-
stand the words of no one but her

  suddenly from over our heads a great
solemn deep-throated bell began tolling

   what is that what does that mean

  a girl rushed into the room

   it is the bell of danger said miela
quickly  the girls are ringing it to arouse
the city up here then will the people
hurry to find out what it is that threat-
ens -

   theyre outside now i retorted  or-
der all the kings councilors here at once
find out if any guards are about the place
send them here where is the head of the
citys police send him here to me tell
him to call out all his men

  what was i saying i had forgotten the
one vital thing

   miela the light-ray these men of
science who guard it where are they send
for their leader get him here to me at
once-we must have the ray

  miela stood very quietly beside me her
face was white her eyes blazed but she
seemed calm and unfrightened

   he will come she said  and armed
with the ray the bell will bring him
your other commands i will see are
obeyed

  the old councilor who had been stand-
ing by dazed came slowly forward t
mielas call the kings councilor and
all the others were like him the king was
dead and here was the little prince hud-
dled in his mothers arm realization had
been slow in coming but now it broke upon
me like a great light

  i flung the bludgeon away from me and
stood erect

   miela i cried  tell him-tell them
all-their king is dead it is i who com-
mand now there is no one else-and i
have the power tell them that it is i
the man from earth who commands

pacity of bond salesman for gunning  co
there he discovered that his physical con-
dition counted for much and the same abil-
ity that had served him so well in college
counted for more and he forged ahead so
rapidly that mr gunning called him into
his private office and complimented him

  this meant a great deal mr gunning
was not among the lesser powers in the
street indeed men said the market ate
out of mr gunnings hand and when things
slid out from under and the lambs were
caught by their pretty pink toes it was
whispered around that old man gunning
had raked in a couple of country estates a
few private yachts and a fleet or so of motor
cars	o

   that day sam had walked from the office
touching the floor only about once in every
three strides and then he fell into real hap-
piness and real trouble all at the same in-
stant coming toward him was the most
radiant creature in the world she was
talking and laughing with dried-up old
peters the head bookkeeper sam had in-
stantly loathed peters and then loved him
because the next moment he was being in-
troduced to constance gunning sam held
her hand for a long time and remembered all
the lonesome years of his life and marveled
greatly that he had been able to live through
them

   apparently constances thoughts were in
perfect unison with his for she never did
reach her fathers office instead she went
down to the street with sam where she let
him buy her a soda and told him that she
liked men with gray eyes

   their friendship was as swift as a ten-
inch shell-and as deadly two days later
sam explained to constance that he loved
her as no other girl had ever been loved
constance said that she had known it all
the time and kissed him and let him slip a
ring with a very small diamond on her
finger-and then the trouble began to make
itself apparent

   mr gunning had laid careful plans re-
garding his daughters future but the possi-
bility of her becoming the wife of one of
his own bond salesmen figured in none of
them sam was called into the private
office for his second interview and mr gun-

 ning pointed these things out to him the
 interview ended by mr gunning requesting
 sam never to show his face inside the fifth
 avenue house again denied him the use of
 the telephone and the united states mail
 and fired hitoji telling him to  get to hell
 out and stay out 

   sam had gone directly to a telephone and
 a half hour later he and constance were
 having tea in a little tea shop on fortieth
 street she had tried to induce him to go
 with her to the city hall so they could get
 a marriage license without further delay

   with the picture of mr gunning still
vivid in his mind sam had demurred and
raised so many objections that constance
had accused him of not loving her

   i do love you sam had answered
gloomily  but the trouble is that your
father doesnt love me

   thats perfectly stupid constance
had exclaimed  because you are not mar-
rying my father you are marrying me-at
least you said you wanted to marry me-
maybe-

    if you look like that again sam bad
 interrupted  im going to kiss you and
 horrify the waitress

   so they didnt reach any decision but
went to a movie instead and sat in the gal-
lery because the seats were cheaper than
in the orchestra the picture was a  so-
ciety drama in which the thirty-five-year-
old heroine with curls to her waist refused
to sell herself for gold but married her
fathers chauffeur instead constance felt
very much cheered up and held sams hand
when the lights went out for the next pic-
ture

    you see she had whispered  thats
 the way its going to be with us were go-
 ing to live happily ever afterward

    it listens well sam had muttered un-
 convinced  only that chap turned out to
 be a prince in disguise and if im a prince
 my retainers and subjects have forgotten to
 mention the fact

   then constance had made herself quite
clear by saying that if sam didnt get up
enough nerve to marry her she would marry
some one else out of spite sam had pleaded
for a month in which to make a fortune so
he could give her something near to what
anonymous



she had been accustomed and constance
had reluctantly consented

  now as he stood looking sourly at the
coffee pot and waiting for it to boil over
he remembered only too well that his time
of probation was up by something like six-
teen hours it was up to him and up to
him dam soon or she would carry out her
threat

  his rooms were in a remodeled building
on twelfth street and after breakfasting
with the photograph propped up against
the sugar bowl he walked down the stairs to
find the postman sticking some letters into
the little brass boxes at the left of the door
the united states mail service was being
maintained for the express purpose of car-
rying letters from constance to himself so
he ran down the last few steps and peered
into his box as the postman went out of the
door

  ah as expected he could see the let-
ter through the little glass door he fum-
bled with a key reached inside and to his
dismay drew out a somewhat rumpled pos-
tal card addressed to him in lead pencil
turning it over and moving to the light he
made out the following inscription

  buy m q oil sell at twenty-four

  huh sam muttered  why m q
oil

  he turned the postal over and once more
inspected the address there was no clew
to the sender but he decided that a woman
had written it and probably an old wo-
man because the writing was more or less
irregular and cramped

   now who the deuce- he began and
again dropped his perplexed gaze to the
card it had been posted down town for it
bore the imprint of the hudson terminal
station but that was a large order and it
told him nothing

   now who the deuce- he repeated
and got no further

  somehow though he could not tell why
he vaguely associated the card with a wo-
man he had bumped into the day before
he had been crossing church street under
the sixth avenue elevated tracks and had
attempted to get out of an old ladys way
as she scampered across the street in that

instant a truck had appeared out of no-
where sam lifted her out of danger and
when he got her to the sidewalk she had
expressed her gratitude in disconnected

gasps

   oh thats all right he had laughed

 glad i could help

  now as he stood in the hall looking
through the little panes of glass beside the
door he tried to recall her more clearly he
distincdy remembered that she had worn
a bonnet tied under her chin with black
ribbons and her eyes he decided were sort
of  soulful-looking eyes

   thats ridiculous he exclaimed aloud
shoving the card into his coat pocket and
opening the door  perfectly absurd she
doesnt know me from-didnt even ask my
name besides what in the world would
that old lady know about m q oil fool-
ishness-forget it

  but he didnt forget it he reached the
corner of sixth avenue bought a paper
and the first thing he looked for was the
stock quotations m q oil the night be-
fore had closed at twelve and an eighth
probably it hadnt moved far away from the
figure for the past six months sam laughed
scornfully and tore the postal into little
pieces as he walked down to the station at
eighth street

  there were two or three places sam had
made up his mind to get in if he could and
one of them wras borden  borden brokers
joe borden the son had roomed across
the hall at new haven

  sam turned out of broad street into a
building and an elevator whisked him up
to an office where a lot of men were sitting
in armchairs before a big blackboard on
which a boy was changing little cards that
he took from a belt around his avaist

  sam didnt see joe at first so he found
a seat at the back of the room and fell to a
study of the board he knew it by heart
already and was on familiar terms with
most of the offerings while he watched
the boy advance steel an eighth and then
a quarter and then walking to the other
end of the board he stuck a new card
under m q oil for those who had that
particular stock for sale the little numbers
proclaimed that they could find buyers and


argosy-allstory weekly

those buyers were willing to pay fourteen
dollars a share

  sam blinked and drew himself to a
straighter position in the chair

   two points he muttered  this
morning now he added excitedly
 what does that mean

  he began wishing that he had been a
little less hasty in destroying the postal he
was not sure if it had said twenty-two or
twenty-six or twenty-four

    it said twenty-four he decided at last
and gave so much attention to the board
that joe borden entered the customers
room hung his hat and coat in a comer and
went on into an inner office without sam
seeing him

  during the next half hour the rise in m
q was very slow but it was as steady as
an eight-day clock an eighth a quarter
another eighth another quarter sam wet
his lips and began to figure on how much
money in a pinch he could raise his
bank book showed something less than five
hundred dollars he had a very nice set of
pearl cuff links and the electric stove not to
mention the silver frame around constances
picture but aside from these very few
things his possessions were unpawnable

   at the same time five hundred dollars or
even four hundred dollars would buy a cer-
tain number of shares on a margin of
course and with a ten point rise at this
point sam started out of his chair only
to sink back with a look of determination
crossing his features

  ever since the day he first entered wall
street he had taken a solemn vow never to
play the market he had bought some few
shares outright and held them for a profit
but never never on a margin this-well
this was a totally different matter how
in the face of the good sam hill did the
person who wrote that card know that m q
oil was going up and if he had known
why had he told him

  he felt in his pocket for his check book
and-shook his head

   u its only a little flurry he reasoned to
himself  a twelve-point rise no not
with me im going somewhere and get
some lunch and by the time i come back
shell be down to rock bottom again

  sam reached the street and headed for
the buffet iunch at that moment he heard

an excited voice calling his name and
wheeling he found himself lacing con-
stance who was waving to him from her
fathers limousine

   come on get in she exclaimed when
he approached her eyes were sparkling
with all the fun the photograph had prom-
ised  fathers just gone up to the office
so he wont want the car all day ve can
drive out into westchester and pick flowers
hurry he may look out of the window
sam glanced apprehensively at the build-
ing which sheltered mr gunning and
brought his eyes back to the grinning face
of the chauffeur

   you dont care how i die do you he
asked turning to the girl  dont you like
me any more

   dont be silly she scolded  hurry
isnt this luck i came down because i had
a hunch that id see you get in do
hurry 

  he hastened to obey and she turned to
him with a frown as he settled himself on
the cushion  i suppose she observed
icily  that you know your month is up
what are you going to do about it

  instead of answering he took her hand
and the chauffeur turned around in time to
catch them

   oh drive anywhere constance ex-
claimed  out in the country quite far
out

  they came back to town very late in
the afternoon and the chauffeur on his way
down to pick up mr gunning-who very
much disgusted had gone home in the sub-
way-dropped them at vicarss where they
had tea with some friends so it was still
later when sam took constance home in a
taxi and helped her out in front of the
fifth avenue house he was careful to hop
back into the cab again with the least pos-
sible delay

   you will do something to-morrow wont
you she pleaded pausing on the sidewalk
and looking back at him  please 

  when constance said  please  in that
tone of voice and gazed at sam through
half-closed eyes he always felt a mad de-
sire to shout aloud he remembered in

                          	a
anonymous



  time that he was in front of mr gunnings
residence and restrained the impulse con-
tenting himself with leaning toward her

through the cab door

  dont you ever dare do that again i
he threatened  because i refuse to be
responsible for my actions

  she pouted and if anything constances
pout was more charming than her  please
 take me away driver sam gasped
in sudden panic go beat it

  after taking most of sams money the
driver when he reached forty-second
street dismissed his passenger and sam
wandered over to broadway and entered the
back room of a place where they once sold
very famous beer

  he ate in abstracted attention his mind
still filled with constances pout until a
newsboy came in with a sporting extra
mechanically he dropped three cents into
the boys hand and opened the paper at
the financial page

  m q oil had closed at thirteen and a
half but-and sam gulped as he read the
figures-the highest point it had touched
during the day was twenty-six

  sam scowled darkly at the back of a
mans head just in front of him as though
the stranger was responsible for that sudden
flurry in oil he was figuring how much
he had not won and it made his head ache
and he caught himself wishing there was a
law against writing anonymous postal cards
but above these thoughts as one ray of
hope like a flash lamp in a cellar he was
utterly and entirely thankful that he had
not told constance about the postal

   yes he nodded gravely  she would
have broken it off and broken it off so
sudden that i wouldnt ever have been able
to catch my breath 

  the paper said that some one had been
trading very heavily in m q and went on
to give a dozen rumors that had been cur-
rent in financial circles for the activity in
the stock

  in complete dejection he paid his check
and by way of the seventh avenue surface
car took himself back to his room before
he went to hed he covered a dozen sheets
of paper with figures by his calculations
he and constance should have been on their
 a

way to the maine woods where they would
camp out for their honeymoon

  dressing the following morning was a
slower process than usual he told con-
stances picture all about the trouble but
she only smiled back at him with so much
understanding that he felt better put on his
hat and went downstairs to find another
postal in the brass mail box holding it
between shaking fingers he read

   buy southern copper sell at seventy-five

  my word he breathed gazing in
alarm at his reflections in the glass door
 i wonder if this thing is a sort of black
hand affair theyll come around and
blackmail me for my profits or blow me
up

  he remembered having seen southern
copper quoted somewhere around fifty-five
the day before and if it went to seventy-
five and he had four hundred dollars worth
on a margin-he bolted from the house and
almost ran to the corner where he snatched
up a paper to reassure himself that his mem-
ory was not at fault

  southern copper had been offered at
fifty-five and an eighth and had found
takers at fifty-five sam ducked into a
drug store and after finding borden  bor-
dens number in the book entered a tele-
phone both

  his scruples were still very lively he
didnt in the least want to buy southern
copper on a margin but there was con-
stances ultimatum to be considered  with
a twenty-point rise and four hun-

  his musings were cut short for a voice
answered the call and sam wanted to know
if joe borden had arrived at the office
yes mr borden was there and a moment
later sams four hundred dollars belonged to
some one else

  this made him feel very comfortable dur-
ing the walk down to the elevated until he
suddenly remembered that the postal might
be wrong and that instead of advancing
twenty points southern copper might drop
off an equal amount he would be swept
as clean as a new broom could sweep him
there was nothing cheerful about this so
he was quite miserable during the ride
down town

  when he at last reached the customers
room of borden  bordens office he was
met almost before he set foot inside the
doorway by joe who greeted him with a
howl of delight

   whered you pick up that tip he
wanted to know  and why didnt you tell
me it was a sure thing

   sure sam faltered looking wildly at
the blackboard

   your stop order saved you joe ex-
plained  she touched seventy-six went
up like a rocket and dropped like a buck-
shot if you get hold of anything else
like that and you dont tell me-but why
didnt you buy more

  sam walked heavily to a chair and sat
down  i will he muttered  next time
he went down to the street again and
against orders telephoned constance

   well she asked as she recognized his
voice  your month-

   i want to see you he exclaimed  i
want to-

   mothers coming she gasped excited-
ly  meet me to-morrow at vicarss i
have to go to aunt marthas-

  a clap of thunder ended the sentence
and sam knew that constance had been in-
terrupted he hung the receiver back on
the hook and left the booth secretly con-
signing aunt martha to a life sentence in
siberia

  to-morrow-why to-morrow was twenty-
four hours away the world might come to
an end before to-morrow and besides she
hadnt said what time to-morrow he start-
ed back into the telephone booth but
thought better of it and issued out into
broad street instead where he stood on the
pavement and gloomily watched the crowd
until he turned at last toward the subway
and made his way uptown to vicarss

  he dined in solitary state and tried to im-
agine that constance was sitting across the
table from him it was a dreary day and
before it was over he hated himself and the
world and everything in it

  that night he lay awake for hours specu-
lating on the chances of finding another pos-
tal he had gone over every possible solu-
tion of the mystery only to confess that he
was no nearer the answer wtien he thought

of the cards he always thought of the old
lady in the bonnet but as this was totally
out of all reason he forced it out of his
mind and began all over at the beginning

  he beat the alarm clock by half an hour
the following morning and was downstairs
fifteen minutes before the postman put in
an appearance sam told himself that he
was crazy to expect a card a sane man
would have breakfasted comfortably and
comfortably started out to look for a job
and then the postman who didnt know sam
from a black cat stuck the card in the box
and sam snatched it out again

  it told him in the same scrawled pen-
ciled words to buy union motors and to
sell again after an eleven-point gain

  he telephoned the order frop the drug
store and went down town to borden 
bordens office where joe buttonholed him
and pumped him dry which was easily
done because sam truthfully said that he
didnt know anything about it

  joe was frankly skeptical about union
motors he said he didnt think sam had
a chance of making anything this piece
of news depressed sam so much that he for-
got to call constance on the telephone until
nearly two oclock when he found that she
had left the house also he failed to locate
her at vicarss so he went back to the cus-
tomers room and watched his stock creep
slowly up the eleven-point gain which the
postal had predicted add a few points ap-
parently for luck and begin to fall off as
slowly as it had gained

   you won yesterday too didnt you
joe asked curiously as he met sam walking
toward the door after he had sold his hold-
ings in union motors  whos putting you
up to this come on sam let me in on it

   i told you i didnt know sam re-
peated

  it was not an answer to inspire credulity
and joe snorted in utter disgust  hey
he called over his shoulder  will you tell
me if you get any more

   yes sam nodded  but i wont get
any more

  he spent the evening trying to get in
touch with constance until the butler final-
ly out of patience told sam that constance
had gone away  if hit  do you hany
good sir he added with a touch of malice the orchestra in the hope that he might

 hi dont think as shes cornin back ham
more whereupon he rang off and sam

cursed him to the most remote generation

that he could think of

the following morning sam received an-
other postal and vrhile he read it held the

bit of pasteboard as though it were a live
snake

  this was the message that he read 

   buy consolidated electric it will go to

   twenty-six

 the- dont care how fast i get rich

he murmured to himself placing the card
tenderly in his pocket he took his way to
the elevated

  upon reaching the brokers office he
dragged his friend into a corner and whis-
pered a few short words into his ear

   now he finished  dont for
heavens sake blame me if the confounded
thing goes down 

  consolidated electric joe exclaimed
in alarm  you dont mean to tell me you
are going to buy that not at this time 

   if not sooner sam nodded  stick
around and watch

  he had shaken off his fear of losing
those postals were coming from some one
or something with inside information of a
kind not to be lightly disregarded the
writing was the same still small and
cramped scrawled with the stub of a pencil
sam didnt know why he felt that it was
the stub of a pencil but his mind was very
dear on this point and another thing he
was sure of the old lad with the bonnet
was writing the cards

  consolidated electric increased sams
fortune to such proportions that he was be-
ginning not to care how much more he
made with what he already had he and
constance could laugh at mr gunning
and do t to his face but constance was
not to be found when he called her house
a disagreeable mans voice informed him
that miss constance had gone away and
that be was under orders not to disclose
her address

  sam groaned in an agony of spirit and
went to the theater where he sat all by him-
self in a stage box and stared morosely at

catch sight of the girl he loved

  in a short week-the arrival of the pos-
tals had been as regular as the sun-he
reached a point where it bored him to think

of borden  borden he felt that if he

was called upon to look at another stock

quotation he would buy out the stock mar-
ket and dump it into the east river and
then the papers got bold of the thing

  a reporter cornered him in the custom-
ers room and forced him to disclose the
story of his life while sam wasnt look-
ing a photographer snapped his picture

   but how much have you made the
reporter asked not without a touch of envy

   i dont know sam answered  i
havent had time to count it up

  the reporter made a note of this and
signaling to the photographer departed to
do his worst with the power of the press

  this when it was helped out by some
genius of the copy desk was quite sufficient
and sam beheld the smudged picture of
himself over the following caption

  samuel hilton the boy financial king oi
  wall street who has won an enormous for-
  tune during the past two weeks by his almost
  uncanny stock transactions

  above the picture and spread across
three columns big black type announced to
sam that he was fighting wall street to a
standstill and that he was too busy to count
up his profits

   thats nice that is sam exdaimed
hotly  now whoever it is thats sending
me those cards will know all about it i
may as well expect to be bombed to-night
he was about to throw away the paper
when his eye fdl on another headline stuck
inconspicuously down in one corner of the
sheet it read as follows

clairvoyant routs judge

woman tells judjfe braids inside history

  sam had the paper again in his hands
and was perusing a short account of a
woman giving her name as mrs james
murry of east new york who had set
the court room in an uproar when she
claimed to receive a message from her spirit
guide who so mrs mum- said informed


argosy-allstory weekly

her that judge braid had dined the evening
before with a young lady who was not his
wife then followed this report

    mrs murry is an elderly lady rather
  motherly-looking and save for her somewhat
  soulful-looking eyes is not the type of the
  usual clairvoyant from under the brim of
  her old-fashioned bonnet tied with ribbons
  under her chin she gazed at the judge in all
  seriousness as she delivered her  message
  judge braid sputtered in confusion but
  whether her  information  was correct he
  did not say

     it is alleged that mrs murry has been prac-
   ticing her trade of clairvoyant in the down
   town district where she has been purport-
   ing to give information and  messages  per-
   taining to the movements of the stock market
   she will be held for general sessions without
   bail

   my word sam grunted and over the
top of the paper he stared out of the win-
dow with startled eyes  purporting  he
broke out in derision  i rather think she
has been  purporting 

  he knew that it was up to him to do
something but what of course there was
no shadow of proof that the old lady whom
he had saved from the truck and mrs
murry were one and the same person and
this much he allowed quite cheerfully but
then he turned right around and decided
that he had better get her a lawyer

  sam told himself that he owed her this
much and that it was only decent that he
should pay his debt with this idea in
mind he searched out joe borden and told
him that he had immediate use for a lawr-
yer whom could he recommend

   john woods joe returned without
hesitation  but hell stick you an awful
bill

   thats the man sam answered
 write his address on this card

  sam reached the door opened it and
stood face to face with constance gunning

  why-why he gasped well-
where have you been

   father took me out to aunt marthas
and made her promise to keep me there i
ran away at d came back as soon as i could
and they told me id find you over here
and is it true she gasped for breath
 the money i mean

  true he laughed but come on

ill tell you about it were going first to
a jail where im going to try to see a friend
of mine then were going to a lawyers and
after that were going to buy a car and go
to some state where they dont ask you to
wait an unheard number of days-after
you get a license-before you can get mar-
ried

   is it as much as that she asked as
they reached the street

   as what

   the money youve made

   its more he assured her  its not
only enough for me to marry you but its
enough to support you

   a short time later with a ten-dollar bill
showing conspicuously between his fingers
sam interviewed an official who was not at
all in favor of sams plan he caught sight
of the money at this moment and led sam
through a series of halls and doors until he
came to a cell in which a woman was sit-
ting on a chair apparently perfectly con-
tented with her surroundings

  mrs murry was large tall raw-boned
gawky and awkward in a daze sam
glanced about the cell and his eyes lit on a
black bonnet with brilliant red cherries
fastened about the brim

   take me away he breathed to the
official  ive seen enough and all ive
got to say is that i have a fine opinion of
that newspaper mans imagination and his
idea of an old-fashioned bonnet

  the official led the way back to where
they had left constance

   we dont have to go to the lawyers
sam explained when they reached the
street  it was a mistake he turned
to the driver and gave the address of the
building on twelfth street  ill pick up
a bag he said as the car rolled away
 then well stop for your things and after
that well only hit the high spots till we get
to a state that looks awfully good to you
 but i want to know why we visited the
jail constance demanded

  ask me anything but that sam
groaned u because if i answered you it
wouldnt be the truth and if i told you
the truth you wouldnt marry me

   sam

   i mean im only weak from the chin
anonymous



up he explained  i havent committed
any crime the fact of the matter is
that i havent enough sense to commit a

crime

  sam left her still pouting while he ducked
into the house and produced a grip full of
clothes with these they started uptown
and stopped in front of her home on fifth
avenue

  sam hopped out helped constance to
the sidewalk and was on the point of hop-
ping back in again when his eye fell upon
mr gunning walking serenely down the

steps

  a malicious grin was on the mans face
and sam stood still in his tracks with his
heart doing some queer things in his breast
mr gunning advanced held out his hand
and-unless sam had taken leave of his
senses-smiled

   thats great work youve been doing
down town he began  compliment you
on it sorry you thought it necessary to
leave our house hope to see you back
again some day i didnt know you were
acquainted with my daughter how is that
constance

   you didnt know sam repeated find-
ing a strange difficulty in breathing  you
didnt-

   you didnt- constance began staring
in amazement  you-

   coming in mr gunning asked ap-
parently he had overlooked sams grip

  we were- sam gulped  we
were-

   going for a ride thomas constance
finished

   beautiful day mr gunning remarked
 stop in on your way back and have din-
ner with us ive got something id like to
talk over with you

  thank - thank you sam faltered
and he helped constance back into the
taxi

   i guess this belongs to you mr gun-
ning said  its a note some one left at the

office

  sam was unable to speak he simply
stared as mr gunning turned back toward

the steps

  when they were speeding through the
park sam turned to the girl and stared at

her

   i think i know she said after a mo-
ment it was mother i told her that
i was going to run away with you and i
said that if i did i never expected to set
foot in their house again i was mighty
serious it scared them dont you see and
fathers relented and probably he was able
to fix it up with mother because youve
made all this money just think sam
now i can have a wedding-what was the
note

  he raised the bit of paper and glanced
at it then choked back a cry of amazement
it was a post card and in the same scrawled
writing his mysterious friend had given him
a parting message

    you are welcome  constance read
aloud  what does he mean by that

   he sam retorted  it isnt a he its
a she

   she-he-what do you mean con-
stance exclaimed

   i mean a woman wrote this post card

  she screamed in derision  a woman
that writing why id know it at the
north pole

   youd know it he breathed  then
whos-then-

  why its fathers she exclaimed
 whose did you suppose it was

that as one favored in the princes eyes he

   so traveling with the almost incessant
swift progress which was an art with all
decoits in a few days they arrived at raj

chapter xix

the afghan

dewan sewlal had warned hunsa
and sookdee against their natural
proclivities for making a decoitv
while traveling to the pindari camp as the
mission was more important than loot-an
enterprise that might cause them to be
killed or arrested indeed the gulab had
made this a condition or her going with
them she was practically put in com-
mand both xana sahib and the dewan
were pleased over what they deemed her
sensible acquiescence in the scheme as
has been said the dewan recognizing the
debased ferocity of hunsa had promised
him the torture when he returned if bootea
had any cause of complaint

by w a fraser

author of  the three sapphires thoroughbreds  etc
caste



men women and children-higher up in

the hills

  as had been planned some of the decoits

had come as recruits to the pindari stand-
ard this created no suspicion because
free-lance soldiers adventurous spirits
from all over india flocked to a force that
was known to be massed for the purpose of
loot it was an easy service little dis-
cipline a regular moslem fighting horde
holding little in reverence but the daily
prayer and the trim of a spear or the edge
of a sword amir khan was the law the
army regulation the one thing to obey as
to the matter of prayers for those who were
not followers of the prophet who carried
no little prayer carpet to kneel upon face
to mecca there was it being a rajput
town the always shrine of shiva and his
elephant-headed son ganesh to receive
obeisance from the hindus and those who
had come as players wrestlers were wel-
comed joyously for there being no imme-
diate matter of a raid and throat-cutting
and little of disciplinary duties time hung
heavy on the hands of these grown-up
children

  hunsa was remembered by several of
the pindaris as having ridden with them
before and he also had suffered an apos-
tasy of faith for he now swore by the
beard of the prophet and turned out at
the call of the muezzin and testified to the
fact that there was but one god-allah

  and he had known his amir khan well
when he had told the dewan that the fierce
pindari was gentle enough when it came to
a matter of feminine beauty for bootea
made an impression

  of course it would have taken a more
obdurate male than amir khan not to ap-
preciate the exquisite charm of the gulab
no art could have equaled the inherent pa-
trician simplicity and sweetness of her
every thought and action perhaps her de-
termination to ingratiate herself into the
good graces of the chief was intensified
brought to a finer perfection by the motive
that had really instigated her to accept
this terrible mission her love for the eng-
lishman barlow

  of course this was not an unusual thing
few women have lived who are not capable

of such a sacrifice for some one the
 grand passion  when it comes and rarely
out of reasoning smothers everything in
the heart of almost every woman - once
it had come to bootea foolishly impos-
sible of attainment everything against its
ultimate accomplished happiness but noth-
ing of that mattered she was there wait-
ing-waiting for the service that fate had
whispered into her being

  and she danced divinely-that is the
proper word for it her dancing was a
revelation to amir khan who had seen
noutchnis go through their sensuous sug-
gestive voluptuous twistings of supple
forms disfigured by excessive decoration-
bangles anklets nose rings high-colored
swirling robes and with voices worn to a
rasping timbre that shrilled rather than
sang the ghazal love song as they gy-
rated but here was something different
booteas art was the art that was taught
princesses in the palaces of the rajput
rajahs not the bidding of a courtesan for
the desire of a man her dress was a float-
ing cloud of gauzy muslin and her sole evi-
dent adornment the ruby-headed gold
snake-bracelet the iron band of widow-
hood being concealed higher on her arm
some intuition had taught the girl that this
mode would give rise in the warriors heart
to a feeling of respectful liking it had al-
ways been that way with real men where
she was concerned

  when amir khan passed an order that
bootea was to be treated as a queen his
officers smiled in their heavy black beards
and whispered that his two wives would yet
be hand-maidens to a third the favorite

  hunsa saw all this for he was the one
that often carried a message to the gulab
that her presence was desired in the palace
but there were always others there the
players and musicians-those who played
the guitar and the violin-and the officers

  hunsa was getting impatient every
time he looked at the handsome black-
bearded head of the warrior he was like a
covetous thief gazing upon a diamond neck-
lace that is almost within his grasp he
had come there to kill him and delay was
dangerous he had been warned by the
dewan that they suspected barlow meant


argosy-allstory weekly

to visit the chief on behalf of the british
he might turn up any day when he spoke
to bootea about her part in the mission
the enticing of amir khan to her tent so
that he might be killed she answered

   hunsa you will wait until i give you
a command to kill the chief if you do not
it is very likely that you will be the sacri-
fice for he is not one to be driven she
vowed that if he broke this injunction she
would denounce him to amir khan she
would have done so at first but for the idea
that treachery to her people could not be
justified but by dire necessity

  every day the gulab as she walked
through the crowded street scanned the
faces of men afoot and on horseback look-
ing for one clothed as a patan but in his
eyes the something she would know the
something that would say he was the deified
one and she had told amir khan that
there was a patan coming with a message
for him and that when such an one asked
for audience that he should say nothing
but see that he was admitted

  then one day-it was about two weeks
of waiting-captain barlow came he was
rather surprised at the readiness with which
he was admitted for an audience with the
chief it was in the audience hall that he
was received and the chief was surrounded
as he sat on the rajahs dais by officers

  barlow had come as ayub alii an af-
ghan and as it was a private interview he
desired he made the visit a formal one
the paying of respects with the usual pre-
senting of the hilt of his sword for the chief
to touch with the tips of his fingers in the
way of accepting his respects

  the chief knowing this was the one
bootea had spoken of wrote on a slip of
yellow paper something in persian and ten-
dered it to barlow saying  this will be
your passport when you would speak with
me if there is in your heart something to
be said

  going barlow saw that he had written
but the one word

jm 

  this when translated into english in-
terpreted one word  afghan

  hunsa too had watched for the coming
of barlow the same whisper that had
come to booteas ears that he would ride
as a patan had been told him by the de-
wan knowing that when barlow arrived
he would endeavor to see the chief in his
quarters hunsa daily hovered hear the
palace and chatted with the guard at the
gates the heavy double teak wood gates on
one side of which was painted on a white
stone wall a war elephant and the other
side a rajput horseman his spear held at
the charge this was the allegorical repre-
sentation so general all over mewar of
rana pertab charging a mogul prince
mounted on an elephant

  thus hunsa had seen the tall patan and
heard him make the request for an audience
with amir khan it was the walk the
slight military precision that caused the
decoit to mutter  xo hill afghan that

  and when barlow had come forth the
bagree trailed him up through the chowk
and just as the man he followed came to
the end of the narrow crowded way hunsa
saw bootea coming from the opposite di-
rection suddenly stop and her eyes go
wide as they were fixed on the face of the
tall patan

   it is the accursed sahib hunsa
snarled between his grinding teeth he
brooded over the advent of the messenger
and racked his animal brain for some
scheme to accomplish his mission of mur-
der and counteract the others influence
and presently a bit of rare deviltry crept
into his mind joint partner with the mur-
der thought if he could but kill the chief
and have the blame of it cast upon the
sahib who no doubt would have his in-
terviews with amir khan alone

  during the time hunsa had been there
several times in the palace somewhat of a
privileged character known to be connected
with the gulab he had familiarized him-
self with the plan of the marble building-
the stairways that ran down to the central
court the many tortuous passages the
marble fretwork screen niches and myste-
rious chambers

  either hunsa or sookdee was now al-
ways trailing barlow-his every move was
known and then as if some evil jinni
caste



had taken a spirit hand in the guidance of

events hunsas chance came barlow who

had tried three times to see amir khan
one day received a message at the gate that
he was to come back that evening when
the chief having said his prayers would
give him a private audience

  hunsa had seen barlow making his way
from the serai where he camped with his
horse toward the palace and hurrying with
the swift celerity of a jungle creature he
reached the gate first his head wrapped
in the folds of a turban so that his ugly
face was all but hidden he was talking to
the guard when barlow gave the latter his
yellow slip of passport and as the guard
left his post and entered the dim entrance
to call up the stairway for one to usher in
the afghan hunsa slipped nonchalantly
through the gate and stood in the deep
shadow of a jutting wall his black body
and drab loin-cloth merging into the gloom

chapter xx

 thou art a man

 t s the one alone amir khan asked
i when a servant had presented bar-
lows yellow slip of paper

 but for the orderly that is with him

   tell him to enter and go where your
ears will remain safe upon your head

  the bearer withdrew and captain bar-
low entered preceded by the orderly who
with a deep salaam announced

   sultan amir khan it is ayub alii who
would have audience then he stepped
to one side and stood erect against the
wall

   salaam chief barlow said with a
sweep of a hand to his forehead and amir
khan from his seat in a black ebony chair
inlaid with pearl shell and garnets re-
turned the salutation asking and what
favor would ayub alii ask

   a petition such as your servant would
make is but for the ears of amir khan
the black eyes of the pindari deep set
under the shaggy eyebrows hung upon
the speakers face with the fierce watchful
stab of a falcons

  barlow saw the distrust the suspicion

he unslung from his waist his heavy pistol

took the tulwar from the wide brass-
studded belt about his waist and tendered
them to the orderly saying  it is a mes-
sage of peace but also it is alone for the
ears of amir khan

  the pindari spoke to the orderly  go
thou and wait below

  when he had disappeared the pindari
rose from the ebony wood chair stretched
his tall giant form and laughed  thou
art a seemly man ayub alii but thinkest
thou that amir khan would have fear thou
sendest thy playthings by the orderly

   no chief it was but proper and you
will know that the message is such that
none other may hear it

   sit on yonder divan afghan and tell
this large thing that is in thy mind

  as barlow took a seat upon the divan
covered by a red and green bokharan rug
lifting his eyes suddenly he was conscious
of a mocking smile on the pindaris lips
and the fierce black eyes were watching his
every move as he slipped a well-strapped
sandal from a foot rising he stepped to
the table at one end of which the pindari
sat and placing the sandal upon it said

 if the chief will slit the double sole with
his knife he will find within that which i
have brought

   the matter of which you spake af-
ghan is a service and amir khan is not
one to perform a service of the hands for
any one

   but if i asked for the chiefs knife not
having one-

   lnshall-a but thou art right if thou
hadst asked for the knife thou mightst have
received it and not in the sandal he
laughed the laugh welled up from his
throat through the heavy black beard like
the bubble of a bison bull

  the pindari reached for the sandal and
as he slit at the leather thread he com-
mented thou hast the subtlety of a
true patan within i take it is something
of value and if it were in a pocket of thy
jacket or a fold at thy waist those who
might seek it with one slit of their dis-
coverer which is a piece of broken glass
carrying an edge such as no blade would
have would take it up but a mans san-

dais well strapped on are removed but af-
ter he is dead

    bismiuahl the pindari had the pa-
per spread flat upon the black table and
saw the seal of the british raj he seemed
to ponder over the document as if the writ-
ing were not within his interpretation then
he said  we men of the sword have not
given much thought to the pen employing
scribblers for that purpose but to-morrow
a mullah will make this all plain

   barlow interrupted the chief  shall i
read the written word

    what would it avail hereon is the
seal of the englay raj but as you read the
thumb of the raj would not be upon your
lip in the way of a seal the mullah will
interpret this to me is it of an alliance
 it is chief

  the pindari laughed  holkar would
give me a camel load of gold rupees for this
and thy head sindhia might add a pro-
vince for the same

   true chief and has amir khan
heard a whisper of reward and a dress of
honor from sindhias dewan for his head
 afghan there is always a reward for
the head of amir khan but a gift is of
little value to a man who has lost his life
in the trying without are guards ready to
run a sword through even a shadow and
here i could kill three

   he raised his black eyes and scanned the
form of ayub alii there was a quizzical
smile on his lips as he said

    go back and sit thee upon the divan
when barlow had taken his place the
chief laughed aloud saying  well done
captain sahib thou art perfect as a patan
even to the manner of sitting down one
would have thought that except for a
saddle thou hadst always sat upon thy
heels

   barlow smiled good humoredly saying

 it is even so i am captain barlow and
this -he tapped the loose baggy trousers
of the afghan hillman and the sheepskin
coat with the wool inside- was not in
the way of deceit but for protection on the
road

    it is well thought of the pindari de-
 clared  for a sahib traveling alone through
 rajasthan would be robbed by a mahratta

or killed by a rajput but as to the de-
ceiving of amir khan dost thou suppose
that he given to a patan the paper of ad-
mittance or of passing such as he gave to
thee even at the audience i was pleased
with thy manner of disguise

   barlow was startled  did you know
then that i was a sahib-how did you
know

    because thou wert placed in my hand

in the way of protection

   then barlow surmised that of all out-
side his own caste there could be but one
and he knew that she was in the camp for
he had seen her  it was a woman

    a rare woman even i chief of the pin-
daris-and we are not bred to softness-
say that she is a pearl

    they call her the gulab barlow ven-
tured

   she is well named the gulab the
perfume of her is in my nostrils though it
mixes ill with the camel smell without
offense to allah i can retain her for it is in
the koran that a man may have four wives
and i have but two

    but the gulab is of a different faith
barlow objected and a chill hung over his
heart

   the pindari laughed  the sahibs have
agents for the changing of faith those who
wear the black coat of honor and a mullah
will soon make a good musselmani of the
beautiful little infidel of course sahib
there is the other way of having a mans
desire which is the way of all pindaris-
they consider women as fair loot when the
sword is the passport through a land but
as to the gulab the flower is most too fair
for a crushing in such a matter as i
have spoken of the fragrance is gone and
a man when he crushes the weak has con-
flict with himself

    its a topping old barbarian this leader
of cutthroats barlow admitted to him-
self but in his mind was a horror of the
fate meant for the girl and somehow it
was a sacrifice for him he knew an en-
largement of the love that had shown in
the soft brown eyes as he listened schemes
of stealing the gulab away of saving her
were hurtling through his brain

    and mark thee sahib amir khan has
caste



found favor with the little flower for when
i thought of an audience with her in her

own tent-for to be a leader of men in

possession of two wives and holding strong
by the faith of mahomet it is as well to be
circumspect-the gulab warned me that a
knife might be presented as i slept a jeal-
ous lover perhaps i think-it would not
have been ayub alii by any chance
what barlow was thinking was  a
most subtle animal this and he now un-
derstood why the pindari as if he had for-
gotten the message was talking of the gu-
lab as an oriental he was coming to
the point in circles

   it was not chief barlow answered
 a british officer on matters of state would
break his honor if he trifled with women

   put thy hand upon thy beard afghan
-though thou hast not one-and swear by
it that it was not thee the woman meant
when she spoke of a knife for i like thee
barlow put his hand to his chin  i
swear that there was nothing of evil intent
against amir khan in my heart he said
 and that is the same as our oath for it
is but one god that we both worship

  the chief again let float from his big
throat his low deep musical laugh

   an oath is an oath nothing more to
trust to it and go to sleep in its guardian-
ship one may never wake up even the
gods cannot bind a heart that is black with
words it was one of my own name who
swore on the shrine of eklinga at udaipur
friendship for a prince of marwar and
changed turbans with him which is more
binding than eating opium together then
slew him like a dog of my faith an oath
by the beard of the prophet is more bind-
ing i think too many gods such as the
men of hind have produce a wavering
but thou hast sworn to the truth as i am
a witness the delay of an audience was
that thou mightst be well watched before
much had been said for a child at play
hides nothing and if thou hadst gone but
once to the tent of the gulab amir khan
would have known

   but as to this -his hand tapped the
document- it has been said that the brit-
ish raj doles out the lives of its servants as
one doles grain in a time of famine if an

envoy such as a rajah sends in a way of

pride came with this and were made a
matter of sacrifice perhaps twenty lives
would have paid of the trying but as it is

but one is the account

  barlow shot a quick searching look into
the pindaris eyes was it a covert threat
but he answered  it is even so it was
spoken of as a matter for two but-
the chief laughed  i know sahib
thou art pleasing to me of the sahibs i
have little knowledge but i have heard it
said they were a race of white rajputs save
that they did not kill a brother or a father
for the love of killing what service want
they of amir khan

   there are rumors that the mahrattas
forgetting the lessons they have received-
both holkar and sindhia having been
thoroughly beaten by the british-are se-
cretly preparing for war

   a jontr a last death rush is it not

   they will be smashed forever and
their lands taken

   but the king of oudh has been prom-
ised a return to glory to join in this revolt
the fighting rajputs-what of them
backed by the english they should hold
these accursed black mahrattas in check
barlow rose and the wary eyes of the
chief on every move stepped over to the
table and pointed to a signature upon the
document

   that he said  is the signature of the
rana of mewar meaning that he also
passes the salt of friendship to amir
khan

  he turned the document over and there
written upon it were the figures  

   bismillajt the chief cried for he had
not noticed this before  it is the tilac
the ranas sealing of the document it is the
mystic number that means that the con-
tents are sacred that the curse of the sack
of fort chitor be upon him who violates
the seal it is the oath of all rajputs-tilac
that which is forbidden and the sahibs
have heard a rumor that amir khan ifts
a hundred thousand horsemen to cut in
with even sindhia is afraid of me and
desires my head the sahibs have heard
and desire my friendship

   that is true chief


argosy-allstory weekly

    this is the right way and the pin-
dari brought his palm down upon the gov-
ernment message  i have heard men say
that the english were like children in the
matter of knowing nothing but the speaking
of truth i have heard some laugh at this
accounting it easy to circumvent an enemy
when one has knowledge of all his inten-
tions but truth is strength we have faith
in children because they have not yet
learned the art of a lie in two days cap-
tain sahib thou wilt be called to an audi-
ence he rose from his chair and with a
hand to his forhead said  salaam sahib
may the protection of allah be upon you

    salaam chief barlow answered and
he held out a hand with a boyish frankness
that caused the pindari to grasp it and
the two stood two men looking into each
others eyes

    go thou nowr sahib thou art a man
go alone and with quiet for i would view
this message and put it in yonder strongbox
before others enter

chapter xxi

the ghoul

when captain barlow had gone
amir khan took up the message
and read it once he chuckled
for it was in his oriental mind that the
deceiving of barlow as to his knowledge of
writing was rather a joke once as he read
the heavy silk purdah of the door swayed a
little at one side as if a draft of wind
had shifted it and an evil face appeared
in the opening

   presently he rose from his chair took
the lamp in one hand and the paper in the
other and crossed to the iron box in a far
corner of the room he set the flickering
light upon the floor and dropping to his
knees drew from his waist band a silver
chain at the end of which were his seal
and keys his broad shoulders blanked
tfie tiny cone of light and behind through
a marble fretwork a delicate tracery of
lotus flowers that screened the window
trickled cold shafts of moonlight that fell
upon something evil that wriggled across
the white and black slabs of marble from

beneath the door curtain the moonlight
glistened the bronze skin of the silent
crawling thing that was a huge snake or a
giant centipede it was even like a square-
snouted shovel-headed mugger that had
crept up out of the slimy river that circled
sluggishly the eastern wall of the palace

   once as amir khan fitted a key in the
lock he checked and knelt as silent as pas-
sive as a bronze buddha listening and
the creeping thing was but a blur a shadow
without movement silent then he raised
the lid of the box and paused holding it
with his right hand the flickering light
upon his bronze face showing a smile as his
eyes dwelt lovingly upon the gold and
jewels within

   and again the thing crept or glided not
even a slipping purr noiseless just a drift-
ing shadow only where a ribbon of moon-
light from between a lotus and a leaf picked
it out was the brown thing of evil marked
against the marble then the divan blurred
it from sight from behind the divan to
the ebony chair and the wide black-topped
table the shadow drifted and when amir
khan had clanged the iron lid closed and
risen lamp in hand there was nothing to
catch his eye

   he placed the lamp that was fashioned
like a lotus upon the table and dropping
into his chair yawned sleepily then be
raised his voice to call his bearer

   abd-

   the name died on his lips for the brown
thing behind the chair had slipped upward
with the silent undulation of a panther and
a deadly roomal-towel-had flashed over
the chiefs head and was now a strangling
knot about his tawny throat the knuckles
of hunsa were kneading his spine at the
back of the skull with a half twist of the
cloth he was pinioned to the back of the
chair he was in a vise the jaws of which
closed his throat just a stifled gurgle es-
caped from his lips as his hand clutched at
a dagger hilt the muscles of the naked
brown body behind stood out in knobs of
strength and the face of the strangler pan-
reddened teeth showing in the flickering
light as if they had bitten into blood was
the face of a ghoul

   the powerful pindari struggled in smotb-
caste



ering desperation and hunsa twisting the
gorilla hands sought in vain to break the

neck but it wras too strong

  then the chair careened sidewise and
the pindari shot downward his forehead
striking a marble slab stunning him
hunsa with the death grip still on the
roomal planted a knee between the vic-
tims shoulder blades and jerked the head
upward still the spine did not snap and
slowly tightening the pressure of the cloth
he smothered the man beneath his knee till
he felt the muscles go slack and the body
lie limp-dead

  then hunsa crossed the roomal to his
left hand and stretching out his right
grasped the chiefs dagger where he lay
upon the floor and drove it from behind
through his heart he placed the knife
upon the floor where drops of blood trick-
ling from its curved point lay upon the
white marble like spilled rubies he un-
fastened the silver chain that carried the
keys and crossed the floor with the slouch-
ing crouch of a hyena rapidly he opened
the iron box took the paper amir khan
had placed there and hesitated for a sec-
ond his ghoulish eyes gloating over the
jewels and gold but he did not touch them
his animal cunning holding him to the
simple plan that was now working so
smoothly he locked the box and slipped
the key chain about the dead mans waist
then seizing the right hand of his victim
he smeared the thumb in blood and im-
printed it upon the paper just beside the
seal of the british raj muttering  this
will do for nana sahib as wtell as your
head pindari and is much easier hidden

  he placed the paper in a roll of his tur-
ban blew out the flickering light and with
noiseless bare feet glided cautiously to the
door the purdah swung backhand there
was left just the silent room all dark save
for little trickles of silver that dropped
spots and grotesque lines upon the body of
the dead chief it fell full upon the knife
flooding its blade into a fingerlike mirror
and glinted the blood drops as if in reality
they had turned to rubies without the
piirdah hunsa did not crouch and run but
walked swiftly though noiselessly as one
upon a message ten paces of the dim-

lighted hall he turned to the right to a bal-
cony

  here at the top of a narrow winding
stone stairway hunsa listened no sound
came from below and he glided down be-
neath was a balcony corresponding with the
one above and just beyond was a domed
cell that he had investigated it was a cell
that at one time had witnessed the quick
descent of headless bodies to the river be-
low a teakwood beam with a round hole
in the center spanned the cell just above
an opening that had all the appearance of
a well hunsa had investigated this exit
for this very purpose for he had been some-
what of a privileged character about the
palace

  he now unslung from about his waist
hidden by his baggy trousers a strong fine
line of camel hair making one end fast
to the teakwood sill he went down hand
over hand his strong hard palms gripping
the soft line at the end of it he still had
a drop of ten or twelve feet but bracing
his shoulders to one wall and his feet to
the other he let go hunsa was shaken by
his drop of a dozen feet but the soft sand
of the river bed had broken the shock of
his fall he picked himself up and crouch-
ing in the hiding shadow of the bank hur-
ried along for fifty yards then he clam-
bered up cautiously to the waste of white
sand that was studded with the tents of
the pindari horsemen on his right floating
up the hill in terraces its marble white in
the moonlight was the palace where amir
khan lay dead it still held a somber
quietude the murder had not been dis-
covered

  he had mapped this route out carefully
in the day and knew just howt to avoid the
patrolling guards and he was back in the
narrow chcruk of the town that was a strug-
gling stream of swaggering pindaris and
darker skinned marwari bunnias and shop-
keepers hunsa pushed his way through
this motley crowd and continued on to the
gate of the palace

  to the guard who halted him he said
if the other who went up to see the chief
is gone i wtould go now meer sahib as i
have said it is a message from the gulab
begum


argosy-allstory weekly

    i looked for you when i returned from
above the guard answered  but you had
gone the afghan has gone but a little
since-stay you here

   he called within yaeoub

   lt was the orderly who had conducted
barlow to amir khan who answered and
to him the guard said  go to the chiefs
apartment and say that one waits here with
word from the favorite

  hunsa sat down nonchalandy upon a
marble step and drew the guard into a
talk of raids explaining that he had ridden
once upon a time with chitu on his foray
into the territory of the nizam

chapter xxii

they bring the afghan

hunsa had come back to the palace in
haste so that the murder of amir
khan might be discovered soon after
captain barlow had left and that the crime
might be fastened upon the sajrib as he
waited chatting to the guard there was
suddenly a frenzied deep-throated call of
alarm from the upper level of rooms that
was answered by other voices here and
there crying out there was a hurrying
scuffling of feet on the marble stairs and
yacoub appeared his eyes wide in fright
crying

   the chief has been stabbed hes
dead hes murdered guard the door-
let no one out-let no one in

   beat the nakara the guard com-
manded  raise the alarm

   he seized his long-barreled matchlock
blew on the fuse and pointing up toward
the moonlit sky fired just within in a
little court yacoub with heavy drum
stick was pounding from the huge drum
a thunderous vibrant roar ami somebody
at his command had seized a horu and
from its copper throat a strident shriek of
alarm split the air

   the narrow street was now one surging
mass of excited pindaris with their rid-
ing whips they slashed viciously at any one
other than their own soldier caste that ven-
tured near driving them out crying

 this is alone for the pindaris 

   a powerful whiskered jamadar pushed
bis way through the mob throwing men to
the right and left with sweeps of his strong
arm and reaching the guard was told that
amir khan lay up in his room murdered
then an hazari commander of five thou-
sand came running and pushed through
the throng that the full force of the tragedy-
held almost silent

  the guard saluted saying  com-
mander kassim the chief has been slain

   how-who

   i know not commander

    who has passed the guard here

   but one the afghan who was ex-
pected by the chief he went forth but
lately

   a patan kassim roared trust a
woman and a snake but not a patan he
turned to the whiskered jamadar  quick
go you with men and bring the afghan
to another he said  command to enter
from there -his hand swept the mob in
front- a dozen trusty sowars and flood
the palace with them up up every room
every nook every place of hiding under
everything and above everything and
through everything search not even let
there be exemption of the seraglio-mur-
der lurks close to women at all times seize
every servant that is within and bind him
let none escape

  he swept a hand out toward the pin-
daris in the street that were like a pack of
wolves  up the hill-surround the pal-
ace and guard every window and rat-
run

  the guard saluted venturing  com-
mander none could have entered from out-
side to do the foul deed

    liar lazy sleeper he smashed with
his foot the hookah that sat on the marble
floor its long stem coiled like a snake
 while you busied over such and opium
one has slipped by

  he reached out a powerful hand and
seized the shoulder of a pindari and jerked
him to the step commanding  stay here
with this monkey of the tall trees and see
that none pass t go to the chief when
the afghan comes have him brought up
hunsa had stood among the pindaris
shoved hither and thither as they surged
caste



back and forth once the flat of a txdivar
had smote him across the back but when
he turned his face to the striker who recog-
nized him as a man of privilege one of
the amusers he was allowed to remain

  the startling cry  the chief has been
murdered the sultan is dead  swept out
over the desert sand that lay white in the
moonlight and the night air droned with
the hum of fifty thousand voices that was
like the song of a world full of bees and
the night palpitated with the beat of horses
feet upon the hard sand and against the
stony ford of the parched river as the pin-
dari horsemen swept to rajgar as if they
rode in the sack of a city

  hoarse full-throated cries calling the
curse of allah upon the murderer were like
a deep-voiced hymn of hate-it was con-
tinuous

  the bunnias and the oilmen and the
keepers of cookshops hid their wares and
crept into dark places to hide the flicker-
ing oil lamps were blotted out but some
of the pindaris had fastened torches to their
long spears and the fluttering lights waved
and circled like shooting stars

  rajgar was a sheol it wras as if from the
teak forests and the jungles of wild mango
had rushed its full holding of tigers and
leopards and elephants and screaming
monkeys

  soon a wedge of cavalry a dozen wild-
eyed horsemen pushed their way through
the struggling mob at their head the jama-
dar bellowing  make way-make the
road clean of your bodies

  they bring the afghan somebody
cried and pointed to where barlow sat
strapped to the saddle of his beluchi mare

   it is the one who killed the chief an-
other yelped and the cries rippled along
from mouth to mouth tulwars flashed in
the light of the lurid torches as they swept
upward at the end of long arms threaten-
ingly but the jamadar roared  back
back youre like jackals snapping and
snarling back if the one is killed how
shall we know the truth

  one an old man yelled triumphantly
 allah be praised a wisdom-a wisdom
the torture the horse-bucket and the hot
ashes the jamadar will have the truth

out of the afghan allah be praised it
is a wisdom

  at the gate straps were loosed and bar-
low was jerked to the marble steps as if he
had been a blanket stripped from the
horses back

   it is the one jamadar the guard de-
clared thrusting his face into barknvs

 it is the afghan beyond doubt there
will be blood upon his clothes-look to it
jamadar

   we found the afghan in the serai and
he was attending to his horse as if about
to fly beyond doubt he is the murderer
of our chief one who had ridden with the
jamadar said

   bring the murderer face to face with
his foul deed the jamadar commanded
and clasped by both arms pinioned bar-
low was pushed through the gate and into
the dim-lighted hall in the scuffle of the
passing hunsa sought to slip through im-
pelled by a devilish fascination to hear all
that would be said in the death chamber
if the case against the sahib were short and
decisive-perhaps they might slice him into
ribbons with their swords-hunsa would
then have nothing to fear and need not
attempt flight

  but the guard swept him back with the
butt of his long smooth bore crying

 dog where go you then he saw that
it was hunsa the messenger of his chiefs
favorite-as he took the gulab to be-and
he said  you cannot enter hunsa it is a
matter for the jamadars alone

  at that instant the gulab slipped
through the struggling groups in the street
the pindaris gallantly making way for her
she had heard of the murder of the chief
and had seen the dragging in of the afghan
through the struggling mob

   let me go up guard she pleaded

   it is a matter for men he objected
 the jamadar would be angry and my
sword and gun wtould be taken away and i
should be put to scrub the legs of horses if
i let you pass

   the jamadar will not be angry she
pleaded  for there is something to be said
which only i have knowledge of it was
spoken to me by the chief he had fear of
this afghan and please in the name of


argosy-allstory weekly

allah let hunsa by for being alone i
have need of him

  the soft dark eyes pleaded stronger than
the girls words and the guard yielded half
reluctantly to the young pindari he said
 go you with these two and if the jamadar
is for cutting off their heads say that those
in the street pulled me from the doorway
and these slipped through  have no fancy
for the compliment of a sword on my neck
in the dim hallway two men stood guard-
ing the door to the chiefs chamber and
when the man who had taken the gulab
explained her mission one of them said
 wait you here i will ask of kassim
his pleasure

  presently the guard returned  the
commander will see the woman but if it
is a matter of trifling let the penalty fall
upon the guard below the mingling of
women in an affair of men is an abomina-
tion in the sight of allah

  when bootea entered the chamber she
gave a gasping cry of horror the chief
lay upon the floor face downward just as
he had dropped when slain for kassim had
said  ajnir khan is dead may allah
take him to his bosom and such things as
we may learn of his death may help us to
avenge our chief touch not the body
her entrance was not more than half ob-
served for kassim at that moment was
questioning the afghan who stood a man
on either side of him and two behind

  he was just answering a question from
the commander and was saying a i left
your chief with the peace of allah upon
both our heads for he gripped my hand in
fellowship and said that we were two men
why should i slay one such who was ver-
itably a soldier who was a follower of
mahomet

  the man who had brought barlow up to
amir khan w-hen he came for the audience
said  commander i left this one the
afghan here with the chief and took with
me his sword and the short gun he had no
weapons

 insjialla it was but a pretense the
commander declared  a pretense to gain
the confidence of the chief for he was slain
with his own knife it was a patan trick
the commander turned to the afghan

 why hadst thou audience with the chief
alone and at night here-what was the

mission

  barlow hesitated a slight hope that
might save his own life would be to de-
clare himself as a sahib and his mission
but he felt sure that the chief had been
murdered because of this very thing that
somebody an agent of nana sahib had
waited hidden had killed the chief and
taken the paper to speak of it would be
to start a rumor that would run across
india that the british had negotiated with
the pindaris and if the paper werent
found there-which it wouldnt be-he
wouldnt be believed better to accept the
roll of the dice as they lay that he had lost
and die as an afghan rather than as an
englishman a spy who had killed their
chief

u speak patan kassim commanded
 thou dwellest overlong upon some he

   there was a mission barlow an-
swered  it was from my own people
the people of sind

   of sindhia

   no from the land of sind afghan-
istan wre ride not with the mahrattas
they are infidels while we be followers of
the true prophet

   thou art a fair speaker afghan and
was there a sealed message

   there was commander sahib

   where is it now

   i know not it was left with amir
khan

  there was a hush of three seconds then
kassim whose eye had searched the room
saw the iron box  this has a bearing
upon matters he declared this affair of
a wtritten message  open the box and see
if it is within he commanded a pindari

   how now woman for the gulab had
stepped forward  what dost thou here-
ah there was talk of a message from the
chief it might be it might be because 
-his leonine face full whiskered the face
of a wild rider a warrior softened as he
looked at the slight figure- our noble
chief had spoken soft words of thee and
passed the order that thou wert begum
that whatsoever thou desired was to be

or the hiding place of the knife of a mur-
derer look ye in his turban

  as the turban was stripped from the
head of hunsa the pindari gave it a whirl-
ing twist that sent its many yards of blue
muslin streaming out like a ribbon and
the parchment message ell to the floor

  ah-ha and a man stooping thrust
it into the hands of the commander

   the pindari who held the turban threw
it almost at the feet of bootea saying
 methinks the slayer will need this no
more

    bootea picked up the blue cloth and
rolled it into a ball saying  if it is per-
mitted i will take this to those who en-
trusted hunsa with this foul mission to
show them that he is dead

    a clever woman thou art-it is a wise
thought take it by all means for indeed
that dogs head will need little when they
have finished with him the soldier agreed

  kassim had taken the written paper
closer to the light at sight of the thumb
bloodstain upon the document he gave a
bellow of rage  look you all  he cried
holding it spread out in the light of the
lamp  here is our chiefs message to us
given after he was dead he sealed it with
his thumb in his own blood after he was
dead a miracle calling for vengeance
hunsa dog thou shalt die for hours-thou
shalt die by inches for it was thee
kassim held the paper at arms length
toward barlow asking  is this the mes-
sage thou brought

    it is commander

  kassim whirled on hunsa  where
didst thou get it dog of an infidel

   without the gate of the palace my
lord i found it lying there where the sahib
dropped it in his flight

    allah thou art a liar of brazenness
he spoke to a jamadar  have brought
the leather nosebag of a horse and hot
ashes so that we may come by the truth
then kassim held the parchment close
to the lamp and scanned it he rubbed a
hand across his wrinkled brow and pon-
dered  beside the seal here is the name
rana bhi and he turned his fierce eyes
on barlow

    yes commander the rana has put his

 seal upon it that he will join his rajputs
 writh the british and the pindaris to drive
 from me war sindhia-the one whose de-
 wan sent hunsa to slay your chief

    thou sayst so but how know i that
hunsa is not in thy hand and that thou
didst not prepare the way for the killing
here beside the name of the rana is drawn
a lance that suggests an order to kill a
secret order he turned to a sepoy  bring
the rajput zalim

   while they waited bootea said  it was
 nana sahib who sent hunsa and the de-
 coits to slay amir khan because he feared
 an alliance between the chief and the
 british

   and thou wert one of them

    i came to warn amir khan and-

    and what woman the decoits were
your own people

    yonder sahib had saved my life-
saved me from the harem of nana sahib
and i came to save his life and your
chiefs

   now there was an eruption into the
chamber men carrying a great pot of hot
ashes and one swinging from his hand the
nosebag of a horse and with them was the
rajput

    here kassim said addressing the
hindu  what means this spear upon this
document is it a hint to drive it home
zalim put his finger reverently upon
the ranas signature  that commander
is the seal the sign i am a chondawat
and belong to the highest of the thirty-six
tribes of mevvar and that sign of the lance
was put upon state documents by chonda
it has been since that time-it is but a seal
even as that-and zalim proudly swung
a long arm toward the wall where a huge
yellow sun embossed on gypsum rested-
 even that is an emblem of the children of
the sun the sesodias of mewar the rana
 it is well kassim declared  as to
this that is in the message to-morrow with
the aid of a mullah we will consider it
and now as to hunsa we would have from
him the truth

   he turned to the gulab  go thou in
peace woman for our dead chief had high
regard for thee and captain sahib even
thou may go to thy abode not thinking to
caste



leave there however without coming to pay
salaams thou wouldst not get far

chapter xxhi

 i will tell what i know

when the two bad gone kassim
clapped his hands together  now
then for the ordeal the search for
truth he declared

  hot wood ashes were poured into the
nosebag and protesting cursing strug-
gling the powerful bagree was dragged to
the center of the room

   who sent thee to murder amir khan
kassim asked

   before bhowanee prince i did not kill
him 

  at a wave of kassims hand upward the
bag of ashes was clapped over the decoits
head and he was pounded on the back to
make him breathe in the deadly dust then
the bag was taken off and gasping reeling
he was commanded to speak the truth
once kassim said  dog this is but gentle
means torches will be bound to thy fingers
and lighted the last thing that will re-
main to thee will be thy tongue for we have
need of that to utter the truth

  three times the nosebag was applied to
hunsa like the black cap over the head of
a condemned murderer and the last time
rolling on the floor in agony his lungs on
fire his throat choked his eyes seared like
hot coals he gasped that he would confess
if his life were spared

   dog kassim snarled thy life is
forfeit but the torture will cease it is re-
ward enough-speak

  but the bagree had the obstinate cour-
age of a bulldog the nerves of his giant
physical structure were scarce more vibrant
than those of a bull as to the torture it
was but a question of a slower death but
his life was something to bargain for half
dead from the choking of his lungs with an
animal cunning he thought of this it was
the one dominant idea in his numbed brain
as he lay his mighty chest pumping its
short staccato gasps commander kassim
said  bring the dog of an infidel water
that he may tell the truth

  when water had been poured down the

bagrees throat he rolled his bloodshot eyes
beseechingly toward the commander and
in a voice scarce beyond a hoarse whisper
said  if you do not kill me prince i will
tell what i know

    tell it dog- then die in peace kassim
snarled

  but hunsa shook his gorilla head and
answered  bhowanee help me i will not
tell if i die i die with my spirit cast at

thy shrine

  kassim stamped his foot in rage and a
jamadar roared  tie the torches to the
infidels fingers we will have the truth
half a dozen ptndaris darted forward
and poised in waiting for the command to
bind to the fingers of the bagree oil-soaked
torches but kassim waved them back
and stood his brow wrinkled in pondering
his black eyes sullenly fixed on the face of
the bagree then he said  what this
dog knows is of more value to our whole
people considering the message that has
been brought than his worthless life that is
but the life of a swine

  he took a turn pacing the marble floor
and with his eyes called a jamadar to one
side  these thugs when they cast them-
selves in the protection of kali die like
fanatics and this one is but an animal tor-
ture will not bring the truth mark you
jamadar i will make the compact with him
do not lead an objection but trust me

   but the dead chief commander-

   yes because of him he loved his peo-
ple and the knowledge that yon dog has
he would not have sacrificed

   but is amir khan to be unavenged
the jamadar queried

    allah will punish yonder infidel for the
killing of one of the true faith go and
summon the officers from below and we will
decide upon this

  soon a dozen officers were in the room
and the sowars were sent away then kas-
sim explained the situation saying  a
confession brought forth by torture is often
a lie the concoction of a mind crazed by
pain if this dog who has more courage
than feeling sees the chance of his life he
will tell us the truth

  but they expostulated saying that if


argosy-allstory weekly

 they let him go free it would be a blot upon
 their name

    the necessity is great kassim de-
 clared  and this i am convinced is the
 only way we may leave this punishment
 to allah for allah is great he will not let
 live one so vile

   finally the others agreed with kassim
 who said that he would take the full onus
 upon himself for not slaying the murderer
 that if there were blame let it be upon his
 head then he spoke to hunsa  this
 has been decided upon dog that if thou
 confess reveal to us information that is of
 value to our people the torture shall cease
 and no mans hand in the whole pindari
 camp shall be raised against thee either to
 wound or take thy life

     but the jail hazari sahib

     no dog if thou but tell the truth in
 full that we may profit to-morrow you
 may go free and if any man in the camp
 wounds you his life will pay for it till
 noon you may have for the going even
 food for your start on the way back to the
 land of your accursed tribe by the beard
 of the prophet no man of all the pindari
 force shall wound you now speak quick
 for i have given a pledge

   there were murmurs among the jama-
 dars at kassims terms for their hearts
 were full of hate for the creature who had
 slain their loved chief but kassim was a
 man famous for his intelligence in all the
 councils amir khan had been swayed by
 the hazaris judgment it was an accursed
 price to pay they felt but the chief was
 dead to kill his slayer perhaps was not as
 great a thing as to have hunsas confession
 written and attested to all that vast horde
 of fierce-riding pindaris and bundoolas had
 been gathered by amir khan with the ob-
 ject of being a power in the war that was
 brewing-the war in which the mahrattas
 were striving for ascendancy and the brit-
 ish massing to crush the mahratta horde
 it had been amir khans policy to strike
 with the winning force perhaps his big
 body of hard-riding sowars being the very
 power that would throw the odds to one or
 other of the contenders their reward
 would be loot unlimited loot so dear to
 the heart of the pindari and an assign-

    ment of territory to know beyond doubt
 who had instigated the murder of the
 chief was precious knowledge it might
 be as the gulab had said sindhias dewan
 but there was the english officer there at
 that time and the message of friendship
 may have been a message of deceit and
 the true object the slaying of amir khan
 who was looked upon as a great leader

   hunsa had lay watching furtively the
 effect of the commanders words upon the
 others

    then he spoke  i will tell the truth
 hazari for thou hast given a promise in
 the name of allah that  am free of death
 at the hands of thy people

     wait dog of an infidel kassim com-
 manded  quick call the mullah to write
 the confession for this is a sin to be washed
 out in much blood and the proof must be
 at hand so the guilty will have no plea for
 mercy also it is a matter of secrecy we
 here being officers will have it on our honor
 and the mullah because of his priesthood
 will not speak of it also he will bear wit-
 ness of its sanctity

   soon a pindari announced  com-
 mander sahib here is the holy one and at
 a word from kassim the priest unrolled his
 sheets of yellow paper and sitting cross-
 legged upon a cushion with a salaam to
 the dead chief dipped his quill in a little
 ink horn and held it poteed

   then hunsa his eyes all the time fur-
 tively wratching the scowling faces about
 him fear and distrust in his heart over the
 gift of his life but impelled by his know-
 ledge that it was his only chance narrated
 the story of nana sahib and the dewan s
 scheme to rid the mahrattas of the leader
 they feared amir khan told that they
 knew that the british were sending over-
 tures for an alliance but that fearing to
 kill the messenger-unless it could be done
 so secretly it would never be discovered
 they had determined to remove the chief
 when he spoke of the other bagrees kas-
 sim realized that in the excitement of fix-
 ing the murder upon one there they had
 forgotten his troop associates and a hur-
 ried order was passed for their capture

  of course it was too late the others at
 the first alarm had slipped away
caste



  when the confession was finished kas-
sim commanded the mullah to rub his cube
of india ink over the thumb of the decoit
and the mark was imprinted on the paper

then he was taken to one of the cave cells
cut out of the solid rock beneath the palace
and imprisoned for the night

   come jamadars kassim said and his
voice that had been so coarse and rough
now broke and sobs floated the words
scarcely articulate  and reverently let us
lay amir khan upon his bed then
though there be no call of the muezzin we
will kneel here even without our prayer
carpets and pray to allah for the repose of
the soul of a true musselman and a great
warrior may his rest be one of peace 

  he passed his hand lovingly over the face
of the chief and down his beard and his
strong fearless eyes were wet

  then amir khan was lifted by the jama-
dars and carried to a bed in the room that
adjoined the surya mahal

  when they had risen from their silent
prayer kassim said  go you to your
tents i will remain here with the guard
who watch

chapter xxiv

the freedom of hunsa

captaix barlow and bootea had
gone from the scene of the murder
through the long dimly lighted hall
its walls broken here and there by niches
of mystery some of them closed by marble
fretwork screens that might have been
doors and down the marble stairway in
silence barlow had slipped a hand under
her arm in the way of both physical and
mental sustaining his fingers tapped her
arm in affectionate approbation once he
muttered to himself in english  splendid
girl and not comprehending the gulab
turned her star eyes upward to his face

  at the gate the soldier who had accom-
panied them spoke to the guard and the
latter standing on a step bellowed  ho
ye pindaris here goes forth the afghan in
innocence of the foul crime above they
have the slayer who was hunsa the thug
and praise be to allah they will apply

the torture let him pass in peace all ye
and take care that no one molest the beau-
tiful gulab the peace of allah upon the

soul of the great amir khan

  a rippling thunder of deep voices vi-
brated the thronged street crying  allah
akbar the peace of god be upon the soul

of the dead chief

  a lane was opened up to them by the
grim wild-eyed bandit-looking horsemen
tulwar over shoulder and knives in belt
who called  back ye the favored of
the commander passes back make way
tis an order

  the faces of the soldiers that had been
wreathed in revenge and blood lust when
barlow had been brought were now
friendly and there were cries of  salaam
brother salaam flower of the desert
for it had been spread that the gulab had
discovered the murderer had denounced
him

   brave little gulab barlow said in a
low voice bending his head to look into
her eyes for he felt the arm trembling
against his hand

  she did not answer and he knew that she
was sobbing

  when they were past the turbulent crowd
he said  bootea your people will all have
fled or been captured

   yes sahib she gasped

   perhaps even your maidservant will
have been taken

   no sahib they would not take her
her home is here

  by her side he traveled to where the now
deserted tents of the decoits stood silent
and dark like little pagodas of sullen crime
a light flickered in one tent and silhou-
etted against its canvas they could see the
form of a woman crouched with her head
in her hands

   the maid is there barlow said  but
it is not enough i will bring my blankets
and sleep here at the door of your tent

   no sahib it is not needed the girl
protested

   yes bootea i will come then with
a little laugh he added  the gods have
ordained that we take turns at protecting
each other it is now my turn i will come
soon

  she turned her small oval face up to
look at this wonderful man to discover if
he were really there that it was not some
kindly god who would vanish he clasped
the face with its soul of adoration in his
two palms and kissed her then fearing
that she would fall for she had closed her
eyes and reeled he took her by the arm
opened the flap of the tent and steadied
her into the arms of her handmaid

   it was a fitful nights sleep for barlow
 the beat of horses hoofs on the streets or
 the white sands beyond was like the patter
 of rain on a roof there were hoarse bull-
 throated cries of men who rode hither and
 thither tremulous voices floated on the
 night air wild dirges like the weird afghan
 love song sometimes a long smooth-bore
 barked its sharp call at sunrise the cap-
 tain was roused from this tiring sleep by
 the strident weird sing-song of the mullah
 sending forth from a minaret of the palace
 his call to the faithful to prayer-prayer for
 the dead chief and when the voice had
 ceased its muezzin

   allah akbar allah akbar

   confess that there is no god hut god

   confess that mahomet is the prophet of god

   come to prayer come to prayer

   for prayer is better than sleep

the big drums sent forth a thundering re-
verberation

  he could hear the voices of the two
women within and called  bootea
bootea 

  the gulab came shyly from the tent
saying  salaam sahib then she stood
with her eyes drooped waiting for him to
speak

    it is this bootea barlow said  do
not go away until i am ready to depart
then i will take you wherever you wish
to go

    if it is permitted sahib i will wait
 she answered as simply as a child

   barlow put a finger under her chin and
lifting her face smiled like a great boy say-
ing  gulab you are wonderfully sweet

  then barlow went to the serai looked
after his horse had his breakfast and
passed back into the town he saw a con-
tinuous stream of men moving toward the

 small river that swept southward to the
 east of the town and asking of one the
 cause he was told that the murderer-for

 now hunsa was known as the ahtria-mur-
 derer-was being sent on his way the
 speaker was a rajput  it is strange af-
 ghan that one who has slain the chief of
 these wild barbarians who are without
 gods should be allowed to depart in peace
 we rajputs worship a god that visits the
 sin upon the head of the sinner but the or-
 der has been passed that no man shall harm
 the slayer of amir khan perhaps it is
 whispered in the bazaar that commander
 kassim coveted the chiefship

    barlow being in the guise of a mussul-
 man said solemnly  allah will punish the
 murderer mark you well man of rajas-
 than

    as to that afghan one stroke of a
 tulwar would put the matter beyond doubt
 as it is let us push forward because i see
 from yonder steady array of spears that the
 pindaris ride toward the river and i think
 the prisoner is with them it was one
 hunsa a thug and though the thugs wor-
 ship bhowanee they are worse than the
 mhangs who are of no caste at all

   as barlow came to where the town
 reached to the river bank he saw that the
 concourse of people was heading south
 along the river this was rather strange
 for a bridge of stone arches traversed by
 the aid of two islands the xahal to the
 other side a quarter of a mile lower down
 he came to where the river that above wan-
 dered in three channels over a rocky bed
 now glided sluggishly in one channel it
 was like a ribboned lake smooth in its slow
 slip over a muddy bed and circling in a
 long sweep to the bank on the level plain
 was a concourse of thousands-horsemen
 who sat their lean-flanked marwari or
 cabul horses as though they waited to
 swing into a parade the march past the
 sowars he had seen in the town were in front
 of barlow riding four abreast and at a
 command from their leader opened up and
 formed a scimitar-shaped band their
 horses noses toward the river as he came
 close barlow saw kassim in a group of
 officers and hunsa a soldier on either side
 of him was standing free and unshackled in
caste



front of the commander save for the
clanking of a bit or the clang of a spear-

haft against a stirrup or the scuffle of a
quick-turning horses hoofs a silence rested
upon that vast throng wild barbaric
faces held a look of expectancy of wonder-
ment for no one knew why the order had
been passed that they were to assemble at
that point

  kassim caught sight of barlow as he
drew near and raising his hand in a salute
said  come close sahib the slayer of
amir khan in accordance with my prom-
ise is to go from our midst a free man his
punishment has been left to allah the one
god

  without more ado he stretched forth his
right arm impressively toward the murky
stream where it rippled at some disturb-
ance carried on its bosom ribbons of gold
where the sun fell saying

   yonder lies the way infidel strangler
slayer of a follower of the prophet de-
part for failing that it lacks but an hour

dll the sun reaches overhead and thy time
will have elasped-thou will die by the tor-
ture you are free even as i attested by
the beard of the prophet and more what
is not in the covenant -kassim drew
from beneath his rich brocaded vest a dag-
ger its blade still carrying the dried blood
of the chief- this is thine to keep thy vile
life if you can seest thou if the weapon
is still wedded to thy hand it is that thou
goest hand in hand with thy crime

  he handed the knife to a soldier with a
word of command and the man thrust it
in the belt of hunsa

  even as kassim ceased speaking two
round bubbles floated upon the smooth
waters of the sullen river and above them
was a green slime then a square shovel just
topped the water and barlow could hear
issuing from the thing of horror a breath
like a sigh he shuddered it was a
square-nosed mugger-crocodile - waiting
and beyond the water here and there
swirled as if a powerful tail swept it

to be concluded next week

in an old home

 the thoughts of other days they keep

      they will not brook a newer thing

 from smoke-stained rafters where they sleep
   the boneset and lobelia swing

 the old-time carpet on the floor

 the hair-cloth sofa straight and grim
 while from those fallswatch evermore
 ancestral portraits quaint and dim

 and yet their rooms a lurking power
    of sleep to wakeful eyelids bear

 as if some dream-filled poppy-flower
 had died and left its essence there

 a strange allurement where my heart

    feels all earths hopes and pleasures cease

 yet finds from modern ways apart

 a refuge and a sense of peace

treats a wicked snare drum in the orchestra
of the palatial theater has often told me
that he would write some of the things hes
seen if he could ever find the time

  thirty minutes later i came out of a
doze eddie was evidently on the final lap
of the story after the first hundred words
i knew we were both wasting our time but
i didnt have the courage to smear the glow
of happiness in his eyes he thought the
yarn he was telling was a million dollars in
liberty bonds but to my mind it wasnt
worth keeping awake to hear

 and that busted up the romance ali-
cia took the baby and went weeping back

to father gordon said  you may be my
mother but i think youre a meddling old
hag if youd kept your mouth shut i
wouldnt have shot him then he leaped
for new york shipped on a tramp as a
common sailor and never came back how
could he after what had happened

    well the old dame sold all the furni-
ture in the apartment eddie concluded
 went down to atlantic city and vamped
an ancient gent on the boardwalk he had
a soft spot in the bean and he married her
before the courts could say he was insane
now the old dame is worth millions what
dyou think of that

    rotten i replied mournfully  the
thing is absurd and unbelievable why
youve made a woman deliberately ruin her
sons life and then marry money after-
ward tt may be true eddie and every-
thing but i wouldnt send that to a maga-
zine on a bet the dear public likes to
think of mothers as nice sweet white-
haired old ladies they dont want to admit


broadway stuff



that mothers are just as selfish as men

are

some of them are worse eddie de-
clared heatedly  why i could tell

you-

   dont i interrupted  im going to
go home and write the story about the poor
girl who marries the young millionaire
that yarn has been printed seven times a
month for the last five years its what the
public wants and im going to give it to
them

  eddie groaned and sipped his coffee si-
lently his eyes traveled over the queer
crowd that inhabits the automat song
writers who have never sold a song moving
picture actors who have never been filmed
weird-looking people who were born and
raised in new york city smart well-
dressed people from the middle west a
chorine or two stage hands from near-by
theaters soda fountain clerks and their
sweeties just from the opera college pro-
fessors newly produced from a moving pic-
ture show

   you gimme acute indigestion with that
chatter he said at last  i read a maga-
zine once and it wasnt half as interesting
as the joshing in the cigar store why
dont you write some of the things that
have happened to me theyd make a
good story better than the ones they print
in magazines

   had heard this sort of remark before
and i knew what he meant unfortunate-
ly the sort of things that had happened to
him were more suitable for publication in
the smoking room gazette than in a mag-
azine that was supposed to travel through
the mails

   theres stuff happening on broadway
every day he persisted  that makes the
magazine stories pale and sickly now
take the case of-

   wait a minute is this sweet and
pretty no devilish mothers in it no
cold-blooded murders no-

   pin your ears back and listen eddie
interrupted  heres men and women
they eat sleep fight they fall in love
whats a murder or two

   ill cut the murders out i murmured
but eddie was off

   she was spanish she said but i always
thought that square-jawed kind came from
somewhere in hungary or one of those hick
nations that have got names you cant pro-
nounce but lolita de soto was different
from the usual run of hunkies

   for one thing she had small feet and
ankles and a tiny mouth but it wrasnt
anything about her looks that got her over
though the photographs in the clipper made
her look different-and interesting-in a
queer way no lolita got by on clothes
and-the thing that one woman in ten
thousand gets from the devil

   it makes a man stare and then start
in her direction ive seen her drift out of
her hotel and just pass across the sidewalk
and men walking along in a hurry would
skid to a stop lolita had it-she was like
that girl you saw in the subway train last
week the girl you saw for a bit of a sec-
ond and that youll remember for the rest
of your life

   clothes she had em by the dozen
anything she put on looked a thousand
times better than it would look on any
other woman in the world thats what
broadway thought particularly chet van
wert and she drew down what she could
which was much and she played around as
much as she liked which was much and
the van werts got worried

   for chet backed lolita in a couple of
flivver shows that is the shows fliwered
but they were in the rolls-royce class
when it came to cost and upkeep you
know the sort of chatter that flits about
broadway about the angel of a show well
im not saying a thing because im busy
concealing my own crimes

   eddie when does something happen in
this story i asked sadly  are you going
to drift into autobiography

   not to you he said grinning  what-
ever that is im busy telling you about
lolita chet and the bulldog-faced boy
from montana

   montana was first seen in row a seat
 on the first night of the third show
chet had purchased for lolita everybody
in the cast got into the gravy to say noth-
ing of the lad who staged it the scene paint-
ers the costumers the ushers and the or-


argosy-allstory weekly

cbestra i played the drums and i got
round-shouldered from carrying my weekly
jack home why dont they grow free
spenders like that now

   they grow i assured him  i sold
a story last week

   the editor ought to be fired eddie
commented  anyway montana occupied
the same seat during the first week the
show ran and sent invitations around for
every one in the company to come out to
his country place for the week-end sat-
urday night to monday afternoon those
that went raved all during monday nights
performance of course lolita didnt go
too proud boy they talked about the
sunken garden and the reception hall and
the guest chambers as though theyd never
lived in a sixth-floor back walk-up

   i should whisper about lolita eddie
inquired and then answered his own ques-
tion  not in a million years i do know
that dan reilly the usher took a note to
montana on tuesday evening the human
bulldog was in the same seat he had no
difficulty in getting it outside of the cut-
price theatergoers relatives of the chorus
girls and the ushers the theater was empty

   on the following day i heard further
details lolita eame in and that wednes-
day evening performance was a scorcher
on the stage die was sweet and lovely back
stage she raised hell she battled with the
he-lead she slapped a chorus girl she sassed
the stage manager and she insulted every-
body in the cast

   chet van wert came around with his
usual armful of flowers she was icily po-
lite to him and he started to talk to maida
warren a chorus lady lolita saw them
and-the volcano erupted

    that girl spoils the entire show i
think lolita began calmly then she
stared at maida ten twenty thirty seconds

	get her out of here 

   there was more to it but we wont re-
peat the unpleasant part

     ive invited her to go to dinner with
us to-night says chet after lolita had
stopped for breath  my friend bob
adams from montana wants to meet her
 now lolita had tried to meet montana
but he had ignored her note since she had

not been telephoned by the gent lolita felt

humiliated her annoyance wasnt both-
ered much by the news that maida was the
chick that montana was coming to the show

to see

   but lolita thought fast adams from
montana had turned her down and that
made her like him women you know
like to be snubbed by a man i remem-
ber-

   just a moment eddie all the women
ive snubbed i said  have mstandy
snubbed me dont generalize about

women

   leave it lay lets get on women
dont follow rules anyhow

   so lolita thought that shed switch
immediately after ordering chet to dis-
charge maida lolita rushed over and they
embraced

     oh im so glad youre going to din-
ner with us dear thats what lolita
chortled and maybe she got by with it
i dunno

   far be it from me to pass a remark
about a lady i know what lolita was
after and so do you chet van wert was
a good guy a little loose with his money
bugs about lolita but lolita had heard
whispers that the family was going to give
chet the razz and she was looking for an-
other gent with gelt from the booze fa-
vors autos and et cetera at montanas
country home he must own a mint so it
looked to lolita and i thought the same

    after the theater i whanged a sneering
triangle in one of those all-night supper
clubs naturally since it was the newest
and most expensive in new york the party
of four went there lolita looked like what
she wras maida looked like what she was
there was some contrast at that table

   chet van wert young clean-cut
nicked a little by the bright lights adams
from montana heavy thick-set bulldog
face prosperous lolita jewels and more
jewels a dress that shrieked complexion-
too much perfumed blase and superior
maida trim smart very faint complexion
wearing a coat suit and a little frill of white
at her throat and wrists

   i leave it to you to say who made a
hit before lolita had used her head she
broadway stuff



had monopolized chet or taken care that
he met her sort of women now for the
first time young van wert saw lolita and
the other sort together

   montana had the same idea from the
orchestra stand where i whanged the tri-
angle and other utensils of my profession
i could see that party of four and lolita
with all her pep personality and passion-
ate clothes was merely a good second not
an easy first but a good second

   but we never want what we can get
montana gave his entire attention to maida
but that penniless little chorine gave him-
nothing she shed sweet smiles at chet
van wert and he looked more than mildly
interested but not much more he was
still somewhat under lolitas charm and
considering the length of time she had held
him hog-tied and the stunts shed pulled in
the meanwhile he would be backing her in
more shows

   lolita of course was after new game
new wealthy game adams of the bulldog
face was being tracked down nobody else
in that restaurant saw what was going on
they just looked like a party of four mixed
like most parties of four are having supper
together

i would have missed the rest of this
except for alexandre the head waiter there

 mr adams at that table he says to me
leaving off the french accent because i
knew him when he was alex son of the
town druggist  wants a case taken up to
his apartment want to make ten on the
side eddie

   i nodded glad of the chance it meant
chaperoning a case of regular stuff in a taxi
somewhere me taking all chances of getting
pinched and so on thats where those rich
guys have it all over the poor-

   omit the sociology eddie i entreated
 i can hear that sort of a speil on the street
corner any night

   well i said all right about three or
four or some time when the place began to
get rough lolita and her gang blew they
all seemed to be o k though not pleased
isnt it funny how booze makes you feel
worse if you feel bad and better if you feel
good

   grabbed one end of a case of haig

and haig imported from canada at night
and bought a taxi the chauffeur of my
machine tried to drive me up a dark street
so he could hold me up and i had to shove
a gat in his spine before hed slow down
from sixty an hour but i got to the apart-
ment at last and just in time to have seven
chills at once

    wherell you have the sudden death
says i pleasantly dragging in the case

   chet was glued and mussy he want-
ed to fight somebody it was a peach of an
apartment and there was but one peach in
the room that was maida and it looked
odd that shed stuck with that crowd so
long

   in about ten minutes chet would be
wrestling with the furniture if he couldnt
get a scrap from any one lolita looking
like shes look in ten years was standing
next to montana he was giving her a
sour glare there was a mean curl to
adamss mouth that i didnt like

   nobody answered so i tried again

 wtieres the cellar in this place or shall
i leave it here

     i was promised ten says i  and taxi
fare that makes it twelve fifty

   borrow your gun adams said chet
picking up a black automatic from the table

 think ill make this bootlegger sing a
song then he turns to me  sing  sweet
adeline  says he weaving over closer

   i stood there like a dumb fool  i cant
turn a tune says i  sorry twelve fifty
gents and ill wander

     liar  said chet and slaps me with his
open hand  sing and he lifts his hand
again

   i dont mind telling you that made me
mad before i had decided that chet
should have one on the point of the jaw-
job or no job-maida butted in she caught
chets hand and turned him around

    dont be silly says she  let the
man-	t

   that was when chet was silly i heard
a funny kind of gasp from him he was
pointing like a hunting dog there across
the room from him in a regular moving
picture clutch was lolita and adams from
montana

   i dont know what most people would


argosy-allstory weekly

do but i know what chet did he had a
gun in his hand and he had some sort of
right to lolita that woman would knock
your eye out and chet had shed a lot of
the family fortune battled with his family
and generally raised shrieking hell on her
account well it looked like she was plan-
ning to toss him

     what-lolita  he says in a sort of a
scared whisper

     ive told you that she wasnt particular
in her language  take that little chick and
get out says she only she didnt call maida
a chick  im through with you says she

    that automatic did make a lot of noise
i just stood there with my mouth open and
listened to it spit one two three chet
gave him the trio while montana came to-
ward him

    ive got to give that western guy credit
hed stagger but he kept on coming when
he reached the table he seemed to crumple
up and fall sidewise he turned over a
couple of inkwells and his hand went to
his heart

   after a while i closed my mouth i
had to i felt the round muzzle of chets
revolver sticking in my side but chet
didnt have the gun it was maida

     dont make a sound says she  keep
your mouth shut and lead the way to the
taxi im going to get chet out of this

   you can bet i stepped softly i took
one glance at lolita and saw her staring
at the gentleman on the table by now
chet was a white ghost all the booze was
out of him he clung to maidas hand like
a frightened kid

    go upstairs says maida when we
reached the hall  and push the button for
the elevator we all climbed up one flight
just as doors began to open we were
standing there me jamming the button
when an old guy wearing a nightshirt-i
didnt know anybody wore one of them now
-poked his head out of the door

    whats the matter burglars says
he

   i couldnt say a word but maida was
calm enough

     thats a taxi back firing says she

 hes been having trouble with his car

   well it was lucky we were upstairs

lolita on the floor below let loose the loud-
est collection of shrieks ive ever heard of
course we three didnt know anything about
it when the elevator finally came up to
our floor there was a crowd around her lis-
tening to her scream and so we got chet
to the grand central station without any
trouble at all

   eddie sighed and looked reflectively at
his empty coffee cup  theres a good
story for you he said  why dont you
write that and sell it to a magazine

    oh for about a dozen reasons i re-
plied  ive listened to you but- look
at what youve given me a man kills an-
other man and escapes thats no good
im going to write the story of the poor girl
who marries the rich young man ever
magazine prints that story ever so often i
need nourishment eddie

  he smiled in a superior and extremely
irritating manner  youve got me wrong
he declared  thats the way with you
bum writers you listen but you dont
hear he shook his head sadly  he
eats he sleeps he talks he looks like a
human being but-thats all your head
should be used as the corner stone of a
mausoleum

    you can say what you like i retorted
a trifle brusquely  i never argue with a
man twenty pounds heavier and ten years
younger but the story you told me is
hopeless if you dont write the story of
the poor girl who marries a rich young
man youve got to write the story with a
tw-ist on the end now you havent given
me either

   eddie gazed mournfully at the ceiling of
the automat i looked upward also and
saw it for the first time at last he spoke

    at times he remarked reflectively  i
believe you have the mental development of
a moving picture actor but at other times i
am doubtful take the story i have just
told you for instance theres about a
dozen words more to it

    w hen the gang in the apartment house
came into montanas place they expected
to see his dead body lying on the table but
it wasnt there and it wasnt on the floor
under the table and it wasnt in the
room either
broadway stuff



   so some of them says  home-made
hooch and the rest of them says  my
god ghosts and the gang blows leaving
lolita to pick up her wraps and go home
alone she made a quick exit

     rode in the taxi to the grand central
 station while chet tells maida how grate-
 ful he is for her saving him from the con-
 sequences of his awful crime they get
 out and i buy two tickets for california
 and comes back to the apartment mon-
 tana has just finished washing his hands
 and was climbing into a clean shirt

     well says he  did it work

   perfect says i and we shake hands
  and the next day mrs van wert
 chets mother pays us off ive got that
 gat in my room now ill show it to you
 some time

  you were paid off i exclaimed
 was this whole thing a frame-up

    sure eddie replied in a long-suffer-
 ing voice  ill explain it to you four
 times and maybe youll understand it next
 week mrs van wanted to get chet away
 from lolita she borrowed the country

estate and the apartment from a friend so
that montana could make a splash adams
from montana is a friend of mine who
works daytimes sometimes on the police
force hes supposed to be a detective
the gun was not loaded it was filled with
blanks adams dabbled his fingers in red
ink and made red marks on his shirt
maida was in on the scheme though neither
chet or lolita knew it eddie sighed
deeply and began again  mrs van wanted
to get chet- he patiently repeated the
same words over and over again

   i get it i howled at last  i under-
stand dont tell me that again

  eddie lighted a cigarette and we rose for
smoking is not permitted in the automat
 and if you must write the story of the
poor girl who marries a rich guy-

   i know i interrupted  you bought
two tickets for california maida was a
poor little chorus girl but chet married
her and they lived-

   sure said eddie  isnt that a peach
of a story

  what do you think

tenanted

m

 y heart was an empty castle
 wide open swung the doors
 and the cold wind blew
 and the rain beat through
 and trickled on the floors

 the sacred room was vacant
 but a cherub came to see-
 a smiling thing

 with downy wing-
 and lo i turned the key

 and now the hall is lighted
 from basement to above

      and the doors barred tight
      both day and night

 to keep it warm for love

springtime its wonderful-its
marvelous i knew it-i knew you
could do anything in the world you
put your mind to

the inventor shook his head

 its all right-but it takes two people
to run it and im not two people and that
father of yours is due for one big panning
from somebody i tried to get a loan from
him to hire somebody and he kidded me on
and on until i spilled myself all over the
place and then told me to get to hell out
of there oh my good gosh if only he
worked for me sometime

he walked gloomily to the machine and
with one strong wrench tore the hopper off

this story began in

 kitty clasped him with both of her arms

 and almost screamed

 springtime you mustnt its won-
 derful

  whats the use i cant turn with one
 hand and pick with the other can i and
 i havent the coin to hire any one

 kitty looked at him-and then laughed
  silly old springtime just as though
 i wouldnt turn the crank or blow up a
 bank or do anything to help you there
 isnt anything about this crank turning that
 i couldnt master is there

 springtime shook his head

  couldnt be done

  why not

  well it couldnt thats all

                 you could hire me to do it said kitty
                 and pay me when you got the money

 stead he slapped his thigh and guffawed in
 his best stable manner

    do you know what you remind me of
these guys that pflay tunes on a table full
of bells you know- and he gave an
exceedingly broad imitation of the vaude-
ville performer who with bells of all
tongues and sizes spread out before him
plays  poet and peasant

   springtime did not stop he smiled for
osborne had the gift of caricature but
went on with his bell ringing then the old
man took out his watch and looked at it
shook it and held it to his ear

    son you must be sick he said  its
eight minutes past twelve didnt you hear
the whistles blow

   apparently osborne was ignoring kitty
rather pointedly she stopped turning the
crank and stretched herself cautiously
rubbed her elbows and forearms and shook
herself her father without any reference
to her as his daughter said  always keep
your help comfortable never coddle them
this girl ought to have a chair to sit in
springtime looked his contrition and
kitty walked past her father without a
glance the old man knew just how far
he could go with kitty and there was a
spark in her eye that told him this was one
of the times when he ought to keep still
springtime was rather elaborate in the way
he settled the beans down on the half-full
sack and in the way he pushed the full one
back so that the door could swing farther
than it had ever swung before but if he
hoped to draw some favorable comment
from the old man it did not work

  at noon he carried a chair down and
made a hay cushion for kitty out of a grain
sack when she was comfortable there
was nothing to stop him for the rest of the
afternoon and he set out to make a record
ah afternoon while the sun spots crawled
across the floor and up the walls kitty
clung to the handle stopping only when
springtime carried away a full sack or to
fill the hopper which he did as though he
were carrying buckets of water to a fire
the bouncing of the black beans and the
purring song of the good ones spurred him
on as a chanty spurs on a sailor

   neither spoke except that at periodic

intervals springtime asked if she were tired
and kitty said no no dont stop 
all afternoon his fingers flew like those of
an expert needle woman and when a big
bag was full he tied it and juggled it out of
sheer happiness

  when the plow works whistle blew and
kitty slumped down in the chair six bushels
were finished altogether one by hand in
four days and five by machine in one day
springtime reckoned that what with the
stops he had had to make this was not a
sample working day and that with uninter-
rupted time he could finish within three
more days free to follow the trials of his
fancy-free except for one thing the loyal
kitty who had stuck by the handle as a
mother sticks to a crib in spite of his
success he felt that he was not the man to
make her happy and as the unculled beans
diminished so the wandering half of him
began to shout for its rights

   i wish said kitty as she got out of
the chair  that you could top dad in get-
ting a good price for these beans he al-
ways gets the top of the market and hes
as proud of it as a man could be of any-
thing if you could get a cent or two above
him he would respect you more than he
does any one

   those are great beans said spring-
time  there isnt a one there thats a half
shade off color

   i know all about this price business
said kitty  ive shopped around for wo-
mens things and ive seen the same things-
mufflers for instance-in two different
stores with about a third difference in the
prices one place would have a little card
over the muffler saying  hand-loomed  or
something like that and that was what the
extra dollar or so was for do you know
what hand-loomed means

  springtime shook his head

   neither do i nobody does but people
fall for it and the store that puts the card
on the muffler and sells it for a third more
sells ten times as many as the other store

i wonder what you could call these you
couldnt call beans hand-loomed could
you

   hand-picked suggested springtime

   but they arent-theyre machine-

                           	a
the bird of passage



  picked although you do most of the work

  with your hands dont you hand-picked
is overworked anyway-we ought to think
of something better than that

    springtime leaned his head on his hands
and thought but could get nothing better
than  milled

    not so good not so good said kitty
still turning the crank absent-mindedly  i
have it extra fancy-remilled

    gee  said springtime in awe  thats
wonderful extra fancy remilled michigan
beans that ought to be worth five cents
more a bushel

  you go and try it now said kitty
 theres just one place in town that would
give you five cents a bushel over the market
for remilled beans and thats pasquales
grocery he has everything queer like alli-
gator pears and anchovies and funny salad
oils and everything he has is the very best
there is and a lot more expensive than any-
bodys hes open now-will be until a
quarter to six i know because ive had
to run down there to get cream lots of times
but first go to the elevator-theyll tell you
there how much the regular price is and
dont you let these go for a cent less than
five cents a bushel above that price

  springtime looked at tom osbornes
daughter with still greater awe she was
her fathers daughter with her fathers prac-
tical sense but as she stood there fawn-
like in figure with the luminous eyes show-
ing their ruddy depths in the sunlight she
looked more like a creature out of a fairy
tale

    youre all right was all that he could
think of to say although that half of him
which she owned body and soul wanted to
say more

   he filled a small sack with his product
walked down to the elevator and found that
the latest market quotation was two dollars
and ninety-five cents a bushel then he
went on until he stood before the aristo-
cratic plate-glass front of pasquales store
it was not a grocery store for the name
grocery store smacked of old days when the
open sugar barrel stood uncovered by a
front door that had no screen in the sum-
mertime pasquale a neat plump good-
natured italian was a provision merchant

   	a

he took springtimes sack and poured some
of the contents into his palm he recog-
nized them at once

    mr osbornes beans he said

   yes remilled

  the thick eyebrows shot up

   remilled

   sure-a new process which he is just
trying out thats a good sample if any-
thing the rest of the beans are better than
that absolutely no dark ones-every bean
is hard plump and as white as a china egg
the remilling takes care of that

  sure sure said the provision mer-
chant with a twinkle in his liquid eye  i
give you two ninety-five a bushel

    couldnt possibly sell for less than three
five said springtime as he tied up the neck
of his sample bag and slipped it into his
pocket  two ninety-five wouldnt pay for
the remilling were planning to send them
to the big chicago hotels

  they compromised on three dollars a
bushel-five cents above the elevator price
and springtime trundled his bushel down on
a wheelbarrow and when he got there the
store was closed not to him but to cus-
tomers pasquale was working on his win-
dows which he changed every day one
was full of a pyramid of fruits of all kinds
with small bottles of rainbow-colored cor-
dials tucked into the crevices the other was
empty except for a big sheet of white paper
which covered the entire bottom of the win-
dow after he had been paid springtime
lingered long enough to see his beans put
into a clean new basket which pasquale
tipped slowly so that they spilled out in an
even flow like lava running from a volcano
he propped the basket there and then put
a small sign in the middle of the lava flow-
a card jagged at the ends to look like a
rustic sign post the card read  early
osbornes remilled-the better bean

caught

the osborne household lived under a
double strain after kitty had given
johnnys story to the newspaper man
-first there was the strain of expecting


argosy-allstory weekly

news and second the great effort to keep
ihe wary johnny from knowing that any-
thing was in the wind

  the net drew closer about him it was
less than a week after the newspaper writer
had set his typewriter chattering over the
story of the checker-playing marvel when
mrs osborne fluttered into the tin shed
with a slip of newspaper flimsy and a tele-
gram the girl ceased her everlasting turn-
ing of the crank and cried out with joy
when she read the telegram and the mes-
sage from her friend of the pen

   publicity brings results said the note
and the telegram read

    mrs k martin  harrison street this
  city thinks checker-playing boy her runaway
  son john please advise how to get boy here

   r dean editor wellsville ohio courant

   wellsville cried kitty turning the
slip over and over in her hand  why
that isnt sixty miles from here on the state
road dad and i have driven it dozens of
times

   wellsville said springtime  i know
that burg theres a good hangout there
and the bulls are all easy sure it isnt
over sixty miles from here the slick little
devil i wonder if he knows how close to
home he is

  mrs osborne charged toward the door
but kitty intercepted her she did not trust
her mothers judgment in times like these

  im going to find johnny cried the
mother  he ought to know most cer-
tainly

  oh good gosh no said springtime
and kitty seized her mother by the arm and
hung tight

   hed be gone like a shot moms
dont please dont youll ruin every-
thing even if you look as though there were
anything out of the way you have no
idea what a wild lad that is

   that boy said mrs osborne with
dignity  would want his mother again
that i know even if he is abnormal the
reason why he seems not to want to go
home is because he doesnt remember his
home that is perfectly clear to me al-
though it seems to escape the rest of you
however i decline any responsibility in

the matter and you may count on ray si-
lence go ahead as you see fit

  when she had gone out of the shed
springtime and kitty looked at each other
those long silent hours there when kitty
was turning the crank and springtime was
playing bell ringer had built up a camara-
derie so that she understood his unspoken
thought

   gee well have to be wary said
kitty  well have to be as cautious as
anything well take him home you and
i in the flivver i can drive it and you can
hang onto him-maybe hell fight when he
see where hes going

   pm wondering if its the right place
said springtime  it sure would be a
peach if we dragged him off to a mother he
didnt belong to i have an idea that a
mother with a lost kid would be so anxious
to believe that he was alive that any old
picture of a healthy lad would look like her
own id better telegraph and find out 
know a fence there whos wise to everything
in that town how about it

   right as always said kitty  whats
a fence

   never mind youll never see one-
leastways the kind of fence i mean

    be careful cautioned kitty  and ill
slip it to dad when he comes home

   on the way to the telegraph office spring-
time met johnny-johnny with traces of
blood on his upper lip and a rent in his
knickerbocker suit he stopped when he
saw springtime coming and waited for him

   gee ive been playing football he
said  and you ought to have seen me get
away with that ball i sure showed these
hick kids what playing is

  go on said springtime incautiously
 that town you come from is about half
the size of this one i laugh at you when
you call this a hick place did you ever
hear the old proverb about people that lived
in glass houses not throwing stones
yeah said johnny as he cocked an
eye at his pal  where you heading

   down the street

   ill go with you

   you will not im busy

  oh sleuth stuff mocked johnny
 or are you buying the girl a ring cant
the bird of passage



spill it can you all right dont i dont

  give a damn

     he started up the street and springtime
  waited until he was well out of sight before
  he dodged into the telegraph office and sent
  a message to his friend the fence

find out if there is iron dog in the yard of

   mrs k martin  harrison street wire t
   osborne collect

  he signed his moniker of springtime for
the good reason that no man on the road
knew him by any other name when he
was back in the house one shrewd twinkle
from osbornes eye told him that the old
man knew what was in the wind

  avhen the door bell rang the head of the
house got up with a grumbled  thats for
me im expecting a telegram he came
back into the dining room and finished his
supper in a silence which springtime and
kitty tried hard to keep from being sus-
piciously electric when osborne had fin-
ished he lighted a cigar and strolled out
into the darkness of the lawn and after a
moment springtime followed

   the iron dogs there said the old
man  ill miss the little devil dont
know but what ill keep track of him and
see that he gets an education hes bright
-what he needs is ballast you and kitty
take him home-he might suspect me be-
cause ive been threatening him with so
many things that he wont ride with me any
more you get out the old flivver in the
morning the minute he shows up out doors
and throw a sack of beans in the back
then tell him youre carrying them to some
place for me and ask him if he wants to
ride hell fall-maybe but gosh if he
doesnt put up a fight when he sees his
own burg coming over the horizon ill eat
my hat hes sure a home-keeping spirit-

i dont think watch your step or therell
be one kid missing at dawn

  they were all cautious but even so
johnny caught a warning from somewhere
and after he and springtime had got into
bed the lad lay with his head off the pillow
and his bright eyes fixed on the wanderer

   springtime he asked  whats all this
hush stuff

 by gosh said springtime  trust you

  to smell it out sure youve got a great
  nose for news osbornes pulling some po-
  litical dope and its absolutely necessary
  that nobody know anything about it i
  told him he neednt be afraid of you but
  he said you played around some with the
  son of the guy he wants to keep in the
  dark

   johnny chuckled

   i knew there was something up he
said dropped his head to the pillow and
was asleep in two winks

   kitty and springtime skulked around the
barn door until they saw johnny come out
on the lawn then springtime slammed
the doors back and kitty backed the little
machine out with the exhaust wide open
johnny drifted over toward the drive and
stood watching while springtime heaved a
sack of beans into the tonneau and then
put his foot on the running board kitty
with the true touch of the artist started
and then stopped and leaning out said

 oh johnny do you want to come along
   where you going

   out in the country long drive
sure said johnny and vaulted the
fence and jumped into the rear seat with
the beans

   come around in front suggested
springtime  theres room for three and
well keep each other warm its a nippy
morning

  johnny clambered over and took a place
between springtime and kitty as they
rolled out of the alley they saw osborne
standing on a corner and the hand that he
raised gave a signal of congratulation
kitty sailed past him for the reason that
she felt their greatest safety was in keeping
up such a speed that the boy would not
dare to leap out it was a cold fall morn-
ing so early that there was very little traf-
fic on the road the rush of wind whipped
the color into kittys cheeks and fanned
johnnys high spirits to a point where he
was almost a public nuisance he hailed
every foot passenger with  hey bindle
stiff and he had a greeting for every
horse and cow that hung its head out of
the frosted pastures

  the white road rolled under them at i

good twenty-five an hour springtime sat
with his hand along the back of the seat
where he could grasp the lads collar at the
slightest movement he did not dare to
look at kitty often nor did kitty dare to
look at him but when a sign post flashed
by which said  six miles to wellsville
springtime stole a look at kitty and saw
that she had not missed it her answer
was an increase in speed

  johnny kept up his chatter then in the
midst of it stopped as dead as if he had
been suddenly struck dumb springtime
laid his hand as if by accident on the boys
arm and looking at kitty saw that she was
pale from excitement johnny turned back
and stared at a clump of tall butternut trees
which stood in the middle of a field-three
trees placed in a triangle he said nothing
but turned his head to stare at a big brick
institution on a hill then a black water
tower swam up over the horizon

   springtime you snitcher yelled
johnny and became a hundred pounds of
living fury he was across springtime in a
flash and had the door open almost before
the man could get his arms around him and
drag him back springtime forced him
back into the seat and kitty white-faced
kept the car up to the top of its speed he
struggled like a wild cat swearing at the
top of his voice

   springtime you- he cried u you

low down dick you- ill get even with

you if it takes me all my life of all the
low down tricks i ever heard of oh gee
youre a fine guy you are youre a
prince if old bender knew about this

   im doing just what old bender want-
ed done said springtime grimly  and
take it easy son weve got you cold this
time and you might as well kick in

  johnny kept up his struggling until he
was exhausted then slumped down into the
seat and looked straight ahead of him the
car rattled over a bridge with a pool under
it and johnny sat up to look at it for that
was the swimming hole a quarter of a
mile farther on a few scattered houses swam
to meet them and then a circular high
board fence at sight of it johnny broke
into bitter speech again

   i suppose the old man put you up to

this hes one wise old bird he is what
a hick oh boy ha ha but his
laughter was a bit forced to tell the truth

the net was closing so completely around
johnny that he was almost ready to give

up

   once in the town kitty pulled up for
she did not know just where the lads home
was

    see this town said springtime who
thinking of the long time johnny had
tricked him felt justified in gloating a bit
 see this town wise guy well its your
home burg this is and im bringing you
back to it just the way bender asked me
to now wheres this street you live on

   i dont remember said johnny
 find it pinkerton youre so damned
smart

    sure said springtime   find it
drive along till we meet a police officer

  johnny squirmed but was quiet and
kitty pulled up when they came to a traf-
fic officer and within a minute they passed
a white house in the yard of which was
a black iron newfoundland with a white
tip on his tail kitty halted a few doors
beyond set the brakes and looked at
springtime

    i think maybe id better go ahead and
break it gently she said  these old
people cant take big news even good news
very calmly you come along in about two
minutes

   springtime nodded and kitty getting
out without a look at the sulky lad walked
in through the front gate the blinds were
closed on the front of the house and a faint
path led to the rear-a path which kitty
followed and which if she had been able
to read it would have told her the story
of a mothers heartbreak in it were worn
over heel prints of dozens of wanderers
for the word had gone forth that any man
who could spring a gag about having been
lured away from home by tramps as a lad
was sure to get a big feed in that white
house with the iron dog in the yard kitty
tapped on the back door and while waiting
read the names scribbled on the door frame
 frisco mike new orlean fatty
 cigarette she heard  soft step within
and the door swung open and the woman
the bird of passage



   who she knew must be jehnnys mother
 stood there-gray bent spectacled with a
 sad welcoming smile which altered a bit

  at sight of kitty

    is this mrs martin asked kitty
 trying to speak brightly and to keep the
 tears from welling up in her eyes  my
 name is katherine osborne and ive come
 to see you about something of importance

   the smile faded and johnnys mother
 clutched at the doorknob to keep herself
 from falling

     come in she said in a low voice and
 kitty walked in and stood in the middle of
 the floor

    its something quite nice she said
  something youll be glad to hear-oh so
 glad to hear its about a person youve
 been wanting to see for a long long time

   the old hands gripped tight under the
 white apron and then came out in a gesture
 of appeal with a low cry kitty stepped
 to her and took the frail figure in her strong
 arms where she held it tight rocking it and
 crooning its all right its your boy
 johnny come home again hell be in here
 in a minute or two and he wont want to
 see you with tears on your face hell
 want to see you smiling

    oh if you only knew if you only
 knew how id waited and prayed day
 after day and night after night-wondering
 where he was when it rained or when it was
 cold she broke into helpless sobbing
 and kitty seeing springtime peering into
 a window put out her hand to keep him
 back she held close until the sobbing had
 ceased then drew away and taking out her
 kerchief wiped the tears from the face of
 johnnys mother first and then from her
 own

     now you sit right here she said help-
 ing her charge into a chair  and be
 cheerful because you know johnny is a
 queer boy and i have an idea that the best
 way to make him want to stay home is not
 to appear to want him that is very
  much if you make a fuss over him hell
 be out of the door the next time he gets a
 chance

   kitty went to the door and beckoned
 springtime to come in he was holding
 the lad by the coat collar and by one arm

so that he could neither twist out of the

grip or slip out of the coat johnny was
still sulky but was looking with interest
at two boys who stood on the other side
of the fence with their mouths wide open
springtime led him in and shutting the
door put his back against it

  johnnys mother gripped her hands tight
and stayed in her chair although her lips
were trembling johnny looked up at the
ceiling and down at the familiar old carpet
sniffed the delicate scent of lemon cookies
and then spoke

   hello ma he said and took a step
across the room toward her there was a
struggle going on in him-the same strug-
gle that goes on when any wild thing is
domesticated the balance was very fine
and one false move on the part of his
mother would have tipped it the wrong
wtay

  she spoke in a calm silverv voice
 hello son

  johnny looked at her puzzled for he
was all set for a distasteful scene he drew
a step closer

   well ive been gone a long time

   yes son youve seen a heap of the
world i expect

   sure i have ma gosh ive seen some
great places-frisco and chi and york
gee you ought to see the tall buildings in
york ma theyd knock your eye right
smack out and the levees at newr or-
leans theyre great

   i suppose they are

  johnny stopped and looked hard at his
mother

   well you dont seem very glad to see
me he said with a suspicion of sulk in his
voice

   i am glad johnny gladder than i can
tell you but i suppose this little town
doesnt seem like much after youve been
in those big places

   well i dunno said the lad doubtfully
as he drew another step closer-so close
that he was within arms reach of his
mother  at first i thought id die if i
ever had to come back but seeing the old
swimming place and the trees where i used
to get butternuts and the old deef and
blind asylum on the hill and those two

peaveys rubbering over the fence just the
way they used to-it seems kind of good
to be back here after all

   youll find a lemon cookie in the jar
there

  johnny looked at his mother puzzled
and stepped up and put his hand on her
shoulder she met his eye steadily al-
though her hands were twisting the apron
hem

   say ma he said  arent you going
to give us a kiss

  then she took him in her arms and
springtime and kitty looked out the win-
dow for there was something so sacred in
the look on that old face that it seemed a
profanation just to watch it

  after a time johnny drew back and made
for the kitchen door for outside there was
the stir of a constantly collecting crowd of
his congeners springtime blocked his way
and looked down at him grimly the lad
swapped hard looks with him for a minute
and then his face relaxed

    aw hell he said   kick in

   for good

   aint i telling you get out of the
way you big lump 

  in spite of the bluster springtime knew
that one wild thing had been tamed

accomplishment

the end was undramatic all along
springtime had felt that when he fin-
ished his job in the galvanized iron
shed there ought to be a shower of meteors
or a concert by massed bands xothing
like that happened the last bean fell into
the open mouth of the sack without either
exploding or making sweet music kitty
felt the possibilities of the situation for as
the last one traveled along the belt she
decreased the speed until it moved milli-
meter by millimeter as it trembled on
the brink the movement was as slow as the
minute hand of a clock and when it fell
she said with a long breath  there  and
after they had looked at each other for a
long minute  you did it

  it was over all that remained was to

settle with osborne and he would be free
to go and even as he looked into that
friendly face that had helped him through
the dreariest job of his life springtime felt
that things had not changed since the time
when he had first discovered his love for
kitty he was as far as ever from being
able to take care of her and as he trundled
the rest of his share to pasquales store the
cold northwest wind was as full of invita-
tion to him as ever before

  leaving kitty would be a wrench but
staying would be a denial to his strongest
instinct the thought of what kitty might
think of him if after he had settled down
he failed as a man of business filled him
with panic when he had come back and
counted out kittys wages he sat for a
long time in the tin shed pondering and
the net result of that pondering was that
there were only three things left for him to
do settle with osborne say farewell to
kitty and pick up durkin at the mission

  at the bank osborne could see him and
did springtime walked into the inclosure
and slumped into the deep chair

   im through he said

   through with what

   beans you and i can settle up now
you said that when i had twenty bushels
done i could go provided i didnt want to
stay and finish the other twenty

  osborne looked at him without his usual
crisp snapping of the eyes he fumbled at
a button on his coat and cleared his throat
and finally said vaguely  settle up

  springtime nodded and still the old man
did not seem to comprehend he put on his
glasses and took them off put them on
again and finally let them dangle from one
finger tip while with his free hand he moved
the papers on his desk

   i suppose you want a settlement he
said

   man if you knew how  had waited for
this time to come you would not ask me
such a question youd know it

   i suppose you have been under a
strain said osborne gravely  a bigger one
than any of us realize youre fifteen
pounds lighter than you were so youve
finished-all through what do you think
you want to do
the bird of passage



   drift said springtime  god knows
what you have up your sleeve now but im

warning you that unless i do get free im

going to fight-in some way or another
youve had the drop on me and youve put
me through the worst three weeks ive ever
been through

   havent you learned anything from it
asked osborne and there was a glimmer of
his old self in the sharpness of the question
 nothing-except to hate work

   arent you glad that you stuck it out-
didnt give up-made a machine to take the
drudgery out of the job put a real piece
of work through by being patient

  go on said springtime bitterly
 how could i help being patient when you
had the drop on me it was a case of
sorting beans or breaking rock and im
darned if i dont think i had rather break
rock whats the sense in patting me on
the back for doing a job i had to do

   you didnt have to you could have
sat there in the shed and smoked brown
paper cigarettes until you had made a
smoked ham out of yourself there wasnt
any way i could force you to pick over
beans and the fact was that i didnt want
to force you-i rather hoped yqu would
choose to do it once you got started i
hoped you might learn to tackle a dull job
and stick through until it was done for the
reason that theres a great deal of just that
sort of drudgery in any kind of real mans
work lots of times a man swears when
he gets through building a house or training
a horse or anything that takes time hell
never tackle such a thing again but if he
has made a success of it he does take an-
other job and so on through life if hes
any good he takes on another even if he has
failed youre a rambler and i didnt know
but what-once youd got around a dull
piece of work-it might mean that you
would stay here and go into something per-
manent-factory or office or farm manage-
ment i think i could rake up something
springtime tipped his head back like a
dog howling at the moon and bayed  no
 all right all right-i was only trying
to be decent things around here need new
blood-these things im in and i dont
know what will become of em when im

gone have to sew em up in a trust fund

of some sort to keep the women folks from
investing in california air preferred

things need new blood he cleared his
throat heartily and jumped back into his
old manner  and i may add he con-
cluded rearing back in his chair  that that
same cast-iron nerve that unadulterated
pluperfect nerve which has carried you
through life so far would probably be quite
an asset even in as slow a town as this

  he took out his handkerchief and trum-
peted shot back his cuffs and all the bris-
tling aggressiveness of him came to the sur-
face

  you cant make a silk purse out of a
sows ear he said  and the chinese have
a proverb which says that rotten wood can-
not be carved-in plain united states that
means that a decent citizen cannot be made
out of a bum have you sold all your
share of those beans

   yes

   what did you get for them

   three dollars a bushel

  osborne pushed his chair back and looked
at his prisoner guest and employee

   now who the devil gave you three dol-
lars a bushel for beans when the top price
has been twro ninety-five for the past
month

   pasquale said springtime trying to
keep the triumph out of his face  the pro-
vision merchant

   what did you do blackjack him

   no i just told him that they had been
sorted by a special process called remilling
and he reckoned that was worth an extra
five cents a bushel he has a lot of them
in his window now with a card stuck in them
that says  early osbornes remilled the
better bean 

  osborne made a note on a pad-a fur-
tive movement which did not however es-
cape springtime

   no use he said gently  ive sold him
all he will take your share will have to go
to the elevator

   beat me to it huh son thats what i
mean when i say that things need new
blood ive been raising beans for years-
all kinds hand-picked hand-sorted but the
remilled bean the better bean never oh
	argosy-allstory weekly

my gosh remilled you know when i
started there were crooks in the provision
line but the wooden nutmeg was about the
top of their speed the best in those days
was plain best but now there are a hun-
dred fancy ways of getting the extra cent
out of people good apples went by the
barrel but now good apples have to be
wrapped and packed individually and shined
up i have a plot of land out west of towm
here that ive been cutting up and selling
off and those lots have been moving about
as fast as molasses in january but across
the road a smart aleck puts up a pair of
brick pillars and calls his place runnymede
manor and sells lots as though they were
hot cakes whered you get this idea of re-
milled

    it was kittys idea mosdy

    thank god for that said osborne de-
voutly  i could never look myself in the
face again if i had let a footloose bum like
you beat me out and you still think you
had rather be riding brake rods than living
here with a good job pay day every satur-
day and no cops to look out for

    id rather be the deadest bum said
springtime solemnly  than the livest mil-
lionaire that ever lived

   that statement seemed to take all the
crispness out of osborne again he became
aimless and vague and after he had figured
back and forth for five minutes he shut the
book and tore up the promissory note

   hell he said lets forget it if
youd been going to stay here i wrould have
stuck you for every cent you owe me but
since youre going back to the jungles youll
need every cent you know there might be
a market for a small hand power bean sorter
like that one you rigged up

    you can have my share of it said
springtime rising

    thats a contract returned osborne
quickly but seemed on his part loth to rise
he fumbled with the papers on his desk and
finally said in a hesitating way  you dont
think youd like to stay and do that other
twenty bushels

   springtime looked down at him with a
-pitying smile

    ive heard poor jokes in my time he
said  but none as bad as that

  that brought osborne out of his chair as
though he were a bouncing ball  he flung

open the bronze gateway and said  beat

it

  the wanderer looked into the bankers
half-shut eyes for a half minute swapping
him glare for glare he looked so hard that
as he backed out of the gate he bumped
into some one and whirling saw that he
was facing mrs osborne back of her was
kitty flushed from the nip of the cold
northwest wind wearing fallen-leaf brown
with a small terra cotta hat pulled down
over her brow and ears

  at sight of them something had occurred
to osborne for he reached out and seizing
springtime by the arm dragged him back
into the inclosure then spoke a few words
to his wife and to kitty-words which
came to the wanderer muffled and distant
osborne swung open a glazed door marked
 directors room and when he had
ushered his wife and kitty within pushed
the unresisting springtime after them

  mrs osborne instinctively chose the
chairmans place and came to rest there as
a full rigged ship comes to anchor kitty
took a place close to a window with her
back t the light where she could look at
springtime who stood near the middle of
the long table when they were all within
osborne shut the door and advanced to
the head of the table and pointed a short
finger at springtime

   do you know what that damned fool
has just done he said  do you after
getting around the dismalest job that man
ever undertook and showed that after all
he had some sense he turned down a prop-
osition that any man in the village between
the ages of nine and ninety would have
jumped at i offered to put him to work
at anything he wanted and he knows what
that means turned it down-after get-
ting five cents more a bushel for beans than
any man in the history of the world ever
did get and now he says he is going back
to the railroads to get himself beaten up by
fly cops can you beat it

  springtimes eyes which had wandered to
osborne when the banker began to speak
turned toward kitty but he could make
nothing of her face for the reason that she
the bird of passage



stood in the shadow never had her half

of him loved her more but never had his
wild half so thirsted for freedom and the
third part of him the common sense part
of him told him that in the end she would
be happier without him than with him for
he-a blowed-in-the-glass stiff-could never
keep her in fallen leaf-tweeds

   the wild goose said kitty softly with
her eyes fixed on springtime

  she was thinking of the time she had first
seen him and the change that work and
good living had brought in him he was
thinner and paler and his eyes while still
humorous had lost their hard look spring-
time carried himself differently just as dur-
kin carried himself differently still there
was something touching in that change as
there always is in any change from wildness
to uniformity and kitty feeling it said

 the wild goose  again very softly

  mrs osborne looked at springtime and
her nearsighted eyes were blurred with ten-
derness it was exactly the same sort of
look she took on when she was feeding
archie

   why not she said  why should he
stay for some there is one kind of living
and for others another kind of living every
man must work out his own destiny-and
he has shown that there are many chances
for doing good among the sort of men he
will meet we shall miss him but we shall
give him god-speed

   well it beats me said osbome and
pounded the table with his fist  why do
you suppose a man wants to stand up when
he can sit down-why sleep on the ground
when he can sleep in a bed-want to ride
the bumpers when he can ride the cushions
it must be a kind of insanity now see
here springtime theres plenty of excite-
ment in the kind of life i lead tell me
straight-didnt you get some out of that
bean job after all-i mean the idea of float-
ing a loan to get money for your engine
and then selling them a little above the mar-
ket didnt you get any fun out of that
 no said springtime in a low voice
 not one damned little bit	

  osborne threw up his hands

youre past me young fellah ive
seen many in my time but never one like

you hang it yo look like a gentleman
and talk like one a whole lot more than
i do and you have gray matter but still

youre foot-loose 

   ive never denied it said springtime

wearily

  it was all getting to be too much for him
he was crazy to be gone kitty moved
over and slipped her arm through her

fathers

   hed stay if he could she said  you
dont understand but i do he has to go
and it would be worse than silly for him to
stay as long as he has to go suppose he
did stay he would always be thinking about
roaming let him go and get it out of his
system as they say and then if ever he
should want to come back-

  she looked at springtime who had been
following her lips as though he were deaf
it was hard but it was easier to have her
feel that way

  kitty in a directors room was like a
rose in a foundry but there was a connec-
tion for it was through that directors room
that she managed to wear fallen-leaf browns
he nodded to her unable to speak and
knew that no matter how long or how far
he roamed still the thought of kitty would
always be a sweet pain he took a step
forward and at that movement osbome in
a rage balled his fist

   you know i still have something on
you i could keep you in this town until
you rot-if i wanted to and dam me if
i dont think i want to sometimes when a
man wont do the thing thats good for him
its a kindness to make him do it i have
enough on you on account of that hold-up
to hold you here and sure id like to

  mrs osborne turned in her chair and
caught her husbands eye she adjusted
her glasses so that she could get a clear look
at him and let him have the full benefit of
a near-sighted glare

   dont be absurd

  baffled osbome looked at kitty ah
shook her head and said  its no use old-
timer

  the old man surrendered and springtime
saw that it was time to go he roused
himself from a near coma into which he had
fallen and put out his hand to osbome

    youve been square to me he said  in
some ways not all im thanking you for
not being any harder than you were

  osborne shook his head and flourished
his hands but did not speak or offer to
return the grip springtime turned to his
wife who gave him a double hand clasp

    good-by dear boy she said  after
all everything is usually for the best isnt
it if only we have faith and trust to the
good things come out right in the end
if ever you come to our home again you
will find-

  slim mccabe bellowed osborne
 get out

   springtime turned to kitty but no words
would come he fumbled in his pocket and
brought out the envelope into which he
had counted her wages and held it out to
her

    your pay he said  kitty-

  with her eyes on his she took the en-
velope slipped it in a pocket then put both
of her arms about his neck and kissed him
square on the lips then let him go without
a word springtime backed out of the
door step by step and swung it shut on the
tableau of starry-eyed kitty with her hands
pressed to her lips while her father and
mother stunned sagged on either side of
her

chapter xxv

the traitor

he found durkin in the general meeting
hall of the mission some of the glass
doors had been swung shut so that
the convert sat within a comparatively small
chamber in the center of which a round
stove burned almost red-hot with his feet
on the fender and his head tipped back
durkin could have posed for a picture of
bachelor comfort if only he had been al-
lowed a cigar cigarette or pipe

  springtime drew out a cigarette as he
slumped into a chair near his pal but dur-
kin put up a warning finger and pointed
with his thumb over his shoulder he heard
a faint feminine bustle on the other side
of the partition and saw a skirted shadow
looming and fading behind durkin he

put the cigarette back and looked his friend
over and that look told him that durkin
would have to make a few changes before
they really began to travel he was wearing
a still different suit and a pair of patent
leather shoes with cloth tops-in them his
long aristocratic feet looked very well but
they would never do for straddling bumpers

   gee durk said springtime  where
did you get the swell pair of kicks

   kicks said durkin wrinkling his
brows  thats criminal slang for shoes
ive heard if that is what you mean they
are a rather good pair

  springtime laughed soundlessly and
jerked a thumb over his shoulder in the gen-
eral direction of california

    im drifting he said in a low voice
 how about it

   by some mysterious process all the stiff-
ness and respectability melted out of dur-
kin and as he leaned forward in his chair
with a glance over his shoulder his steel-
gray eyes were as bright as pin points

   when he asked cautiously

   pronto as soon as i can get down to
the yards and hook a rambler then i
dont stop till i get to the coast durk
he said tensely as he gripped the others
knee  youve heard it said that i was a
real traveler havent you well ive never
done any moving compared to what im go-
ing to do you and me are holding down
every fast train between here and frisco in
spite of hell and jeff carr are you with
me

   durkins thin nostrils expanded

    so youre drifting he said dreamily
 youre on the wing good old spring-
time mulligans and hangouts and bulls
chasing you through railroad yards and
saps and all the rest of it good gosh

    thats the boy durk said springtime
still holding him by the knee  youre too
good for this sort of thing you can chuck
those swell togs in the first town we come
to and get a good piece of change for them
too you and i dont belong in this sort
of life-were travelers tramps royal and
willbe all our lives we can be on our
way in half an hour

   durkin bent his head and for five minutes
neither said a word and in that silence
the bird of passage



springtime heard the faint continuous rus-
tling on the other side of the glassed par-
tition a womans voice began a song-a
soft soprano voice humming a gospel tune
and at that sound durkin slowly settled
back in his chair straightened his color
pulled his cuffs down around his wrists and
was once again durkin gentleman and
prize convert of the star of life mission
he shook his head and his eyes begged for
mercy

   i cant he said in a whisper  i cant
the fact is that im going to be married

 married  cried springtime as he
sprang to his feet  durk you snitcher
 srsjrf said durkin for the song had
stopped  dont shout so jolly loud old
chap

  he caught springtime by the wrist and
forced him down into his seat where the
wanderer sat betrayed crestfallen for un-
til that bad moment he had not realized how
much durkin had been figuring in his plans
for the future whenever his wild self had
begun to scheme for the good days to come
durkin had always been there and all those
good times were to be doubled by the pres-
ence of the tall man without him life
looked gray and uninteresting

  durkin shook down the stove and poured
some more coal into it all the time casting
glances at springtime which showed that he
felt his own shame keenly he arranged
the dampers to the sixteenth of an inch and
said  shes a good soul

   she has coin said springtime bitterly
and while durkin winced a bit he showed
no signs of anger

   thats what started me he said  but
thats not what finished me it wouldnt
make any difference now id go ahead with
it anyway and winters coming spring-
time winters coming and even in cali-
fornia winter is winter take a tip from a
wise guy and settle down

   what are you going to do when you
get fed up demanded springtime as he
indicated the gloomy comers of the mission
 you cant stand this very long a man
cant swear off roaming all of a sudden any
more than he can swear off dope all of a
sudden durk youve got to taper

  for a half second durkin looked panicky

and springtime knew he had touched upon
a hidden fear

   were going to travel springtime
were leaving as soon as the jolly old knot
is tied and when i come back i trust that
things will be different travels very
broadening and i dont want you to get
the idea old boy that im doing this for
the money thats in it because im not

at first yes but now no she has much in
addition springtime there isnt an ounce
of meanness in that womans nature-at
least not more than an ounce and whats
more i havent any other wives over the
country not even a widow

  he finished in a confiding whisper and
springtime felt his anger evaporating under
the smooth mans words but durkin had
no more than finished than that panicky
look came back in his face and he looked
over his shoulder all their talk had been
in whispers but he sank his voice still lower
and said  all the same a man might get
fed up even with perfection youll promise
to drop me a line every two or three weeks
and let me know where you are and then
ill get a leave of absence to go on a business
trip and well roam for a month-say next
spring i have it springtime i have it-a
scheme that will settle it for both of us
you get something soft here for the winter
a job picking beans or something like that 
and then in the spring well start out for a
ramble of a month or two i could probably
get you a job through this outfit hows
that

  springtime shook his head firmly

   no ive got to beat it now ive got
to

  from behind the glass partition came a
gentle call  thomas

  durkin looked at springtime with a
queer baffled expression in his eyes and
rising slipped through a door

  springtime did not wait for him to re-
turn he got up and went into the street
which seemed empty cold and forlorn if
durkin had been at his side or kitty that
street would have been glorious but he
needed one or the other the northwest
wind had freshened and poured down the
street in a cold damp stream he pulled
his coat over his throat and headed for


argosy-allstory weekly

 the railway yards-it was a shame about
 durk for somehow or other he had come
 to stand for that wild half of him that loved
 all things in tramp life its humor its ir-
 responsibility its hardships its queer in-
 tangible rewards his defection was a stag-
 gering blow and instead of looking forward
 to his long jump across two-thirds of a con-
 tinent with pleasure springtime looked for-
 ward to it as something of a job that was
 bound to be uncomfortable if a true pal
 ever lived it was durkin and he felt deep
 in his heart that he who had wandered
 all these years without a true companion
 had found one only to lose him to a mission
 and a widow

    springtime cut through a clump of ware-
  houses and crawled through a hole in a fence
  and into the railway yard he knew that
  there was a vardmasters office in the mid-
  dle of that fan of tracks and that there
  was a chalked bulletin on the outside of it
  showing the schedule of trains locating
  the little gray-green structure he walked
  toward it and so long had he been out of
  hobo life that when a bellow sounded from
  the far end of the yard-a bellow that said
   git you son of a toad he did not con-
  nect it in any way with himself

    it was only when he saw a brakeman
 grinning from the top of a moving string
  of box cars that the old instinct awoke and
 looking behind him he saw the great slim
 mccabe tearing down between the tracks
 with his sap dangling from one wrist

    springtimes response was automatic-
 he sprinted for the first open space he saw-
 a break in the six-foot board fence through
 which ran a pair of tracks he saw that in
 addition to his other talents mccabe was a
 sprinter he was no mean runner himself
 but he could tell by the sound of feet in
 the cinders that the constable was gaining
 on him he flashed through that opening
 and found himself in a perfect cul-de-sac
 a long strip of side track for storing coal
 cars with a six-foot board fence on each side
 of it and two strands of barbed wire on top
 of the six-foot fence

    he could neither dodge nor stop so he
  gathered all his forces and went straight for
  the fence leaping he caught the top and
  his feet hammered against the sides until

they stuck on a resinous knot and he sailed
clean over the top and as he hung poised
there for a fraction of a second he saw that
not only had mccabe stopped running but
that he was laughing and slapping one huge
hand against his thigh he had just time
in which to wonder what he was laughing
at then found out for he came down in a
ditch filled with water-six feet of cold
crusted water

   he broke through that crust of fairy ice
as if it had been thin glass and went down
and down over his head until his feet struck
mud and stuck there half wading half
swimming he floundered to the shore and
as he pulled himself out into the biting wind
he still heard the shouts of merriment com-
ing from the other side of the fence

   springtime pulled himself out and shook
himself without saying a word for he had
no words that would possibly fit the occa-
sion he kicked about a peck of black mud
from each foot and began to run and did
not stop until he was back at the star of
life mission durkin received him without
amazement when he saw his condition he
went to a cupboard and brought back coat
and trousers neatly pressed and arranged
on hangers shirt underclothes even shoes

    i have three suits he said casually
 you can change here where its warm
shes gone

  while springtime warmed himself into
a glow with the towel and dressed durkin
spread his wet clothes over the backs of
mission chairs and placed them near the
stove to dry his sympathy was perfect
for he said not a word while springtime
was changing and when he had clothed
himself anew he threw open the door of the
stove and offered his guest a cigarette
then when springtime had lighted up he
began to feel it possible to talk about what
had happened to him

    a bull chased me over a fence he com-
plained  all i was doing was walking
across the freight yards and some guy
yelled hit the grit you son of a toad
and i looked around and here was mccabe
with a sap after me if it had been any-
body else i would have faced it out but not
with him ill bet he had a pair of brace-
lets in his pocket and a blackjack on his
the bird of passage



 hip i simply hit the grit and ran like i
 never did run before i came to a six-
 foot fence and i went over it like a bird
 but on the other side was a ditch full of
 water durk its an outrage youd think
 this country was germany the way these
 cops carry on something ought to be done
 about it

   there was a faint light of amusement in
 durkins eyes but he controlled his merri-
 ment until he saw a corresponding laugh in
 springtimes eye and then the two joined in
 laughter that became almost a yell when
 they thought of the second part of spring-
 times joke the first being that he had been
 soused in water and the next being that
 any hobo should think about legal redress
 durkin lighted a twist of paper in the fire
 and they smoked like boys at boarding
  school hunched up and blowing the telltale
 smoke up the chimney where the draft
 sucked it up and it disappeared without
 trace

    springtime said durkin  do you
 know what it is that keeps chaps like you
 and me chained to the road its because
 theres always something to laugh at i
 havent had a good laugh since ive been in
 this town until you came in just now
 thanks for that one i remember one time
 when i was ditched away off in the desert
 and i slogged it to a little place where there
 was a water tank and nothing else i got
 there in the middle of the day and it was so
 hot that you could have fried eggs on the
 rails i went over to the tank to rest in
 what shade there was and there was a
 bindle stiff fast asleep gee he wyas a
 crumb i never did see such a wreck-
 fourteen toes sticking out of each shoe and
 hed been sleeping in the same hat for years
 but he was dreaming sweet dreams and
 he would smile and smile and all of a sud-
 den he said  sixty days and sat up

     i asked him what it was all about and
 when he finally got it through his head that
 he had been dreaming and this water tank
 was real life he told me that in his dream
 he was a judge  i dreamed i was a beak
 he said  and a swell was fetched up before
 me for breaking the speed laws and i
 says to him  whats your name and he
 says  percy rockerbilt  where do you

live i asked him and he says  oh paris
new york palm beach anywhere  what
do you do for a living i asks him and he
says maddern hell  nothing im a gen-
tleman   well says i  since you dont
live no place and dont have no job it is the
opinion of the court that youre a common
vag sixty days  

  springtime and durkin doubled up with
laughter-silent laughter as though it were
bootleg stuff and there was a revenue officer
just outside the door there was a wistful
look in durkins eyes and a wistful feel in
springtimes heart durkin put his hand on
his pads knee and nodded mysteriously as
though reminding him of an appointment
he was likely to forget

   in the spring bo he said  in the
spring from that their talk turned to
other things than roaming for it was a ten-
der subject and too sacred for that dark
mission one doesnt speak of a dear dead
friend in a boiler factory

  when springtimes clothing had dried
durkin the universal genius hunted up a
flat iron and did a good job of pressing them
on the table where in hard times that
might in some future centuries to come fall
upon napoleon the soup line would be
served when that was done he pulled out
a gold watch and slipping it back in his
pocket said  its almost five-have you
any place to spend the night

  springtime said vaguely  i dont know

   ill be back about eight and if you
arent better suited old fellow by that time
i can fix you up a flop here that wont be
so bad do you need any money for chow

  springtime shook his head for in his
pocket was pasquales good money durkin
put on a good overcoat and a derby hat and
walked to the door where he turned and
said again  in the spring bo in the
spring 

  after he had gone springtime sat for a
time until the dark smell about him-a
smell made up of the scent of old hymn
books old carpets old soup old walnut
chairs-drove him to the street once there
he began to wander aimlessly feeling like
the small boy who has sworn to run away
from home and finds himself at dark with-
out the courage to go ahead or come back

  kittys half had gained enormously since
the cold bath and it drew his aimless feet
down the alley which he had traversed a
short month ago for the first time he
found himself standing just where he had
stood when he first saw her behind the
syringas where the smell of the mince pies
on the window sill had stopped him dead
as the scent of woodcock would stop a bird
dog peering down the alley he saw that
the stable door was closed and walking to it
also saw that it was locked

  he had had a curious idea of going back
into that tin shed and starting on the sec-
ond twenty bushels for it might be that
kitty or tom osborne would come in there
at five or a little after and on that familiar
ground he could get over the shame of the
meeting but that door was locked tight
and he turned back-cold miserable home-
less-and stared into the strip of murky
splendor in the west the lawn was full
of chill misty light and the northwest
wind sang in the sere shrubbery and the
weathercock on the roof pointed unswerv-
ingly toward seattle or portland or some
of the other places where he ought to be

  then far above him he heard a faint
confused cry-a cry like the sound of a
pack of hounds heard over a dozen ridges
of hills springtime listened with his head
back trying to locate it trying to under-
stand what it was-then a resounding honk
from archie told him that it was the cry of
wild geese on their way south-the inde-
scribable romantic clamor of his brothers
of the air as he peered into the northwest
he could just make out the pattern of them
-a long slant line with its tip bent back
like a broken lance springtime vaulted the
fence and raced across the lawn for in some
ways mrs osbornes whole life had been
shaped just for this moment-the moment
when archie should be free to wing his way
up to his brothers in the sky

  the messenger bolted up the steps
opened the door and shouted in

   the wild geese theyre coming over
now 

  he caught a glimpse of mrs osbornes
startled face behind a tea urn and saw two
visitors turn their heads at the interruption
mrs osborne clutched at her glasses and

heaved herself to her feet saying  oh
my good heavens she dashed out onto
the porch and from there ran across the
lawn peering upward and trying to see the
pattern of wild geese archie had his neck
thrust out of the bars of his coop and was
doing curiously limber things with it as he
looked up into the sky

   his long beak opened and closed and the
yard was full of his brazen clamor but the
clear cries which he sent heavenward were
somewhat blurred by the indian meal the
evening ration of which had just been set
before his coop he would look up and
call and then sink his head up to the eyes
in the warm mess then look up again and
the coop trembled at his struggles

   the lady of the house had put ineffectual
hands on the structure that housed him and
was tugging at it already the pattern of
geese was directly overhead so that when
archie looked up there was a backward
bend in his neck their melancholy chorus
came straight down

  free him cried mrs osborne and
kicked at the coop  set him free

   springtime kicked it over with one blow
and archie was free he stood peering up-
ward for a second honked stretched him-
self up on his toes and spread his great
wings slowly he moved them soft whis-
tling things that swept up small feathers
and set them whirling his mistress stood
by him raising her hands and letting them
fall as though she would waft him upward
murmuring inarticulate words of encourage-
ment

   there was no doubt that the broken wing
was healed and more and more rapidly
archie fanned the air until he rose a yard
off the ground and hung there for a mo-
ment then he came down as gently as
thistledown and although his loud clear
voice proclaimed him king of geese he trun-
dled across to his platter and sank his beak
into it up to the eyes the flock was drift-
ing south rapidly and as their clamor be-
came more and more distant archie seemed
loth to let them go-once again he got a
foot or two off the ground but seemed un-
able to hold his gains

  always he came back to the platter of
commeal and springtime who began to see
the bird of passage



that there were implications in the situation
which would be humorous drifted off to the
shelter of a syringa bush where if he could
not control his laughter it would not offend
that philanthropic soul who still stood with
her arms following archies movements still
uttering sounds of encouragement but be-
ginning to look blank as the wild geese
dropped down toward the south and archie
remained on the lawn

  at last the bird gave it up he made his
decision in favor of civilization and squat-
ting down before his plate gave himself over
to wholehearted enjoyment of it mrs os-
borne looked blank until hearing some one
laugh she turned and walked rapidly to-
ward the house

  springtime had whirled at the sound of
that delicious chuckle and found that kitty
had appeared from somewhere-kitty who
with her eyes alight and her hand over her
mouth was trying to keep down unseemly
merriment when mrs osborne had gone

springtime dropped the coop over archie
and the two laughed until they were weak-
so weak that kitty had to be within the

curve of his arm for support

  after a time their merriment subsided

kittys into a wise little smile springtimes
into a wide-eyed stare at the warm orange
lights that had come on within the house
the rays from the windows shot out into the
gloomy windy yard where they seemed to
coagulate and settle into a warm nimbus
about springtime and kitty springtime
bent and touched her lips with his but as
he raised his head his wilder half rallied
for one last stand

   in the spring bo he said softly  in
the spring 

  kitty looked up and the wise little smile
broadened a bit

   yes dear she said

  and to mix metaphors  yes dear ut-
tered in just that tone has been the swan
song of many a wild goose

                 the end

   u	u	t

     women versus nature

 yyhen nature started on the job she didnt grab the outside knob

  and slam the door and hurry home before her work was done

 she merely did the best she could and when she found the job was good

 she dressed the animals and birds and loosed them one by one

                                

 in gorgeous hues she clothed the males-the birds with fancy wings and tails-
 she made them handsome to the eye in color and physique

 the male must stand the greater test and so dame nature thought it best
 no doubt that probably was it to make the female weak

 the lion and the kangaroo the peacock and the cockatoo

 she clothed in raiment rich and fine-the females drab and plain

 she spotted up the leopard male she striped the tiger plumed the quail

 and handed all the female kind the honor and the pain

 the human female only sees dame nature as a piece of cheese-

 shes switched the system all about and thinks no more of then

 the now is hers-shes grabbed the clothes and so with powder on her nose
 she turns it up some nine degrees wheneer she talks of men

 oh nature how we need thee now the farmerettes have grabbed the plow
 theyve swiped our jobs and trades and arts-theyve taken every chance

 oh nature in your hour of ease-or any other time you please-

 come hurry on the job again while were yet wearing pants

                                                                miles overliolt

french louey grew restless with
the approach of frosty nights he
jingled his rawhide bag of gold from
wolf bounties and hides listening absently
to the tune it rang his throat half formed
the moose call as he pawed the ground with
his moccasins a longing for the wild in his
blood

   by gar he grunted  time for me
to ru-un for de green timber 

  keen frost lays the gloss on guard hair
of mink and otter it starts the fur of mar-
ten fox pekan and all the land animals
to coming prime the hardwoods let their
gay colored leaves flutter to earth while
the spruce and balsam glaze with bright
reflections from the evergreen of their nee-
dle leaves

   time for me to smoke meat jerk veni-
son the old trapper grinned the scatter-
ing bristles on his leathery cheeks standing
out like silver wires  firstest i know
zat souwest wind lay me by gull rocks
maybe till i freeze up no chance it-
come now you lazy scoundrel come-
hi-it hi-i

  french louey complained in bitter words
but with twinkling eyes of the fate that

dragged him each autumn from talking
birches a buxom breed at st ignac and
from another friend mrs wustane both
of whom he had courted in vain but amus-
ingly from age to age

  then he dropped in on captain argyle
of the fish tug little st ignac ran in to
see the dampier boys lying at black river
mouth he danced ashore on limber
springy legs and he was pitched about and
tossed in his wonderful old sailboat between
squalls as he scurried in and out down the
coast of the north superior shore paying
his respects

   by gar he grumbled  i don lak
de looks not a beet of dat blue cloud down
by the souwest ba-a-hi-i

  on some days with a sweep and a swish
the blue-cloud would make a grab but he
would duck around a point or under the
lee of something or other cackling at the
squall that he just felt in the hair on the
back of his neck the blowt goneby he
would go slipping out laughing and jeering
the vanity of squalls and from the horizon
the dark swells of the  windy mists  would
reach up and draw back-for he knew
them knew their nature read their will to

 a


french loueys delay



   engulf him as he knew the north shore

   east end and the green timber

    thus he arrived at blue jay harbor he
sailed in with his red canvas spread to the
western zephyrs and a slant of a golden
setting sun casting his long pointed shadow
in purple ahead of him he sang the mad
joy in his heart holding his tiller with one
hand shaking his jingle-gold at the stone
along the waters edge and toward the tall
slim spruces firs and graceful silver birches

    i come-e he cried u french louey
come-e hi-i sons o groons wolfs
look out-an dis tarn ol boy i bet i jerk
yo into sevum hunder pound of venison

i bet-t dis tarn i do eet

   wolves he detested hated and delighted
in toward moose he had a different feel-
ing which he regarded with amusement and
exultation the moment he heard the keel
scrape on the gritting sand of the landing
he pranced ashore with a kind of spidery
jump making fast with a line but stopping
in a blank amazement as six or eight gor-
geous bluejays puffed out in their winter
plumage swarmed into overhanging
branches and began to scold

   they screamed jeered chirruped whis-
tled and spread the alarm of his arrival
until the chickerees back in the evergreens
began to call and two or three ruffed
grouse took up the alarm nervously and
flew away with the subdued roar of their
kind

   dar yo go french louey cried in
anguish tam plue jays scare all de
game all de meat anywhere an now where
i shoot my jerk eh what i live on dis
wintaire if i dont jerk de moose

  he turned a gaze of malignant joy and
delighted indignation at the flock of birds
he walked along the sand peering and
stretching his neck sure enough a few
rods distant he came upon a track on the
loose grit some great brute had trampled
there taking long steps and plowing heavi-
ly amid the scattering fall of autumnal
leaves

    dats heem all right french louey
shook his head  the son of a goon he
mak sevum hunder pound of jerk i keel
heem an look i get fat on my ribs like a
-oh like a bull moose mebby mebby

   	a

too i grow me a pair of yellow horns so

beeg by gar i have a stiff neck here
he is yet an you blue scoundrels wat

de tuner yo tell heem i come for hi-i
by gar i feex yo sons o goons

  he went rushing back to his boat he
scrambled aboard he dashed into the
cabin he snatched up a  caliber re-
peater emerged with it gesticulating and
began to flash the muzzle up and down
he made so many strange motions that the
flock of blue jays lowered their voices and
withdrew a yard into the fringe of the brist-
ling green timber

  now look t french louey sighed

 wen i pull down on em dey ain no
more in sight by gar i feex em 

  he laid the little rifle to one side and
began to prance ashore and about he was
a most absurd figure he threw himself
spread himself preened and posed perked
up and strutted about-he seized now an
ax tossed next a bundle manhandled his
supplies fairly danced to tunes that he
whispered or whistled under his breath

  he paused to receive upon his finger a
bumpy tubby soft-eyed chickadee as an
old friend and presto out of the ruins rose
a beautiful tiny log cabin out of the raw
wilderness appeared a trappers camp and
back under the wilderness canopy was a
flash of bright yellow as large as the mans
small hand the fresh blaze that marked
the line french louey followed into the
green timber with three or four steel traps
to the mile each one laid for marten or
fisher mink or lynx otter or whatever was
at the crossings

  in four days the old man had landed his
outfit in a week he was all snug his boat
hauled out and safe on its pole ways he
scurried into the wilderness clearing his
line of its impeding windfalls dropping
traps at the cubby sites keeping keen
watch for sign and tale of the wilderness
reading the news of his quarry and his
peltry

  for one thing old hang-nose was
around yet toward that bull moose the
trapper bore a particular personal instinc-
tive resentment french louey knew the
old boys hoofprints whether in beach sand
in caribou moss or under the spruces in

the deeps of dark purple dead-fallen ever-
green needles

   you wait yo ol scoundrel  he shook
his dark finger at the heavy gloom beneath
the tree tops  come de time yet wen i
feex yo a - in de lungs maybe or
worse yet in the throat or haid yah
put a good bullet in you an den wat ol
hang-nose will you roar at me--eh-
sh-h-h

  as if answering his challenge he heard
the call of a moose it did not seem so
loud it was not even exactly a heavy
sound yet it made the woods quiver stir-
ring the timber and it seemed as though
the masses of the cliffs and rubbed-down
granite mountains trembled to that grand
and rumbling wilderness music

  french louey rolled his eyes blinked
and sucked in his breath he stood by one
of his white birch bark wigwams cone-
shaped and a beautiful salmon color with
patches of pure white which he had just
built anew on an ancient camp site he
saw on a topmost twig over his head a buck
blue jay a fine fellow in whose feathers
shone the light of day the instant the
mans black eyes discovered the bird the
jay dived from its perch and darted from
yiew among the evergreen thickets

   yeh yeh go tell dat ol feller im
here the trapper shrieked after the bird
shaking his fist  some day i lose my
temper you tellin heem my business so
mooch yeh i feex you-den heem
sevum hunder poun of jerk-dats wat i
get sh-h french louey yo keep yo
mout shut-con say nottin to-morrow
-to-morrow 

  that night the big moose roared his chal-
lenge and uttered his love call french
louey listened to the sound he knew that
voice he had heard it during other au-
tumns he knewr that as yet the old bull
was lonely and that there had been no an-
swer to soothe the wild longings to assuage
the terrible loneliness that made for misery
while attaining to the heights of love-lorn
iecstasy the trapper too had sung songs
had uttered challenges had memories of
successes iong ago before there had come
jthe slow but sure passing of his own day

   shut up  he whispered from his bal-

sam boughs as he was wrapped in woven
rabbit-skin blanket  shut up when i
hear you i think of me you wait-to-
morrow i feex you to-morrow

  he meant it before dawn he was cook-
ing a pair of grouse over a green birch fire
he had his cup of tea he warmed his
carbine over the fire and drew on his gloves
as at false dawn he issued into the frosty
glow of stars about to fade

  he had in mind the killing of a great
moose to jerk the meat to convert the skin
into snowshoes and thongs and perhaps to
sell the horns and head for a hundred dol-
lars at port arthur for the next fall rush
of hunters seeking trophies

  he left his trap line blazed through the
wilderness swung south into a burning
and skirted the tangle of briers to follow
along a bog of moss with half-drowned
trees looking at the tracks there which told
how truly he had found his way to the
scene of the lonely bulls stamping ground
french louey held his forefinger in his
mouth for a minute and when the tip was
well wet and warmed he held it in the air
over his head it grew cool toward the
west first

  hi-i the hunter grimaced were
dat ol boy go les see

  he found where browse had been nib-
bled moss had been tom away in wads
brush broken by huge horns wrestling with
it ground pawed by big hoofs he read
the signs and tracks found the heavy foot-
steps which showed the direction of the
moose when he took his departure and saw
on the trees where massive homs had
bumped the bark rubbing it with his rifle
grasped in both hands thumb on hammer
stepping with still moccasins the hunter
gave chase

   i catch de ol scoundrel asleep  he
whispered exultingly to himself  den
by gar in two secons he wake up-an i
don care-hi-i

  sunrise was now at hand the golden
lights tipped the bare knobs of stony moun-
tains and made the tops of the evergreens
gleam with silver and emerald waves of
relief from the black night frost came in
warmth across the landscape a chickadee
uttered a tentative chirp a wren made re-
french loueys delay



  ply and a chickeree whispered low with
nerves on edge then squarely over french
loueys head there was a shake of a branch
a voice broke with rasping shrillness on
the quiet

   wan-n-n-nh 

  french louey froze in his tracks cold
chills ran down his back his inouth

opened his eyes bulged his ears worked
and his boney hands closed down on his
stock and barrel

   sacrc he gasped  dat tamn plue
scoundrel blue jay-i feex-

  he threw his rifle up as he did so the
blue jay flitted a rod into the mass of ever-
greens and began to scream call whisper
and jeer the cry of alarm was taken up
far and wide by red squirrels and other
jays and a flock of chickadees in the jo-
vial innocence of their companionable
hearts came to join the excitement one of
them came plumping down onto the brim
of french loueys hat and tipped over to
look upside down into his eyes

  the man heard a faint crash he heard
a rattle of horns on standing timber he
heard a branch break he heard not a hun-
dred yards distant the moose racing
through the close-growing trunks

   der he goes french louey gasped
in two minutes i catch heem by gar
old hang-ntose gone-i t ank you mee-
staire plue jay oh yeh i tank you
he turned to storm homeward to his trap
line camp and arriving there he sat mo-
rosely for hours by the stick-fed fire in his
wigwam when at last he bobbed out to
fell some white birch and block them off
for winter firewood he muttered and cursed
under his breath while he slammed the
splitting blade in deep or sent the cutting
edge into the soft white wood he glow-
ered at the visiting chickadees and threw
chips at the impudent red squirrels he
sighed with angry appreciation at the blue
jays and whisky jacks which came bobbing
and pirouetting around

  dat op hang-nose  the trapper
gasped  nex tarn by gar

  he had his trap line to lay down for his
business of life he scurried through the
woods dropping a trap at each old cubby
or stopping to build a new one where in-

stinct or memory bade him pause for sake

of a fisher mink or marten he returned

to the range of old hang-nose his cached

traps all taken up and distributed his old
lines cut out and his new loops run and
blazed light of pack grim of visage sav-
age of intentions he went ransacking the
valley of boiling springs for the big moose

    i need dat meat he said reckless of
the rabbits grouse and fish which he had
hung up  nothing lak bull moose to mak
a man strong

  he found and followed the big fellows
tracks they led through open burning
across springy swamps of caribou moss
through ridge gaps and into windfall where
the down timber was laid in heaps-top on
top french louey paused at the thicket
which covered acres he sat down to
scratch his chin he whispered to himself
then he heard a crackle of dead sticks a
crash of breasted timber he sprang to his
feet sprang to a sloping spruce trunk and
ran agilely to see the better

   he saw a great black figure with bright
yellow antlers of enormous spread with
tawny legs plowing through the tumble-
down tops with a cackling shriek he
threw up his carbine but even that slight
wreight cost him his balance he tipped
tilted wavered with both hands and a foot
sprawling in the air against the sky line
then he fell ignominiously into the bent
limbs of an underlying balsam twelve or
fifteen feet beneath

   sacref sacre he squealed  par
bleau-hi-i by gar

   barked shins insulted dignity and side-
long embarrassment settled upon french
louey in equal proportions old hang-
nose was a devil he was a wizard he was
malignant like a carcajou and he was in
league with the laughing jays no use try-
ing to bother with such a scalawag as that
the trapper slunk away back to his own
line and quietly shot a yearling bull dressed
out the meat slit it into foot-long ropes
and salted them in layers on the inside of
the short-haired skin

  after two days in which the meat took
up the salt he washed the a kali from the
strips piece by piece he swung the meat
on long slender sticks which in turn he

laid on a stout frame work under the
sticks he spread a depth of six inches of
white birch and maple green body wood
the heat cooked the meat as the fat
dripped and the coals ashed over french
louey laid on strips of green wood as large
as his finger which burned without smoke
after four hours the meat stopped dripping
it was cooked

   dar  the trapper grimaced i got
my jerk i ask no odds of dat ol son of a
gun hang-nose dont starve me to death
-not this winter i fool heem dataway

  the trapper strode over the big hoof-
prints with high disdain - ignoring them
when he heard the old boy romping through
the timber hitting the trees with his huge
horns the trapper sniffed indifferently
when he saw a strange cow moose come
into the range a strong brute with a bell
of her own the old trapper put his hand
up beside his face to look away again

   so dats eet eh to-night ill listen
eh

  that night he listened but only for a
while he stared into the fire of the bark
wigwam full of thoughts of his own he
heard the old bulls call he heard the cows
answer-the first and only one to reply to
old hang-xose that fall as the trapper felt
sure for weeks the old fellow had been
raising his voice to the sky had lowered
his mouth to the ground-and now his call
was answered now his longings were re-
ciprocated

   so french louey said  by gar-
hi-i

  politely he rolled up in his blanket
pulled the rabbit fur about his ears and
went to sleep a week later he saw the two
a quarter of a mile away across a lake whose
shores were fringed with ice he was in a
cluster of balsam where he was swinging a
lynx snare for minutes he watched the
two magnificent brutes as they grazed along
side by side

  too tam bad he grumbled now
i have all dat young bull jerk-i am not
to waste heem-huh mebby by and by

  snow fell the evergreens were bur-
dened the opens were spread with the soft
blanket the briers ferns and light weeds
flattened to the ground the tracks of all

wild life led hither and yon upon the white
page the great moose and his maid laid

their tracks with those of the others

  pekan ran bounding otter leaped and

slid lynx walked with dignity and foxes
paced about step by step nervous snow-
shoe rabbits bounded and jerked back and
forth and on their multitude great snowy
owls the weasel tribes the foxes and big
cats fed as on the up-starting noisily fly-
ing grouse as well

   french louey caught them with his bul-
lets shooting five whose misfortune he
jeered while he cursed the weights of their
beautiful black and heavy hides he caught
mink and marten sneering at their fierce
unintelligent ways he called otter particu-
larly silly and insignificant though they
were the hardest of all to catch except
wolves toward the tracks of wolves he
crossed he carried himself with vociferous
mockery of respect-and shot two while
they were sleeping on the sunny side of tiny
balsams where they had pawed beds
through the snow to green deep moss

   wolves wolves he chuckled shak-
ing his bag of gold at the limp dangling
gray hides  dar-r fool wolves

  the snow was only a few inches deep
but he carried snowshoes wherever he went
any day the dark leaden clouds might fluff
down in deep waste of heavy snowfall he
made the most of the frisking life that
spread its record in the trackings whoe
footprints he read with such instinctive un
derstanding

   a wraith of the green timber he flitted
hither and yon tending to his terribly ef-
ficient steel traps choking lynx who did
not know what was strangling them pick-
ing up tracks of furs that he knew-here
a certain black-tailed fox-there an otter
with a snaky slide and always when he
came to it turning to follow it for a few
rods however tired he might be along the
trail of old hang-nose or of the big cow
who now ranged his range

  french louey wondered about that bull
moose he would drop on his hands and
knees making sure that the old fellow was
eating a caribou moss and not taking goat-
berry leaves he would reach with a long
stick to examine the tw igs of slender birches
french loueys delay



    where the moose had stood on his hind legs
    to chank the sweet tasty young bark

   now that the urge of need no longer
  drove the trappers trigger finger to the
  carbine guard french louey noted that he
  saw the big moose

 every tarn i look aroun by gar wen
i don need to see m the trapper whis-
pered under his breath when he saw the
black giant stalking along in the gloom of
heavy timber or out in the thin footing
over open moss

   sometimes the two looked each other in
the darkling eye each uncertain of the
others intentions-yet the moose decided
to mind his own business turning to vanish
without haste in whatever cover was con-
venient the cow more shy more reticent
kept clear and seldom loomed in the fore-
ground

   snow followed snow what had been
convenient tracking showing whither the
pekans ran where the mink crossed from
stream to stream was now a deep fluffy
mass against which the broad chest of the
bull moose plowed and in which french
louey lifted high his long raquettes com-
plaining bitterly that he was too old for
such nonsense pausing however to bandy
words with a flock of blue jays or talk
soothingly to some still-living victim in his
pretty cubby ere it had jerked the well-
sweep clear to lift it by a caught paw to
swing hopeless and helpless-a bit of living
fur in its doom

   until new years french louey was all
enwrapped in the best of the years trap-
ping after the sleety thaw of january he
took the leavings of the fag end of the sea-
son working harder he caught less bit-
ter cold meaner snows to combat desperate
storms to weather-he grew weary with his
sustained endurance he saw his quarry
growing gaunt as food grew scarce

 when he met the old moose hang-nose
he saw in the shaggy coat a certain lean-
ness and in the lowering eyes a certain
heaviness of experience the huge antlers
had disappeared having fallen from the
bulls brow leaving odd scars without
them old hang-nose was even a more im-
posing brute with his enormous head his
short neck his high shoulders and his slop-

ing back and comical little tail the cow
remained near too when french louey

happened by the pair he saw the female
drawing away while the old bull interposed

himself in a casual way on his retreat

  hi-i the trapper whispered so
they go-together

  late in february sleet and freeze gripped
the wilderness in crush and misery for
four days french louey was held in one
camp because the snow would not even
support him on his raquettes the freeze
covered the snow with a crust which when
it broke showed edges as sharp and points
as cutting as soft glass

  on his snowshoes he could skip about
skating whither he would he found his
traps catching the wandering meat-eaters
he snared lynx he looked eagerly hop-
ing for bears to come out from their dens
he listened at night for the wandering
wolves whose hunting cry was worst in the
time of crusted snow he carried his rifle
plenty of ammunition and wasted no hours
of light of the lengthening days dread
of the bitter cold of the fanged wilderness
affected even the taunting and buoyant
spirits of the old trapper

  he was glad to come back to blue jay
harbor now the background of the grim
old lake with its floating fields of ice its
splash of blue gray waters and its impassi-
ble barrier was less menacing than the co-
vert of the green timber where the dead cold
oppressed even the habituated toughness of
french louey himself

  he was unafraid he merely wondered
at the voices he heard he merely shrank
when he saw a moving shape out of the cor-
ner of his eye he merely shuddered when in
the sparkling starlit night he heard the
voice of an owl and the far-yelping cry of
the hunting packs

  old hang-nose and the cow had retreat-
ed from some miles inland to the heavy
balsam fir and spruce knoll flats just within
the lakes walls of red stone when french
louey came down to his log cabin in from
the snow-covered hulk of his little sailboat
as it lay drawn out on the beach he found
that the two moose were yarded at his very
door

  dat ol scoundrel he gasped  de

impudence of heem wen i don want
iheem hyar he is wen i want heem
ware is he

  the two had tramped up and down
through the swamp thicket making deep
narrowr paths in the snow they had
walked astride tall slender birch saplings
and having borne down the tops had eaten
the long switch branches they had not
waxed fat but they had lived well com-
pared to some of the gaunt yarded beasts
he had seen in other parts of his trapping
land

  there within a few acres french louey
and the two moose occupied a common
shelter of forest canopy the two brutes
did not welcome him far from it they
plowed away with snorts and heavy blow-
ings but the trapper knewr their tracks
and did not need to see the moose to recog-
nize them

  he sat that night by his little stove with
its chunks of good body-wood warming
his hands while the white frost lining of the
cabin slowly blackened as the heat melted
the tiny crystals leaving instead drips of
water which dried and the wonder of a
warm room in the terrific cold was enjoyed
by the old bones of the man he had at last
so hot a fire that his red stove drove him
to the near wall and when he tried his
breath for the first time in weeks he could
not see it

  hi-i he chirred like a red squirrel
 hi-i

  when he turned in on his bunk which
he had covered a foot deep with shingled
balsam boughs he enjoyed the luxury of
an open blanket with full warmth three
times at intervals of a bit more than an
hour he filled his stove when he awak-
ened the next time it was with a start and
a bound that brought him suddenly to an
erect position

  he listened cocking his head he shiv-
ered as he drew on his heavy shirt before
sticking an ear through an open doorway
when he heard clearly he reached to pick
up his carbine

  by gar he gasped wolves
wolves running-wolves hongry

  starved gaunt wraiths of the arctic cold
driven by famine need of their shrunken

flanks wolves had ceased sneaking and
slinking through the green timber and they
were packed together now while racing in
the open the voices of their hunger whin-
ing as they howled in the star-lit night

    der he whispered  behin de blark
streak ridge-through the gap now-garry
-deyre cornin now down to boiling-
water creek-up-up shu-u

  he knew the ledges from which the
voices echoed he knew the deeps of the
valley gorges where the packs course was
muffled he stiffened as he heard the full-
throated yelling when on a height the pack
gave wide voice to open range

  dev go by french louey assured
himself  dey go on down maybe to
pukaso to pilot harbor problv to dog
river dey go off der

  that was his wish his hope but sud-
denly he heard them utter an outburst of
lust of blood in eager discovery

   wtat wat the trapper gasped
 wat dat

   for a minute he could not guess the an-
swer the pack had found a trail full of
promise which made them thirst the noisier
with famine hope at first he tried to be-
lieve he was mistaken then he thought it
was his own trail-but he knew his trail
was somewhere north of east of the starved
chorus

   by gar he muttered old hang-
nose-hees femme eh parbleau

   french louey stepped into the open all
clear listening the harder he heard the
fearsome thing of that dread wilderness
he heard the wolf pack a numerous and
hungry one coming squealing and yapping
along the track of some victim - french
louey rose on his tiptoes as he saw in his
imagination the thing that was soon to take
place

  old hang-nose was coming plowing
through the snow the sharp crust cutting
him the belled cow was coming too
heavy and slow in that deep tanglefoot
driven by such hunger the wolves could
not easily be held off by even the quick
blows of the long slender legs of the big
bull the cow his mate was in dire need
the trapper blinked staring at the snow
beyond the shadows of his cabin in the
french loueys delay



  starlight he was used to tragic aspects
of the wilderness he was himself-though
he did not say so-one of the most tragic

of all

   sacri he grumbled shrugging his

shoulders dats too bad

  he could do nothing he stood listening
while he heard the wolves in thirsty pur-
suit they came nearer their voices
grew louder he heard them sight their
prey in the starlight he heard their wild
cries of lust and eagerness then he heard
the snarling as the pack closed in he
heard them tumble back yelping and dis-
mayed he heard them whining and mus-
tering their courage again-heard them race
on and then heard another baying heard
another closing in as hunger drove arrant
cowardice to assault in which some must
endure hurts and breaks

  french louey was jumping up and down
he was uttering short cries and making
gesticulations he was beside himself with
gallic excitement as he heard that terrific
but losing fight for life coming nearer the
woods were in an uproar the dark timber
quaking with thunder from the heavy freeze
that split frozen trunks echoed to the
squeals and mouthings of the pack

  then the man could hear the crash of
breaking snow crust he heard frozen
branches as heavy brutes surged through
the dead tops of fallen timber he heard
the heavy breathing the explosive gasps
as the two moose struggled against the
swarming pack of agile grabbing blood-
thirsted wolves

  the moose came plunging nearer the
old bull whipped back the increasing pack
for a minute and suddenly right fairly at
hand the cowt broke cover then the bull
staggered out broadside striking at the
shadowy things swarming around

  hi-i hi-i french louey screamed
and cackled and jumping high reckless of
consequences he dashed the few yards
along the hard path to his smoking little
spring to plunge into the metee

  he threw up his carbine shooting as he
glanced along the side of the short barrel
he saw with satisfaction the red flash of
powder he heard a loud snarl tum into a
howl of frantic grief and agony he threw

seven bullets into the light leaping wraiths
he thrust more shells into the magazine to
empty it again into the gray devils as they
would have conquered

  for half a minute the wolves would not
believe what was happening they tasted
warm blood in their mouths but the most
frantic could not withstand gunfire or the
shrieking triumphant battle-loving human
prancing at them

  the pack vanished in the timber-those
that could go silence fell upon the wil-
derness with a kind of crash the howls
yelps the very whines disappeared french
louey himself grew still he heard gasps
and sighs on the ice of blue jay bay he
saw the two black figures one of which
stood on wind-swept ice beside the other as
she lay sprawled where she had slipped

   huh french louey blinked at the
two  well by gar-r-r-r 

  he returned to his cabin softly closing
the door he stirred the fire put on some
chunks of wood and shivered with cold that
succeeded the perspiration of his rapid
violence

  in the morning just after dawn he
slipped craftily out he saw old hang-
nose and the big cow with crimson icicles
down their breasts and legs walking stiffly
up into the swamp cover again

  the bull turned a pair of small darkly
suspicious eyes in the direction of french
louey who stopped short water pail in
hand the two stared malignantly stead-
fastly full of mutual defiance snorting
softly and even with challenge then the
moose walked with deliberation as suited
the gait of his weary but sale mate with
her burden when they were in the woods
the trapper filled his pail set it in the snow
and then viewed the grisly wretches of the
night hunt as they sprawled in the stained
snow

  one-two-five-six he counted on
his fingers and raising his blackened hands
fistwise at the victims of his natural aim-
ing he swore  i teach you something
trying to rob me of my jerk next fall i
teach you you bet damn gray scoun-

it would be in the nature of a miracle
if either kinkel or kunkel were to go
up  in his lines but if such a surpris-
ing thing should happen there isnt the
slightest doubt that any vaudeville aud-
ience in the country would be able to
prompt them

  the act is as much an institution as the
constitution or the fourth of july more-
over the constitution has been amended
nineteen times while not even the oldest
inhabitant can remember any addition to
or subtraction from the kinkel and kunkel
turn

  they made their debut in the days when
vaudeville was variety and not considered
a respectable form of entertainment its
exponents toiled mostly in beer halls and
dime museums the partners were fond of
referring to the good old times when they

gave ten performances a day for thirty
dollar a week joint and had to share
their dressing room with achoo the trained
seal kuao the missing link and the two-
headed boy

  but thats all past and gone now they
headline at the empress and their salary
runs into four figures

  kinkel is a little fat man who adds to
his embonpoint on the stage with the aid of
a large stomach pad kunkel is tall and
thin and increases his height by wearing
high heels and a built-up wig

  their acting clothes are checks of aston-
ishing pattern and their hats the flattest
of derbies they both sport chin whiskers
and employ a splintered german dialect in
their dialogue there is always a round of
applause when the partners come trotting
out then kinkel says to kunkel

ecmh
the end justifies the means



    who was dot lady i seen you wit jes-
terday

   and kunkel replies

    dot wassnt no lady dots my vife

   then kinkel reaches up and sticks his
thumb in kunkefs eye kunkel retaliates
by kicking kinkel in the stomach kinkel
arises and smites kunkel over the head
with his cane kunkel kisses kinkel lov-
ingly on the forehead and then kicks him in
the stomach again

   is it any wonder the audience shrieks
with laughter at the greatest knockabout
act on the stage

  who can yodel as kinkel does or who
else executes a wooden shoe dance with the
grace and aplomb that is kunkels

   long may they flourish and continue to
delight the refined and intelligent

  now the scylla and charybdis of the
show business are extravagance and the
ladies the thespian mariner who steers
his bark safely between these two perils
can reasonably hope to keep out of the
actors home in his old age

  on the first count the partners were
unanimously acquitted by all their acquaint-
ances as eddie maloney the monologue
man said  either one of them birds makes
harry lauder look like a coal-oil johnnie
indeed he went further and asserted that
if kinkel and kunkel were to be placed
a thousand miles apart and either one
were to spend an unnecessary dollar the
one who did not squander the aforemen-
tioned wealth would immediately experience
a violent attack of heart failure

   there isnt the slightest doubt that they
were a pair of hard-boiled eggs

  darts from feminine eyes glanced from
the couple as harmlessly as peas rattling
on a hippo they had never paid any ali-
mony or breach of promise and they never
under any circumstances bought refresh-
ments or gewgaws for female acquaintances

   but there is no armor so impervious that
cupid cannot find a loose joint for one of
his arrows also it is a well-known fact
that achilles ramped around for many years
before his mushy heel was discovered

   the electric sign in front of the oriental
theater in toronto bore the names of
kinkel and kunkel-and dotty tremaine

  it was die opening matinee of the week
and the comedians were in their dressing-
room busily engaged in donning their pro-
fessional war-paint

    whos the jane thats toppin the bill
with us said kunkel  i never heard of
her

   i dunno responded kinkel  shes
from the other side first week over here
bill macnutt says shes there guess ill
go up an give her the once-over she
closes the first half an we aint on till
after the intermission

  kunkel lit his pipe and engaged in a
game of solitaire while his partner wras in-
specting the new arrival when kinkel re-
turned he was obviously excited

    say that tremaines a panic he said

 she just knocked em out of their seats
an theyve been sittin on their hands all
afternoon till she went on she done three
encores an took six bows an even then they
wouldnt let her go had to throw on the
house lights an start the orchestra to kill
em off i aint seen anybody in years that
can put over a song better an she sure
is a sweet patootie in tights-looks some-
thin like russell did years ago shell be
a riot in new york

  kunkel was rather surprised at kinkels
enthusiasm as that gentleman usually con-
fined his remarks on other performers to
what is professionally known as hammer
throwing however he refrained from any
comment

  that evening kunkel viewed miss tre-
maines act the lady was indubitably a
genuine  trouper she knew how to  put
over  a song in the way that comes only
with years of experience and real ability
also she wore gorgeous costumes and looked
dazzlingly beautiful in the glare of the spot-
light but make-up has been known to
cover a multitude of wrinkles

   she knows her business but she aint
as young as she was some time ago so-
liloquized kunkel

  after the tuesday matinee kinkel sur-
prised his partner by the celerity he dis-
played in getting out of his stage clothes
and into his street habiliment

   whats the excitement he inquired
 puttin on a disappearin demon act


argosy-allstory weekly

   cant a guy be in a hum- without
you openin your yawp demanded kinkel
fretfully then he seized his hat and
exited giving the door a violent slam

  kunkel whistled thoughtfully as he re-
moved the grease paint what ailed kin-
kel why the irritation at this perfectly
natural question

  he was still debating his partners un-
usual conduct as he walked to the hotel
the street was crowded with bundle-laden
shoppers floppers newsboys and the usual
flotsam and jetsam of a big city suddenly
he stiffened like a pointer sighting a covey
of quail right ahead of him was kinkel
and he was with a lady the lady was
dotty tremaine the plot jellies

  kunkel trailed behind the couple and
every few seconds he wiped the perspira-
tion from his brow a man recovers from
the smallpox or a broken leg but falling
for a skirt has put many an empire on the
bum his worst fears were realized when
he saw his quarry enter an eating place
it was the best restaurant in town too

  kinkel was clearly hooked never before
had he been known to purchase food for
anybody but himself and never for himself
in a first-class establishment

  that evening kunkel reached the theater
early and at once made his way to bill
macnutts dressing-room

  mr macnutt was a sturdy man who
had appeared before the public for a number
of years his conversation during perform-
ances was confined to  hup  and u ready
he was the  understander  of  the
bounding macnutts a troupe of acrobats
well and favorably known in both hemis-
pheres probably the fact that he was un-
able to talk while on the stage rendered him
exceedingly voluble when off

   say macnutt began kunkel  you
knew this dotty tremaine over in england
didnt you

    sure i did said bill  i worked with
her at the empire in london an all over
the moss an stoll time that gals some
performer dont see why she didnt come
over here years ago shes gonna mop up
in new york

   kind of a vamp aint she asked
kunkel with affected carelessness

   u no-o-o replied bill judicially  i

wouldnt say shes a vamp shes more
what i call a anaconda shes had four
husbands that i know of probly there
was more always had bad luck with em
one committed suicide another was a ani-
mal tamer an wound up inside a hon the
last one was henry teeters course she may
have got another one since that bein four
years ago you might have knowed this
teeters he was over here bout ten years
ago-played the orpheum time big tall
fellow with a mustache an goatee people
used to turn around an rubber at him he
looked so much like the devil he was one
of the best jugglers in the business billed
himself as bozo the demon prestidigitator
remember him

    dont think i do said kunkel
 where is he now

    thats hard to say near the tail end
 of the war he went over to france with
 one of them entertainment units he was
 walkin down the street one day an the
 dutch dropped a  jack johnson  alongside
 of him when the smoke cleared away
 there was no sign of bozo so people
 naturally figured hed gone awav some-
 wheres

   kunkel returned to his dressing-room
and mechanically made ready for the eve-
ning performance after all the years of
peace and quiet delilah had samson in the
toils the serpent was in the garden

   its an old truism the older they are the
 harder they fall

   kinkels infatuation was the talk of the
 theater he dined and lunched his fair
 charmer he lavished boxes of candy and
 flowers galore

    shell have him jumpin through the
hoop an playin dead was bill macnutts
gloomy prediction  its about an even
bet he marries her in buffalo next week
kunkel viewed the situation with anguish
but there was nothing he could do kinkel
had been of age for many years and pre-
sumably had cut all his eye-teeth

   many a theatrical team has been wrecked
 by feminine wiles a dissolution of kinkel
 and kunkel would be a catastrophe akin
 to a break between damon and pythias
 or the smith brothers
the end justifies the means



  the following week the partners miss

  tremaine and the macnutt act were
to appear at the majestic in buffalo from
there miss tremaine was to go to new
york for ten weeks of keith time while
the other two turns journeyed to the state-
lake in chicago

  in the division of labor connected with
their business it was kunkels duty to pur-
chase transportation and attend to the bag-
gage while kinkel looked after the orches-
tra rehearsals

  so on sunday morning at toronto kun-
kel bought the tickets for buffalo and
checked the trunks he was seated in the
waiting room talking to bill macnutt
when his partner entered with miss tre-
maine

   lookit whispered bill hoarsely

 hes carryin her grip

   in the theatrical world carrying a ladys
hand-baggage is as much a badge of servi-
tude as fidos collar

   ow are you this morning said miss
tremaine sweetly

   gmomin responded kunkel stiffly

 spose vour hotel trunk goes to maloneys
kinkel 

  maloneys was a buffalo boarding house
favored by vaudeviilians of economical
tastes

  naw it dont said kinkel  send it
to the statler

  on the trip to buffalo kinkel sat in the
ladies car with miss tremaine while kun-
kel rode in the smoker with bill macnutt

  to think of him floppin for a dame
after all these years said kunkel

   i never knew a man yet that didnt
get landed sooner or later observed bill
sagely  you aint never safe till your
hands is folded an the lids nailed on

    well id give a hundred dollars if some-
body would push that she body-snatcher off
the bridge when were crossin the niagara
river declared the worried comedian

  kunkel was nearly made-up for the mon-
day matinee when kinkel came in for
many years kinkel had worn a five-carat
diamond tie-pin it was a beautiful stone
and worth twenty-five hundred dollars it
was kinkels most cherished possession
to-day it was not in his tie

  hey kinkel yelled kunkel  yer

ice is gone you aint lost it

   naw i aint lost it growled kinkel

 im havin it set in a ring

  kunkel said no more but he sought mac-
nutt at the earliest opportunity

   say bill he said  kinkels havin
his lamp put in a ring i wonder what for
 i aint wonderin a-tall i know re-
plied bill  i was with him this momin
when he took it to the jewelry- store hes
gonna have it set in platinum an give it to
tremaine it wont be ready till after the
matinee saturday looks to me like its
gonna be an engagement ring

   the dem fool is crazy groaned kun-
kel  whats he want to go an get mixed
up with a old hen thats had half a dozen
husbands already i wisht i knew some
way to wake him up before its too late

   it sure is gonna make a bum outa
your act said bill  if i knowed any
way to help you out id do it that
womans a regular octypuss

  that night macnutt hailed kunkel as
he was coming off the stage and mysteri-
ously drew him into a comer

   i gotta grand idea doped out he said

 itll either be a hummer or a bust but i
think itll go through if it does kinkel

	save the diamond an lose the jane are
you game to chance a hundred on it

   whats this glorious idea inquired
kunkel

   i can t tell you said bill  you just
gotta take a chance i aint gonna make
a cent on it

   all right said kunkel recklessly  go
ahead an shoot

  the subjugation of kinkel was complete
as a lover he made romeo look like a piker
his expenditures for food candy and
flowers fairly appalled his partner

   hes gone clean off his nut he wailed
to bill  in thirty years i never seen him
let go a dollar before unless he had to

 aw theyre all that way when they
get mushy said bill soothingly  when
hes over this hell be tighter than ever
 yeh said kunkel  but is he ever
go in to get over it

   you wait an see replied bill with an
inscrutable air


argosy-allstory weekly

  wthen he came into the dressing room on
saturday night kinkel produced a velvet
box which he opened with a flourish

   aint it a nifty he inquired

  it was indeed a beautiful ring the
stone in its platinum setting resembled a
ball of fire

   are you really goin to give that to
tremaine said kunkel

   why shouldnt i its mine aint it
demanded the romeo  an furthermore
im goin to ask her to marry me shes
the sweetest little girl i ever met

   girl  repeated kunkei scornfully
 shes had six husbands

   shes had four said the infatuated
one  she couldnt help it if they all
died

  the minute the curtain was down on the
performance that night there was a rush
and bustle on the stage the acts on the
bill were scattering to all points of the
compass some to pittsburgh some to
canada some to boston kinkel and kun-
kel and the macnutts were to leave at
eleven-forty for chicago miss tremaine
was to take the midnight train for new
york so kinkel would have to work fast
with his presentation and love-making

  pieces of scenery hurtled across the stage
propelled by frenzied stage-hands actors
ran up and down grip in hand trunks
bounded out of dressing-rooms and crashed
on the floor dogs barked and out in the
alley the transfer men were loading bag-
gage and hurling abusive language at each
other it was the invariable saturday
night pandemonium

  kinkel was waiting for miss tremaine
and kunkel hovered around vainly hoping
that some miracle might save his deluded
partner bill macnutts scheme whatever
it was had evidently evaporated and that
gentleman was not in evidence

  miss tremaine as befits a lady and a
headliner was the last to leave her dress-
ing room she came tripping across the
stage with a smile dimpling her cheeks
suddenly the anile vanished her eyes
opened wide a look of horror spread over
her countenance

  as kinkel advanced to meet her he was
rudely thrust aside by a tall stranger the

unknown wore a black mustache and goatee
there was a demoniac air about him all

he needed was the red suit to be mephis-

topkeles

 well dotty he said  aint you got
a kind word for your lovin husband

 ow-o-o-o wailed miss tremaine

  you cawnt be enery t was blowed
hup in frawnce you dont talk like im
ow-o-o-o 

  then miss tremaine gave vent to a
piercing shriek and promptly fainted in the
arms of a convenient stage hand

 lets beat it said kunkel to kinkd

  kinkel allowed himself to be led away
he seemed to be walking in a trance all
the way to the depot he never uttered a
word he kept close to kunkel while the
baggage was being checked he sat in the
waiting room watching each arrival appre-
hensively and he continually wiped his
perspiring forehead and moistened his lips
it was not until they were seated in the
sleeper and the train was pulling out of
buffalo that he spoke

   im cured he said  no more skirts
for me

   its a lucky thing for you that her
husband turned up when he did said
kunkel severely  half an hour more
an youd have lost your rock funny
thing him showin up that way he was sup-
posed to be killed in the war

   well im darned glad he wasnt said
kinkel decidedly

  the train was late into chicago and they
had to rush to make their opening perform-
ance on time it was not until after the
matinee that kunkel encountered bill mac-
nutt

   i sure did put it over didnt i said
mr macnutt

   you put what over inquired kunkel
 i didnt see you do anything

   why you dumb-bell said bill  didnt
the guy show up just right to spill the
beans who do you think brought him
there

  do you mean her husband said
kunkel

 on the level youve played dutch so
long that you really are thick said bill

 why you poor fish that wasnt her hus-

band that was a guy named wally

hughes hes a legit been out of work all
season i got him on the long-distance
wednesday night an told him id give
him fifty dollars to come up to buffalo
the way hes fixed hed kill his grand-
mother for fifty bucks i had to wire him
a ticket an pay his board he sure was a
dead ringer for bozo when he was made-up
when tremaine got wise ill bet she let
out a terrible holler i just spent about a
hundred what with givin him fifty an the
fare both ways from new york

    u

  slowly kunkel counted a hundred dollars

into bills outstretched camous mitt he
sighed as each bill left his hand

  mr macnutt pocketed the money

   i dunno he said dubiously  i dont
feel just right about it resurrectin a
husband thats been planted for four years
is kind of a raw trick to pull on a woman
 oh it is is it rejoined kunkel  now
let me ask you is it half as raw as it is
for her to try an glom a twenty-five hun-
dred dollar stone off a poor old sap like
kinkel

baker and bread-line

       h e was a bakers apprentice
       and bent his
       back to the mixing and kneading

        night after night he spent his
        youth for the ovens feeding

        night after night night after night
        he sweated his soul and seared his sight
        sweltering but succeeding

       journeyman then then master

          and faster
       he served the molochian altar
       acolyte exorcist pastor

        telling the loaves of his psalter
        pan-load and man-load and trav-load
        oven-load counter-load dray-load
        never a day did he falter

       then when the long years had tired him

          they fired him

        every job has its dead line

        past it nobody desired him

        so in the charity-fed line

       he of the mixing and making

        he of the infinite baking

        stands in the bread line

received via w  mcgeehan

the price of a pass

       rha nks to the fact that izzy kaplan not only looks a gijt horse in the mouth
       but hires a veterinary surgeon to help him and thanks also to the assiduity o
       his listening partner ik o mcgeehan who separated him from the result of
       his researches this magazine is enabled to present to its readers a dramatic warn-
       ing entitled the price of a pass

           there never was a time when izzy would have bought the woolworth build-
       ing for fifty-five dollars from an open-faced stranger in a check suit without asking
       for a receipt nevertheless his friend succeeded in extracting from izzv in a con-
       fidential moment the admission that he the all-seeing optic of sport purveyor of
       the lowest down in dope and unblushing associate of newspaper men had once
       bitten at that infamous confidence game the free pass older than the gold brick
       and more effective than the slungshot

            izzy has reserved the motion picture rights to this gripping bit of literature
       for he feels that through them he still has a chance to get his eighty-seven dollars
       and fifty cents back-the editor

e and moe koenigsberg aint good friends no more
on account i chust gave him a smesh in the eye
what did he done to me well i will tell you
that feller ectually went and offered me a free
gratis pass to the polish grounds to see the giants
playing a baseballing with the pittsburgh pieiaces

       you are esking me why i should hit a feller
a smesh in the eye on account he only offered me
a free gratis pass to the polish grounds that
shows you aint had no experience with the free
pass business when you been in the woild as
long as i been and know about that pass thing you would hit your own brother on the
chin if he tried to give you a free pass

      listen good and i will told you how i found out about the free pass business
   i got it a friend which he is a sporting editor and he writes for the papers when he
   gets it a good inspirationing from the sympathetic gin he told me confidential that
   he never did like the stuff but on account of the great nerfous strain which he is


izzy kaplan s kolumn



under it all the time he takes a little bit of it so it should deaf out his brain and
even time i meet him he is having his brains cleared out

     well one day i went to him and i said to him  helloi jim do me for a favor
get me a free pass to the polish grounds on account i would like to told my friends
in harlem that i was sitting up in the pest box with all the big fellers maybe they
would think i am so important that i could run for a district leader

    he said  izzy passes is hard to get on account the giant menegement dont
think no more of a pass than they do of their right eye they want all of the cus-
tomers to be strictly cesh but for you izzy i would done it you are more like a
brother than chust a plain sport

    so i told him i was much obliged about it and he whispered me  first izzy
i know it a place where they got the real stuff no hooch izzy and no good-natured
alcohol the feller had this stuff in
his cellar before the germans inwaded
the bullgines and the war was

so what could i done i took
him to the choint and the drinks was
eighty-five cents and the glesses
wasnt so large neither we had
about six or seven drinks on account
of the sociability and me and the
feller was good friends and he said
my woice was a fine tenner and me
and him would be a fine quartet for
sweet addlestein which is a nice
song when you are singing it right

finally i got the sporting
editor to come out

when the feller wouldnt
sell us no more of the stuff
which he had it before the
war was we went out on
the street and my friend
the sporting editor said
 izzy it is bad for the
digestion that a feller
should see it a baseballing
game without he had a good lunch the excitement loosens the epiglotus and unless
the system is tightened up by food a feller is likely to catch anything

    that sounded like a good adwice so i took him to solomons cafe and we had a
lot of lunch so we wouldnt get weak or nothing while we was watching the baseball-
ing in solomons there was a lot of chenuine old-fashioned eight per cent beer
which they fix it up by mixing a little ether in the nearly beer we had eight or ten
seidels of this and it was wery nice to wash down the food

    me and mr solomon which he runs the restaurant is wery good friends and
he wouldnt overcharge me nothing so the whole check was only twenty-four dollars
and a haluf which inclusioned the beer and the seidel which the sporting editor threw
into the looking glass when he was showing me how mr alexander of chicago
throws it the curve out

finally i got the sporting editor to come out of the place on account it was get-


argosy-allstory weekly

ting almost time for the baseball to commence starting he wanted me to prectice

 sweet addlestein  out on the corner on account he said it sounded much better in
the open air where you could get the effect of it much nicer but there was a
politzman stending by and i dont like to get into no argerments with politzmen on
account wunst i lost at one the same time three teeth

     i wanted him to get in the subways but he stopped me  no izzv he said

 t never ride to the ball park in the subways on account it would disturb my train
of thought wte should take it a texiceb on you on account  am getting you into
the polish grounds for nothing

     so we got into the ceb at the bridge and the polish grounds is out by one hun-
dred fifty-five street and the clock was going around pretty fast so that  am
beginning to wonder about the whole business when we get to the pest gate where
they let it in the free customers the bill is fourteen dollars and a haluf

     pretty soon we are in the pest box down by the wire where the baseballers is
starting to prectice a fresh feller comes up to me and he esks me what paper  am
with i told him i was with them all and not against any of them on account i want
to be nice and friendly then he says  you got to beat it

     i looked at the sporting editor feller but he was asleep and maybe letting his
brains have a rest so he would have it a good inspirationing to write it a piece for the
paper i shook him but he wouldnt wake up and pretty soon comes it a politzman
who says  outside you i wouldnt give him no argerment so i went outside
and i looked in my pocket so i could buy it a ticket to see the baseballing but i never
had a dime left before i started i had eighty-seven dollars and a haluf

     then i went up to the feller which is selling tickets to the cesh customers and i
esked him how much was ft a ticket

      with the war texes and everything inclusioned it is one dollar and ten cents
he told me

     then i started to edd up all the expenses and i came to the conclusion that a
free pass was not a good business i spend it eighty-seven dollars and a haluf for a
free pass and i dont even see the baseballing when i could have got in for a dollar
ten cesh money aint that a good proof that cesh is the best way to do business
even you dont get no discount

     so that is why i hit moe koenigsberg a smesh in the eye a feller that thinks
i would take it a free pass eny more is giving me a insult because only a feller who
is pretty dumb would take it a free pass to anything passes is nix with me from
that time on no matter who is giving them out when you get something for nothing
you would find out that it is nothing at all that the feller who gave it to you for nothing
would got something when you wasnt thinking

the miracle of the wilderness

n the heart of a forest-

high up in the purple-topped adirondacks where the snows fall
early and stay late a hunter sat down in the great silence to rest

leaning on his gun he fell asleep and dreamed   

the forest melted away in place of the fragrant pines that swept
the sky and the giant oaks that closed in about him quaint cottages
dotted the mountain-side in place of the native fox and deer he
hunted the wilderness was suddenly peopled with many sick-
seeking the blessing of health   

the huntsman was edward livingston trudeau-the beloved
physician the doom of consumption upon him he was carried
to the adirondacks to make his last days as comfortable as possible

this was nearly half a century ago in those days consump-
tion-now known as tuberculosis-was looked upon as a visi-
tation of providence-was considered unpreventable-incurable

then came the miracle-

of fresh air of sunshine and rest soon dr trudeau was hunting
and fishing again the summer past he returned to the city a
relapse brought him back to try-as a last hope-a winter in
the frozen wilderness suicidal mania friends said cold air was
regarded as fatal to consumptives

dr trudeau thrived on it and lived for forty years in the mountains that taught
him how to use for himself and others the greatest weapons against tuberculosis
-fresh air-rest-sunshine

closely following kochs great discovery that a germ - the tubercle bacillus-
causes tuberculosis dr trudeau learned to recognize the little rods of red
soon physicians everywhere learned to detect the disease in its early stages and
thousands of lives were saved for it is in its early stages that tuberculosis can
be cured

 to bring the sick-

 the many tuberculous sick-from the cities to the healing wilderness was the
 dream of the beloved physician he realized his dream when he built the adiron-
 dack cottage sanitarium the first sanitarium for the open-air treatment of tu-
 berculosis in america-now a wonderful city of houses built inside-out

 one million sufferers from tuberculosis-

 is the estimated number in the united states right now the disease attacks
 lungs skin brain and bone beggar and millionaire are exposed it attacks all
 ages-from babyhood to old age acute danger periods are infancy and early
 adult life the greatest death toll is exacted between  and -the most pro-
 ductive years of life-just when the family is most dependent on breadwinner
 or homemaker

 no medicine will cure tuberculosis-

 but it can be cured by fresh air-day and night winter and summer rain or
 shine by rest good nourishment freedom from worry and supervision by
 trained physicians most of all by sunshine in the home and sunshine in the heart
 better than cure is prevention through regular examination by
 physicians sanitary living and working conditions and always
 fresh air and sunshine

 a great crusade is being waged since  the tuberculosis
 death rate for the united states has been cut in half but the
 fight is not the fight of any one country it is the fight of all
 humanity and when all humanity fights then shall the great
 white plague that has whitened the world with tombstones for
 more than two thousand years be driven from the earth

 before health work was started there
 was a death from tuberculosis every
 eight minutes of every working day of
 eight hours among metropolitan policy
 holders the disease still causes one-
 twelfth of all the deaths in this country
 if this proportion is allowed to con-
 tinue it means that among the people
 now living in the united states over
  are doomed to die from this
 preventable disease working with
 national state and local organizations
 -the metropolitan life insurance
 company has reduced the tuberculosis
 death rate for its policy holders 
 in ten years as one-seventh of the
 population of the united states and
 canada is insured in the metropolitan
 the lowering of the death rate vitally

 affects the entire country eight years
 ago the company built a sanitarium
 at mount mcgregor to care for sick
 members of its staff in the first seven
 years there were  cases of tuber-
 culosis discharged the reports show
 that soe of these employees are back
 at work for five years the metropol-
 itan has supported a demonstration of
 health work in framingham mass a
 manufacturing town the tubercu-
 losis death rate in that time has been
 cut in two the metropolitan issues
 a booklet telling how to prevent how
 to cure tuberculosis a free copy of
 a war on consumption will be
 mailed to all who ask for it

are you living on
promises

i cant do anything for you right now bill but
ill certainly keep you in mind well hope for
something a little later

- - diplomatic way of saying nothing doing
and yet-every employer everywhere is ready to
raise the mnn whose work justifies an increase

w hy continually refuse to face the issue

what you want is not a pleasant smile and a
promise -but real advancement-such advance
ment as is reflected in the iollowing statements
by lasalle ttained men

     lasalle training has taken me from the -a -
     month class to a present earning power of
     over n  per annum

    makes a total gain of  per cent since 
    started training 

    passed bar examination with second highest
    honors in a class of seventy-one 

     was mill superintendent with no practical
    experience in a business way when i started
    the course within one year i was promoted
    to general superintendent within a period
    of three years lasalle training has increased
    my income from  a month to  a year 

    i nave had an increase of nearly  m the
    last six months as a result of lasalle training
    under the problem method - but it is the
    foundation which i am building for something
    better that gives me the greatest satisfaction

those statements are not unusual thousands
of letters in the files of lasalle extension uni-
versity tell the same enthusiastic story men in
the humblest positions men of merely average
ability are rapidly stepping into the big-pay posi-
tions-simply because they have had the good
sense to acquire specialized training under the
lasalle problem method

in together with details of out convenient payment

   rijis offer too goob to be true

is it possible hat we are offering a value too great to be credible 
do people shy at the thought of getting too much for their money p

we recently mailed several thousand cir-
culars to bookjoverv we described and
pictured these thirty volumes of the
little leather library honestly sincerely ac-
curately but we received relatively few orders

  then we mailed several more thousand cir-
culars to booklovers this lime enclosing a sample
cover of one of the volumes illustrated below
orders came in by the hundred the reason
we believe is that most people can not believe
we can really offer so treat a value unless they
see a sample

  in this advertisement naturally it is im-
possible for us to show you a sample volume
the best we can do is to describe and picture
the books in the limited space on this page and
to hope you will believe what we say instead
of thinking this offer is  too good to be true

what this offer is

ful limp material tinted in antique copper
and green and so handsomely embossed that
even experts often mistake it for hand-tooled
leather

  and though the entire set contains over
 pages the price is only	plus

postage how is this made posible simply
by printing in editions of almost one million
at a time

  we know from our daily mail that many
thousands of people still cannot believe we can
sell  such volumes for  plus postage

  we do not know how to combat this skepti-
cism all we can say is serd for these  vol-
umes if you are not satisfied return them at
any time within a month and you will not be
out one penny

send no money

   here then is our offer the illustration below
shows thirty of the worlds greatest masterpieces
of literature these include
the finest works of such im-
mortal authors as shake-
searc kipling stevenson

emerson poe coleridge

burns omar khayyam

macaulay lincoln wash-
ington oscar wilde gil-
bert longfellow drum-
mond conan doyle ed-
ward everett hale thor-
eau tennyson browning
and others these are books
which no one cares to con-
fess he has not read

   each of these volumes is
complete the paper is a
high-grade white wove an-
