  talks with top-notch readers

keeping up the pace

t was not my intention to talk with
you much ill this number about
top-notch and its stories but the
receipt this morning of a letter
from a man in pittsburgh has
changed my plan it is at once the shortest
and one of the most significant letters i have
ever received the writer who signs himself
c a beeston says

  ifou set yourself a stiff pace and you are
holding it may you continue to do so but
as the scotchman says i hae me doots

  there is one thing never asked of us and
yet that most of us indulge in even if it
generally comes out wrong and that is the
gentle weakness of making prophecies

  whatever comes up-war weather elec-
tions automobile engine valves any old
thing-its all the same to us we spring
out like jack from his box with our prophecy

  we have hard work resisting the delightful
temptation to show that when it comes to
judgment and foresight we are the whole tour-
ing car with an extra pair of tires on the roof

s

sometimes current events take such a
turn that with all our confidence we
dont venture a prediction one way or the
other nevertheless we cant squelch our
genius for reading the future so we shake
our heads wisely and announce that we have
our doubts thats pretty safe it belongs
to the heads-i-win-tales-you-lose class of
prophecy whichever way the weather comes
-rain or shine-you can say you had your
doubts about it coming any other way

  but our friend in pittsburgh i am quite
sure is not of the hedging order judging
from his use of the old scotch phrase he
doubts that we shall be able to keep top-
notch up to the standard it has set for itself

  this we take as a high compliment and i
havent any idea that he meant it otherwise
an important consideration is that-here we
fall into the prophecy pit-his doubt may be
dispelled for top-notch bigger than ever

with this issue is going to be not only as
good as but better than ever

  it is going to keep up the pace

  pretty hard to do that in any held of en-
deavor every one knows it all of us think
it is specially difficult in our own particular
activity so i find myself thinking that keep-
ing up such a pace as top-notch has hit is
not half so easy as rolling off a log

  but that doesnt matter we are all
going to pitch in and well getaway with
it prophecy again you see oh we
cant help itl

  in this issue of top-notch there are
thirty-two pages of stories more than ever
before and future issues will be of the same
size i will resist the temptation to declare
that this magazine will continue to be not
only bigger in bulk but bigger in entertaining
power bigger in the range of its stories
better than such a declaration is just -to go
ahead and make it so letting you for yourself
see its steady forward march

ss

 lot of letters speak well of the depart-
ments mechanics for top-notch
readers and in your own shop we are
glad to say that these features have proved
to be popular with you in only one of the
letters has there appeared a request that we
print an article on any particular subject
this letter comes from edward j bullock
east division street syracuse new york
he says in part

  about two months ago you published an
article on how to build a canoe now
that was some article what i want is how
to build an ice boat some people say it
is very simple it undoubtedly is if you know
how

  will you please find out how and publish
it in one of the future magazines it will
not only be a favor to me but to a large
number of young men who are waiting for
the same thing but dont like to ask for it
i thank you in advance

  we are glad to receive requests of this
sort and if it be possible we shall try to
respond with the desired article in the case
month ten-cent magazine

of the ice boat that was done in the issue
of january ist

tiscussion is continued by some of
top-xotchs honorary editors on the
subject of the serial novel i think it a good
thing for us to get together on this as well
as any topic whose discussion may result in
making the magazine more entertaining

  thats what you as readers are after
thats what the publishers and the editors
are striving for let editors and honorary
editors pull together

 mr e l kemp of brandon vermont
replies to mr parke m lawrence of con-
neautville pennsylvania whose letter ap-
peared in our december mid-month issue
mr lawrence who was against serials said
that between installments the reader is likely
to forget to lose the run of the story mr
kemp says

  i feel sorry for mr lawrence if his mem-
ory wont serve him for fifteen days on a
stretch it must need cultivating my own
memory is not of the best but i can remem-
ber what i read fifteen days ago i have no
trouble keeping the run of the serials in top-
notch

  now with the serials cut out i feel quite
sure that the magazine would lose most of its
charm to seven-tenths of its readers and it
certainly will for me if it is enlarged to the
extent that the price will have to be raised
also and also the way you run the serials
three issues to a story makes it just right
to suit me i wish to say that i partly agree
with raymond a stevens of amsterdam
new york as to the way to read the serials
-that is save the numbers of the magazine
and read the whole serial at one time i
dont do that way but i read the other
stories before i start a new serial so that
after i have read it the next issue is nearly
due i have been an ardent admirer of top-
notch since its birth

  the above letter was written on november
  mr kemp knows by this time that
with the enlargement of top-xotch has
come no enlargement of its price there
never was any intention on the part of the
publishers to raise the price-to take it out
of the class where it stands alone the only
ten-cent magazine published twice a month

  from newport rhode island comes this
shriek against serials

mr burt l standish

  dear str  we are sending you this letter
to tell you that in this citv of newport
rhode island we are not in favor of serials
we know at least seven xewport young men
who have stopped reading your splendid
magazine and two more are on the verge of

quitting it because of serials it is the best
clean magazine in the good old u s a only
for the serials please stop them

                   yours truly

                          peter brady
                          john greer



it strikes me that the subjoined letter has
 the right ring the writer says that he
likes both serials and complete stories and
demands both

  top-xotch is printed for many many
thousands of readers one should bear 
mind and you know how tastes vary

  but an excellent way-and this corre
spondent seems to have it-is to take your
copy of the magazine every time it comes
to hand and get out of it all the enter-
tainment it offers whether that be in the
form of serials or complete tales

  list to a man who knows his top-notch
and how to enjoy it

mr burt l standish

  dear sir  this talk about the serial story
has grasped me to the point where i must
bellow forth my say as loud as possible

  a magazine cant exist without the serial
yet be popular

  i find out by reading as many stories that
i can lay hands on that some subjects cant
be treated right in a serial and demand a
short story while other subjects just vice
versa needing detail which a short or com-
plete story in one issue cant and never will
bring out and as we like both these kinds
of subjects we will have to take complete and
serial stories

  in conclusion i wish you all a pleasant time
in reading the stories of this issue and i wish
to subscribe myself a lover of both serial
and complete stories and a demander of
both	nath schneider

i he new serial novel for our next issue

	is one of adventures that have a lot to
do with chaps who go up to the air in
ships it is called on the wings of chance
and the author is john milton edwards new
to top-notch readers except for a stirring
railroad story of his that appeared in the
january st number-wild dynamite

  this airship tale is a good one and i speak
of it specially because not a great many good
airship tales have been written we had
been looking for a story of the kind forsome
time without any great success but when
mr edwards turned in this one we knew it
was the goods i await with much interest

eager for the fray

ayne leland better
known to his comrades of
double b ranch as reck-
less leland spent a part of
his first day in new york at
bronx park viewing the wonders of the
world-famous zoological gardens

  having feasted his eyes on lions ti-
gers elephants gorillas and the vari-
ous other wild beasts in captivity until
his inordinate appetite for such marvels
of nature was satisfied he left the park
and tried to find his way back to the
subway station with the intention of
returning to his hotel in west forty-
second street

  hitting the wrong trail he wandered
far into the wilds of westchester coun-
ca

ty suddenly upon gaining the brow of
a wooded hill he came upon a thrilling
scene

  there stood a girl tied to a stake
her big bown eyes were opened wide
with fear and horror her face was
deathly white her tiny hands were
clasped despairingly at her feet
crackled a bonfire around her danced
a horde of savage indians hideous in
their war paint splitting the air with
fiendish blood-curdling yells as they
whirled around their helpless victim

  waynes lower jaw dropped and his
heart almost stopped beating dont
think for a minute though that his
emotion was due to the fact that he took
what he saw for the real thing even
though he was from a ranch and this
was his first visit to new york the
westerner had eyes and ears and there-


top-notch magazine

fore did not fail to note the whirring
moving-picture camera that was sta-
tioned a short distance to the right of
the despairing woman

  and although he had never seen such
an apparatus before he did not jump
to the conclusion that it was a gatling
gun or a sewing machine or a musical
instrument according to the average
easterners conception of a cowboy
that is what he ought to have done but
even though he hailed from the very
wildest and wooliest section of the wild
and woolly west wayne had intelli-
gence and was in the habit of reading
the newspapers and magazines when he
could get hold of them he took in the
situation at a single glance and realized
that he was for the first time in his life
witnessing a motion picture in the proc-
ess of making

  why then did his lower jaw drop
and his heart nearly stop beating at
what he saw it was because he rec-
ognized the face of the girl tied to the
stake-recognized her as a young
woman whom he knew well and was
head over heels in love with-although
he had never before seen her

  that is to say he had never before
seen her in the flesh but he had seen
her a hundred times in a hundred dif-
ferent roles and each time and each
role had made him more and more her
slave

  cowboys like every one else have
their weaknesses with some it is
liquor with others it is cards with oth-
ers still it is gun play and again it is
all three but reckless lelands rul-
ing passion was moving pictures

  when the photo play first appeared
in the west he became a devotee of
canned drama pretty soon he had the
habit so bad that he would ride a hun-
dred miles to see a new set of films he
became a moving-picture fan of the
most rabid variety

  at first he had loved the pictures for
themselves alone irrespective of what
they were or who posed for them but
it was not long before he began to take
particular notice of a little dark-eyed
slender girl who appeared in many dif-
ferent scenes and eventually his inter-

est incanned drama and canned com-
edy revolved around her

  sometimes she would appear before
his eager admiring eyes as a sheriffs
daughter attired in simple garb rid-
ing like the wind across the prairie to
save her dear father from the bold bad
bandits who were about to take the
lifes blood of that brave but helpless
official

  sometimes he would see her dressed
in silks and satins a grand society lady
sitting in a magnificently furnished
drawing-room and spurning the love of
-the rich old banker who was trying to
win her from the poor but honest young
mechanic to whom she was secretly be-
trothed

  betimes she was the daughter of a
kentucky moonshiner and desperately
jn love with the fearless young revenue
officer who had sworn to find the illicit
still and capture the desperate band
who were cheating uncle sam and yet
again wayne had beheld her in a suit
of oilskins the devoted wife of a deep-
sea fisherman going out into the surf
to climb aboard the lifeboat which was
starting out to rescue dear hubby from
a watery grave

   but whatever the role she played and
whatever the garb she wore those big
dark eyes of hers never changed and
always had the same effect upon reck-
less leland thrilling him through and
through causing him to feel an insane
desire to rush up to the screen and try
to encircle that unsubstantial slender
figure in his strong arms

  and that was the girl how tied to a
stake in the wilds of the bronx sur-
rounded by yelling redskins-the cen-
tral figure of the moving spectacle
which was being made into a moving
picture

  no wonder that waynes emotion got
the best of him as he gazed upon the
girl of his dreams who had thus unex-
pectedly come into reality for a few
minutes he stood there staring at her
like a man in a trance wondering how
on earth he was going to break down
the barriers of formality and get ac-
quainted with her now that he had
found her
his canned drama debut



  and then suddenly an inspiration
came to him he had once read a fool
story about a cowboy in new york who
had gone to a theater and become so ex-
cited at what he witnessed on the stage
that he had leaped across the footlights
to rescue the heroine from the clutches
of the cruel villain

  he had read many other stories too
in which cow-punchers figured as the
most unsophisticated and simple-minded
of men

  accordin to the popular idea here
said reckless to himself we aint sup-
posed to have any sense so i reckon
ill live up to our reputation i ought
to be able to get away with it

  with a yell which would have been
regarded as a very ordinary perform-
ance at red b ranch but which was
unlike anything which had ever been
heard before in the region of the bronx
he dashed over the long grass toward
that animated group

  hey get out of the way there 
shouted the man at the moving-picture
camera but reckless pretended not to
hear he hurled himself into the midst
of the astonished redskins with a vio-
lence which sent three of them sprawl-
ing on their backs and caused the rest
of the horde to flee in panic

  dont be afraid miss he said ad-
dressing the lady tied to the stake i
wont let em hurt you tryin to burn
you alive was they  ill show em
he trampled out the bonfire at the
girls feet and then taking out a big
clasp knife started to sever her bonds

  but at this point the man at the mov-
ing-picture camera and several other
men in cowboy garb who had been
concealed behind a clump of bushes
came up and surrounded him angrily

  what are you doing you blithering
idiot growled one dont you see
that were only taking pictures 

  pictures exclaimed reckless with
well-feigned astonishment waal ill

be denied  i thought-

  to blazes with what you thought
snarled the camera man shaking his
fist in reckless face i yelled to you
not to butt in why in thunder didnt
you listen it took us an hour to re-

hearse that scene before we got it the
way we wranted it and your infernal in-
terference has spoiled it all

  and you stepped on my pet corn
you big boob groaned the chief of the
redskins limping painfully to and fro

im sorry said reckless meekly
you see im a stranger in these parts
and i didnt know what the game was
his apology was addressed to the
girl who smiled upon him kindly

  and you mean to say that you
thought i was really in danger she
said and you started out single-
handed to fight all these fierce indians
in order to rescue me why i think
that was awfully brave of you she
gave him an admiring glance

  reckless blushed his ruse had been
a complete success in that it had given
him what he wanted-a speaking ac-
quaintance with the girl of his dreams
but he didnt quite like the idea of being
a fake hero it made him feel sort of
mean to get that admiring glance re-
alizing that he was not entitled to it
waal you see miss he began

stammeringly i-

  youre from the west arent you
she interrupted him a flattering interest
in her tone no need to ask though
i can tell from your accent my folks

are all-

  say miss holcomb broke in a
short thickset man in a red sweater im-
patiently excuse me for cuttin you
short but the sunll be goin down in a
little while and weve got to hustle
you can tell this gentleman your fam-
ily history after we get through

  he motioned imperiously to reckless
step back please and give us a chance
to do our work now then you in-
dians take your places again just as
you were before this-this gentleman
butted in pie glared witheringly at
reckless who was meekly stepping back
out of range of the camera

  everybody ready shouted the man
in the red sweater miss holcomb
please chase that smile from your face
and look scared and despairing no
lady that was bein roasted alive by in-
dians would look as if she enjoyed it
you know thats better try to hold


top-notch magazine

that expression throughout the pose
now indians start your dancing hey
you fat indian on the left youre out
of step and spoilin the whole effect
if you cant do better than that we cant
use you thats much better keep
that up everybody its very good in-
deed dont forget to yell indians as
soon as i give the signal

  he turned toward the camera man
who had gone back to his apparatus
hey bill he shouted i guess this
is as good as were goin to get it
when i raise my right hand grind her
out

  reckless watching the queer scene
from a distance wondered what grind
her out meant he soon discovered
that it was the technical term for tak-
ing a moving picture for as soon as the
man in the red sweater raised his right
hand the man at the camera began to
turn the crank of his instrument

  the redskins began to yell fiendishly
and kept up their dancing the girl at
the stake wrung her hands despairingly
and maintained the terrified expression
which had won the approbation of the
man in the red sweater

  suddenly the latter put his two hands
to his mouth and yelled to a group of
men in wild-west attire who mounted
on horses were stationed several hun-
dred yards away now then you
cowboys were ready for you come
on all of you

  the cowboys urged on their steeds
and uttering wild yells and waving
their arms frantically came dashing into
the picture

  gee said reckless leland to him-
self with a contemptuous smile
what a punk outfit there aint one
of them fellers that can ride worth a
hang and it was this discovery which
gave him his big idea

chapter ii

reckless learns a lot

it was not until he got back to his ho-

	tel in west forty-second street that
the big idea came to reckless leland

  he had not had a chance to continue
his conversation with the moving-pic-

ture girl for after the posing was over
she had climbed into a big automobile
together with the rest of the troupe and
had gone off without a single glance
in his direction

  it was patent to the disappointed
young man that she had forgotten all
about his existence but she wasnt go-
ing to be allowed to continue to forget
it if he could help it reckless told him-
self as he sat in the hotel lobby twirl-
ing his mustache thoughtfully

  take note of that mustache it is
destined to figure importantly in this
story all that shall be said about it
now however is that it was dark and
luxuriant and contributed not a little
to its owners good looks reckless was
proud of it and he had cause to be for
it really was a creditable mustache

  he sat now as has been said stroking
this decorative growth pensively as he
reclined in a big armchair in the lobby
of the hotel wondering how on earth
he was going to get better acquainted
with the moving-picture girl during his
few weeks stay in new york

  and then suddenly an inspiration
came to him the solution of his prob-
lem was as simple as a b c all he
had to do was to join the outfit to which
she belonged as a fellow member of
the company he would have plenty of
opportunities to cultivate the acquaint-
ance of miss holcomb perhaps even
he would have opportunities to take her
in his arms-business opportunities of
course

  he had observed with a jealous eye
that in every moving picture she ap-
peared in it was some fellows happy
lot to hug her and press kisses upon her
pretty mouth sometimes it was the
sheriff who did the hugging sometimes
the honest young mechanic sometimes
the deep-sea fisherman but whoever it
was she was always hugged by some-
body in each picture

  why shouldnt i be that somebody
sometimes reckless asked himself
thrilling at the thought id give a
whole years pay for one chance like
that and even if i aint lucky enough
to get picked for the huggin scenes he
mused ill at least have a chance to be
his canned drama debut



near her and to talk to her yes i
reckon it would be a mighty good idea
to sign up with that outfit

  he did not proceed to carry out his
plan that night because he figured that
the moving-picture people could not be
found after dark but the next morn-
ing he got in a subway express train
and journeyed out to the bronx with
the intention of making the man in the
red sweater--who seemed to be the boss
-an offer of his services

  without much difficulty he found the
place that had been the scene of the in-
dian outrage the previous day he
knew that he had found the exact spot
because the remains of the bonfire with
which they were going to roast their
captive alive was still there but there
was no sign now o the moving-picture
troupe reckless eager gaze swept
every inch of the prairie for them in
vain

  much disappointed he walked back
to the roadway and approached a man
who sat in the door of a shack smok-
ing a corncob pipe

  seen anythin of the movin-picter
outfit that was playin here yesterday
stranger  he inquired

  not this morning replied the man
they aint showed up yet and the
chances are they wont be here all day
they only come out here a couple of
times a week-when there doin wild-
west stuff

  and where are they now de-
manded reckless eagerly

  the man shrugged his shoulders
thats more than i can tell j-ou my
friend they go all over its a busi-
ness that keeps em on the jump all the
time but if youve got business with
the company why dont you go to the
main office in new york

  whats the name of the company
and whar do they keep stranger in-
quired reckless

  his informant told him that the offi-
cial name of the cpncern was the pen-
dexter moving picture company and
that its headquarters were in east fif-
tieth street

  reckless hurried back to the subway
and three-quarters of an hour later was

standing in the outer office of the pen-
dexter moving picture company ex-
plaining his business to a friendly dis-
posed clerk

  i dont think theyll take you on
the latter told him weve got all the
talent we can use and a big waiting
list besides everybody seems to be try-
ing to get into the moving-picture game
nowadays but you can wait and see
mr eddy if you want to

  mr eddy proved to be a keen-eyed
sharp-featured man who looked reck-
less over from head to foot when the
latter informed him that he had come to
sign up with the outfit

  what experience have you had
young man  ever done moving-picture
work 

  no sir but i can ride a heap better

than-

  been on the stage 

  no sir i havent but as i was say-
in i can ride all around any of them
imitation cow-punchers of yourn i saw
at work yesterday when it comes to
handlin a cayuse there aint a man in
the whole double b outfit that can beat
me-and i reckon thats equivalent to
sayin that im the best in the world
having delivered himself of this mod-
est speech reckless leland looked at
the moving-picture man confidently

  when shall i start to work boss 
he inquired

  mr eddy shrugged his shoulders
if riding is your only accomplishment
my friend im afraid we cant use you
you see in this business wre want ac-
tors not roughriders if you havent
had any theatrical experience we
couldnt think of taking you on
reckless looked astonished

  actors he exclaimed whats
the use of an actor in a wild-west scene
if he cant ride a horse why that
punk outfit of yourn i saw up in the
bronx yesterday was enough to make
even a tenderfoot laugh the way they

jogged along on-

  ever see any of our wild-west pic-
tures on the screen broke in mr ed-
dy with a smile

  yes sir but all the pictures ive
seen had real cowboys in em said


top-notch magazine

reckless any one could tell the dif-
ference by the way they rode and
thats why i-

  they were all posed for by that
same punk outfit you saw at work yes-
terday the moving-picture man broke
in with a laugh you see mr le-
land in this game there are lots of
tricks a man doesnt have to be a
roughrider in order to be able to ride
fast in a moving picture the speed ef-
fect is obtained by cutting out sections
of the film after the picture has been
taken

  cutting out sections of the film re-
peated reckless blankly

  exactly you see the speed de-
pends upon how many picture units
there are in a single motion mr
eddy took from his desk a long strip of
film containing several hundred little
square pictures one under the other

  now heres a film of a fat man run-
ning he went on being fat he
moved very slowly of course and it
took several hundred different picture
units to register his movements if this
film were run through the moving-pic-
ture machine just as it is our fat man
would be shown on the screen making
very slow progress but by cutting out
a unit here and there in the film we
hurry him along and the finished result
has the effect of making him run at
breakneck speed when th picture is ex-
hibited

  he smiled at his visitors astonish-
ment and that is why we can use
actors instead of genuine cow-punchers
in our wild-west scenes he said our
horsemen can move as leisurely as they
please when theyre posing but they
cover the ground just as fast as you
could mr leland when theyre flashed
on the screen

  reckless gulped down his disappoint-
ment then a happy thought came to
him waal talkin about tricks boss
he said how about trick ridin i
reckon you ought to be able to use me
there i can do more  stunts on the
back of a cayuse than a tenderfoot can
do standin on the ground i can han-
dle a lariat some too there aint a
man at red b as can beat me at doin

things with a rope reckon you cant
produce them effects by cuttin out sec-
tions of the film he looked at the
moving-picture man confidently

  mr eddy smiled again ever hap-
pen to see that bucking-broncho picture
of ours mr leland he inquired
quietly in the scene i refer to a cow-
boy is tossed twenty feet up in the air
turns a double somersault and lands on
the bronchos back in a sitting posi-
tion

  reckless chuckled yes sir i re-
member that picter i saw it just be-
fore i started east say that feller
sure is some rider i take off my hat
to him where did you get him

  hes a comedy actor by the name of
kelly replied mr eddy with a laugh
never been on a ranch in his life and
dont know much about riding the
way we got that effect was by another
simple trick first we posed kelly on
the broncho and stopped the camera
just as he was thrown then we took
another picture of him hanging up in
the air from the end of a thin wire he
did those back flips while dangling from
the wire and then we lowered him to
the back of the broncho afterward
the wire was painted out of the nega-
tive and when the finished product was
flashed on the screen it looked realistic
enough to fool even such an expert as
yourself

  and as for lariat throwing he went
on weve turned out some corking
good pictures on that subject you may
be an expert with the rope mr le-
land but even you couldnt do some of
the stunts which our fake cowboys pull
off you see its impossible for them
to miss no matter how difficult the
throw we simply shut off the camera
after theyve hurled the lariat and be-
fore the picture is started again we place
the noose around the object theyre aim-
ing at when the film is shown on the
screen the motion is continuous and it
looks as if the cowboy had made a suc-
cessful throw

  reckless looked dejected then i
reckon you couldnt use me nohow

  no im afraid not ill take your
name and address but i cant give you
his canned drama debut



any hope wild-west pictures are get-
ting to be awful chestnuts anyway
they went fine at first but the market
has been flooded with them and the
public is about sick of them they still
go well over in europe but american
audiences want something new so
were seriously thinking of cutting
down our cowboy and indian output

  reckless left the managers office in
a disconsolate frame of mind his big
idea had failed after all and he had im-
agined that the moving-picture concern
would jump at his offer to join the out-
fit

  as he was going out he encountered
miss holcomb who was just coming in
the moving-picture girl recognized him
immediately and gave him a pleasant
nod he was about to speak to her
but somehow although he was consid-
ered at double b a pretty fluent talker
he now found himself strangely at a
loss for words and before he could
find his tongue she had passed through
a doorway marked no admittance
and his opportunity was gone

  as the door swung closed behind her
reckless recovered his presence of
mind

  wriggling rattlesnakes he mut-
tered with self-contempt what an all-
fired fool i am i might have asked
her to finish what she started to tell me
yesterday about her folks out west
that would have been a good way to
make conversation

  thinking it might not be too late
even then to avail himself of this in-
spiration he strode toward the door
marked no admittance and pushed
it open

  he found himself in a long passage-
way off which several rooms opened
there was no sign of the girl evi-
dently she had entered one of the rooms
reckless was staring at a half dozen
closed doors wondering which one she
had gone through when a small boy
came along the passageway

 hey what do you want he
asked no strangers can come in here
its against the rules didnt you see
that sign

  i was lookin for a lady that just

came in here said reckless her
name is miss holcomb would you
mind tellin her son that id like to
speak with her a few minutes

  the boy looked him over critically
guess youre stuck on her aint you
it aint a bad guess young feller
admitted reckless

  fell in love with her from seein
her in the picters and come to ask her
to marry you eh said the youngster
with a knowing grin

  son youre a wonder said reck-
less admiringly how do you do it
gee its dead easy i can spot
you movin-picture johnnies every time
guess you dont know how many ginks
comes here every day to try to marry
miss ruby holcomb

  you dont say exclaimed reckless
despondently

  sure you didnt suppose you was
the only one did yer why theres a
hundred times as many movin-picture
johnnies as there is stage-door john-
nies guys all over the world fall in
love with ruby from seein her on the
screens and travel to new york to ask
her to marry em them that cant
come write you ought to see the pile
of letters she gets every day from love-
sick gooks that wants to get hitched up
with her some of thems bully good
offers too believe me the other day
she got one from a millionaire out in
minnesota he wrote her that hed set-
tle two million dollars on her on the day
she became his bride thems his own
words

 and what did she say asked
reckless anxiously

  she turned him down replied the
precocious youngster he mentioned
in his letter that he had a wooden leg
and a glass eye she said she might
have stood for the wooden leg but the
bum lamp was a little too much
reckless heaved a sigh of relief
both my eyes are my own he said
ask her if shell let me say a few words
to her son 

  the boy shook his head

  nothin doin miss holcombs very
busy just now besides shes given or-

ders that she aint to be bothered by
any more guys with the marriage bug

chapter iii

in trouble

pinding that the office boy was not

	to be persuaded even though he
offered him a ten-dollar bill for the
privilege of a few minutes talk with
the moving-picture girl leland walked
out of the office of the pendexter mov-
ing picture company and took up a
position on the sidewalk near the en-
trance to the building

  dogged persistence being one of his
traits he had made up his mind to wait
there until miss holcomb came out
even if his vigil had to be maintained
all day

  unfortunately however he was ig-
norant that there were two entrances to
the building-the one at which he was
steadfastly watching and a rear door
which the employees of the company
frequently used

  thus it happened that the moving-
picture girl made her exit without his
seeing her which sad fact he did not
discover until after dark when a night
wratchman informed him that the last of
the pendexter people had long since left
the building

  reckless was considerably discour-
aged he had stood watching that
doorway for eight hours and not a
morsel of food had passed his lips in
that time for he had not ventured to
leave his post even to satisfy the crav-
ings of his stomach

  that his long wait and equally long
fast should have been unrewarded by
even a glimpse of - the girl made him
feel that he wasnt receiving a square
deal from fate

  but after he had dropped into a res-
taurant and put away a good dinner he
looked at things differently

  after all said he to himself
theres lots of other days beside this
un ill try it again to-morrow and
keep right on tryin until i get what i
want mebbe shell be up in the bronx
again to-morrow morning posin for

some more wild-west pictures i might
take a run up there and see

  in the meantime as it was impossible
to pursue his quest of the moving-pic-
ture girl that night not having any
inkling of her home address leland
gratefully accepted the offer of an af-
fable stranger who had generously un-
dertaken to show him the sights of
the town

  this stranger whose acquaintance
reckless made while at dinner in the
restaurant was a well-dressed clean-
shaven man of middle age who was suf-
fering from an unfortunate malady of
the hands which prevented him from
keeping them out of other peoples
pockets

  he did not mention this weakness of
his to reckless however and the latter
found him a very agreeable companion
until after they had visited a score of
interesting places which from the stran-
gers viewpoint represented the best
that was to be seen in new york after
dark they entered a cafe on west
twenty-ninth street and seated them-
selves at a little round table

  it was here that his companions
malady first made itself apparent to the
cowboy two men acquaintances of
the affable stranger were introduced by
the latter to reckless and invited to sit
at the little round table

  reckless ordered beverages and when
he had paid for them and restored his
roll to his trousers pocket he became
dimly conscious of the fact that there
was a hand in that pocket which did not
belong to him

  he made a quick move to grab the
hand but before he could reach it it
had disappeared he felt for his roll
and to his great relief found it was still
there so he said nothing

  the affable stranger who was piloting
him around sat beside him the other
two men sat opposite it seemed there-
fore that the intrusive hand could have
belonged only to the former

  reckless gazed at the mans face long
and searchingly not a trace of discom-
fiture or guiltiness could he detect there
his glance traveled to the countenances
of the other two they were chatting
his canned drama debut	

and drinking with an unconcern which
disarmed suspicion

  perhaps after all i may have been
mistaken reckless told himself nev-
ertheless he took the precaution of se-
cretly shifting his roll to another
pocket

  a few minutes later he again became
aware of a hand stealthily entering the
pocket in which his bank roll had pre-
viously reposed quick as a flash his
own big hand shot beneath the table and
grabbed a wrist

  caught you this time bud he said
quietly turning with a grin to the af-
fable stranger from the clumsiness
of your work i judge that you must be
considerable of an amachoor

  he laughed as his prisoner without
uttering a word struggled vainly to
wrench his wrist from that viselike grip

  but the next moment the laugh froze
on his lips one of the two men sit-
ting opposite leaned over the table and
said very quietly

  let go of him friend and dont
make a sound ive got you covered
under the table

  something pressing against his abdo-
men convinced reckless that this was
no idle boast

  obeying that command his right hand
relinquished its hold on his prisoners
wrist but simultaneously his left hand
moving with remarkable swiftness went
to his hip pocket and his own revolver
flashed into view

  it was a foolhardy act nine men
out of ten would not have attempted to
draw realizing that the other fellow al-
ready had the drop on them even to
make a move toward ones hip pocket
under such circumstances is generally
equivalent to committing suicide

  but reckless leland was a creature
of impulse and it was by taking several
such fool chances as this that he had
earned his nickname applying logic to
a consideration of some of the mad
things he had done in the past he ought
to have been dead several times over
his comrades of the double b outfit
marveled at the extraordinary luck
which had saved him in each instance

  that luck seemed to be with him now

for as his revolver flashed into view
above the table there came a click from
the other revolver under the table

  that click saved reckless life it
meant that his opponents revolver had
in some way missed fire before the
fellow could pull the trigger again le-
lands weapon barked and the man op-
posite fell sprawling across the table

  it all happened so quickly and so
quietly that the attention of the people
at the other tables-there were a score
of men and a half dozen women in the
place-was not attracted until the shot
from the revolver rang out

  then there was great confusion
men shouted women screamed tables
and chairs and potted palms were over-
turned  and as nearly always happens
in such cases all the lights in the place
were suddenly extinguished by some
panic-stricken employee whose first
thought was to rush to the wall switch
and plunge the scene in darkness

  then came the police and a crowd
from outside who had been attracted by
the sound of the shot and the cries from
within

  the lights were turned on again and
the man whom reckless had shot was
discovered lying across the little round
table unconscious but still breathing

  his two friends had vanished so
likewise had reckless leland they
had taken advantage of the temporary
darkness to make a hasty retreat to the
street

  if this thing had happened in his own
country reckless would have waited
calmly for the arrival of the sheriff
confident that no harm could come to
him for what he had done inasmuch as
he had acted in self-defense

  but he didnt know how such matters
were adjusted in new york he had
an idea that from an eastern viewpoint
his act would be regarded as murder
notwithstanding the extenuating circum-
stances he was a stranger in the city
and he figured that that might count
against him for there is something
about new york which gives a stranger
the impression that it is hostile to him

  therefore he had decided that it
would be a good thing to get away


top-notch magazine

while he had the chance and as soon
as the lights went out in the cafe he
thrust his revolver into his pocket and
moving swiftly toward the door made
his way to the street unnoticed

  too bad i had to shoot that crook
he said to himself as he swung into
broadway and hurried toward his ho-
tel  but hed have dropped me sure if i
hadnt wonder if i killed him if
so i guess id better pack my kit and
get back west before they get on my
track reckon id better do that any-
way even if he aint dead new york
aint no place for me just now

  he felt in his pocket for his money
and discovered that it was still there
he drew a deep breath of relief at that
pleasing discovery it had suddenly oc-
curred to him that perhaps the affable
stranger had taken advantage of the ex-
citement following the shooting and ab-
stracted his roll it would have been
decidedly awkward to find himself pen-
niless just then-sans the price of a
railroad ticket back to double b ranch

  thank goodness ive still got it
he said to himself ill take the first
train out

  but when he reached his hotel the
clerk handed him a special-delivery let-
ter

  it came this afternoon mr leland
he said and as you werent in i signed
for it

  thanks partner said reckless and
he tore open the envelope eagerly for
it bore the imprint of the pendexter
moving picture company

  this is what he read

mr wayne leland hotel worthing

  dear sir  please call and see me to-
morrow morning regarding a position i
have changed my mind since our conversa-
tion this morning and think we can use you

          yours truly

george p eddy manager

chapter iv

        the lure of a job

deckless decided at first to ig-
 nore that letter discretion told
him that in view of what had happened
at the cafe it would be useless to keep
that appointment with mr eddy a

moving-picture job in new york was
out of the question now it would be
dangerous to delay his departure for the
west

  but he thought of the moving-picture
girl atod the opportunity to cultivate her
acquaintance which this letter held out
to him and he threw discretion to the
winds

  early the next morning he started out
to visit the offices of the pendexter
company and on his way there he
bought a morning paper being eager to
ascertain whether the man he had shot
was still alive and whether the identity
of the latters assailant was known or
suspected

  he was relieved to read that his vic-
tim was at the hospital and not yet dead
although the surgeons did not hold out
much hope of his pulling through

  he was still more relieved to learn
that the police had not yet succeeded in
finding out who had done the shooting
regarding this the newspaper said

  testimony of eyewitnesses as to the ap-
pearance of the man who fired the shot is
hopelessly conflicting some say that he
was a short stockily built man of middle
age others are equally positive that he was a
tall slim young man while still others have
given the police such various and contra-
dictory descriptions of him that the authori-
ties are without a clew as to the identity of
the assailant in the excitement and com-
motion following the tragedy he easily made
his escape and it is feared that he will never
be found

  i hope this paper is right said
reckless to himself guess im tol-
erably safe even if i do stay in new
york id give myself up in a minute
if i thought theyd give me a square
deal but from what ive seen of this
town i reckon theres no chance of that
so im goin to think it over a whole lot
before i decide to fess up

  half an hour later he was in the pri-
vate office of mr eddy manager of the
pendexter moving picture company
listening in astonishment to that gentle-
mans offer of five dollars per day to
pose for wild-wrest scenes

  but i thought you told me yesterday
that wild-west stuff was played out
and that you was goin to chuck it
said reckless
his canned drama debut



  the manager smiled circum-
stances alter cases mr leland short-
ly after your visit yesterday the direc-
tors of this company held a meeting and
decided to go in big for the european
trade as i believe i mentioned cow-
boys and indians while somewhat passe
in the home market are still all the rage
on the other side of the ocean so in-
stead of cutting down we are going to
increase our output of such scenes

  i see said reckless but you said
too yesterday that you didnt need gen-
uine cow-punchers for such work-that
it didnt cut no ice how fast a fellow
could ride or how spry he might be
with a rope

  mr eddy smiled again well of
course we havent got any particular
objection to expert horsemen even
though we can increase the speed of or-
dinary ones by cutting out sections of
the films under the conditions which
existed at the time of our interview
yesterday morning we preferred men
with theatrical experience to those with
experience on a ranch-performers who
could pose as cowboys or redskins to-
day and waiters in a swell restaurant or
sailors in a submarine boat to-morrow
but now that we have decided to go in
strong for wild-west stuff i guess we
shall have enough work to maintain a
special company for that branch of our
business and your ability to do stunts
with a horse ought to come in useful
but the main reason i sent for you mr
leland is-because somebody has
spoken up for you

  spoken up for me

  yes miss ruby holcomb our lead-
ing lady came to me yesterday and
asked me to give you a job inasmuch
as we were increasing our wild-west
work i was glad to oblige her

  reckless fell back in his chair in as-
tonishment if the manager had told
him that the queen of holland had
spoken in his favor he couldnt have
been more amazed it seemed incredi-
ble that the moving-picture girl could
have done this for him and yet he
couldnt see what object mr eddy could
have in lying to him it really must be
the truth

  a grin of delight creased his weath-
er-beaten face so she spoke for me
he chuckled waal boss if thats the
case i reckon ill take the job when
do i start work

  you can report to-morrow morn-
ing weve got a big western scene
on then and will probably need you
you understand of course that were
only taking you on as an extra at first
well pay you five dollars per day for
each day we employ you but i cant
guarantee you full time how often
well use you will depend entirely upon
the quality of your work if you make
good youll get plenty to do

  im going to make good all right
declared reckless confidently

  i hope so the manager wrote a
couple of lines on a card which he
handed to the westerner you know
where our grounds are up in the bronx 
well you can report direct up there to-
morrow morning instead of coming
here first ask for mr bates hes
in charge of our outdoor work

  the chap in the red sweater
thats the man hand him this
card and hell put you right to work
if theres any chance at all to use you
in that scene

  as reckless stepped out of the man-
agers room and was walking through
the main office toward the elevator he
encountered miss holcomb

  good morning said the girl giv-
ing him a cordial smile did you get
work 

  yesm thanks to you replied
reckless strangely ill at ease it was

very kind of you to-

  oh dont mention it i inquired of
one of the clerks what you were doing
here yesterday and he told me that you
had come to look for a job so i put in
a good word for you i owed you a
good turn you know for rescuing me
from those savage indians she
laughed merrily and you may be sure
her laughter thrilled reckless

  and are you goin to be in that scene
up in the bronx to-morrow miss he
asked eagerly

  i should say i am its called the
boss of the ranch you know and im


top-notch magazine

to be the boss my husband who
owned the ranch is dead and instead
of selling out im running the place my-
self my cowboys are all in love with

me and-

  wriggling rattlesnakes perhaps
therell be a chance to hug her said
reckless joyously to himself

  i beg your pardon did you speak
she inquired

  no maam at least i was just
thinking out loud i didnt mean to in-
terrupt please go ahead

  its going to be one of the most
thrilling spectacles weve ever turned
out im stolen by indians and tied to
the back of a horse my brave cow-
boys give chase i guess youll be one
of the cowboys and youll have an-
other chance to rescue me only this
time you wont be butting in and spoil-
ing the film

  once more she laughed merrily and
again reckless was thrilled through and
through i wish it was to-morrow al-
ready he said impatiently as she hur-
ried toward the door marked no ad-
mittance

  when he reached the street a news-
boy passed him yelling wuxtry
wuxtry all about the cafe murder 
wuxtry wuxtry

  reckless bought a paper-the first of
the evening editions which are on
sale before noon-and read these star-
tling headlines

police on trail

of cafe assassin

victim of shooting affray dies in
hospital without regain-
ing consciousness

police now have full description of man
  who fired the fatal shot-dragnet out
  for him-arrest expected soon central
  office says	v

  astonished and greatly perturbed
reckless read every word of the column
of smaller type that followed these head-
lines

  he learned therefrom that the unfor-
tunate man whom he had been com-

pelled to shoot in self-defense had
passed away in the hospital at seven
oclock that morning regarding him-
self the paper said

  although at first it seemed impossible to
obtain a comprehensive description of the
man who did the shooting on account of the
conflicting testimony of the many excited
eyewitnesses the police have now succeedcd
in getting a very definite idea of what the
fellow looked like

  according to james oneill a waiter em-
ployed in the cafe in which the shooting took
place the assassin was a good-looking young
man about twenty-eight years old broad-
shouldered six feet tall and powerfully
built

  he had blue eyes long dark hair a heavy
dark mustache spoke with a drawl and had
every appearance of being a westerner
several other persons the most level-headed
of those who witnessed the tragedy corrob-
orate this description and the police feel
sure that it is correct

  and barrin wrhat it says about me
bein good-lookin i guess theyve got
me down pretty pat said reckless to
himself uneasily i hope theyre just
as right in telling how the thing hap-
pened

  but in this respect the testimony of
these witnesses was not at all in ac-
cord with the facts to his horror and
indignation reckless read on

  the authorities have been unable to learn
as yet what the quarrel was about but all
the eyewitnesses agree that the assassins
act was cold-blooded deliberate and quite
unjusti liable

  he had little or no provocation apparently
for shooting down his victim for the latter
was unarmed and the men were drinking and
conversing amicably together right up to the
moment of the tragedy their voices were
not even raised when the fatal shot rang out
and the shooting came so suddenly and un-
expectedly that it was several minutes be-
fore the eyewitnesses could believe that a
murder had actually been committed

 now what do you think about
that growled reckless little or no
provocation for shootin down my vic-
tim of all the lies ive ever heard or
read thats about the limit and they
say that the feller was unarmed as
though id have shot him if he had been
thats new york for you thats the
kind of a square deal a feller can look
for in this part of the country twen-
ty people must have seen the gun in
his canned drama debut



that fellers hand and seen that i had
to drop him or be dropped myself and
not one of em comes forward to tell
the truth this here town makes me
weary give me the good old west
every time

  it is only just to the witnesses of the
tragedy to state that all of them who
had been questioned by the police be-
lieved that they were telling the truth
in characterizing reckless lelands act
as unprovoked and unjustified

  none of them had seen the weapon
which the crook had held pressed
against the westerners side under the
table none of them had heard a word
of the talk that preceded the shooting
or knew of the attempt that had been
made to rob reckless

  when leland fired his victims
weapon had fallen to the floor and
when the police had picked it up after-
ward they had concluded that it was the
weapon of the assassin for it hap-
pened that there were a couple of ex-
ploded shells in it consequently every-
body supposed that the westerner had
been the aggressor and that he had cold-
bloodedly shot down an unarmed man

  not realizing how this misunder-
standing had arisen reckless was of
opinion that the situation had been wil-
fully misrepresented to his disadvan-
tage and he congratulated himself that
he had not gone straight to the authori-
ties and given himself up as he would
not have hesitated to do out west

  reckon im mighty lucky that im
still free he muttered and inasmuch
as ive got the price of a ticket back
home i guess im goin to stay free

  police hot on my trail eh he went
on with a scornful glance at the news-
paper headline waal i reckon theyll
lve to jump some in order to get me
its me for the double b first train
out reckon the boysll be some sur-
prised to see me back so soon

  he was proceeding toward the rail-
way station with the intention of de-
parting from new york without even
stopping long enough to go back to his
hotel to pack his kit when happening
to pass a moving-picture show there
suddenly flashed upon his mental vision

a pair of laughing black eyes and a daz-
zling display of pearly- teeth

  there were several lithographed post-
ers outside the show one of them
bore the legend new to-day  great
western drama the cowboys sweet-
heart beneath it was a highly col-
ored picture of a wild westerner clasp-
ing in his arms a slim girlish figure

  it was by no means a flattering like-
ness of ruby holcomb but it was near
enough to the original for reckless to
be able to recognize it and he paused
irresolutely

  and to-morrow mornin up in the
bronx shes goin to be the boss of the
ranch he muttered all her cowboys
are in love with her-and im to be one
of em me give up a chance like that
wriggling rattlesnakes  not much 

  he changed his mind about going to
the railway station instead he entered
a barber shop

  shave or haircut sir inquired the
barber as he deposited his burly form in
a chair

  both replied reckless crop the
hair close to my head and take off this
mustache-every bit of it

chapter v

a trifling drawback

vihen the barber had finished with
him reckless leland gazed at
himself in a mirror and chuckled

  even the boys at double b wouldnt
know me now he said to himself so
i reckon there wont be no danger of
any of those galoots who saw the shoot-
in bein able to recognize me itll be
perfectly safe to stay in new york-
until my hair grows

  so he went back to his hotel and
turned in early partly because he didnt
consider it safe to venture abroad that
night notwithstanding his disguise and
partly because he wanted to have a good
sleep so as to be in proper shape for
the important work of the morrow

  he was up in the bronx the next
morning two hours before the moving-
picture troupe arrived when miss
holcomb stepped onto the long stretch
of pasture which was the nearest ap-


top-notch magazine

proach to a prairie to be found in west-
chester county she stared without rec-
ognition at the close-cropped smooth-
shaven young man who came hurrying
toward her with an eager greeting

  i beg your pardon she said coldly
i think you must be making a mistake

i am quite sure that i havent the pleas-
ure of your acquaintance

  the man who was with her-he of
the red sweater-laughed and said
something under his breath about an-
other moving-picture johnny

  reckless lelands face flushed crim-
son for the moment he had forgotten
his changed appearance and took the
girls attitude for a deliberate snub
then recovering himself he turned to
the man in the red sweater and handed
him the card which mr eddy had given
to him

  reckon your names bates aint it
i was told to give this to you im the
latest addition to this outfit

  at the sound of his voice the girl
started

  why of course i know you she
exclaimed turning apologetically to
reckless how stupid of me not to
recognize you and yet my mistake
isnt surprising considering the change
youve made in yourself since yester-
day what on earth caused you to take
off your mustache

  i-i found it got in the way when
i drank soup stammered reckless

  the man in the red sweater studied
the card which leland had handed him
then looked the new recruit over crit-
ically

  all right i guess i can use you
you can ride a horse of course
tolerably well replied the cowboy
with a grin

  then you can come in this first pic-
ture its a roughriding scene go on
over to the stables and ask mike to let
you have a horse and a cowboy out-
fit

  he pointed as he spoke to a big
barnlike structure on the outskirts of the
prairie and reckless hastened toward
it he found a dozen men there in the
act of donning wild-west garb and a
dozen more making up as indians fotr

the barn served as a dressing room as
well as a stable

  when they had learned that he was
a new addition to the company the
others welcomed him cordially and
mike who had charge of the stables
and supplies fitted him with a costume
and a mount which although not to be
compared with reckless lelands own
black boy at double b ranch was
a tolerably good specimen of horseflesh

  fifteen minutes later the cowboy
band came galloping across the long
grass yelling lustily and waving their
sombreros

  they lined up before miss holcomb
and bates and the latter inspected each
one carefully and nodded

  all right he said guess were
ready to start on scene one he con-
sulted a typewritten sheet of paper
miss holcomb you go over there and
stand on that hill yonder be sure to
keep your profile turned toward the
camera wave your handkerchief and
smile as the boys come on the scene is
cowboys returning from the round-up
the woman boss welcoming them back
get the idea now you fellows beat
it over there to that corner of the field
and when i raise my right hand you all
come racing toward miss holcomb be
sure to keep all in a bunch but make it
look as if each is trying to get ahead of
the rest so as to be the first to reach the
woman boss look at each other and
scowl fiercely as you ride so as to con-
vey the idea that youre all terrible jeal-
ous of each other youre all supposed
to be desperately in love with the ranch-
mans pretty widow you know does
everybody get the picture

  they all nodded to show that they
understood what was required of them
and the cowboy band pranced off to 
distant corner of the field out of range
of the camera while miss holcomb
who was attired in a natty western rid-
ing costume went to take her position on
the knoll and from that eminence
smiled and waved her handkerchief for
ten minutes before she managed to do it
well enough to suit the critical eye o
mr bates

  when that gentleman who was a
his canned drama debut



genius at posing was satisfied with her
efforts he raised his right hand as a sig-
nal for the cowboys to advance and
they came bounding across the field in
close formation doing their best to
carry out the instructions which the man
in the red sweater had given them

   rotten the latter exclaimed re-
garding them with a disapproving scowl
you fellows havent got the spirit of
the thing at all i told you particu-
larly to scowl at each other as you rode
toward the lady boss of the ranch you
dont give the effect of jealousy at all
youre the punkest lot of scowlers i
ever saw try it again

   they galloped back to their corner
and once more came dashing toward the
hillock on which miss holcomb stood
this time taking care to contort their
faces into savage scowls

   still the man in the red sweater was
not satisfied

   it wont do he growled theres
only one of you that has the right idea
the rest are rotten you dont show
nearly enough jealousy try swearing
at each other as you ride-that may
help give you the right expression be
careful what you say though dont
make the cusses too strong lots of
deaf and dumb people go to moving-
picture shows and they can read your
lips use language thats forceful but
not indecent

   they tried it over again and this time
they managed to satisfy bates with their
scowls but he took them to task be-
cause they were so busy scowling that
they neglected to look once toward the
ranchmans widow on the hillock

   intersperse your scowls with affec-
tionate glances at the lady boss-the
woman youre all in love with he said
most of you failed to do that take
off your hats and wave them at miss
holcomb remember shes welcoming
you back from the round-up and youre
all supposed to be tickled to death to see
her scowl and smile-scowl and smile
get the idea

   they tried it over and over again be-
fore they met with the approval of the
man in the red sweater in fact it was
not until they had been rehearsing this

one scene for three solid hours that
bates considered the result good enough
for grinding

   reckless marveled at the mans pa-
tience and his fussiness it had never
entered the westerners mind when he
visited moving-picture shows that so
much painstaking effort was required to
produce the apparently spontaneous mo-
tions which were flashed upon the
screen he had never dreamed that the
pictures had to be rehearsed as much as
this and that so much importance was
attached to apparently trifling details

   once for instance when everything
seemed perfect and bates was just
about to order the man to begin to
grind he suddenly changed his mind
and turned instead to the ranchmans
widow on the hillock

   miss holcomb he shouted ive
got a new idea try waving your hat
in the air instead of your handkerchief
i think thatll give a better effect

   and to lelands great astonishment
and indignation after the girl had
waved her sombrero until her slender
arm must have ached-for even this
trifling change had to be painstakingly
rehearsed-the critic in the red sweater
suddenly changed his mind again

  never mind the hat miss hol-
comb  he shouted guess well stick
to the handkerchief after all i think i
like it better

   at length mr bates was satisfied that
the picture could not be improved upon
he yelled to the camera man to grind
her the latter began to turn the han-
dle of his wonderful apparatus and the
home-coming of the cowboys was re-
corded on several hundred feet of film

   after the picture was finished mr
bates came over to reckless just as the
latter was dismounting

   this is your first experience at mov-
ing pictures isnt it

   yes sir

   how do you like it

   fine replied the westerner en-
thusiastically looking at miss holcomb
out of a corner of his eye

   well you certainly made good de-
clared the stage manager approving-
ly you got the spirit of the scene bet-


top-notch magazine

ter than any of the others what the-
atrical experience have you had

  none at all answered the cowboy
what exclaimed mr bates in un-
feigned astonishment you dont mean
to tell me that youre an amateur
why the way you looked at miss hol-
comb as you came galloping toward her
was great it was exactly the expres-
sion i wanted all those other fellows
are professionals but they didnt man-
age to look nearly as much in love with
the ranchmans widow as you did
waal when it comes to such actin
as that drawled reckless with another
glance toward miss holcomb who
stood a few feet away i reckon im a
natural born actor

  you certainly are assented the man
in the red sweater not perceiving any
special significance in this remark i
dont like to handle amateurs as a gen-
eral rule youre the first one ive
ever taken on that was any good but
i like your work and i guess ill be able
to use you a whole lot

  thanks said reckless joyously
theres one thing however that ill
have to ask of you mr bates went on
whats that

  if you want to appear permanently
in our wild-west scenes youll have to
let your hair grow long

  and youd better grow a mustache
too he added looking at reckless crit-
ically ive got too many smooth-
shaven cowboys

chapter vi

without rehearsal

deckless leland was consid-
erably perturbed regarding the
trifling drawback to his personal ap-
pearance which mr bates had pointed
out it seemed to him that if his con-
tinuance with the moving-picture outfit
depended upon his letting his hair grow
long and wearing a hirsute adornment
on his upper lip he would be compelled
to give up his new career

   he appreciated the peril which such
  a change in his present appearance
  would mean not only would there be
  danger of somebody on the street iden-

tifying him as the man who had fired
the fatal shot in the cafe but also the
moving-picture scenes for which he
posed would be a constant menace to
him

  for these pictures of course would
be exhibited on the screens of several
hundred moving-picture theaters in new
york every week and the chances were
that somebody who had been pres-
ent in the cafe when he had fired that
shot would drop into one of these
places recognize the tall long-haired
coyboy with the mustache in the pic-
ture as the assassin and put the police
on his track

  clean-shaven and close-cropped as he
was at present reckless didnt think
that there was much danger of his be-
ing recognized either in person or in the
pictures but he regarded his undoing
as inevitable if he complied with the
wishes of the fastidious mr bates

  oh well said reckless to himself
maybe he wont press the matter
reckon its only a whim of his and he
may forget to mention it again if so
i sure shant remind him

  reckless acquitted himself so well at
rehearsal next morning that he again
came in for some warm praise from mr
bates who assured him that he was a
natural born actor and predicted a
great future for him in moving pic-
tures

  and to the westerners great relief
bates made no further reference that
day to the shortness of his hair or his
lack of a mustache

  the pictures for which reckless
posed that morning were a continuation
of the story of the previous day the
lady boss of the ranch was proposed to
by each of her adoring cowboys in turn
and gently but firmly informed each one
that there was no hope for him

  as miss holcomb of course was the
lady boss of the ranch it was small
wonder that reckless was able to go
through this scene with an intensity
which made his performance stand out
as a work of art even though his fel-
low cowboys were all professional ac-
tors

  there was only one other cowboy
his canned drama debut



who managed to put into this scene any-
thing like the same amount of fervor
as the westerner this was a little
mexican named lopez who used to
do a comedy bullfight act in vaude-
ville before he joined the moving-pic-
ture company

  lopez in proposing to the pretty
widow managed to display as much
ardor as did reckless and his gestures
of despair when he was turned down
were so  eloquent that he too was
warmly complimented by the man in the
red sweater

  it was not his theatrical experience
which enabled lopez to do so well in
this picture his success was due to
the fact that in this particular scene he
wasnt merely acting for reckless
leland was not the only member of that
moving-picture company who was head
over heels in love with its leading lady

  the westerner did not realize then
however that he had a rival in love in
the little mexican it was not until
later that day that he discovered that
such was the case

  after luncheon the cowboys laid off
while the indians came into the pic-
ture this was the big scene of the
photo play the redskins were to at-
tack the ranch while the cow-punchers
were absent seize the pretty widow tie
her to the back of a pony and bear her
a captive to their camp

  reckless taking care to keep out of
range of the camera stood beside his
mount watching the rehearsal of this
thrilling spectacle with a broad grin
on his face he saw the indians come
creeping stealthily across the prairie
watched them seize the terrified widow
and tie her to the ponys back

  and then just as they were about to
lead their captive away-to be rescued
in the next scene of course by the
faithful-unto-death cowboys something
happened which was not on the pro-
gram-something which caused the
smile to disappear from lelands face
and an exclamation of alarm to escape
from his lips

  scared by the shrill screech of a lo-
comotive whistle from a railroad track
near by the pony suddenly wrenched its

head free from the indian who was
holding it and darted off panic-stricken
across the prairie with ruby hol-
comb lying across its back bound and
helpless

  in an instant every one of those
make-believe cowboys was in the saddle
and dashing off in pursuit of the panic-
stricken beast needless to say reckless
leland was among them

  mr bates bill the camera man and
the redskins-none of these having
horses and therefore being unable to
join in the chase-stood waving their
arms frantically and yelling encourage-
ment to the riders

  theyll never get her groaned
bates perceiving how the distance was
widening between the runaway and the
pursuing band that pony is the best
horse weve got none of those others
can touch him for speed even when hes
in his normal senses and now in his
panic hes twice as fast as ordinary
and hes heading straight for that
high stone fence exclaimed the cam-
era man heavens miss holcomb
will be dashed to pieces

  those fellows cant possibly over-
take him repeated bates despairingly
see how theyre all falling behind al-
ready oh how i wish they were real
cowboys instead of mere actors

  two of them seem to be doing pretty
well said one of the redskins shading
his eyes with his hand look at that
big fellow and the little man beside him
theyre way ahead of the others by
jiminy those two certainly can ride
some

  bates nodded yes thats leland
our new man and the little mexican
lopez if miss holcomb is saved itll
be one of those two wholl do it the
rest of that bunch dont know beans
about riding but even leland and
lopez are too far behind look the
pony is almost at the fence now and it
hasnt changed its course the fool
beast is too blind with fear to realize its
own danger its all over with that poor
little girl too bad she was the best

leading lady weve ever had and-

  theyre right at the fence flow
groaned the camera man shuddering


top-notch magazine

and closing his eyes that means the
finish of course at the speed that
beasts going it cant-

  great caesars ghost broke in
bates joyously hes cleared it
what a jump did you see that bill
that pony went over the fence as easily
as if it hadnt been there miss hol-
combs escaped that danger at least

  the screech of a locomotive whistle
came to their ears the camera man
looked fearfully at bates yes shes
escaped that danger but the railroad
tracks lie a couple of hundred yards
beyond that wall and there seems to
be a train coming if that pony doesnt
change its course miss holcomb might
as well have been dashed against the
fence

  leland and the little mexican riding
like the wind and leaving the rest of
the pursuing band far behind reached
the high stone fence together before
he had gone on the vaudeville stage
lopez had worked on a ranch and like
leland he knew how to get the utmost
speed out of a mount blit when he ar-
rived at the high wall over which the
pony with the helpless girl tied to its
back had disappeared the mexicans
nerve failed him to attempt that jump
seemed madness he gazed at the ob-
stacle with blinking eyes and instinc-
tively reined in his mount so sharply
that the beast rose on its haunches

  and as he halted there eager but
afraid reckless leland passed him by
and leaping the fence continued the
chase alone

  the runaway pony was less than
three feet from the railroad tracks
when reckless drew alongside and
brought the frightened beast to a stop
just as a fast freight went rattling past

  miss holcomb had fainted but she
opened her eyes as her rescuer began
untying the rope which bound her to the
ponys back and to lelands great sur-
prise and admiration when he had re-
leased her she jumped to the ground
with a brave laugh

  that was a close call she said
when i saw that train coming i
thought i was done for youve saved
my life mr leland lets go back

now and continue the rehearsal its a
good thing we werent grinding when
this silly pony ran away otherwise wed
have spoiled a film

  spoiled a film gasped reckless
 wriggling rattlesnakes you sure have
got grit little girl i never before met
a woman with such pluck

  the girl laughed again do you
think so im afraid im not very
brave-or i shouldnt have fainted i
ought to be used to such accidents by
this time we go through so many of
them you know in the moving-picture
business i was almost drowned a cou-
ple of weeks ago when we were making
a picture on the hudson river i
jumped overboard-tied to a rope-and
the rope broke and i went down twice
before mr bates jumped in and
grabbed me and the other day i was
overcome by sulphur fumes we were
doing a fire picture in a little cottage in
yonkers which we filled with pots of
sulphur to make thick clouds of smoke
you know and when i rushed in to res-
cue my stage baby i wras really over-
powered and they had to get a doctor
to bring me to oh yes ive had so
many thrilling experiences since i went
into moving pictures that i oughtnt to
be scared at anything any more

  when they returned to the prairie
they were received with cheers mr
bates bill the camera man the red-
skins and the cowboys gathered around
reckless and wrung his hand

  but there was one man who did not
take part in this tribute to the rescuer
lopez the little mexican stood some
distance away scowling at the west-
erner and encountering the look of
hatred in his rivals eyes reckless real-
ized that he was not the only man in
that outfit who was in love with the
leading lady

chapter vii

a great temptation

the next three weeks were very
 pleasant ones for reckless leland
everything seemed to be coming his
way
his canned drama debut



    in the first place he continued to do
 so well at his new job that mr bates
 assured him that it would not be long
 before he was out of the chorus class
 and able to play individual roles in
 fact the latter was so pleased with his
 work he predicted that reckless would
 one day rise to the eminence of a mov-
 ing-picture star

   the westerner was filled with delight
 -lit this prospect not that a canned-
 drama career appealed to him particu-
 larly for itself alone but because he saw
 in such promotion a chance to play op-
 posite to the leading lady

   the man who enjoyed this great
 privilege at the present time was a good-
 looking chap named morton mallory
 who had stepped from a forty-dollar-a-
 week job with a theatrical road show
 into a seventy-dollar position as leading
 man with the pendexter moving pic-
 ture company

   mallory greatly appreciated the dif-
 ference in salary for there was a wife
 and several little mallorys to feed but
 he didnt seem to realize the other and
 -in reckless lelands opinion-far
 more important advantages that went
 with the new job every day he would
 hold miss ruby holcomb in his arms in
 front of the moving-picture camera
 sometimes maintaining that enviable po-
 sition for a solid hour before the fas-
 tidious mr bates considered the scene
 artistic enough to grind

   sometimes the moving-picture girl
 would throw her slender arms around
 his neck sometimes she would pillow
 her pretty head upon his shoulder in
 one or two particularly affectionate
 scenes she kissed him-doing it over
 and over again until the gentleman in
 the red sweater deemed the osculatory
 effort good enough to be made into film

   and all these things mr morton mal-
 colm took quite as a matter of course-
 or rather as a mere matter of business
 it was quite evident that he was not at
 all thrilled by such proximity with the
 pretty leading lady in fact he had
 once or twice been heard to complain at
 the length of the rehearsals and to
 express himself as being exceedingly
 bored while reckless leland watch-

 ingthese poses with envious eyes felt
 that he would have given his right hand
 for one such chance

  thus far the roles which the west-
erner had filled had been sadly barren
of such opportunities in one or two
scenes he had enjoyed the privilege of
holding the leading ladys hand for a
brief moment but even such slight bliss
as this came seldom most of the time
he merely did chorus work-riding with
the other cow-punchers to the rescue of
the girl who had been kidnaped by in-
dians or acting as one of the lynching
party about to string up the hero whose
life was saved by the heroine just in the
nick of time

  and of course when the heroine
dashed up to the rescue on a foam-
flecked steed she didnt kiss the lynch-
ers-she always threw her arms around
the neck of the condemned man and
even when she was rescued from the
redskins by the intrepid cowboys she
didnt express her gratitude by hugging
them all she invariably fell fainting
into the anus of the hero and let it go
at that

  and that was why reckless leland
was so much pleased by mr bates as-
surance that it would not be long before
he would graduate from this group
work to more important roles he
yearned for that day to arrive

  but in the meantime although he
wasnt given any chance to make love
to the leading lady in front of the mov-
ing-picture camera reckless was swift-
ly winning his way into miss holcombs
good graces-in real life

  since the day that he had saved her
life the moving-picture girls attitude
toward him had been frankly cordial
and they had become quite chummy
she had even invited him to call on her
at her apartment on a sunday afftr-
noon which invitation needless to say
reckless leland had eagerly accepted
and he had made the acquaintance of
her mother and sisters and quaffed tea
brewed by ruby holcombs own hand

  thus everything was going very
nicely with the westerner and he would
have been very happy-if it hadnt been
for a realization of the fact that he was


top-notch magazine

a fugitive from justice that realiza-
tion was never long from his mind it
kept him continuously uneasy it wasnt
that his conscience troubled him the
knowledge that he had been forced to
fire that shot to prevent himself from
being killed saved him from seizures of
remorse

  nor was it the fear of being discov-
ered which kept him uneasy it was be-
cause possessing an open straightfor-
ward nature it went very much against
his grain to have to skulk and dodge the
vengeance of the law so obnoxious
was this role of fugitive that several
times he was on the point of giving him-
self up to the police but each time he
recalled that unfair account of the trag-
edy which he had read in the newspaper
and he told himself that there was no
chance of his getting a square deal if he
took this step so he decided to remain
in obscurity

  so far as his being discovered was
concerned he had very little fear of
that as the days went by he felt more
and more safe he passed policemen
on the street and although every mem-
ber of the force had been furnished with
a description of the fugitive they stared
at him without a sign of recognition

  they had been instructed to watch
out for a man with long hair and a
heavy mustache and therefore it did
not occur to them to suspect this clean-
shaven close-cropped young man of be-
ing the fellow they wanted

  even the persons present in the cafe
that night wouldnt have recognized him
if they had seen him for the lack of a
mustache and long hair makes a great
difference in a mans appearance and
reckless took the precaution to shave
his upper lip every morning and keep
the hair upon his head very short

  mr bates since that single occasion
when he had imparted to reckless his
prejudice against close-cropped clean-
shaven cowboys had not again referred
to the subject like most geniuses that
gentleman was erratic things that he
considered of all importance one day he
forgot all about the next his objec-
tion to reckless scarcity of hair had
been merely a passing whim

  but one day the matter of hair and
mustache came up again in a manner
which sorely tried reckless lelands
soul morton mallory the leading man
was laid up with a bad attack of grippe
and sent word to mr bates that he
couldnt come to work bates was
greatly annoyed at this message he
was about to start work on a brand-new
play that day and there were reasons
why the film had to be rushed through
without delay

  ill have to get somebody else to play
his part he growled to miss holcomb
its too bad because this is to be one
of the biggest things weve ever put
over and i havent got anybody who
measures up to the leading male part
nearly as well as mallory

  his gaze swept the group of actors
who played secondary roles no
none of those fellowsll do they
havent got the presence for this particu-
lar part mallory was just the man for
it i suppose ill have to telephone one
of the agencies to send out a new lead-
ing man-and i hate to book with stran-
gers especially in a big production like
this

  why not try one of the chorus
suggested miss holcomb glancing to-
ward the group of cowboys and in-
dians who stood some distance off

  no im afraid they wouldnt do
some of them look more like the part
but i need a good actor and none of
those fellows are clever enough

  how about mr leland said miss
holcomb quickly youve always said
that hes got talent and is too good for
the chorus why not give him a chance
to show what he can do 

  humph muttered bates staring
hard at the westerner leland cer-
tainly looks the part hes big and
strapping as far as appearances go
hes almost a better man than mallory
for this role but im afraid he hasnt

had enough experience and-

  try him broke in the leading lady
eagerly from what ive seen of his
work i feel sure that hed be able to
pull through he may need a lot of re-
hearsing but hell be able to manage it
all right
his canned drama debut



  bates glanced again at the western-
ers burly figure by george miss
holcomb i think ill follow your sug-
gestion that fellow certainly does
look the goods

  he walked through the long grass to
where reckless stood leland im
going to give you the chance of your
lifetime to-day mallory is sick and
ive decided to try you in his place in
this new play were putting on do
you think you could do it theres a

big love scene and-

  try me exclaimed reckless eager-
ly without waiting to hear any more
say boss out at double b ranch ive
got a hoss named black boy which no
amount of money could buy from me
but if i dont make good in this part ill
make you a present of that hoss and
pay his freight to the east in the bar-
gain

  mr bates smiled at his enthusiasm
all right ill accept that offer but i
hope the horse stays at double b le-
land he took some sheets of type-
writing from his pocket ill read you
the scenario of the play and youll un-
derstand whats required of you its
called the horse thief and--

  he broke off suddenly and glanced
at the westerners face oh by the
way youll have to wear a wig and mus-
tache the part calls for a chap with
long dark hair and a heavy growth on
his upper lip that smooth face and
close-cropped hair of yours wont do at
all

  long hair and a mustache gasped
reckless turning pale im afraid i

couldnt wear them boss i-

  you must interrupted bates re-
garding him with astonishment
theyre part of the plot the story
hinges on them as youll see when ive
read you the scenario surely it cant

make any difference to you what-

  i couldnt do it boss declared
reckless shaking his head emphatically
ive got a certain prejudice against
hair which aint to be put aside even
for a chance like this

  bates frowned this is the most ab-
surd thing ive ever heard leland
what can be your objection are you

joking with me if so cut out the
comedy my friend because i havent
any time for kidding

  but reckless shook his head again
it was quite apparent from the expres-
sion of misery on his face that he was
very much in earnest he realized that
even though the long hair was only a
wig and the mustache a false one he
would look in these things almost ex-
actly as he had appeared that night in
the cafe when he had fired that fatal
shot

  and brief as would be the time in
which he would have to wear them it
would be long enough in all probabil-
ity to lead to his detection for the films
for which he posed would be exhibited
at several hundred moving-picture the-
aters throughout the city and the
chances were that somebody would rec-
ognize him on the screen as the man
who had done the shooting

  come cried bates impatiently and
with an angry frown im not going
to waste any time arguing with you if
you dont want the part ill find some-
body else its doubtful whether youd
have made good anyway i wouldnt
have thought of even trying you if miss
holcomb hadnt suggested it

  a look of mingled astonishment and
joy came to the westerners face she
suggested it  he exclaimed and
glanced over to where the moving-pic-
ture girl stood

  she was too far away to hear their
conversation but she  was looking to-
ward them evidently wondering what
all the argument was about and as
reckless gazed over in her direction
their eyes met

  shell be in the picture of course
he said hoarsely turning to bates

  of course she will miss holcombs
to be the sweetheart of the horse thief
thats the part i was going to try you

in but-

  go on boss

  the sheriff and his posse have
tracked the horse thief to his sweet-
hearts cabin and while hes inside

holding her in his arms they-

  all right mr bates cried leland
ill take that part-no matter what

happens afterward wherell i get that
wig and mustache 

chapter viii

a star role

the first part of the horse thief
was done up at the bronx prairie
but the cabin scene being an interior
was made in the moving picture com-
panys indoor studio at the main offices

  after they had got through posing in
the open air which took one whole day
and half of another reckless leland
miss holcomb and those of the actors
who were to appear in the cabin scene
jumped into an automobile and ac-
companied by mr bates proceeded to
the studio

  while the car was speeding through
the city the westerner took the precau-
tion of removing the wig and false mus-
tache with which mike the property
man had supplied him for he did not
care to run the additional risk of being
recognized en route by some vigilant po-
liceman

  this was the first time reckless had
ever posed for an indoor picture or had
ever been inside the studio in which
such scenes are made he was aston-
ished at what he saw there and half
blinded by the glaring green lights al-
ways used for interior work

  all kinds of scenery was to be found
stacked up in this room but instead of
being in more or less natural colors as
is the scenery of the ordinary stage it
was all in black and white a corps of
stage carpenters were busily hammer-
ing together a structure of canvas at
one end of the room and reckless saw
at a glance that this was the cabin
in which the horse thief was to visit
his sweetheart while the sheriff and his
posse were waiting outside to hang him

  all ready now mr bates said the
boss of the carpenters hammering a last
nail into place as they approached

  bates inspected the interior of the
cabin with a critical eye

  pretty good effect he commented
but we need some more pictures on
the walls tack up a few lithographs-
the kind of stuff a rough western girl

would use to decorate her den and that
ceiling looks too new this isnt the liv-
ing room of a new york apartment its
the tumble-down shack of a poor west-
ern family smear up the ceiling and
knock some holes in the plaster smash
out a couple of panes of glass in that
window too and nail rough boards
across and take out that table who
ever heard of mahogany furniture in a
log cabin  bring in that plain pine
table over there instead thatll serve
much better

  these changes having been made the
moving-picture camera was adjusted
and the strong green lights were fo-
cused on reckless and miss holcomb
who took their places inside the shack

  in the greenish glare of the lights
miss holcombs complexion looked
ghastly but that didnt lessen the joy
of reckless leland when she flew into
his arms and rested her head on his
broad shoulder

  he forgot then that he was posing
before a camera forgot that he was in a
fake cabin made of canvas forgot that
the girl in his arms was only playing a
part-that this was nothing more than
her daily work and that while she snug-
gled against his shoulder she was taking
care to keep her face turned toward the
photographers lens and wondering
anxiously whether the love light in her
eyes would show properly on the film

  reckless forgot all these things and
forgot too that he was wearing a wig
and a false mustache which might prove
extremely disastrous for him he was
living that scene not acting it and he
put his big arms around the girls slen-
der form and hugged her so tightly that
he nearly squeezed the breath out of
her

  very good cried mr bates ap-
provingly very good indeed youve
got it almost good enough to grind right
now but a little more fervor mr le-
land a little more fervor remember
youre supposed to be desperately in
love with the girl try to show it on
your face

  a little more fervor ye gods and
little fishes if he didnt show he loved
her on his face right then thought
his canned drama debut



reckless he must be suffering from fa-
cial paralysis

  take your head from his shoulder
miss holcomb and try looking up into
his face instead suggested bates
give him the goo-goo eyes you know
how i mean

  reckless gazed into those big brown
eyes which the girl obediently focused
upon his and he trembled with joy at
the love he saw in their depths

  fine cried mr bates with great
enthusiasm perfectly splendid mal-
lory couldnt have done it any better
hold that expression mr leland i
wont keep you waiting long were
going to grind it out right now

  he turned to the camera man let
her go bill we couldnt get it any bet-
ter than that if we rehearsed em for a
hundred years

  and as the camera hegan to whir re-
cording this love scene on several hun-
dred feet of film reckless holding the
girl in his arms and gazing into her up-
turned face continued to maintain the
expression which had wrung such warm
praise from the artistic soul of mr
bates

  suddenly the camera stopped and
reckless became conscious of a jarring
voice which said thats all thank
you mr leland the pictures fin-
ished-and im willing to bet right now
that itll be a beaut

  the jarring voice was that of mr
bates and it announced the end of those
few minutes of bliss

  thats all mr leland said miss
holcomb in a most matter-of-fact tone
dont you hear that the grinding is
done  no need to hold me any longer
and she slipped out of his arms and
stepped out of the canvas walls of the
shanty and walking over to a mirror
calmly began to arrange her much-dis-
ordered hair

  for a few seconds leland still stood
there as though dazed his complexion
a ghastly green from the strong spot-
lights although there was plenty of red
blood in his face at that particular mo-
ment

  then he came slowly out of the cabin
chuckling to himself and to think

he muttered that i get paid five dollars
for doing that

chapter ix

the penalty

morton mallorys attack of
grippe didnt prove as serious as
he had feared he came back to work
in a couple of days and reckless re-
turned to his job in the chorus and
had no more opportunities-for some
days at least-to act love scenes with
miss holcomb

  he had done so well in the horse
thief however that mr bates had
promised to promote him as soon as
there was a vacancy in the ranks of the
actors who played more important parts
therefore the westerner was not with-
out hope

  and in the meantime outside of the
world of make-believe he was continu-
ing to make great headway in his woo-
ing of the moving-picture girl he
hadnt yet got to the point of being able
to muster up the courage to repeat in
real life that blissful scene which he
and she had enacted under the glaring
green lights of the studio and he hadnt
been able to inspire that exprefsion on
her face which had been there when he
had held her in his arms and she had
looked up into his eyes before the whir-
ring camera but he and she had become
the best of friends and he was a fre-
quent caller now at the pretty little
apartment uptown there miss hol-
comb served him tea out of the daintiest
of china cups or fed him wonderful
concoctions which she made in a chaf-
ing dish

  and during working hours up at the
bronx prairie her manner toward him
was so cordial and she bestowed upon
him so many smiles that the rest of the
company soon began to take notice and
to exchange significant grins-all ex-
cept the little mexican lopez whose
face grew longer each day and whose
scowl grew darker every time he looked
at reckless leland

  one evening about three weeks after
the making of the horse thief pic-
ture miss holcomb and her twelve-


top-notch magazine

year-old sister marjorie were walking
through west fourteenth street when
they passed a moving-picture theater
outside which wrere several highly col-
ored lithographs announcing the good
things to be seen inside for a dime one
of the posters bore this legend

pendexter companys latest
and best

the horse thief

  stirring western drama of love and heroism
full of action and pathos dont fail to see
this film you cant afford to miss it

  lets go in said miss holcomb to
her sister i havent seen myself on a
screen for months besides theres one
picture theyre showing here im par-
ticularly interested in

  they entered the darkened audito-
rium and sat watching other films and
listening to illustrated songs for an hour
before the title plate of the horse
thief was flashed on the screen

  miss holcomb viewed these pictures
-the productions of rival film concerns
-with a hypercritical eye and fre-
quently made whispered comments to
her sister as to the defects she found in
the posing for the canned-drama ar-
tiste has the same weakness as the act-
ress of the ordinary stages-she cannot
refrain from knocking the work of a
rival performer when she sits in
front

  but when at length the horse
thief was put on the pendexter com-
panys leading lady ceased to whisper
and sat watching the progress of the
film with great interest

  she was not so absorbed in the pic-
ture play however that she failed to
notice the remarks of two men who oc-
cupied seats directly in front of her and
her sister

  these men-not suspecting the iden-
tity of the girl who sat behind them-
did not trouble to lower their voices
when they commented to each other on
the appearance of the horse thiefs de-
voted sweetheart

  aint she a peach bill  said one ad-

miringly would you leave your happy
home for her

  in a minute answered bill prompt-
ly say id give a whole lot to know
the original of that picture pete ive
a good mind to go around to the office
of the company that made that film and
try to get acquainted

  little marjorie holcomb giggled and
nudged her big sister in the ribs did
you hear that sis theres a chance
for you

  miss holcomb smiled hush  dont
let them hear you or theyll look
around shewhispered

  a few seconds later one of the men
said something- that caused both girls
to lean forward in their seats eagerly
and the amused smile vanished from
the elder girls face

  say bill said pete pointing to-
ward the screen whos that fellow
with the long hair and mustache in the
picture  his face looks familiar to
me

  and to me too replied bill i
seem to know him and yet i cant ex-
actly place him i guess we must have
seen him in other pictures and thats
why his face is familiar

  but pete shook his head no im
pretty sure that ive seen him some-
where in real life i wouldnt swrear to
it but ive got an idea that ive met
him now where was it

  suddenly as the horse thief on the
screen came into the foreground of the
picture and stood life size facing the
audience the man addressed as bill
emitted an excited exclamation pete
youre right ive got him placed now
that night in the cafe when the murder
was committed thats where we saw
him

  sure exclaimed the other equally
excited thats the fellow that did the
shooting im wilhng to swear to it
they arose and left the theater hur-
riedly not waiting to see the finish of
the picture

  little marjorie holcomb nudged her
sister did you hear what they said
about mr leland sis can it be pos-
sible that-

  hush whispered the elder girl her
his canned drama debut	

face very pale yes i heard what
they said but of course it isnt true
people are always recognizing the char-
acters in moving pictures as persons
they think they know ive had lots of
letters from men and women who are
quite sure that im their long-lost daugh-
ter or sister those men have made
a ridiculous mistake come on mar-
jorie lets go home

  will you say anything to mr le-
land about what weve heard sis in-
quired the little girl as they left the
theater

  oh no of course not replied miss
holcomb its too ridiculous to repeat
besides it might hurt his feelings
nevertheless when she saw reckless
the following morning at the bronx
prairie she did mention the matter to
him

  i heard a funny thing last night mr
leland she said with a nervous laugh
i dropped into a moving-picture show
with my little sister and they were
showing the horse thief there were
a couple of men in front of us and
when you came onto the screen they
thought they recognized you they
spoke about a murder in a cafe and they
said you were the man who did the
shooting isnt that a good joke

  she was watching his face intently as
she spoke and she saw how he changed
color

  its all up with me now said reck-
less to himself of course those fel-
lows have gone to the police with their
information by this time and ill be
nabbed for sure-probably before an-
other hour has passed i knew trouble
would come of my wearing that mus-
tache and wig i had my fun and now
i reckon ive got to pay the penalty
suddenly it occurred to him that
there was still time to save himself he
was free as yet and there was no reason
why he shouldnt remain free-if he
acted quickly

  he had enough money in his pocket
to pay his fare out west if he left at
once he could be on the train and speed-
ing toward double b ranch before the
police realized that he had made his es-
cape and even if they got on his track

and followed him out there-well the
boys at the ranch wouldnt give him up
without a struggle

  of course i know theres no truth
in what those men said exclaimed miss
holcomb breaking in upon his medita-
tions she tried to speak confidently
but in spite of herself there was a tre-
mor in her voice i simply mentioned
it to you mr leland because it struck
me as being such a-a good joke

  its the funniest thing ive ever
heard responded reckless with a
harsh laugh then he held out his hand
to her well good-by miss holcomb
ive got to attend to a little personal
matter out of town so i reckon i cant

stay to-day to take part in--

  he was interrupted by mr bates
who came up to them with a scowl upon
his face and a telegram in his hand

  good morning mr leland heres
another big chance for you ive just
heard from mallory that hes got an-
other attack of the grippe and cant get
up here to-day confound that fellow
hes always getting sick  so im think-
ing of putting you in his place

  sorry began reckless but i cant

possibly-

  you did that love business with miss
holcomb in the horse thief so well
bates went on unheeding the interrup-
tion that i think youre just the man
for the star role in the new play were
starting to-day theres a big love

scene in it and-

  cant possibly do it boss broke in
reckless leland hoarsely ive got to

leave-

  he stopped short and looked at miss
holcomb a great yearning in his gaze
oh for the joy of holding her once
more in his arms-to have her face
raised toward his life and liberty
suddenly seemed to him inconsequential
matters compared to such happiness

  and after all he told himself weak-
ly there was a chance that those fellows
hadnt gone to the police with their in-
formation it was possible that they
had changed their minds and decided
that they were mistaken in their identi-
fication

  or even if they had not changed their


top-notch magazine

minds there was a chance that they had
not gone to the police as yet maybe
they had put it off until to-day in which
case it would be safe for him to delay
his flight until he had availed himself of
this tempting opportunity which bates
held out to him

  leland looked at the girl he loved
again and proved himself deserving of
the nickname which his comrades at
double b had bestowed upon him

  all right he said to bates i had
an important engagement which called
for my leaving town right away but i
reckon itll haveto keep until after weve
done this film

chapter x

a stirring scene

hphis play said mr bates referring
to his typewritten scenario is
called the quarrel its all in the open
air so we can make it out here theres
a shooting in the first picture the girl
quarrels with her lover and in her tem-
per pulls a gun and fires three shots at
him they all miss and-well ill tell
you the rest afterward thats enough to
go on with miss holcomb and leland
get ready for the first scene

  within fifteen minutes reckless and
the leading lady were ready to begin the
rehearsal the girl had come to the
grounds dressed for the part and le-
land had gone to the dressing room and
hastily donned the western costume
which the part called for

  go and take your places near that
big tree mr bates instructed them
miss holcomb wheres your gun
havent got one eh well one of you
fellows hand her yours

  every member of the chorus all of
them dressed as cowboys ready to come
into the scene later on reached for his
six-shooter loaded with blanks which
went with the costume but the little
mexican lopez was the first to draw
his weapon from his belt

  the mexicans face was very pale
and there was a queer glint in his eyes
as with a graceful bow he handed the
revolver to miss holcomb but no-
body noticed these symptoms and the

girl thanked him with a smile as she
took the weapon

  now said bates glancing at the
typewritten sheets in his hand you
walk toward each other as the picture
opens and embrace each other with
much fervor dont forget to put gin-
ger into it youre a pair of lovers you
know and mighty glad to see each
other

  suddenly a letter falls from your
pocket leland miss holcomb as she
lies in your arms spies it breaks away
from you and picks it up its in a
womans handwriting you snatch it
out of her hand before she can read it
your face shows that you are very
much flustered dont forget that-
very much flustered

 miss holcomb demands to know
whats in the letter you refuse to tell
her she becomes angry you plead
with her she wont listen she walks
away from you you call after her and
step toward her your arms outstretched
she whips a revolver from her dress
and shoots at you three times she
misses you shake your head sadly
and walk slowly away out of the pic-
ture the girl penitent covers her face
with her hands and bursts into tears 
but you dont look behind you and shes
too proud to call you back thats the
end of scene one lets get to it

  eagerly leland stepped forward to
enact the first part of this scene miss
holcomb flew into his arms and he held
her tight and in that embrace he for-
got the peril which menaced him and
wished that that pose could last forever

  say something to her yelled mr
bates speak to her as you hold her
in your arms leland youre not sup-
posed to be deaf and dumb you know
lovers generally talk when they meet
keep on hugging but say something
too

  i love you said reckless with a
tenseness which would have done credit
to the greatest of matinee idols i
love you little girl i may never see you
again after to-day but ive got to tell
you that before i go

  great stuff exclaimed mr bates
enthusiastically those words dont
his canned drama debut



exactly belong in the play for youre not
supposed to be going anywhere you
know-but theyll look just right in the
film the facial expression is splendid
now pass on to the letter incident
reckless obediently dropped an en-
velope from his pocket to the grass and
the girl picked it up and they went
through a quarrel scene with a realism
which won the hearty approval of mr
bates

 fine the latter exclaimed
youre both doing so well that well
need very little rehearsing now for
the shooting scene understand miss
holcomb you retreat from him slowly
and turning fire three shots at him as
he comes after you dont forget that
youre beside yourself with rage make
your face show it leland stretch out
your arms pleadingly as you step to-
ward her

  miss holcomb giving reckless a look
of withering scorn walked off several
yards away from him even though
her back was now turned toward the
camera she made it evident by her car-
riage that she was exceedingly angry

  reckless calling after her and
stretching out his arms entreatingly ad-
vanced toward her at his call she
turned and facing the camera a won-
derfully well-simulated expression of
fury on her countenance whipped out
her revolver and fired at him-once
twice three times

  and at the third shot reckless spun
around and sank to the ground

 hey not that cried bates
what are you doing leland that
isnt in the play you dont get shot
you idiot she misses you every time
but miss holcomb ran toward reck-
less with a frenzied cry and kneeling
beside him pillowed his head in her
arms ive killed him ive killed
him she moaned and added some-
what inconsistently  oh get a doctor
somebody please hurry

  bates realizing that this was genuine
tragedy knelt beside the stricken man
and put his ear to his chest then he
turned to the group of horrified actors
who had gathered around he isnt
dead he said i dont know how

badly hes hurt but he still lives yes
hurry up and telephone for a doctor
some of you dont stand there gap-
ing like a lot of idiots

  suddenly spying the little mexican
lopez hanging back on the outskirts of
the throng bates addressed him sharp-
ly  you handed her that gun how do
you explain that it contained bullets in-
stead of blanks

  i-i dont know stammered the
mexican his face livid they-they
must have got in there by accident
reckless opening his eyes in a few
minutes was surprised to find miss hol-
comb bending over him her face close
to his as he looked up into her eyes
he saw in them an expression which
made him think that he was still posing
in a love scene for the camera

  just at that moment two men thick-
set short-necked and square of jaw
came across the grass and pushed their
way through the group of cowboys

  excuse us for buttin in on this pic-
ture boss said one addressing mr
bates but i guess youve got a man
here by the name of leland-and if so
we want him for homicide

  as he spoke he pulled back his coat
and displayed a badge fastened to his
suspender-the badge of a central of-
fice detective

chapter xi

good news

ljearing these words the little
  mexican lopez was very sorry
that he had handed that gun to miss
holcomb he had put the bullets in the
gun because crazed by the westerners
growing favor with the leading lady
he had made up his mind to find a
chance to kill reckless leland some time
during that days posing

  his first intention had been to do the
shooting himself but when he had
heard mr bates select leland for the
leading role and had learned that the
scenario required the heroine to shoot
at the hero it had occurred to his in-
genious mind that to hand the weapon
to miss holcomb and have her bring


top-notch magazine

about the demise of his rival would be
a great improvement upon his original
crude plan

   but now that he learned that leland
was a fugitive from justice and that
these officers had come to put him be-
hind bars and perhaps start him on his
way to the electric chair he realized that
he had acted too hastily what is the
use of going to the trouble of shooting
a rival in love when the law is ready to
get ridof him for you

   therefore mr lopez was greatly re-
lieved when reckless staggered to his
feet thus showing that he was not mor-
tally wounded the bullet which had
entered his breast near the left shoul-
der had lodged in a cushion of muscle
and although the force of the shot had
been sufficient to knock him out momen-
tarily his injury was not severe

  im the man you want he said to
the detectives i reckon it was those
fellows who saw me on the screen at the
moving-picture show last night who
tipped you off where to find me eh 
one of the officers nodded yes
thats how we got wise to you we
went to the main office of the pendex-
ter company this morning identified
you from the film and was told that
wed find you out here

   and a big fool you were not to give
yourself up right at the start leland
said the other officer instead of giving
us all this trouble

   but of course said miss holcomb
to the detectives those men are mis-
taken mr leland isnt a murderer
im quite sure of that she turned
anxiously to reckless it is a mistake
isnt it you didnt shoot that man in
the cafe it was some one that resem-
bled you wasnt it

   the westerner shook his head gloom-
ily no those fellows were quite
right it was me that did the shooting
but i want you to believe that it wasnt
murder-at least not as we understand
the term out west i had to kill that
fellow in self-defense he had the drop
on me and there was only a part of a
second to make up my mind i decided
that id rather shoot than be shot-so i
fired first

  no corrected one of the detectives
youre slightly wrong there leland it
was that crook who fired first but his
gun hung fire-arid before he could pull
the trigger again you dropped him
reckless scarcely believing that he
could have heard aright stared at the
man in astonishment yes thats
true he said but wriggling rattle-
snakes  how in blazes do you know it
the detective chuckled a little
bird told us-or rather two little birds
there were two chaps in the cafe that
night who sat at the next table to yours
and saw the whole thing they dropped
into headquarters yesterday morning
and told us just how it happened
but why didnt they speak up before
yesterday  demanded reckless

  they were afraid to you see they
are both married men and afraid of
their wives-you know that kind-and
they hadnt ought to have been in that
-cafe that night they had told their
better halves that they was at a y m
c a meeting or something of that
sort and they were afraid to come for-
ward with what they knew for fear of
getting into trouble at home but their
conscience had been troubling them and
yesterday they decided to come out with
the truth regardless of the conse-
quences were convinced that theyre
telling the truth too for the gun we
found under the table and which we
supposed at first was yours has since
been identified as having belonged to the
mah who was killed

  miss holcomb heaved a sigh of relief
in that case then why are you arrest-
ing him for murder she asked

  not murder miss-merely homi-
cide corrected the detective thats
nothing but a technical charge you
see even though he shot in self-defense
the fact remains that he took a human
life so we have to place him under ar-
rest

  but there wont be nothin to it he
added reassuringly when he tells his
story in court and its corroborated by
these new witnesses hes sure to be ex-
onerated

  oh im glad to hear that said the

learning to talk at twenty-five

a man learning to talk at the age o
twenty-five years at the same time
that his infant daughter was trying to
form syllables and words seems a para-
dox but such was the experience of
harry j scott of goshen orange
county new york moreover it took
him five years to learn

  scott was a clerk in a goshen gro-
cery about six years ago he was a
member of the cataract engine com-
pany of the goshen fire department
the company had bought some new ap-
paratus and was testing it in the village
street when something broke and a
piece of iron struck scott on the head
with such force that it depressed a sec-
tion of his skull and the piece of bone
pressed on the brain scott was un-
conscious for days

  doctor frederick seward doctor
dennis and doctor condit who at-
tended him agreed there was but one
chance in a thousand for the man to re-
cover the piece of bone was removed
and then fitted into place again the
lacerated brain cells were treated anti-
septically and results awaited

  at the end of two weeks conscious-
ness gradually returned food was
given by artificial means for a time
then little by little strength seemed to
return and he could swallow normally

  but though consciousness had re-
turned the power of speech had not
the man could not utter a syllable
at intervals he would seem to try to
speak the doctors could find no or-
ganic impediment to speech after a
feisfc months following some premoni-
tory symptoms the mans lips moved in
sound it was not a syllable or a word
but it was a sound he was encour-
aged to repeat the effort and one day
he formed a syllable or two in turn
more syllables and in time by dint of
much patience and encouragement and
effort one-syllable words were spoken

  the doctors decided the injury had
affected one side of the section of the
brain controlling the organs of speech
they say that it is known to the med-
ical fraternity that in such a case the
remaining side in time will take over
little by little the functions or a share
of the functions belonging to the other
side hence the mans gradual recov-
ery of the power of speech

  by the time he was able to form poly-
syllable words and short sentences his
daughter ruth who was born shortly
after the accident to her father began
to learn to talk it was strange to hear
the grown man with other faculties in-
tact even to the extent of being able to
read papers and books intelligently and
write normally lisping words and
phrases the same as the child the two
were inseparable and learned to talk
together progress was more rapid
with the child than the father

  after a couple of years scott was
able to resume his work as a clerk in
the grocery his speaking vocabulary
was limited but as he waited on cus-
tomers and used the words he had
learned it increased fluency and ease
of speaking came slowly

  there was a halting hesitation about
every utterance it was as if the man
were trying to recall a forgotten some-
thing to grasp a lost faculty patience
and practice however made for con-
stant though slow improvement and
gradually fluency and ease began to
come

  through the remaining months and
years down to the present it has con-
tinued but only recently has mr
scotts power of speech become nor-
mal to-day he talks as easily and
fluently as he ever did and no one who
does not know him would ever suspect
his strange experience the little
daughter that learned to talk with her
father is now a bright-eyed schoolgirl

  	the hunter and the game

he calm white dfesert was slip-
ping away under the stars
mr cole detective smiled
and touched the water in a
linger bowl which the waiter
had just set before him

  so youd like to know he said to
the young man opposite how it hap-
pens that ive been on this train since
we left denver-a day and a half ago
-and you havent seen me until now
well i think ill put the answer up to
you he went on a bantering light in
his eye does it occur to you that
youve been owning that observation
platform ever since we hit the royal
gorge who is she maddern
justin maddern leaned across the lit-
tle table and spoke in a low tone i
was fortunate enough to do her a favor
at the station in denver and before
wed been three hours out-well we
have been hogging that observation end
i admit youll laugh cole but hon-
estly i never had a girl affect me so seri-
ously before

  the detectives glance was of mingled
pity and contempt the words from a
man like maddern did not ring true

  she is an attractive girl cole ad-
mitted and i was fortunate enough to
see your gallant act at the station it
really astonished me so i watched you
two im interested in developments
thats one of my hobbies

  we sat out on the platform until
two this morning maddern went on
i think the mountains and the moon-
light had a lot to do with the affair
anyway we arrived at the point of ex-
changing personal history shes bound
for some place in arizona

  cole put a bill on the waiters tray
this is on me maddern now please

dont argue you were saying-

  her names neva and shes bound
for arizona

  what else

  thats all i mean thats all that
could possibly interest you maddern
suddenly frowned i say cole you
didnt by any chance get commissioned
by my father to shadow me did y
you admit you need it cole asked
amused

  lii admit i have needed it maddern
returned grinning and i guess the
governor thinks i need a guardian now
too its a wonder hed trust m so far
from home alone isnt it gave me a
thousand dollars and said it had to last
out of the smash-up



three months said that was every cent
hed allow me if i spent it in one
month id starve for the next two
maybe youd work cole suggested
maddern lifted his eyes thats his
game do you know he even gave me
the address of a friend of his out in san
pedro said the chap would give me a
position on the new breakwater think
of me holding down a real job

  id advise you to keep the address
the detective said youll have to eat
in california and luck plays us some
odd pranks

  thanks returned maddern dryly
lets talk of something pleasant
where are you bound 

  i dont know cole gazed reflec-
tively from the window

  you mean you wont tell

  i mean i dont know it all de-
pends

  maddern fixed his eyes on the table-
cloth a moment then said i get you
cole  youre dogging some one on this
train

  i wont deny it

  then its not me

  the detective shook his head

  but the governor sent you didnt
he

  yes the firm of maddern  miles
is rather interested in a certain bill clerk
of theirs who dropped out of sight six
months ago with some money belong-
ing to them

  oh i understand

  glad you do

hes on the train and youll nab him
when he leaves is that the program
patience was all that cole replied

chapter ii

difference of opinion

justin maddern son of john
j maddern head of the banking firm
of maddern  miles of denver had
been shipped to california by his father
three years at an eastern college had
drained the seniors patience and wor-
ried his pocketbook

  get out the elder maddern had ex-
ploded when justin bluntly admitted

being in several scrapes and also in
debt get out to california im dis-
gusted  get out there among strangers
and maybe youll get a little sense
knocked into your head ill start you
with a thousand dollars and itll have to
last you for three months he said
some other things which you heard jus-
tin tell the detective

  so the young man departed bag and
baggage at the station he met the girl
and played an important role in the lit-
tle scene enacted there-a case of mis-
checked baggage after that they were
friends many continuous hours alone
on the observation platform are con-
ducive to development as cole had
expressed it

  after the chat at the table the two
left the car and walked back to the rear
buffet and parlor coach here cole ex-
cused himself and stepped into the buf-
fet for a cigar justin continued on to
find neva curled up in a big chair en-
grossed in a magazine

  cant i bring you something to eat
he asked sitting beside her

  thank you but i had the porter get
me some tea and toast it was plenty
im not the least hungry im-nerv-
ous  im not used to traveling and
the thought of seeing my brother in a
few hours takes away my appetite
going to live in arizona justin
asked

  i-i guess so you see theres only
my brother and myself and were more
like pals than anything else weve been
that way ever since we were left or-
phans her eyes lighted up at the
mention of her brother oh dick is a
wonderful chap im wild with fear
that some girl will come along and
marry him

  justin laughed with her jove but
a mans lucky to have a sister like you
he observed in a low voice

  dicks working on a ranch likes
it too he was always fond of the out-
doors and horses im glad he got out
of the city

  they went out on the open platform
sank back in chairs and for a moment
gazed upon the vast expanse of sky and
desert


top-notch magazine

  to-morrow night ill be traveling
 alone he said presently til miss you
 a lot

  youve been considerate to me she
 returned i appreciate it

  may i write you he asked or
 would your brother object

  he wouldnt object-if he knew
 you

   justin fumbled for a card and pencil
 he wrote her name-miss neva doug-
 lass and the address 

   circle city arizona she told him
 in care of richard douglass

he dropped the card into his coat
pocket when do we arrive there
in about three hours i think
your brother will be at the station
to meet you i suppose 

  of course or he might show up at
 some town before that i wired him
 this morning

  at eleven oclock when most of the
 passengers had left the parlor end of the
 car for their berths justin suggested
 lemonade and went to the buffet to get
 it while the porter was mixing it
 cole sidled in and touched justins
 shoulder

  when does your friend leave us
 he asked

  you mean miss douglass oh it
 depends upon the time the train gets
 into--

  justin cut his remark short a sud-
 den gripping suspicion entered his
 mind

  depends upon the time the train
 gets where cole asked again

  justin closed his fingers great
 scott  he muttered

  no such town as that came from
 the detective

  cole  justin began the man you
 are after is named douglass 

  yes richard douglass

  when did he take the money from
 the firm 

  last christmas

  and the amount 

  nine hundred exactly

  they know he took it

  almost certain

   justin set his lips in a straight hard
 line pretty mean trick cole he

 said evenly youre following the
 sister-letting her lead you to the
 brother

  coles shoulders went up since
youve guessed it yes my profession
has its unpleasant duties but a thiefs a
thief and the law must--

  hang the law justin burst out
whats the use of digging into the
past you merely think that man took
the money and you are going to ruin
his whole life because of that belief
whats nine hundred dollars to my
father nine hundred dollars against a
mans name and a sisters heart this
douglass has been living a clean life-
why wont you let him continue 

  sorry i cant accommodate you
maddern cole observed quietly but

your fathers orders were--

  yes i suppose dad is worried about
the money he always did do that
hed spend a hundred to get fifty back
but just forget what he said and listen
to reason this girls a brick and shes
wrapped up in her brother im sure
she doesnt know about this affair hes
charged with if she did it would kill
her thats all hang it all man havent
you any heart

  hearts are not trumps in my busi-
ness the detective responded now
look here he said seriously when
that money was missed from douglass
department he quietly dropped from
view we couldnt get the least trace
of him isnt that pretty strong evi-
dence finally i got wind of a sister
-that girl youve been sitting out on
the platform with-so i kept a watch on
her i knew she was in touch with him
when she left town the other day i was
positive she would meet him so i
tagged along possibly she doesnt
know the truth-and i do feel sorry for
her but you cant mix sentiment with
law when she greets her brother ill
be right on the job with a warrant
well at least you dont know where
shes to get off this train snapped jus-
tin and ill take pains to see that you
dont learn

  really  the detective shook his
head in a pitying manner im afraid
youre about five minutes too late i
out of the smash-up



lifted a card front your pocket-you
had her name and address on it oh i
wouldnt flare up your lemonade is
waiting

chapter iii

not scheduled

ith a pounding heart justin took
the two glasses the porter held
out and made his way very carefully
back to the rear platform still he
spilled some of the lemonade his mind
was working in a strange manner the
last five minutes conversation with cole
had brought a sudden realization home
to him how peculiarly the once-forgot-
ten affair had returned how was it
to work out for the first and only
time in his life justin felt burdened with
a vital responsibility

  as he stepped out of the rear door
and called to the girl the lights went out
like a snuffed candle a sickening rush
of air tore at his lungs in the inky
darkness the hooded roof sank down
he pitched forward blindly holding to
the two glasses and realizing foolishly
that he was spilling the contents

  steel shrieked on steel the splinter-
ing of wood crashed to his ears he
shouted but was unable to hear his own
voice he felt in that flash of time
without in the least losing conscious-
ness as if a mighty whirlwind had
picked him up twisted him about top-
fashion and finally hurled him brutally
to the ground

  a vague measureless interval fol-
lowed he found himself doubled up
not uncomfortably under the hood of
the observation car cautiously he
tested each muscle prodded himself
expectantly nothing appeared to be
wrong

  great guns he murmured rever-
ently a smash-up and im as fit as a
fiddle what do you know about that
for luck

  then he remembered and his heart
skipped a beat or two where was
neva she had been at least within
five feet of him the moment the lights
went out with a groan he groped
about in the limited space twisted
a

steel bits of jagged wood rods glass
and parts of chairs-everything it
seemed sprang up under his touch ex-
cept what he dreaded to feel the girl
was not there either she had been
thrown away from the wreck or-

  he shuddered wiped at his moist
forehead and found a match this he
struck shielding it with a palm then
he peered fearfully gphout nothing
other than what his fingers had dis-
closed met his gaze

  the match went out burnirfg down to
his fingers he lay for a long time gaz-
ing straight into the gloom that envel-
oped him at times he heard the dis-
tant murmur of voices the chopping of
what might have been axes once he
heard an explosion that jarred the
ground the timbers creaked and set-
tled about him in the silence that
followed he lifted his voice and called
he received no answer

  a tiny point of light first aroused his
curiosity as it grew larger he sat erect
rubbing at his eyes when understand-
ing finally regained its sway he was
conscious of a peculiar tremor passing
up and down his spine his body sud-
denly became moist his pulses fairly
jumped into a race

  with a quick intake of breath he
gripped at the nearest steel rod and
pulled at it it yielded not the slightest
part of an inch then he gained his
knees and with both hands worked at
the tangled wreckage that held him
trapped

  he cried aloud desperately as the
light became brighter it flared so high
now that his surroundings were bathed
in a dull reddish pulsating glow oc-
casionally a heated wave fanned his wet
face like the breath from some infuri-
ated animal

  the wreckage wras burning

  a puff of smoke biting like acid to
his eyes and lungs alike served as a
spur he attacked the immovable tim-
bers with a fury iittle short of madness
his fingers became bleeding stumps-
yet somehow such was his fear he felt
no pain from them the sweat poured
into his eyes the smoke increased
his trap was becoming unbearable

  he sank wearily exhausted against
the side this then was the end the
fire was gaining inch by inch soon
very soon it would reach his body

  staring death in the face justins
mind went back to what had passed only
a short time ago the situation gripped
his brain sweeping for the moment all
before it

  subconsciously he fumbled and
found his cardcase with a stub of a
pencil and by the aid of the glowing
flames he hurriedly wrote across the
back signing his own name after a
seconds indecision he took out his cigar
case slipped the card into it and then
with all his remaining strength he
hurled it through a small opening in the
roof above his head he saw it disap-
pear

  the smoke thickened like a pall he
coughed then he lifted his voice for
the last time his reason left him like
the breaking of a string

chapter iv

professional honor

lje drifted back to the world again
with the cold night air on his face
and the white stars twinkling high above
him for the moment he could not rec-
ollect what had happened then with
half a frown and an impatient move of
his arms he remembered

   as justin sat erect feeling stiff but
otherwise unhurt he saw the line of
wreckage belowt him some of it still
smoldering toward the east the sky
was reddening dim forms moved
back and forth to the left he saw the
glimmer of sickly yellow lights and the
outlines of buildings-a station building
a water tank and the tall lifted arm of
a semaphore it pounded to his wan-
dering brain that this was a tiny sta-
tion in the heart of the desert and that
the wrreck had taken place just outside
the yard limits

  justin got up and lurched along the
embankment the yellow light beck-
oned at the door of a low shed he
paused and looked in it had been hur-
riedly fitted up as a hospital several

women passengers evidently flitted
back and forth among the makeshifts of
beds a few lanterns offered the only
light as he swayed there almost
drunkenly-for his brain was still
dazed and his limbs weak-some one
called his name and he turned to look
into the eager face of neva douglass

  oh mr maddern she cried you
-and unhurt

  he wagged his head slowly not the
least hurt just a trifle dizzy thats
all

  he clung to her arm conscious and
happy for the slender support she
made i never expected to see you-
here he said again

  i was flung clear of the car and
landed in the soft sand i didnt even
lose my senses ive been helping the
others who were not so fortunate
brave girl justin said and pressed
her arm

  theres a friend of yours-on the
end cot she went on hes been ask-
ing about you-over and over

  the detective cole justin had for-
gotten him until this moment

  badly hurt he asked thickly

not seriously-but his legs are
bruised the doctor has just left him
justin swallowed hard cole injured
could it possibly mean that the detective

was unable to follow-

  ill go to him he said

  in the faint light of the lantern he
sank down beside the last cot the girl
tiptoed away in answer to a cry cole
opening his eyes uttered a sharp ex-
clamation 

  hello maddern  get out of that
hell did you hurt

  not at all

  good i wasnt so lucky got my
legs bunged up some doctor said id
have to stay in bed for a month can
you beat that

  im sorry justin replied but his
heart beat just a trifle faster

  well it cant be helped cole went
on as if resigned might have been
worse i got bunged up-but i got
douglass

  justin jerked himself erect so vio-
lently as to jar the cot he stared dully
out of the smash-up



upon the sufferer for a moment before
his lips could frame the two words
got him

  yes and in a funny way part of
that buffet car fell across my legs
there i lay like a trussed chicken
watching the fire creep toward me i
was about to give up when a big chap
came along sang out cheerfully and
chopped me free with an ax when he
was lifting me out i happened to get a
good look at his face and under the
smut and grease and dirt i saw-rich-
ard douglass guess we both got wise
to each other at the same time he sort
of trembled i said hello douglass 
just been looking for you coming
back without any fuss and he an-
swered yes ill come with you only
let me work here until daylight theres
so much to do there are dozens under
these cars yet just let me work until
daylight wont you 

  so i let him work cole resumed
after a pause what else could i do
-after the chap begging me with tears
in his eyes  hes to come here at dawn
and surrender

  and his sister justin asked does
she know

  hardly think so theyve been
working side by side for hours i guess
douglass has brought in at least a dozen
men since ive been here hes been a
fiend for work and the girl-well
im not much on sentiment and i al-
ways scoff at it but jingo shes got the
softest hands and the most healing
touch heaven ever gave to woman
and-and youre going to arrest
douglass-when he comes here  mad-
dern exclaimed hoarsely

  cole nodded at dawn

  hell never come justin asserted
he gave me his word-and i took
it the detective said quietly

  justin sank back against the wall but
continued to stare straight into the de-
tectives white face a man pulls you
from certain death-and instead of
thanking him you arrest him ive been

rotten in my time-but-

  its the profession maddern cole
interrupted dont forget that

chapter v

a prisoner taken

hthe dawn broke as swiftly as a stage
sunrise the flat arid floor of the
desert melted into pink and gold and
the skies trembled with their multifari-
ous colors

  i told you he wouldnt come jus-
tin said after the long interval of si-
lence any man would be a fool de-
liberately to surrender-give up his lib-
erty-especially when he knows you
cant get him again

  cole only looked out of the low door
and said hes coming now

  the man came in he seemed fairly
to fill the doorway and the very room
he was wide-shouldered bronzed by the
desert sun coatless and hatless he
stood for the moment gazing back to-
ward the wreck now plainly visible in
the dawn his big hands clenched them-
selves he turned and saw the detec-
tive

  im here cole his voice was
calm and even i said sunrise didnt
i im a minute or two late there
was so much to do-out there

  the detective struggled erect in his
cot and austin slipped a pillow behind
him douglass shake hands with mr
maddern

  justin gripped the mans hand im
happy to meet you mr douglass
douglass allowed his eyes to rest
upon the others face for the moment
i recollect chopping you out of that ob-
servation end he said pretty nar-
row for you it was too

  something choked in justins throat
he tried to speak but before his lips
could form the right words cole inter-
rupted 

  i guess there are plenty of us who
owe our lives to you douglass the
detective bit his lip then resumed his
voice once more under control i
guess theres no use discussing a painful
subject any longer we three at least
know the exact situation last christ-
mas a package of currency amounting
to nine hundred dollars was missed
from your department douglass evi-
dently you were aware of it before the

others because you suddenly dropped
from sight

  douglass bowed his head ive been
cowardly i couldnt help myself i
didnt steal the money but i knew all
the evidence would be against me and-
and i did so want my freedom so i
came here

  john maddern put the case into my
hands we located your sister when
she left denver i followed confident
she was to meet you

  justin broke into a cry wait-
cole he stammered i want-to say

-that-

  when ive finished you can talk
cole interrupted meanwhile it be-
comes m painful duty to get these
bracelets on the guilty man

  cole reached for his coat at the head
of the cot and brought out a pair of
handcuffs douglass paled but he ex-
tended his hands that the detective
might easily adjust the steel loops jus-
tin in turn started forward his hands
too were outstretched as if to plead for
the other

  cole with a deft move reached out
and snapped the handcuffs about the
nearest wrists-those of justin mad-
dern 

chapter vi

ix the cigar case

ljalf an hour later when cole and

	 justin were alone together doug-
lass having left for the ranch with his
sister maddern turned to the detective

  when did you first suspect me he
asked

  i had my suspicions all along but
i wasnt positive until i found that con-
fession of yours in the cigar case
douglass picked it up and handed it to
me thinking i had dropped it

  justin stared across the hot desert
the emergency train had arrived an
hour ago and they were carrying the in-
jured into the special cars his hand-
cuffs had been removed

  ive learned a wonderful lesson to-
night he said after a while i think
ive been tried by fire-and come out a
man that day i took the package of
notes i was desperate-needed the cash
to square same pressing debts i knew
my father wouldnt give it to me i had
no idea of any one being accused of the
theft-although i might have known
had i not been such a fool and then
to-night when i saw those flames eat-
ing toward me and realized that if i
were to die and douglass still be ac-
cused- he broke off with a sob

  i think it best that your father learn
nothing of this-he might not under
stand-the way i do cole said quietly
i shall merely say that douglass re-
turned the money and-

  justin looked into the detectives face
the understanding dawned clear and
he smiled

  i think it would be the best way
he answered he slipped a hand to his
inner pocket and drew out an envelope
from it he passed over to cole nine
one-hundred-dollar bills but one bill
remained of the sum his father had
given him

  sometimes cole said smiling
sometimes my profession isnt so bad
still it isnt a game of hearts he hesi-
tated a moment before resuming i-i
suppose youll be returning with me-
back to denver 

  maddern shook his head my ticket
is still good-and it reads through to
san pedro and i still have that card
the governor gave me i think im
going to have a jolly time working on
that new breakwater

a reckless investment

tiger-skin rug at ten dol-
lars and ten cents would seem
to be a bargain then again
it might prove a complete
waste of currency it all de-
pends whether you want a tiger-skin
rug also on the condition of the article
this particular rug hkd been offered at
a customhouse sale and knocked down
with peculiar swiftness to mr schussler
for the sum of ten dollars and ten cents

  mr schussler whose fur store in the
middle of a block on a cross-town street
you may have noticed had gone to the
sale intending to purchase fox skins
but either he couldnt get his bids in at
the right moment or he hesitated at an
advance many more important oppor-
tunities than fox skins have been missed
in the same way but schussler did not
see it exactly in that light he thought
there was favoritism on the rostrum
and openly said as much mr auction-
eer firmly refuted any such pact advised
mr schussler to speak up louder and
promised him ample redress for a purely
imaginary grievance

  he delivered it presently when he
offered the tiger-skin rug at ten dollars

in a spirit of nettled irony schussler
bid ten cents advance the auctioneers
pencil fell with a smart rap on his book
as he remarked that the tiger-skin rug
had passed to the ownership of mr
schussler

  i hope said mr auctioneer smil-
ing pleasantly that the gentleman is
now satisfied there is no favoritism here
i accepted his bid right away

  for a moment schussler looked non-
plused while one or two of his - ac-
quaintances in the fur trade chuckled

  well you got the tiger rug all right
said a little man who had been a spir-
ited and successful bidder for the fox
skins nobody wanted to raise your
ten cents on that tiger rug if you was
sleeping schussler i guess mr action-
eer was awake what you going to do
mit that old tiger rug  i think you bet-
ter cut it up for a winter overcoat
make a new style for the attomobile
schussler had already perceived his
error and pulling himself together re-
fused td admit either lack of judgment
in his purchase or that he had not a
definite purpose when the ten-cent bid
slipped rashly out of his mouth

  still when he came to examine the
rug he found little joy in his acquisi-
tion it proved to be rusty in shade

worn in patches and looked as it if had
been kicked around the appraisers store
for months possibly years

  he certainly did not want the rug
and could not foresee what he was going
to do with it unless it might be used for
repairing other tiger rugs but that
kind of work came in seldom and
meanwhile he was out ten dollars and
ten cents plus twenty-five cents ex-
pressage

  and that was not all there was
mrs schussler mrs schussler was
both his domestic and business partner
-a capable woman who took charge of
the shop in his absence she had ap-
proved the prospective purchase of the
fox skins but to bring home an old
tiger-skin rug was another matter for
which he might anticipate more or less
severe criticism

  he felt it would be difficult to explain
just how he came by the thing and for
the life of him couldnt find a purpose
for it which would satisfy mrs schus-
slers probable questions at least not
until he was riding uptown in a street
car and his eye chanced to fall on a
lion in mortal combat with a python
mounted above the door of a fashion-
able fur store quite a satisfied smile
overspread his face which some people
would call a beam of inspiration what
his idea was he hastened to put before
mrs schussler the moment he crossed
the threshold of his fur shop

  well we dont get the fox skins he
began they was all moth-eaten and
no good but i bought a tiger rug-
very cheap-for ten dollars and ten
cents

  mrs schussler looked up sharply
from marking some dyed rabbit-skin
muffs at prices suitable to near-mink

  a tiger rug she exclaimed what
you want to go and buv a tiger rug for 
why-

  schussler interposed with an apolo-
getic cough and gesture

  just wait while i tell you why i
bought the tiger rug-at only ten dollars
and ten cents-which was a wonderful
bargain for a tiger rug at the sale i
was talking with mr blumenburg of
the international fur company every

year he go to london and paris two or
three times to buy furs that fellow
blumenburg thinks nothing of writing
a check for a hundred thousand dol-
lars

  yes but what has that got to do
with your buying the tiger rug mrs
schussler questioned to the point

  we come to it this way schussler
invented as plausible a story as possible
as he went on blumenburg said to
me schussler you have a nice location
and a good trade but how long you go-
ing to keep that old show bear above
your shop front by jiminy pretty
soon that old show bear shake loose and
if he fall down and hit a policeman then
you get into trouble you surely do
need a new show bear schussler and
it seem to me he was right

  well ejaculated mrs schussler

  well dont you see we take the old
show bear down and fix the tiger skin
on his frame we have then a fine
show tiger as i came up on the car i
see now they have a hon fighting with
a big snake over a fur store every-
thing grow bigger all the time used to
be a small animal was enough pretty
soon i guess we have show elephants
now we take a jump from the old bear
to a tiger that is why i buy the tiger-
skin rug and we have a new sign for
ten dollars and ten cents

a poor mascot

al rs schussler was not entirely
convinced though there appeared
to be business logic in her husbands ar-
gument she was a practical woman
but for all that she hesitated to part
with the old show bear which for sev-
eral years had presided over their des-
tiny upward from a small beginning

  in a sense she believed it had brought
them luck and was doubtful about the
benign influence of a tiger still she
was forced to admit the rains of sum-
mer and storms of winter had left the
show bear presenting a woefully dis-
reputable appearance

  its ghastly jaws lent to the face a
for the tigers eye



grotesquely hideous expression while
the torn rent and tattered skin dis-
closed in places the framework beneath
it was clearly long past patching up and
no longer worth the trouble of covering
with a mackintosh in wet weather as
had been mrs schusslers concern in
times past

  for these reasons she yielded a some-
what reluctant consent particularly
when the tiger-skin rug arrived to
prove in no wise available for indoor
ornamental purposes

  on their close expert inspection how-
ever certain peculiarities were observed

  at one time the skin had undoubtedly
been of the first grade its mounting
was of foreign workmanship and the
head retained the animals original
whiskers which was unusual owing to
the natives desire to possess such ob-
jects for charms

 moreover when the eyes were
cleaned of stains and dust the crudity of
oriental work was clearly in evidence
no attempt had been made to reproduce
with any fidelity the natural eye of the
tiger but instead two green transpar-
ent balls had been inserted in the sockets
of the skull giving to the beasts face a
peculiarly sinister expression

  ill tell you said schussler turn-
ing the rug over thoughtfully with his
foot what we do do when we get the
tiger skin on the old bears frame we
have an electric wire run up into the
head and two lights behind the eyes
then when he look down at night fierce
i guess he make people stop how
about that mrs schussler

  mrs schussler agreed that since the
change in their show animal was to be
made it was best to render the tiger as
noticeable as possible

  after a while added schussler re-
flectively as improvements occurred to
him we can have one of the tigers
paws on a stuff goat that will be more
in style but for the present i think the
lights in his eyes will make a big effect
out of the dark he will look as if he is
going to jump right down into the street
that should be good advertising worth
many times ten dollars and ten cents

  the process of transferring the tiger
skin to the frame of the old show bear
proved more arduous than schussler an-
ticipated because bears and tigers are
built on somewhat different lines and
parts of the bear frame had to be altered
to suit the convenience of the tiger

  but fortunately the show bears pose
-on four legs with head turned ob-
servingly streetward-was easier of
adaptation than if to use a heraldic
phrase it had been a savage beast ram-
pant thus when the tiger was com-
plete with eyes electrically aflame after
dark-blazing down in savage green fe-
rocity upon the passing wayfarer-the
schusslers were gratified by general
recognition of their labor

  that fellow schussler is putting on
style with his tiger remarked the pic-
ture-frame maker opposite to his neigh-
bor a bird and fancy animal dealer
business in the fur trade must be look-
ing up

  um grunted the fancy animal
dealer the darned thing is scaring
all my goods to death-set the dogs
cats and monkeys in the window to
kicking up a pretty racket its the eyes
i guess that worry them

  now things go well or bad according
to a variety of circumstances in which
such inanimate objects as show bears or
tigers can have no influence but when
a very mild winter followed the change
from the old show bear to the compara-
tively new tiger and consequently the
demand for furs fell to a low ebb mrs
schusslers fears began to perceive a
connection

  it was almost confirmed when a furi-
ous gale taxed insecure props and get-
ting a grip on the tiger twisted it around
so that it hung perilously over the street
schussler called in competent workmen
who firmly secured the tiger with iron
rods and clamps but airs schussler
saw in the incident an unfavorable
omen she imagined the tiger was go-
ing to prove a hoodoo just as she had
regarded the old bear as a mascot

  it was rather a case of i told you
so and schussler was again inclined to
regret that intemperate bid of ten cents
advance

three eyes

two men of bronze complexion who
 wore their long hair twisted in a
knot under the back rim of their hats
dropped in one day to ask if it would
be possible to rent the floor above
schusslers shop the one who acted as
spokesman gave his name as sadath
pestinji and remarked that the other
was his brother they wished to open
an oriental salesroom on the floor
above

  this-place said sadath running all
his words together in a curious meas-
ured way this-place-would-suit-our-
purpose-very-well yas very-well we-
see-that-it-is-now-to-be-sure - occupied
but-sometimes-a-change-can-become-ar-
ranged yas become-arranged

  schussler replied that he couldnt an-
swer for the present tenant-a photog-
rapher-but there would be no harm
done by approaching him or the agent
on the subject

  the two men thanked schussler pro-
fusely and went out of the shop in a
kind of amble being unaccustomed to
wearing heavy shoes

  for some days they did not reappear
but schussler heard from the photog-
rapher that he had accepted a good of-
fer to vacate the premises presently
the photographer moved out and pes-
tinji  co occupied the floor with some
cooking pots and a few cheap sticks of
furniture

  they gave out that a large consign-
ment of goods was on the way and
drew down the shades to be secure from
observation apparently they seldom
went out except to purchase provisions
but when they did so mrs schussler
whose curiosity in the foreign strangers
had been roused noticed that if they
chanced to pass the front of the shop
they bowed after their own fashion by
raising the finger tips of both hands to
their foreheads this she took to be
an act of courtesy toward herself and
nodded pleasantly in return

  mr sadathwas in asking about the
show tiger she remarked on one occa-
sion he wanted to know where you

got it and why you fixed it up over the
shop front he didnt seem to under-
stand

  he didnt i repeated schussler
well i dont see why he wants to find
out anything about it i dont care for
those fellows looks anyway-kind of
slippery snakelike people they have
no goods up there and i dont under-
stand their business one thing is
pretty certain-they dont intend to buy
furs i guess we have no particular
reason for encouraging them to come
around

  it may be pestinji  co compre-
hended schusslers attitude toward
them in any case neither member of the
firm again attempted to cross his thresh-
old when passing they usually main-
tained a downcast thoughtful mien as
if entirely concerned in their own af-
fairs

  presently the schusslers lost interest
in their movements and hardly gave
them cursory notice in this way a cer-
tain night fell which brought with it
surprising developments

  schussler had closed up at a late hour
and joined mrs schussler in their flat
a couple of blocks away for supper
it occurred to him that he had not
switched off the lights in the tigers eyes
or rather mrs schussler reminded him
of one or two former omissions in that
respect

  he was not quite sure but he thought
he might just as well return and make
certain because to keep the lights going
all night when business was slack was
a useless waste of electricity

  therefore telling mrs schussler that
he would be back in ten minutes he
picked up his hat and went forth briskly
a short walk brought him in view of the
store and he saw in the comparative
darkness of the side street that the ti-
gers eyes were out the peculiar glare
of those green balls could be seen easily
from that distance therefore he reck-
oned he must have switched off the cur-
rent

  and yet somehow he didnt recol-
lect having done so he paused a trifle
uncertain whether to take another look
at the store or return to the flat
for the tigers eye



  a little splutter of blue flame at the
base of one of the tigers paws drew his
attention possibly something had gone
wrong with the insulation the tiger
might be in danger of cremation so he
decided to investigate

  approaching his shop he glanced up
to mark a moving object-or what
seemed to be such-in the deep shadow
between the tiger and the side wall of
the building

  above one of the windows of pes-
tinji  co was partly raised and a face
could be seen peering out with caution

  an arm reached downward from the
window in the act of passing something
a moment later another hand stole
around the tigers head the fingers
working nimbly over its features

  this much schussler made out in the
slanting gleam of a street lamp

  he jumped back into the road and
shouted the hand was swiftly with-
drawn into the shadow behind the tiger
and the window above was closed
stealthily

  schussler shouted again but receiv-
ing no response hardly knew what to
make of it certainly there was some-
thing wrong the first idea in schuss-
ler s mind being an attempt to steal his
show tiger if so it was an outrage he
did not feel like enduring passively

  it was possible to step from the hall
window of the second story onto the
ledge above schusslers shop he had
availed himself of that route to adjust
the tigers mackintosh in wet weather
and he took it now with speed three
steps at a bound

  he gained the hall window threw it
open and climbed on to the sill reach-
ing down with one leg for the ledge

  instantly his foot was grasped by two
hands and he was jerked violently out-
ward his intended destination evidently
being a bone-fracturing crash on the
pavement beneath

  but in the wrench he had swerved
sideways and throwing out his arms
wildly managed to grasp the hind quar-
ters of the tiger

  the next moment he found himself
jammed in the narrow space betwreen

the tiger and the wall at death grips
with a muscular adversary

  he had cast one arm around the oth-
ers neck and he recognized in the face
thus drawn close to his own the mali-
ciously contorted features of sadath
pestinji

  meanwhile sadath had locked his
arms around schussle-s chest and py-
thon-fashion was endeavoring to
squeeze the breath out of him also
the window above had again been
opened and an arm came forth this
time making thrusts with a supple blade
to reach a vital spot in schussler pro-
tected somewhat by his antagonists
body

  in his cramped position schussler
could neither twist turn nor use his dis-
engaged arm to any advantage neither
could he shout for assistance for the
coiled arms had so tightened that only a
gasp came from his throat while his
ribs seemed to be on the point of crack-
ing-

  the curious struggle went on in si-
lence except for the desperate efforts to
gain breath it seemed likely to end dis-
astrously for schussler unless moved to
decisive action for sadaths brother or
partner was preparing to climb down
from the window and use his weapon
to a certain stroke

  schussler realized this and pulled
himself together for a final struggle
he sank down suddenly and being
much the heavier of the two managed
to carry sadath with him twisting him
into such a position that he fell under-
neath

  the securely clamped forepaws of
the tiger held firm and saved both from
rolling down into the street this was
schusslers chance and he took it
gaining a purchase with his knee he
sank both hands into sadaths throat
and heaved with all his might

  the arms around schusslers body
were unwound in an effort to dislodge
the throat grip and schussler was there-
by enabled to put forth shouts of in-
creasing plume for help

  shortly a group of inquisitive and
gesticulating figures collected beneath

wondering at the fight going on behind
the show tiger a policeman appeared
on the scene and schussler directed him
to a settlement of things by way of the
landing window thus when sadath
had been dragged from the ledge and
the blade thruster night-sticked into
submission the policeman looked to
schussler for an explanation

  they were trying to steal my show
tiger was the irate and panting charge
he made i guessed as much when my
wife told me they wanted to find out
where i got it

  the policeman looked a bit puzzled
stealing a show tiger was a unique of-
fense in his experience it seemed to
need further investigation that re-
sulted in the discovery that the electric
wires for the eye lights had been neatly
severed and that one of the tigers eyes
was missing

  a personal search revealed the tigers
eye in the possession of one of the pris-
oners at least apparently so until
another one was found on the ledge just
beneath the tigers head where it had
evidently fallen in the struggle

  thus when the policeman took the
prisoners to the station he carried as
exhibits of the crime one rubber glove
a pair of shears and two tigers eyes

chapter iv

in large figures

at the station schussler identified his
tigers eye in the one found on the
prisoner by a slight scratch on the sur-
face which he had carelessly made with
a tool when adjusting the head as to
the other eye he knew nothing except
that it was apparently intended for a
substitute

  as the prisoners refused to explain
their action the first proof to bear out
this theory was the discovery of a mys-
tical inscription engraved on the reverse
surface of the eye backed by a trans-
parent pigment to give it the appear-
ance of being carved in the center

  then followed the surprising -expert
decision that the eye was not of ordi-
nary glass as the schusslers and every

one else supposed but an emerald of
great price

  very quickly schussler plucked out
the tigers other eye but that proved an
imitation closely resembling the one on
the ledge

  naturally the question followed as to
whether both the tigers eyes had been
precious stones and the prisoners had
been successful with one of them in a
former attempt  it was never definitely
answered

 they would not say anything
neither threats nor persuasion could ex-
tract a word they refused to defend
their action and were convicted of at-
tempted burglary and assault

  after a term of years in the peniten-
tiary where they maintained good con-
duct they were released and never
heard of again

  detective sergeant hogari who was
assigned to the case trailed it back-
ward as far as he could there were
merely the customhouse records in
which it was stated that the tiger-skin
rug had been seized on a sailor attempt-
ing to smuggle and for all that was now
known of the sailor he might have gone
to davy jones locker

  but by referring the matter to pro-
fessor holfman the orientalist a little
light was turned on the mystery pro-
fessor hoffman deciphered the inscrip-
tion carved in the stone as the name of
an idol of special sanctity and conse-
quently entitled to a blaze of jewels in
one of the great hindu temples near
madras

  he gave it as his opinion that the rug
had been used as a seat for the idol
that it was stolen by the sailor and its
wake had been subsequently taken up
and followed to the united states

  as to its bearing on the fortune of
the schusslers you have only to step
into a first-class jewelers and ask for
an emerald of several carats weight
and deep grass-green velvet shade sim-
ilar to that of the tigers eye if the
jeweler has one of that size and quality
his chief trouble will be to fix the price
high enough-away beyond diamonds
and all other precious stones

  consequently when schussler got a
for the tigers eye



bid of five thousand dollars if it mo-
mentarily took his breath away it very
quickly made him wary he smiled and
shook his head

  but i dont come here for a joke he 
said this stone is the same as rus-
sian sable and when we bid for russian
sable-well-we talk business

  but mr schussler the merchant
jeweler began to protest

  ah right nodded schussler indif-
ferently holding out his hand for the
emerald ill take it back

  but the jeweler retained the stone
gazing down into its marvelous depths
almost lovingly

  well what price do you set upon
it he questioned

  schussler leaned over a polished
table in the merchants office fixed his
eyes penetratingly on the others face
and said slowly

  fifty thousand dollars

  what schussler keenly noted was that
while the jeweler affected astonishment
he did not treat the price named with
contempt

  there followed much dickering con-
sultations between the partners of the
firm and several trips back and forth
by schussler meanwhile he led mrs
schussler to believe that after all the
stone was not worth much finally the

jeweler climbed to an offer of forty
thousand dollars

  and two thousand for mrs schuss-
ler added schussler just as you
have your partners so there is with
me mrs schussler as it is mrs
schussler says-

  the jeweler interposed with a ges-
ture as if he had heard it all before
and was weary of further argument
he simply wrote a check for forty-two
thousand dollars and handed it over to
schussler

  thereupon schussler went home in a
taxi grinning and waving his hand hi-
lariously from the window to wonder-
ing acquaintances his arrival in such
fashion at first alarmed mrs schussler

  have you gone crazy with that old
tigers eye she questioned

  schussler did not reply but placing
an arm around her waist drew her into
the shop then he produced the check
holding it before her astounded gaze

  look he exclaimed for ten
dollars and ten cents we now get forty-
two thousand that old tiger rug was
pretty good business hey  well i
think we put your brother in charge of
the shop and make a trip to paris mr
blumenburg of the international fur
company who scatters money around
everywhere-we go with him on the
same ship

when the men cats met

a bunch of lawyers were sleeping in a stuffy courtroom in a country town
because of the overcrowded condition of the single hotel during a session
of court said a lawyer when one of them a practical joker possessing a re-
markable faculty of imitating a cat concluded to have fun out of it after all
of them had quieted down to sleep he started a plaintive moan like a cat an-
other fellow on the opposite side of the room had a similar faculty of imita-
tion and was awakened by the noise of the supposed cat and remarked to his
next fellow

     some darned cat got into the room just wait ill imitate a tabby and
well catch the tom

    so the two began meowing at each other the first supposed it was a real
cat and the room being extremely dark they kept approaching each other each
with a boot in hand to demolish the supposed cat they got together finally
and then there was an act not down on the program each had aimed his boot
well and when a light was finally struck the two men were mixing it up badly
in the center of the room and it took the rest of the lawyers and the town doctor
to get them in presentable shape for court the following day
a serial novel

condensed for those who have not

  captain roger kemp just returned from
england during the dark days of the revolu-
tion to seek his share of the estate of his
late uncle michael lawe meets major john
favor of the british army on one of the
new jersey roads on a dark stormy night
together they take refuge in the old lawe
mansion itself and roger kemp then learns
that major favor is also a nephew of michael
lawe and is there to claim the entire estate
for himself

  they quarrel and favor accuses kemp of
being a rebel and sends to the town for the
british dragoons while quarreling favor
asks kemp what possible hope the ragamuffin
rebels have and as if in answer a mysterious
hand appears from the hangings on a bal-
cony arid traces in letters of fire upon the
wall the name of george washington

  the dragoons arrive to seize kemp but he
fights major favor wounds him and escapes
from the house with the aid of the old
servant barnaby lamson a mysterious
light-like a will o the wisp-guides him
across the dangerous swamp and he is hid-
den in a barn by the half-witted son of a
rebel farmer

  on the following morning he obtains a
horse and starts for newark to join the rebel
army but decides to pay a call at the house
of old squire perrine whose daughter sylvia
he more than half suspects of being his mys-
terious guide across the swamp

  chapter vii

a morning call

he fog had disappeared and
the falling temperature im-
proved the road which had
been a mire the night be-
fore the ring of the horses
hoofs upon the rapidly freezing ground
announced his coming before he entered
the gateway of the perrine estate and
when halfway up the avenue the young
man sighted the squire himself on his
veranda peering under his hand to iden-
tify the approaching caller

  the sun was just rising and its level
rays interfered with the old gentlemans
view even when kemp set his horse at
a brisk canter and waved his hand in
greeting it was plain that the squire did
not know him

  not until he drew rein before the
steps and turned squarely to look at his
old acquaintance with his customary
smile did perrines frosty countenance
melt into a cordial expression

  i declare if it aint roger kemp
exclaimed the master of the house
and i thought ye well off in england
come in come in youre in time
for breakfast heard the old man was
dead i spose so ye come with the rest
of the crows to see if there were any
pickings for you on his bones  he he
youre all sold i understand this ere
english officer john favor is come to
will o the wisp



seize the estate by law-if he kin find
law enough in this colony to establish
his rights come in come in glad
to see ye roger

  by this queer mixture of cordiality
and depravity old perrine clearly
showed his nature he was as hospit-
able as any old country squire priding
himself on keeping open house after
the english custom but his guests usu-
ally paid for their entertainment by en-
during the unkind chatter of their host

  kemp however long since used to
perrines carping tongue only smiled
over this welcome and leaping off his
horse shook the old man warmly by the
hand

  i have come on a small errand and
am in haste mr perrine he said as
for breakfast-well i have already
eaten but i will keep you company at
table for old-times sake you look
hearty squire

  an so i be declared the old man
though im two year older than was
michael ye see i outlast him-i outlast
him  come in come in  ill send the
maid to hurry sylvia down you and
she were always quarreling roger had
ye been friendlier like enough old mich-
aels property would now be yours he
wanted you an my sylvia to mate-
that bee wras ever buzzing in his bon-
net

  i am afraid master perrine your
little girl would scarcely have agreed to
the arrangement kemp said striding
into the house behind his host if i
remember rightly the last time i saw
sylvia she boxed my ears and called me
a bumptious calf-or such like pleasing
name i presume she is quite grown up
now 

  grown up gad shes a woman
and bosses us all shes even got her
old dad by the nose declared perrine
but that did not so much impress kemp
for he knew that little mistress sylvia
had held sway over the household and
every soul in it from her cradle

  they entered the long morning room
where a solemn black man stood behind
the squires chair at the head of the
table-a servant in rich livery a pow-
dered wig twice the size of the squires

own and with silk stockings and silver-
buckled shoes although the old gen-
tleman was dressed not only plainly but
carelessly himself his household had
little about it that was simple or demo-
cratic

  kemp found no opportunity of stating
his particular reason for visiting his
old acquaintance for the squire ran on
about this and that interspersing his in-
vitations to his guest to partake of the
viands which the servants brought on
with sharp comments upon persons with
whom kemp had been acquainted be-
fore he left the country

  and i suppose you have come back
to join in this play-war that has cursed
us for months past-though in truth
tis about over now  the old gentleman
suggested our loyal young men are
winning smiles from the women and
easy glory in fighting these miserable
ruffians who have overturned the peace
of the colonies and who would throw
aside their allegiance to his majesty-
heaven preserve him i understand
that my lord cornwallis is close on the
heels of that scoundrel washington and
his army of malcontents do you join
him roger

  thus brought to a plain avowal of his
intentions and knowing the irascibility
of the old gentleman kemp hesitated
but before perrine could repeat the
query or be made suspicious by the
young mans hesitancy the door of the
room opened and there swept in a per-
son whose appearance quite precluded
the possibility of kemps replying to the
squires speech

  in the past sylvia perrine had sel-
dom appeared before kemp except in
the guise of a harum-scarum girl who
tore her frocks played with the boys
and was warranted to prick the bubble
of his dignity she mimicked him and
made him ridiculous affronting him in
innumerable ways until kemp declared
her to be quite the most objectionable
child he knew

  but this dignified-even haughty-
young lady took away his breath she
would always be a doll-like creature
but she did not need height to give her
dignity of bearing kemp was fairly

overwhelmed and found himself stam-
mering and blushing over the hand she
gave him when he rose from the table to
greet her

  hi hi cackled old perrine i
told ye shed grown out of all remem-
brance roger dont look much like
the young un ye useter see flyin about
here on pony back eh

  father admonished mistress syl-
via and it was actually kemp who
showed confusion because of the
squires propensity to recall old times
instead of the girl herself she wel-
comed him with a polite aloofness which
did not add to kemps self-possession

  nor didrhis frank amazement and ad-
miration melt her heart she knew he
was comparing her present womanhood
with her former self and that alone was
sufficient to afford her a wicked delight
in making roger kemp as uncomfort-
able as possible he could scarce be-
lieve that the little hoyden who once
caused him such annoyance had bloomed
into this exquisite and beautiful crea-
ture

  her blond hair was still riotous
framing her face with a tangle of curls
and the smile which curved her lips now
and then bore still some relation to the
roguishness of her old expression
aside from these attractions and her
petite figure there was nothing to re-
mind him of the sylvia perrine that
wras

  he was truly amazed and could not
keep his gaze from her his admira-
tion heightened the color in her cheek
but her treatment of him was chilling
kemp could not realize that the proud
little lady and the girl whom he had
once likened in his mind to an indian
squaw were one and the same if she
had been piqued in the past by his neg-
lect of her she took ample satisfaction
for his crime now

  and she might easily punish him for
roger kemp had capitulated instantly
there must be recompense for most
things we do or suffer if kemp had
ignored sylvia as a child she had it in
her power to make him suffer for it
now  anti she proceeded to mete out this
punishment lavishly her coldness and

  brief replies to his most ingenious
speeches finally brought the old squire
himself to kemps rescue

  mistress sylvia is in an icy mood
this morning roger he cackled best
let her be women are kittle-cattle-
theres no understanding them come
boy  tell us someat of yourself what
brought ye home when the countrys in
such turmoil will ye try for military
glory which seems the fashion now

  i must admit that some such hope
is in my mind you have my sword
good master perrine and i have come
for it

  aye so i have cried the squire
according to all i hear the rebellion is
already put down so yell have little use
for the weapon if ye do not wear it
soon and he laughed again come
mistress to his daughter you know
where this famous sword is kept i have
no doubt 

  for the first time sylvia showed -con-
fusion her eyes sought kemps face
for one little moment but he was too
abashed by now to look directly at her
nor would he have understood her
glance had he observed it the girl re-
covered her composure instantly called
the black man from behind the squires
chair and gave him some instructions in
a low voice meanwhile the old man
continued hammering at the unrespon-
sive kemp with the hope of making a
spark fly somewhere

  whom do ye join roger he asked
among the great friends ye must have
made in england did none give ye let-
ters to my lord cornwallis  they tell
me some of his horse are already in our
neighborhood yesterday it was the
ragamuffin continentals who marched
by and i had my servants out with
arms guarding the place to-day i ex-
pect the kings troops will pass one
of the boys declare there is a party at
la we house already have ye been
there roger

  kemp admitted that he had spent the
previous evening with old barnaby
lamson meanwhile watching the girl
to see if she would show any conscious-
ness but her countenance was quite
placid
will o the wisp



  ha exclaimed the squire and
has this major john favor arrived
he has

  ho ho cried the old man xow
i see why ye are hurrying away from
the neighborhood again ye found the
british officer a tartar ive no doubt
we did have some little misunder-
standing said kemp gravely

  the old mans ejes snapped and he
ceased eating to watch his guest intently
while his ruddy face flushed a deeper
crimson aye aye he cried and
is that the bottom o this desire of thine
for the sword master roger a quar-
rel with the doughty major eh

  for the first time kemp saw some lit-
tle expression of interest come into syl-
vias countenance she caught her
breath suddenly and flashed a look from
her father to the young man but the
latter was so disturbed by the squires
words that he gained no advantage from
the girls new attitude he felt that he
must not leave a false impression as to
his future intentions yet he shrank
from coming to an open rupture with
the squire

  i am afraid that major favor and
i are not good friends kemp said
slowly but i do not intend to seek a
quarrel with him

 huh no no ye ever were a
mild-mannered young whelp snarled
the old man more milk and water in
your veins than good red blood i war-
rant ye and yet you will offer your
sword to the kings cause eh  luckily
the war is near over master roger
kemps cheek paled but he knew the
squires tongue of old he said nothing
in reply and at the moment a maid en-
tered bearing his long-disused sword
and belt wrapped in a length of home-
spun linen she gave the weapon into
mistress sylvias hands and the old
man began to cackle and gibe again

  ha wilt thou buckle on the heros
sword in true romantic fashion eh mis-
tress sylvia  although he mayhap has
come too late for the fair as the saying
is roger has a fine figure on which to
parade a red coat

  be still father the girl exclaimed
sharply

  she called the maid back thrust the
sword into her hands again and pointed
haughtily to kemp across the table
give it to the gentleman matilda she
commanded

  kemps confusion and anger set the
squire off into a brutal gale of laugh-
ter he was used to his daughters
usurpation of command and paid no at-
tention to her attempt to overawe him

  haw haw roared he his mottled
cheeks crimsoned and distended and his
wicked eyes twinkling what say you
to that sylvia  roger is as good a
tree as another to hang a uniform upon
eh  they say it needs nine tailors to
make a man and ive the idea it takes
near as many students to make a soldier
roger was always a brave man with the
books an by gad he played at soldier-
ing on training day with the best of
them i member what dye suppose
he would do in a real scrimmage now 
but kemp had endured quite enough
and as he rose to receive the sword
from the maid he interrupted the
squires harangue

  without intending disrespect to you
mr perrine who are a much older
man than i i must beg mistress syl-
vias permission to retire before i suf-
fer further indignity at your hands
your years protect you sir

  gad the bantam crows well it
pleases me to see ye show some spirit
master roger but ye need not take
offense at an old fellow who might have
been your father eh

  thank heaven you were not ex-
claimed the exasperated kemp turning
from the door quickly i shall not
come here again to be insulted indeed
considering the step i am about to take
i should not be welcomed here again-
even to enact the bulls-eye for your
shafts of wit sir i go to join the
american army at newark

  whats that sir cried the squire
stung instantly to vicious rage lumber-
ing out of his chair and striding after
kemp dye mean ive harbored a vil-
lainous rebel-that youve dared come
here under false pretenses 

  accuse me of nothing unbecoming a
gentleman master perrine  interrupted


top-notch magazine

kemp furiously i made no protes-
tations of loyalty to king george or
the cause you espouse i am a man sir
who will ever choose for himself and i
have decided which side i may take in
this controversy after weighing the
claims of both

  you dare beard me in my own house
sirrah gasped the squire id had
my blacks whip ye off the place had i
known this were your mood and if i
were twenty years younger yed not
leave this room without measuring that
sword ye bear gainst mine own

  abel perrine was once too honorable
a gentleman to threaten a guest-and
withal one who is withheld from reply-
ing kemp said savagely

  ha and abel perrine had never
before a rebel scoundrel to face him
down in his own house roared the
squire shaking his hairy fist before the
young mans face had i known what
ye were id sent for some of the kings
horse and delivered ye up to them ill
have ye know i give no shelter to a
traitor to the king

  before kemp could reply the door
was thrown open at his back by the
black man who had previously left the
room

  yo done got a visitor mars per-
rine  the serving man exclaimed
here be majah john favah fom
lawe house and sharp upon the
heels of the announcement the british
officer strode into the room

chapter viii

a hornets nest

in entering thus abruptly the morning

	room of perrine house major fa-
vor faced the excited squire and saw
as well mistress sylvia behind him but
he overlooked roger kemp who upon
the opening of the door by the servant
was somewhat behind it

   i speak with mr abel perrine i pre-
sume the british officer said scarcely
giving the squire a glance for his glit-
tering eyes had observed the girl in-
stantly and his gaze became focused
upon her

  sylvia drew back with a little gasp

and her lovely face grew white and
dead while into her eyes suddenly shot
the stony glare of fear

  her father and kemp wrere both too
deeply engaged in their observation of
favor to notice her emotion even when
the major swept off his hat and bowed
low to her

  i am indeed fortunate murmured
major favor to find mistress perrine
likewise so early astir

  then he looked back at the old man
who red-faced and gasping like a fish
suddenly removed from its element
stared at the major with bulging eyes

  i am so new a neighbor sir that
perhaps you do not know my name but
i hope to settle in this pleasant country
and i am glad that a small duty gave me
excuse for my early ride to your door
then suddenly although neither of
the trio who had occupied the break-
fast room previous to his unexpected
entrance said a word he became aware
of the presence of another person

  he turned questioningly to look at
kemp instantly his own face flamed
with color and his thin lips wonted to
sarcastic expression wreathed in a
smile

 what master kemp is it you
again then by heaven we are in-
deed well met

  kemp had had these few seconds in
which to recover some measure of his
composure mild as was his usual man-
ner and naturally patient with the old
man who had so insulted him at the
last he had been provoked to an expres-
sion of rage which he knew ill be-
fitted him but now although his pas-
sions wrere at white heat he gave little
outward sign of the turmoil within as
he returned major john favors scru-
tiny with a bold glance

  badly met i should say major
he replied have you a troop of horse
behind you this morning or are we man
to man

  the british officers cheek paled with
rage and he strode another step into the
room flinging to the door behind him
you will find me sir quite able to up-
hold any private quarrel i may have
without assistance
will o the wisp



  but not here sir said kemp swift-
ly dropping his studied coolness re-
member that we are in this gentlemans
home with a gesture toward perrine
and the frightened girl at the farther
end of the room another time-

  another time does not suit me
master kemp interrupted favor as
for this gentleman i understood that he
was a loyal subject of king george
but when i find you here-

  and you are right cried perrine
himself finding his voice a faithful
subject i am this fellow came here
under false pretenses i believed he was
loyal and i was driving him from my
house when yu entered major favor
i know who ye are sir and i shall prove
my friendliness toward you in future
time i hope but now i declare that it
is my wish and desire to see this young
hound apprehended as the traitor he
proves to be

  there was a faint cry from the lower
end of the room but the three men
were too excited to notice it or to look
at sylvia perrine had seized kemp by
the sleeve as though he feared he would
escape before he could explain his own
position to the british officer

  were i twenty years younger
vowed the old man id measure swords
with him myself here he daes come
to me and demand and receive his sword
from my hand letting me believe until
it is in his possession that he will offer
it to lord cornwallis and then-
then pursued perrine nearly frothing
at the mouth in his rage he declares
he is on his way to join that despicable
washington and his ruffians at new-
ark  you have it in your power to stop
him and i say do it he is a spy and
traitor i have no doubt and came into
this neighborhood for no good purpose
ill be bound

  favor seemed duriug this tirade to
measure the situation keenly he saw
what manner of man perrine was and
knew that in his rage the squire would
allow the laws of hospitality to be for-
gotten he now looked upon kemp
with authority

  hand me your sword sir you are
my prisoner he said i will not dis-
a

grace you-or our host-by fighting you

here but you must yield-

  sir exclaimed kemp-and his eyes
flashed and his bosom heaved with the
passion it contained-sir you have me
at some disadvantage and you would
take this foolish old man at his word
but let me tell you that no man shall
take this sword from me without first
proving himself able let us step
through yonder window to the lawn and
try conclusions if ye do not care to
await a more fitting time but if ye
would take my sword-then fight for
it

  at the ringing challenge john favors
sword leaped from its scabbard that
there was truth in kemps conclusion
spurred his rage the deeper and thus
roweled it knew no bounds

  ye shall have need to fight then
he cried guard yourself

  not here gasped kemp struggling
with the windings of the linen about his
weapon remember mistress sylvia 
at him man cried the wildly en-
raged squire to favor let him not
hide behind the skirts of my wench
the major after a swift glance
around looked again at kemp sneer-
ingly i see no lady here master
kemp will you fight me here and
now or shall i run ou through as you
deserve 

  kemp shot a glancc to the extremity
of the room and saw that noiselessly
and without a word sylvia had disap-
peared she had removed herself from
the scene that there might not be found
in her presence an obstruction to this
dastardly attack upon him

  that old abel perrine should forget
what was due his own honor as well
as the safety of his guest was not sur-
prising his passion once aroused had
always been ungovernable but even in
this moment of excitement and actual
peril kemp was moved by the appar-
ent heartlessness of the girl

  he remembered once finding her
years before on her knees in the barn-
yard at lawe house weeping bitterly
over the lamed leg of some mongrel cur
which had got under the horses heels
true she had flown at him in the guise
	top-notch magazine

of a little fury when she observed him
watching her jet kemp knew the hoy-
den had a tender heart in her bosom
because of this incident

  bitterly he told himself now that the
metamorphosis of the riotous tomboy
into a bewitching and lovely woman
had not added those tender graces
which more than aught else enhance the
female character her departure from
the room at this juncture was little short
of cruel

  and it seemed try as he might that
favor would disarm him if nothing
worse before he could wrench his own
weapon free of the clinging linen

  he was by far the lighter man how-
ever and he eluded the majors early
thrusts by leaping backward and from
side to side

  finally finding that he was not to be
given a fair field and equal favor and
believing his antagonist might really dis-
able him kemp kicked over a heavy
chair so that it fell directly in favors
path the major cursed him and
leaped the barrier

  but now kemp had freed his sword
hilt and with one motion drew the
weapon from its scabbard throwing
both scabbard and accouterments be-
hind him

  he deflected the majors thrust with
a skill which showed him no novice in
the art of sword play and instead of
following the defensive he charged
upon his enemy before the latter could
entirely recover from his leap over the
chair

  he bore favor back and back until
the bulkier man was halted by the wall
the clash of steel brought the servants
running to the room but the old squire
beside himself with excitement and
rage kept them back and out of the way
of the duelists the latter were so des-
perately intent upon the game that they
scarce saw anything but the whites of
each others eyes and the sparks which
flew from the blades

  thrust and parry undercut stroke-
all the various moves of the game as
practiced by the swordsmen of that day
were tried by the antagonists favor
was a more than ordinarily keen swords-

man although he knew little but that
which was taught in barracks if kemp
possessed a more scientific knowledge
of fencing his enemys greater bulk and
strength balanced such skill

  only for a moment did kemp man-
age to hold favor against the wall then
it was the other way-the american
was forced back and back across the
end of the room eluding the pieces of
furniture with consummate skill but un-
able to retard the advance of the brit-
ish officer

  he was being forced toward the long
windows opening upon the broad piazza
of perrine house these windows
opened like doors but through kemps
keenly awakened memory there flashed
the thought that the windows swung in-
ward had it been otherwise he might
have dashed them open and escaped
for he knew himself to be under the
present conditions no match for john
favor

  besides should the chance open for
him to thrust the major through how
could he do it here he knew he must
withhold his hand for although old
perrine had forgotten every call of
honorable decency he had not when
he had regained his self-control abel
perrine would never forgive himself if
murder were done in his house and
it was plain that favor was eager to see
a tragic finish to the bout

  suddenly however kemp felt the
chill outer air blowing upon him and
casting a momentary glance sideways
he saw that a pair of the windows had
swung softly open pushed by some hid-
den hand without for a breath he
feared the presence of another enemy in
his rear then he saw that neither his
antagonist nor the squire seemed to no-
tice the opening of the windows

  once again they began a circuit of
this end of the room the point of fa-
vors heavier sword had pricked kemps
wrist once and the wound smarted
perrine had thrown aside several pieces
of furniture to give them footroom and
the way being clearer and favor forc-
ing the fight kemp retreated more
swiftly than before

  suddenly above the clash of the
will o the wisp



blades and the screams of the women
servants the young man caught a noise
from without in the distance sounded
the rattle of horses hoofs along the
road they charged bearing down upon
perrine house

  whoever came by that road was no
friend of his kemp knew he could
not hope for succor but he dreaded the
appearance of the dragoons

  keenly as he was alive to every move
of his antagonist and unwavering as
were his blade and eye back in his brain
was the thought that whether favor
worsted him or not in the end he was
bound to lose the fight

  he heard the horses flounder through
a half-frozen puddle by the gateway

  kemp was indeed in a hornets nest
favors bloodshot eyes looked murder
into his own kemps obstinate defense
and skillful handling of his sword had
inspired the british officer to ungovern-
able rage

  although his enemys strokes were
more desperately delivered kemp dared
not risk a thrust for he had no wish
himself to kill the man the whole af-
fair had happened in the heat of mo-
mentary passion and he had no deadly
feud with the englishman

  his desire to escape with his life and
liberty however was kemps principal
thought if he remained although fa-
vor might not kill him the coming
troop of cavalry would surely make him
a prisoner some mysterious agency
had given him a single chance of escape
and he grasped it

  as they came around a second time
to the open windows he leaped sud-
denly sideways threw down a screen to
cover his retreat and plunged out of
the window upon the piazza just as the
troop of british horse came into view
charging furiously up the drive

chapter ix

mid the clash of arms

 ike the eager yap yap of the
 hounds when the pack sights the
fox rose the yell from the charging
squad of british horse as kemp sword
in hand whirled into view through the

open window in some way they had
learned of the presence at perrine
house of the fugitive for whom the
countryside had heen beaten during the
night and at once concluded that this
armed man must be he

  within the house was a great hulla-
baloo at kemps unexpected move the
shrieks of the women servants could
have been heard a bowshot away now
the angry voices of favor and squire
perrine added to the din they had
charged the open window by which the
prey had escaped and retarded by the
screen kemp had overthrown and both
eager to get through the opening first
the excited men blocked each others
efforts

  this gave the fugitive an instants
respite after his first glance at the
coming dragoons his eyes sought the
unknown friend who had opened the
swinging panes but the piazza was de-
serted he was free for the moment
the sweets of liberty wrould quickly turn
to ashes in his mouth however did he
not find some means of making it se-
cure

  the pursuit he principally feared was
that of the horsemen they could over-
take him far quicker than his recent an-
tagonist and believing that major fa-
vors horse was stili held before the
main entrance of the great house kemp
fled toward the rear

  the broad piazza its roof upheld by
fluted wooden pillars was built on two
sides as well as on the front of the man-
sion before the horsemen could send
a single ball in his direction kemp was
around a corner instantly he beheld a
horse upon the side driveway out of
sight of the dragoons it was the one on
which he had ridden from langdons
early that morning

  he was convinced the squire had sent
this horse to the stables when he urged
its rider to the breakfast table who
then had ordered it saddled again and
brought around here at this moment of
need 

  the horse was in charge of a small
black boy-squire perrine was one of
the several jersey colonists who owned
a number of slaves-and when kemp


top-notch magazine

darted into view the boys expectant
face wreathed itself in smiles he beck-
oned eagerly as the young man halted
in amazement and instantly kemp un-
derstood that the friend who had opened
the window for him had arranged this
as well he vaulted the piazza railing
and ran to the horse

  yo git erway by de orchard paf
mars roger  squealed the little darky
whom kemp now recognized as a one-
time personal retainer of the squires
harum-scarum daughter dat british-
ers hoss done been took to de stable
an hes saddles off by now git
mars roger git

  your mistress will have you whipped
for this ginger cried kemp as he
vaulted into the saddle

  yah yah don yo worry bout me
sih cackled the excited darky off
widjer

  he struck the horse a resounding slap
upon its flank and the beast sprang into
a gallop before kemp was fairly seated

 the escape had evidently been
planned before the dragoons came into
view yet kemp saw that it would be
best to follow instructions trusting
himself wholly to the guidance of his
unknown friend it was plain that al-
though squire perrine and his daugh-
ter were such rank tories there were
members of the household who sup-
ported the american cause

  his sudden appearance and bounding
into the saddle had startled what spirit
there might be in the sorry nag with
which hughey langdon had supplied
him and the beast needed no urging
through the rear premises of perrine
house he saw the stablemen watch-
ing from the doorways of the outbuild-
ings where they had been engaged in
the early morning chores but none
strove to thwart his escape

  kemp slapped the horse again with
the flat of his sword and shot into the
long orchard lane like a bolt from a
crossbow from the front of the great
house rose a confusion of voices evi-
dently the dragoons had halted to re-
ceive instructions from major favor
that retarded them but a minute be-

fore kemp reached the foot of the lane
the british horse appeared on his trail

  behind them came favor and the old
squire both shouting lustily to the
stablemen to bring up the officers steed

  between the pursuing phalanx and the
fugitive was the darky skimming the
ground like a winged mercury he
reached the head of the lane in advance
of the troop of horse

  a heavy tive-barred gate swung here
to shut off the lane making of it a pad-
dock for the horses or young cattle to
run in and with a flying leap the black
boy threw himself against it it swung
creakingly over on its huge wrought-
iron hinges and slammed against the
latchpost directly in the path of the
dragoons

  their shouts changed instantly to ex-
ecrations upon the darky who worming
himself between the lower bars of the
gate padded down the lane at top
speed paying but slight attention to all
the threats and oaths which followed
him

  he had another duty to perform and
kemp saw what it was and thanked
his unknown benefactor fervently

  the troop of horsemen had come so
suddenly upon the closed gate that they
were not prepared to jump it and must
either stop for it to be opened or wheel
back for a proper start before sur-
mounting the obstruction at this
lower end of the lane was another gate
and the darky boy intended closing it
likewise

  as kemp shot through entering be-
tween the rows of apple and peach trees
he saw that this was a much taller gate
and that probably no horse in the pack
of his pursuers would be able to leap
it the troop would be retarded at
both ends of the lane and every mo-
ments delay counted in his favor

  he knew the country very well he
had ridden to the squires hounds and
taken part in cross-country rides in
imitation of the old english custom
more than once in the past years free
of the lane and with the yells of pursuit
growing fainter in his ears he spurred
his steed to greater effort making for
a pass in the hills which would bring
will o the wisp



him out upon another highroad and one
which he hoped would be free of the
british troops

  the sounds of pursuit finally died
away when he topped a rise in per-
rines great sheep pasture he looked
back and saw the crowd of horsemen
at the lower lane gate one horse
seemed to be down and the troop was
still delayed

  he drew in his own mount laiowing
that the beast was laboring sorely and
pursued the way more slowly when
the redcoats came in sight again it
would be time enough to urge the crea-
ture to another heartbreaking effort
a cart horse cannot be expected to do
the work of a thoroughbred

  as he jogged on kemps thought
fastened upon the query that had been
in his mind since the moment he saw
the windows at perrine house swing
open affording him opportunity for es-
cape this query dealt with the iden-
tity of his unknown friend who was
there about perrine house who felt in-
terest enough to aid him

  as far as he had seen the darky boy
and the stablemen were all who had to
do with his escape yet there must have
been a governing mjjid-somebody in
authority at the head of the plan

  mistress sylvia and her father had
shown so plainly their unfriendliness
that he wondered much how any per-
son under the perrine roof dared aid
him who could it have been and who
in sooth had guided him across the
swamp from lawe house the night be-
fore  these two incidents and the trick
of the hand writing in fire seemed to
be all of a piece

  the root of the mystery was with
barnaby lam son kemp felt sure that
the old serving man could explain but
it might be many a day before he dared
call at lawe house again not only
had he lost hope of ever finding the
will of michael lawe but major john
favor was in possession of the property
and would hold it by might if not by
right the continental troops were be-
ing swept across jersey before the ad-
vancing redcoats and the volunteers

were mainly dispersed this part of
the country was completely lost to the
americans and he must ride as far as
newark before overtaking the army

  he rode through the narrow pass in
the hills and down to the old road be-
yond the day remained overcast and
chill and the sound of his horses hoofs
on the frozen earth and through the ice-
crusted puddles might be heard half a
mile away he could be tracked by
these sounds and remembering a hid-
den path which led around the town and
rejoined the highway beyond it he
forced his mount through the hedge and
into the open wood until he came upon
this sheep track

  it proved a rough way and already
the horse was badly winded kemp saw
that it could not keep up for long even
upon smooth ground if his enemies
appeared now he would have to surren-
der  but he hoped that he had succeeded
in throwing the dragoons off his trail
it wras now mid-forenoon and he was
still in the vicinity of morristown the
old horse fairly hobbled and kemp felt
some compunction in riding it farther

  suddenly he beheld several men run-
ning from the shelter of a clump of sap-
lings some yards in advance for an
instant he feared he had fallen into a
trap then he saw that he was not dis-
covered and drew up his tired horse
the strangers looked like farmer folk
of the vicinity and they skulked across
the path and descended the hill toward
the not far distant highway kemp
leaped from the saddle and pushed
through a brush clump afoot to watch
them

  they were surely not british men-at-
arms for they wore no uniform he
knew many of the american military
companies were not supplied with uni-
forms  but all were distinguished by
some bit of color or a cockade in their
hats

  cowboys or skinners by my soulf
muttered the fugitive

  and whichever guess proved true he
was not anxious to fall into their hands
although the first named were supposed
to be tories and the latter claimed
affiliation with the americans both

preyed upon the weak and helpless of
either party in the controversy

  he was on rising ground and could
overlook some considerable territory
below between the hill and a broad
marsh was the newark road the dis-
reputable-looking fellows had gained
shelter in a thicket and he dared not
move his horse while they crouched
there for fear they would see him the
steed stood with drooping head its feet
planted far apart and breathing sob-
bingly as though completely wind-
broken kemp dared call no pursuit
now even from men afoot

  the general demeanor of the group
below him precluded their being fugi-
tives themselves the secrecy they dis-
played in taking their places in the
thicket spelled peril to some traveler
being without weapon save for his
sword he had not the means to assist
any weaker party who might be the
lurkers prey but he held to his own
shelter and watched with breathless in-
terest

  he cast a glance behind over the path
by which he had come to see that no
enemy crept up in his rear he felt
himself in momentary danger-and
from more than one direction there-
fore the sudden sound of rapidly beat-
ing hoofs upon the frost-hardened high-
way excited him immediately that
only one horseman was coming saved
him from instant-and perhaps disas-
trous-flight

  the pounding hoofs were still at
some distance he glanced down into
the thicket where the men were lurking
and knew by their eager actions that
they meant injury to the approaching
horseman there were five of them
each armed with a long-barreled musket
or fowling piece and they lay in a po-
sition to sweep the road with a hail of
shot

  from the direction of the sound and
in consideration of the fears kemp him-
self had of being overtaken by the en-
emy he believed the approaching rider
to be a british soldier these men were
likely neighboring farmers or allies of
the patriot army bent upon harassing
the redcoats should he who had so

boldly espoused the american cause that
very morning try to save one of the
enemy 

  yet horror filled his soul at thought
of the coming rider being shot from
ambush to his mind even the exigen-
cies of warfare could not excuse such
a crime he was tempted to spring
from concealment and shriek a warning
to the victim

  yet he knew he could not be heard by
the rider and by showing himself
would only attract the attention of the
armed men had he possessed a pistol
he would have attempted a rescue for
a ball sent into the middle of the clump
of bushes might quickly disperse the
guerrillas men who would thus lay in
ambush for a victim must be cowards
at heart and easily frightened

  he heard the rider coming hotfoot
over the frozen road saw the guerrillas
in the thicket prepare their weapons
and knew that he could do nothing to
stay their hands-absolutely nothing
death was hovering over that lonely
spot and thus far kemp had been a
stranger to death it was as though he
were a spectator to a hanging with the
gruesome gibbet before him in readiness
for the victim

  there was a flash of color through
the wood the rider passed an opening
swiftly but so far away that kemp
could not tell what manner of man he
was or how he was dressed

  another flash of color appeared near-
er the thicket then kemp saw the
horse and rider the former a deep-
chested bay which carried its master
nobly the man leaned well forward in
the saddle urging the horse with whip
and spur kemp caught a glimpse of
a cocked hat and buff-and-blue coat--
the uniform of a continental the dis-
covery shocked him for he had believed
the endangered rider to be a kings man

  would the skulkers below in the
thicket let him pass the question was
asked in kemps mind and answered
in a flash-literally in a flash of gun-
powder the horse and rider reached
the thicket up rose the five guerrillas
and their pieces blazed simultaneously

  none of the bullets hit the fright-
will o the wisp



ened horse but the man flung his hands
above his head and rolled from the sad-
dle the horse spurned him with its
heels as he fell then continued its mad
gallop along the road while the guerril-
las burst from the bushes in an inef-
fectual attempt to catch the frightened
beast

  the highway curved here about the
foot of the hill and kemp standing
horrified above the bloody scene saw
that the riderless horse must finally cir-
cle around toward his own position
run as they might it would be long
ere the murderers could overtake it
but he had a chance to head it off

  risking exposure and the chance that
one of the five might still have a load
in his gun kemp broke cover and
dashed down the hillside he was in-
stantly observed and a wild shout went
up from the cowboys if he did not
reach the roadway in season to capture
the horse his fate would be that of the
continental this thought spurred him

  plainly the fallen soldier was dead
for all five of the guerrillas followed
the bay intent on heading off kemp
and without halting to rob their first vic-
tim kemp ran straight down the hill
soon losing sight of the scoundrels while
the hoofstrokes of the bay sounded
more faintly in his ears then they
grew louder the riderless horse had
rounded the turn and was coming down
the stretch toward the point at which
kemp hoped to intercept it

chapter x

washington

a horse will not run as well under
 an empty saddle as when feeling
the weight and guidance of a rider and
the bays pace began to flag before
kemp sighted it again but it still came
on so rapidly that the yelling cowboys
were well distanced while kemp him-
self was not at all sure that he could
head the beast off

  he risked his life and limb plunging
down the steep descent into the road-
way and when he reached it the bay
was not many yards away his appear-
ance startled the animal which stopped

throwing up its head and half wheeling
to return by the way it had come

  it was a desperately anxious moment
if the horse escaped him not only
would it fall into the hands of his en-
emies but those same enemies would
surely overtake him the fate of the
horses rider would be his own he had
now gone beyond the neighborhood fa-
miliar to him and these five guerrillas
were doubtless natives they could
easily run him down unless he caught
the horse and got away by its aid

  he sprang forward knowing that to
approach the creature slowly would only
give it opportunity to escape the rea-
son man controls creatures of such
greater bulk and strength than himself
is because of his ability to think quicker

  but the bay frightened by the explo-
sion of the guns and the fall of its rider
from the saddle was easily panic-
stricken now kemps approach was the
signal for it to rear upon its haunches
preparatory to taking the back track
fortunately for the fugitive however at
that very moment the guerrillas ap-
peared in sight and set up a yell of sat-
isfaction believing that kemp had lost
the horse and that neither man nor
brute could escape them

  in a flash the big bay wheeled again
standing almost upright when its fore
hoofs struck the frozen roadway kemp
gripped the bridle snorting and terri-
fied the bay tried to pull away but the
excited yelping of the pursuers fright-
ened it more than the calm voice of
kemp the latter ran a soothing hand
along the brutes back secured a grip
on the pommel and before the bay could
bolt again was in the saddle

  the horse was off like a shot there
was no stopping it then had kemp so
desired and he was only too glad to dis-
tance the scoundrels who had murdered
the former rider

  war is an awful thing at best but
this that he had observed in the lonely
piece of road was sheer murder so en-
raged was he with the bloody cowboys
that had the saddle holsters contained
pistols he would have tried to turn his
mount spur down upon them before
their weapons could be reloaded and

take summary vengeance for the con-
tinentals death

  there were no weapons in the hol-
sters however undoubtedly the soldier
had worn his horse pistols in his boots
--a trick not at all uncommon at that
time but as kemp fled on the bay
leaning forward in the saddle and gath-
ering up the reins with caution his
right hand sought the holster on that
side and his fingers clutched a packet
pushed well down into the pistol pocket
for the moment he was too closely en-
gaged in gaining control of the fright-
ened horse to go into the matter more
deeply but when the pursuers were dis-
tanced and the horse had settled into
an easy stride kemp drew the packet
from the holster

  before unpinning the bit of cloth
about it he was sure that its contents
were dispatches there had been more
than robbery in the shooting of the con-
tinental his capture of the horse was
perhaps a lucky stroke the documents
were valuable for upon the parchment
wrapper was written in a bold hand
these to his exctncy gen george
washington by jn cadwallader

  kemp was not so ignorant of colonial
affairs and of philadelphia in particu-
lar as not to know who john cadwalla-
der was the son of the philadelphia
physician was high in the best social
circles of the city of brotherly love
and to kemp had drifted the news that
cadwallader was not only a member of
the committee of safety but was a
warm friend of this virginia colonel
who had been placed in command of the
continental army these dispatches
then must be of moment

  it smote kemp at once that no better
introduction to general w ashington was
needed than this fortunate incident if
he could carry the papers himself to the
headquarters of the american forces
his introduction to the commander in
chief would be assured

  he was on an unfamiliar road but he
knew he was going in the right direction
it was not long before he began to pass
houses again for even in those days
there were not many untenanted lands
in jersey he had to ride slower how-

ever for despite the pluck of the big
bay it was plain he had been ridden
far by his former master kemp had
abandoned the wind-broken old plug
that hughey had found for him with-
out much compunction  but this bay was
far too fine a creature to ruin needlessly

  kemp saw people at their windows
or working about the cow yards these
were mostly decrepit men or women
and children nobody hailed him but
many gazed after him eagerly as he
pressed on his tired horse it was
strange that he met no scouting or for-
aging parties for if the british horse
was so near morristown and to the
westward of newark the orange
mountains should have been overrun
with these gentry

  so it was that when he did finally
sight a group of mounted men by the
roadside he greatly feared they were of
the enemy until he saw the cocked hats
and buff-and-blue coats it was an out-
post of general washingtons army

  the troop was patrolling the road
guarding that way into newark from a
possible flanking party of the enemy
when kemp came into view some of
them prepared to receive him in any-
thing but a friendly spirit the fugi-
tive however had already made up his
mind as to how best to meet such an
emergency and he spurred on his tired
horse waving the packet of papers
above his head

  his pantomime was understood al-
though nobody in the troop knew him
the dispatches spoke for themselves and
the flagging pace of the big bay told
more

  one man instantly dismounted and
led his horse out into the open road for
the dispatch bearers use the others
filed across the way to make sure of
kemps capture should he not prove all
right

  a glance at the directions on the out-
side of the packet reassured them how-
ever thats the fist of the captain of
the silk stocking company to be sure
declared the sergeant in charge of the
squad ye be in haste sir and your
horse is spent take this fresher one

  kemp was already out of the saddle
will o the wisp



and he ran to the other horse as soon as
the packet was returned direct me to
headquarters he begged this must
reach general washingtons hand im-
mediately

  where ye may find his excellency i
know not said the sergeant unless it
be at master heddens who is a stanch
old whig as ever was but yell meet
those farther on who may direct ye more
nearly

  the bay was led to one side but the
man whose steed kemp had mounted
did not instantly let go of that bridle
are ye bad wounded he asked curi-
ously

  no-tis only a scratch kemp as-
sured him as he gathered up the reins
displaying his wrist where major favor
had pinked him

  yeve bled like a stuck pig then
declared the man see the tails of your
coat sir

  surprised kemp turned in the sad-
dle but the horse under him feeling
him settled in the stirrups was eager
for the road he sprang forward jerk-
ing away from the restraining hand of
the private at the same moment a
shout rose from the group gathering
about kemps former mount

  see the blood the saddles full of
it stop that fellow roared the ser-
geant

  but kemp was already under way
and had his hands full with his new
mount he had obtained a single glance
at the saddle he had just vacated and
saw that it was splotched with crim-
son undoubtedly his own garments
were daubed with blood too-the blood
of the poor fellow who had been shot
out of the bays saddle

  to punctuate the order of the ser-
geant a pistol barked and kemp heard
the slug sing past his ear involuntar-
ily he leaned forward in his saddle and
the steed he had mounted raced away
without further urging it was a reck-
less act but blind impulse spurred him
to it to be halted and examined by
this squad regarding the death of the
unfortunate dispatch bearer was no part
of roger kemps plan

  with the dispatches in his possession

or with proof that he had delivered
them as promptly as possible he was
sure of a welcome at the headquarters
of general washington he determined
to go on now and risk investigation into
the matter afterward to be brought
a prisoner into the continental camp
despoiled of the dispatches which might
reach their destination by other hands
was not at all to his taste

  he risked the bullets and spurred on
fortunately the sergeant had selected
the best horse in his troop for the serv-
ice of the dispatch bearer and that one
shot was all that sped after the fleeing
man but some of the troop took up
the pursuit and for half a mile the race
was a close one

  the outlying dwellings of newark
were already in sight and through a
break in the wood across a great pas-
ture the fugitive saw a brigade of con-
tinentals marching along a parallel road
he knew he should soon be in the midst
of the army which had been billeted
upon the newark folk whig and tory
alike

  at that day the village was a bustling
place of not less than a thousand inhab-
itants and like most other jersey towns
almost equally divided in sentiment
neither whigs nor tories were passive 
when the american troops were in com-
mand the patriotically inclined people
forced their tory neighbors to remain-
very quiet indeed when the british
were near the shoe was on the other
foot just now kemp was sure had
the whigs come across that company
of cowboys who had shot the dispatch
bearer the five of them would have been
given short shrift

  he did not desire to fall into the
hands of any of the recruits for with
the troop of horse thundering down the
road on his trail it would be difficult to
urge the truth of his story therefore
he was glad when he- again saw bufif-
and-blue uniforms ahead and pulled up
his horse in the face of a file of infan-
try which with leveled muskets were
deployed across the highway

  dismount you sir exclaimed the
corporal in command give an account
of yourself


top-notch magazine

  i bear dispatches for general wash-
ington declared kemp boldly de-
tain me not for i am in haste

   and somebody comes in haste behind
ye remarked the corporal dryly
whom have we here not redcoats
ill be bound

  no no exclaimed kemp it is
true i am being chased by a troop of
your own horse but i could not stop to
explain see here are my dispatches
-from mr john cadwallader to the
general himself

  wait a bit wait a bit cried the
corporal seizing the bridle of the horse
as kemp would have pushed through
unless ye desire the feel of cold steel
hold in your beast well hear what
these who come in pursuit have to say
ha some of waynes lighthorse as i
live

  around a turn in the road came the
sergeant and his men and kemp de-
spairingly gave up all as lost hold
the villain yelled the officer immedi-
ately on seeing kemp and the infantry
hes likely a spy those dispatches
are stolen or my names ananias
hold him

  the footmen crowded around and
kemp was like to be seized and dragged
from his saddle he raised his bare
sword tempted to sweep it about him
and so clear the path and the threaten-
ing gesture made them stand back but
there were enough muskets pointed at
him for their charges to blow his head
to bits if he attempted escape

  naught but the sword in kemps hand
saved him from being borne at once to
the ground it looked as though he
would enter the american camp a pris-
oner  when these horsemen told their
story at headquarters he might have
great difficulty in satisfactorily explain-
ing matters

  but fate interfered most unexpected-
ly and in roger kemps favor before
anybody could lay hold upon him the
sound of other horsemen drew near a
cavalcade of rather brilliantly uniformed
officers was approaching and of a sud-
den both horse and footmen fell back
from the dispatch bearer and every
mans hand rose in salute kemp was

left alone in the center of the road upon
his restive steed

  the cavalcade was evidently in haste
but kemp barred the way and perforce
the officers must pull up out of the
way there sirrah exclaimed one very
pompous and red-faced gentleman who
rode in advance of the group who
are ye that blocks his excellencys pas-
sage 

  kemp had quickly controlled his
horse but now he did not give way his
glance swiftly overlooking the approach-
ing cavalcade he had never seen
washington in his life nor had he hap-
pened to come across a picture of the
great virginian but he picked him out
unerringly

  it would have been a dull man in-
deed who made a mistake in selecting
general washington in almost any gath-
ering aristocrat of aristocrats wash-
ington sat his white charger wtith an air
of command and a reserve of appear-
ance that made other men seem small
about him at first sight his austere
face and haughty aspect repulsed the
beholder yet mingled with these was so
much courtesy and his eye held so
kindly a glance that after a moments
hesitation kemp made bold to urge his
horse directly toward the commander in
chief

  hey there exclaimed the big man
who likewise wore the insignia of a gen-
eral reaching forth a hand to seize
kemps bridle stand and give an ac-
count of yourself

  i have dispatches for his excellency
cried kemp loudly to make sure that
general washington should hear dis-
patches from master john cadwalla-
der

  the horsemen were already riding by
but kemps voice had reached the ear
of the commander he glanced once
in the young mans direction but he
spoke to the bulky person

  bring me the papers and let the gen-
tleman ride with us sir was wash-
ingtons command

  ignoring the eager sergeant of horse
and the anxious corporal and their men
the cavalcade moved on with kemp in
its midst the latter had but a moment
will o the wisp



to feel relief at escaping a further ex-
amination with the soldiers he had out-
witted as witnesses against him

chapter xi

in the name of liberty

incident had fallen upon incident
so rapidly during the last few hours
that kemp had little time to think of his
personal affairs he rode away in
washingtons train delighted that he
had so easily gained the result craved
so heartily since his experience at the
langdon farmhouse

  this leader who so inspired the pa-
triots with confidence was really a re-
markable man kemp had felt it must
be so before now in this brief event of
his first meeting with washington he
wras assured that his judgment had not
been at fault - beaten as he was at
white plains driven back from the
hudson with the loss of the forts and
of a large part of his army general
washington did not have either the air
or look of a defeated commander

  there was sadness in his eyes and he
had a brooding brow but his depleted
ranks and overturned plans-the defec-
tion of his generals and the desertion of
many of the volunteers-could not
quench his sure spirit indeed one look-
ing into the great mans countenance
for the first time as did kemp gained
an everlasting impression that here was
a soul unmoved by disaster

  the cavalcade surrounding the com-
mander galloped over the frozen byways
about newark for the staff was on a
tour of inspection driven back from
fort lee by the triumphant legions of
cornwallis washington had hoped to
make another stand but it was not to
be from desertions by the volunteer
companies and the refusal of general
lee to make a junction wtith his troops
washingtons forces were depleted un-
til scarcely three thousand continentals
were gathered at newark they had
iain here now since the twenty-second
hoping to be reenforced but after five
days of waiting the british were re-
ported very near

  the dispatches kemp had brought

were read by the commander in chief
as the party circled the camp evi-
dently the information they contained
fulfilled the worst forebodings of the
chief officers kemp heard but little of
the discussion carried on by washing-
ton and his advisors for he rode be-
hind with the aids but every face was
downcast and they returned to the town
at last in a state of settled gloom

  little attention was paid to kemp on
arriving at the house where the com-
mander was stopping and he was left to
cool his heels in the yard until it be-
came somebodys pleasure to notice him
he was determined to wait for a chance
to make himself personally known to his
excellency

  the younger officers with whom he
had ridden dismounted and went about
their various affairs there was not a
soul he knew among them and they
looked upon him askance a man in
citizens dress who rode wildly to pre-
sent dispatches carrying a naked sword
in his hand and without even a hat
upon his head did not commend him-
self to the members of the staff kemp
appeared to be neither flesh fowl nor
good red herring

  there were several members of the
commander in chiefs guard-called
later the life guard-in the company
kemp knew them by their distinctive
uniform which was a blue coat with
white facings white waistcoat and
breeches ending in black gaiters while
their cocked hats were adorned with
blue-and-white feathers

  two guarded the door of the gen-
erals headquarters with muskets
crossed they carried side arms as well
the moments slipped by and nobody
spoke to kemp but the appearance of
the guards did not encourage him to try
to force himself into the presence of
general washington

  even in those comparatively early
days of the war the patriot cause was
cursed by the envy and unfaithfulness
of certain officers of the army with
many it was a struggle for personal
preferment rather than an ambition for
the establishment of the liberty of the
colonies washingtons character was


top-notch magazine

by no means understood by many of his
associates and history told of few great
military leaders whose success had not
ended in their becoming dictators it is
natural for one courtier to fear the ap-
proach of another near the throne few
of these officers desired to see n un-
known like kemp familiarly approach
the commander in chief who in their
minds might yet actually occupy the ex-
alted station of king

  one there was however who finally
spoke to roger kemp the latter had
seen this gentleman leave the house and
noted that he was treated with marked
respect by the subalterns standing about
although he wore only the insignia of
captain and too he came to kemp
with something of a cordial manner

  you are the gentleman who brought
the dispatches to his excellency from
general cadwallader he inquired sa-
luting kemp-a gesture which the lat-
ter was quick to acknowledge

  i brought the dispatches-yes

  you are in the service

  i am not but i come to offer my-
self to general washington as a recruit
i think i can easily assure him of my

identity and sincere intentions--

  you desire to see him then
queried the young officer

  i do sir i wish to explain as well
how i came in possession of the papers
which i delivered to him

  the desire seems to be mutual said
the other dryly follow me sir his
excellency has asked to speak with
you

  the moment was not auspicious for
meeting the commander of the army
no leader can be expected to appear at
his best when the fates are arraigned
against him disaster had followed dis-
aster of late and the future held noth-
ing bright in store for the distressed
leader of the rebel army yet washing-
tons countenance was unruffled as
kemp was led into the room where he
sat when the general looked up from
the papers before him in the perusal of
which he had been engaged kemp saw
only the sadness in his eyes the calm
face masked he was sure a soul much

wrought by the tempests of opposition
which assailed it from every direction

  here was a man indeed who fought
not alone the battles of his country con-
fronting an enemy outnumbering his
army in many cases three men to one
but fought the divergent opinions of his
brother officers and suffered from their
envy and treachery for all of these
leaders of the revolution were not great
and good men with liberty and the gen-
eral good of the new confederation at
heart many were rank adventurers
who like benedict arnold let personal
ambition overtop duty and patriotism

  your name sir queried washing-
ton measuring kemps slight figure
with commending glance

  even in his disordered dress and hat-
less as he was the young man was one
to attract more than a passing glance
he returned ones gaze boldly yet his
eye was mild and he could not be
termed a forward person rather was
he retiring his air marked plainly the
studious life he had led heretofore

  roger kemp an it please your ex-
cellency kemp said with a bow
perhaps my fathers name was not un-
known to all here-for the room was
filled with a crowd of officers and civil-
ians who at his presentation to the
commander turned to gaze upon kemp
as their mood dictated

  we dwelt much at philadelphia be-
fore i went to england from where i
returned but recently master ephraim
carney of philadelphia can vouch for
me he has some small affairs of mine
in his hands before going to oxford
and previous to my fathers demise i
was captain of a certain military com-
pany at morristown i have ridden
here sir to offer my services to the
cause of the united states of america
-hoping sir with another bow to
render myself so agreeable to your ex-
cellency that i may be found a place un-
der your own eye

  well well said washington per-
haps not unaffected by this speech for
he liked young and enthusiastic men
of that later let us take the matter
of the dispatches first you come from
my good friend cadwallader
will o the wisp



  i never met him in my life sir but
i know him by reputation responded
kemp smiling i knew that reputa-
tion so well that when the papers fell
into my hands through the death of their
original bearer i hastened here to de-
liver them

  he went on to tell his story briefly
his explanation that he was on the way
to offer his sword to the commander
when he saw the dispatch bearer shot
bore some weight likewise the fact
that he had had a brush with the brit-
ish horse in the neighborhood of mor-
ristown wras noted by the company

  i feared as much they are hot
after us gentlemen declared washing-
ton rising wearily if they do not at-
tack before morning it will be a bless-
ing and if they come in force we can-
not withstand them

  he turned again to kemp your
request i will weigh later i know mr
carney personally meanwhile i give
you into the care of captain polk
and he bowed to the young officer who
had brought kemp into the room i
shall not forget your effort to serve the
cause mr kemp good day sir

  it was a short dismissal but there
was something so kindly in the tone and
look which accompanied it that kemp
could not take offense he was glad
too to go with polk and obtain rest and
food before night captain polk had
found him a military coat and a hat
with a cockade besides a scabbard and
belt for his sword and a pair of horse
pistols by exchange with the sergeant
of horse who had endeavored to make
him a prisoner kemp obtained again the
big bay which had served him so well
and for which no owner could now lay
claim thanks to the cowboys

  he was billeted with polk and two
other young officers and found them
agreeable fellows although at first in-
clined to look upon him with some sus-
picion when general washington sent
word to him that he was to be attached
for the present to his own staff as aid
kemps messmates began to treat him
with marked cordiality that evening
however there was little time for them
to become acquainted

  kemps own report and information
from other sources assured the com-
mander in chief that the british were
endeavoring to cut off his retreat fight
he could not for ammunition was low
his troops hungry and ragged and corn-
wallis had more than two men to one
of the americans now left to washing-
ton retreat was ordered before day-
break of the twenty-eighth

  as the worn and hopeless troops left
the outskirts of newark on the road to
new brunswick the music of the brit-
ish bands could be heard entering the
other end of the town

  kemp had joined the army at a time
wthen the day seemed darkest to a
man of less positive convictions the con-
dition of the american forces and the
apparently hopeless state of the cause in
general would have utterly routed that
desire to join washingtons command
which had burned so heartily in kemps
breast since the night of his reappear-
ance in the neighborhood of lawe
house

  but once having made up his mind
that the cause of the rebels was just
and that he desired to be with his coun-
trymen liberated from the tyranny of
george iii and his ministers nothing
could shake roger kemps resolution

  bitter and long were the days that
followed and the souls of the men were
worn thin sickness hunger and
worst of all lost hope were the wolves
that tore at their hearts the rank and
file could not be blamed so much for
deserting patriotism thrives illy on
empty stomachs there was little glory
in prospect and had roger kemp sought
his position for the sake of the pomp
and panoply of war he would have de-
serted likewise

  but his heart was moved by the faith
and trust displayed by most of the men
in their chieftain whatever may have
been the feeling among the officers the
rank and file came nigh to worshiping
general george washington and mys-
teriously indeed this same impression of
the great mans character stamped itself
upon kemps soul he saw now how
true that answer in fire had been to
major john favors sneering query the


top-notch magazine

night they talked together at lawe
house

  liberty might be a will o the wisp
the cause of the americans might be vis-
ionary and seemingly impossible of suc-
cess but the inspiration of this chieftain
had led them thus far and kemp felt
it would lead them farther

  the bugle music of the flushed and
victorious army of the conquering corn-
wallis might greet the ears of their
rearguard as it left the towns to the oc-
cupancy of the enemy--newark new
brunswick princeton and trenton
wrere lost without a blow being struck
-yet withal washingtons superb
courage held the little body of troops
together

  long ere that awful retreat was fin-
ished kemp had given up his horse to
a weaker man and marched in the ranks
himself it was maddening to be so
helpless-to follow on behind the poor
fellows and behold here and there on
the frozen ground the bloodstains from
their broken feet

  there could be no enthusiasm under
such depressing circumstances the
ranks plodded dully the file officers
swearing and driving the men on like
beasts the torn banners drooping and
the shrill fife like the eerie shriek of a
lost soul rather than a ringing note of
encouragement

  well-disposed folk along the route of
march dared only bring the fugitive
army succor by stealth whereas a few
months before the entire jersey plan-
tations had been aflame with patriotism
ah that is a flower kemp learned that
blooms quickly and fades at the first
suspicion of the frost of disaster the
retreating army was obliged to take by
force in many cases what had freely
been offered them before

  so it happened that the first duty of
any importance whicn fell to kemps
lot was acting as guide to a foraging
party through a section of the country
north of princeton which he happened
to know very well it was with his aid
too that several boats were found when
it became evident that safety for the
american troops lay only upon the far-
ther shore of the delaware these

were small matters yet kemp hoped for
something better when the army should
be reorganized

  the broken lines finally escaped
across the river and having secured all
the boats for miles up and down the
stream it was put out of the power of
the british to follow until the ice should
become thick enough to bear up horses
and artillery cornwallis had left
guards in all the principal towns and
established at trenton fifteen hundred
hessians-some of the very savages
who had bayoneted colonel magaws
men a fort washington

  with the rolling river between the
enemy and the handful of continentals
washington stopped and with immense
optimism began to reorganize the army
the news from the champlain country
of arnolds defeat and the loss of the
american flotilla as well as clintons
successful descent on newport dark-
ened the cloud of doubt and uncertainty
which hung above the american camp
congress believing philadelphia to be
threatened departed for baltimore on
december twelfth but it took measures
to provide a permanent army and soon
gave his excellency almost absolute
power

  fearing dictatorship as they did this
was a last desperate resort in the
hands of another man the power given
the commander in chief might have been
misused and to the final and utter de-
struction of the cause of liberty to
george washington however it prom-
ised at length the ability to make his un-
der generals obey and to move the en-
listed brigades to some purpose

  the arrival of some pennsylvania re-
cruits including general cadwalladers
brigade and a part of lees division
swelling the army to some seven thou-
sand men gave heart to the faithful
even the young officers with whom
roger kemp associated knew that an
important move was at hand some-
thing must be done to give impetus to
the cause-to riveland clinch the wav-
ering hopes of the colonists-and the en-
tire army was on the qui vive as the
month of december drew toward its
close

chapter xii

in peril

the american camp was very much

	alive at this time the divisions
were quartered as far south as bristol
where general cadwalladers brigade
lay and it was kemps fortune to be
offered the command of a company un-
der this eminent friend of washington
by courtesy he was already addressed
as captain kemp but his only com-
mands were foraging parties or small
scouting expeditions in this last work
however he had been successful and
had received personal commendation
from his excellency therefore kemp
hesitated to accept a command that
would tie him to a brigade for the op-
portunities of a free lance were greater

  general cadwallader was a very fine
gentleman indeed and it was something
to be marked out by him as a subaltern
kemp realized the honor and when he
was called before cadwallader and the
commander in chief he strove to make
his position clear mr cadwallader was
rather a tall man with a long ruddy
beardless face and a very high forehead
his aquiline nose and prominent chin
betrayed both determination and haugh-
tiness and had it not been for the kind
interference of general washington
kemp might have found disfavor in the
eyes of the commander of the silk
stocking company-a term of good-
natured raillery which had stuck to cad-
wallader since the beginning of the war

  i have offered master kemp his
choice general washington said and
like the rash young man he is he has
chosen the alternative the honor of
being under your command sir seems
less to him than the chance of having
his neck stretched by the britishers-
though god forbid

  ah  exclaimed cadwallader you
have chosen captain kemp for that
duty 

  he has chosen himself as i tell you
it laid between him and polk i give
you polk and captain kemp crosses the
river before daybreak the matter is
arranged

  kemps eyes sparkled at these words

for although the matter of a secret visit
to trenton had been broached to him
he had not been sure despite what
washington called his own choice that
he would be allowed to undertake the
dangerous mission the moment was
ripe for an attack on the british forces
which were carelessly resting on their
arms-strung in a chain of posts across
jersey-while cornwallis was enjoying
the christmas holidays in new york
city

  after general lees capture his divi-
sion under sullivan had joined wash-
ingtons force quartered at newtown
and other troops were numerically in-
creasing the strength of the main army
almost daily yet washington would
not attempt to strike a decisive blow at
the garrison of trenton without having
the reports of its unpreparedness veri-
fied

  with several men picked from a corps
of scouts who had been under general
putnams personal command before that
officer was sent to take charge at phila-
delphia kemp left the headquarters on
a small branch of the neshamming
river at nightfall and rode hard over
the bad roads made worse by the
marching and countermarching of
troops and the heavy traffic of colonel
knoxs artillery to mcconkeys ferry
eight miles above trenton

  a mile from the ferry kemp ex-
changed his fagged horse for the bay
which he had sent on in advance at a
friendly farmers he changed his uni-
form for the dress of a foppish gentle-
man of that day and with a portman-
teau behind him on the saddle rode
down to the log ferryhouse as previ-
ously arranged although he crossed the
ferry with some of his men he did not
speak to them or they to him they
were dressed like drovers and their side
arms were hidden beneath their rough
coats

  the only thing kemp lacked as he
rode into trenton in the guise of a
macaroni from one of the southern
colonies was a body servant but he ex-
plained to the host of the inn that his
black man had been confiscated by a
party of continentals near harrisburg

-and his expressions of anger and dis-
gust over the incident left no doubt in
mine hosts mind as to kemps distaste
for the americans

  this play acting was not pleasant
but he was in peril and must use every
art possible to evade suspicion the
task of gaining exact information as to
the numbers of the hessian troops and
british lighthorse at trenton and bor-
dentown their means of communica-
tion and their preparedness-or lack of
it-to meet a quick sortie from across
the river was not unimportant and
if he an officer of the american army
was captured by the enemy in their
midst and in civilian dress the shadow
of the gallows would certainly fall upon
him

  his ability to learn that which wash-
ington and nis advisers considered nec-
essary and to do so without attract-
ing suspicion to himself was enhanced
by the fact that he understood and spoke
german and with this attribute and
his gentlemanly and cheerful bearing
it was an easy matter for him to be-
come acquainted with the young hes-
sian officers as well as those of the light-
horse quartered in the town

  kemp fell in with a certain lieuten-
ant piel and an ensign named von
drack in the public room of the inn
that very day and was taken by these
new friends about the town and to the
various quarters of knyphausens regi-
ment and rohls grenadiers

  colonel rohl was in command of the
garrison and he had gained with the
british officers a hearty contempt for
the rebels the men were allowed to
plunder from the peaceful inhabitants
of the surrounding country and the
lines were in no state of defense what
else could be expected of mercenaries
it was all a matter of gold to them
their masters had sold them for thirty-
six dollars a head to king george and
their only desire was to get out of the
conflict alive and gain such portable pos-
sessions as they could gamble away and
drink up during the long winter nights
an attack from the beaten continentals
was not dreamed of

  the purchase of the hessians for the

american campaign was a most atro-
cious act condemned in parliament and
it brought over many right-thinking
englishmen to the american cause
they were merely trained fighting ma-
chines but it must be admitted they
were as savage as st legers indians
altogether seventeen thousand five
hundred and twenty-six of these hired
butchers were bought from the land-
grave of hesse-cassel the duke of
brunswick the prince of hesse and
the prince of waldeck and in almost
every battle in which they had a part
there were atrocities committed

  so disliked were these foreign sol-
diers that the british would not them-
selves associate with them the young
officers whom kemp met were delighted
that a white gentleman should show
them any attention and therefore it
was the easier for him to gain the in-
formation which he sought he spent
half the night with piel and von drack
and in the morning he managed to see
one of his drovers and sent him back
across the river with a written report to
general washington

  this was the day before christmas
and great preparations were being made
for the celebration of the holiday kemp
himself was invited to a banquet to be
given by the junior officers of the hes-
sian troops on christmas night he
saw that unless warned in season the
enemy would fall an easy prey to the
american arms if general washing-
tons plans were carried out

  but every hour kemp delayed his de-
parture from trenton increased the dan-
ger of his apprehension until relieved
or instructed to return to the army he
was bound to stick to his post with
this anxiety on his mind he was ex-
pected to be gay and cheerful as the sea-
son demanded and to act a part that
was at the best quite foreign to his real
nature for roger kemp was no fop
and the ribbons and laces the powder
and wig and the various niceties of his
present toilet were not to his taste

  he nevertheless strutted in the tap-
room of the inn among tory gentles
and officers alike and was not unpopu-
lar with those whose acquaintance he
will o the wisp



made there were few in trenton at
this time who dared flaunt their patriot-
ism and although the cause of the col-
onists looked so desperate nearly every
house in the town displayed signs of
cheer on christmas eve the ruther-
ford and dickinson mansions were
ablaze with light and there wrere sev-
eral private dances as well as two mili-
tary balls planned for the evening

  many of the officers under count
donop in garrison at bordentown were
in trenton to attend these soirees and
kemp wished that washington and his
board had planned to strike the blow at
this time the disorganization of colo-
nel rohls command seemed complete

  the weather had turned colder and
therein was another worriment for
roger kemp suppose the delaware
should freeze to a thickness which would
interfere with the passage of boats yet
too thin to uphold the troops which
washington had determined to throw
across the stream with the possibil-
ity of natures taking up arms against
the patriot cause before him the young
man must appear among the acquaint-
ances he had made at the tavern as
though he were perfectly light of heart

  a dozen times he went to the door
however to assure himself of the in-
creasing cold wheels creaked in the
streets and the ring of horses hoofs
could be heard at a long distance mine
host of the tavern came out rubbing his
hands delightedly and pronounced it
ideal christmas wreather-when kemp
would have given his fortune for a
thaw

  this tempers us all sir declared
the round and ruddy host with satis-
faction to the real holiday spirit
therell be a good bit of gold in my till
before morning and-ha -whats
this  more guests pon me soul and
never more welcome than now

  he bustled down the stair as a heavy
traveling coach drawn by two big
horses turned into the street with the
plain intention of seeking the tavern
kemp would have turned away idly had
his attention not suddenly been attracted
to one of the men who sat stiffly upon
the coachmans seat but who the in-
a

stant the carriage stopped climbed ac-
tively down

  barnaby lamson-or his wraith 
muttered kemp drawing behind a pil-
lar and wrapping his cloak about him
so muffling the lower part of his face
what-and who-brings him here 

  the tavern keeper bustled forward to
open the chariot door before the old
serving man from lawe house could
accomplish that duty it was then
kemp made other discoveries a sin-
gle rider rode hard after the chariot
and the instant this man gained the il-
luminated space before the inn kemp
recognized him as well as the other
man on the coachmans seat the horse-
man was major john favor the driver
of the chariot was granby the majors
man and it was then easy to see that
the vehicle itself was the one which had
broken down near lawe house on the
night of his first meeting with favor

  favor swung himself out of the sad-
dle and began stamping his benumbed
feet upon the ground slapping his
gauntleted hands meanwhile his
resonant voice echoed across the court-
yard before the inn as he addressed
barnaby lamson open that door
old man by my life you and the fat
man are as clumsy as though ye had no
hands at all dost want the lady to
freeze open it i say

  together barnaby aad the innkeeper
finally accomplished the task the door
of the carriage flew back and at once
a silvery little laugh rippled out upon
the night air

  ah major favor we have been as
warm as a breakfast urn in here while
you have chilled yourself on horseback
come father we have arrived at
last

  the speaker leaped out disdaining
the assistance of the hands outstretched
to her and turned to call back into the
depths of the carriage kemp uttered a
smothered exclamation of surprise it
was mistress sylvia perrine and no
other

  through the busy days wdnch had
followed that never-to-be-forgotten
morning at perrine house when kemp
had defied the ladys father and the


top-notch magazine

scene had ended in his chance duel with
favor the young american had often
thought of sylvia as she had been re-
vealed to his eyes at that time it was
easy enough in sooth to conjure a vi-
sion of the beautiful girl as she haugh-
tily welcomed him at her fathers table
kemp in those few moments had been
deeply moved

  his old remembrance of the squires
hoyden daughter was quite blotted out
now when he beheld her disembarking
from major favors chariot before the
trenton tavern his heart leaped again
and there stirred in the depths of his
being a feeling new to his experience
jealousy awoke

  heretofore he had recognized major
john favor as a rival claimant to the
property which kemp was assured old
michael lawe intended for his benefit
now favor appeared in the guise of a
rival of another kind there could be
no misunderstanding of the british offi-
cers attitude toward little mistress per-
rine and the familiarity of his tone and
manner spurred kemps sudden rage

  run in run in i pray you mis-
tress  urged favor as the old squire
with much groaning and no little pro-
fanity climbed out of the deep interior
of the carriage the air is shrewd
and a hot nog and a warm fireside yell
find een more comfortable than yon
carriage

  the main door of the inn had been
flung hospitably open by now and the
lights streamed out serving men and
maids lingered about the entrance curi-
ously to watch the new arrivals and the
hostess came forward with unctuous
smile seeing that there was a lady in
the party

  kemp held his ground sure that his
disguise in the height of dandyism
would shield him from recognition by
any casual glance

  mistress sylvia with a laugh
mounted lightly up the stair her ample
skirts held up modestly in front to ad-
mit of her taking the steps without trip-
ping

  the glare of the light pouring from
the house wasin her eyes and she
mounted heedlessly during the mid-

dle of the day the suns warmth had
let the melting ice from a leaking drain
drip upon the steps and these drip-
pings had now frozen just before
mistress sylvia reached the top of the
stairs she trod upon a patch of this ice

  kemp alone saw her sway and drop
her skirts reaching forth both hands
quickly to save herself but she would
have fallen-perhaps been sorely in-
jured-had the disguised american offi-
cer not sprang to her aid

  one stride and he was at the head
of the stairs and had seized her as she
fell backward the landlady cried out
in alarm and all eyes were turned upon
the two figures at the stairhead out-
lined clearly in the glare of yellow lamp-
light

  zounds ejaculated the squire in
his high-pitched angry voice whos
that scoundrel unhand my daughter
ye villain

  he charged up the steps but favor
was before him big as he was the
british major was quick of movement
to see mistress sylvia in the arms of
an unknown man gave him a deeper
pang perhaps than it did her father
but he understood the cause of the in-
cident before he reached kemp and his
sweet burden

  helplessly she had fallen into the
circle of kemps arm and he had raised
her quickly against his breast while re-
taining his own balance by a desperate
clutch upon the pillar at his side

  for a long moment he held her so
and he knew that she breathing quick-
ly but without uttering a cry of fear
gazed into his face he dared not think
of what she might have discovered
there if she cried his name he was lost
-perhaps a dead man yet his first
feeling was one of delight at holding
her even for that brief time against
his breast

  it was over in a minute however
securing his own footing he placed her
gently on the top step and his arm fell
away from her reluctantly

  pardon my boldness mistress but
the occasion seemed to- warrant it he
said huskily bowing over her gloved
hand and so hiding his own face from
will o the wisp



the glare of the light as perrine and
the major came up the stair

  you are pardoned sir-and i thank
you she returned her voice as calm
and unshaken as it had been that morn-
ing in her fathers house

  had she recognized him nothing
in her voice or manner betrayed any
suspicion of his identity could he hope
for equal fortune with her father and
with favor who were now at hand

chapter xiii

a knocic at the door

the girl went quickly into the inn
with the wife of the host she did
not look around even to bow to kemp
again but he had recovered his nerve
when major john favor reached the
spot

  gad sir i beg to offer my thanks
exclaimed the officer in his bluff way
your quick eye and hand saved the
lady from a serious fall he turned
to perrine as the old gentleman puffed
up the stair behind him did you see
it sir she would have fallen had this
gentleman not interfered

  oh-aye exclaimed the squire
rather grudgingly it seemed and staring
at the muffled kemp in a suspicious
manner  tis lucky then i thought
that-

  t am sure master perrine wishes to
thank you interrupted major favor
with a smile seeing that his companion
was not yet sure whether to accept this
explanation of kemps familiarity with
his daughter or not

  of course of course grunted per-
rine

  let us say no more about it gentle-
men returned kemp bowing gravely
your servant sirs and he turned
swiftly and went into the taproom to
escape the group of gaping and curious
people which had gathered

  but he was not to close the incident
so easily secretly he smarted because
mistress sylvia had taken his assistance
so much as a matter of course after
that first moment she had not even
glanced at him but when the idea

finally got into squire perrines head
that the young stranger had really saved
his daughter from injury he pursued
kemp with attentions

  this was later in the evening and
after the old gentleman had become
thawed out by sundry potations of the
landlords brewing major favor had
gone out into the town to hobnob with
the officers of the british horse there-
fore kemp had not his keen eye to fear

  i declare fort master said the
squire seeking kemp out in his quiet
corner and taking a seat without as
much as by your leave they tell
me i should ask your pardon for my
roughness but zounds theres so
many cursed gallipots about these days
bold enough to run off with a girl before
her fathers very eyes that i did not
know but you might be one of em
and the old man cackled punching a
pudgy finger at kemps ribs

  you do not flatter me sir kemp
said dryly

  the old gentleman started and
glanced keenly into his face evidently
kemps voice seemed in some degree fa-
miliar to him but the powdered and be-
ruffled macaroni with whom he sought
to strike up an acquaintance fitted into
no very clear remembrance in squire
perrines mind

  ha a man must be careful who
speaks to his womenfolk these times
growled perrine i tell ye sir we
americans are in evil odor enough as it
is-and before major favor gad sir
the girl is all but promised to his honor

  kemps face was a mask which be-
trayed no emotion nevertheless the
lips which formed his question moved
stiffly if the old man had but noted
them your daughter is betrothed to
the officer sir 

   if shes not she will be by gad de-
clared perrine smiting his fist upon the
table these women are kittle-cattle
theres no knowing their minds they
dont know em themselves but shell
come to my way of thinking now i
tell ye j and major favor is a fine
man of great family-he may be lord
favor some day-and has recently
come into broad lands right here in the


top-notch magazine

colony twill be a goodly match for
both of them will you drink with me
sir

  you must excuse me to-night
mumbled kemp getting up abruptly i
must leave you

  and mighty abrupt ye are about it
ejaculated perrine in some heat im
not good enough for your honor i sup-
pose  i dont sport ribbands and vel-
vet cloak but ive broad lands of my
own boasted the half-drunken old fel-
low

  kemp halted to look down at him in
scorn your poverty or riches affect
me but little master perrine he said
sharply i do not desire however to
cultivate the acquaintance of a man who
sells his daughter for a british title
good night sir 

  he was sorry instantly that he had
so spoken for he left an angry and a
suspicious man behind him kemp was
angry with himself too his usual cau-
tion and self-possession had deserted
him for the minute and for what  why
should he take an interest in the affairs
of mistress sylvia perrine she was
nothing to him-could be nothing to
him he knew that very well

  as a child he had disliked and derided
her now without rhyme or reason he
was jealous of every other man who
came near to her she had shown him
plainly that she was not interested in her
old friend and playfellow undoubtedly
she too was dazzled by favor and was
only coquetting with the british major
intending to plight her troth with him
in the end

  kemp sought his room but on retir-
ing found it impossible to sleep for a
time and not alone was the disturb-
ance in other parts of the inn the cause
of his wakefulness he could not get
mistress sylvia out of his troubled
mind nor could he close his eyes with-

out involuntarily calling before his men-
tal vision a picture of her piquant yet
haughty face the uncertainty which
had harassed him earlier in the evening
regarding the outcome of washingtons
plan for the advance on trenton was
forgotten in this personal trouble

  and it was really a serious trouble
he could not hide from himself that he
had fallen deeply in love with sylvia
perrine that the little hoyden he had
once scorned had grown to be a woman
whose charms he could not resist that
she and her father were bitter oppo-
nents of the cause he had espoused
made no difference to kemp the fact
remained that he had acquired an over-
whelming desire for one who seemed as
far removed from his reach as was ulti-
mate victory from the rebel forces

  and while he tossed in this mesh of
despairing thought he was startled by a
sudden summons on his chamber door

  not that it was a commanding knock
but the fact that one should desire to
see him at this hour of the night at all
startled kemp into a sudden realization
of his danger

  a moments suspicion might cause his
undoing he was a spy and the gibbet
threatened him

  he lay for several minutes listening
acutely then the knock was repeated
and a voice whispered shrilly the name
by which he had clothed his identity at
the tavern it was useless to feign
sleep for his caller was evidently a de-
termined soul and might yet raise half
the house in his endeavor to reach him

  kemp rose quickly slipped on his
nether garments lighted a candle and
sword in hand approached the door

provincial curiosity

he tall gray man of soldierly
bearing with the monocle and
the drooping mustache passed
along the deck for the fourth
time in his huge plaid ulster
and fore-and-aft cap i dont know
anything about it remarked the talka-
tive yankee tourist in the steamer chair
but ill bet you a dollar thats sir
percy vandeleur the new ambassador
why queried the man in the next
chair turning a weary eye on the busy-
body

  ive got a hunch thats all an-
swered the american the papers said
that sir percy would go to the united
states incognito accompanied only by
his valet hes only just got back from
india you know and he wants a rest
so the papers said hed come over alone
and his household and suite would come
on another steamer i chased up the
purser this morning and asked him to
tell me this mans name he said the
man was down on the list as captain
torrance and thats all hed say but he
had a sly look in his eye and i wasnt
born two years ago my friend

  i dont know as i care particularly
whether that man is sir percy vande-
leur or the duke of wellington re-
turned the other steamer-chair lounger
who had not taken a cheerful or broad
view of anything since the ship passed
out of sight of fishguard

  the talkative tourist merely smiled
his nerves and stomach were unaffected
by the cradle of the deep but he had a
sort of understanding

  youll feel better by to-morrow he
said sympathetically if you would eat
some dry codfish or chew some com-
mon spruce gum like i told you youd
be all right in an hour say ive a great
good notion to speak to that graven
image when he passes us again hes get-
ting on my nerves

   look where it comes again 
quoted the bored traveler ironically
dont bother on my account sir if
the man is sir percy vandeleur i am
content that he should remain so as
quietly as he pleases and that could be
none too quiet for me

  the tall man was again approaching
the pair of observers and as he drew
near their chairs the inquisitive one sat
up straight smiled pleasantly and with
assurance and piped cheerily


top-notch magazine

  good morning sir percy

  the man in the plaid nlster stopped
as if a shot had halted him

  my word he exclaimed really
you have the advantage of me sir

  im frank h warren of taunton
massachusetts replied the american
eagerly im pretty well known in that
section in the shoe business pleased
to meet you sir percy hope youll like
our country as well as your predeces-
sor

  the tall soldierly man surprised the
indifferent traveler by raising the cor-
ners of his mouth in something like a
smile

  you have been misinformed sir
he said quietly i have not even heard
that sir percy vandeleur was to sail on
this steamer ah by jove i dare say
i should thank you for the compliment
of taking me for sir percy ha ha

  mr warren of taunton cast a fur-
tive and meaning glance at his indiffer-
ent neighbor then he said somewhat
flippantly to the englishman

  oh thats all right-er-captain
torrance i understand these little dip-
lomatic matters i reckon it does you
credit to want to keep out of the lime-
light as long as you can and you can
depend on me captain to keep mum-
i respect a mans notions-have em my-
self not another crack will i make
about sir percy youre captain tor-
rance  thats enough and i think you
can depend on this gentleman here
and he indicated the man in the next
chair with a lateral movement of his
thumb

  the indifferent traveler changed his
position uncomfortably and cast a cold
glance at the tall man in the ulster

  if youre anxious about me he mut-
tered why rest easy i dont care if
i dont talk to a living soul for a month
if the pope of rome came up and
spoke to me i wouldnt take the trouble
to tell my wife about it thats the way
i feel

  i assure you gentlemen returned
the distinguished stranger i do not feel
the slightest anxiety as a simple tour-
ist traveling for pleasure i surely have
nothing to conceal or feel anxious about

good morning gentlemen and he set-
tled the fore-and-aft more firmly onhis
head and resumed his measured pacing
of the deck

  whatd i tell you chuckled mr
warren when the englishman had
passed out of hearing by little more than
an inch i nailed him with the goods
thats the way to do it now im go-
ing to cinch it his valet is a little
dried-up shrimp of a man im going
after him a dollar bill will turn the
trick or ill go back to taunton and
stay there

  youre a wonder groaned the other
man and turning his wan hopeless face
away from the exuberant man from
taunton he fixed himself a little more
uncomfortably in his steamer chair and
gazed dully out over the limitless heav-
ing brine

proof positive

defore the laurentic was more than
two days on her way to new york
every soul among the first-cabin pas-
sengers had the secret-that the distin-
gue captain torrance was no other
than sir percy vandeleur the new
british ambassador to the united states
traveling mysteriously incognito and
all through the earnest efforts of mr
 frank h warren in whom a clever
press agent was lost to the show busi-
ness through the allurements of the shoe
trade

  captain torrance took the inquisi-
tiveness of his fellow travelers with a
commendable good grace the eager
overtures of the celebrity-hunting peo-
ple broke down the chilly reserve which
he had maintained at first and by the
third day he was actually joining in the
vapid conversation of the smoke room

  he talked more and more freely as
time went on and apparently got so far
off his guard as to ask pertinent ques-
tions about american life especially
that of the city of washington

  the taunton man was not observed
to efface himself in these conversations
and he tried slyly at times to lead the
by courtesy of the port



englishman into matters pertaining to
the diplomatic service

  i never had time to dabble in poli-
tics he said during a general chat
among five male passengers including
the englishman but i always thought
id like to b a diplomat

  if youll permit me ill venture to
say that you are one already mr war-
ren remarked the man who had taken
so dark a view of life on the first day
out with a wealth of irony the man
had made his first appearance in the
smoke room that day and while still
pale and a little cautious as to his move-
ments he was able to view his surround-
ings with at least a cynical humor

  oh i mean the real article con-
tinued the taunton man unoffended
and unabashed these diplomats get
into the insides of everything you know
theyre the whole thing everywhere
they have the respect of all the big
people and perquisites-more than
they know what to do with wrhy they
can tote anything they want right into
the country free of duty

  aint that so captain torrance he
added in a sudden flash looking at the
mysterious englishman pointedly

  i dare say it is i believe i have
heard as much answered the captain
dryly palpably amused

  so it went on the captain played
bridge promenaded with some of the
women indulged condescendingly in
games of shuffleboard and made him-
self something of a reputation as a good
fellow but he evaded all the tricks
that were planned to force him to an
admission and the passengers got their
sole satisfaction in the fact that he never
once positively denied that he was sir
percy vandeleur

  warren came upon the indifferent
traveler tramping the deck boldly on
the fourth morning of the voyage

  say he cried taking the man fa-
miliarly by the arm ive got itn at
last

  well murmured the man stop-
ping and leaning against the rail as
though suddenly tired

  its hardly decent of me to tell about
it continued warren but youve been

sort of in on the game from the first
and i know youre interested in it

  oh very agreed the man with a
look of resignation

  well-you mustnt tell of it-but
this is how it worked out began the
busybody you know me and his
knobs have been getting kind of thick
for the last day or two well last
night after all you fellers had turned
in i was left all alone with him in the
smoke room we got sort of confi-
dential-both of us-and while he
didnt let on anything about himself in
so many words he loosened up and
agreed to do me a favor

  id been telling him he went on en-
thusiastically how business was kind
of poor and i hadnt really ought to
have taken a european tour this year
and i told him how i got foolish over
in amsterdam and bought my wife a
stunner of a pearl necklace and i was
afraid when i come to pay the customs
rake-off on it i wouldnt have moren
enough left to get up to taunton

  well sir he came right out like a
real sport and let on that hed take the
necklace right in for me along with his
personal stuff and wouldnt have to pay
a cent on it thats what i call being
a real sport and believe me i was
game enough to respect his confidence
i didnt so much as let on that hed
given himself away at last i just said
thank you captain torrance any-
thing in the city of taunton that im
good for is yours sir and we went on
talking like wed known one another for
years i gave him the pearls too be-
fore i went to bed and itll save me
enough to pay my taxes

  the recipient of the spirited confes-
sion did not manifest an interest en-
tirely commensurate with the expecta-
tions of the narrator he listened in
silence and his habitual skeptical smile
gradually broadened into a grin

  a fine chance for a scandal in dip-
lomatic circles he remarked at last
of course mr warren you will not
allow your enthusiasm to get the better
of you it seems to me that your friend
has placed his reputation in your hands
the secret is safe with me i assure


top-notch magazine

yon but i wouldnt trust it to go any
further if i were you

  the dyspeptic-and therefore skep-
tical-man observed the person from
taunton with idle interest the rest of
the day several times he smiled broad-
ly as he saw him in furtive conversa-
tion with various members of the first-
cabin crowd it was evident that frank
h warren did not wish any one to walk
in darkness as to the real identity of
the mysterious passenger

chapter iii

growing popularity

fyn the fifth day captain torrance
strolling alone upon the deck met
a fellow passenger and paused to talk
with him

  i hope youll pardon the effrontery
captain torrance ventured the man
one hiram w rider from chicago
but fve sized you up as a man-with
a heart in the right place im not go-
ing to dig into things that are none of
my business rest assured sir you may
be captain torrance and you may not
but youre a gentleman

  thank you mr rider said the
englishman simply and now sir in
what way can i be of service to you
mr rider flushed and fidgeted an
answer to the direct question seemed
to be a hard thing to manage

  ill tell you captain he said pres-
ently im in the jewelery business in
a small way ive been looking round
the european markets and i picked up
here and there a pretty fine lot of unset
diamonds now id like to get them
passed through the customhouse with-
out paying anything and i reckon sir
that youre the man that could do it for
me i understand sir that you have
the courtesy of the port

  mind i dont want to know especial-
ly what goes on that doesnt concern me
i dont care a hang whether youre in
disguise or not if i can get this put
through for me why sir ill be made
in business

  as the man talked the englishman
gazed at him in blank amazement at

the end of the speech he exploded but
in a characteristically reserved manner

  ext-traordinary he exclaimed
by jove sir some chaps would lay a
cane over your shoulders for less good
tord you walk up to me deliberately
accuse me of being a person other than
i represent myself to be and insult me
in the same breath with a proposal that
is nothing short of criminal pray sir
what do you think the-er-the tor-
rances are surely i do not pass for
a rotter that would descend to petty
swindling

  mr rider of chicago was not as
much impressed as he should have been
thats all right-let it pass sir per-
i mean captain torrance of course
you have to be careful but every man
has a right to pick tip a little when he
has the chance in public office there
aint so many kinds of pickings that a
diplomat has a chance to get next to
i wasnt asking the thing as an out-and-
out favor you see i expect to come
across with a little something for your
trouble i dont expect to get a favor
like that for mere nothing get me

  captain torrance regarded the man
in cold silence

  it is evident he said finally that
that amazing american mr warren
has broken his agreement with me he
seemed a decent sort and i agreed to
do him a small favor-there was no
harm in it but by jove  i didnt think
hed make common talk of it all i-
why i dare say hes off telling the sec-
ond-cabin people all about it by this
time

  now my friend lets dispense with
all the other preliminaries broke in
mr rider impatiently you wouldnt
deny a fellow a little help like i want
it dont cost you anything and it sets
me on my feet ready to buck competi-
tion never mind what warren told
me you can rest easy that he wasnt
giving his own game clean away nov
you just take this little package-theyre
all in it--and when we get ashore on the
other side ill come and get them from
you naturally im anxious about the
outcome of the thing but there are some
officials in high office sir who would
by courtesy of the port



jump at the chance to pick up a little
cigar money and do a friend a turn
without running any risks im not try-
in to get my goods through free and
clear for the sake of talking about it
my mouth is as tight as they make em
when it comes to a case like this

  have a cigar while you think it
over he added extending his leather
case to the englishman

  the latter took a cigar and examined
it critically before he lighted it

  ah-hm-its very evident he
murmured presently that i have got
myself-what do you americans say
-ah in wrong as it were by inno-
cently doing mr warren a favor i
dare say that he meant no harm really
but by jove he does chatter a bit
doesnt he

  come now one more small package
wont make a bit of difference captain
torrance persisted mr rider

  the englishman laughed dryly but
my dear fellow he protested why in
the world do you ask me to smuggle
diamonds for you  i say how can i do
it any better than you yourself 

  oh come now returned rider
im not so raw as warren im not
going to stand up here and accuse you
of being sir tom dick or harry
youre captain torrance or admiral
togo or anything else you say to me
just as long as you please some folks
havent any tact in these things but
between us captain wre know that there
wont be no trouble about walking in
with those little articles and there aint
any favors you cant ask of me after
that

  the englishman sighed wearily
well mr rider he said i think its
uncommon nasty of you to force me
into a thing of this sort but i fancy its
my fault all the way i shouldnt have
yielded to the first request my word
think what would happen if the thing
should become known theyd have
cartoons of me in the comic papers y
know i say it would never do would
it  id look such a perfectly bally ass
but give me your packet mr rider
and lets have done with the stupid
business and pray dont tell me again

whats in it its no end unpleasant to
think im making a smuggler of my-
self 

  come on down to my stateroom and
well get the things said the man from
chicago with vast satisfaction ive
got a lot of those cigars if you like em
moren i -can smoke in six months
give you all youll carry

  captain torrance raised a deprecating
hand and a look of pain shot into his
large eyes but the american was al-
ready hurrying down the deck and he
followed hesitatingly protest expressed
in his walk and every line of his distin-
guished figure

  a moment later two other passen-
gers met in the spot just vacated the
indifferent traveler no longer confined
to a steamer chair but still regarding
the rising and sinking horizon line as
a factor in life and the ubiquitous mr
warren of taunton-the ebullient mr
warren

  the former would have been content
to pass with a nod but the taunton man
wouldnt have it so he stopped and
fetched his victim a cheery clap on the
back-an unwarranted liberty even un-
der normal conditions-and said with
the sibilant monotone of a conspirator

  oh whats the use the thing is
too much of a pipe ive got evidence
enough to hang the man if traveling
incognito was a capital offense i got
hold of the valet like i told you i would
and it was too easy the tip i slipped
him wasnt even necessary

  the valet then admitted the soft im-
peachment without parley suggested
the other with his habitual weariness
of manner

  he was a wise one he didnt have
a word to say related warren but if
a grin a foot wide can tell anything
why i got the whole story  i asked im
a bunch of questions about his master
and he just about admitted everything
i sprung on him without really saying
a word

  well im very glad for your sake
said the other it eases your mind
doesnt it you may now regard the
voyage as scarcely a failure in point of
interest i thought you were satisfied


top-notch magazine

as to tfie mans identity when he ac-
cepted the little matter you put up to
him wasnt that enough 

  sure agreed mr warren but
this business with the valet was just to
make doubly certain i knew well
enough all right but i wanted to nail
it hard-just like getting a check certi-
fied see

  the indifferent traveler saw but
he terminated the conversation with a
sudden wave of his hand and walked
away with very measured tread the
vagaries of the horizon line were again
claiming his attention

  the taunton man caught sight of a
passenger with whom free and open con-
versation had previously been denied
him by circumstances and he hastened
to make fair use of the opportunity

chapter iv

forfeits and consequences

that evening there was an im-
promptu musicale in the saloon
and to the agreeable surprise of the
mixed company captain torrance ad-
mitted a certain familiarity with music
and was finally prevailed upon to ren-
der two or three vocal numbers

  his selections were typical of the brit-
ish amateur baritone he gave the old
english gallants with the gusto of a
beefeater and a couple of familiar
gilbert and sullivan airs which are
rarely omitted from any drawing-room
repertoire

  a spontaneous flutter of applause re-
warded his efforts and left him flushed
with naive embarrassment

  i read in some american magazine
that the new british ambassador was not
unknown as a more than average musi-
cian remarked mrs chiltern a chic
and agreeable little widow from cleve-
land

 a chorus of ohs and ahs
greeted her sally but instead of mak-
ing the singer more flustered they
seemed to aid him in recovering his
habitual nonchalance

  by jove really now he ex-
claimed then i am again flattered by
learning of something else i have in

common with this sir percy vande-
leur

  from all weve learned of your com-
mon attributes captain torrance you
and sir percy must come deucedly near
being doubles said the indifferent pas-
senger who had previously maintained
a consistent silence he probably awak-
ened at that moment to the comfortable
fact that the sky line was not visible
from the saloon

  captain torrance laughed good-hu-
moredly ah you must all have your
little jokes he jsaid but really you
know for a shipboard joke this has
gone rather further than any i ever had
the honor of being involved in its
gone quite deucedly far theres no such
thing as ignoring it you know i only
hope that sir percy wherever the chap
may be would feel half as flattered as i
do quite an experience to be taken
for a first-class ambassador when youre
only a bally half-pay soldier man you
know

  im curious to know put in a bos-
ton man of serious aspect if an ex-
army man who becomes a member of
the diplomatic corps still retains his
status with the war office

  just what i was wondering myself
quickly seconded mr warren of taun-
ton how is that captain torrance
a retired captains pay wouldnt cut
much figure alongside the salary of an
ambassador would it

  for an instant absolute silence per-
vaded the saloon the company waited
in breathless expectancy

  then captain torrance laughed easi-
ly you rather have methere he ex-
claimed  and a burst of gratified laugh-
ter fluttered over the room but it was
silenced as the captain added you
see i never happened to look into the
matter of what the diplomat chaps get
it takes all my time to plan how a beg-
gar of a captain can get on with a cap-
tains pay

  the indifferent traveler once more
added his voice to the cause you seem
to forget good people he remarked
ironically that a gentleman qualified
to hold a ministers portfolio is logically
not a novice in a little matter of polite
by courtesy of the port



repartee i dare say too that ex-army
men are not unskilled in the delicate art
of evasion and casuistry

  some of the passengers looked at
captain torrance for a possible show of
resentment but he was good humor it-
self

  i say he cried jocularly this isnt
a bad way of passing an evening is it
even if one is the-er-what you call
in america-the goat  it beats for-
feits you know and consequences
and all that sort of thing and one cant
play bridge all the time can one 

  for that matter might not for-
feits be involved queried the indif-
ferent traveler dryly with something
more than his usual spirit and might
there not be consequences as well
thats interesting said the boston
man brightly that opens a new line
of thought just where is the applica-
tion sir

  it was merely a passing fancy
sighed the indifferent traveler almost
regretfully i fear i couldnt expand
it very much in my present mental
state why do they have such blasted
pounding engines in a modern ocean
liner like this they shake up a man
to the very soul

  the others laughed politely and cast
sympathetic glances at the undoubted
sufferer

  captain torrance seemed not unwill-
ing to follow up the neglected line of
thought

  life is really a continuous game of
forfeits and consequences isnt it  he
suggested sometimes you know the
chap that pays the forfeits most of the
time doesnt seem to realize it and those
that never da pay are the grumblers
as for the consequences who shall say
how or when they may fall

  the boston man was disposed to take
up the question philosophically and he
was ardently seconded by a german
traveler of argumentative tendencies
but the evening had waxed and waned
and the people were weary

  a woman bade good night to the
people about her and left the saloon
and her departure was the signal for a
general dispersal

  a young debutante with more cour-
age than discretion paused in the door-
way and drew attention to herself with
a swish of the train of her evening
gown

  i met all sorts of diplomats and ce-
lebrities on the continent she an-
nounced in a high soprano tone but i
really think sir percy vandeleur is the
cleverest of them all

  a roar of doubtful appreciation
greeted the shot and all eyes were
turned on the captain

  he smiled in his calm unruffled way
and made a low and courtly bow

  my dear young lady he said suave-
ly i must acknowledge the frank com-
pliment for my countryman if it is
ever my pleasure and honor to meet sir
percy vandeleur i assure you i shall
not fail to apprise him of the honor that
has been done him this evening

chapter v

not to be denied

it was the last day at sea and while
the passengers watched eagerly for
the first sight of land many little con-
fidences and courtesies were exchanged
by the chance acquaintances of the brief
but traditionally intimate period of the
voyage who were in most cases prob-
ably destined never to cross each others
track again

  captain torrance met the little widow
from cleveland on deck and they
walked together for a time

  mrs chiltern was vivacious and
charming as usual but she seemed to
have something on her mind

  at last she said hesitatingly and with
awkward confusion

  i hate dreadfully to say what i am
going to say captain torrance but
mr warren-you know him-says that

you are such a kind obliging man-

  ah mr warren exclaimed the
captain with something like harshness
yes yes i have reason to know him
very well and what has he been tell-
ing you mrs chiltern

  he said only the kindest loveliest
things about you asserted the little
woman and im going to be very


top-notch magazine

frank captain torrance and i hope
you wont think too harshly of my te-
merity im a very poor woman cap-
tain although i have been traveling in
europe its the first time i ever went
abroad you know and i had such a
good time but dear me it has taken
just about all the money i had to live
on for a year

  and this is what i want to tell you
she continued i did all sorts of fool-
ish extravagant things while i was over
there but i thought i might never go
again i bought myself a be-utiful set
of russian sables and captain tor-
rance i have scarcely money enough to
get them through the customs ill be
simply strapped as we say in the states
by the time i get to cleveland

  mr warren says she went on
breathlessly that you have the courtesy
of the port-the right to take in any-
thing you please without any trouble of
any sort and he says youre awfully
good-natured about doing little favors
for people he made me promise not to
tell any one he told me but i was so
tempted to ask you if you-if you just
could get my sables through for me it
ould mean so much to me i know i
had no right to be so extravagant but
you-

  the high-bred face of the englishman
took on a look of lofty pain and regret

  in the first place my dear mrs chil-
tern he said kindly i must take the
liberty of saying that this mr warren
is an unmitigated ass whatever trans-
action i have had with him cannot be
discussed now i was indiscreet enough
to consent to do him a favor and i re-
gret it

  you have my deepest sympathy
madam he continued in what you
properly regard as your extravagant
misfortune but if you will consider all
conditions you will see how helpless i
am to do anything for you my own
financial condition would not warrant
me in doing anything to aid you even
if your pride would permit such a thing
and i wish you could see mrs chiltern
that as a good american you cannot
for your consciences sake deliberately
cheat your country of its just due i

know for a fact that some of the heavi-
est smuggling is done by pretty women
who have all the other virtues that we
respect but i deplore it sorely madam
good women should give more serious
thought to such things then they would
come nearer to the standards we have
built up around them

  the little widow was astonished and
dismayed but he said it would cost
you nothing and be no trouble to you
she protested weakly an ambassa-
dor has a perfect right to do such
things hasnt he mr warren said
so

  no an ambassador has certainly
not a right to do such things declared
the englishman firmly and pray
what has an ambassador to do with this
matter anyway

  everybody knows youre sir percy
vandeleur  the lady insisted with fem-
inine desperation you cannot deny
it

  ah but i can deny it and i do
returned the captain  i am captain
torrance late of the british army and
no one aboard this ship has the right to
address me by any other term

  the lady from cleveland drew her-
self up with more pride than her dimin-
utive stature would warrant

  i am very sorry captain torrance
that i was silly enough to annoy you in
this manner she said very bitterly
t assure you i shall never do such a
thing again and she flounced away
doubtless to find one warren from
taunton massachusetts

  scarcely had she disappeared when
the englishman was intercepted by an-
other fellow passenger this time it
was a small quiet man who had hith-
erto been uncommunicative and inof-
fensive

  he took but little time to get at the
matter which was on his mind im
henry h ripley of new york he
said in a businesslike tone i guess
youve heard of me

  really i cant say i have but thats
my misfortune replied torrance

  ive got a little matter to put up to
you continued the man without hesi-
tancy a man named warren has let
by courtesy of the port



it slip in conversation with me that
you are taking a few-well a few ar-
ticles of value through the customs for

him and another man-

  warren cried torrance harshly
by jove i cant abide the beastly way
that fellow is behaving

  never mind that said mr ripley
im going to talk business sir and ill
be brief im a collector of rare curios
and antiques im pretty well known
and i cant afford to take any ordinary
chances but when i see a chance to
slip anything into the country with a
little additional profit im not the one to
let it go by me

  now ive got a little casket of an-
tique jewels that stands me about fif-
teen thousand as it is theyre mostly
pearls rubies and emeralds in antique
settings you can take them in as fam-
ily trinkets and not a word will be said
im not forcing you to do this as a
favor i intend to make it right with
you i can afford to pay a little for get-
ting the things in without all that duty
youre not forcing me exclaimed
the englishman now my good man
what do you mean by that 

  i mean that im talking business
right from the shoulder said ripley
frankly youre in danger of standing
in with your government and the united
states government pretty wrong sir
percy i guess you know about what
would happen if i granted a little inter-
view to a few newspaper men at the
dock when we land it would make in-
teresting reading-how the new british
ambassador was starting out in his ca-
reer as a smuggler of jewelry and such
stuff on the strength of his official priv-
ileges 

  for a moment the eyes of captain
torrance seemed to shoot fire and rip-
ley quailed for an instant but only to
return to the attack with fresh vigor

  theres not much time left he said
pointedly youd better make up your
mind my friend you see i can use the
wireless to tell the reporters ive got a
story for them and the customs men
will be ready to have something to say
too

  torrance laughed suddenly youre

too clever by half my friend he said
witheringly it seems that i have made
mistakes in trying to be a good fellow
very well i never play at hazards with
men of your stamp it doesnt pay
give me your jewel casket and when
i return it to you i shall require a lit-
tle document that will exonerate me and
release me from further complicity in
the transactions of you and this fellow
warren

  thatif fair enough agreed the man
and heres the casket i dont need
any receipt the british ambassador
cant get away very easily

  torrance laughed dryly as he took a
package which the man drew from the
pocket of his overcoat

  i tell you as i have told the others
that i am merely captain torrance of
the retired list i can say no more he
remarked

  have your little joke if you will
returned ripley im satisfied with the
deal as it lays

chapter vi

an audience

quarantine the laurcntic wras
boarded by customs officers and
the usual printed forms were distributed
among the passengers for the declara-
tion of dutiable articles

  a little later as the ship was steaming
up the bay mr hiram rider of chi-
cago came speeding along the deck to
where mr warren of taunton was
standing complacently viewing the new
york sky line

  say warren he cried excitedly
laying his hands on the latters shoul-
ders  what do ythink  that man the
ambassador isnt doing a thing but de-
claring your pearls and my diamonds
and a lot of other truck what does
he mean by it-thats what i want to
know 

  mr warren laughed heartily and con-
temptuously

  calm right down mr rider he
said soothingly just use a little rea-
son thats the very thing captain
torrance would naturally do he aint
supposed to be the british ambassador


top-notch magazine

till he gets ashore is he well what
would he do but declare all the truck
hes got and then when he gets ashore
show his credentials as they call em
and tell the inspectors who he is  hell
get the formalities over as quick as he
can and then hell probably go right
up to the hotel acropolis and well all
pay him a little social farewell visit
see 

  mr rider apparently saw and
after a moment of reflection hnodded
comprehendingly and returned to the
saloon

  the great vessel was warped into her
dock without delay and the passengers
said their final good-bys and went their
various ways through the mazes of the
customs department

  several interested persons noticed
with satisfaction that captain torrance
was treated with something more than
ordinary courtesy by the inspectors and
that he was one of the first to leave and
take a waiting taxicab

  a few minutes later another cab de-
parted into the city bearing the con-
tented and smiling mr warren of
taunton

  two other passengers messrs rider
and ripley later joined forces and went
to a telephone office in the neighbor-
hood of the wharf

  mr rider acted as spokesman and
phoned to the hotel acropolis to ask
if the british ambassador were putting
up there mr ripley stood by and lis-
tened to the conversation eagerly

  presently rider hung up the receiver
and turned to his companion with a glad
smile lighting up his countenance

  everything is o k he announced
gayly the hotel operator says sir
percy vandeleur has just arrived-that
he came in on the laurentic-so thats
all straight she says his suite got there
two days ago and the whole outfit starts
for washington to-morrow now mr
ripley well pay a call on our friend
the british ambassador in about an
hour like as not well meet warren
up there

  in the state suite of the hotel acrop-
olis the honorable harold mostyn pri-

vate secretary to sir percy vandeleur
came into the latters presence and
handed him five calling cards

  you must be very tired sir percy
he said sympathetically i dare say
youll scarcely care to see these people
to-day  they say-that is one of them
a mr rider says that you met them
on shipboard and that you are expect-
ing them

  the british ambassador laughed
whimsically

  i am a bit tired harold he ad-
mitted but ill see these people as
a matter of fact i was expecting them
ten minutes later the five visitorf
were ushered into an anteroom of thu
suite

  messrs rider and ripley had regard-
ed the other three with some wonder-
ment they merely recognized them as
fellow voyagers on the laurentic but
remembered them only vaguely

  i didnt see much of those fellows
on the ship ripley whispered to his
companion but by george  they must
have got next to the ambassador too
a door opened and a servant of the
ambassadors retinue stepped in ajid an-
nounced formally

  his excellency the ambassador will
see you in here gentlemen

  the five americans got up shuffled
a little and then filed into the room in-
dicated with some nervousness it was
one thing to hobnob with nobility on a
promenade deck and another to meet
that same nobility in official state

  the room which they entered was a
large one richly furnished for small re-
ceptions and like functions

  a spare man of medium height clad
in a black morning suit arose from a
chair near a large table and advanced
to meet the visitors

  i am very glad to see you again
gentlemen he said with simple cour-
tesy i fear i was not always sociable
on shipboard but you will make allow-
ances i trust you see i was wretch-
edly troubled with the beastly rolling of
the ship that was really about all i
could think of

  the manner of the distinguished man
by courtesy of the port



was elegance itself and his courtesy was
beyond reproach but the five visitors
stood silent as if turned to stone

mr ripley was the first to find voice
say he muttered hoarsely
if youre sir percy vandeleur who in
the name of sam hill was that captain
torrance and where is he

  the ambassador continued to smile
i was expecting this visit gentlemen
he said calmly because i couldnt very
well avoid hearing what was going on
during the voyage i havent the ghost
of an idea who your friend captain
torrance is but i might venture a guess
as to what he is

  a miserable low swindling hound
-thats what he is without a doubt
shouted mr rider and im stung
good and plenty

  i gave that man five thousand dol-
lars worth of stuff to get in for me
howled one of the three strangers

  the other two claimed losses of two
thousand and eight thousand respec-
tively

  well perhaps youll allow me to
ask remarked mr ripley witheringly
what you as british ambassador was
doing all the time if you knew that
shark was doing us up brown

  i had utterly nothing to do with the
matter returned the ambassador i
was not well and my chief concern was
to preserve my incognito i confess i
derived not a little amusement from the
antics of you gentlemen and a few oth-
ers it occurs to me now that this
captain torrance behaved quite as cred-
itably as any one on board i paid lit-
tle attention to the details of things go-
ing on around me but i could easily see
that a number of you were making
strenuous endeavors to elude the cus-
toms authorities of your country
whether you succeeded or not was of
little moment to me i noticed that
captain torrance repeatedly denied that
he was the british ambassador-surely
he could do no more it looks to me
gentlemen as if your case were best
illustrated by the old saying hoist
with his own petard 

wheres warren that man from
taunton massachusetts demanded

rider as though the ambassador might
be hiding him

  i dare say the man that called him-
self by that name is now speeding away
from new york with his friend cap-
tain torrance answered vandeleur
even with my indifference to the case
it was not hard for me to see that the
two men were something more than
chance acquaintances and the ameri-
can men of the shoe industry whom i
have met have been scarcely of mr
warrens type

  well what can we do demanded
rider dejectedly

  wthy its hardly a matter for the
state department and nothing of an in-
ternational affair said the ambassador
so i dont see that i am called upon to
take action officially i may say that i
mentioned the little affair to my friend
the consul general who was here a lit-
tle while ago he said he would re-
port it to the police

  thats all you gentlemen can do i
fancy he continued but you will
have to treat the case rather delicately
with regard to your own parts in it will
you not you see you are all smug-
glers virtually while this torrance
chap paid the duty on all your things
without effort to evade it he is doubt-
less a member of a far-reaching gang of
swindlers they figured that more
money could be made by obtaining
jewels in that manner and paying the
regular duty on them than by ordinary
smuggling they must have had a con-
siderable capital to meet the demand
but you see the thing was practically
safe for them

  i cant see that-not on the face of
it declared ripley

  mr warren made it safe explained
vandeleur he was the lookout i
have little doubt that he knew me and
played me very craftily he managed
to keep me in a mood to see the affair
as a joke and he watched me closely
enough to see that i made no move to-
ward exposure had i done so tor-
rance would have given back your
jewels and apologized for his little
practical joke he had a decided knack
for carrying out the part of a rather


top-notch magazine

naive tourist you must credit him with
that

  i am going to see a lawyer first
said ripley and started for the door
without ceremony

  the four others followed muttering
vaguely and clasping and unclasping
their nervous hands

  they had enjoyed an audience with
one of the most distinguished diplomats
of the day but they wrere hardly appre-
ciative and not a word of farewell was
spoken

  a few hours later in the evening
the british ambassador took a short au-
tomobile ride with his secretary to see
the famous lighter-than-day avenue of
the big city as he was leaving for wash-
ing on the following morning

  on their return he hurried through
the hotel corridors toward his rooms
but chanced to meet one of his fellow
passengers of the lanrentic face to face
it was the little widow from cleveland
mrs chiltern who was staying there
overnight with friends before starting
for ohio

  she recognized him as the quiet in-
different passenger she had spoken with
once or twice in the saloon but wrhom
she had not once heard called by name
and she nodded and gave him a cordial
good evening

  i understand the british ambassador
is staying here too she said casually
as they both stood waiting for an ele-
vator

  the ambassador smiled whimsically
i am having that pleasure he laughed

  you she exclaimed aghast

  i am sailing under my true colors
now mrs chiltern he explained
for reasons of my own ipreferred to
preserve my incognito while aboard
ship

  the woman was speechless for a mo-
ment but-why-who was that man
that called himself captain torrance

she asked presently in a hoarse almost
incredulous voice

  sir percy laughed we have no rea-
son to suppose he was not captain tor-
rance as he claimed he answered
some people who were on the ship
called here this afternoon and were
quite as astonished as you are i be-
lieve they were so thoroughly convinced
aboard ship that captain torrance was
the british ambassador that they-well
i think they virtually forced the oblig-
ing captain to bring in certain dutiable
articles of theirs which the man did
after a fashion of his own choosing its
a peculiar case mrs chiltern

  the widow was thunderstruck and
she was thoughtfully silent as they en-
tered the elevator and it started for the
upper floors

  i too was persuaded to ask him to
do me a little favor she said sud-
denly with a flush of confusion but
he refused to do anything of the sort
to herself she added i wonder why
i get out here said the ambassa-
dor as the elevator stopped at his floor
i am glad to hear what you say
madam i am glad the chap refused
you he had the manners of a gentle-
man and if he was a swindler as they
claim i am rather pleased to hear that
he had still something of gallantry in his
make-up good night mrs chiltern
sir percy vandeleur turned to his
secretary as they gained the state suite
and smiled a little wearily early
breakfast in the morning harold he
said and then well be off i fancy
those visitors this afternoon found me
rather poor company-even little mrs
chiltern didnt seem particularly im-
pressed with me just now rather think
shes more interested in captain tor-
rance for example if i am not more
of a success with the americans i meet
in washington we shall shortly be book-
ing passage for our return eh what

editor of top-notch magazine 

  a series of dreams which i had last spring
and an incident which followed them may be
put down by some to the common explana-
tion of coincidence but such an explanation
does not satisfy me

  i dreamed one night that i saw an owl sit-
ting upon the footboard of my bed it was
not like the owls i had seen in museums or
bird stores but of a peculiar coloring of yel-
lowish white flecked with gray i thought
little of the dream until it came again and
then i mentioned facetiously to my family
that the bird of wisdom had visited me
twice during sleep

  my wife who has the superstitious nature
of some women was disposed to feel some
anxiety but i treated the matter lightly
several wreeks passed and i thought nothing
more of the matter but the owl came again
and i saw it three times within the space of
a week just before i started with my family
for a little sojourn in the catskills i said
nothing about it preferring my own reflec-
tions to those of a nervous woman

  we had been at one of the large hotels in
the catskills about a week when i took my
wife driving one morning in a livery-stable

a

rig we were driving along a quiet mountain
road through woods when my wife cried
out oh look at that

  and there on the limb of a tree about a
hundred feet from the road sat my yellow-
and-vvhite-and-gray owl blinking at us al-
most at the instant of my looking at it it
spread its wings and flapped clumsily away
into the deeper woods owls of course
with their peculiar faculty for night vision
do not see well in daylight and the birds
progress was slow and labored but it was
almost immediately out of sight among the
dense foliage

  hold on i said im going to see that
fellow again-thats my owl

  i	jumped out of the buggy and ran after
the bird fighting my way through the thick
scrub my wife unwilling to sit there alone
behind a strange horse got out and waited
for me by the roadside

  suddenly i was called backvjjy her cries of
alarm i ran as fast as i courl but only ar-
rived in time to see our stable rig disappear-
ing in a cloud of dust down the road my
wife said the horse had been seized with
some kind of a fit and after shaking all over
for a minute had bolted we found the
poor brute dead with a broken neck at the
bottom of a deep ravine the buggy was
smashed into matchwood had we been
seated in the buggy i dislike to think what
our fate would have been

  a number of people at the hotel said that
my description of the owl plainly showed it
to be of the not uncommon variety known as
the barn owl the fact remains however
that i had never seen a bird of that descrip-
tion until it appeared in my dreams and the
owl on the tree was the living image of the
dream bird theres the story take it as you
will	john e evans

the parachutes

he hurricane after blowing
for five long days had de-
creased until it was nothing
more than a stiff gale the
seas however still were run-
ning uncomfortably high and with her
engines turning only enough to keep
her sharp nose into them the arrow
labored heavily

  bob braybrooke who with his friend
and partner jimmy tyrone owned the
great armed yacht was clawing his way
aft by the help of a handrail on one of
the deck houses to this rail there also
clung a large broad-shouldered young
man donald brandreth whose curly
yellow head was thrown back while its
owner gazed earnestly into the sky

  say old chap didnt you hear an
odd sort of popping noise  he shouted
at the top of his voice as the other
touched him in passing

yes i did bellowed braybrooke

  then the both laughed during the
hurricane they had been obliged to shout
to be heard above the shrieking wind
and now if they did not stop to think
the habit remained

  i heard it too said jimmy tyrone
who had just come down from the
bridge where do you think it came
from brandy

  it seemed to come from above us
somewhere replied donald brandreth
-or dandj brandy as he was more
commonly known to his myriad friends
in nearly all parts of the world civilized
and otherwise

  and look he went on pointing
see those things jolly queer i call
it eh

  the other two gazed in the direction
indicated by brandreths finger

  through the air some almost out of
sight some lower but nearly all well up
a lot of red patches-brilliantly crim-
son-came sailing through the air first
in ones and twos then in flocks

  even as the three men looked from
under one of these patches there came
a puff of pearl-colored vapor which
almost instantly dissolved and a second
or two later there followed one of the
pops mentioned by brandreth then
another patch apparently filled with a
spirit of emulation gave two pops

  what on earth can they be asked
bob wonderingly of no one in particu-
lar were some distance away from
coney island and its pyrotechnics if i
mistake not

  they were indeed some distance away
from the spot named in fact they
were well south of the equator but
braybrooke received an answer to his
question with unexpected suddenness
brandreths rosy face turned white and
the tricolored sins



grasping him and jimmy each by their
collars he whisked them to one side as
though they had been children

  the beastly things are parachutes
he cried here comes one-and its
fizzing like a siphon

  hardly had he spoken when the para-
chute flying only a little above the
waves was upon them fizzing as the
young man had said a slant of wind
took it hurling it over so that the crim-
son cloth started to pass on one side of
the foremast on which was set a storm
trysail its sputtering burden on the
other

  tyrone started to spring forward
braybrooke jumped to intercept him
before either could act the fizzing
ended in a resounding explosion try-
sail and parachute vanished together as
the flame of a candle vanishes when
blown out a packet enveloped in oil-
skin which the latter had carried fell
upon the deck and was whisked aft by
the wind braybrooke put out his foot
as it passed and stopped it

  snatching it up brandreth gingerly
examined the thing pinching it until its
softness assured him that no more ex-
plosive was stored within

  seems safe enough now he haz-
arded

  safe snorted tyrone well there
are lots of its little friends around here
that arent safe the firmament is
choked with em

  oh willis he continued hailing
the bridge have the remainder of that
trysail cleared away-if there is any re-
mainder-and at the same time get out
of this well have aeroplanes and dir-
igibles running afoul of us next

  lets go below and find out if we
can what it all means suggested bob
braybrooke as the officer to whom his
friend had shouted waved a hand in
token that the order was understood

  right-o assented brandreth and
followed by the other two he went
through the companion way and into the
cabin

  brandys fingers shook a little as he
opened a penknife and ripped off the
outer waterproof covering of the mys-
terious packet this was not at all the

sort of thing that one would suspect of
this apparently nerveless young man
the others looked at him in astonish-
ment he saw those looks

  you see ive sort of a hunch as you
yankees would say that these things
come from-from those whom im try-
ing to find he explained rather apolo-
getically

  you mean from professor wedge-
wood asked bob

  it looks like the sort of thing hed
do assented brandreth ripping off
cover after cover and strewing them
over the cabin table

  is the professor given to practical
jokes inquired tyrone sarcastically
that bundle was as large as a big
tomato can now its about the size of
a sausage

  no replied the one addressed
therell be something inside probably
yes here it is

  he ripped off a voluminous piece of
oilskin as he spoke and held up a sheet
of handsome note paper tightly rolled
opening it he glanced at the contents
then tossed the sheet over to his com-
panions

  i was right you see he said

  bob read the message aloud

  having been wrecked with the schooner
aloha on this island i send forth these
fire balloons made of cloth intended for
use in trading with the natives and propelled
by a mixture of resin and explosive powder
taken from signal rockets which were carried
by the schooner in order to call attention to
the plight of many records of a value to the
scientific world which cannot be estimated
and which together with much luggage is
here on this coral atoll

  three islanders composing the crew at-
tempted to swim to the shore and were
drowned before reaching it and my daughter
and i alone survive

  why hang it all theres no signa-
ture  cried braybrooke as he finished

  none is needed replied brandreth
with some bitterness that note in
two sentences rating winifred-his
daughter-as of less consequence than
those beastly records of his would have
told me who wrote the note even if the
handwriting didnt but he doesnt say
where the island is its like him to
leave that out


top-notch magazine

  its got to be dead to windward
cant be anywhere else said tyrone re-
assuringly wait a shake you fellows
-ill be back in a second

  he left the cabin with a painful
embarrassment-for what he had to say
savored of sentiment which always is
embarrassing to an anglo-saxon-
brandreth after two or three abortive
attempts addressed braybroke

  its awfully decent of you two chaps
to take me with you as you have he
said you were right when you told
me that id be more likely to find win-
nie by going with you than if i went
straggling about over the ocean myself
its right-down bully of you 

  oh shut up brandy replied bray-
brooke also embarrassed chuck that
rot wont you 

  and so the thanks were spoken and
understood tyrone entering the cabin
at that moment announced 

  the winds falling fast now sos the
sea those red parachutes are still go-
ing strong and popping like a chinese
new year but were well out of their
path

  did you see any signs of that
island  asked his partner

  i suppose so theres a smudge of
something dipping on the horizon we
probably will know for certain before
sundown at our present gait where
has my pipe got to 

  finding it in his pocket he filled and
lighted it and then a silence fell over
them all they were old friends these
three-as also was willis now in charge
on the bridge

chapter ii

symbols of sin

americans-and good americans
-as they were braybrooke and
tyrone had been sent to school in eng-
land before the former returned to enter
west point and the latter annapolis
donald brandreth the only son of a
great canadian landowner had been a
schoolmate and chum of whom they
afterward had lost sight until they ran
across him on the isthmus on their way
south

  brandreth had been trying to charter
a schooner in order to go in pursuit of
winifred wedgewood who had been
taken by her father presumably on one
of his erratic scientific expeditions
which might lead him anywhere before
it was finished

  the arrotv had been to the united
states in order to leave there for the
winter the young wives of her owners
and now was on her leisurely way back
to their great central american planta-
tion the arrowhead by way of the
isle of pearls which they also owned

  well arent you the fine young
bunch  called willis as he came into
the cabin the three already there
started up rubbing their eyes the
lowering sea had rocked them to sleep
there had been little rest during the
hurricane

  you neednt talk-you had the last
sleep growled tyrone good-naturedly

  not now laughed willis any-
how weve arrived and will let go an
anchor directly weve struck the right
island fast enough-theres a red
streamer flying from one of those coco-
nut trees that must be fifty feet long
they needed no second summons but
tumbled on deck as an anchor was
dropped almost at the same moment a
boat slapped the water and into it the
three men tumbled the crew of clas-
onvacas-a tribe of one powerful in-
dians now owning allegiance to the ar-
rowhead and trained by its owners-
gave way with a will and the boat went
shooting toward the atolls sheltered en-
trance 

  -rusalem exclaimed braybrooke
under his breath

  for the love of mike sighed his
partner robinson crusoe-up to
date

  shut up cant you growled bran-
dreth he never did think of the
suitability of things-the professor is
beyond that

  evidently the professor was rarely
before have a top hat and frock coat
been seen on an uninhabited tropical
island-never perhaps when coupled
with white canvas shoes and a long
mercurial barometer slung riflewise
the tricolored sins



with its end protruding over a shoulder
and a heavy canvas-wrapped bundle
carried as one might carry a child but
the professor was quite unembarrassed

  ah donald he said as though he
had parted from that individual but an
hour before these two gentlemen are
friends of yours i suppose gentle-
men i hold in my arms the records of
which i wrote in my notes one of which
you evidently have received these rec-
ords of course must be safeguarded at
all hazards you will therefore be good
enough to put me on board your vessel
at once afterward you can return for
the other and less important things

  wheres winnie demanded don-
ald brandreth partially stifling an im-
precation

  where she would naturally be
guarding the remaining things-together
with envy hatred and malice

  few things in those islands are
strange enough to excite much curiosity
but professor wedgewood was one
and the notion of a young girl being set
to guard three of the cardinal sins an-
other

  there was no time then to make in-
quiries however brandreth started off
at a run in the direction which the pro-
fessor had indicated by a backward toss
of his head and with a word to the
clasonvaca coxswain bidding him to
hold the boat until their return the other
two followed

  on an enormous pile of luggage sat
the girl dressed in a blue yachting suit
her gentle face showing the traces of re-
cent tears and still full of apprehen-
sion but that face lighted up wonder-
fully as young brandreths stalwart
form appeared it was not until then
that his two companions saw how beau-
tiful it really was like the gentlemen
they were both pulled up short

  get down to the boat as soon as you
can brandy tyrone called

  they they returned to the beach
those two were very long in coming

  the professor was fuming in what
was evidently an agony of apprehension
as he tramped nervously up and down
the coral sand he wished to be set on
board at once and made his wishes very

plain indeed he seemed to think-
which indeed was the case-that the
importance of those records of his quite
justified all such demands and became
haughtily reserved when the two young
men refused to leave until the others ar-
rived

  he thawed not at all even when they
reached the arrow and the precious rec-
ords together with another package of
like size and even greater weight were
safely deposited in her currency vault
and winifred in the best stateroom his
apprehension became greater and
greater with growing disfavor his two
hosts regarded him for a time the
professor contained himself but soon
reached a point where he could contain
himself no longer

  why is this anchor not raised he
demanded

  because the boat that was sent
ashore for your stuff hasnt returned
replied braybrooke politely and why
if i may ask are your coat tails on
fire

  without the slightest appearance of
surprise professor wedgewood exam-
ined the dangling tails of his frock coat
which were smoking and beginning to
burst into flame

  ah i see he replied gravely in
sending out the parachutes i inclosed
the fuses of the explosive which i sent
with them in wet paper rubbed with
stick phosphorous when dried it would
automatically ignite i must thought-
lessly have placed some of it in the
pocket of my coat evidently it has
dried

  evidently it had the two young men
could not help laughing and the profes-
sor permitted himself a doubtful smile
in sympathy

  while speaking he was emptying the
pockets of his coat so far as the fire
allowed then he unslung the barom-
eter and afterward taking off the coat
flung it overboard

  at that moment the cable began to
grind its way inboard for the boat was
returning and was hoisted in as the ar-
row got under way without invitation
professor wedgewood climbed to the
bridge far away on the path which


top-notch magazine

they were following was the smoke of
a steamer he pointed to it with a trem-
bling finger

  a war vessel he asked huskily
of paisamaril

  possibly replied braybrooke who
with tyrone had followed him
why

  the professor leaned weakly against
the bridge rail all strength seemed to
have left his legs and his face was pasty
white

  dont let it overtake us he begged
dont-pray dont take any chances
before you permit that it would be
fatal-fatal

  why  asked braybrooke again
but he was touched nevertheless by the
old mans distress

  what seems to be wrong he asked
solicitously

  the tricolored sins murmured the
older man absently

  the vohat demanded jimmy

  with an effort the professor pulled
himself together

  of course you cannot understand
he said i will show you to what i re-
ferred that will save many words
come

  they followed him as he led the way
below to the door of the strong room
and signified his wish that it should be
opened twirling the combination
jimmy swung the door wide taking
one of his two packages the professor
carried it to the cabin table and un-
folded its canvas wrapping

  tossing this aside he revealed a great
silver casket its lid heavily chased
with a semibarbaric design contained
five great opaque stones respectively
red yellow blue green and black tak-
ing from his pocket a strangely shaped
key the professor unlocked the lid and
threw it open inside from nests of
white silk three jewels blazed and
winked in the electric lights

  blue-white blood-red and the most
vivid living green they were diamond
ruby and emerald each as large as an
english walnut

  the tricolored sins said the pro-
fessor simply they were named in

the land whence they came-and rightly
named-envy hatred and malice

  for a time the young men hung over
the casket without speaking of pearls
they were rather good judges but of
brilliants they knew practically nothing
yet they could not but see that stones
such as these must be of a value almost
incalculable reverently they replaced
them in their nests

  what does it all mean  asked bray-
brooke where was it that they came
from

  from the east said the professor
and he spoke rather as one who thinks
aloud than as though replying to a ques-
tion  many many centuries ago when
the race which found and cut them was
pushed across the sea by an enemy
which pursued but could not conquer
it to take final refuge in some of these
islands

  but how did you get hold of them
and why did you bring them here
persisted tyrone as the older man
paused

  collecting and arranging the record
of that great migration has been my
lifes work the professor continued
it was through these records that i first
heard of the jewels and afterward
found them how does not now mat-
ter what does signify is that others
know of their existence of the fact that
i have found them and that these others
wish to take them from me

  so thats the reason that you feared
a paisamarilleno man-o-war said
jimmy tyrone i understand now
you neednt be afraid though theres
nothing in these seas that can catch the
arrow

  i wouldnt make too sure of that-as
things stand said willis coming into
the cabin but halting at the doorway
come on deck and have a look things
seem rather queer to me

chapter iii

in action

otopping only long enough to close
the casket and replace it in the
strong room they returned to the deck
there was no need of going higher to
the tricolored sins



see the steamer whose smoke they had
descried upon leaving the atoll her
gray hull with its sponsons now was
plainly visible with all her speed she
was rushing toward the end of a chan-
nel between coral reefs along which the
arrow was passing

  we can put about if you like and
get out from among these reefs by an-
other way said willis by doing that
wed leave that ship simply nowhere
what do you say 

  no said braybrooke decidedly
nothing doing

  id see her jolly well blowed before
id get out of her way-if i had any
say in the matter remarked brandreth
strolling up to them

  call the crew to quarters com-
manded tyrone his jaw setting she
may lick us if she wants to fight-she
carries heavier guns than we do-but
shell have the time of her fair young
life while shes doing it

  willis grinned appreciatively the call
was sounded and the dusky barefooted
crew-which didnt lack very much for
that matter of being bare all over-ran
noiselessly and promptly to quarters
their honest faces glowing with joy at
the prospect before them

  bob braybrookes face also was joy-
ful and brandreths was frankly radi-
ant

  tyrone who knew what a conflict
against such odds would mean and
professor wedgewood wrere the only
ones who seemed to harbor apprehen-
sions

  the sun almost setting sent its last
level rays over the steamer which now
could be made out plainly enough as the
ballcna one of the two real warships
owned by the so-called republic of pai-
samaril and though this ship was do-
ing the best she could it was evident
that she could not succeed in intercept-
ing the arrozv which trembling from
the thrust of her great turbine engines
was making three feet to the others two

  a string of dots ascended to the war-
ships forward signal yard and broke
out into brightly colored flags

  i thought so said tyrone

  what does she say asked bran-
dreth eagerly

  tells us to heave to she wants to
speak us

  tell her to go jump on herself rec-
ommended the canadian

  this in effect was what the flags ty-
rone caused to be hoisted did say the
reply came promptly from the ballcna
a flash of rusty-red flame sprang
from one of her forward sponsons and
a shell-a heavy one by the sound of it
-went shrieking high in the air over
the arrow

  the yachts after four-inch gun spoke
promptly in return

  this shot also was a trifle high but
the warships foremast gave a little
jump as though startled then lopped
over her side where its resistance to the
water served to turn the ship half
around before the wreckage could be
cut away and forced her to stop her
engines

  a chorus of pleased little yelps went
up from the clasonvacas as another
shot rang out from the arrow and the
shell flying true burst against the en-
emys side

  but tyrone shook his head

  no use he said with her armor
hitting her in the body with our guns is
like flipping peas against plate glass

  i suppose you know what it means to
fire on the warship of a civilized nation
tyrone said willis warningly tech-
nically its piracy

  if our guns were ever so little
heavier id make her realize what it
meant to fire on us replied tyrone
grimly the fighting light in his eyes
piracy or not heavens what rot-
ten gunners those fellows are

  the remark was caused by another
shell from the ballcna which fell far
astern and short as well

  brandreth watched it skipping across
the sea with much interest

  i say old chap he cried soon itll
be too dark for good shooting i was
in the coast artillery you know and
was a bit of a dab with a light gun
might i have a try at her conning
tower if i could hit it it might be a
help

  go to it replied tyrone

  brandreth trotted gayly away the
others looked doubtfully at the ap-
proaching warship

  two reefs extending for ten miles or
more held the arrow between them
beyond them was an interval of com-
paratively open water then two more
reefs continuing the passage outside
these reefs the ballena was running in
a course nearly parallel to that of the
yacht and still somewhat ahead of her
but being overtaken fast her only
hope was to disable the arrow and soon
her broadsides would bear upon it as it
was passing her

  tyrone prayed for darkness but the
sun seemed that day to take an uncom-
monly long time to drop below the hori-
zon-almost as a man might hesitate to
take a dive into water that he knew was
cold

  the enemy was firing slowly feeling
for her range and gradually getting it
poor as her gunners were

  one of the shells clipped a forestay
the clasonvacas yelped again appar-
ently out of compliment to the enemy
a trembling hand was laid on tyrones
arm and looking around he saw that it
was the professor

  wheres your daughter demanded
tyrone remembering the girl for the
first time since the flight from the island
began

  in an apartment below the water
line one of your stewards showed her
there when the first shot was fired the
professor answered are we in great
danger mr tyrone

  you can see replied the person ad-
dressed with a wave of his hand toward
the enemy if she hits us we are we
carry no armor you know

  but well do our best for your rec-
ords and the tricolored sins professor
you can depend upon that-and inci-
dentally for your daughter and our own
skins added braybrooke

  he intended no sarcasm after all the
man was his guest nevertheless the
professor colored under his sandy skin

  listen gentlemen he said earnestly
this is -a matter that concerns even
more than the records for that matter

i doubt if the man who sends that
steamer-who very likely has accom-
panied it-would be interested in them
the sins then  asked bob his curi-
osity roused

  partly but principally it concerns
winifred my daughter i love my
child but love of a woman for a man
before marriage has not seemed to me
essential for happiness my researches
are of paramount importance money
was needed to pursue them and i had
nearly spent my little fortune donald
brandreth has as yet only his allow-
ance-though a very large one i admit
-and is dependent upon his father
and is it possible that you knew so
little about this scoundrel peralta who
is now dictator of paisamaril that you
consented to his marrying your daugh-
ter  asked braybrooke astounded

  i-i certainly did make a conditional
promise in her behalf admitted the
professor his fortune is ample for
three he expressed himself as being
willing to devote it to any cause if by
doing so he could make sure of wini-
fred and i had not discovered the
sins then it was most indiscreet of
me as i now can see to mention this
discovery to admiral peralta but he
pretended to be vitally interested in my

researches and so-

  hes one of the greatest scoundrels
unhanged and one of the most avari-
cious beasts in existence interrupted
braybrooke its the jewels that hes
after rather than the girl i fancy
he is after them both the sins if
sold would assure him the continuance
of his position in his country which at
present is by no means secure he made
that plain when in conformity to my
daughters most vehement requests-i
might say demands-i informed him
that the marriage could not take place
he threatened us both and i think he
would had we stayed have carried out
those threats we were endeavoring to
escape from him when we were
wrecked he must have found one of

the parachutes which-

  hows that braybrooke i say ty-
rone-look

it was brandreth who spoke with a
the tricolored sins



broad smile on his rosy face he was
pointing to the place where the bal
lenas conning tower had been-and was
no longer

  good work  cried braybrooke

  stand by you at the guns added
tyrone look out bos-here she
comes

  seven of the enemys guns now could
be brought to bear and all seven were
loosed at once another shell flew sing-
ing a little over the bridge one of
the quarterboats parted neatly amid-
ships leaving the shattered ends dan-
gling from the davits

  let her have it--everthing that will
reach her yelled tyrone

  willis gave the orders a bugle
sounded and the arrozvs hull quivered
with the crash that followed from the
bridge the shells could be seen as they
exploded harmlessly against the war-
ships armored sides

  but some proved not so harmless
smoke came curling from a sponson
and one gun thereafter was silent two
more guns of lighter caliber and of the
quick-firing variety hesitated and then
stopped as the arrows four gatlings
sprayed streams of bullets around them
and through the ports in their shields

  cease firing called jimmy

  the bugles at willis command re-
peated the order and the firing from the
arrow stopped

chapter iv

a formal visit

the range was very short now the
a two ships were abreast one within
and the other without the line of reefs
a mile or two ahead lay the end of the
first pair of reefs then the opening and
then the second pair the sun had gone
down and the sudden darkness of those
latitudes was falling almost as a cur-
tain might fall

  going over to willis tyrone spoke a
few hurried words

  lights out-all lights came the
order

  the switches were turned and the
arrow left in darkness from below
came men bringing a great tub and an-

other man with a lighted lantern all
carried their burdens toward the taff-
rail

  what are they going to do with those
things asked brandreth of bray-
brooke

  going to drop the lantern overboard
in that tub i suppose then turn and go
in a different direction-probably out
between the two sets of reefs-and try
to make peralta think were still in the
channel i cant imagine what jimmy is
thinking of to try such a game as that
its old as the hills every one knows
it

  of course its as old as the hills and
of course every one is wise to it thats
the reason that its going to work re-
marked tyrone strolling up to the pair
watch

  the arrow had slowed and was plow-
ing through what was now velvety dark-
ness at less than half speed the tub
with the lantern well displayed was
dropped overboard and the yacht kept
on her course passing the opening be-
tween the two sets of reefs and halting
when she got a little distance within the
second set

  watch said tyrone again shell
be needing a pair of stilts directly

  as he spoke those o-board the yacht
heard a faint cheer coming over the
water as the bellcnas lights showed
that she had changed her course and
was feeling her way through the open-
ing in pursuit of the arrozvs supposed
course as jimmy had supposed those
on board of the man-o-war knew the
old trick of the lantern and tub and
doubted nothing that their opponents
had attempted to deceive them by it as
they changed their course

  cautiously she came on her search-
light playing through the opening then
there came a crash plainly heard on the
arrow followed by cries of dismay
the searchlight vanished and the other
lights stopped short

  there we are remarked tyrone in
a tone of deep satisfaction oh wil-
lis  have one of our searchlights
trained on her wont you and see how
shes doing

  the searchlight fizzed and sputtered

then shot its brilliant beam far over the
sea it fell upon the ballena her bow
was high out of water and she listed
heavily to starboard

  another yell this time of rage rose
from her decks and she fired a gun
which on account of the list threw its
shell so high that those on the yacht
could not even hear it

  there that jobs done observed
tyrone with deep satisfaction theres
no better trick than an old one if you
work it backward get her going
please mr willis

  but i say wont those beggars
drown there  asked brandreth

  not they was the reply likely
they can get their ship off if they try
hard enough at the worst they can
take to their boats and make the island
we just left now lets turn in we have
some sleeps coming

  and so they did

  the next day and many other days
thereafter were clear calm and very
hot braybrooke and tyrone lounged
in the lightest of clothing wherever a
breeze would strike them they saw
but little of brandreth these days he
and winifred were generally occupied
with private conversations which
seemed to be of the greatest importance
still they got to know the girl and all
became fond of her

  her father too improved upon ac-
quaintance and when he talked upon the
subject of the migration of an ancient
eastern race and its subsequent devel-
opment on the islands he was most in-
teresting and so the time passed until
one evening the isle of pearls showed
its fringe of palms against the sky

  notwithstanding the fact that there
was a crescent moon it was not thought
safe to run the tortuous passage lead-
ing into the lagoon until daylight had
come to aid them therefore they
slowed and standing on and off sent up
a rocket with blue and red stars the
signal of their coming they were
lounging on deck when a lookout hailed

  a sail-that is something-on the
starboard bow sir he replied in an-
swer to willis question

  what is it  cant you make it out

  looks to me like a launch sir

  it was a launch and in a very short
time a voice hailed from her bow

 oh mr bob-mr jimmy are
you on the ship there yet 

  its abey laughed braybrooke
surely were here abey-come
aboard

  and so abey came brandreth stared
in astonishment at the little man whose
enormous ears and nose almost dis-
tracted attention from the kindliness of
his face but as soon as inquiries as to
the welfare of the respective families
were concluded bob introduced abey
rabinovich as the trusted agent in
charge of the pearl fisheries and bran-
dreth at once took to the odd scrap of
humanity as nearly every one who knew
him did

  well abey how are the pearls
asked braybrooke when the introduc-
tion was over

  they aint no poils-not here mr
bob was the reply i could to have
got a chance to send em all away two
weeks ago so i done it its good i
could find that there chance once i
dont like them black men mr bob
black men repeated tyrone in
surprise what black men

  i dunno mr jimmy i never seen
one before that could be like em they
come a week ago already in three little
ships like the dart 

  schooners explained braybrooke
for brandreths benefit

  yes sir schooners abey went on
some what they have with em are
from south america i can tell them
kinds as good as anybody  but the
others is different an they was askin
me if you an mr jimmy was cornin an
if you could have with you two friends
they said theyd heard in panama you
had took one friend with you an
thought you might have picked up one
more too

  thats odd-it seems as though
theyd heard of your being with us
brandy was braybrookes comment
can you think who these people may
be

  not i replied brandreth with a
shake of his head
the tricolored sins



  tell me the professor broke in
what sort of men are these-ah-ne-
groes-the principal ones among them i
mean 

  there could be two of them chief
men abey replied one of em is the
color like a cigar the other has the
name of fernandez hes from south
america but i cant to find out where
did you hear the former called by
name 

  sure but i cant make to say it
right it sounded kinder like runder
could if be ruran da

  thats it i know when i hear it all
right replied abey relieved

  do you know the man professor
asked braybrooke

  indeed i do i knew him in india
he told me that he was likely to come
to these seas on a quest similar to mine
we have long been friendly rivals he
too had the records which led me to
the sins but he misinterpreted them
i shall be glad to see him-very

  and in anticipation of his triumph
over a brother savant the professor
rubbed his hands and chuckled

  it didnt happen that he wanted
winnie too did it  growled the young
canadian

  why strangely enough he did say
something of the sort replied the pro-
fessor blinking through his round spec-
tacles at the young man who raised the
question i could not think of allow-
ing such a union-between races so dif-
ferent of course but how did you
happen to guess 

  easily enough they all do want
her-and no wonder replied bran-
dreth and so saying he took himself
olf to be seen no more that night

  abeys launch was slung on board
and the little man himself stayed until
morning when at the first tinge of
dawn the arroxu ran in and at sunrise
was at anchor in the sheltered lagoon

  anxiously enough the two partners
standing on the bridge scanned the
shores as they entered despite the
professors assurance of the strictly sci-
entific nature of the excellent ruran
das expedition they were troubled with
doubts the isle of pearls had come to

braybrooke through his wife and so
into the partnership which included the
great arrowhead tract the pearl fish-
ery was a most valuable one and they
had tried so far as they could to keep
its location a secret

  the three schooners of which abey
had spoken were at anchor in the la-
goon but no one seemed to have gone
ashore there was no sign of festivity
or excitement among the white build-
ings of coral rock nestling among the
green coconut palms

  yet those schooners were armed
that they could see through their glasses
plainly enough and it was so unusual as
to have caused comment anywhere in
those seas how heavy their guns might
be laced as they were in their canvas
jackets they could not tell

  ah they were so sure of finding the
sins that they provided cannon for their
protection chuckled the professor

  this all three of the young men
agreed was doubtless the answer that
is the reason for mounting guns and
for providing the schooners with the
motors which all three possessed but
one thing was sure-they would have a
very hard time indeed should they at-
tempt to take the arrow by means of
this armament of theirs

  ah my friend ruran da has an ex-
pedition which i well might have en-
vied a short time since the professor
went on doubtless he was attracted
to this place by those strange sculptured
images of which you have spoken to me
mr braybrooke i hope to see them
but here comes ruran da now

  what does he want to bring three
boatloads of men with him for asked
tyrone his suspicions waking

  oh he is an oriental-some sort of
a prince in his own country he always
goes in state when paying a formal
visit

chapter v

too much appreciation

hpyrone for the time said nothing
more as a matter of fact he rec-
ollected that there did exist on the isle
of pearls some images of stones with
carved inscriptions which might well


top-notch magazine

excite the curiosity of a scientific per-
son on the lookout for such things he
had intended to show them to professor
wedge wood

  the boats of which he had spoken
came in a procession and in the stern of
the leading one he saw an individual
cigar-colored as abey had said wear-
ing a turban of a dull green color and
another man in white ducks evidently
a south american beside him

  do you know them fellers mr jim-
my or mr bob  asked the little man
as the boat came alongside thems
the ones what i was telling about

  no replied braybrooke hastily
keep still now abey they might hear
you

  but i cant get to like them mutts
abey persisted not nohow

  good-naturedly tyrone placed his
great hand over the little mans mouth
so shutting off his speech the boats
hooked fast and led by the person in
the green turban the men came on
board

  it was the professor who met them
it was he after a continued chatter in
a language which his companions-save
one-could only guess was an indian
dialect of some sort introduced them to
the others as fellow workers in the field
of scientific research their conversa-
tion thus carried on naturally did not
especially interest bob and jimmy
soon they drifted away after a little
brandreth came up to the spot where
they lounged on the deck

  say you fellows i agree with
abey said the canadian decidedly i
dont like that bally hindu i dont
believe hes a scientist at all i can un-
derstand what he says i was stationed
in india for a while you know and was
obliged to learn the bat 

  well what is the beggar saying
asked braybrooke indolently

  oh hes talking more or less the
scientific stuff youd expect-about the
migration and so on but hes lots
keener on those stones than i like-and
the old professor is going to show em
theyve been talking about it for ever so
long

  oh for heavens sake let em prat-

tle if they want to they arent bother-
ing us said tyrone tolerantly

  still well go below when they do
and see that no funny business takes
place added braybrooke with an un-
common gleam of prudence and here
comes the professor i fancy to get us
to open the strong room

  he was not mistaken they went be-
low soon the records in beautifully
kept notebooks were opened and with
them the casket

  as soon as the stones were exposed
abey wormed his way into the front
rank and taking the tricolored sins one
by one subjected each to a rapid exam-
ination then he returned to the place
where the three young men were stand-
ing

  well abey what do you think of
em laughed braybrooke

  abey shook his head

  i couldnt call it a good investment
he said stones big as them you
cant get a customer for and if you
cut em up once you lose too much
value already i wouldnt buy em

  nor i laughed braybrooke in re-
turn we have some money between
mr jimmy and me its true but we
havent managed to corral a mint as
yet

  i wouldnt call em no good invest-
ment abey repeated

  and since the two men to whom he
owed such devoted allegiance were not
likely to be financially concerned with
these jewels he lost all interest in them

  wonderful-those stones-are they
not

 it was the south american who
spoke he whose name abey had given
as fernandez

  their value would go far to rescue
my unhappy country-paisamaril--
from her present bondage he added

  are you a friend of peraltas 
asked jimmy quickly

  ah no the man replied with a
meaning smile an enemy but a
rather unsuccessful one-until now

  the last words were shouted and as
though they were a signal which doubt-
less was the fact

  he sprang at tyrone who happened
the tricolored sins



to be nearest and clutching him by the
throat with one hand flashed out a knife
with a movement as quick as that of a
cat

  tyrone was taken off his guard but
with a heave of his powerful arm he
sent fernandez whirling into a corner
of the cabin

  the south american rebounded like
a rubber ball and came back to meet
brandreths fist with the weight of the
young canadians body behind it

  he crumpled to a heap on the cabin
floor

  my word said brandreth and
turned to find other antagonists

  he found them quickly enough
rarely was a surprise more complete
powerful as the three young men were
and all trained to use the muscles of
their splendid bodies they had no
chance from the first

  men whose individual prowess would
have been as nothing fairly swarmed
over them and one after another they
went down each the nucleus of a clutch-
ing struggling mass of humanity too
earnest to waste breath and luckily too
tangled to allow the effective use of
weapons even knives

  braybrooke saw ruran da grasp the
tricolored sins and pocket them he saw
others gather round him and then to-
gether make a rush for the open com-
panionway

  then something fell upon his head
from behind  he saw a firmament full of
brilliant shooting stars which vanished
instantly leaving blackness and oblivion
behind them

chapter vi

abey on deck

jdraybrooke became conscious of
 what he thought was a hard sea
running under the yachts hull some
time later-how long he could not tell-
he discovered that this was due to the
fact thaf his head was behaving in a
most peculiar and extremely uncalled-
for manner and that the yacht was still
at anchor

  opening his eyes he discovered that

the professor was bending over him
that tyrone was flooding him with lib-
eral doses of water from a carafe and
that the sting of brandy was in his
throat

  let up on that water he said
weakly do you want to drown me
whats the matter anyhow

  lie still-youll be all right in a min-
ute said tyrone somebody handed
you a rap on the head with a black-
jack thats all all of us-except the
professor-got the same thing more or
less can you stand try and then
get busy with a rifle

  no use said brandreth who as
braybrooke then saw turned away from
an open port with a rifle in his hand
theyre pulling away dead ahead of us
so we cant see i got two but i didnt
dare fire at the boat that winnie was
in

  winnie repeated braybrooke as
he struggled with tyrones aid to his
feet and staggered toward the compan-
ionway

  no use repeated brandreth sadly
theyve battened us down they did
that when they left-or at least coiled
cables on the hatches and fastened the
companion doors somehow we cant
get out

  did they take winnie with them
asked braybrooke again

  they took everything that they had
time to take replied tyrone gravely

  not everything corrected the pro-
fessor with a sigh they left my rec-
ords they didnt seem to care for
them

  at any other time braybrooke would
have laughed at the evident disappoint-
ment shown by this man of science that
the pirates did not consider the records
of his researches as of enough value to
be stolen along with the tricolored sins
and his daughter but just now there
was not a laugh left in him and what he
said about those records was unprint-
able

  going to a port he looked out but
there was nothing to be seen through it
save the end of a reef and the open sea
beyond


top-notch magazine

  inside the wrecked cabin two bodies
were lying one of them an east in-
dian braybrooke recognized as a person
whose head he had twisted and who
would never speak again another a
little south american lay in a corner
groaning from the pain of a nose that
had been flattened by the blow of some
ones fist until it was hard to see there
ever had been any nose there

  catching him by the collar of his
shirt braybrooke hoisted him to his
feet but the man would not or could
not remain in a standing position his
legs seemed to be as limp as two strips
of cooked macaroni so bob placed him
in a chair

  now then my pirate friend sup-
pose you give an account of yourself
he said grimly

  the man with the flattened nose tried
to draw himself up as he sat and as-
sume an air of dignity in view of the
circumstances the attempt was not par-
ticularly successful

  i am not a pirate he said grandly
i am ramon santiago maria aurelio
nicanor ysabelo-

  oh forget it and get down to brass
tacks growled tyrone

  i am a colonel in the paisamarilleno
army of liberation the man replied
your country-or rather the one
which contains your plantation of the
arrowhead-is at war with paisamaril
therefore what we took were legitimate
spoils

  is a young girl a legitimate spoil
demanded brandreth

  ah replied the other but she was
beautiful and he seemed to think that
this was explanation enough

  and considering the persons with
whom they had been dealing perhaps it
was at all events it left no room for
argument to get the girl back was
the first thing to do

  but how to go about it that was the
question their first move obviously
would he to free themselves-if they
could then this war-which long had
been pending but which had not broken
out when they had sailed from a port
reached by telegraph-would leave them

a range of action much wider than had
the time been one of peace

  were fast in the cabin here right
enough remarked tyrone who had
been on a tour of investigation we
cant even go forward

  weve got plenty of rifle cartridges
though returned braybrooke well
take the powder and blow open the com-
panionway then-

  a knocking at the doors of the com-
panionway interrupted him all ran to
the spot whence it came

  hello  cried braybrooke

  its me-abey came the reply
they started in the confusion they
had not realized that the little man was
missing

  where in blazes have you been
asked tyrone voicing a question which
all three had in mind

  i see the fight come an i beat it
was the response i aint so much good
in a fight im too little an i dont
know how i was yellin once to all
them clasonvacas when somebody
could try to kick me dead so i crawled
nto a boat that hangs on the hooks here
and then pulled the cover over me so
they couldnt to find me no more can
you think which way youll get out yet
mr bob

  no replied braybrooke what
keeps those doors shut

  an anchor there is shoved tight
against them

  where are the men 

  downstairs like you and over the
holes in the floor there are many things
piled

  the enemy would naturally pile many
things-and very weighty things over
those holes in the floor by which
abey whose nautical vocabulary was
limited evidently meant the hatchways
and these things undoubtedly would be
impossible for abey to remove un-
aided

  so in words as simple as they could
make them abey was instructed how to
clear a fall from one of the boats to
hook it into the ring of the anchor which
held the companion doors and then to
lead the running end to the after cap-
stan
the tricolored sins



  it was new work to the little man but
his quick mind caught the notion readily
and after a few intelligent questions he
said that he understood what was
needed

  take care that those fellows dont
come sneaking back and get you
warned braybrooke

  i aint afraid the little man replied
theyve gone clean away once and
anyhow i got one o them little cannons
pointed out to the way they could come
back mr bob i know how to make it
go i seen mr jimmy do it

  thereupon abey departed and they
could hear him moving about the deck
soon the slow clicks of the capstan pawl
each achieved at the expense of many
grunts told that abey was heaving
lone-handed at the obstacle between
them and their freedom

  my records are complete not a note
is missing said the professor joining
the little group which stood listening to
the work in which they were powerless
to aid  i have arranged them all-
see

  he pointed as he spoke to the casket
in which the jewels formerly had re-
posed but which was now filled to the
brim with papers evidently the marau-
ders had considered it too heavy to be
carried away and so had left it in their
flight

  still he went on disconsolately
thats very little comfort now it is
surprising how little it is-most surpris-
ing

  they all understood him in his way
the only way he knew he was express-
ing sorrow for his daughters plight
and a very deep sorrow too where-
upon brandy clapped him sympatheti-
cally on the shoulder which made him
wince there was no time for more

  a series of sounds each one short
that showed that a heavy object was
dragging along the deck told that the
anchor was gradually being pulled to
one side pushing against the doors
bob found that one of them could be
opened a little with an effort which all
but crushed his ribs he squeezed his
way out and the others followed him

chapter vii

a council of four

the deck was not the scene of dis-
order which they had expected to
find it one of the clasonvacas des-
perately wounded lay in the scuppers
that and the cables piled on the hatches
and reenforced with all other weighty
things that could readily be found were
au

  with might and main braybrooke
and brandreth began to clear the stuff
away helped by abey and even the pro-
fessor in a sort of way tyrone a
glass slung over his shoulder ran like a
cat up the main shrouds swept the sea
carefully and then came down again

  theyre out of sight he announced
as he began to lend a hand to the work
on deck theres a smudge that looks
like smoke out there somewhere but
thats all i wonder if mackenzie has
steam up still

  they all wondered a portion of the
engine-room hatch was cleared now and
pounding on it tyrone shouted

  are you there mac 

  aye was the muffled reply

  are you all right

  aye

  is there steam up 

  aye why not  there was a note
of indignation in the reply of the old
chief engineer it should have been un-
derstood without asking such a foolish
question that unless ordered otherwise
he had steam up the mere fact that
the ship had been captured had nothing
to do with that

  whos down there with you  asked
braybrooke smothering a laugh

  all hans an the cooks sir also
captain weelis wha cam skelpin doon
the hatchway like an auld beson juist
afore it was closed

  was he hurt

  weel forbye a-

  ive got a sprained ankle but other-
wise im all right interrupted the voice
of willis open the hatch canft you
and let us out

and the added hands then made short
work of what remained to be done the

dead were disposed of the wounded
cared for and the one prisoner secured
his nose previously having been band-
aged until his head looked like that of
a mummy

  then the anchor was weighed and
the arrow put out to sea as soon as
she was under way a council of four-
willis brandreth tyrone and bray-
brooke-assembled on the deck and also
abey for they placed much dependence
in the hard sense of this little friend and
servant of theirs

  the trouble is we dont know where
to look for the beggars said tyrone
ruefully rubbing his head as he always
did when puzzled the oceans an aw-
ful big place in a case like this

  where was that smudge of smoke
you saw jim asked braybrooke

  dead ahead of us as we stand you
cant see it now

  the ship what made that smoke
couldnt to be cornin this way observed
abey if it was it would be nearer
yet now and if it was going the other
way it would a had to go by here
once so it must a turned and maybe
is chasin them fellers what was here or
tryin to see who they is

  this was an idea which appealed to
them all the clew was not a very good
one it is true but any clew they felt
was better than none and there was no
other

  so the arrow was kept on her course
at top speed sending two whispering
waves to each side of her sharp bows as
they ripped through the calm sea on
the bridge the three young men strained
their eyes hoping once more to see the
smudge of smoke on the horizon and
vainly listening for the cry of the look-
out now perched in the crows-nest
halfway up the foremast

  hark said braybrooke suddenly
after an hour or two had passed dont
you fellows hear something

  they listened more intently and
there came to them a succession of muf-
fled booms from somewhere out in the
ocean

  distant firing-and heavy firing
too exclaimed brandreth its not

the first time ive heard that sound
what in blazes can it mean

  simple enough it seems to me re-
turned tyrone didnt we just hear
that paisamaril was at war
braybrooke shook his head

  i doubt if thats it he said most
likely some one after the tricolored sins

and-

  sail ho called the lookout

  where away called willis in re-
turn

  dead ahead sir there are one two
four of em sir and they seem to be
fightin-or else on fire anyhow theres
lots o smoke

  how far away

  dippin sir but not quite hull down
were cornin up on em fast now

  it was not long before the vessels
could be seen from the deck four of
them as the lookout had said and all
wreathed in smoke of their own mak-
ing-

  minute by minute the reports of the
guns became more and more distinct

  at last tyrone lowered the glasses
through which he was looking and gave
a surprised exclamation

  its the ballena he cried shes
fighting those schooners theyre hang-
ing around her like sparrows round a
hawk

  not for the same reason though
said braybrooke excitedly sparrows
attack a hawk those schooners are
hanging around because they cant get
away look

  this last injunction was quite un-
necessary every eye already was bent
on the group of vessels which now grew
momentarily more and more distinct
the warship of paisamaril evidently
had warped herself off from the reef
where the arrow had left her now as
tyrone had said she was fighting and
her opponents were the three schooners
which had so suddenly departed from
the isle of pearls

  their guns were blazing but it would
have been an act of lunacy for them to
have attacked voluntarily that armored
ship semiobsolete though she was

  even as braybrooke spoke one of the
smaller schooners looking at that dis-
the tricolored sins



tance like a tiny toy cocked her bow
high in the air and went down quite
gradually stern foremost

  brandreth shuddered

  it aint that one what had miss win-
nie on volunteered abey seeing the
shudder shes on the biggest one-
the one that ship is shootin at now
even this was not cheering bran-
dreth shuddered again and the face of
winnies father went ghastly white as
he turned away

  its the two factions of that beastly
yellow republic fighting between them-
selves remarked tyrone we neednt
have butted in on this at all wed let
em slaughter each other if it wasnt for
-- by jove theres another of the
schooners out of business and doesnt
it strike you that the ballena herself is
low in the water theyve made a
pretty general average of it if shes in
trouble i didnt think the guns those
schooners carry could damage her
there was some uncertainty as to
whether or not the ballena was in dis-
tress but as to the schooner there could
be no two opinions 

  smoke but not from her guns en-
shrouded her and soon this smoke was
lighted by flames that licked upward
from her interior

  boats like tiny water insects passed
between her and her comparatively un-
harmed sister whose guns still were
blazing but whose sails were flapping
helplessly in the calm and whose motor
seemed to be disabled

chapter viii

an open boat

qtill the man-of-war made no ef-
fort to close upon the schooner in-
stead the steady fire carried on by both
sides by ineffective gunners who sent
most of their shots wild continued with-
out cessation

  why in blazes doesnt that ship go in
and have it over with i wonder said
braybrooke shifting uneasily

  i dont believe she can returned
tyrone  shes lower than she was
bob ive been watching carefully and
here comes a slant of wind see
ca

  he pointed as he spoke over the ar-
rows quarter when an approaching
breeze tarnished the polished surface of
the ocean as a wet finger dulls a mirror

  what does that mean asked bran-
dreth anxiously

  mighty fine luck for you old man
cried braybrooke with a slap of con-
gratulation on brandys broad back it
means that the schooner can get away
from the fire of that old paisamarilleno
junk pile and then well follow and pick
her up when we want her-dont you
see

  dyou really think so old man
asked brandreth

  think why it must be so just
watch

  the canadian watched they all did
they watched each shot wliich was
fired by schooner or ironclad watched
the wind as it overtook the arrow
passed her and went on to fill the
schooners limp sails then watched the
latter as she heeled over and drew away
from her powerful antagonist which
could do nothing more than send steel
bolts tons of them screatrfing after to
drop into the sea for the most part

  still the arrozv kept her course reel-
ing off the miles behind her and point-
ing straight for the ballena bray-
brooke grew uneasy and at last could
stand the suspense no longer

  arent we going to stand away after
her jim he asked whats wrong
with you anyhow 

  nothing with me replied tyrone
gravely its the ballena look at
at her-yes i thought so 

  even the eyes of the landsmen bray-
brooke and brandreth told them that
now the man-of-war was much lower in
the water than she had been when first
they had sighted her and now as jimmy
finished speaking her red blue and yel-
low ensign bearing a condor in its
union fluttered to her decks to be raised
again instantly but reversed with the
national bird of paisamaril flying talons
uppermost

  is she sinking asked the professor
who had drawn near

she is and we cant leave em there
to drown in that leaky old kettle scoun-


top-notch magazine

drels as they are i wish we could al-
most replied tyrone gravely

  to this the others silently assented
it was abey who spoke the only words
of comfort which could be spoken just
then

  anyhow so long as that other ship
dont sink we can get it most at any
time when we could to want it once he
said philosophically it cant go fast
enough to get away from us but aint
it awful what men will do-kill each
other and sink ships what is worth
money just on account of one goil-an
a little one too

  and after all added the professor
mildly these people ill-advised though
one or both may be are battling for
what they consider the good of their
country it is a civil war

  the others smiled at this but left it to
abey to reply

  i guess if one o them low-lifes could
to find a buyer for them sins as you
call em their country wouldnt see no
more of em said he with an air of
conviction theyd beat it to paris
where all them fellers goes are we
going to take them fellers here on the
ship with us already mr jimmy
tyrone nodded but at the same time
he made it plain that he did not trust
those whom he was aiding any too far

  even as the boats were lowered the
crew went to quarters and it was a
grim array of half-naked brown bodies
lithe and stalwart which greeted the
remnant of the ballcnas crew as it came
on board

  it was not a large remnant peralta
himself the admiral and would-be dic-
tator of paisamanl and about forty en-
listed men  that was all

  peralta-against the advice of bray-
brooke who distrusted profoundly all
of that name-was put on parole his
men confined in the hold and the
great yacht then to the satisfaction of
all changed her course and took up the
pursuit of the schooner now a black
speck almost hull down on the horizon

  she isnt wasting much time
grinned brandreth gleefully as he
came forward after hanging over the
dial of the taffrail log

  and she isnt going to waste any
more if we can help it said bray-
brooke and tyrone nodded emphatic
assent

  the sunll drop in an hour or two
he said afterward therell be a
moon but we want to close in on those
brutes before dark-and the schooner
has changed her course-see hi wil-
lis- well what is it now

  the last words were in answer to a
hail from the lookout

  a boat sir i think-i cant quite
make out the man replied shes two
points on our port bow i think i can
make out something rd in her

  taking a pair of glasses braybrooke
ran up the weather shrouds and fo-
cused the binoculars on the object
which the man had seen in a moment
those on deck heard his voice from his
lofty perch

  it is a boat he called theres
only one person in her-and by jove i
think its a woman-im sure it is yes
-i can see well now shes standing
up waving a red shawl or something
what on earth can a woman be doing
out here 

  its winnie-id lay a horse to a
hen cried brandreth she has es-
caped somehow and is waiting for us
bosh grunted tyrone she low-
ered away a boat herself i suppose
when no one was looking

  to this sarcasm brandreth could
think of no reply nevertheless he
hung over the bridge rail never mov-
ing the glasses from his eyes as he
peered over the expanse of sea ahead
while tyrone and willis sent messages
to the engine room urging mackenzie
to get a little more speed out of his
purring turbines

  and somehow or other mackenzie
managed to do it

  there was a woman out there alone
on the open sea and now it had come
to be a race between the arrow and the
sun if darkness should come before
that boat was picked up she might easily
be missed and a boat is but a little ob-
ject in that great expanse the chance
of sighting her again would be corre-
spondingly small
f

the tricolored sins



  by a very narrow margin the yacht
won one of her boats struck the water
and unhooked before the yachts re-
versed engines could stop her unre-
buked brandreth slid down one of the
falls and clumsily-for he was not ac-
customed to small boats in the open sea
-managed to seat himself in her stern
as she cast off

  as she pulled away the sun disap-
peared and the darkness fell thick
black and star-spangled

  already men wee getting a search-
light ready but this took a little time
and until it could be done the arrows
siren hooted dismally at short intervals
to tell of the yachts whereabouts
through the darkness those on board
heard voices hailing from the boat that
just had left and once braybrooke
thought he faintly could catch the sound
of a feminine voice calling in answer

  then the hails ceased those who
waited the boats return fidgeted impa-
tiently until the ray of the searchlight
burned a silver cone through the dark-
ness once or twice it flashed here and
there then settled framing in a bril-
liant oval the arrows boat and in her
sat brandreth a white bundle clasped
tightly in his arms and his face pale
with a rage that even those who knew
him best never before had seen there

  no one offered to cheer which un-
der ordinary circumstances would have
been the natural thing to do none
could see the face of the woman whom
brandreth held but all knew that it was
winnie an accommodation ladder al-
ready had been lowered and amid a
sympathetic silence the canadian car-
ried his burden to the deck and thence
followed by winnies father below
the arrozvs engines started once more

  east by south a half east mr wil-
lis if you please snapped tyrone

  i hope you know where youre going
-im hanged if i do observed bray-
brooke as willis repeated the order
and the quartermaster at the wheel an-
swered

  we cant see that accursed schooner
now but where do you suppose that
any one who is against the peralta fac-
tion in paisamaril would naturally

make for asked tyrone by way of
reply

  for los santos i suppose replied
braybrooke its a little port but its
the opposition headquarters

  well thats the answer weve lost
him as it is if we can pick him up
there well and good if not-well
well see

  braybrooke was thoroughly satisfied
with this arrangement the country to
which the arrowhead owed allegiance
was at war with paisamaril tyrone
and he held commissions respectively
in the navy and army of its enemies
winnie now was safe and much in the
way of reprisals might be done and
he felt like making reprisals just then
they all did-savage reprisals too

  nor was this disposition flagging
when brandreth came again on deck
and gazed from one to the other for
both had donned the uniforms of their
ranks

  whats this he inquired wonder-
ingly

  they told him and his face lighted
with a fierce satisfaction but his voice
when he spoke was very quiet-omi-
nously so

  do you know what those unutter-
able brutes did he asked but i
know you dont so ill tell you they
saw the arrow coming and just before
they changed their course they put win-
nie over in that boat-an open boat
without food water or oars-for us to
stop and pick her up-if we happened
to see her-while they went off in an-
another direction and if we didnt see
her-well you know what would have
happened i-really old chap i cant
bear to think about it any more dyou
know

  braybrookes face was nearly as grim
as brandreths own why oh why
couldnt that old tub of a ballcna have
captured them instead of letting them
sink her he demanded of no one in
particular

  pardon senor it was not that
schooner which sunk the ballena it
was the injuries which she received on
that reef the loosened plates after-
ward worked looser still


top-notch magazine

  it was peralta who spoke and even
bob believed that for once a man bear-
ing this hated name was telling some
measure of the truth

  and allow me senores to offer the
services of myself and my men if we
can be of any assistance when these
scoundrels are overtaken for fernan-
dez-it is with shame that i say it for
he is my unworthy countryman-is as
great a rascal as this east indian his
ally

  quite as great thank you ad-
miral peralta well let you know if your
services are needed replied bray-
brooke and in the meantime i think
wed better all turn in

  peralta bowed and left as he went
tyrone turned to braybrooke with sur-
prise written large on his face would
you really accept that mans help he
asked incredulously

  are you dotty or just plain idiotic
asked braybrooke in return if he
thinks he can fool us and we let him
think so he may give himself away if
he meditates starting anything when
will we sight los santos

  day after to-morrow somewhere
around daybreak replied tyrone and
leaving the question of dealing with
peralta to braybrooke as he always
did leave questions of this sort he went
below

chapter ix

close quarters

hphey did not however have to wait
long it was late on that very
same night that they sighted the south
american coast and soon after day-
break that a schooner was reported as
being in sight

  she was the one they were after
there was not from the first any doubt
as to that her conduct would have
betrayed her identity even had she not
borne many marks which no sailor
could have mistaken

  tyrone on satisfying himself as to
who she was dove into the chart-house
and shortly afterward emerged using
language of the sort which a naval ex-
perience brings to such perfection

  look at her he exclaimed in an-
swer to their questions going along
in there as easily as though her con-
science was as clear as a babys-and
we here out of gunshot without a
chance in the world 

  we havent a chance echoed bray-
brooke why not pray

  shoals you chump cant you see
the green water there  they reach for
about a million miles in the next three
hundred between here and los santos
and along a little way theres a bay
thats really the mouth of a river yes
-there it opens and there she goes
into it

  as he said the bay was a shallow
one into which the arrow with her
greater draft could not enter or even
approach very closely

  her crew were called to quarters her
engines slowed and with both leads go-
ing she crawled as close as she dared

  she managed to get within extreme
range in time to see the schooner edge
her way into what seemed a winding
stream emptying into the bay and so
out of their sight

  the four-inch gun sent three shells
screaming after her but it was only a
waste of ammunition firing as they
were at an object whose exact position
they could only guess tyrone ordered
the firing stopped then turned blankly
to braybrooke

  well here we are-wouldnt that
jar you he said blankly

  itll jar them before we finish was
the reply things are getting into my
department now jim i dont believe
they can get far

  they cant agreed tyrone and
without asking questions of which he
knew the answers already he went
away to give necessary orders

  boats slapped the water as an anchor
was let go they were provisioned and
armed clad principally in cartridge
belts knives and appreciative smiles
the clasonvacas bundled into the first
ones which then were taken in tow by
one of the two launches which the ar-
row possessed and went streaming
away toward the shore sitting by
the tricolored sins



braybrookes side in the launch bran-
dreth glanced behind them

  why i didnt know that tyrone was
coming with us he exclaimed

  neither did i replied braybrooke
uneasily it looks as though he is
though and with practically every man
we left on board i wonder wrhat he
can be thinking of 

  he soon had an opportunity to ask
the question direct for the other launch
with a much lighter tow shortly over-
took them

  did you think you were going to
have all the fun yourselves you chaps
asked tyrone indignantly not on
your fair young lives i didnt leave the
arrow alone old mackenzie and his
men are there and theyll be enough to
take care of her and the prisoners now
that theres nothing to attack her pull
on bob

  so with misgivings braybrooke did
pull on

  their wray wras slow for the river
twisting and turning as it went was so
covered with tropical growth that the
channel at times was hardly discernible
save by the path that the schooner had
made as she passed through and of
sound there was none save now and
then the call of a bird somewhere con-
cealed in the thick jungle

  then a distant crash like that of a
falling tree followed almost at once by
another reached their ears

  building barricades muttered
brandreth best go easy braybrooke
-ware ambushes

  the same notion had crossed bobs
mind and the boats went onward still
more slowly than before one of the
lighter ones being sent on as an advance
guard after a little she came pad-
dling back for the water weeds were
too thick to permit rowing

  it wasnt trees sir her coxswain
reported it was her masts theyve
cut em away theyre lying plumb
across the channel sir

  this they found to be the literal
truth and there was a sickening delay
while the obstruction was cleared with
axes by the clasonvacas

  they must have been hard pressed

when they did that which is one com-
fort observed tyrone

  or else they repaired their motor
and jettisoned their rigging so as to pass
this mess of growth more easily sup-
plemented braybrooke there-the
ways open let the dinghy go on in
and stand ready to report the rest of
us will follow

  again there followed a period of si-
lence and racking suspense as they
made their way almost inch by inch
along the weed-grown stream

  at last bob could stand it no longer

  halt he cried then added as the
call was sounded jim no schooner
could have got through here unless she
had a tow from an aeroplane what
do you think

 no schooner did get through
whether she could or not these weeds
havent been disturbed by anything so
big but where is she 

  braybrooke did not answer in direct
words they had left the jungle be-
hind and one of the banks was forested
with heavy timber with comparatively
clear ground underneath the trees to
this bank in obedience to his orders the
boats forced their way

  the clasonvacas always ready to
fight anywhere but preferring the land
when land was available for that pur-
pose sprang ashore and fell into line
with the readiness of the trained sol-
diers they were

  the order to start trembled on bray-
brookes lips

 down drop quick-drop i
say

  it was tyrones voice coming from
somewhere above them

  translating the command into native
vernacular bob set the example and
the others fell prone

  they were not a second too soon
hardly had they touched the ground
when there was the crash of a volley
close at hand bullets sang their shrill
whining song through air that a moment
before had been occupied by their stand-
ing bodies

  a rifle or two snapped in return
braybrooke turned to his men angrily

  hold your fire he ordered what


top-notch magazine

do you think youre shooting at you
cant see a soul yet oh jim-can you
tell where they are and where are
you 

  im up here in this tree was the
response and one of those fellows
has just sighted me this is the time
when i come down

  it was indeed time he descended
the tall thin trunk as only a sailor could
but as he said the enemy had seen him
and from the unseen riflemen an irregu-
lar chorus of shots cracked chipping
bits of bark from the tree as he came

  his cap was lifted from his head and
a red welt appeared on one of his cheeks
as he slid to the ground

  theyre behind that line of bushes
in a ditch he said wiping his face
with his hand and looking critically at
his reddened finders you cant dis-
lodge em from here if you fire for a
fortnight and the boats guns cant
help any

  moreover we cant flank em he
added

  theres only one way then said
braybrooke eagerly

  only one his friend agreed then
spoke in the vernacular

 fix-bayonets	

  the bayonets flashed and rattled as
they were snapped in place amid a joy-
ous murmur from the men who handled
them

  the bugle sounded and with a wild
savage war cry which had for centuries
accompanied the entrance of their men
into action the clasonvacas charged

chapter x

jungle tactics

gleet of foot though both bray-
 brooke and brandreth were they
had trouble in keeping ahead of those
seminude savages tyrone and the
white men whom he led were nowhere
but came puffing along as best they
could bringing up the rear

  with another yell the attackers broke
through the screen of bushes and
dropped into the ditch behind it it was
empty not a man of their opponents
remained

  but many tracks in the soft soil led to
a series of paths running through the
jungle which at this point began again
there were three of these paths nar-
row and tortuous

  take the one to the right with
your men jim ordered braybrooke
brandy take half of the clasonvacas
and go to the left ill take the middle
one shout now and then so as to
keep in touch-and dont try to hurry
go slow and look out for ambushes
now start

  the paths wound drearily through
tunnels of living green and stifling heat
sometimes they approached each other
so closely that ordinary words could be
heard from one of the columns to an-
other at other times hardly could a
shout carry through the trees no liv-
ing thing was seen the tracks how-
ever led steadily onward and after
much time had passed ceased at the
bank of a narrow and sluggish but deep
stream

  here there were marks on trees where
a vessel had been moored to the shore
and even the imprint of a gangplank so
deep was the water and so steep the
bank

  tyrone voiced his opinions with force
and fluency if we hadnt been a set of
blithering asses wed have spotted this
from the start as it is weve allowed
those mutts to get away with it like the
abject fools that we are a trick that
a child if it had any natural sense
should have caught onto

  im hanged if i can see what hap-
pened said brandreth ruefully i
fear i havent any sense old man

  of course you havent-who ever
supposed you had retorted tyrone
its so simple that its ridiculous this
stream of course empties into the one
up which we came and probably the
mouth is so choked with weeds that we
didnt see it when we passed they cut
away their masts so as to pass under
the trees got their motor to running
again i suppose or else warped up
then they left a gang to check us while
they made a clean get-away schooner
and all

  thats it agreed braybrooke
the tricolored sins



break back to the boats as fast as you
can boys theres no use in sending
them here they mightnt find the mouth
of this stream for a week hike

  so they hiked retracing their steps
this took time it took time also to
run back through that tortuous channel
and as usual haste wasted speed for
they ran aground which caused another
delay tyrone was fuming braybrooke
morose and brandreth though perhaps
the most unhappy of the three did his
best to be philosophical

  anyhow theyll have to pass the ar-
row he said after a long time offer-
ing the only crumb of consolation he
could think of

  thats just what they will do-and
whos to prevent em snorted tyrone
we were such unutterable fools that
we didnt leave an one aboard to man
her guns

  hark said braybrooke hear
that

  all heard the sound to which he re-
ferred they hardly could help hear-
ing it it was the sharp splitting crack
of the arrows four-inch gun

  others of her guns joined in the
chorus and a desultory fire answered
them the clasonvacas yelled and the
white men cheered as they heard the
sounds

  the stream was wider at this point
and oars were shipped and frantically
pulled to aid the launchs engine

  hardly could they believe their ears
as the firing continued without cessa-
tion it was a little ragged to be sure
but anything under the circumstances
was good

  and then the last turn in the stream
was rounded and the bay once more
opened before them

  the schooner dismasted was lying
low in the water even as the ballena
had been and evidently her motor was
dead for she was slowly drifting by the
arrow which still anchored was pour-
ing shot into her at point-blank range
and she was almost past replying now

  up to the accommodation ladder
which still was as they had left it the
string of boats pulled and braybrooke
followed by his friends ran to the deck

of the yacht there they were met by
old mackenzie a spanner of formidable
length in his right hand and on his
rugged face an expression of serene
satisfaction

  hows winnie-miss wedgewood 
called brandreth as he came up over
the side

  shes weel sir just noo shes be-
low wi her feyther an yon little mon
abey but oh mr braybrooke wed
ha had a fearsome time with yon
schooner if it hadna been for thae pris-
oners

  the prisoners echoed braybrooke

  aye sir its they who hanled the
guns ye can see for yersel

  and as braybrooke and his friends
looked they saw that this indeed was
the fact each gun was manned by a
crew of those whom they had been
keeping under hatches and back of each
gun crew stood a number of the engine-
room force the nozzle of a hose gripped
in his hands

  tha hoses are connected up wi the
boilers explained mackenzie with
pardonable pride tha yellow men
wad rather hanle the guns than get
cooked i offered em the choice an
forbye the mon peralta an ane or two
mair-naethin to signify-they cam tae
little harm

chapter xi

tiie next move

af ackenzie was praised and con-

   gratulated as well he might be
as brandreth afterward observed the
pitting of one set of enemies against an-
other by threatening to parboil them
with live steam was so far as he knew
an entirely new strategic move

  there was no further use for the
prisoners on deckhand they were herded
below and the regular crew took their
customary stations

  hardly had they done so when the
standard of paisamaril its halyards
shot away came fluttering to the deck of
the sinking schooner

  the crew of the arrow cheered and
the firing stopped instantly

  then upon the schooners rail leaped


top-notch magazine

ruran da shaking an impotent fist at
the arrow and pouring forth a stream
of what both braybrooke and tyrone
assumed to be imprecations

  his eyes blazed with a rage that ap-
proached insanity his white teeth
gleamed like those of an animal about
to spring

  whats the beggar trying to get at
brandy asked braybrooke curiously

  hush-listen  was the reply

  for a few wrords more the tirade went
on then suddenly brandy snatched at
the pistol that hung in his belt but too
late

  before he could get it out of its
clumsy holster ruran da plunged his
hand into the bosom of his shirt and
withdrawing it flung from him as far
as he could the three famous stones

  they flashed like sparks of red green
and white as they flew through the sun-
shine and splashed in the bay to vanish
forever

  the beast exclaimed braybrooke
that was a--

  below get below cried bran-
dreth his face white get all hands
below theres no time to waste-do
it now

  that he was in deadly earnest there
could be no doubt and jimmy sent the
order booming along the deck so that
the astonished men obeyed it with their
bodies almost before their minds were
conscious of its import

  now tell us what on earth all this
is about brandy said braybrooke as
they were going down the companion
stairs was it something that old ru-
ran da was saying that made you-

  the speech was never finished

  bob reeled as though struck by an in
visible hand fetching up against the
bulkhead by which he happened to be
standing

  the others clutched at the handrail
as a violent gust of wind passed them
and with it came a crashing report as
though the earth itself hafl split open

  for a little they stood there as though
stunned then tyrone and braybrooke
staggered on deck and the canadian
went with them

  far and near the water was covered

with floating bits of debris a cloud of
smoke was drifting to leeward

  no schooner was to be seen

  thats what i heard that ruran chap
say-that he was going to blow the
whole bally show into the next world
explained brandreth and when i saw k
ijim chuck those stones away i knew he
meant it and called for the rest of you
chaps to stand from under whats the
next move 

  up anchor and get back home to the
arrowhead to rest up if we can
thank heaven we have a ship under us
to get there in replied braybrooke
and his partner nodded hearty acquies-
cence

  well have to go down and break the
newrs of the loss of those jewels to the
old professor though he said its a
hard job that and an unpleasant one-
when one thinks of all it means i dont
want to do it

  none of them wanted to and the out-
come was that all three agreed to at-
tempt it together for greater moral sup-
port

  they waited until the arrow wras un-
der way picking her path to the open
sea then all three went into the cabin

  there around the table sat abey
the professor and winifred with a
chafing dish between them

  one of the professors arms was
passed around the waist of his daugh-
ter who though still pale from the
fright which now had passed nodded
and smiled at them as they entered
the professor also nodded

  ah donald so you have returned
he said have you a match this
lamp was extinguished by the shock of
the explosion thank you

  in blank astonishment brandreth
furnished the required match all
thought that the professor must have
suddenly become mildly insane but
abey reading the thought in their faces
smiled and shook his head so without
comment they watched the older man
as he proceeded with what he had set
out to do

  his conduct did not tend to reassure
them as to his sanity however the
the tricolored sins



chafing dish filled with water was set
to boil then the professor drew to-
ward him the silver cabinet now con-
taining his records and began to pry at
the colored bosses on its lid with the
tang of a file

  soon three of them were released
and he tossed them into the boiling
water a moment later he extracted
them with a spoon dried them carefully
with a napkin and laid them on the
table

  then all saw winking in the light
three stones-white red and green-
the tricolored sins

  they are somewhat smaller than the
imitations the professor remarked be-
fore his astounded friends could find
words for questions but then those
imitations were made along lines indi-
cated by a somewhat unreliable because
exaggerated description in an ancient
poem but the imitations served very
well-really very well indeed no one
thought of the simple expedient of cov-
ering the real stones with sealing wax
but i find myself much fatigued by the
events of the day i think i will re-
tire and he arose from his chair

  good night sir braybrooke man-
aged to say

  the other two still were speechless

  good night answered the profes-
sor are we going to this plantation

of yours mr braybrooke yes good
it is an excellent place to rest and there
may be data there which will help me
in my researches i have been talking
about it to your clasonvacas once
more good night and he went to
seek his bunk

  braybrooke turned on abey

  did you know all along that those
stones were imitations he demanded

  sure i did replied abey rather in-
dignantly why wouldnt i

  why didnt you tell us then asked
tyrone

  you an mr bob wasnt thinkin of
makin no offer for em so twasnt no
skin off none of us responded abey
indifferently but say mr bob-mr
jimmy too-i dont think them two
have got no use for us down here lets
beat it upstairs once

  he spoke of brandreth and winnie
who for the time they had utterly for-
gotten but who in their turn had for-
gotten all but themselves

  they were seated on a cushioned
locker their heads close together and
their minds at last in peace

  and so recognizing the truth of what
abey had said they beat it to the
bridge and with a spirit of thankful-
ness looked out over the sea and re-
flected that each wave that they left be-
hind brought them nearer to their home

dangerous habit

a young englishman after he had been in the far west for a couple of
months began to grow thin wyoming cooking did not appeal to him
besides his squeamish appetite there was another thing that the natives held
against him-his outlandish custom of taking a bath every morning one day his
landlady was discussing him with a friend

    i tell yer what sal said the visitor hes jest a-wastin away a-grievin
for some gal back east thar

    nothin o the kind said the landlady contemptuously you mark my
words now-that young feller hes simply just a-washm of hisself away

  larry harvey wishes to leave his position
in a bank and become a fireman and when
he meets chief forbes of the fire depart-
ment and the latter tells him he is physically
unfit for the work he is only more firmly re-
solved to try to win out

  by hard training he manages to pass the
entrance examinations and enters the train-
ing school his first experience with the
scaling ladders gives him a slight attack of
stage fright which he soon overcomes
but an experienced fireman bull donovan
taunts him with being a coward and harvey
retaliates by striking him

   the affair is settled by a boxing bout in the
cellar of the engine house and harvey is
beaten by donovan who is the boxing cham-
pion of the department they resolve to be
friends after that but bad blood again comes
between them through rivalry for the favor
-of the sister of fireman brooks

  donovan breaks his arm while fighting a
fire and while carrying it in a sling he strikes
harvey and the latter is forced to defend
himself by throwing him down harvey is
then tried before the commissioner for bru-
tality and cowardice but he accepts a repri-
mand without incriminating donovan the
resulting unpopularity of harvey is presently
increased when a number of firemen are
killed at a fire through the failure of the de-
fective hose to carry water to the upper sto-
ries of the burning building and it is learned
that his father mike harvey the contractor
sold the hose to the city

a serial novel

chapter xiv

rough judgment

everybody in the little group

  of weary depressed fire fight-
  ers stared at larry in aston-
  ishment

  until now he had succeeded
in keeping from them all the fact that
he was the son of mike harvey the
well-known and wealthy contractor
not even to his friend tom brooks
had he confided this secret he had
wished his brother firemen to suppose
that his circumstances were the same as
their own for he feared that if it be-
came known that he was the son and
heir of a rich man they might hesitate
to look upon him as one o themselves

  now however his dismay and hor-
ror at captain brooks accusation of his
father had caused him to blurt out the
truth and his comrades lookedat him
half incredulously

 you-mike harveys son ex-
claimed the elder brooks t didnt
know that how is it you never said so
before 

  i didnt think it was necessary re-
plied larry

  you were ashamed of it i guess
declared the captain with an ugly laugh
the fire fighter



for the old man was beside himself with
grief at the loss of his men i dont
blame you for tryin to hide the fact that
you are a son of that dirty crook
larrys face was very pale my
father isnt a crook captain brooks
he cried hoarsely i cant permit any-
body to say that in my hearing

  hes worse than a crook was the
savage retort hes a traitor to the
city hes a murderer the blood of
those seven brave fellows is on his head
he killed em just as surely as if he had
taken a gun and shot them if wed had
proper weapons to fight that blaze with
it never would have got away from us
and those poor boys wouldnt have been
sacrificed what chance did they have
with that rotten leaking hose what
chance did any of us have its a won-
der that there aint more of us lying
dead in those smoking ruins

  but are you sure that it was my
father who sold the hose to the city
cried larry i cant believe that he
would do anything dishonorable

  there aint no doubt about it- re-
plied the captain i tell you i know
positively that mike harvey got that
contract and so youre his son
youre a fine family-the father a
crook who puts our lives in danger for
the sake of a few extra dollars the son
a coward who fights cripples what in
blazes did you join the department for
anyway we dont want your kind
the other men nodded bitter ap-
proval of his words yes what right
has he to be wearin the uniform we
dont want the likes of him among us
fireman tom brooks was the only
man present to speak a word in larrys
defense

  say you fellows make me tired
he exclaimed indignantly whats the
use of rubbin it into harvey even if
his father did sell the rotten hose to the
city is he to blame for that is he
responsible for his fathers doings
didnt he risk his life as much as any
of us at that fire that rotten hose
came near being the death of him too
if it hadnt been for us seein him up
there on the roof and shooting the life
line to him just before the roof fell in

hed be lying there now in those ruins
along with the other poor lads that
shows boys how unfair it is to blame
him

  this argument in spite of its unques-
tionable logic did not carry much
weight with the angry men they were
not in a mood for arguments they
were maddened by the loss of their
comrades and by the bitter remem-
brance of the defeat they had suffered
at the fire and they couldnt help visit-
ing their wrath upon the son of the man
who was responsible for those things

  even captain brooks generally kind-
hearted and just was not influenced by
his sons words he pointed his finger
at larry and growled

  if youre wise young man youll get
out of the department it dont seem
decent that mike harveys son should
be wearin the same uniform as those
brave fellows who owe their death to
him its true as tom says that you
aint to blame but youre your fathers
son and every time we look at your face
we wont be able to help thinkin of our
seven murdered comrades

  yes thats it chimed in one of the
men let him get out if he dont
well force him out

chapter xv

base in gratitude

pearly the following morning larry
called at his fathers office he
clung to the hope that the man who had
sold the worthless hose to the city might
be some other mike harvey he re-
fused to believe that his father was
guilty unless he heard from the latters
own lips that such was the case

  father and son had not seen each
other for some days and the old man
glared at larry as the latter stepped
into the private office

  whats all this that ive been readin
in the papers about you  he demanded
fiercely it aint bad enough that you
should go and be a fireman against your
parents wishes youve got to turn out
to be a coward in the bargain eh 
never did i think that a son of mine


top-notch magazine

could be mean-hearted enough to strike
a crippled man your mother and sis-
ter are half dead with the shame of it
never mind about that now father
returned larry curtly as far as im
concerned-well you shouldnt believe
all you read in the papers but ive
come to see you about a different mat-
ter are you the mike harvey who
sold the last lot of hose to the fire de-
partment 

  yes i had that contract what
about it

  larrys face had turned a shade paler
what about it  he groaned havent
you read about the fire last night

  no i havent seen the papers this
mornin was it a bad fire

  a bad fire i should say it was
seven of our boys were killed there-
killed because of the rotten hose you
sold the city oh father i didnt think
it could be true i didnt think that you
could be as bad as all that

  the old man scowled at his son
what do you mean by talkin to me
like that he roared what do you
mean by rotten hose  who says it was
rotten 

  larry laughed bitterly if you had
been at the fire father and had seen
the way it burst you wouldnt ask such
a question  there were so many leaks
that we scarcely had a stream to fight
that fire with that is why it got away
from us and those fellows were killed
the boys say that you are responsible
for those deaths father theyve been
calling me the son of a murderer and a
crook they want me to get out of the
department because they say that the
son of mike harvey isnt fit to associate
with them i came here hoping that i
could go back and tell them that they
lied

  oh what made you do it he went
on bitterly youre a rich man you
didnt need the dirty money-the price
of mens lives-as badly as all that
why have you disgraced us 

  his fathers face had turned as white
as his own my boy said the old
man huskily  tis sorry to hear this i
am-sorry to hear that the hose is no
good and that they blame me for it

i swear that i didnt mean to cheat the
city i thought the contract was bein
filled in good faith the same as every
other contract ive ever undertaken

  then how did it happen that you
unloaded that worthless stuff upon the
fire department demanded larry half
incredulously although he was begin-
ning to gain fresh hope from his fathers
words do you mean to say that you
didnt know what you were selling

  the elder harvey nodded yes
thats it i didnt know i dont un-
derstand much about that line of busi-
ness and i took it for granted that those
goods was all right ive been made a
tool of by others i suppose if theres
goin to be trouble ill have to bear the
brunt of it but i want you to believe
my boy that it aint my fault if they
tell you that your father is a crook you
can tell them that they lie tis a poor
dupe ive been but not a crook

  he proceeded to explain to larry
how he had been induced by some po-
litical friends to lend his name to a new
company they were forming the sole
purpose of this company was to land the
contract for supplying the fire depart-
ment with new hose the company was
to be called the harvey hose company
and larrys father was to be its presi-
dent and receive thirty per cent of the
profits

  the hose for the filling of this con-
tract was supplied by a manufacturing
company in which these political friends
were heavily interested old harvey
had not suspected for a minute that
there was to be any attempt to increase
the profits by handing the city inferior
goods

  armed with this explanation larry
went back to the engine house and nar-
rated to tom brooks the only man in
the company whom he could now look
upon as his friend what his father had
told him

  its too bad said brooks sympa-
thetically i havent any doubt larry
but what your old man is as innocent as
he claims but unfortunately hes going
to have a hard time proving it as he
says theyll make him the goat i guess
therell be a big fuss raised about that
the fire fighter



hose and possibly the grand jury will
take up the matter

  now old man he went on i dont
want to hurt your feelings but dont
you think under the circumstances that
what my father said last night was about
right  wouldnt it be a wise move on
your part if you were to get out of the
department 

  larry received this suggestion with
great indignation i didnt expect this
from you tom he said i thought
that you were my friend

  i am your friend insisted the other
and that is why i am giving you this
advice i honestly believe that it wrould
be foolish of you to remain here under
the circumstances although of course
you are not to blame the boys wont
look upon the matter in that light they
cant help feeling sore on you i guess
after all larry its only human na-
ture for them to dislike the son of the
man whom they blame for putting their
lives in danger and being responsible
for the death of those poor fellows

  if you stay in the department old
fellow he continued im afraid they
are going to make it very disagreeable
for you even if you were to be trans-
ferred to another company things
wouldnt be much better for you for i
guess all the boys in the department feel
pretty sore about that hose and after
all larry there isnt any reason why
you should be a fireman is there it
isnt as if you had to earn your living
this way as is the case with most of us
your old man is rich so you dont have
to worry theres lots of other jobs
besides fire fighting

  maybe there are replied larry
grimly but i think i prefer this one
im grateful to you for your advice
tom and i think you mean well
enough but i want to tell you right now
that im going to stick no matter how
disagreeable they make it for me they
wont succeed in making me quit if i
did id be the coward they think me
brooks slapped him approvingly on
the back i guess youre right larry
i meant to advise you for your good
but on second thought i must admit
that you would be a coward if you were

to let them force you out stay and
fight em to a finish old fellow you
can count on me to help you all i can
thanks said larry as he grabbed
his friends outstretched hand youre
the right kind of a pal tom

  the two men had been alone in the
sitting room of the engine house during
this conversation they were now in-
terrupted by the entrance of bull dono-
van who came toward them with a
scowl upon his face and a wicked glint
in his small eyes

  say brooks he exclaimed what
do you mean by talkin with this fellow 
dont you know that the boys have held
a meetin and decided that were all go-
in to leave him entirely to himself  we
think that the son of mike harvey aint
fit for honest men to associate with
larry was so taken aback by this
thrust from the man who had so much
cause to feel grateful to him that for a
few seconds he stood staring at the
speaker unable to give expression to the
indignation that was surging within him

  then his voice trembling with rage
he cried  you dirty cur what right
have you to class yourself among hon-
est men ive kept silent long enough
about you bull donovan it was more
than you deserved but i made up my
mind that since you werent man enough
to come out with the truth i wouldnt
show you up and i would have con-
tinued to keep my mouth shut too if it
hadnt been for this

  but now he went on shaking his
finger in donovans face im not going
to spare you any longer im going to
tell the real story of what happened that
day and let the boys judge who is the
least worthy for them to associate with
you or i

chapter xvi

a question of veracity

otrange as it may appear at first
blush donovans animosity toward
larry harvey had been increased in-
stead of diminished by the fact that the
latter had shielded him in the trial room
at headquarters and afterward

  and yet taking into consideration the


top-notch magazine

moral caliber of the man his attitude
was exactly what might have been ex-
pected of him he could not think of
his generous rivals self-sacrifice with-
out despising himself and the more he
despised himself the more he hated the
man who caused him to do so

  we have all met this type of fellow-
the surly brute who having done you an
injury will hate you more if you heap
coals of fire upon his head than if you
retaliate in kind put yourself on his
level and he can almost feel kindly to-
ward you because you do not cause him
to experience a sense of inferiority but
show that you are a bigger man than he
and you will increase his enmity ten-
fold thus it was with donovan in his
attitude toward larry

  when the men of the engine company
held a meeting to decide what course of
treatment should be handed out to the
son of the man who had imperiled their
lives by the crooked deal in hose dono-
van instead of keeping in the back-
ground out of a sense of gratitude to
larry had been the most fierce in de-
nouncing him and in insisting that he
be punished for his fathers offense

  it was he who had suggested that it
would be a good thing to give fireman
harvey a silence as they call it in the
navy and let him live and work among
them henceforth without taking any
more notice of him than as if he had
been deaf and dumb this drastic treat-
ment he argued would pretty soon
break the young mans spirit and re-
sult in his handing in his resignation

  the other men agreed that this
sounded like a good plan and voted to
put it into effect brooks had not been
present at the meeting and therefore
seeing him now in friendly conversation
with larry donovan had lost no time
in acquainting him with the will of the
majority lie realized that it would
spoil the whole effect of the silence if
its victim was on speaking terms with
even one member of the company

  at larrys threat to reveal the truth
about his encounter with donovan the
latter laughed contemptuously he had
been expecting this and was fully pre-
pared for it

  tell them what lies you like if you
can get them to listen to you he
sneered

  tell it to me larry exclaimed
brooks eagerly ive felt sure all along
that you didnt get a square deal in that
matter im mighty glad that youve
decided to speak out at last tell me
the story and ill tell it to the other
boys theyll listen to me i guess
donovan scowled at him do you
mean to say brooks that you aint goin
to abide by the will of the majority-
that youre goin to remain friends with
this feller when all the rest of us have
decided to cut him out

  i dont let anybody pick my friends
for me or tell me who i mustnt talk
to was the cold reply you fellows
can do as you please about harvey bull
but as i was telling him just as you
came in he can count on me as his
friend

  i guess i understand why sneered
donovan crooked money will buy as
much as the other kind of course
just what do you mean by that de-
manded brooks angrilyi

  i guess my meanins plain enough
retorted donovan i dont suppose
youd be so anxious to claim this fellow
for your friend if he wasnt the son and
heir of mike harvey the rich con-
tractor its surprisin what a differ-
ence a few dirt dollars make but the
rest of the bunch aint so mercenary
brooks

  toms face flushed with anger and he
raised his clenched fist menacingly he
was not as powerfully built as dono-
van and he was first on the civil service
list for promotion to the rank of lieu-
tenant so that he could ill afford to en-
gage in a brawl in company quarters
but nevertheless he would have fought
the sneering champion of the depart-
ment then and there if it had not been
for the sight of the latters limp left
arm resting in its sling

  suddenly realizing the bullys disabil-
ity he managed to check himself

  you big stiff he cried i can un-
derstand how larry here couldnt help
assaulting you the other day i sup-
pose rou made him so mad with that
the fire fighter



foul tongue of yours that he lost all con-
trol of himself

  he did more than that tom de-
clared larry he struck me before i
laid a hand on him he was about to
strike me again and i grabbed him by
the throat and threw him off that is
the truth about that affair chief forbes
came in just as he fell to the floor and
not knowing that it was in self-defense
that i did it accused me of attacking a
crippled man

  but why didnt you tell that story at
your trial demanded brooks looking
at larry in astonishment what on
earth made rou keep mum you might
have got off without even a reprimand
if you had explained matters to the com-
missioner

  i didnt want to snitch on donovan
answered larry he was lucky
enough to escape a complaint and i
thought i might as well suffer alone in-
stead of putting him in bad too you
see it wasnt his fault that chief forbes
came in just as i knocked him down it
seemed to me that it wouldnt have been
quite white to have snitched on him
the chances are that both of us would
have been punished in that case for
quarreling and fighting i thought i
might as well be the goat i didnt fig-
ure that as a result of doing this id be-
come so unpopular with the men

  and this fellow was satisfied to keep
quiet and let you be branded as a cow-
ard eh  exclaimed brooks with a con-
temptuous glance at donovan

  it isnt true declared the latter sul-
lenly the story he tells is a fake from
beginning to end brooks i never laid
a hand on him does anybody suppose
id be fool enough to start a fight in my
present condition we was havin a
friendly argument about a civil service
rule-at least i thought at the time that
it was a friendly argument-and sud-
denly this fellow jumps up and he says
the other day you knocked me out
now is my chance to get square bull
donovan he says

  of course i was helpless with this
arm of mine in a sling went on the
bully so i says to him you wouldnt
hit a man in my condition would you

harvey give me a chance wait un-
til this bum arm of mine gets well again
and ill give you all the fight youre
lookin for dont be a coward and take
advantage of the fact that im a crip-
ple i says to him as soon as id said
that he grabs me by the throat and
throws me to the floor on the back of
my head- i guess hed have done a
whole lot more to me too if the big
chief hadnt come in just then and
caught him at it

  donovan had been rehearsing this
story for the past few days in expecta-
tion of being denounced by larry har-
vey and he was therefore able to deliver
it with a fluency which gave it a strik-
ing semblance of truth

  larry who had never before heard
anybody lie so glibly stared at him in
astonishment

  that is the real story of what hap-
pened brooks bull went on i didnt
tell all of it to the commissioner at the
trial because i didnt want to be too
hard on this fellow but now since hes
lookin for trouble i aint goin to keep
quiet any longer

  the cool audacity of the man in thus
twisting the situation completely around
took larrys breath away he was
greatly relieved to hear brooks declare
that he did not believe a word of dono-
vans story and that he felt confident
that their comrades would accept lar-
rys version

  well see whether they will or not
snarled bull shaking his fist at the two
friends as he moved toward the door
the boys have known me for years
and never yet caught me in a lie they
dont know anything about harvey ex-
cept that hes the son of the man who
sold the rotten hose to the department
well see which of us will be believed

  dont worry larry said brooks
after donovan had gone out i guess
i wont have much trouble in persuading
the bunch that they have done you a
great injustice in branding you a cow-
ard and i am in hopes that when they
hear how white youve treated bull and
what a rotten deal youve had theyll be
willing to listen to reason about this un-
fortunate hose business theyre a


tqp-nqtch magazine

pretty decent crowd of fellows taken all
in all and i reckon that when theyve
heard your story there wont be a man
that wont want to shake your hand

  the other was greatly cheered by this
prospect of course and it was a bitter
disappointment to him when brooks
came to him that evening with a look
on his face which told larry even be-
fore he spoke that he had failed in his
mission

  they wouldnt listen to me con-
found em said larrys friend gloom-
ily donovan told his story and they
fell for it-every one of them when i
tried to argue with them they laughed at
me they said that it was a mighty
queer thing that you had waited until
now to spring that defense they
wranted to know larry why you hadnt
come out with it before and refused to
believe the reason i gave them

  you see old man he went on apolo-
getically as bull boasted to us theyve
known him for such a long time and
they dont know you very well i guess
it isnt more than natural that they
should take his word in preference to
yours im awfully sorry

  well it cant be helped replied the
other im much obliged to you tom
for your trouble im lucky to have
such a stanch pal as for the other
fellows-well i guess ill be able to jog
along without their friendship i sup-
pose itll be pretty lonely here with no-
body to talk to when youre not around
but if they think they can force me to
quit by such treatment theyll find that
theyve got another guess coming

  a savage glint came to his eyes as he
went on and as for that contemptible
liar donovan-well you just wait until
he is able to use that left arm of his
again tom last time we fought down
in the cellar i wasnt able to stand up
against him for more than six rounds
my lungs were full of the smoke id
swallowed at my first cellar fire and i
was half licked before i started to fight
but this time im going to be in proper

silence

the days that followed were
 wretched soul-trying days for
larry harvey if his had been a less
rugged and resolute character and if his
fighting blood had not been continually
kept at the boiling point by the con-
sciousness that he was being unjustly
dealt with the chances are that he would
have succumbed to the strain and been
forced into sending his resignation to
fire headquarters

  to be shunned entirely by the fel-
lows one is working with to be among
them but not of them to have to work
day after day without a single person to
talk to that is one of the most cruel and
severe tortures to which a warm-
hearted companionable young man
qould be subjected

  larry wouldnt have been so badly
off if he could have continued to enjoy
the society of his good friend tom
brooks but unfortunately for him
an official order temporarily transfer-
ring young brooks to another engine
company at the other end of the city
came from headquarters a day after the
silence was put into effect and thus
larrys excommunication was com-
plete

  to add to his suffering the grand
jury after looking into the matter of
the worthless hose which had been sold
to the city by the harvey hose com-
pany decided to find an indictment
against larrys father making him the
scapegoat for the rascally band of poli-
ticians who had beguiled the old man
into lending his name to the company

  the newspapers were full of the
scandal the elder harvey was held up
to public scorn and his protestations of
being innocent of intentional wrong-
doing were sneered at by the press

  mrs harvey and larrys sister
kate were heartbroken with shame and
fear

  the young man who felt that he
should be constantly with them in this
time of trouble was unable to give them
more than one day out of every five
that being all the liberty which a mem-
the fire fighter



ber of the new york fire department
is allowed

  larry came in for a lot of painful
notoriety the newspapers had until
now been in ignorance of the fact that
the son of mike harvey the wealthy
contractor had joined the fire depart-
ment but they discovered that such was
the case and made much of the discov-
ery

  they rehashed the report of the pro-
ceedings at fire headquarters when
larry had been tried for conduct pre-
judicial to good order and discipline
and denounced by the commissioner for
striking a crippled comrade

  larry was horrified to find his pic-
ture in every morning and evening pa-
per and columns about himself under
such humiliating headlines as

mike harveys fireman son called
coward by commissioner

  the papers had all printed short ac-
counts of larrys trial at the time it
had taken place but they had not
known then that the fireman harvey
mentioned therein was the son of mike
harvey and therefore they now re-
published the storr giving it twice as
much space as it had occupied the first
time

  in spite of these afflictions larry
maintained a stiff upper lip his face
became paler and he appeared to have
lost some flesh under the strain but he
held his head high and went about his
duties with a forced cheerfulness which
showed his persecutors that they could
not break his proud spirit

  fortunately for him the engine com-
pany of which he was a member was
one of the busiest in the city and he
and his comrades were kept on the
jump day and night answering alarms
and fighting fires

  one morning he was on the appara-
tus floor doing his turn at sentinel duty
when the street door opened and flor-
ence brooks entered

  larry had not seen the girl since the
day when she had called him a coward
and told him that she did not wish him
to address her he therefore made no
a

attempt to speak to her now and was
much astonished when she came toward
him with her hand outstretched and a
cordial smile upon her pretty face

  fireman harvey she said i want
to apologize to you for what i said the
other day i had no right to form an
opinion so hastily and i am sorry for
it

  then you-you believe me and not
donovan  he stammered an expres-
sion of joy lighting up his pale face

  he guessed that tom brooks had
told his sister the real story of his trou-
ble with bull and that that was the
reason for her changed attitude

  well i cant say that exactly mr
harvey the girl answered with a
frank smile you see i dont know
which of you to believe tom has told
me your side of the story and tried to
persuade me to believe it but on the
other hand mr donovan has sworn
to me that his version of the affair is
true that leaves me in doubt

  you see i have known bull for a
long time she went on earnestly and
while i know that he is rough and some-
thing of a bully i should hate to think
that he is the contemptible fellow he
must be if-pardon me for putting it so
bluntly-you are telling the truth at
the same time mr harvey i have
great respect for my brother toms
judgment and since he believes in you
so thoroughly i am almost inclined to
do so too therefore i have decided
to form no opinion in the matter at
present i hope that some day the
truth will come out i feel confident
that it will in the meantime i hope
you will forgive me for my meanness
of the other day and look upon me as
your friend

  tom eagerly seized the hand that she
extended this is good of you miss
brooks he said earnestly it is what
i might have expected of-of toms
sister

  after that the cheerful look upon
larrys face was not as forced as it
had been the lonely fellow felt so en-
couraged by the girls altered attitude
toward him that he did not mind the
treatment of his comrades as much

  there was another factor which
tended to keep up larrys spirits and
that was the knowledge that donovans
broken arm was rapidly healing he
knew that the time when he would be
able to settle scores with his enemy was
not far off now

  and one morning when larry came
down to the apparatus floor to line up
with the other men for roll call a thrill
of joy shot through him as he glanced
at donovan standing at the other end
of the line

  for the latters left arm was no
longer in a sling the surgeon had pro-
nounced it cured and bull was once
more an able-bodied fireman

  after the - roll call the other men
crowded around donovan to offer their
congratulations after they were
through larry approached him an
eager smile upon his face

  im glad your arm is all right again
he said quietly when do we fight
i dont want to rush you i guess that
arm will be stiff for a while yet ill
give you all the time you need to lim-
ber up but please dont keep me wait-
ing a day longer than is necessary

chapter xviii

the second fight

hthe second fight between harvey
and donovan was one of the great-
est ring battles that ever took place in
either professional or amateur sport

  the battle did not take place in the
cellar of the engine house which had
been the scene of the first encounter be-
tween harvey and donovan when a
large circle chalked on the cement floor
had served as a ring both men consid-
ered the issue of this second fight too
important for such informality

  the private gymnasium of professor
biff obrien ex-champion middle-
weight of the world and the man who
had trained larry for the physical part
of his civil-service examinations had
been selected by mutual agreement as
the scene of the combat

  by mutual consent too obrien was
selected to act as referee although
larry had been the mans pupil dono-

van was satisfied to allow the profes-
sor to take charge of the fight he
knew biffs reputation for squareness
and had no fear that he would show
partiality

  the event took place on the after-
noon of harveys day off donovan
was also off duty so there was no dan-
ger of the fight being interrupted by a
sudden call to a fire

  the spectators were mostly firemen
men from various engine and hook-
and-ladder companies who were off
duty or had taken a chance and
sneaked out of company quarters and
as fireman harvey was the most un-
popular man in the department their
sympathy was all one-sided

  larry was made to realize this when
he stepped into the ring and was greeted
at first by a stony silence with some
men the knowledge that the crowd is
against them will take a lot of the fight
out of them upon others it will pro-
duce an exactly opposite effect larry
fortunately belonged to this latter
class as he gazed upon those cold
unfriendly faces at the ringside and
read in each one of them the hope that
he would go down to defeat he scowled
defiance at them and said to himself
grimly im going to disappoint em
all

  then he heard a man in the front
row say after all it doesnt seem
square not to give the poor beggar a
send-off come on boys 

  he started to clap his hands and a
good many of the other men followed
suit larry however was not at all
conciliated by this round of applause
for the patronizing manner in which it
was given was even more humiliating
than the stony silence which had at first
prevailed

  then bull donovan stepped into the
ring and was received with such noisy
enthusiasm that obrien was compelled
to warn the audience that if they were
not careful they would attract the at-
tention of the police with the result
that all hands would be pinched for
participating in a prize fight

  because of his reputation as a bully
donovan had never been particularly
the fire fighter



popular in the fire department but his
fellow fire fighters cheered him wildly
now because they regarded him as an
instrument of vengeance

  they were thinking of their seven
brave comrades who had perished be-
cause of the rotten hose which mike
harvey had sold to the city and they
yearned to see mike harveys son
thrashed unmercifully by the husky
champion who stood in the center of
the squared ring acknowledging their
plaudits by a broad grin

  a formidable-looking opponent was
bull donovan as he stood facing har-
vey eagerly waiting for the signal to
begin fighting almost nude the won-
derful muscular development of the
man impressed itself upon the audience
and conveyed the belief that he could
not possibly go down to defeat

  the other combatant however did
not impress the onlookers as being any
weakling grudgingly they were
forced to express their admiration of
larrys broad chest the spread of his
shoulders the solidity of his thighs his
wonderful back development and his
long slim arms under the skin of which
the muscles played like writhing snakes

  as the spectators at his previous fight
with donovan had noted he was not
quite as tall as his adversary and was
at least fifteen pounds lighter his
chest and shoulders too huge though
they were were not as powerful as
bulls and the latters arms were of
greater circumference

  observing this difference in the physi-
cal proportions of the two men tom
brooks who was acting as larrys aec-
ond was filled with anxiety he de-
rived some comfort however from the
recollection that at the last fight larry
had shown that he possessed more sci-
ence than donovan and moreover he
had managed to stand up against the
latter for six rounds on that occasion
although he had been in no proper con-
dition to fight now larry had as-
sured tom he felt in perfect shape and
was confident that he was going to win

  for the love of mike be careful old
pal brooks whispered as he adjusted
the fastenings of larrys gloves if

you let that cur lick you youll break
my heart boy

  i tell you he isnt going to lick me
tom was the confident reply when

i	think of the dirty deal that fellow has
given me i feel that i cant lose the
fight

  as the two men faced each other in
the center of the ring biff obrien
not being aware of the deadly enmity
which existed between them-for they
had told him that it was merely a con-
test to decide who was the champion
of the fire department-said briskly
now boys shake hands

  both larry and donovan shook their
heads emphatically

  the latter growled with your kind
permission mr referee well dispense
with the handshaking

  biff frowned at this he did not like
grudge fights in his long experience
in the ring he had never once refused
to shake hands with an opponent he
did not argue the matter however
with a shrug of his shoulders he gave
the signal to commence and the battle
began with a rush

  the fury with which they immedi-
ately hurled themselves at each other
showed how each had been looking
forward for weeks to this encounter
and how bitterly each hated his oppo-
nent

  generally the principals in a finish
fight mindful of the necessity of pre-
serving wind and vitality do not put
their full force into the first few rounds
but neither harvey nor donovan was
in a mood now to consider the value of
conservation of energy

  they went at each other like two
savage bulldogs who have slipped their
leashes at the same moment the sound
made by their gloved fists as each rained
blows upon the others face and body
caused the onlookers to realize the ter-
rible power behind those whirling pis-
ton-rod arms the blows landed in
such rapid succession that they sounded
like the steady thud-thud-thud of a man
hitting a punching bag

  wonderful fighting exclaimed a
man at the ringside as the bell sounded
the close of the first round but the


top-notch magazine

fools cant keep that up theyll have
to slow down in the next round

  over in his corner larry was being
lectured by brooks for heavens
sake old man dont lose your head
you went at him like a fiend in that
round hes a bigger and heavier man
than you and hell beat you at that
game dont forget your science you
dont stand much chance against him in
a mere slugging match but youre twice
as clever as he is and you can put him
down and out if only youll be sensible
and take things easy

  larry nodded his approval of this ad-
vice  but when the bell rang he rushed
at his opponent with the same ferocity
which he had displayed at the opening
of the first round brooks groaned as
he saw the energy his man was ex-
pending as rec-dessly as though the
fight was to be only a three-round af-
fair and the terrible punishment he wtas
receiving

  it was small comfort to larrys sec-
ond to perceive that donovan was using
up an equal amount of vitality and re-
ceiving quite as much punishment for
brooks felt sure that in a mere endur-
ance contest the enemy must finally pre-
vail he knew donovans extraordi-
nary capacity to take punishment and
his marvelous vitality at the end of
the second round he again warned
larry and implored him to fight more
carefully

 larry promised that he would
hearken to this advice he had recov-
ered his self-control by this time and
in the next round he began to display
his cleverness he dodged and ducked
several of donovans savage swings with
a skill which caused the onlookers to
forget that they wanted to see him go
down to defeat and they applauded him
generously

  from that round on larry showed
that he was easily the master of his op-
ponent as far as science went

  he got in three blows for every wal-
lop bull was able to land the latters
punch however seemed to have more
force behind it than larrys every
time his huge fists came in contact with
his adversarys head or the vital parts

of his body the spectators expected to
see a knock-out

   they were amazed at the indifference
with which larry received those vi-
cious blows and marveled at his endur-
ance the more punishment he re-
ceived the stronger he appeared to grow
and the faster he fought

  several times during the twenty-
six rounds of terrific fighting he was
knocked down by the swing of dono-
vans mighty arms but he was always
up again before the referee was half-
way through the fatal count hurling
himself at his antagonist with a vigor
which compelled the latter to give way

  when the twentieth round was
reached larry presented a spectacle
terrible to look upon his eyes were
almost hidden in the mounds of swol-
len flesh which donovans powerful
fists had raised his nose was bat-
tered his lips were puffed and bleed-
ing

  his opponent however was not in
much better shape his face was cut
and swollen and there were angry red
patches on the white skin over his ribs
and abdomen which showed that larry
had not neglected to pound his body as
well as his head

  the men at the ringside observing
these evidences of the awful punish-
ment which each had received said to
each other confidently as the bell rang
at the close of the twentieth round and
the two combatants staggered to their
corners

  the bull will win both men are
groggy now they cant keep it up
much longer harvey has put up a
game fight but he will go out first
when it comes to endurance there isnt
a man living that has it on donovan

   but to their great astonishment and
dismay it was donovan and not larry
that first showed signs of going to
pieces

  the latter tired battered half
blinded though he was stepped into the
ring as the bell rang the opening of the
twenty-first round with a vim which
made him appear almost sprightly in
comparison with his opponents labored
advance
the fire fighter



  something which his friend tom
brooks had whispered to him as he
sponged and fanned him with a bath
towel had acted as a powerful stimu-
lant upon his exhausted body

  larry youve got to win old man
brooks had said ive promised my
sister to hurry home as soon as this
fight is over and tell her the result
she has been praying that whichever of
you two fellows has told her the truth
will be the victor if you lose shell feel
that donovans story is a true one
those words sent larry into the ring
with a feeling that it was not in the
power of any human being to knock
him out-and that is a fine feeling to
have in the twenty-first round of a fight

  and there was another incident
which served still further to stimulate
him in the twenty-fourth round a
warm adherent of donovans noting
with deep concern the fact that the
champion was tottering and seemed on
the verge of collapse sprang to his feet
and yelled frantically

  brace up bull put him out are
you going to let the son of that dirty
grafter mike harvey win this fight
these words did more good to larry
than they did to the man for whose
benefit they were intended furious at
the taunt and the memory it brought
up of the wrongs he had suffered at the
hands of his comrades he hurled him-
self at his opponent with such savage
fury that it was only by desperate
clinching that donovan saved himself
from being knocked out in that round

  after that the end of the fight was
apparent to all donovans pitiful ef-
forts to save himself in the next two
rounds convinced the onlookers that he
could not last much longer

  nobody was surprised when the fin-
ish came a straight left from larry
delivered with so little force that his
opponent would scarcely have felt it if
it had been received in one of the earlier
rounds-for larry was too much worn
out to have much of a sting in his punch
-landed on donovans chin and sent
the champion of the fire department un-
conscious to the canvas floor of the
roped arena

  as his seconds carried the defeated
man away and larry stood clutching
the ropes so groggy that he could not
stand alone tom brooks jumped into
the ring and addressed the group of
dazed firemen

  boys he shouted placing his hand
affectionately upon the shoulder of the
departments new champion this man
won because he had the right on his
side ill leave it to you is there a
man here who believes that a fellow
as game as larry harvey could be cow-
ard enough to attack a cripple  if you
think so keep silent and continue to do
injustice to one of the best fellows weve
ever had in the department but if you
believe now that this man has had a
rotten deal let me hear you tell him
so

  the fireman who had shouted the
slurring remark about larrys father-
he was the driver of the engine of lar-
rys own company-jumped upon a
chair and waving his arms excitedly
above his head shouted

  boys three cheers for larry har-
vey-our larry

  and there was not a man present who 
did not join the hoarse chorus that fol-
lowed

cfiapter xix

the best of all

after that there was no attempt on
the part of his comrades to sub-
ject larry to the torture of the silence

  there was not a man of them now
who did not believe larrys version
of his trouble with donovan they
agreed with tom brooks that a fellow
who could put up such a gallant fight
was not the kind of man who would be
guilty of a cowardly act

  it was not the fact that larry had
won the fight which caused them to
hold this view even if donovan had
been the victor of that great battle their
opinion would have been the same
winner or loser any man who could
stand up against such grueling punish-
ment for twenty-six rounds was entitled
to their respect

  they were willing to make manifest
their admiration of the young mans


top-notch magazine

gameness by abandoning the boycott
which had caused him so much wretch-
edness but they could not forget that
he was mike harveys son-could not
help feeling some prejudice against him
still because his father had been at the
head of the corrupt concern which had
imperiled their lives by supplying them
with worthless equipment

  it was not until a month after his
fight with donovan that larry by a sin-
gle brave act managed to regain the
full measure of his popularity with his
comrades and caused press and public
to sing his praises

  it was at a six-story factory-building
fire that larry thus distinguished him-
self

  the flames had started on the fist
floor and shooting up the stairway had
taken hold of the entire building so
rapidly that every window was belch-
ing flame and thick black smoke when
the boys of larrys company arrived
with the engine

  up the extension ladder which was
quickly raised against a third-story win-
dow larry and his comrades swarmed
they entered the inferno which was
raging inside that window and for
twenty minutes waged a gallant fight
against the fierce flames

  then the officer in command glanc-
ing up at the fire-swept ceiling saw
something which caused him to give his
men a hurried order to retreat-to re-
gain the extension ladder with as little
delay as possible if they set any value
upon their lives

  ah but one member of the company
obeyed that order he did not hear it
and remained with the pipe in his hands
after his comrades had fled

  a few seconds later there came a
thundering crash the ceiling above him
gave way and a mass of burning beams
tumbled upon him

  then the third floor-the floor on
which he was standing-gave way too
and the unfortunate man fell with the
avalanche of debris to the story below
where he was pinned beneath a huge
pile of burning timbers plaster and
brick

  when his comrades returned to res-

cue him they found that only the fact
that one big beam stretched across his
body had fallen in such a position that
it supported the entire mass of wreck-
age had prevented his life from being
crushed out instantly he was lying
under a sort of protecting arch made
by the peculiar position of the beam

  chief forbes who had been brought
to the fire by the turning in of a third
alarm was quick to realize that the sav-
ing of the mans life depended upon im-
mediate action

  unless he was extricated from hig
perilous position at once he would be
roasted to death for tongues of flame
were already licking their way through
the pile of debris and stretching toward
him like the tongues of wild beasts

  and any minute another one of the
upper floors might fall through and
smother him beneath a mass of plaster
and woodwork for there was not much
breathing space as it was in the tiny
tunnel in which he was lying

  there is only one way of getting
him out alive declared chief forbes
grimly somebody has got to crawl
under that beam and saw away that
part of it which is lying across his
stomach

  then he added still more grimly it
may mean the life of the man who tries
it from the position in which that
beam is lying i am afraid that if it is
disturbed the whole mass it supports
will come down that means that both
men beneath it will be crushed to death
still its the only chance of saving that
fellows life who wants to run the
risk

  several men stepped forward and sa-
luted one of them was larry harvey

  chief he cried huskily let me do
it i am mike harveys son

  forbes stared at him in silence for a
brief second then he nodded and
said gruffly all right my boy go to
it

  the other men gasped as larry saw
in hand began to crawl through that
narrow tunnel of burning wreckage to-
ward his imprisoned comrade

  they realized the nobility as well as
the bravery of his act for the man
the fire fighter



pinned under the pile of wreckage the
man for whom larry harvey was tak-
ing a hundred-to-one chance on his life
was-bull donovan

  breathlessly they waited while fire-
man flarvey slowly sawed through the
thick beam which was lying across
donovans middle

  tensely they wondered what would
happen when the work was done and
the big pile of debris was robbed of its
chief support

  it seemed to them scarcely possible
that either fireman harvey or fireman
donovan could come out alive

  but to their great joy and relief
when the big beam parted under the last
stroke of larrys saw the mass of
smoking wreckage did not settle down
upon the imperiled men it held up
long enough for them to drag both
larry and donovan to safety

  then one of the smoke-eaters-the
grime on his face streaked with sweat-
shouted excitedly

  three cheers for larry harvey-the
bravest man nd the best fellow in the
department

  and in the great shout which fol-
lowed the voice of chief forbes was
louder than all the rest

the greatest reward

	arry received the bennett medal
as a reward for his heroism and
the fire commissioner shook his hand
and told him that he wished to apolo-
gize for once having called him a cow-
ard

  larry was very proud of the medal
of course but nevertheless he did not
keep it the day after it was presented
to him tom brooks discovered that his
sister florence was wearing it

  where did you get it sis  he asked
with a broad grin did larry loan it
to you 

  larry gave it to me she answered
writh a blush he gave me this too
she added holding up her left hand
and displaying a big diamond which
glittered on its third finger

  why thats the diamond ring which
the boys presented to fireman harvey
as a mark of their esteem and regard
cried tom with pretended indignation
hes got an awful nerve to give that
away

  i guess the boys wont mind re-
plied florence larry says that dia-
mond rings dont look well on a fire-
mans hand he thinks that they look
much better on the hand of a firemans
wife

  so youre going to marry him are
you sis chuckled tom this is in-
deed a surprise i thought for sure
that you were going to become mrs
ponovan

  dont be silly tom she cried in-
dignantly but talking about poor
bull i was awfully glad to hear that he
chipped in with the rest of the boys to
buy that presentation ring for larry it
shows that theres some good in him
after all

  oh donovans all right now de-
clared tom brooks hes a changed
man since that fire he and larry are
good friends he was the first of us
to congratulate larry when the jury ac-
quitted his father of criminal intent in
selling that rotten hose to the city

  then tom broke into another chuckle
so youre going to marry fireman
harvey-plain fireman harvey-are
you sis i thought you said you
wouldnt be the wife of any member of
the department under the rank of lieu-
tenant 

  im going to be the wife of a bat-
talion chief sir retorted florence con-
fidently larry is bound to get there
in time i shouldnt be at all surprised
to see him in chief forbes place some
day

steadying tanks for ocean liners

schemes galore have been devised to water flows freely from one tank to

prevent seasickness but now we have	the other as the ship rolls to and fro

some ships which carry their own waves	but if the valves are closed the water in

these miniature waves are contained in	the tanks remains stationary since it has

a pair of tanks located on the starboard
and port sides of the ship and connected
by a pipe laid under the deck

  air pipes connect the tanks at the
top and these pipes are fitted with
valves when the valves are open the

the pressure of the air in the tanks to
contend with

  the reason a ship provided with anti-
rolling tanks is steadier than one not so
provided is that the waves of the ocean
are long in dimension and in time

whereas the miniature waves set up in
the tanks are short since the time of
the two sets of waves is different the
action of the tank waves opposes the
action of the sea waves to such an ex-
tent that the ship rides the sea steadily
as the accompanying diagram indicates

  travelers who have crossed the ocean
on ships already provided with these
tanks say that the steadiness almost
precludes the possibility of seasickness

a portable electric fountain

  the construction of this
fountain is extremely simple
and consequently it is not
likely to get out of order the
mechanism consists of an
electric motor attached to a
centrifugal pump the latter
is placed in the interior of a
metal basin the pump gets
the water directly from the
basin and conveys it through
the pipes to a number of noz-
zles which direct small streams over
the dome the water then flows back
into the basin to be used over again

by the pump the dome is revolved
by a single jet from below thus doing
away with complicated devices

  the portable electric fountain em-
bodies all the beautiful effects that the
combination of colored glass flowing
water and electric light can produce
either alone or in combination with

table decorations of ferns and flowers
it may be used to advantage not only
on account of its beauty but also for
the soothing effect of softly falling
water and ever-changing colors

  the tune-a-phone is the invention of
mr miles bryant and makes piano
tuning at once simple practical and sci-

entific it is an instrument provided
with a set of reeds which represent the

in which the reeds are placed is a brass
resonator the reeds develop sound
when the tuner blows into the mouth-

in the ear tubes

 the tune-a-phone is attached to the

electrical music

at last the realization of bellamys new kind of music generated and dis-
tinguished by alternating-current dyna-
mos is the invention of doctor thad-
deus cahill

  electric music is produced at a cen-
tral station like electric light
and distributed like the latter
to a thousand or more hotels
clubs and homes in each of
which music is heard as if the
performers were present in
the room

   the apparatus is electrical
the music is electrical every-
thing except the sounds pro-
duced is electrical

  the music the cahill ma-
chine renders in a hotel or
parlor is not the whisper of
the telephone or the sound of
the graphophone but pure
clear notes and chords as loud
as if an orchestra were on the
spot

color photography

  to frederick e ives an
american inventor is due the
credit of having been the first
to obtain photographs in the
colors of nature this he
does with a special camera
and an apparatus called a
kromskop in this system
three negatives of the same
object are made the first
through red glass the second
through green glass and the
third through blue glass

from these negatives three
positives are made on glass these are

not colored but are merely records of
color

  the kromskop is fitted with viewing

lenses like a stereoscope and is so ar-
ranged that the three positives can be
viewed simultaneously a red glass is
over the first- a green glass over the
second and a blue glass over the third
in the order in which they were photo-
graphed

  the pictures are then viewed through
the kromskop and so perfectly are the
colors brought out that all suggestion
of photography vanishes and the ob-
ject itself be it fruit flowers portrait
or landscape seems to stand before the
eyes again with every quality of color
texture atmosphere and solidity

  as the graphophone disk must be
placed in a graphophone before the
recorded sounds can be reproduced
and the biograph film must pass
through the biograph to reproduce the
moving scenes so the kromgren must
be placed in a kromskop to reproduce
an object in natural colors
how to use a file

isi

i

   to use a file may seem a very simple
matter but there are few operations
more difficult than that of filing well
unlike the bit fixed in the plane whose
movement is
guided by
an unyielding
block the file
must be guid-
ed by hand
and the skill
with which
this is done de-
pends largely
upon patience
and persever-
ance

 while a
good file is
necessary to se-
cure the best
results in fil-
ing knowledge
as to the selec-
t i o n of the
proper file for
the work in
hand and skill-
fulness and
practice in
handling it are
equally essen-
tial

   before using
a file it should first of all be fitted
with a proper handle not as is too
often the case by driving the handle
halfway down upon the tang and

rasp bastard

rasp smooth

single cut coarse

double cut bastard single cut bastard

common varities op files

 thereby doubling the chances of break-
 ing it but by forcing it well up to the
 shoulder some of the file handles
 found on the market will not stand this

               amount of
               driving with-
               o u t splitting
               in such cases
               the tang of an
               old or worn-
               out file of sim-
               ilar dimensions
               should be heat-
               ed taking care
               of course not
               to cl r a w the
               temper a  d
               the hole in the
               handle burned
               out to nearly
               the desired
               size and shape
               before driving
               it up the tang
               it often hap-
               pens that the
               tang hole is not
               drilled central-
               ly or that it is
               badly out of
               line this may
               also be cor-
               rected by using
               a heated tang
               in using large files which are in-
               tended to be operated by both hands the
               handle should be grasped in such a man-
               ner that its end will fit into and bring

double cut smooth single cut smooth
in your own shop

up against the fleshy part of the palm
below the joint of the little finger with
the thumb lying along the top of the
handle in the direction of its length the
ends of the fingers pointing upward or
nearly in the direction of the operators
face

  the point of the file should be
grasped by the thumb and first two fin-
gers the hand being so held as to bring
the thumb as the ball presses on the top
of the file in a line with the handle
when heavy strokes are required when
a light stroke is desired and the pres-
sure demanded becomes less thumb and
fingers may change their direction until
the thumb lies at a right angle or nearly
so with the length of the file

  in holding the file with one hand as
is often necessary in filing light work
the handle should be grasped as already
described with the exception that the
hand should be turned a quarter turn
bringing the forefinger on top and lying
along the handle nearly in the direction
of its length in this position the
least action of the hand and wrist may
be had upon light work

  amateurs will find that by following
these directions the movements of the
file will be simplified and made some-
what easier than if grasped at random
and without consideration

  the accompanying illustration will aid
the amateur mechanic in the selection of
fine and coarse files for special work

a perfect rubbish burner

  the use of the burner here described
for the disposal of waste paper and all
kinds of rubbish that accumulates about

your house office or store is most
highly commended by fire-insurance
companies

  a very large proportion of the disas-
trous fires are caused by burning rub-
bish in the open or by overheating
stoves and their pipes in attempting to
burn waste paper in the house

  to make a rubbish burner procure
three lengths of flat bar iron of an
inch in width  of an inch thick and
 inches long these are for the sup-
ports the hoops of which there are
four may be of almost any diameter
but preferably about  or  inches
they may be made of strap iron or old
iron barrel hoops may be used the

rubbish burner

hoops are riveted to the iron supports
around this skeleton cage rivet or
otherwise fasten a length of wire net-
ting of any available kind the heavier
the better

  a bottom of wire netting must also
be cut to fit and either riveted to the
lower hoop or bound to it with heavy
iron wire a top of wire netting with
an iron handle completes the burner

  into this fireproof basket the rub-
bish is put sprinkled with kerosene and
burned and the wire keeps ashes and
glowing embers from blowing about the
neighborhood and setting fire to inflam-
able matter

the man of mystery

j ixty thousand enthusiastic
souls surrounded the historic
gridiron of the polo grounds
-sixty thousand tense
straining atoms of humanity
whose every nerve and fiber throbbed
and stilled as the pigskin zigzagged
over the trampled field alternate
waves of color surged over the crowd-
ed stands while the air was rent with
rival cries to the twenty-two struggling
heaving athletes whose very life seemed
to depend upon the outcome

  to the teams the stands were but a
blur of orange and black or blue and
white and the cheers came as the muf-
fled roar of speeding trains to the ears
strained to catch the quickly snapped
signals the score stood a blank for
each side with five minutes more to
play the ball was nearly in the mid-
dle of the field and the teams were
lined up for the last scrimmage

  something of the intensity of the
situation seemed to communicate itself
to the spectators for the stands were
stilled the rival flags were lowered
the bands were silent the crisp air had
lost all life and even the miniati re
spectators silhouetted high on the sky
line of the rocky cliffs of harlem
seemed to brace themselves for the last
rush

  then it was that phillip our captain

stooped to tie his shoe and at the same
time called larinski and me to him
back of the line a few crisp words
were all he had time to speak before the
shrill whistle of the umpire sounded
play

  the time had come for the supreme
test phillip the sturdy quarter trotted
to his place behind the stalwart center
larinski and i the halves dug our
cleated heels into the trampled ground
and strained forward silence-the si-
lence of the dead everywhere

  i remember thinking how cold it was
and being intensely annoyed by the
clang of some distant cable gong then
came one short word from the crouch-
ing quarter back no string of signal
numbers no intricate cipher but just
one fiercely hissed word  now

  what followed is scarcely clear to
me even when i have had years in
which to think it over at that word
i sprang forward phillip jammedthe
ball into my side and i crouching
clasped my arms around it in a fierce
hug then i seemed to strike a seeth-
ing yet solid wall of moleskin jackets
and padded legs

  i heard larinskis tense voice in my
ear felt him drag the ball from its
place against my breast and caught one
fleeting glimpse of his streaming hair
as he darted back out of the crush in
a wide sweeping circle and tore across
the field

  then i went down smothered under
by the kings favor



the human blanket when i recovered
consciousness in the dressing room the
game was over and won and larinski
the best half back of many seasons
-dear old count larinski my class-
mate and chum the one man of mys-
tery in the class-was again the hero
of our college world

  we were graduated the following
june and with the first keen sorrow
that comes to mans estate bade fare-
well to our alma mater and the class-
mates whose lives for our short college
years had been woven together into a
fabric that covered the dearest and best
years of each of us

  the class scattered to the four quar-
ters of the globe and gradually as the
years passed our meetings became
ewer and more infrequent

  shortly after graduation i was ap-
pointed a second lieutenant in the regu-
lar  cavalry in the years of service
with my regiment on the plains and in
the island possessions i was completely
cut off from college friends

  i knew that larinski had gone back
to his continental home in the little
kingdom of walsach and the title of
count which we had lovingly be-
stowed upon him at college was in
fact nearer the truth than the familiar
names of the undergraduates usually
come

  in fact in a vagabond copy of a
paris newspaper that drifted months
late into my quarters in the philip-
pines i had seen mention of the doings
of a certain prince fritz larinski and
i concluded that it was my old friend

  shortly after receiving my captaincy
i had the good fortune to be ordered as
military attache with our embassy to
one of the great continental powers
the duties were nominal but my field
of observation covered the smaller king-
doms and dependencies of the great
state to which i was accredited

  thus it was that i journeyed from
my headquarters to the little independ-
ent kingdom of walsach to witness the
great military review attendant upon
the coronation of the new sovereign
king frederick xii in his capitol at
litchburg

a

  even at the imperial court we had
heard mutterings of intrigue and dis-
satisfaction in the far-away little state
but as such matters concerned only
the imperial chancellor i paid little
heed to them and set out on my jour-
ney in happy anticipation of witnessing
a brilliant military spectacle and being
back in time for the next state ball at
the palace

  i arrived at litchburg the day be-
fore the ceremony attending the coro-
nation and after presenting my cre-
dentials was assigned a place with the
staff of the commanding general where
i would be able to witness the review
that preceded the new kings march
into the city at the head of his troops
this was a time-honored custom that
had preceded the coronation of the
hereditary rulers of walsach since the
medieval days when no king was sure
of his throne without his army at his
back

chapter ii

a pretty conspiracy

thus it was that on the morning of

	the coronation i rode with gen-
eral von zurich and his glittering staff
to the great plain outside the city where
were assembled the fighting men of
walsach

  i was surprised to notice as i rode
with the numerous oificers of rank and
their aids that there seemed to be some
sort of unrest in the air a nervous
tension had gripped the entire staff and
the furtive glances and strained si-
lences were hardly explained by the re-
mark of the young captain who rode
with me that his majesty was scarcely
known to the army having been edu-
cated abroad and having spent most of
the later years in travel

  in fact added my companion it
is no secret that colonel prince ulrich
who commands the cavalry of the guard
would be much more acceptable to at
least a portion of the army than the
rightful heir

  my friend the captain spoke to me
in english and i answered him in the
same language though i was con-


top-notch magazine

versant with german which was with
slight modifications the language of
w alsach

  however as i had spoken only eng-
lish i presume i was not credited with
any other tongue else i was consid-
ered of little importance in the affairs
of the moment for i caught from time
to time snatches of conversation that
told me all was not well with the new
king for instance i heard one griz-
zled colonel mutter through his droop-
ing mustache to a savage-looking offi-
cer of mountain artillery

  we can thank heaven my comrade
if a coronation is all we witness to-
day

  but the growled reply amazed me
still more

  you and i have been good com-
rades old friend but if that dog ulrich
raises his hand and you stand by him
we will for once be on opposite sides
i served the kings father and ill serve
the king or die for him and if as ru-
mored ulrich means treachery to-day
ive a thousand men of the crags to
stand by the son of my old commander

  ulrichs plan i have heard is to
wheel out of line as he passes in re-
view with his horsemen sweep the staff
off its feet capture or kill the king
and with what of the army will follow
him ride to the city and proclaim him-
self

  its the wild scheme of a wilder
man but hell not be able to carry it
out even with these doddering old
women in command there are ten
thousand troops here and while ul-
richs horse may be disaffected id
stake my life on the infantry and moun-
tain guns if it were not that ulrich
is of the royal blood and hand in glove
with that old snake von hess hed he
out of the country long ago

  this and more of the same tenor i
heard in low-voiced conversation as we
rode out to our position and it oc-
curred to me that the poor king was
not so sure of his crown after all it
seemed that i was likely to witness
more perhaps than the ceremony of a
coronation parade

  as we reached our position in the

middle of the plain i caught a still
more significant scrap of talk this
time it was between two young captains
one of them a hussar quietly drew
from under his tunic a cavalry revolver
and holding it as nearly as possible out
of sight reassured himself that it was
loaded then he nervously  whispered
to his companion a captain of lancers

  we may need these if that old fox
ulrich carries out his plan remember
adolph when the guards charge us we
are to keep every one away from the
king until eckstein and his men have
surrounded him then our part is
done and king ulrichs reward is a
colonelcy for us both and for you a
title in addition

  indeed i felt sorry for his majesty
frederick xii for here was a full-
fledged conspiracy to deprive him of
his crown before it was placed on his
head i mentally resolved to be well
out of the wray when ulrich and his
horsemen galloped into our ranks i
had no desire to sacrifice myself under
the hoofs of the guards powerful
horses in a scrimmage for a puppet
throne in which i had no interest

  general von zurichs party took sta-
tion on a little hit of raised ground over
which floated the royal standard and a
few minutes later the trumpets blared
forth a flourish as the king galloped to-
ward us at the head of his suite he
had come on the field from the oppo-
site direction from his castle at elf-
stein where he had spent the last few
days in preparation for his coronation

  we were drawn up in a rigid line
and sat with hands at salute as his
majesty rode up there was some-
thing familiar in the appearance and
manner of the new king despite his
glittering uniform and the silver helmet
that shaded his eyes for a moment i
puzzled my brain to think where i had
seen a picture of the crown prince of
walsach

  then of a sudden it came to me i
had never seen his picture but i had
seen the original many many times i
had seen those same fearless blue eyes
glance quickly up and down the strain-
ing line of moleskin backs searching
by the kings favor



for an opening between a guard and
tackle i had seen that same head
crowned not with a silver helmet but
with a leather head guard and i had
seen that straight aristocratic nose plow
up yards of mud under the feet of a
struggling football team

  yes and i had helped push his
majestys sacred body over under and
through a heaving bucking line of col-
lege athletes for a two-yard gain that
meant as much to us in those days as
did a kingdom now

  no doubt about it there was the
scar in the left cheek made by bra-
hams heel in the yale game during our
junior year so i had met my class-
mate again and his majesty frederick
xii of walsach was count la-
rinski the best half back that ever
wore the orange and black of old
nassau

chapter iii

before his majesty

i think i muttered well ill be
 hanged for a dignified officer be-
side me said pardon herr captain
in a surprised and injured voice but i
paid little heed to him or anything else
my mind was working faster than it
had ever gone since the days when i
would try to bluff through a greek
recitation by making the professor
think i was thoroughly familiar with a
passage i had never seen before

  and i had plenty to think about too
here was my old chum count la-
rinski the hereditary monarch of wal-
sach come to his coronation and over
there across the field was one ulrich
who it was pretty certain was con-
spiring to steal the crown if not to take
the life of his cousin king

  it was of course impossible for me
to speak to his majesty and warn him
of what a pleasant surprise his dear
cousin had planned for him so i sat
and thought until a wild scheme born
of i know not of what madness en-
tered my head

  the troops were being aligned pre-
paratory to the march past and i acted
without heed of the consequences to

myself something had to be done to
keep ulrich from leading his men in
front of the reviewing party and i took
the first course that occurred to me

  i gradually edged my mount away
from my place in the line until i was
well clear of the group then reach-
ing my foot well under the belly of the
horse i twisted my heavily roweled
cavalry spur under the girth and gave
the poor beast dig after dig

  with a frightened snort the animal
leaped forward and in a moment was
out across the plain in a mad flight
but i had a steady hand on the rein
and guided the maddened brute straight
for the center of the line of the fa-
mous guard regiment where on his
powerful black sat the traitor ulrich
he saw me coming and like every one
else thought i had lost control of my
mount but i had not kicked my spur
free of the girth and had my horse well
in hand

  ulrich anticipated a collision for i
rode straight at him and he endeav-
ored to avoid me but good horseman
that he was i managed to range close
alongside and as i flashed past i
struck him a stinging blow in the face
with my open hand

  i was gone in a second but i heard
the hiss of his saber as he swung a vi-
cious back cut at me and as i raced my
horse back to where the red and gold
of the royal standard fluttered above
the knoll i could hear the pounding of
his horses hoofs in pursuit

  i was thinking rapidly as i tore along
across the smooth parade in truth my
position was hardly an agreeable one
for an american army officer to be in
i had come as the representative of a
friendly power to witness the corona-
tion of a king hearing rumors of a
plot to assassinate that king and with-
out warrant other than the love i bore
an old-time college mate i had inter-
fered in affairs of state that did not
concern me i had grossly insulted the
kings  cousin and was now flying for
my life to the protection of a man who
might resent my interference in his pri-
vate affairs

  as i leaned low over my speeding


top-notch magazine

horses neck i caught a glimpse of a
horseman galloping at full speed diag-
onally across the plain in front of me
i recognized the artillery colonel whom
i had heard speak of his mountaineers
on the way to the review

  then i glanced back over my shoul-
der where twenty yards behind i
could see the wrathful face of prince
ulrich and on his right cheek flamed
the blood-red stigma of my insult

  farther back stood the cavalry of the
guard their alignment was not so
perfect now and there seemed to be
some confusion among the officers but
there had been no general movement

  i learned afterward that my blow
had been struck so quickly that it had
not been seen and the regiment was in
doubt as to what course to pursue
thinking that perhaps i had brought
some urgent message to the prince that
had caused him to change his plans
and seek the presence of the king

  i rode straight to the king and pulled
my horse back on his haunches as i
ranged alongside of him then lean-
ing as near to the royal ear as possible
i spoke in the lowest tone that would
carry

  larry old man your majesty for
the love of mike get out of this
theyre going to kill you in about three
minutes im kenyon ninety-four
quick get some troops about you
and-hike-

  by this time ulrich had pulled up
on the other side of the king ap-
parently he did not dare attack me so
near the person of his monarch but i
could hear and see that he was relating
the incident of my unwarranted attack
and demanding instant vengeance

  the glittering staff was thrown into
confusion by our onslaught and had
drawn together in two compact groups
watching our little drama in their midst

  at length the king raised his hand
and the prince ceased his tirade then
the two drew a little apart and con-
tinued to converse

  far off across the parade i heard a
bugle call and a minute later my old
friend the colonel of artillery galloped

toward us followed by two mule bat-
teries of mountain guns apparently
he was the only one there besides the
king who was in complete control of
his faculties for without waiting for
an order he swung his artillerymen
into a hollow square around our agi-
tated group and i could see his wiry
brown gunners skipping about like
monkeys as they assembled their guns
into action front and stood by their
ammunition mules it was all done in
a moment and the king of walsach
faced his army from behind a square
of shotted brass field pieces

  then i saw the king extend his hand
to ulrich who bending low in his sad-
dle raised it to his lips then straight-
ening up he saluted wheeled his horse
and rode out of our cannon-walled
square and so back to his regiment

  then the king turned to the generals

  gentlemen he said an unfortu-
nate incident that we will not explain
now has marred the customary loyal
greeting of our troops we will dis-
pense with the remainder of the review
and proceed to the cathedral general
von zurich you will give the order to
form for our entry into the city

  then turning to my friend the artil-
lery colonel his majesty extended his
hand

  colonel zies he said we con-
gratulate you on the excellent maneu-
ver of your batteries they are well
trained sir and you should be proud
of them our escort into the city will
be the blue lancers and your guns
colonel will follow immediately be-
hind

  then to general zurich he contin-
ued 

  the cavalry of the guard at the
request of our cousin prince ulrich
will precede us into the city and will
then be excused from further duty
to-day

  his majesty did not even glance at
me but turning his horse trotted off
toward the right of line and i fell in
with the staff and so rode back to the
city as i had come but there was no
conversation this time to distract my
somewhat turbulent thoughts

rah for princeton 

thus the new king of walsach en-

	tered his ancient city of litch-
burg according to custom at the head
of his army and thus we proceeded to
the cathedral in the great square
there before an immense concourse of
his nobles and his people surrounded
by the high officers of his army and
his court king frederick xii was
crowned by the venerable bishop of
walsach and ascended the throne of
his fathers

  after the ceremony at the cathedral
i rode directly to my hotel where i
proceeded to pack my belongings as i
intended to start on the return journey
to my post the next day after paying
one or two official calls i had no par-
ticular desire to try for an audience
with the king not knowing what policy
he had decided upon toward my wild
behavior at the review that i had
saved him from assassination i felt
sure and i knew that he appreciated
it although for the moment he might
be compelled to keep me at a distance

  i was tired after the somewhat ex-
citing events of the day and was hav-
ing a little dinner in my room when no
less a person than the manager of the
hotel appeared closely followed by a
young officer in the fatigue uniform of
the royal staff

  this gentleman was introduced by
mine host as captain count von
shroeder who had come on urgent
business hence the intrusion which it
was hoped i would overlook consid-
ering the importance of the matter in
hand thus speaking the smooth-
tongued boniface bowed himself out
and i was left alone with my visitor

  von shroeder was a handsome well-
built chap who spoke english per-
fectly and in spite of the slight em-
barrassment natural under the circum-
stances came straight to the point

  captain kenyon he began taking
the chair i offered him i am sent by
his majesty the king to request you to
come to the palace as soon as possible
his majesty has told me that you are

old friends and he is very eager to see
you you can come just as you are as
his majesty will see you in his private
apartments quite unofficially of course
i have a carriage waiting so if you find
it convenient we will start at once

  my packing was about finished and
as i was off the next day i was more
than delighted with the chance of again
seeing old count larinski especially
where we could talk over old times in
quiet so i was ready in a jiffy and
my guide and i drove rapidly through
the illuminated streets where the crowd
of merrymakers were beginning to be-
come hilarious

  our carriage stopped at a little side
gate in the wall of the palace grounds
and von shroeder led the way up a
garden path to a small door in the rear
of the building through this we
passed to a long corridor at the end of
which we ascended a flight of steps
and finally brought up before the door
of the kings private apartments

  here von shroeder left me for a
moment to stare at a silent stony-faced
sentry while he passed inside he was
back again in a minute however and
motioned me to enter i passed into a
sort of library and there in a dressing
gown stretched at full length on a
leather-covered divan lay the dear old
count he sprang up as i entered
and with a smile on his tired face al-
most leaped across the room to clasp
me in his arms

  good old kennie cried his maj-
esty of walsach slapping me on the
back with a mighty thump good old
kennie  by jove after all these years 
and to turn up here just in time to pull
me out of a hole too gad boy its
like old times sit down and tell me all
about it say i feel like sending my
people out to collect wood for a fresh-
man fire rah for princeton and
again the mighty hafid almost thumped
the wind out of me

  larinski shoved me into a chair and
thrust a pipe into my hand

  there said he that looks like old
times in witherspoon but say that
was a great run you made to-day and
hang me if i dont think your touch-

down won the game cousin ulrich
must feel to-night like a championship
team that loses on a fluke

  we sat far into the night smoking
our pipes and talking of many things
we went over the old old days of
freshman year the victories and defeats
on the gridiron the escapades of col-
lege days and the work of after years
and finally as the hour grew late he
talked frankly of the present and then
of the future

  his majesty was far from being se-
curely seated on his throne although
the world did not know there were
many intrigues within and without his
small kingdom and over all was the
shadow of the great poaver his neigh-
bor which was the final arbiter of the
fortunes of the little states that clus-
tered about her

  the early morning hours found us
still discussing affairs of state and the
king insisted that i remain the rest of
the night in the palace

  just before i was shown to my room
larry made a proposal to me that had
the effect of keeping me tossing about
wide awake on my bed for the few
hours that yet remained of the night
it was no less than an offer of a
colonelcy in his army with a snug com-
petency for life if i would resign from
the service of my own country and en-
ter that of walsach

  it was a hard nut to crack but the
innate love of adventure that had sent
me into the army in the first place con-
quered and by morning i had decided

chapter v

enter an angel

at breakfast his majesty and i con-
cocted numerous telegrams which
were intrusted to a secretary to for-
ward to my embassy to the state and
war departments at washington and
one signed by the king himself to the
president of the united states

  there that ought to settle things
said larry pushing his chair back from
the desk after signing the last of these
messages and now colonel kenyon
it but remains for us to send for your

traps get you a new uniform move you
into the palace and you are a full-
fledged aid-de-camp in waiting to his
majesty the king of walsach hows
that from a captain of u s cavalry
to a colonel on the staff of a king in one
jump

  so it happened that within a week of
my first entry into the little kingdom of
walsach i had ceased to be an officer
of the united states army and ap-
peared at the grand coronation ball in
the glittering uniform of a colonel of
the blue lancers the regiment i had the
honor to command when not detailed
for duty on his majestys staff

  of my friend prince ulrfch whose
little coup i had balked at the review
by drawing him away from his men
and leaving the conspiracy without a
leader at the crucial moment i saw but
little of course we were both present
at the usual state functions that fol-
lowed the coronation but i studiously
avoided him at the end of a week or
so he withdrew from court and retired
to his estates in the hills of baratavia
for his health as was published in
the court gazette

  the king to all outward apearances
was now firmly seated on his throne
and life at court was beginning to set-
tle down we did not lack for amuse-
ment for his majesty was a keen
sportsman and we varied the excite-
ment of the chase with tennis and long
rides about the beautiful hills that
ringed litchburg

  one morning after an unusually
tedious state function that kept me in
attendance on the king rather later than
was customary i awoke early and
feeling the need of exercise and fresh
air to brush the cobwebs from my
brain i sent for my horse and pre-
pared to ride off the devils of the
nights dissipation

  with no particular object in view ex-
cept a good hard gallop i cantered
through the old north gate of the city
and out along the highway that led
away to the hamlet of zuyden in the
foothills of baratavia

  finding myself near the delightful
little inn on the first rise beyond the
by the kings favop



village at about the same hour i usually
broke my fast i rode into the cobble-
paved court and dismounting gave
my horse to a stableboy while i in-
terviewed the buxom tavern frau as to
the possibilities of a country breakfast

  my inquiries met with flattering suc-
cess and in a few minutes an immacu-
late table was set out on the porch over-
looking the road that wound away on to
the plain below whence i had come

  the ride had given me an appetite
the air was crisp and invigorating and
the breakfast fit for the gods in
truth the world in which i lived seemed
to border as near paradise that morning
as mortal man can expect to attain and
still keep his eafthly attributes at
least so i fancied as with the vigor of
perfect health i attacked my steaming
breakfast

  and then into the heaven that my
self-content had created drifted the one
thing needful to complete the picture
-an angel yes she was an angel in
very truth as she stood parting the
bushes on the opposite side of the road
with one slim gauntleted hand while
with the other she held her clinging
drab riding habit clear of the ground
showing tife tiniest of feet incased in
polished riding boots

  apparently the angelic vision was
satisfied with her scrutiny of the inn
for she let the dew-dripping bushes fall
behind her and with quick springing
steps crossed the road she was evi-
dently expected for the good house-
wife met her at the steps with a low
curtsy

  ah frau muller a fine morning
for a fine gallop rippled forth my
lady of the woods and im famished
for my glass of milk so please hurry
i came by the long path through the
woods and oh its glorious cupid
is tied to a tree over there and i guess
hell be glad of a rest for i rode him
hard trying to catch the sunbeams that
flittered through the trees always just
ahead of us

  the hostess of the inn disappeared
and a moment later returned with a
glass pitcher foaming with fresh milk
she also carried a deep pewter mug 

  trying to catch the sunbeams i
murmured jove she has caught
them all and tangled them in her hair
and the little wretch has stolen the sil-
very tinkle of the woodland brooks for
her voice and robbed the skies of their
blue for her eyes what  senti-
mental  surely who could have
helped it

  standing with one foot on the low-
est step of the porch the lady raised
the pewter mug high above her head

  prosit frau muller she said
may your cows never cease to fur-
nish you with this most excellent drink
then she tipped back her dainty
head where the clinging drops spar-
kled like diamonds among the wavy
brown curls and i caught a glimpse of
a soft white throat as she drained her
tankard to the last drop

  with a long-drawn breath of satis-
faction the maid handed the empty
mug back and drawing a little gold
purse from her pocket she settled her
score after a few more words she
gathered her habit again in her hand
and tripped back across the road passed
through the bushes and was gone

  i lighted my pipe but did not get
much contentment from it as i sat
blowing the fragrant clouds of smoke
out into the clear air i fancied that
they wove themselves into the form of
the vision of the bushes when i sent
for my horse and paid my bill i in-
quired of the good wife who the ady
was frau muller semed greatly sur-
prised at my question and glanced
keenly at me before she replied
surely you must know the princess
olga sister of his highness prince
ulrich our overlord she lives at her
brothers castle in the hills and comes
here frequently for a glass of our
milk which she declares is the most
delicious in all walsach but you are
not long in the city perhaps and her
highness has been in the hills for the
last two months therefore you do not
know her

  i did not know her of course but
there and then i swore that i would
know her and that too before another
week should pass

  how soon i was to make good and
under what circumstances i did not
know then or i would not have ridden
so gayly back to the city

chapter vi

a find in the woods

hen i reached the palace i found
the king in his library and with
him general zurich and the prime min-
ister old count waldeck and another
little ferretlike man whom i recognized
as the chief of the secret police

  im glad you have come kenyon
said the king as i entered as directed
to do by the usher in waiting who had
informed me that his majesty had in-
quired for me we need your yankee
wit for we seem to be in a pretty ket-
tle of fish here the short of the mat-
ter is that for some time the emperor
has been negotiating with us for the
hand of our cousin the princess olga
he wants to marry her to the grand
duke of holbeck-rauenstein and it
is a most desirable alliance for us from
every point of view but heres the
rub olga is our dear cousin ulrichs
sister and cousin ulrich as you know
does not love us with the cousinly af-
fection that is supposed to exist be-
tween blood relations therefore he
keeps his sister shut up in his castle of
hoffberg in the hills and refuses to
give an answer to our proposals on be-
half of the grand duke

  there you have the situation as it
stands except that the emperor is
growing impatient for an answer and
as you know we cannot afford at this
time to run counter to the wishes of
his imperial majesty what do you
think of the problem my colonel
you are indeed in the dark your
majesty i answered not knowing
the mind of the lady i would suggest
that you forward the whole matter to
her and let her decide it

  oh the ladys mind does not mat-
ter at all answered the king confi-
dently its ulrich we must approach
the lady marries whom she is told and
thats an end of the matter as far as
she is concerned but how to get

around cousin ulrich thats the
point at issue now

   your majesty began the little fer-
ret man there is a way i have posi-
tive information that the prince is plot-
ting with von hess and others for
your overthrow why not arrest them
all  you will have sufficient evidence
to warrant you in exiling his royal
highness and then the princess be-
comes your ward the matter is quite
simple your majesty

  frederick thought this bit of advice
over for some time in silence and then
rejected it with a curt no

   i have a better plan gentlemen he
said ill make peace with cousin
ulrich ill go to him in the hills for-
give him his little slip at the corona-
tion review and lay the matter before
him ulrich is a good fellow at heart
and will see the benefit we are sure to
derive from acceding to the emperors
wishes yes ill waive ceremony and
call on ulrich

  yes and hang it all thought i
youll send my poor little wood nymph
off to marry some dissolute grand duke
or other and that is a matter i do not
care to contemplate however i held
 my peace

  twice during the week in which his
majesty and his ministers perfected
their arrangements for making peace
with ulrich did i ride to the little inn in
the foothills and each time did i gaze
upon the wondrous beauty of the prin-
cess olga

  and then i made a discovery i
found out why i hated the grand duke
of holbeck-rauenstein and why i ut-
terly disapproved of his majestys
reconciliation plan i loved the princess
olga myself that was the interest i
had in the affair and i decided that it
was a bigger interest than the shares
of the emperor the king the prince
and the grand duke combined

  i had been sulking several days as
the result of my reflections on the ways
of kings and had kept aloof from his
majesty perhaps he divined my trou-
ble and understood at any rate he
was considerate enough not to send for
me and i haunted the inn of frau
by the kings favor



muller and so was not informed of
the date of the kings proposed journey
to his cousins castle

  i am not an idle dreamer and i had
not traveled to the village of zuyden
without an object i haunted the path
in the woods that led from opposite
the little inn in a winding course to the
very gate of the old castle and i had
explored its every yard as well as nu-
merous bypaths that intersected the
main bridle road in one of these trips
i picked up a little gold purse with the
arms of walsach marked on the cover
in diamonds no need for me to won-
der who was its owner i knew only
too well and with my treasure safely
stowed in the pocket of my riding coat
i patiently waited for an opportunity to
restore it

  it happened that my chance came
one morning in a clearing in the wood
where i met my lady returning after
her visit to the inn i saw her s she
entered the little bower and made bold
to ride directly toward her as the
path was narrow i reined to one side
and as the princess reached me i
bared my head and spoke to her

  your highness said i i think i
have found something that belongs to
you permit me to return it

  with a glad little cry she reached
over and took the trinket from me
and i nearly fell off my horse when
her highness looking straight at me
said thank you so much colonel
kenyon i thought you never would
find it

  so my lady knew of my meanderings
in the forest and had set a trap for
me also she knew my name the
game was beginning well indeed

  emboldened by the princess gracious
manner i wheeled my horse and rode
beside her down the narrow glade and
we were soon in a merry mood

  of course pouted the princess
frederick and ulrich do not get on
together but that is all going to be
made right to-day for the king is com-
ing to pay us a visit and i am sure
that whatever the trouble is all about it
will be settled they used to be such
good chums in the old kings time

  we chatted gayly as we rode through
the wood until we came to a little rise
in the ground from which we could see
the road that wound away toward the
city far down this road we saw three
horsemen approaching at a sharp can-
ter and as they came nearer the
princess keen eyes recognized the king
and two officers

  at this she gave a little gasp of
fright

  oh i must hurry she cried i
must be at the castle to meet his majes-
ty or ulrich will never forgive me
good-by colonel kenyon and thank
you for a very pleasant ride

  with that she was off through the
woods at a gallop while i sat watching
her until she disappeared then i
turned again toward the road by which
the horsemen were approaching

  in order to see who was with his
majesty i dismounted and tying my
horse pushed through the bushes to get
nearer the road i was standing almost
concealed by the thick underbrush and
tree trunks when my attention was at-
tracted by the noise of some animal
crawling through the brush at some
distance to my left i gazed keenly in
the direction of the sound and to my
amazement saw a man on all fours
crawling toward the edge of the wood

  a moment more and i recognized
prince ulrich he was clad in the
garb of a forester and his right hand
carried a long rifle as he pushed for-
ward as i watched the prince settled
himself behind a fallen tree and de-
liberately loading his piece laid it along
the log and sighted on the road

a kings mercy

 my friend thought i a nice
piece of treachery this youve
invited your dear cousin to visit you
and by the time youve finished him
youll be the head of the family and
the king will be conversing with his
ancestors in the great beyond nice
little game indeed

  i loosened the revolver in the holster
under my jacket and as stealthily as


top-notch magazine

the prince had advanced i crept along
in his wake so intent was he upon
the approaching horsemen that he heard
no sound by the time the king and his
two officers came within range i was
within ten feet of the prince and he
had not once glanced behind

  i saw him slowly shift the muzzle
of his rifle to bring it to bear on the
king and then i sprang forward as
the princes finger pressed the trigger
my foot kicked the barrel of the gun
into the air and the next moment i had
rolled him over on his back and had
the muzzle of my revolver pressed
against his temple

  but in turn my wrist was gripped
and a voice broke in let him get
up sir ive got his gun it was only
loaded with a dummy cartridge any-
way i bribed his head keeper and
looked out for that

  in amazement i looked up it was
the ferret man who stood leaning on
the princes gun looking down as in-
scrutable as the sphinx then the king
leaped the ditch at the edge of the
wood and followed by his two ad-
jutants heinz and uhlman came up
to us

  his majesty motioned us all to with-
draw and raising his cousin to his
feet linked his arm in that of the
rwould-be assassin and walked a little
way into the wood i noticed that the
ferret kept the prince covered with a
revolver during the whole of the con-
versation which lasted some twenty
minutes but this the king did not see

  when the cousins came back to us
the king spoke in a quieter voice than
i had ever heard him use -

  gentlemen my cousin is not at all
well he has been suffering from a
serious mental disorder for some time
and is now going to travel abroad until
he is cured what you have witnessed
to-day was merely one phase of the
malady and here his majestys voice
became cold and hard as steel it is
my desire my command that each one
of you wipe what you have seen from
your memory our cousin leaves
walsach to-morrow morning for paris
to consult a specialist he may never

come back and by your loyalty to me i
again command you to forget what you
have seen if this incident becomes
public i shall know where to look for
the traitor

  then turning to the princess olga
who had now approached

  come cousin olga he said you
will ride back to litchburg with me
we have long needed a womans hand
in our affairs at the palace your lug-
gage will be sent on by your women at
once

  then turning to us where we stood
at attention listening wide-eyed to this
exhibition of a kings mercy gentle-
men you may not see his highness
prince ulrich again i bid you salute
the cousin and friend of the king

  our hands snapped to the visors of
our caps in military salute prince
ulrich as stiffly returned it wheeled on
his heel and walked off through tha
forest and ten yards behind him went
the ferret with a hand suspiciously
near his hip pocket

  the next day her highness luggage
and maids arrived at the palace and it
was announced in the official gazette
that his highness prince ulrich had
gone to paris to consult an eminent
specialist concerning a malady that
threatened to deprive the kingdom of
one of its stanchest props

  the same issue contained the infor-
mation that his majesty by virtue of the
right vested in him the hereditary
ruler of walsach by the imperial grant
of  had for eminent services to
the crown created reginald kenyon
a prince of the kingdom and had con-
ferred on him the title and estates of
elfstein

  there is another copy of the official
gazette of the kingdom of walsach that
i love to read over and over again it
is of a date a year later than that an-
nouncing the departure of prince ul-
rich for paris

  under the heading court news is
this item

  his majesty announces the be-
trothal of her highness the princess
olga marie beatrice to his highness

the open door

here were very few people
 in the car in which the girl
 in shabby blue serge sat she
 looked tired and sat deject-
 edly limp and still clutching
 a bulging envelope from which some
 typewritten matter protruded

  opposite her was a tall thin elderly
man in an opulent-looking fur over-
coat whose glance strayed ever and
again to her pale face with the gray
eyes set darkly like shadowed lakes
in it

 the subway train stopped with a
jerk at the fourteenth street station
and she dropped her envelope on the
floor a few people got out

  allow me said the man opposite
stooping for the envelope

  his keen eyes took in the evident
nature of the contents as he handed it
back and he studied her more atten-
tively and very kindly she uttered a
brief word of thanks and sat mute
again the train rumbled on

  he hesitated seeming to be making
up his mind to speak in a moment
he bent forward and asked

  may i take that seat by you and
may i speak to you 

  the girl started flushed and stam-
mered opening great gray eyes half
resentfully he did not wait for per-
mission but took the seat by her

  i shall be getting out soon he said
and before i do i want to ask if you
have not perhaps one or two manu-
scripts in that envelope which you have
been trying not very successfully to
sell will you forgive this apparent
impertinence of mine

  i hardly know-what to say re-
plied the girl

  time is short he said you have
manuscripts there havent you now
you see i know the woes and strug-
gles and difficulties of a young authors
life pretty well but where there is
merit it should meet with success and
-i hardly know how to put it without
appearing impertinent-your face ar-
rested my attention just now

  it was said so quietly courteously
and above all so kindly that it was
not possible to take the statement as im-
pertinence she looked back at him
regaining her breath after the amaze-
ment

  he handed her a card she read it
silently to herself

top-notch magazine

 you know me he asked whim-
sically watching her face

  tm afraid-not

  he explained smiling kindly

  well the only interest i should
have for you miss-miss--

  she hesitated and then said char-
ters

  thank you well the only interest
i should have for you miss charters
lies in the fact that i am one of the
directors of the eastern magazine
company limited

  her chfeeks flushed brilliantly and
she stared at him catching her breath

  you are-he was taking in unob-
trusively the poverty of her shabby cos-
tume--an author are you not

  its my living said the girl rather
shakily

  not a very good one at present
miss charters

  very poor she said hurriedly
very very poor its so difficult to
get a start your own magazines-i
mean your companys magazines-for
instance are horribly exclusive some
editors wont read things at all and
some delay in replying and some when
they accept hold up ones work for
months and one has to wait for pay-
ment-

  he interrupted

  i know but if you find editors
rather inaccessible at times you must
remember they really have to protect
themselves against what would be a
regular invasion of useless authors
the point now is-time is flying-will
you grant me a glimpse of one of those
stories 

  she handed him one and he ran his
eye hastily down the first page or two

  she sat watching his face breath-
lessly

  a word or two of commendation es-
caped him presently thrilling her hope
ran high she clasped and unclasped
her little shabbily gloved hands on her
blue-serge lap he skimmed and
slipped over to the last page and
turned to her

  a fine ending that he said with
frank approbation very fine i wasnt
deceived in your face just now youve

got power youve got insight and
youve got grit you show all that in
a story whose shortness gives you little
scope for it besides a very good plot
now i want to suggest that you send
that story at once to the gilt edge
monthly

  her face fell a little

  the gilt edge monthly oh but

thats-

  the most difficult of all our maga-
zines to gain access to he flushed

  then he took out pencil and note-
book

  but i will write a note now to the
editor recommending you to him
which you can inclose with the story
he explained im going away my-
self  i sail to-morrow for cannes my
doctors insist that i winter abroad but
i can do this much for you anyway
how can i thank you she began
i dont want thanks he replied
penciling vigqjously im only too
pleased to discover you and i hope
my friend the editor will agree with
me as to the merit of that story any-
way send this in with your story

  he handed her the note read it
  she read

  dear fen i have just met this young
author who i believe shows great promise
i hope youll agree with me that this is a
rattling fine story and if you can arrange

whispered ecstatically her eyes shining

white cheeks
mightier than the sword



  the train rumbled in to the seventy-
second street station

said

as they ascended the stairs

  yes i have a-a room-near co-
lumbus avenue

  yes oh well why not lots of
people must-and do you know

  she stammered a little under the kind
interest in his eyes

  i hope cannes will do you good
she said putting out her hand

  thanks miss charters good-by
and good luck to you

  a dear little girl he said to him-
self as he hailed a taxi and a clever
little girl i dont suppose i need write
fenn further on the matter when i
come back ill remember to inquire

 chapter ii

the transfer

cue charters entered her room
 on the fourth floor and sat down
to take breath her great eyes danced
her heart sang her fingers fluttered
trembling about the manuscript and
that slip of magic paper on which an
open sesame was written plain for all
to see

  its come she said aloud its
come the gates unlatched and i can
go in what a splendid piece of luck
ill go round and leave the story to-
morrow

  her eye fell on an illuminated card
pinned to the wall above the mantel
the verse it bore ran

hang on cling on no matter what
    they say

push on  sing on things will come your
     way

sitting down and whining never helps a bit
best way to get theres by keeping up your
grit

  things are coming she whispered
joyously as she read the familiar lines
thank fortune ive never sat down
to whine hang on cling on push
on  sing on 

  she stopped suddenly and listened
to the sound of feet dragging rather
heavily up the stairs a door slammed
and a chair grated faintly on a bare
floor her mouth drooped

  hes had bad luck again she said
hes come in dog-tired hopeless and
heartless i wonder if-

  she hesitated then opened her door
looked out and listened silence she
crossed the hall and tapped at the op-
posite door

  no answer she tapped again

  its i mr romans-sue charters
can i come in-and hear what-

  a faint sound which she took for a
come in came to her ears she
opened the door entered and stood
aghast

  it was a badly furnished place a
litter of papers lay on the center table
and a man sat there with his head on
his arms motionless

 mr romans-

  he started violently lifting a hand-
some young face to look at her a
thick shock of curly hair surmounted
it and his hands-long nervous trem-
bling hands which lay before him on
the table-were sensitive and delicate

  you he said dully

  they looked at one another she sat
down on the other side of the table
her heart heavy all the recent happi-
ness fled from her face

  i came to ask-what luck- she

faltered

 luck luck luck he struck
his hand on the table and looked at her
despairingly ive had no luck and
never have had and never shall have
everything i sent out came back this
morning and when i called to-day to
see if i could get an answer about those
sonnets an office boy brought them out
to me with the eternal editors re-
grets  i had some hope for those son-
nets if they had taken them it would
have meant such a lot ive just come
back from another editor now with
this

  his fingers worked over the manu-
script on the table crackling the thin
pages

  what is it she almost whispered


top-notch magazine

  the thing i wrote last you liked
it you remember-a country idyll sort
of story lord the irony of making a
country idyll in a garret like this but
it was good sue you know that you
said so yourself

  i know-it was splendid

  they wont have it he said de-
jectedly i cant sell a line havent
for a month and pm about at the end
of my tether an author has to wait
for his pay but his landlady wont
dont said sue gently

  romans looked at her with a mo-
mentary smile flickering over his face

  the good sympathizer he said
stretching out a hand over the table

  she put hers in it a moment looking
away

  he pulled himself together a little
and yourself he asked perfunc-
torily you always ask about my
luck what of yours

  she caught her breath a moment and
hesitated she could not tell him of
her splendid fortune while his own
was still at such low ebb

  much as usual she answered

  he suddenly put his face down on his
arms again

  ill go she said very gently and
ill come back in five minutes with
some tea for you

  she went back to her room and be-
gan the tea-making by means of a tiny
kettle over an oil stove

  while the water heated she stood in
the middle of the floor frowming and
racking her brain for the completion of
a faint elusive idea that all at once
began to flit through it the idea broke
suddenly with a staggering overwhelm-
ing shock and she stood revolving it

  no no no she said fjuickly
half aloud but in a moment it was
why not  he will never know the
idyll is good it would be taken and-
and-and regular contributions would

be arranged for and-

  she walked over to the mantel and
stared at the card above it

  and i would-hang on-cling on
-as usual

 her own manuscript was on the
table with the directors note she

picked up the latter the wording by
ehance presented no difficulties to the
carrying out of her scheme

  i have just met this young author
who i believe shows great promise i
hope youll agree with me that this is

a rattling fine story-

  no title mentioned there

  if you can arrange for regular con-
tributions please do so-

  no name mentioned throughout

  it is quite easy she said simply
the kettle boiled she got out her
cups and saucers and measured tea
into the pot

  it is-very little-to do for him
she murmured faintly

  the slip of paper was folded in her
hand she took up the tray wrent out
and tapped at romans door

  come in he called

  he was still sitting at the table she
moved forward gave him a cup of tea
took the other herself and sat down
opposite him as before

  this is good of you he said with
dreary gratitude

  ive been thinking she said abrupt-
ly that you-you mustnt give way
like this

  mustnt give way he laughed
ironically what a-what an inef-
fectual way of putting it as though
i succumbed to nerves or sick head-
ache mustnt give way i tell you
im right at the end of my tether
broke clean broke cant even pay for
this room-or the food i eat whats
a man to do when hes right up against
a blank wall

  well she said abruptly whats a
blank wall for but for you to put your
back against it and fight

  ive fought he retorted

  i know but ive been thinking
she sipped her tea and forced com-
posure on herself i want you to try
again with the idyll i have a-sort
of-presentiment that it will be ac-
cepted if youll take my advice

  a presentiment

  am i foolish she smiled faintly
but women have instincts you know
i want you to send the story to the
gilt edge monthly
mightier than the sword



  thats the hardest magazine to get

access to-

  so they say but therell be no harm
in trying wheres the story and where
do you keep your envelopes

  the storys on the table and the en-
velopes are over there but-

  but me no buts said sue she
had the story in her hand and she got
up to find the envelopes

  her back was to him as she sliped it
in-with the directors note

  she turned round laughing a little
and sealed down the flap

  mind said she its to go to the
gilt edge monthly 

  he got up looking rather hopeless
no use he said still ill send
it of course to-night you make me
rather ashamed with your glorious op-
timism i wish i had your tempera-
ment

  i have unbounded confidence in this
story she said seriously

  romans sighed i wish i had its
your optimistic temperament again
no she called over her shoulder
as she went across to her own room
its not entirely-my-optimistic tem-
perament

  no it was that magic letter which
inspired her unbounded confidence

  she shut her door sat down bit her
lips and studied the mocking card over
the mantel through a mist

chapter iii

the reward

cue was lingering over a late break-
fast the second day after when she
heard christopher romans feet on the
landing and his hasty knock at her
door

  she pushed away the unappetizing
food opened the door and stood be-
fore him pale and quiet with the shad-
ows of a sleepless night under her gray
eyes

  christophers own eyes glowed and
his whole face was alight with some
new enthusiasm he had undergone a
complete metamorphosis in his hand
he brandished a letter

  i had to come and tell you he
gasped read that look at that
he thrust a letter into her hand oh
its ripping what a presentiment that
was of yours are you also among the
prophets then

  she was leaning against her door
reading the letter it seemed to bum
through the thick mist in her eyes into
her brain it was a splendid over-
whelming fulfillment of her presenti-
ment

  dear sir i have pleasure in accepting
for the gilt edge monthly your story the
idyll which i received this morning we
will pay you the sum of one hundred dollars
for all rights to it and would be glad of a
line from you in acknowledgment

   we should also like to arrange for half a
dozen more stories in the same vein at the
same price and of the same length they
should all be stories of rustic life and if you
are able to undertake the work we should
be glad to receive them one by one as they
are completed with as little delay as pos-
sible i am yours truly

g fenn editor

  romans could hardly wait for her to
read it

  well he asked what do you
think what have you to say isnt
it splendid congratulate me

  i do said sue i do

  she looked up at him with wide gray
eyes

  he rattled on im mighty grateful
to you really-

  nonsense she replied it is noth-
ing

  its turned out trumps hasnt it
though he laughed not looking at
her his shining eyes roving restlessly
scanning the glorious visions ahead
ill tell you what im going to do
when i get my first chek ill pay my
bill here pack my traps and-leave

  leave she was always pale and
her added pallor now was hardly no-
ticeable he did not notice her still-
ness either he was too self-absorbed

  yes ill go into the country or by
the sea and write those other rustic
stories surrounded by the real thing
they must be a success and my book
-ill get on with that now ive got
new heart and hope and zest and ill
finish it theres no tonic like a little


top-notch magazine

good luck is there well i mustnt

  oh itll turn-some day she
wheeled round and walked back into
her room im going to be very busy
-and so are you-so-good morning
so he was going was he right out
of her life

  she closed her door but through it
she could hear him singing she went
up to the card over the mantel and
struck it with a little clenched fist

 oh oh oh-h-h you-you
fraud

chapter iv

travers investigates

hthe first story by christopher ro-

	mans which the gilt edge
monthly published brought the author
a good deal of notice and more com-
missions than he could undertake being
hard at work on others for the same
magazine and on his novel

  he went down to a beautiful little
village on the new england coast and
reveled in rural atmosphere ohile he
laid sure stepping-stones to triumphant
success

  he read and thought and wrote all
for himself his work and his talent
which he fed jealously and assiduously
once or twice he wrote short letters
to sue but by and by he became too
absorbed to write letters

  fortunately he obtained almost im-
mediate publication of his book when
finished and before it had been out a
month it was creating no small stir in
literary circles

  christopher paid one or two flying
visits to town to see his publishers and
retreated again to the country he
forgot to arrange a meeting with sue
before he went up and somehow his
two days in town were crammed so
full that he could not find time to go to

the boarding house on the chance of
finding her in she answered his let-
ters with little cold carefully worded
epistles and he was surprised to find
that she could be uninteresting

  so the winter slipped by and with
the advent of spring geoffrey travers
of the eastern magazine company
ltd returned to new york

  he had an excellent memory and he
lost no time in calling on the editor of
the gilt edge monthly

  how do you like the little con-
tributor i sent you  he asked

  little contributor do you mean
christopher romans hes not a little
contributor oh well hes a very val-
uable addition to our staff-a brilliant
chap theres no doubt his novel is

going very strong they say-

  no no said travers i know
nothing about romans i mean the
little girl i sent to you with a very good
story i met her in a subway train of
all places i was just off to europe
so i scribbled a note on the leaf of my
notebook and  told her to send it in to
you with the story i wanted you to
give her regular work if you could
surely you remember it

  i cant remember what hasnt taken
place said fenn bluntly ive had
no story from a lady recommended by
you i had a penciled note of yours
with romans first story and as the
story was good and you seemed inter-
ested in the man i gave him regular
work with most satisfactory results
theres a big mistake then said
geoffrey travers with a keen memory
of the shabby gray-eyed girl i never
saw romans in my life and dont take
the least interest in him i did not
write you regarding him we must get
to the bottom of this at once

  a letter from fenn the next morn-
ing summoned christopher to town
he found the editor and travers both
in the formers office they dispensed
with preliminaries and explained the
matter at once could he account for
a note purporting to be from the direc-
tor being inclosed with a manuscript of
his when the director flatly denied hav-
ing given him that note
mightier than the sword



  the author was astonished

  i sent in no note with my first story
mr fenn he said and i have no
knowledge of such a note

  yet i received it fenn put in

  christopher was already becoming a
little arrogant with his success and he
stared haughtily

 are you accusing me- he be-
gan

  travers keen eyes wrere on the au-
thors handsome face

  let me explain further to you mr
romans he said abruptly i met a
miss sue charters in a subway train
last fall and after some conversation
about a manuscript she had in her hand
i read it and was struck by its origi-
nality and charm i gave her a note
and asked her to take it with the story
to mr fenn here since then i have
been abroad and did not think it neces-
sary to inquire further into the matter
at the time but on my return i am
confronted with the fact that not miss
sue charters but you benefited by my
letter of introduction are you a friend
of miss charters what are we to
think and how did that note find its
way into the envelope containing your
story 

  romans had flushed and paled and
flushed again

  good heavens he stammered i
-i dont know-i-i-cant explain
how-

  but light had broken

  i can he cried i can i-i see
it all i-we were friends-id had
bad luck-she was sorry for me-she
put the idyll into an envelope her-
self and made me bring it here she
must have-

  have thrown her chance in your
way and put her bread into your
mouth said travers strongly

  yes said christopher slowly
yes

  he stood a moment irresolute while
they looked at him and from him to
each other he turned to the door

 where are you going mr ro-
mans asked the editor

  to see her answered christopher
simply and went out

ioa

  shes in love with him said
travers abruptly i wonder if hes
worth it

  the editor smiled

  yes said he a man that can
write like romans is sound at bottom
he may be selfish and he may take on
him the airs of popularity but the
beautiful themes he touches can only
emanate from a good mind this is
rather a pretty story eh i wonder if
we could get one of em to work it up

afterward-

  dont blaspheme said travers
going out

  christopher had hailed a taxi and
was driving uptown he was furious
with himself her sympathy her si-
lence her strength her resource her
sacrifice-all the dear memories of her
came crowding

  good heavens he said gritting his
teeth what a brute-what a beast ive
been the cold-blooded cruelty of it
and when he came to the boarding
house he heard that she was in he
mounted the stairs to the fourth floor
stood outside the familiar door and
knocked

  come in said a voice faintly

  he went in and saw her sitting at
the table writing with her back to the
door he stole up behind her put two
hands down on hers and held the pen
still she looked up and sat rigid

  sue i- he faltered sue i

have-

  oh you she said hoarsely

  but she had known it with the first
touch of his hands

  i have only just found out what you
have done for me i came at once

to tell-

  she got up slowly and turned round
so that he saw her proud pale face with
the gray eyes burning in it

  to thank me mr romans but i
really dont-require-thanks it was
-was nothing that letter was of no

value to me-

  you threw your chance in my way
you put your bread into my mouth
he was quoting travers huskily why
did you do it sue


top-notch magazine

  she was silent romans caught her
slim shoulders

  i hope you did it because you loved
me he said as i love you sue my
derest i dont know how ive lived
without you these months dont pun-

ish me for my ingratitude now his
arms went round her you did it be-
cause you loved me am i right 

  her lips quivered and she looked
away but nodded a joyous affirma-

  two home runs

           by robert carlton brown
           

showing the power of baseball to change international customs

aseball my dear northrup
is the great leveler thats
why its our national sport
why ive seen a millionaire
author slap a poor publisher
on the back swing him around and
dance the boston with him on the grand
stand all on account of a home run
its the game of a republic a glorious
game for the land of the free and the

home run of the-

  tillinghast paused in his speech as
lord northrup interrupted with a very
french shrug of his shoulders and said
in a very bored english manner

  rather good too theatric but it
interests me you know my dear fel-
low one mustnt forget cricket in ones
savage interest over a new sport
cricket exclaimed tillinghast
dropping- the smooth ivory whist coun-
ter he had been toying with in the card-
room of the van rensselaer club and
leaning over the light table to punctuate
his remarks with energetic thrusts of
his forefinger yes cricket its a
nice homy little game well adapted to
your slow blue british blood good
fireside game like chess cricket on
the hearth quite the place for it
but baseball is so tedious objected
his companion opening his mouth like
a fish and showing his resentment of
tillinghasts tirade by becoming the
more reserved and languid in manner
and speech as tillinghast grew freer
and more enthusiastic now cricket
is rather more exciting you know
makes ones blood stir

  say exclaimed tillinghast again
leaning over the table and fixing very
serious big eyes on the slippery little
ones of the aristocratic englishman
that may be all right but cricket is
a joke compared to baseball give me
three men on bases and two out with
somebody to drive out a three-bagger
thats fun or the opposing team with
a man on third in the ninth inning of a
tied game somebody knocks a zigzag
fly the grand stand gets up on its back
legs and holds its breath the balls
course is as erratic as a meteors it
skips through space and the right-
fielder leaps for it like a trout to a fly
he nabs it thats sport why id
rather go to a ball game than a bull-
fight

  oh so would i infinitely rather
scoffed the other that is if i were
the bull

  tillinghast smiled and slid back into
his chair you know northrup he
remarked thats one subject im car-
ried away on such stress of argument
it really isnt worth while trying to
convince a cricket-loving englishman
that there is anything in baseball but
now lets play fair i went to cricket
matches with you in england you come
with me to a real baseball game

  ive an engagement to drive with my
sister at four answered lord north-
rup glancing at his watch you know
we are here for such a short time but
i really would like to give your baseball
a fair hearing so i can tell them about
it at home i suppose it will be quite
two home runs



droll-all rough-and-tumble and sub-
way crush like everything in your dear
outlandish america by the way could
a gentleman play your game-the aw-
ful costume and all you know

  a gentlemancould play the game if
he had enough brawn-and brain re-
plied tillinghast but come phone
your sister to go with us shell enjoy
it im sure its almost time

ii

ten minutes before the game was
 called sardonis tillinghast ushered
the honorable evelyn and lord north-
rup into a box at the hilltop field
they were right beside the little inclosed
bench at the edge of the grass occupied
by the yankee players tillinghast
pointed out to his guests the famous
players on the new york team and ex-
plained the principles of the game

  tillinghast says this is the great
american leveler my dear remarked
lord northrup turning to his sister i
do hope you wont elope with the
catchee or whatever they call that muz-
zled chap behind the bat	

  theyre a clean-looking lot the girl
remarked leaning forward in the box
and watching the practice with evident
interest she asked tillinghast several
rapid-fire questions

  the game was called and cleveland
took the field chase to the bat for the
yankees chase eased out a two-bg-
ger and the crowd broke loose applaud-
ing wildly even lord northrup sat
up and his bored manner began to slip
through his fingers as he placed his
palms on his knees and assumed the
neck-free position of a typical fan
as the game progressed the honor-
able evelyn became enthusiastic she
quickly gathered the drift of things and
an excited flush came into her cheeks
making them vivid her eyes sparkled
with the fun of it and she leaned for-
wafd breathlessly

  in the second inning a yankee player
came to bat and a slight murmur ran
through the audience

  whos that asked the girl taking

in the well-knit capable figure poising
with the bat his keen eyes glinting at
the opposing pitcher

  thats fordham catching for the
yankees he was discovered only a
month ago hes been doing wonder-
ful work but they say hes a bit er-
ratic replied tillinghast

  looks the part i should say put in
lord northrup

  yes but he has such an air about
him answered the sister now one
would pick him out of a thousand as a
gentleman he has the earmarks he
wears the ball suit s easily as though
it were evening dress did you hear
him talking to that other player before
he went to the bat rather neat eng-
lish he used-for an american i won-
der what he is in private life

  probably the father of nine baseball-
playing children with an anxious wife
who stays at home and does the weekly
wash while he flits about the country
like the gay young lothario he looks
was lord northrups prompt reply

  hardly that put in tillinghast
you know baseball is as profitable as
politics some of those boys get as high
as ten thousand dollars for a seasons
work

  rea-ally i exclaimed lord north-
rup what a country this is to be
sure one might better forget the dip-
lomatic service the army and the law
and train his young hopeful to baseball

  look exclaimed the honorable
evelyn grasping the rail and leaning
forward tensely as fordham bunted the
ball chopping it off so that it sizzled
through the grass halfway to the
pitcher

  the third baseman and pitcher both
sprang for it but before one of them
got it and snapped it to first fordham
had slid and was safe

  fine i cried the honorable evelyn
jumping to her feet with the rest of the
throng and watching fordham intently
as he rose jerked his face into a grim
smile and dusted his clothes carefully
stooping to inspect a rip in his trousers
near the knee

  get a valet cried a cleveland fan

  youre all right fordham new


top-notch magazine

york drowned out the josher that
was a beaut

  evelyn drawled lord northrup
when his sister dropped back limply into
her seat her lips parted and eyes in a
glow youre becoming quite barbar-
ous he turned abruptly and finished
tillinghast i was just wondering
where he could place that-uh-that
round leather ball you know without
this other set of chaps with the funny
hose catching that man on the second
-ah-bucket you call it rather neat-
ly figured out i must admit ap-
proaches cricket on that point

  and passes it on all others smiled
tillinghast his eyes happy with the suc-
cess of his team

iii

the lords younger sister was on her
feet half the time during the cru-
cial fifth inning when new york tied
cleveland lord northrup seemed un-
easy at her youthful demonstration but
he rather liked the spirit of the thing
too and when the honorable evelyn
gave a little shriek of disappointment
as a cleveland fielder caught a difficult
fly lord northrup turned to tilling-
hast and remarked

  the game is a leveler to be sure
i do hope the gentleman protecting his
face and stomach behind the catchee will
give correct decisions and play fair or
evelyn will jump the bars and help mob
him but really the players are quite
decent its onfy the audience thats so
vulgar loud and disagreeable

  oh i say dont please stop carp-
ing said his sister you know im
rather worse than most of the rest at

this shouting ga-

  at that moment a bat whizzed over
the railing and fell at her feet causing
no little consternation as lord north-
rup and tillinghast bobbed for it to-
gether and crashed into each others
hats

  fordham who had been swinging two
bats near the bench preparatory to
choosing one and following the batter
on the plate was responsible for the ac-
cident one of the bats had slipped

  from his grasp and shot over the railing
of the near-by box

  he rushed up at that moment and
exclaimed in a soft anxious tone with
an english intonation

  oh i say im awfully sorry youre

not hurt im so sorry i didnt-

he looked anxiously into the honorable
evelyns flushed face and then past
it to tillinghasts when he stopped
abruptly

  forcing a calm expression he looked
at tillinghast with a mild curious in-
terest

  tillinghasts face shifted in quick
changes his eyebrows shot up in rec-
ognition then his hand tightened on the
back of lord northrups chair the cor-
ners of his lips drew down and he
looked blankly at fordham

  the honorable evelyn caught the by-
play as she was helping to hand the bat
back to fordham

  its quite all right she smiled to the
player looking deep into his blue eyes
and wondering mightily i want to
tell you how we have all enjoyed your
playing

  the field was waiting for fordham
he stood easily unconcerned in the
gaze of the anxious audience who had
missed the little scene and was impa-
tient of the slightest delay

  its good of you to say so i do
hope the bat didnt strike you it was
carelessness on my part my bat han-
dling must seem very amateurish

  quite an unusual procedure for a
professional ball player to linger in con-
versation at a box with the whole coun-
try waiting for him to go to the bat
and possibly decide the tie

  its quite all right she repeated
with finality

  fordham lifted his cap smiled softly
cast a quick look toward tillinghast
then swept the box with an inclusive
glance not missing lord northrup loll-
ing in the corner and turned resolutely
toward the field

  it was all extremely interesting to the
audience and some of the yankees
stared from their bench and exchanged
snatches of talk concerning their fellow
two home runs



  player the looks on their faces clearly
showing there was some mystery about
him

  wasnt he jolly so finished so
nice exclaimed the girl

  oh evelyn do be rational replied
her brother i dare say hes only a
common enough sort of chap after all
but his very intonation showed that he
too was startled by the easy manner of
fordham

  tillinghast said nothing until the girl
turned abruptly and remarked

  he seemed to recognize you do tell
me whats the-the answer thats
what you say here isnt it

  oh ive an ordinary enough face
answered tillinghast probably he
took me for some one else-or maybe he
was taken aback by the thought that i
was your husband

  dont be dragging love and that sort
of thing into this drawled lord north-
rup evelyn is so young and roman-
tic shell be eloping i tell you america
has a horrible influence on your young
girls imagine politeness in a footman
causing surprise why my dear serv-
ants must be more polite than their
masters or there would be no need for
them i dare say hes had training in
one of your good old southern fam-
ilies

  dont talk like that pouted the girl
he had such an air you jolly well
know hes no commoner oh see
crack fordham had swung on the
ball and it was swooping in a long
graceful curve toward the boundary
fence

  the audience was on its feet in an
instant screaming-

  go to it

  make it a homer

  oh skyrocket

  eat up the mileage

  make it home

 home

  clevelands right fielder the sun in
his eyes failed to judge the ball it
went over his head bounced and rolled
almost to the fence the shortstop and
left fielder filled in forming a relay to
forward the ball but before it had
reached second fordham had touched

  third in a swinging circle and was leap-
ing home

  yells split the air lord northrup
clapped hands to his sensitive ears but
the honorable evelyn screamed with the
rest

  the ball came suddenly flashing
home fordham and the ball were neck
and neck he made a hulking lurch for
the plate threw his body at the catchers
feet and slid safe on his ankle

  the spectators went wild tilling-
hast was standing on the seat of his
chair shouting madly and the honora-
ble evelyn had jerked her more retir-
ing brother to his feet and was hanging
to his arm- shouting in his supersensi-
tive ear even lord northrup broke
down contracted the germ and let out a
little squawk of approval

  but fordham didnt get up the au-
dience hardly noticed it in their enthu-
siasm until the umpire and the catcher
got hold of fordham and lifted him
carefully the second he touched his
right foot to the ground the muscles of
his face tied themselves into an excru-
ciating knot it wouldnt support his
weight

iv

hthe audience jabbered wildly and the
honorable evelyn let out a sur-
prised startled gasp

  tillinghast stood nervously watching
as they carried the injured player to-
ward the long low shed occupied by the
yankees tillinghast put a hand on the
box rail and seemed on the verge of
vaulting over

  fordham glanced up at the box and
smiled bravely to the girl as she leaned
forward gazing at him with a moving
sympathy

  again tillinghast started as though to
vault the rail when fordham looked at
him strangely and tillinghast with an
abrupt explanation sank back into his
chair

  fordham sprained his ankle an-
nounced the umpire to the anxious audi-
ence there was a low murmur of pity
and the game proceeded

  but the little box party was disgusted

  its brutal horrible exclaimed


top-notch magazine

the honorable evelyn shuddering
slightly and he was such a fine frank
chap why couldnt some one else have
been hurt 

  i told you what to expect her
brother replied

  tillinghast said nothing his per-
turbation was evident they left be-
fore the end of the game and parted
when they reached fifth avenue just
before tillinghast dropped them at their
hotel the girl who had been very quiet
during the ride asked anxiously

  dont you know something of this
man that was injured sardonis i
wish somebody could do something for
him he was so unusual

  poor chap was all tillinghast re-
plied

 but im sure he knew you he
looked at you again when he passed and
there seemed to be a challenge in his
eyes do tell me-im so interested
tillinghast pressed his lips together
thoughtfully for an instant then smiled
to her frankly

  we may know each other if any-
thing interesting occurs ill let you
know

  oh do she exclaimed

  yes mocked lord northrup do
give evelyn a chance to make a fuss
over your hero he was such a gentle-
man probably a reformed floorwalker
such a delicate air one might think
he had once worked in a delicatessen
shop oh these young women tilling-
hast 

  that night tillinghast mada several
casual inquiries by phone and messen-
ger but evidently he found nothing sat-
isfying

  the next morning as he was glanc-
ing through the personal advertise-
ments at breakfast as was his wont he
came upon the following and mused
long over it

  sarto sprained ankle off for season
cant meet payment try loan from h e
nothing serious dont worry will try
something else	p e r

  its a frightful shame exclaimed
tillinghast throwing down the paper
imagine prescott having to resort to
the personals but then he couldnt

have cabled direct for fear of giving
up his name and the resultant publicity
the paper was doubtless instructed to
cable the ad

  jumping up abruptly he ordered his
motor and went at once to the flower
hospital where he found the injured
baseball player lying in a public ward

  with much difficulty he managed to
have him removed to a private room for
fordham wished no favors from any
one that afternoon the honorable
evelyn properly chaperoned by her
brother and tillinghast called on the
injured man and extended her sympathy
and appreciation of his brilliant work
it was an unusual thing to do but til-
linghast had arranged it at the prompt-
ing of both the girl and fordham

-lord northrup seemed charmed with
the baseball player but he objected
strenuously during the following week
when his sister insisted on going daily
to the hospital and reading to the poor
fellow

  the friendship grew and became in-
timate by the time fordham was al-
lowed to leave the hospital tillinghast
insisted that he be his guest and he
arranged many jolly parties which left
lord northrup in a wondering mood
and made him threaten to take the hon-
orable evelyn home at once but their
departure was postponed from time to
time until finally there came a disturb-
ing element

  fordham got well and wanted to join
his team tillinghast and the honor-
able evelyn objected but he was reso-
lute fordham seemed to grow more
uneasy daily he had several long let-
ters from london and after each in-
sisted that he must join his team which
was then on the road tillinghast made
a thousand excuses to keep him from
it which was all very strange to lord
northrup

  tillinghast made no effort to account
for his interest in the baseball player in
answer to the importunate questions of
the english couple he insisted that he
knew nothing more than they of the
man that he had taken him at his face
value as a gentleman and congenial com-
panion
two home runs



  fordham grew so uneasy that he be-
gan to avoid the honorable evelyn and
things seemed coming to a climax lord
northrup daily threatening to go home
and the honorable evelyn insisting that
tillinghast explain the mystery sur-
rounding fordham

v

ne evening tillinghast arrived
home alone after dinner having
left fordham to complete an errand
asking for his mail he received several
letters and a telegram he glanced at
the wire and found it addressed to his
friend

  his eyebrows raised slightly the en-
velope trembled in his fingers for a mo-
ment and then he loosened the poorly
pasted flap took out the message and
read it deliberately

  he had no more than finished and
hastily resealed the envelope wthen
fordham entered and tillinghast
handed him the message

  fordhams color quickened as he
glanced at the envelope and excusing
himself went to his room to read it

  tillinghast stepped to the telephone
called a number softly and having se-
cured it whispered several abrupt sen-
tences hanging up directly and calling
his man he gave the man definite
instructions concerning something in a
low tone and then settled himself to
reading fordham entered shortly he
seemed perturbed and anxious

  dropping into a chair beside tilling-
hast he sat silent for some minutes oc-
casionally opening his mouth as though
he would say something and then clos-
ing it sharply finally he reached out
and touched his companions arm

  till he said youve been more
than a friend to me im going to get
even with you for all tliis some day

  oh youre at that again please re-
member that gratitude is shown in ac-
tions not in words replied tillinghast
i suppose you are merely prefacing an-
other appeal for freedom

  till-there was a catch in the
others voice-i know youre right and
i hate to go back but ive got to do

something you dont understand it
isnt only that sarto and i need the
money

  no there was a smile in the re-
ply

  no theres something else ive-

ive- he struggled for expression

well im not man enough to fight it
out thats all

  why dont you marry the girl
smiled tillinghast not looking up from
his book

  confound you cried fordham
jumping up youre the coldest-
blooded man i ever knew till im go-
ing back i tell you im going back to
the game therere some things a man
cant stand being jollied about

  well its on your own shoulders
but you wont go back you know you
wont your better judgment has got to
assert itself-if you have any

  fordham paused a moment stepped
over and shook hands then said good
night curtly and went to his room

vi

at half past eleven tillinghast slipped
to the front door and opened it
quietly in response to a slight tap ad-
mitting lord northrup and the honor-
able evelyn who seemed charged with
electrical wonder

  stepping to the library he put out the
lights turned on the low burner in the
hall and pressed his friends into a con-
cealed window seat in a nook by the
stairs which led to the second story

  there was breathless silence for five
minutes then from above came the
noise of a door being softly opened
something heavy scraped along the
floor for a moment and then the stairs
creaked with the weight of a man de-
scending

  they saw him through the shadows
it was fordham struggling down with
a heavy grip in each hand and two
precious baseball bats in a case clutched
under one arm he had a burglarious
aspect and a quick nervous way of
looking about

  as he left the last step and started
across the hall for the door tillinghast


top-notch magazine

jogged the honorable evelyns elbow in
signal and a second later she had
swished across the intervening space
and was standing between fordham and
the door

  at that moment tillinghast turned up
the light and a clatter followed as ford-
ham dropped his bats and bags

  caught red-handed cried tilling-
hast

  lord northrup gasped

  fordhams gaze was leveled steadily
on the dazzling english girl before him
standing with a pathetic whimsical lit-
tle smile on her eager face

  you-you were going away she
said breaking the silence

 no-no yes- he faltered

stepping toward her

  no smiled tillinghast he was just
sneaking out for a little baseball prac-
tice by moonlight

  fordham turned and stared at til-
linghast passing his hand nervously
over his flushed face

  whats all this about he asked

 we wanted to say good-by we
didnt want you to slip off alone in the
night like this ive had my man watch-
ing to see that you didnt slip out re-
plied tillinghast

 but how-howd you know i was
going

  i intercepted your telegram like the
villain in the play and when i found it
read as i suspected leave new york
grand central twelve-thirty-eight to-
night join team in detroit i simply
couldnt resist this little party to see
you off

  oh cried the girl youre not
going back to baseball

  fordham wavered

  hes not going back if- tilling-
hast prompted

  oh i cant till you havent played
fair  fordham turned and drew closer
to the girl i could have made my get-
away but i cant stand farewells

  you-you werent going without
saying good-by to met the girl asked

  fordham stepped closer and said
something in a very low tone

  this is no place for us northrup
said tillinghast taking the englishman
by the arm and pushing him into an-
other room in spite of his reluctance
assuring him its all right its all
right ill explain fordhams real
name is prescott the edgeworth pres-
cotts you know quite as good a family
as any in the land father died in the
midst of financial reverses left debts
prescott came home from two years in
china unknown here a good deal
changed shaved off his mustache
went into baseball to make his living-
only work he knew you see used to be
a star on his college team and had kept
in practice by organizing a team of his
own in shanghai-and support his
mother calls mother sarto theyre
rare pals he was bucking a tough
game trying to pay off fathers debts
and not making enough out of baseball
to support himself and mother de-
cently

  the deuce you say remarked lord
northrup

  several days later at the club til-
linghast met young tyson and fell into
conversation

  i hear old prescott who used to be-
long here is to be married in london
to the honorable evelyn northrup next
month looks like fortune hunting in
the wrong preserve doesnt it  re-
marked young tyson

  hadnt heard was prescott here in
new york

  so it seems but just privately sort
of incog like a traveling prince or some-
thing you know nobody seems to
have seen him here sailed back quietly
with lord northrup and his sister
they say hes marrying her to recoup
the family fortunes she has such a lot
you know rather odd for a ruined
young american to marry an english
woman with a title and a fortune isnt
it

  very said sardonis tillinghast

college spirit

onald thorne standing
before the open window of
his room in dascomb cottage
spending the beautiful early
spring afternoon in study
gave vent to an exclamation of anger
as a chorus of exuberant voices from
a room in baldwin cottage came to
him

 he knew that a crowd of sopho-
mores his classmates gathered in bud-
worth stanhopes room were having a
jolly time and he bitterly resented the
fact that they could be happy and care-
free while he must grind to keep up
with his class

  let them tutor and sell books to pay
their way through college he told him-
self vindictively then they wont talk
so much about college spirit or loaf
around the campus singing foolish
songs its all foolishness this mad
wasting of time and talent on the ath-
letic field because the coach says our
alma mater needs our help

  thorne was neither a favorite nor
unpopular with the student body at
oberlin they knew that he pressed
clothes tutored deficient freshmen and

roamed the adjacent country trying to
sell books in his efforts to give him-
self a college training he had never
come out for an athleticteam or given
any physical prowess to his college and
consequently he was a nonentity

  once in a debate at the phi kappa
literary society he had gone on record
as stating that students should indulge
in athletic sports only for the aid they
gave in keeping a sound mind in a
sound body and that competition
should be abolished

  at last thorne closed his book fur-
ther study being out of the question for
him so long as the singing continued in
baldwin cottage feeling dull from
his afternoon of application to books
he decided to don his track suit and go
out to the athletic park track for a
brisk half-mile run

  on arriving at the quarter-mile track
he found coach kemp and ralph pal-
metter the track captain in earnest
conversation

  we have got to unearth a fairly fast
half-miler before we run the two-mile
relay with miami next month insisted
the coach with rothrock miles and
you running in fast time a fourth man
will give us a crack relay team i want
to find a promising candidate before


top-notch

magazine

our open meet here saturday so i can
give him a try-out in it

  that is the meet in which i want to
win the individual point cup said pal-
metter here i am a senior and i
have never won it i have a show for
the open half mile and the shot put if
some other fellow doesnt show up bet-
ter in those events between now and
saturday but as you say we need a
half-miler for the miami race

  hello heres new material ex-
claimed the coach as thorne jogged
out on the track come right here
thorne have you ever run the half
mile

  i have admitted donald coldly

but-

  get on your marks ordered the
coach joyously and the personality that
had made oberlins football squad
ready to die for kemp impelled the
sophomore to obey against his will

  reluctantly he prepared for the start
and coach kemp held the pistol in one
hand and the stop watch in the other
bang

  almost instinctively thorne shot
away with a beautiful start and fell at
once into a long ground-covering
stride that brought a gleam of delight
to the coachs eyes and a look of appre-
hension to the face of the track captain
he was afraid that a fast half-miler
brought to light before the open meet
would endanger his chances in that
event and the chances of winning the
cup offered to the oberlin athlete mak-
ing the most points in the meet

 faster and faster thorne sped
around the quarter-mile track running
in a natural almost perfect form and
apparently in the best of training the
coach held the stop watch in readiness
and the track squad realizing that per-
haps old oberlin had found the much-
sought fourth man for the two-mile
relay team which was to meet miami
cheered donald on and urged him to
finish with a sprint keeping his stride
strong to the last the sophomore
fought his way grimly to the tape and
reeled across it as the coach snapped
the stop watch on the runner

  captain palmetter looked at coach
kemp inquiringly and for an answer
the latter held up the watch as it had
caught thorne

  two minutes flat gasped palmet-
ter concealing his dismay with an ef-
fort for his fastest time in that dis-
tance was two seconds slower there
could be no doubt as to the record for
the indicator had been checked flatly on
the sixty-second mark

  i think the relay problem is settled
said the coach happily we have a
matter of three weeks before the race
with miami and thorne can be trained
to run an even faster half mile thorne
i want you to join the training table to-
night and appear on the field for prac-
tice every day at half past three sharp
a crowd of track men and students
had gathered around after donald had
run his sensational trial and from
these to the coach the sophomore looked
with a pale face

  there were several reasons why he
did not intend to obey the coachs or-
ders  reasons that for the most part he
must keep to himself the college
would think that he was afraid to run
perhaps but that must be as it would
he did not believe in competitive ath-
letics and thought it a waste of time
to train on the track each day

  i am sorry he said with grim de-
termination but i cannot spare the
time from my studies to indulge in
track work sir i have never been in
sympathy with the athletic madness in
our colleges and because others waste
their time is no cause for me doing it
beside i have my tutoring hours and
my time for canvassing

  he could not have struck greater con-
sternation to the crowd had he smote
the coach squarely in the face

  even palmetter though he felt a
thrill of relief that this phenomenal
half-miler had refused to run and
would not be his rival in the open meet
was surprised at thornes action and
he virtuously rebuked the sophomore
for his lack of college spirit

  oberlin needs you sorely thorne
he declared unless you make the
for the glory of oberlin



fourth man on the two-mile relay we
must run a poor half-miler and miami
will defeat us you must have some
other reason for your refusal to run for
your college almost every track man
stands high in his classes we need all
the points we can get to win the open
meet here saturday

  why thorne exclaimed coach
kemp you are a novice and we can
rely on you to win us five points in the
novice half as well as place in the open
eight-eighty surely you cant go back
on your alma mater at the hour when
she needs you most have you no col-
lege spirit

  thorne faced them angrily here
was a chance to express his views on
athletics and this so-called college spirit

  college spirit he repeated bitterly
i have heard that strain harped on
again and again students must cast
aside their studies and fall behind their
classes because the college needs them
on the athletic field they must forget
their obligations to their sacrificing
parents and play football because
miami or some other college has a
strong eleven if i slight my studies
and fail in my exams to run for ober-
lin i suppose ill have college spirit

  i am working my way through col-
lege he continued and by the time
i have tutored and tried to make some
money selling books i have barely
enough time for my studies if i came
out for the track team my afternoons
would be thrown away and my studies
would suffer frankly i never be-
lieved in this craze for athletic victory
at any cost and i shall not suffer by it

  he could not have made himself
more unpopular by any other speech
for a student of oberlin to refuse to
run for his college at a time when his
services were sorely needed to throw
down the track team just when his bril-
liant prowess had been discovered and
himself hailed as a rescuer was the
height of treason

  he had deemed his life bitter enough
already forced as he was to forego
many pleasures because of having to
work in his spare time but the past was

as nothing compared to the odium and
condemnation he was now to endure

  very well the coach said coldly
i shall not ask you again thorne
the man who will not give his best abil-
ity to his college on the athletic field
when it is needed most is a cad and a
coward and he will never bring glory
to his college in any way you could
have helped us to win the open meet
saturday you could have enabled us to
defeat miami for we need you on the
relay but you have made your de-
cision

  in silence donald thorne turned
from them and left the field a hiss
or two sounded from some in the
crowd but the coach wheeled angrily
and the derisive noise ceased at once
after the sophomore had gone coach
kemp faced the track captain more in
sorrow than in anger

  well palmetter he said it is up
to you to win all the points you can in
the open meet saturday for we shall
need them to win from ohio wes-
leyan

  a few minutes later palmetter left
the field and made his way to his room
in baldwin cottage where his room-
mate was entertaining the same merry
crowd of sophomores that had dis-
turbed thornes study as the track
captain entered the room the joyous
students burst into a song of welcome
in honor of one of oberlins athletic
stars

  for hes a jolly good fellow which
nobody can deny

  across in dascomb cottage donald
thorne heard the words and knew for
whom they were sung and yet he was
sincere in his conviction as to athletics
and though he was mistaken in think-
ing that college spirit was a demoraliz-
ing influence he had more of it even
at that moment than did the track
captain

  as for ralph palmetter knowing as
he did that oberlin sorely needed
thornes points in the open meet and
his running on the relay he was glad
at heart that donald had refused to
run for now he was sure of winning
the point cup

an odd try-out

nri-ie next afternoon donald thorne

	started out in the country near
oberlin with a copy of the book he was
trying to sell on commission

  his heart was bitter within him as
he left the town limits and walked out
in the open country since his decision
on the athletic field he had been ostra-
cized in college the news of his refusal
to run for oberlin had spread rapidly
and where previously he had been un-
noticed now he was pointed out and
avoided

  all this only served to make him the
more miserable especially as he had
begun to question his own convictions

  he had canvassed the farms for three
miles out unsucessfully when he came
to a beautiful country home on the
road

  the house was at the end of a lane
half a mile in length and the sopho-
more had hopes of making his first sale
of the day as he walked slowly toward
it he knew the natural antipathy of
housewives toward agents of any kind
and his heart was too bitter for him to
assume a light manner

  near the house he came upon a boy
lying at full length on the grass deep
in some interesting magazine story as
he approached his footfalls aroused
the young fellow and he looked up at
thorne seeing the book under don-
alds arm he immediately guessed his
mission and scowled

  no life of roosevelt or dash for
the pole to-day he growled there
ought to be a law passed against such
public nuisances as you fellows this
past week we have had no less than
nineteen college students trying to sell
us everything from a clock to a mouse
trap

  but just look at the volume
pleaded thorne dispiritedly perhaps
your mother would-

  he never finished for at that mo-
ment there came a most unearthly howl
a cross between the war cry of a sioux
indian and the wail of a lost soul and
around the corner of the housecame

the most weirdly dressed human being
that thorne had ever seen he was a
tall finely built young man but there
was a wild gleam in his eyes and don-
ald backed away apprehensively

  its my brother cried the boy
hes a yale man and he hurt himself
by overstudy they sent him home to
rest his mind he doesnt often get
this dangerous though

  even in his alarm donald thorne
could not help gazing in wonder at the
fearful and wonderful costume of the
young man whose mind was apparently
unbalanced from overstudy he wore
a light-blue running jersey marked
with a big y a pair of football pants
heavily padded basket-ball stockings a
cross-country shoe on one foot and on
the other baseball footgear while to
cap the climax literally he bore a golf
toque on his head and its tassel
streamed out wildly in the breeze

  in his hand he carried a murderous-
looking army revolver and with wild
yells he bore down on the helpless
thorne

  whoop howled the yale man ex-
uberantly i am captain of the olym-
pic games team and i am looking for
a fast half-miler to take to sweden
this summer got to have a man who
can do it in less than twenty-two sec-
onds hello heres material

  now bill began his brother
soothingly but the yale man was be-
yond the power of argument and per-
suasion he was possessed of the one
idea that a fast half-miler must be
found and thorne was the only victim
eligible for his insane determination

  i ran for yale in sixteen hundred
and seven he announced dramatically
there were twenty-three hundred of
us in the race and i beat the field in
the half mile by twenty-six miles they
gave me a cheese sandwich and begged
me not to run again say you long-
legged nuisance i want to give you a
try-out for the half we will run down
to the gate it is just a half mile from
here	x

  but argued thorne i am not
dressed for running now just wait till
i go back to college anti get my track
for the glory of oberlin



suit will you then ill run you a
half mile

  oho laughed the young giant cun-
ningly they never come back no
you can take your shoes off and run
now say what do you think of my
running suit isnt it a fine one well
lets go ill hold the pistol and start us
with it

  he was twirling the big revolver in
a dangerous way and in some anxiety
thorne laid down his book and pre-
pared to run he was determined to
keep on running when the gate was
reached and not stop till he got to
college

  he was sure he could leave the weak-
minded yale man far in the rear the
man was much the larger athlete and a
glance at him showed donald that re-
sistance was useless while the younger
brother could give no assistance

  on second thought said the yale
man ill carry this gun along and
then if you start to loaf on me ill
have to shoot you up some a fast
half-miler must be got for the eyes of
the civilized world are upon us and our
nation needs us now

  from the yale mans conversation
thorne got the impression that over-
indulgence in athletics and not in study
had turned his brain so he did not dis-
pute a single point with the big student
and the bigger revolver but got down
on his marks when the other ordered it

  the starting commands were given
and when the big gun barked the ober-
lin man shot forward with his rival
lumbering at his heels

  remembering his fast running of the
day before thorne let out in a few
seconds and had the satisfaction of
hearing the thundering of the yale
mans strangely assorted shoes grow
fainter he would not have felt so se-
cure had he known that the big athlete
was trotting along with the greatest of
ease studying his form carefully and
taking an occasional aim at his heels
with the revolver as the gate was
neared donald put his strength into a
final sprint

  going some whooped his pursuer
closing the gap between them with ease

that was ridiculous here we go
beaten at the tape

  he let go a volley of shots and don-
ald thought his last hour had come

  then in the last ten yards the yale
runner shot past the bewildered ober-
lin man and finished an easy winner

  the sophomore who had run a fast
race was too surprised at its result to
be alarmed now so he staggered to the
bank by the roadside and sat down

  his captor sat down beside him and
began to massage his muscles beneath
the basket-ball stockings as he glanced
down at his outlandish garb he was un-
able to restrain his mirth any longer
and he rolled on the grass laughing
convulsively

  oho he howled if my chums at
yale could see me now  what would
the track squad say if they saw bill
parmalee chasing a poor book agent
down a dusty road in such a get-up as
this  but say fellow that was a crack
half mile you tore off it couldnt have
been worse than two minutes for i let
out pretty well and my best record is a
minute and fifty-seven seconds

  donald thorne had risen and was
staring at his big companion in wonder

  bill parmalee he cried yales
famous half-miler and oberlins former
champion at that distance why you
are a hero at college if only we had

you there to run-

  he stopped abruptly for he remem-
bered that oberlin needed him and that
he had failed his college

  parmalee gazed at him quizzically

  i didnt know you were an oberlin
man he confessed soberly my
brother and i saw you coming and as
we have been so pestered with agents of
late i decided to have a little fun with
you he gave you the impression that
i wasnt right in the mind which may
be more truth than jest and i donned
this garb seized this young cannon
and trailed you but i had no idea you
would run such a fast half of course
you are going to help oberlin out the
coach told me yesterday that a fourth
man was needed on the two-mile relay
donald was silent he wanted to
confess to this big good-natured ath-

lete just why he could not run for
oberlin but he could not bring himself
to lay open the wound that hurt him
so parmalees unquestionable loyalty
to old oberlin made him doubt his own
beliefs for there was something whole-
some and bracing in the faith of the
yale man

  i cant spare the time from my stud-
ies he faltered at last i-i dont be-
lieve a fellow should slight his class
work to engage in athletics

  parmalee gazed at him in surprise

  i am not going to condemn you
he said at last but i think that when
it comes to an understanding of college
life and ideals you are a novice a
college is a world to itself and the
student who does not take part in all its
phases is missing something a wtell-
balanced existence with a proper pro-
portion of each thing makes the manly
wholesome collegian

  i dont believe that your studies
keep you from running he continued
i have yet to see the honest whole-
hearted athlete who is a flunker the
one that fights to make his college a
winner on the athletic field will stand
high in his class i was in athletics at
oberlin yet i ranked well in my
studies college spirit my friend is
simply the willingness to sacrifice per
sonal interests and ambition for the
good of ones alma mater now i
dont ask you to fall down in your stud-
ies to run for oberlin but there is
surely some personal interest that you
can sacrifice

  donald had experienced a revulsion
of feeling the talk of parmalee had
shown him how utterly out of sympathy
he had been with college life as an en-
tirety he had misjudged his fellow
students and missed much of the all-
round existence the yale man spoke of
he knew that he could easily keep up
in his studies and run and that the sac-
rifice must be made along another line

  i think i see things clearer he said
at last it will mean a mighty big
sacrifice to me parmalee but if the
coach will have me now ill run in the
open meet saturday

  and ill be there to cheer you on

answered the yale star heartily after
you get out of college and into the uni-
versity you will come to know that col-
lege spirit is the finest thing in the
world good-by and good luck

  as soon as he reached oberlin again
donald thorne went straight to coach
kemp and informed him that he was
sorry for his refusal of the day before
and that he was ready to run now if
his college could use him in any race

  with a glad smile which was not re-
flected on captain palmetters face the
coach held out his hand

  thats the true spirit thorne he
said heartily

chapter iii

the sacrifice

fydnald thornes decision to
 run for his college was costing
captain ralph palmetter a lot of worry
the stop watch had shown that the
sophomore covered the half mile in two
minutes flat and palmetter knew that
he could not do it within a second of
that time in the meet that meant that
thorne had a better chance of winning
the open half than he did and if he won
the novice event with ease he would
have more points than his captain even
if palmetter took first in the shot put
so the captain began to question
thornes past performance with a view
to ascertaining his standing as a novice

 from hopewell thornes room-
mate he learned that the sophomore
had run second in a half-mile race at a
meet held by his prep school three years
before

  craftily counting on the sophomores
comparative ignorance of athletic rules
the track captain had a talk with him in
his room one day

  you are still a novice arent you
he asked with every appearanec of in-
terest you have never won a place in
any event have you

  yes answered thorne regretfully
at my prep school i won second place
in the half mile at a meet we held does
that debar me from the novice class 
i am afraid it does sighed pal-
metter sorrowfully of course it is
for the glory of oberlin



best that we should know this in time
for you might win the novice half and
be protested then we should lose the
points ill see the coch about it

  he consulted coach kemp carefully
keeping from him a bit of knowledge
he had gathered from thorne about his
past victory the coach believing pal-
metter to be acting in a sportsmanlike
manner gave his opinion

  i have already entered thorne in
the novice half and the same event in
the amateur class he said and i
counted on his winning the novice and
placing in the other but of course
he cant run now since he isnt a novice
ill just keep him in the open event and
try him out for the relay team

  palmetters conscience troubled him
for by a bit of trickery he had gotten his
rival out of the novice half in which he
had a perfect right to run he had
learned that in the race in which
thorne had run second back in his
prep days there had been no prizes
offered and by the rule of the ama-
teur athletic union concerning the
novice a runner is a novice until he has
tvon a prize for placing in some open
event therefore thorne was per-
fectly eligible as a novice but as the
coach naturally inferred from palmet-
ters talk that he had won a medal he
was to withdraw him from the race

  it was the day before the open meet
at oberlin that palmetter afraid lest
his rival should defeat him in the open
half mile his favorite event laid his
plans to insure victory for himself

  he decided that he would rather have
thorne win the novice half mile in
which he was not entered than for him-
self to beat the fast sophomore in the
amateur race this would bring more
glory to him for beyond a doubt the
speedy novice would have an easy time
winning the novice half but if he could
defeat thorne in the other event it
would be much to his credit

  accordingly he went to coach kemp
that night as though he had accidentally
stumbled on a bit of information that
would make sure of oberlins winning
five points by thorne in the novice half

  thorne has just told me that he did

not receive a medal or prize for placing
in his event he said with apparent
joy there were no prizes given at
all in the meet therefore he is eligible
as a novice isnt he coach

  he is exclaimed coach kemp
who had the colleges best interests at
heart and was planning for her success
i am glad you found this out pal-
metter and came to me with it ill
run thorne in the novice half too
palmetter winced at the undeserved
praise but his mind was made up and
from the coachs room he hastened to
find donald thorne to approach him
with a plan which apparently meant a
big sacrifice on thornes part he
found the sophomore alone in his room
and he lost no time in getting to the root
of the matter

  thorne he began carefully 
dont know wrhether you have any col-
lege spirit or not you didnt have it
once and this coming out to run may
be a bluff to win back the respect of
your college mates which you forfeit-
ed however i am going on the as-
sumption that you are awakened and
that you are ready to sacrifice your own
ambition for the good of old oberlin
he had come to thorne at a moment
most propitious for his own plan for
donald had been awakened by parma-
lees talk on college spirit and he was
now heartily ashamed of the way he
had refused to make any sacrifice for
his alma mater

  no sacrifice is too great for me
now said thorne in a low tone i
have acted the cad and the coward but
i understand things better what can
i do for oberlin 

  ohio wesleyan will push us for the
meet to-morrow explained the crafty
palmetter and one event may win or
lose for us you are sure of winning
the novice half we want to make cer-
tain of the open half mile our most
dangerous man is stanton of ohio
wesleyan who is a fast runner now
will you admit that i am more seasoned
and experienced in track generalship
than you a novice

  yes said thorne wondering what
was to come


top-notch magazine

  then said the captain firmly one
of us must sacrifice his hopes of win-
ning the open half mile by running to
let the other win if you will start a
wild sprint in the first quarter mile and
keep it up as long as you can stanton
will be carried away with it and will
run his head off in the first lap both
of you will hardly be able to finish and
if i have been running an even race
and holding for a final sprint i can pass
the winded stanton and win

  i understand replied thorne slow-
ly  you want me to sacrifice my hopes
of winning the open half mile by run-
ning myself out in the first of the race
so that stanton will run himself out
also and you can finish strong and win
the race do you give me your word
of honor that this will put stanton out
of the running and that it is for old
oberlin does he lose his head when
some one starts a sprint

  i give you my word said palmet-
ter eagerly he simply cant lay back
and watch another runner gain a big
lead are you willing to sacrifice your
chances of victory thorne

  without a moments hesitation the
new thorne gave his answer

  yes he replied simply i said that
no sacrifice is too great for me to make
now and i mean it

  ashamed of his action yet glad that
thorne had so readily agreed to give
up his hopes of winning the race pal-
metter hastened from the room

  it was all fixed now thorne would
run himself out early in the race and
stanton who had never shown himself
to be as fast as the watch had caught
either palmetter or thorne could be
easily defeated by the oberlin captain

  it was not true that stanton could
be persuaded to sprint his head off but
palmetter was sure of defeating him
it was the speedy thorne he had feared

  the next day was that of the big
open meet at oberlin college most
of the ohio colleges had entered men
but the contest for first honors seemed
to lie between oberlin and ohio wes-
leyan and so closely were they matched
that one event might decide the result
thorne found that he was to run in the

open half mile first and that there were
several numbers before the novice half
so that he would have time to rest

  palmetter was standing near the edge
of the track when he chanced to see a
big-framed man in earnest conversation
with coach kemp he recognized him
as bill parmalee the once famous
oberlin star now performing athletic
wonders for old yale

  he overheard what they were saying

  i scared the wits out of him
laughed parmalee by pretending i
was mentally unbalanced and making
him run me a half mile but let me tell
you he made me run my prettiest to
win i found that he was an oberlin
man and was not running for his col-
lege so i read him a lecture on college
spirit he told me he would run and
i see he is entered but let me tell you
why he would not run at first

  why not asked the coach and
palmetter listened

  i talked to his roommate a while
ago continued parmalee and i
learned that by dint of clothes press-
ing tutoring and book selling thorne
is barely paying expenses here he is
ambitious to get a college course but
he cant save any money ahead to
come out each afternoon and train as
he has done means that either he must
slight his studies or give up some of his
time in which he made money con-
sequently he has practically sacrificed
his next years stay at oberlin to run
for his college college spirit why
that fellow has more of it in his finger
than most of us in our worthless
hides

  palmetter gasped in dismay ras
soon as thorne had learned that his
views were mistaken ones he had made
this big sacrifice cheerfully he had
done this for the college he had come
to love while palmetter was sacrificing
oberlins glory for his own personal
ambition

  in that instant the senior saw how
mean and small he was in the light of
the sophomores abnegation and he re-
solved to do right

  coach kemp he said bravely i
have been a cowardly cur and i ought
for the glory of oberlin



to be kicked out of college but i know
that i was a sneak and i shall make
amends before it is too late

  then he courageously told of his de-
ceit and bill parmalees heart grew
glad as he saw the fruits of the seeds
he had sown in thornes mind the
track captain finished his confession
and the clasp of the coachs hand told
him that his repentance was believed

  hike right over and tell thorne
how to run the race said bill parma-
lee heartily hurry your open half
is about to start and after the meet
ill have something to tell donald
thorne that will make him happy
now beat it to him palmetter

  but it was too late as palmetter
neared the starting line the pistol was
raised in air and he had barely time to
shout his name to the clerk of the
course and get on his mark the shot
sounded and together the two oberlin-
men leaped out with stanton clinging
at thornes side palmetter had don-
alds promise to run himself out for the
purpose of exhausting stanton and
with this in mind the sophomore pre-
pared to start a mad sprint

  as he ran donald thorne was think-
ing over and over to himself

  college spirit is sacrificed for my
college i shall lose the race to my cap-
tain 

chapter iv

the unexpected

that half-mile race will go down in
 the history of oberlin as the most
sensational track event ever seen on the
athletic park oval

  within fifty yards from the start
donald thorne on whom the coach re-
lied to win the race startled and dis-
mayed the rooters by sprinting madly
foot by foot he drew away from the
field and so engrossed was he in the
thoughts of the sacrifice he was making
that he did not notice he had quickly
shaken off stanton only the coach and
parmalee besides the two oberlin run-
ners knew the meaning of this mys-
terious dash of thornes

cua

 the ohio wesleyan man had been
surprised by thornes action but
knowing that he was a novice he at-
tributed it to nervousness and inexperi-
ence and he kept on with a steady
stride at the end of the first quarter
thorne was far in the lead but his
wind was going fast and at times he
staggered slightly

  then stanton began slowly and
steadily to increase his speed and pal-
metter drew up beside him almost
frantic with remorse the oberlin cap-
tain knew that he mustwin the race or
he would have helped to defeat his
college

  what can thorne be thinking of
the surprised students asked each other

  he was still keeping up that heart-
breaking sprint and as he flashed
around the track three hundred yards
from the tape even stanton awoke to
the factthat there was a big lead to be
cut down and he let out his power in
a fast finish sprint

  i must beat him breathed palmet-
ter and he too cut loose and threw his
reserve strength into a fast dash to-
gether they gained rapidly on the fal-
tering thorne and the oberlin crowd
burst into a cheer as they saw their cap-
tain forge into the lead and then-

  palmetters right foot slipped as he
stepped into a hole dug by some sprint-
er for the start of tne hundred-yard
dash and his ankle turned a sharp
pain shot through the injured member
and he went down on one knee

  in a second he struggled up and was
fighting gamely on but despite his grim
determination to finish he was forced
to limp as he ran and the ohio wes-
leyan man left him quickly in the rear
of all this the tired thorne was in ig-
norance he heard the shouts of the
spectators but he believed that his cap-
tain was passing the supposedly fa-
tigued stanton whom he had thought
to be giving out in keeping up with his
sprint

  he heard the patter of spikes behind
him and he sighed with relief in an
instant more palmetter would flash by
him and break the tape in the race he
could have won


top-notch magazine

  a form loomed up at his side and
then went to the front he stared for
he saw the well-known jersey of the
ohio wesleyan man

  the two of them were well ahead of
the field and fifty yards from the tape
palmetter still limping along was
keeping ahead of the rest and seemed
fairly sure of holding his lead and get-
ting third place if only he could have
taken first and the tired thorne third
but now stanton would take the race
and the five points unless by some
miracle thorne beat him out

  stanton was tiring now he had al-
lowed thorne to gain a great lead and
the sprint to catch him had taken all of
his strength physically he was a shade
better than his rival but he lacked the
great awakening that had come to
donald

  he uttered a sharp gasp of ponder
as the oberlin man crept even with
him and then went slowly past gamely
he battled to regain the lost few inches
but they crossed the line in the same
positions as they ran the last five yards
and palmetter won third place by fully
as gallant a fight

  hurrah

  it was big bill parmalee the yale
star who caught the almost-fainting
thorne in his arms think of it old
man you ripped off that half in a min-
ute and fifty-nine seconds it is a new
state record we thought the race was
lost when you started that mad dash
but you pulled out how did you ever
keep up at the finish 

  college spirit  panted donald with
a happy smile i knew i had to win
for oberlin and i did it

  then he learned of palmetters
mishap and the repentant captain made
a clean breast of his treachery and re-
ceived thornes freely granted forgive-
ness

  i was eager to win the point cup
said palmetter and i tricked you into
running yourself out so i could beat
you but before the race i learned of
how you sacrificed your chances of
next year here to run for oberlin and
i saw what a mean sneak i was i
tried to tell you before the race but i

was too late i hurt my ankle and you
ran a wonderful race thorne

  i have been a fool too confessed
thorne i was bitter because i had
to work all my spare time when others
could loaf and get into athletics i con-
demned them for it and i had no
friends now that i have learned what
it is to sacrifice and work for my col-
lege i am happy i dont know how i
am going to earn money for college
next fall but something may turn up
something has turned up said bill
parmalee you just run your best for
oberlin this season my kid brother
needs tutoring this summer to get him
ready for college in the fall you shall
come and stay with vis and not a cent
shall it cost you so you can save your
salary not a word he needs a tutor
and you are the man for the place
when you get ready to come to yale
we sons of old eli will stand by you
thorne

  palmetter was sincerely happy that
thornes sacrifice was rewarded and
that his hopes of the next year at col-
lege were not dashed because of his act
in running for oberlin he held out
his hand to donald

  go in now and win the novice half
and the point cup he said ill carry
off the shot put but your first in the
two races beats me i dont deserve
the cup and you do

  the coach smiled as he interposed

  i think you do deserve it now pal-
metter you are a senior and donald
has other chances at it anyhow he
cannot run in the novice half now for
the moment he crossed the tape and
won the open half he became an ama-
teur and lost his novice standing so
if you win the shot put youll have six
points to his five and the cup is yours
i am glad exclaimed thorne my
own victory for oberlin is all i want
palmetter i may come back here an-
other year before i go to yale and ill
have a chance to win the cup next
spring i am glad you will win it now
and another thing said coach
kemp all palmetters alarm about
your running a faster half than you
did was needless when i timed you

                       s
for the glory of oberlin



the other day i had just snapped the
watch on a quarter-miler in fifty-seven
seconds so i started it from that point
on you and as the hand went around
twice and i caught you at sixty your
time was two minutes and three sec-
onds or a second slower than your rec-
ord to date

  well gasped palmetter so my
time was better than his and yet i tried
to keep him out of the race what a
jealous fool i was

  i dont think i can ever run it again
as fast as i did to-day said thorne
seriously it was my awakening that
sent me so fast but i am ready to
help oberlin win the two-mile race
from miami

  a few minutes later he walked from
the field big bill parmalee was on one
side of him and ralph palmetter had
thrown an arm across his shoulders
he felt all the old bitterness gone from
his heart and life forever

  now he was one of them united by
that great desire to work for old ober-
lin even the buildings took on a new
meaning as he gazed  them

  as he neared dascomb cottage a
group of students burst into a joyous
chorus

  for hes a jolly good fellow which
nobody can deny

  and this time donald thorne was
thrilled for he knew that they were
singing of him

why of course

by james edmond casey

how easy when it is all over to see just what was in the wind all the time

he stout loud-waistcoated
man struck out of the swirl
of the broadway crowd and
into the dazzling jewelry store
of radlang  co at oak-
land california

  i want to buy a diamond ring for
my daughter he informed the first
clerk behind the polished glass counter
doubtless youve read about my daugh-
ter and her coming marriage he pomp-
ously went on as his thick fingers fum-
bled amid the array of rings dorothea
de los obrien you know im pedar
de los obrien and he proffered a
card

  the clerk was astounded for he
had judged the man from appearances
and manner a cheap sport or politician
of the prosperous saloonkeeper brand
but de los obrien that was a name
to conjure with across the bay in san
francisco here in oakland obrien
was known only by reputation as the
lumber and shipping king of the pacific
coast

  this about hits what i want the
expensively though flashily dressed mr

de los obrien held up a plain band
gold ring set with a handsome diamond
what may be the price of this

  two hundred and ten dollars sir
without another word the portly
money king drew out as portly a wallet
but after a quick examination of its
contents it appeared something was
wrong mr de los obrien looked up

  i have only a hundred and sixty-five
dollars here he explained and
worse luck i havent my check book on

me but-oh i forgot- and he

withdrew from another recess of the
wallet a crisp pink check

  he handed that to the waiting clerk
this is for one thousand dollars he
said you can take it out of that
but the clerk seemed doubtful

  i dont think we can cash it he
hesitatingly explained you see sir
it is a rule with us never to accept a
check for more than the amount of the
purchase but if youll pardon me a
moment ill see mr radlang the boss
and find out just what we can do for
you in this case

  quickly the clerk reappeared in the


top-notch magazine

wake of a small gray wizened man
who was red of face and evidently an-
gry-

   look here sir said this little per-
son leaning across the glass case you
sure have got your nerve with you
coming in here and trying to work off
a bad check and pocket the change but
im too wise to fall for any such old
game as that tut tut i dont care
who you say you are i never saw you
before in my life but i think you-

  thatll do sir the portly man
had drawn himself up indignant
youve gone far enough so i am
trying to swindle you-i pedar de los
obrien ill have you to know sir
that i could buy your store ten times
over and never feel it bad check i
wouldnt have offered it only i never
for a minute thought there was any one
in business in oakland who didnt know
pedar de los obrien of san fran-
cisco

  the strangers hurt confident man-
ner and his quiet repetition of that
powerful name all had an effect on the
little jeweler he calmed down with
surprising suddenness and when he
spoke again it was in a more reasonable
tone of voice

  but cant you see its a business
proposition mr de los obrien rad-
lang expostulated my attitude is only
businesslike and perfectly proper per-
sonally i would take your word for it
and cash your check right now but
that isnt good business

  mr de los obrien saw that

   youre right he said youre per-
fectly right but just the same it
roiled me a bit to be mistaken for a
swindler suddenly his face bright-
ened as though with an inspiration
jingo he explaimed ill tell you
what ill do i cant let you take my
word for it and cash this check no
that isnt good business as you say
but ill prove to you who i am and
that will show i am far above commit-
ting any swindle

  his enthusiasm was contagious

  how from radlang what is
it

  this just this im going away for

a few days-up to eureka to look over
some shipments of timber ill call in
when i return in the meantime you
can find out whether my check is good
by putting it through the bank you
will keep both check and ring till i look
in again now what do you think of
it

  the jeweler failed to see how he ran
any risk so long as he retained both
check and ring added to this his curi-
osity had been aroused in regard to his
would-be customer for his own bene-
fit he wanted to determine the true
status of the man

  i guess the old fellows pedar de
los obrien all right after all he said
to himself as he indorsed the check and
inclosed it with others for the banks

  and as the days passed the stronger
his convictions grew that the check was
good why otherwise should the port-
ly stranger so desire to have it put
through and proven imagine his sur-
prise then when three days later the
check for one thousand dollars came
back from the bank on which it was
drawn with a little slip attached which
read no funds

  well i see it all now the jeweler
said communing with himself after the
first shock he was just saving his
face by trying to make good on his
bluff anyhow ill keep this as a souve-
nir of pedar de los obrien or what-
ever his real name is for i know ill
never see him again

ii

that very afternoon who should

  	stride largely into the store but
the smiling portly mr pedar de los
obrien

  well how about that check of
mine were his first words

  radlang broke into that i-told-you-
so smile so common after elections and
prize fights without a word he laid
before the stranger the pink check and
the attached no funds slip

  a look of blank amazement came
over the others face he studied the
check as though unable to believe- the
evidence of his eyes then of a sud-
why of course



den he burst out laughing his ample
stomach heaving up and down and his
broad face going red with merriment

  well and no wonder  he exclaimed
when he had regained sufficient control
of himself no wonder it came back
i asked the clerk up at my hotel for a
blank check on my bank-and he gave
me this why it is drawn on the
wrong bank ha ha no wonder it
came back but no matter-

  he drew out his now well-filled
wallet and deposited the check therein
then he withdrew two one-hundred-
dollar bills and a gold eagle which he
tendered amid profuse apologies in
payment for the diamond ring

  i guess you wont object to taking
this kind of money he laughed and
popketing the ring he departed

  behind him he left a sadly muddled
little gray jeweler what in the world
radlang asked himself was beneath all
this jugglery that something was
afoot he felt in his bones but what it
was old business man though he was
he could not tell he had an uncom-
fortable feeling of being the victim of
an exceedingly clever swindler it was
uncanny like a premonition of danger
but all he could do to combat it was to
breathe the hope that he had seen the
last of the suave well-fed mr pedar
de los obrien of san francisco

iii

it was the intention of the portly
check giver that he should see no
more of the uncheatable mr radlang
yet that fact did not account for his
going to another jewelry store that day

  it appears that radlang was not the
only jeweler in oakland whom pedar
had favored with his patronage for
when he called at hatton  jenkils
diamond palace that afternoon the
head of the firm mr jenkil gave him
a nod of recognition

  the store was pretty full with the
saturday afternoon shopping crowd
de los obrien went to the repair
counter presented a ticket and received
a diamond ring which he had left there
to be reset he had decided to give this

commission to hatton  jenkil after
mr radlang had cruelly refused to
favor him with change in real money on
the thousand-dollar check

  strangely enough however the
usually wise pedar de los obrien had
not profited by that humiliating experi-
ence for here he was standing at the
cashiers window bill for the resetting
of the ring in hand and again tendering
that scorned thousand-dollar check in
payment

  to be sure the check now bore the
indorsement of a certain financially
sound jeweler-mr radlang to be
exact

  mr jenkil who was taking cash that
day said after examining the check on
both sides

  i beg your pardon sir but we have
never done business with you except to
the extent of resetting this ring and
this is rather a large check-one thou-
sand dollars-to offer in payment for
that service there would be nine hun-
dred and seventy-eight dollars change
mr pedar de los obriens face be-
gan to take on that look of indignation
which he could so easily summon to his
aid he did not have a chance to speak
for noting the change in his counte-
nance mr jenkil went on in a con-
ciliatory tone

  as mr radlang has indorsed this
check and put his o k on it it must
be good its after banking hours as
you say and there is no other way you

can cash the check so-

  he did not finish the sentence in-
stead he stepped off his high seat
backed out of the cash cage slammed
the grated door behind him and stepped
briskly to the rear of the store where
there was a telephone

  de los obriens first impulse was to
beat it but by the time he got to
the door he reflected that he might be
throwing away a chance to get that nine
hundred and seventy-eight dollars
change

  he had lived on chances several
years and his waist measurement had
increased steadily chances were his
stock in trade the present one was
rather desperate he had to admit he

knew that jenkil had gone to the phone
to ask radlang about his indorsement
of that check of course-well time
enough to lay down your cards when
you see the other chap has you beaten

  mr de los obrien decided to remain
just where he was standing at the door
and when jenkil came away from the
phone he would be able to see from the
mans face just what had happened-
whether the reply had come from rad-
lang himself exposing the attempted
game or whether the reply had come
from a clerk radlang being absent

  de los obrien had figured that it
was about time for radlang to be ab-
sent from his store on his way to the
ball game if some one else answered
the inquiry the information given
about the check might be such as to
make jenkil waver and possibly cash it
a slim chance to be sure but a chance
nevertheless and mr de los obrien
did not find it in his heart to throw it
away if it became necessary to beat a
swift undignified retreat he had a taxi-
cab awaiting him

  so he stood by the door pretending
to be looking at articles of jewelry but
really with his sharp eyes fixed on the
telephone and the man before it

  presently mr de los obrien saw the
jeweler rattling the hook excitedly and
heard him crying hello repeatedly
evidently the connection had been
broken before his talk was finished with
whomever the person was who had an-
swered the call

  after a while jenkil hung up the re-
ceiver and walked back to the cashiers
cage an annoyed look on his face the
watcher at the door saw him take up
the check again put it in a drawer and
begin counting out the cash

  expanding his chest with renewed
courage and a tolerant smile on his am-
ple countenance mr pedar de los
obrien moved toward the cashier to
receive his hard-earned change

iv

dadlang the rich jeweler but poor
casher of strange checks was an
ardent baseball fan it was his delight
on saturday afternoons to take off his

collar and sweat on the grand stand
rooting riotously for the oakland team
usually he was accompanied by a man
the public believed his bitterest rival
mr jenkil of jenkil  hatton manu-
facturing and retail jewelers of broad-
way

  radlang was about to call up his
friend to see if he were going to the
game that afternoon when a call came
from jenkil himself

  say radlang came over the wire
theres a man named pedar de los
obrien here with a check for a thou-
sand dollars bearing your indorsement
did you indorse it 

  by the time jenkil had got to his
question radlang was so excited that
he burst into hysterical laughter oh
yes i indorsed it he answered his fin-
gers twitching so that he could scarcely
hold the receiver to his ear oh yes
but dont you pay it jenkil dont you
take it ill be right around hold the
scoundrel and ill pick up a policeman
on the way and well have him locked
up be sure you hold him now get
me

  there was no response

  jenkil  shouted radlang into the
transmitter do you understand

  still no answer then the jeweler be-
gan to rattle the hook just as jenkil was
doing at his end blessing the girl at
central and realizing that there was not
a moment to be lost radlang caught up
his hat and tore out of the store

  afraid of missing the first of the
game sneered one of the clerks

  yes chimed in another the boss
is getting to be a bigger bug every day
on baseball

  as radlang dashed through the street
it all came to him in a staggering flash
it was plain to him now that the pur-
chase of the diamond ring and the put-
ting through of the one-thousand-dollar
check was only a brilliant scheme to get
his good indorsement on a worthless
check then the portly swindler by
means of having a ring reset or some-
thing had scraped a business acquaint-
ance with jenkil and now in payment
he was proffering that bad check with
the excuse that he could not change it
why of course



elsewhere because the banks were
closed

  and poor jenkil was falling for the
swindle-until he had been told not to
pay it a horrible thought entered rad-
langs mind had jenkil heard that part
of the message had it reached him
before the connection was broken 

  with a cold shiver from head to foot
the little gray jeweler vaulted into con-
trol of himself he arrived at the store
and stepped forward just in time to
block the way of mr pedar de los
obrien

  but the latter was not in the trade of
swindling business men because of any
lack of brains on his part or presence
of mind his right hand shot forward
to grasp that of mr radlang

 why how dye do he beamed
so glad to meet you again but im
in a fierce hurry to get a train for los
angeles good-by

  but the jeweler though a small man
held so tightly to the swindlers hand
that he could not wrench away

  not so fast mr obrien he said
loudly to attract attention and help
it was a close shave but i got you by
the skin of my teeth and ill trouble
you before i hand you over to the po-
lice to return mr jenkil his one thou-
sand dollars

  wrong again sir returned pedar
still calm although a policeman now ap-
peared at the door the amount is
nine hundred and eighty-seven as well
be precise in business matters

bank of englands night guard

aisitors in london who happen to
v be in the vicinity of the bank of
england at about half past six in the
evening may witness one of the most
interesting customs in that city for it is
at that time that a detachment of armed
guards march into the bank with fixed
bayonets for the purpose of guarding
the twenty million pounds in gold and
silver with which the vaults of the old
lady of threadneedle street are usu-
ally stocked

  this custom dates back to the gor-
don riots of  when it was deemed
necessary to call in soldiers to prevent
the mob raiding the bank since then
the bank has been protected every night
by a detachment of guards

  the detachment usually numbers
about thirty men in parade dress with
fixed bayonets and loaded ammunition
belts in charge of two sergeants and a
lieutenant these are the only troops
that have the privilege on ordinary oc-
casions of marching through the city
of london with fixed bayonets

  for guarding the bank the soldiers re-
ceive extra pay which is given to them
as soon as they enter the bank each
night privates and drummer boy get
one shilling each corporals one shilling
six pence and sergeants two shillings
six pence this sum is exclusive of the

subalterns allowance the aggregate
cost of guarding the bank of england
is about one thousand pounds per an-
num

  the bank authorities do all they can
for the soldiers comfort they provide
them with extra blankets for the win-
ter and a selection of books while the
lieutenant in charge has a snug little
room a dinner being brought in to him
from a neighboring tavern he is also
allowed to entertain two guests the
only stipulation being that they must
depart before midnight

  failing any emergency call the ma-
jority of the soldiers merely perform
sentry go onc a night for an hour
they are posted throughout the rooms
of the bank and in the courts the sen-
tries being increased in the middle of
the night and remaining on duty till the
detachment returns to barracks at six
oclock in the summer and seven in the
winter

  with regard to the lieutenant there
is a curious stipulation that he shall only
have one bottle of wine for himself and
two for each of his guests while the
regulation is that each soldier shall not
be allowed more than one pint of stout
from the small canteen which has been
established inside the bank for the con-
venience of the night guard	ft

a hurry call

n electric bell trilled on the
  floor of the hospital where the
  quarters of the house staff
  were located and was heard
  faintly by doctor denzil and
  doctor gresham as they sat reading in
  the library on the top floor

  denzil started slightly as he heard it
but continued to study with his head
bowed low over a textbook on medical
jurisprudence

  gresham smiled quietly and waited a
moment

  hear the bell stephen the bus
is going out he said dryly using the
expression of the medical vernacular
for what the layman knows as an
ambulance

  yes confound it cried denzil
springing to his feet and clapping the
book shut i might have known the
bus would go out if i didnt want to
bone for that exam there wouldnt be
a call to-night

  doctor denzil the ambulance is
waiting said a low-voiced nurse step-
ping into the room

  yes miss morton thank you an-
swered denzil with polite irony i
gathered as much from hearing the
bell and im delighted

  without further delay he ran down
the stairs to his room clapped the uni-
form cap of the hospital service on his
head slipped a raincoat over his white
ducks and ran on to the courtyard
catching up the emergency bag and
grabbing the official record slip of the
call from an orderly as he passed
through the receiving ward

  the ambulance was standing just
within the gates and the big gray horse
was pawing the air and champing its bit
restively but as doctor denzil ap-
peared the driver gave the horse its
head and the ambulance whirled out
into the street the surgeon catching the
hand strap and landing on the tail board
in a flying leap

  its a hurry call doctor shouted
pat kelly the driver as he let the great
horse out to its long free lope

  so i see pat answered denzil
holding the official slip up to the light
of the lantern

  up to the north end the clerk
said added the driver
the vanishing ambulance



  um yes a good way out too said
the doctor squinting at the paper its
number fifty-nine beaver street youd
better let up on your horse a bit

  the ambulance whirled through the
quiet city streets and the big gong un-
der the busy foot of pat kelly woke
the echoes as well as some of the early
sleepers

  doctor denzil presently climbed over
the back of the drivers seat and took
the place beside the good-humored
irishman

  i hated like the deuce to come out
to-night pat he said sociably i had
just settled down to study hard for
that exam to-morrow when the bell
rang now its a cinch that til get no
more study to-night

  ah dont ye be worry in doctor
denzil said pat encouragingly its
no fear i have sir that yell not get
th appointment but between you an
me sir its doctor fraser id be hatin
to see gettin it

  denzil laughed without much mirth
i guess doctor fraser is all right
pat he replied with some restraint
but he feels his authority a bit too
keenly for a man just graduated
sure hes after thinkin im his
coachman when hes on the bus sir
growled pat the airs the man puts
on sir would be makin ye think we
was ridin in a bayrooch stead of a
horspitl bus

  never mind-pat maybe hell tone
down a little if he gets the appoint-
ment murmured denzil absently
hospital life is good training for any
man

  ah bad cess to im muttered the
driver with yet franker feeling ive
got me fingers crossed agin his gettin
it git ap jerry hoss and he
banged the gong violently as though he
had the despised doctor fraser under
the pedal

  they were out of the thickly settled
districts now and among the scattering
houses of the outskirts

  pull up pat ordered denzil sud-
denly  beaver street is the next
turn

  but pat scarcely checked the leaping

horse and the ambulance rounded the
turn into beaver street on two wheels

  now for number fifty-nine cau-
tioned denzil

  ill spot it sir assured pat the
numbers begin at the other end

  in another minute he pulled up with
a jerk in front of a somewhat ram-
shackle cottage thisll be number
fifty-nine doctor he said i ray-
member coinin before to number fifty-
three

  denzil caught up the emergency bag
dropped from the tail board and ran
up the garden path to the house there
was a dim light burning at one of the
windows but the cottage had a bare
look as of a place untenanted

  as the ambulance surgeons footfall
sounded on the rickety porch the door
was flung open and a large man
bearded and in rough clothing ap-
peared in the doorway holding an oil
lamp aloft and peering into the outside
darkness

  roach live here is this number
fifty-nine queried denzil

  ah thank heavens youve come
doctor exclaimed the man he was
took awful bad bout two hours ago

  well who is he and where is he
demanded denzil with the curtness of
the busy public physician

  right this way doctor said the
man leading the way to an inner room
hes my brother-in-law his name is
greene my but hes been takin on
somethin terrible you was a long
time cornin doctor

  got here as fast as the horse could
run replied the doctor as he followed
the big man into the dimly lighted
room and peered curiously at another
huge fellow who was doubled up gro-
tesquely on a rough couch groaning
and panting stertorously

  now take it easy and tell me whats
the matter said denzil to the sufferer
as he laid off his overcoat and placed
the emergency bag on the floor

  the man on the couch rolled his head
wildly from side to side and laid a
hand tenderly upon his abdomen

  the doctor bent over and pressed


top-notch magazine

gently upon the spot indicated hurt
much he inquired gently

  the redoubled groans answered him
clearly

  an acute inflammation-probably
said denzil tersely then turn-
ing to the other man this isnt
necessarily a hospital case but you
dont seem to have very good facilities
for taking care of the man i guess
we may as well take him back with us
it give him something to quiet the
pain now

  the sick man squirmed protestingly
and managed to mutter no no no
between his groans

  he dont like to take dope ex-
plained roach hes got a heart trou-
ble doctor an dope near did for im
once

   well if you can stand it till we get
to the hospital said denzil im sat-
isfied but theres no need of your
suffering so i wont harm your heart

  the man continued to wag his head
and protest so the doctor made no ef-
fort to give temporary relief but
stepped quickly out of the room and to
the door

  oh pat he called back the bus
up to the porch wall you and then
bring in the litter

  he went back to the side of the sick
man and counseled him to keep calm
and agitate himself as little as possible
and presently pat kelly came quietly
into the room with the litter which he
opened and placed on the floor

  the doctor and the driver quickly
lifted the patient with the deftness of
experienced hands and placed him gen-
tly upon the litter the man roach
offered to lend a hand but denzil
waved him aside

  kelly and i know just how to han-
dle this thing he said so dont you
bother about it mr roach

  having settled the man as comfort-
ably as possible the doctor and the
driver lifted the litter and started
slowly for the door kelly leading and
denzil supporting the rear handles

  but at that moment something hap-
pened which is not included in an am-
bulance surgeons daily program

  the big fellow roach following in
the rear suddenly whipped a blackjack
from his sleeve and felled denzil with-
a quick blow

  the young doctor staggered back-
ward and fell the rear end of the
litter dropped the patient who had
seemed so helpless sprang to his feet
with astonishing agility and joined
roach in grappling with the surprised
kelly who was taken utterly unawares

chapter ii

for ransom

hen doctor denzil regained con-

  	sciousness he found himself lying
on the floor of the room in which the
bogus patient had lain his hands and
feet were tied firmly and uncomfort-
ably and there was a gag in his mouth

  he noted that it was still night and
upon turning his head to the right he
saw a clock upon the mantel whose
hands indicated the hour of eleven he
turned his head to the left and dis-
covered pat kelly similarly bound and
gagged lying upon the couch

  kelly was looking at him fully con-
scious and his eyes were vividly elo-
quent they expressed clearly his
views upon the awkward situation and
sparkled darkly with predictions of
events to follow

  the two prisoners were alone in the
ill-furnished room with the ticking
clock and the smoking oil lamp but
vague sounds came from outside the
cottage and denzil presently made out
muffled voices and the stamping of a
restive horse-undoubtedly jerry of the
ambulance

  a quarter tour passed with increas-
ing torture for the trussed and help-
less prisoners and then roach and
greene-as the former had given their
names-came in hurriedly picked up
kelly snorting with fury  and bore him
out of the house

  they returned directly and carried
denzil out in the same manner and
placed him none too gently beside
kelly in the ambulance-in his own
bus

  roach sat on the tail board to guard
the vanishing ambulance



the prisoners and greene mounted to
the drivers seat and started jerry at
a trot out of the yard and down the
broad macadam street toward the open
country the lantern and side lights of
the ambulance had been extinguished
and greene was careful that no acci-
dental movement of his feet should
wake the gong to action

  denzils head was sore from the blow
of the blackjack and it throbbed
cruelly but his senses wrere keenly alert
and when the ambulance stopped at
last he roughly estimated that it had
traversed something like ten miles

  the smell of the sea came to his nos-
trils and when he was lifted out of
the ambulance he saw by the faint
light of the early dawn a low dilapi-
dated fishermans hovel and a rudely
constructed barn close beside it

  the two victims of the mysterious
nights work were laid on the floor of
the hovel and left alone again for a
half hour denzil heard noises which
indicated that jerry was being stabled
and the ambulance concealed from the
view of possible intruders

  toward daylight the two ruffians
came into the house and removed the
gags from the prisoners mouths kel-
ly exploded in such a wealth of invec-
tive that instead of impressing the cap-
tors as he desired he only succeeded in
amusing them

  dont waste your breath pat said
denzil speaking for the first time we
must keep cool old man

 and then he turned his eyes
scathingly upon the two men that stood
over him

  what do you blackguards want
anyway he demanded with cold
calmness

 roach laughed almost good-hu-
moredly never mind the compli-
ments doctor he said we can state
the case pretty easy without any fuss

  it aint a very common thing to
kidnap grown men and i suppose all
this ambulance business looks like we
went to a great deal o trouble but
thats our lookout we figgered it all out
beforehand

   taint generally known i believe

but we happened to know that youve
got a rich brother that thinks a heap
of you-edgercated you an set you up
for a doctor an all that hell pay
up at our price when he finds out his
brother is in all kinds o trouble

  course we took quite some trouble
an risk but we been watchin you for
some time an we found out there
want much hope of gettin you away
from the horspitl cept on the ambu-
lance the irishman is no good to us
but we got to keep im as long as you
stay

  look here interrupted denzil
cringing under the torture of his bonds
i dont care for all the details of your
scheme ive got a few things to say
myself i wont waste any time in tell-
ing you what chances you two are tak-
ing with the law-you both ought to
know what it means to assault and ab-
duct two men steal a horse and inter-
fere with the ambulance service of a
city hospital-but ill tell you just what
it means to me

  yer cornin on fine doc remarked
the hitherto silent mr greene yer
a man after my own heart business is
business says i

  dont interrupt me said denzil
sharply i want as little talk with you
as i can have assuming that you ex-
pect to get ransom for me you cant
possibly communicate with my brother
and make any arrangements within
twenty-four hours hes in the woods
fishing out of the way of telephone
and telegraph

  thats all right said roach we
can wait our tracks are covered im
not afraid of the police locatin us here
for a week this place was made for
the job

  but i cant wait exclaimed denzil
impatiently under ordinary circum-
stances id see you fellows in tophet
before id make a move toward a com-
promise but my career for the next
two years depends on my presence at
the samaritan hospital to-day

  im not officially connected with the
hospital he continued im only sub-
stituting for another doctor but im in
line for appointment and its the most


top-notch magazine

valuable one in the state the competi-
tive examination takes place at two
oclock to-day and the appointment
practically lies between another man
and myself i have both professional
and personal reasons for beating the
other man-he has already tried to keep
me out of the race by fair means and
foul-and if i do not report to the ex-
amining board at two oclock i shall
lose the appointment by default

  heres my proposition he went on
earnestly ive got nine hundred dol-
lars in the bank and ill give you a
check for that amount now if youll re-
lease me ill stay here till one of you
goes to town and cashes the check and
then ill have time to get to the hos-
pital do this and ill consider the in-
cident closed and ill fix things all right
with kelly if you reject the proposal
why ill see that my brother has noth-
ing to do with the affair even if you
kill me but ill spend the rest of my
life if its spared in running you two
down and getting you right thats all
ive got to say

  hooroo fer you me lad cried pat
kelly its no ransom theyll get out
o mary kelly fer the likes o me an
im an awful bad feller when i get on
the track of a man

treatment for the doctor

the man greene had listened to den-

	zils statement attentively and he
showed signs of weakening but roach
spoke decisively

  youre a pretty fair lawyer doctor
he said sneeringly but ive got to tel
you that the proposition is declined
with thanks nine hundred dollars
wouldnt pay us for the fuss weve been
to already you just keep quiet an
well get a line on your brother quicker
than you think

  denzil flushed darkly and writhed
for an instant in impotent rage kelly
made the atmosphere sulphurous with
his remarks but succeeded mefely in
amusing the captors again

  theres more back of this than ap-

pears on the surface roach said den-
zil when he had recovered his com-
posure  theres a man higher up 
roach laughed irritatingly im
high up enough doctor he said
calmly this aint no corporation deal
a futile exchange of words went on
for another hour and then roach an-
nounced his intention to go to the city
and see what the police and the news-
papers were doing about the disappear-
ance of the two men and the ambu-
lance

  youll be all right here he said to
greene theres nothing to be done
yet only you mustnt talk to these
fellers-it wouldnt do no good an the
doctors a sharp one you leave him
for me to deal with ill be back here
in two or three hours

  the morning waned and the two
captives suffered untold mental tor-
tures to say nothing of pain from the
tightly laced fetters

  greene said denzil at last to the
silent watcher you are at least a man
with half a heart by your looks will
you do something for me-merely to
ease this torture  you dont know how
im suffering

  greene shifted his feet uneasily and
looked at the captives pale face

  i-i wont let up on them ropes a
bit he said with decision
 twouldnt do do yer want a drink
o water-either of yer

no greene i want some dope-
thats plain enough isnt it  answered
denzil tell me did you bring that
bag of mine along in the ambulance
greene fidgeted nervously

  yer bags in the nex room he said
after a minute

  well then you certainly wont be
taking any chances if you put me to
sleep for a few hours will you pur-
sued denzil with his eyes fixed intently
on the watery orbs of the jailer

  greene got up and shuffled into the
adjoining room returning at once with
the emergency bag

  i dont jes know what yer game is
he said hesitatingly but i dont see no
harm in putting yer to sleep howll
i do it
the vanishing ambulance



  thank you greene said denzil
simply open the bag please

  the man fumbled with the lock and
laid the large bag open disclosing an
assortment of instruments and several
rows of small vials

  the doctor raised his head painfully
and looked at the bag

  see that fourth bottle from this end
with the green label he asked well
greene i wish youd fill my hypodermic
with some of that liquid and give me
a shot of it then i can sleep for a
few hours in peace

  green got up from his kneeling posi-
tion and frowned peevishly

  oh i dont know nothin bout yer
hypodemics an things he protested
what do yer think i am a doctor
denzil sighed profoundly and im-
pressively

  its not a great favor to ask
greene he said if it took a doctor
to fill a hypodermic all the poor drug
fiends would have to smoke opium
now all you have to do is to unscrew
that needle draw the liquid up into the
barrel replace the needle give the pis-
ton a touch to press out the air bubble
and the thing is done

  greene was decidedly bored and he
muttered vaguely and scowled as he
condescended at last to follow the pris-
oners directions and fill the syringe

  now what do i do he asked fool-
ishly as he stood with the loaded hypo-
dermic in his hand

  well greene i dont think youd
better do very much more of the opera-
tion if your hand shakes like that an-
swered denzil youre a nervous
man this life of brigandage doesnt
agree with you my friend

  now suppose you put the hypo into
my hand  he continued with a certain
subtle authority im tied up pretty
tightly but i can manage two fingers
and a thumb i guess and then please
roll up that left trousers leg i cant
very well get at my own arm so well
try a shot in the leg if youll kindly
hold just a pinch of skin between your
thumb and finger remember greene
when you have a job like this you

mustnt put the needle into the muscle
-just get it under the skin

  the man put the syringe into the
cramped fingers of denzils right hand
and continued to grumble to himself as
he turned up the duck trousers until the
calf of the leg was exposed then as
denzil drew up his knees until he could
reach the calf the man tremblingly
picked up a fold of skin and held it as
he was directed

  now for relief cried denzil with
a strange wild gleam in his eye

  and with a movement like a light-
ning flash he struck the needle of the
hypodermic into the loose wrinkled
skin on the back of the mans hand
and pressed home the piston

  the burly ruffian gave a roar like a
wounded bull

  for an instant he hesitated in bewil-
derment and then sprang upon the
supine form of denzil

  ill kill you ill choke the life
outer yer fer that he bellowed

  and he proceeded to carry out the
threat his great hands closed on the
doctors throat and denzil felt his
breath and life slipping away from
him he struggled feebly but could
do nothing under the weight and
strength of the brute

  then-suddenly-the viselike clutch
weakened and relaxed an uncanny
gurgle came from the parted lips of
greene and he toppled over across the
body of denzil and lay inert

  pat kelly viewed the scene with eyes
of incredulous wonder but when he
saw the big fellow collapse and move
no more he let out a yell that brought
the half-conscious denzil to himself

  he stared about the room in a dazed
fashion for a minute then he regained
his faculties and wriggled from under
the dead weight of his recent assailant

  pat pat he cried  were free 
ive filled the man full of hyoscine
he cant wake for hours

  almost sobbing with excitement and
delight the surgeon rolled over and
over on the floor until he lay beside the
emergency bag

  there were gleaming keen-edged in-
struments lying temptingly within it


top-notch magazine

and it was but the work of a moment
for him to pick out a long curved
bistoury a knife with a blade like a
razor his hands were too cramped to
wield it freely but he managed to hold
it with some firmness as he drew up
his legs and sawed at the ropes on his
ankles half a dozen slashes severed
every strand and the prisoner was free
except for the cords that held his
wrists

  when he tried to stand up his legs
seemed paralyzed but the restored cir-
culation did its work rapidly and he
was soon able to free kelly from his
helpless position on the couch then
the wildly happy irishman seized the
knife and completed the liberation of
his comrade

  will ye looker that now cried the
ambulance driver suddenly in the midst
of frantic jubilation pointing at the
clock on the mantel

  great heaven its one oclock
pat answered denzil and his face
paled

  doctor cried the faithful driver
hopefully doctor lad if jerry hoss
is in that barn out there well beat yer
exams sir by a length

  out to the barn they staggered and
found the big gray horse and the am-
bulance and even with their be-
numbed fingers it was but the work of
five minutes to make the equipage ready
for the start

  pat said denzil well take our
friend greene with us and make sure
of handing him over to the police

  so they dragged the senseless body
of their late jailer from the house and
laid it in the ambulance

  were off pat shouted denzil
mounting the tail board

  an its a hurry call doctor re-
turned pat kelly from his seat

  and then he gave the word to jerry
and for the first time in months let
the big horse feel the sting of the whip

  suburban folk heard a mighty gong
clanging and the rush of a charging
horses hoofs but they reached their
windows and porches just in time to see
an ambulance whisk out of sight in the
distance

  over the macadam and asphalt of
the city the horse though almost spent
made even greater speed and the po-
licemen and horrified citizens shook
protesting fists from the sidewalk and
windows but pat could see the four
slender towers of the samaritan hos-
pital and nothing less than a stone wall
could have stopped him

  many people recognized the outfit as
the missing one the mysterious report
of which they had read in the morning
papers and policemen reporters and
curious citizens began a mad race for
the hosiptal

  pat pulled in his frenzied steed only
when dangerously near the hospital
gates and the ambulance rolled into
the courtyard with a clatter that
brought out the staff in a body

  doctor denzil swung down from the
tail board handed the emergency bag
to an orderly and bowed respectfully
to the house surgeon

  doctor he said to the latter i
have to report that i have brought in
the case after which we went last
night it is a case of an overdose of
hyoscine after treatment the patient
is to be turned over to the police to
answer charges of assault and battery
abduction and larceny i will make a
full report later in the day in regard
to my absence and that of driver kelly
and the bus

a chance shot

the examining board of the samari-

	tan hospital met at two oclock in
the hospital library

  there were fifteen applicants for the
new appointment of junior interne and
among them was the wealthy and in-
fluential young doctor fraser

  are all the men here who filed ap-
plications for this appointment in-
quired the elderly chairman

  doctor gilbert gresham who acted
as clerk glanced over his lists and said
reluctantly

  they are all here sir except doc-
tor stephen denzil and if youll par-
don me sir id suggest that the meet-
the vanishing ambulance



ing be asked to wait for a few minutes
i am sure doctor denzil will be pres-
ent

  this board never waits for appli-
cants who are not prompt said the
chairman testily and rapped on the
table with his gavel

  the board of examiners was declared
in session and then the clerk dis-
tributed examination papers among the
applicants

  doctor gresham was discouraged as
he viewed the aspiring physicians all
striving for the coveted hospital berth
his friend stephen denzil had com-
mitted an unpardonable breach in the
eyes of the hospital authorities he had
defaulted in a contest which meant
much to every ambitious beginner

  some said that the disappearance of
the ambulance surgeon driver and
horse was precisely of a color with
some of denzils early escapades in col-
lege and there were plenty to indorse
this view

  the class of applicants had been
writing busily for ten minutes when a
brisk step sounded from outside the
library door and doctor denzil walked
into the room and bowed to the chair-
man of the board

  a pencil clattered to the floor and
one of the applicants uttered an excla-
mation plainly heard by all

  stephen denzil-the devil he
said

  denzil whirled and looked at the
man and in his eyes he saw more than
mere rivalry and jealously ignoring
the dignity of the board in session he
strode round the table and leaned over
toward doctor fraser

  fraser he said incisively you
made a mistake you ignored the fact
that a man who has been bought still
has a price

  it was a random shot but it went
home fraser turned a sickly white
roach damn im  he cried

  and i have your other friend
greene in the receiving ward con-
tinued denzil he is not yet in fit
shape to be turned over to the police
pat kelly and i have had rather active
service during the last twelve hours
fraser got on his feet but he was
deathly pale and his chin quivered
weakly when he tried to speak

  i-i must go and see those-those
scoundrels he faltered they lied
to you denzil ill take oath i had noth-
ing to do with the affair

  what affair fraser asked den-
zil triumphantly

  but fraser strode out of the room
and clattered down the stairs

  denzil turned to the wondering
board of examiners

  mr chairman he said i beg to
offer you my apology for disturbing
the order of this session but i hope
you will allow that the circumstances
are unusual when you see the report i
shall submit to the house surgeon

  and i would further beg you sir
he continued to allow me to take this
examination as i shall prove to your
satisfaction that i was forcibly re-
strained from reporting to this board
at the time of assembly and that the
irregular events of the last eighteen
hours were the direct results of a con-
spiracy to discredit and dishonor me
i see no reason doctor denzil why
you should be barred from this exam-
ination under the circumstances an-
swered the chairman provided that
any decision of this board in your favor
shall be held pending the results of
whatever investigation may be made of
this mysterious affair

gave him the right tip

yl y dear friend i must ask you to lend me five dollars at once i have left
    my purse at home and havent a cent in my pocket

    i cant lend you five dollars just now but can put you in the way of getting
the money at once

    you are extremely kind

    heres a nickel ride home on the train and get your purse

       while standing idle

       sontract no -as a cer-
tain stretch of barge canal
work is officially known--was
a ten-miie length of resound-
ing bustle that afternoon to
the onlooker whose eye was not trained
there might have seemed to be confusion
along with this riot of activity but
there was not ever man had his task
cut out for him and performed it in an
orderly though by no means leisurely
way

   there was only one idler

   he stood at a middle point of the sec-
 tion or where the states new inland
 waterway breaks straight across the
 marshes deserting the old twisting
 erie canal

   the idler had footed it from rome
new york to the huge cofferdam at
oriskany

   he was tall wide-shouldered and
bronzed his flannel shirt was open at
the neck and his suspiciously clean cor-
duroys were tucked into high-laced
mud-stained boots his placid face and
steady eyes gave mute proof that the din
of the barking drills the shrieking

a serial novel

 dinkies and the creak of mighty ca-
 bles tightening over the donkey drums
 fell upon accustomed and unperturbed
 ears

   directly below him in a bed hollowed
 out by itself a great almost human
 dredge dug and lifted and dumped with
 unceasing regularity the idler had
 been watching it for perhaps half an
 hour when abruptly his eyes narrowed
 and a quick line furrowed either side of
 his mouth

   that brace will buckle on you in a
 minute he said addressing a foreman
 beside him who was engaged in sticking
 pins in a plat

   the foreman did not even look up
 the stranger took in a deep breath and
 bent his gaze once more on that portion
 of the steel wreb that shifted back and
 forth against the sky the dredge each
 time the dripping mud was lifted in the
 big shovel snorted wildly as though
 protesting against the strain and then
 swung about on its circular track de-
 positing the load down behind the big
 white concrete wing wall

   that brace is buckling he said
 again louder this time

   the foreman stuck in another pin and
 lifted his head

   did you make a noise

  i was merely warning you about
 that-
the barge canal mystery



  warning eh the foreman growled
well let me tell you young fellow
when i want warning on this particular
job ill take it from somebody who
knows his business

  a new color crept beneath the tan on
the younger mans cheeks his brown
fingers doubled at a critical moment
like this the others insolence was mad-
dening

  if youll be kind enough to take a
look at it he said trying to keep his
voice respectful you can see for your-
self 

  again the slim steel arm dipped and
lifted again the plume of steam shot
from the engine house again the idlers
eyes clouded

  it will drop right among those la-
borers  he cried out impulsively
heavens man are you deaf

  the foremans jaws came together
with a snap he thrust the map-pins
and all-into his pocket and took a few
steps nearer the younger man

  see here you he bawled whats
the answer  where do you geteff eh 
what you doing around this job any-
how  this aint the first time ive seen
you poking aboutv what are you try-
ing to find out eh

  i cant see that that is any of your
business the other returned in an even
tone this is a state towpath and i
dont think you or any other bull-necked
thick-headed boob can put me off im
minding my own affairs

  the devil you are shouted the now
thoroughly aroused foreman trying
to tell me my braces aint o k sup-
pose they aint wrhats that to you
nothing at all except that i dread to
see human lives unnecessarily sacrificed
those laborers down there will be
crushed

  a laugh that was half a snarl leaped
to the others lips

  whats one or two wops worth to
me anyhow he said theres six

after every job and as for you-

  he didnt finish his threat the
dripping bucket lifting from the marsh
bottom and swinging high over the
heads of the men below suddenly
caught there was a tearing as of a
a

dozen rivets snapping a cable broke
as cleanly as a bit of cord might break
between a mans hands the long
spiderlike arm bent double as if hinged

  the two men uttered simultaneous
cries the foremans was more of a
curse the strangers was one of rage
and contempt

  by all the good fortune in the world
the arm and the loaded bucket fell on a
solid concrete abutment the laborers
too frightened for words scampered in
all directions

  in a minute or two after the bucket
had rolled to a stop and the steel arm
tumbled firmly into a bed of soft con-
crete the calmer heads began to reason
orders were shrieked from one side to
the other men were venturing once
more into the hollow but cautiously

  standing on the high bank the fore-
man his face now like chalk his eyes
bulging stared dumbly ahead of him
the man who had warned him in vain
shrugged his shoulders put his hands
into his pockets and sauntered off with-
out a word when he had covered pos-
sibly twenty feet a voice sang out

  hey you

  the other gave no heed the hail
was repeated and then the foreman
came running up the towpath

  dont be in a hurry young fellow
he panted

  the idler turned

 what makes you change jour
mind he asked innocently

  the foreman stared into the latters
face youre no greenhorn at this
game are you 

  oh i might have taken a course in
engineering at a correspondence school

  why the canal man burst out pay-
ing no attention to the jest a buckling
brace was the only thing what could
have done this job how did you guess
it

  i dont guess about such things it
doesnt pay	

  what might your name be 

  it might be darion answered the
idler smiling

  the foreman frowned-then his face
brightened so it might he said
come along and work for me

on a silver platter

the man who had announced himself
as darion drew in a long breath
and squared his shoulders a job and
offered to him without being in the least
suggested what a contrast from form-
er experiences what a musical voice
that foreman had it rang so joyously
in his ears that darion felt he had to
hear it once more

  what was that last remark he
asked

  i want you to work for me im in
charge on this piece of work weve
got a tough proposition to buck up
against i need some good men what
do you say 

  for the moment darion had nothing
to say he lifted his eyes and swept a
glance away down the twisting length
of canal on either side of him the
construction work was in progress a
city seemed encamped in the valley
everything breathed the spirit of con-
quest-the conquest of nature

  this new hundred-million barge
canal an undertaking that equaled the
panama job a three-hundred-mile
course with its locks its bridges its
movable dams its monster retaining
walls its vast reservoirs what a privi-
lege to say that he had had even the
slightest hand in forming this matchless
waterway from the lakes to the tide

  he could not keep the flush from
springing to his cheeks nor his eyes
from sparkling at thought of the im-
pending battle the foreman read the
signs instantly

  start you at a hundred and fifty a
month

  darion allowed himself to calm down
he put aside the thought of the work
and faced the man

  i dont think i care to work for
you he said quietly

  the foreman confident of victory un-
til this last remark stepped back in sur-
prise

blamed independent arent you 

  somewhat

  ive got a list of sixty-odd men wait-
ing for just this same job the fore

man said old men mind you men
twice your age

  poor devils darion remarked sym-
pathetically thenhe tightened his belt
another notch somehow his stomach
felt peculiar-protesting against its
treatment

  at that moment before the other man
could continue with his arguments-or
drop the affair entirely owing to da-
rions apparent indifference-a bare-
headed sweating worker covered with
mud and the spatter from the air drills
below interrupted

  mr carreau he panted the engi-
neer of the dredge was hit by the cable
broken end smashed his ribs theyre
carrying him down to the doctor
carreau swore angrily johnson
knocked out that leaves a devil of a
hole in the force he whirled to face
darion once more you see how mat-
ters stand dont you im no fool
youve run a dredge havent you

  if you say so yes darion replied
weve got a new arm and cable
carreau burst out turning again to the
man who had brought up the report
get all the available men together and
get the dredge fixed up we cant waste
more than an hour hurry now

  the man darted away lurching and
slipping down the wet bank the fore-
man watched him for a second and then
faced darion

  the engine will be ready in an
hour

  thats good

  see here man carreau took da-
rion by the shoulder and fairly shook
him whats got into you youre an
engineer-i know that still you dont
seem to want to work come now i
need you on that dredge

  fifteen minutes ago you threatened
to run me off the ground darion re-
torted

  oh hang it all dont you under-
stand  i wasnt wise we have so
many know-it-alls hanging around here
slipping us advice

  i suppose so darion looked reflec-
tively at his finger tips but after this
when i mention a fact will you be kind
enough to pay attention
the barge canal mystery



  the drinks are on me ill remem-
ber said carreau and he laughed
weakly not quite certain as to the
others proposed determination

  darions heart was fluttering
strangely and his fingers already
seemed to be itching for the feel of a
throttle

  and please remember one thing mr
carreau he spoke out frankly one
important thing

  whats that

  i didnt ask for this job

  of course ill remember but whats

that got to do-

  no matter what happens darion
broke in bear it in mind no matter
what happens i didnt ask for this
job nor even hint for it did i you
gave it to me-forced it on me-handed
it out on a silver platter now dont
have a sudden loss of memory if this
ever comes up

  carreau frowned and appeared puz-
zled by the remark but it kept him
silent only for the moment he laughed
showing plainly that a load was lifted
from his mind

  i guess im wise he said and
im to call you darion eh 

  ill answer to that name admirably
darion passed a limp hand across his
forehead now lets get on the job

chapter iii

a confession

lithout being directed darion
v interested himself in the adjust-
ing of the new dredge arm and the sup-
porting cables with plenty of men on
the job the affair was of but an hours
duration during that time darion be- 
came as grimy as mud-spattered as his
companions he stopped only once
and then to straighten and take up an-
other- notch in his belt somehow the
excitement acted as a stimulant he
felt prepared to work an endless length
of time without a thought of resting

  once the dredge was again in work-
ing order darion climbed into the pilot
room nodded to the fireman seated
himself on the stool and tested the
numerous levers that projected about

all within arms reach the fireman
interested and plainly dubious as to the
new engineers ability watched him
closely

  the moment he saw the manner of
darions handling his eyes brightened
and he broke into a laugh

  i guess you dont need any advice
he said you have held down this sort
of job before havent you

  carreau seemed to think so darion
replied and then in quite another
tone he added whats your name
holt

  mines darion now lets get busy
carreau watching from the opposite
side of the flood wrall-the only stretch
of completed concrete on the job-
grinned to himself the huge bucket
on the end of the thin steel arm dipped
arose swept through the air in a half
circle and finally dumped its load of
dripping earth in exactly the right place

  that darions a real find carreau
told himself and i know em when i
see em too but he was devilish in-
dependent guess he dont have to
work unless he wants to only hope i
can keep him

  all the rest of the afternoon the big
dredge obeyed the strong brown fin-
gers of the new engineer at the throt-
tles not an accident marred its per-
formance not a hitch occurred in the
intricate maneuvers

  because of the necessity of getting
the swamp excavated before the frost
the work was being carried on with
three shifts working eight hours each
the accident to the dredge had occurred
shortly after the second shift had gone
on duty-that is the shift working from
two p m until ten the three crews
were known as the morning sundown
and graveyard shifts the first re-
ported at six a m and worked until
two p m the second came on and
worked until ten the last from then
until six

  when the dusk crept into the little
valley and the air became cooler-a
great relief to the men in the stuffy en-
gine room-the whole scene of opera-
tions was flooded with powerful daz-
zling-white carbide lamps each working


top-notch magazine

on the principle of a spotlight in a the-
ater and each circle overlapping the
other

  following this transformation car-
reau came down and stepped into the
pilot room for the moment

  hows everything darion

  the engineer scarcely lifted his eyes
from the low window that commanded
a view of the burrowing bucket

  all o k so far he answered
only i would suggest a plain scoop
bucket instead of this fish-mouth style
after we get through there into harder
soil

  carreau weighed the suggestion a mo-
ment not a bad idea not bad at all
i shall consider it say he went on
sharply as he noticed the engineer reel
a trifle in his seat whats the matter 
youre looking white about the gills
work too hard on you 

  darion tossed his head back and set
his teeth grimly he was conscious of
a dull roaring in his brain and some-
how his arm muscles were growing stiff
if only he could hold out until the fore-
man left

  nothing ails me he said quietly

  carreau frownett shrugged his shoul-
ders and went out no sooner had he
left the room than darion pitched for-
ward in his seat he had presence of
mind enough however to set his throt-
tle at rest the fireman holt peering
in from behind the boiler gave a sudden
exclamation and hurried forward

  whats up he said lifting darion
from the seat and stretching him full
length on the floor sick

  darion grinned and struggled erect
again bracing himself against the wall
of the room

  im-im a wee bit hungry he re-
plied i havent had a mouthful since
yesterday noon

chapter iv

a warning

at ten oclock the end of the shift
carreau called to darion and took
him back to rome in his motor boat it
was a clear stretch of sailing without
locks and the majority of the men on

the contract had their own boats for this
purpose finding it in fact more con-
venient than a car

  at stanwix hall the largest hotel in
the town and conveniently situated on
the old canal carreau saw that darion
was introduced and credit given him
the stanwix was headquarters for most
of the engineers

  an hour later carreau was in one of
the upstairs rooms in earnest conver-
sation with two associates he gave the
men a hurried sketch of the afternoons
adventure and ended up by saying that
the new man darion was a fortunate
find

 one of the men hammond-tall
thin-featured with peculiar black eyes
suggesting the japanese in fact he had
been nicknamed jap hammond-lis-
tened quietly to the foremans report un-
til darions name was mentioned then
he started and appeared interested

  say his names darion he asked
sharply

  thats what he said i might call
him carreau answered

  rather suspicious actions he had
dont you think said jap hammond
you know carreau we cant afford to
take many chances

  hes a blamed clever fellow car-
reau exclaimed and heaven knows i
need him on this contract he got more
real work out of the dredge in his shift
than the other engineer did in two

  but theres a risk hammonds
face darkened and he pounded a fist on
the table the state of new york
might be sending out a spotter-and this
idarion might be the man from what
ive heard from you he has acted like a
spotter

  well spotter or not he sticks car-
reau was firm on that point besides
he isnt working on our proposition
our land company has been formed for
the past three years and weve had clear
sailing havent we this seems a
rather late day for such a thing as
spies

  trubell the third member of the cir-
cle interrupted

  i slipped in from albany this morn-
ing he said and things look quiet
the barge canal mystery



enough around the capitol i guess
with my inside drag id be wised to any
attempt to pry into-certain deals
weve never quarreled since we
formed this partnership hammond
said our relations have been of the
smoothest but carreau i ask you to
get rid of this find as you call him
youre taking too big a chance
and youre asking me to cut my own
throat protested carreau j need ca-
pable engineers or ill get behind in my
work you know what the law is on
this point dont you  youre a lawyer
ive put up a seventy-five-thousand-dol-
lar bond if this job isnt completed by
next august ill forfeit a good bunch of
it-all the profits in fact i cant af-
ford to take the risk

  hammond left his chair and paced
back and forth across the room biting
on his cigar clasping and unclasping his
fingers abruptly he paused in front of
the table

  youve got to fire darion he burst
out

  impossible carreau said firmly
youll have the state down on us
when we close up this delta deal
snapped hammond

  ill forfeit all my profits if i continue
to let good men like darion out of my
service exclaimed carreau with just
as much spirit as the other

  well disclosure means more than a
little money it might mean-sing
sing

  trubell looked up quickly youre
a lawyer jap-thats why we let you in
on our proposition what goods a law-
yer if he cant keep people out of jail
this isnt a time for kidding ham-
mond sputtered this man darion
must go

  now see here carreau said try-
ing to smooth matters youre jump-
ing at conclusions you havent even
seen darion i tell you hes a clean-ap-
pearing sort of chap and i like his way
of going against a proposition now
youre a lawyer hammond and you
should be able to judge men fairly well
ill have him come up and you can dis-
cuss some matter with him and-

  youll do nothing of the sort

hammond interrupted in a tone that
amazed the foreman and trubell i-
i dont care to meet him just yet the
fact is-well i dont care to meet him

  carreau brightened then in that
case hed probably be glad to see you

  hammond threw the end of his cigar
into the wastebasket

  youll oblige me by not mentioning
to him that i am anywhere near this
town he snapped and if youre
stubborn enough to keep him on your
job carreau youll live to see the folly
of it thats all ive got to say good
night

  he left the room and slammed the
door behind him

chapter v

a game of poker

rarion ignorant of what had gone
on in the hotel that night got his
second wind as he expressed it and
proceeded to settle down to the steady
job of dredge engineer in this position
he assumed full charge and suggested
locations as to the moving of the dredge
when conditions should warrant it

  he seemed to know exactly how to go
about certain kinds of jobs the sort of
bucket to use for muck and the sort for
gravel how to swing the arm in the
right direction with the least possible
amount of energy and to dump the
waste in the proper space for it as
there were two dredges on the contract
a friendly rivalry sprang up between
the operators of them but week by
week darions machine ran far in the
lead

  holt the fireman appeared to take a
new lease of life with the coming of
darion formerly the engineer had seen
the fireman when off shift hanging
around saloons and gaming places in
rome and had tried to show him the
error of such ways that his endeav-
ors were bearing fruit was proven when
one day darion met the mans sister
nora

  she was barely eighteen and had
lived all her years in the country she
was simple straightforward in manner
her personality immediately impressed


top-notch magazine

the engineer it was her practice to
ride in from the farm above rome on
the mohawk river and bring holt his
dinner after a while she began bring-
ing extra portions of food and asking
darion to join in this manner their
friendship developed

  as they became better acquainted
and her natural shyness wore away
she confessed her brothers weaknesses
to the engineer

  since father died grant has been
drinking and gambling she said
mother and i have begged him to quit
but it doesnt do any good weve been
afraid hed do something-something
desperate one of these days you see
the farm was left to him but he wont
stay on it he says he wants excite-
ment

  on pay days holt would disappear
and not b seen for several days then
he would turn up without a cent at
such times the girl would appeal to
darion after considerable thought the
engineer hit upon a possible solution of
the difficulty on the following pay
day he put it into effect

  when they were going off duty-the
men were paid in currency-darion
sidled up to the fireman and tipped him
a wink

  isnt there a game going on some-
where he asked

  holt looked surprised but noting the
engineers apparent seriousness ad-
mitted that there was a place where
such a thing as gambling might be in-
dulged in

  but i didnt think you gambled he
said later as they left the hotel and
turned east into dominick street

  darion laughed and took hold of
grants arm i dont play as a rule
he answered but sometimes a fellow
needs a little excitement doesnt he

  they walked rapidly through the twi-
light crossed the black river canal and
continued on until the new york cen-
tral tracks were reached here in a
little roombehind a saloon run by a
fellow called flat-eyed pierce darion
was introduced to as ugly a group of
gamesters as he had ever met

  the engineer was introduced around

 bought the usual drinks and later got
 into a poker game that was in progress
 it didnt take him an hour to karn as a
 certainty what he had already sus-
 pected on looking around the dimly
 lighted room he noticed several workers
 on the canal this strengthened his
 suspicions

   for the first few hands he won easily
 -too easily he knew-but did not be-
 tray himself he observed that a cer-
 tain number of strangers played at each
 table with the canal men the frame-
 up was now so plausible that he all but
 laughed aloud

   he watched holts eager flushed face
 at another table darion continued to
 win nearly every hand and an hour
 later quit fifty dollars winner

   after that he walked over and sat
 in at the table where holt was play-
 ing so far the latter had been win-
 ning but now his luck changed darion
 won with a regularity that amazed the
 others holt included the two others
 at the table shuffled uneasily in their
 chairs and exchanged glances

   it came darions turn to deal and he
 grabbed the cards suddenly out of the
 hands of one of the players who was
 fingering the deck suspiciously the
 man glared at him but did not speak

   darion ruffled the deck leisurely then
 flipped out the cards five all around it
 came to the draw and holt asked for
 two cards darion hesitated a moment
 before handing them over

   that was a bad discard you made
 holt he said looking evenly into the
 firemans startled eyes

  what-what do you mean

   i dealt you three kings and two low
 cards didnt i now youve thrown
 away the last two cards and are draw-
 ing for a full house i believe

  holts jaw fell and he seemed
 stricken dtunb

   too bad you did that holt darion
 exclaimed lifting his voice so that it car-
 ried over the room for the next two
 cards you would have drawn are kings
 we seem to have a remarkable deck
 here i grabbed it just in time its not
 the first deck ive run across however
 that had five kings
the barge canal mystery



  every play stopped holts three
kings fluttered face up to the table da-
rion snapped down the other two at
the same time he dropped the pack and
jerked out a revolver

  keep your hands in sight gentle-
men he commanded as the two men at
the table started to make a move im
sorry our little party has to be broken
up so rudely but i got wise to the play
before id dealt the second hand ive
been on canal contracts before and i
know a certain kind of hangers-on that
follow the camps i learned your tricks
some time ago and a lot more you
havent discovered yet by what i
gather the picking has been very easy
and very pleasant i merely wanted the
floor a moment to tell the canal men
and any others who have come here
looking for a square game that youre
up against a heads-i-win tails-you-lose
proposition and the sooner you get wise
to the scheme the better it will be for
your pocketbooks im not strong on
handing out advice but ive been on
both sides of the table in this sort of
game and i know what im talking
about i guess thats all

  before the listeners could collect their
wits and realize what was taking place
darion pushed holt toward the door

  run for it he whispered

  at the same time he slipped his free
hand behind him gripped his chair and
hurled it full against the low-hanging
oil lamp in the middle of the room

  there was a crash of shattered glass
utter darkness and a rumble of cries
and shouts taking advantage of the
confusion darion avoided the door and
stepped out through the nearest open
window a minute later he caught up
with holt

  they were silent until the lighted
streets were reached then holt turned
to the engineer and gripped his hand

  i guess youve taught me my lesson
darion he said ive been a fool
ive been dropping my wages there
every week

  youll keep it next pay day wont
you

  you can just bet i will holt an-
swered then after a pause he con-

tinued i only wish you had come
sooner

  darion caught a new note in the fire-
mans voice

  what do you mean by that holt 

  the other flushed and checked him-
self he did not look the engineer
squarely in the face

  i-i-oh its nothing of impor-
tance he stammered

  that was as much as darion was
able to get out of him that night on
his way back to the stanwix he thought
over the rough experience he had just
passed through and wondered if such a
melodramatic adventure would have
been possible in the quiet city of rome
before the advent of the barge canal
workers and their shady camp follow-
ers

chapter vii

cement and salary

it was darions expectation that he
would be retained on the dredge but
carreau came to him one day and ad-
mitted that he was too valuable a man
for inside work and that he wanted him
out on the job so from that day
darion was an assistant under the head
superintendent and he soon proved to
those he came in contact with that his
advancement was merited

  taking an interest in holt and realiz-
ing that the more the young fellow was
around the better he would act darion
had him taken from the dredge and put
in charge of the ceunent-mixing ma-
chines

  the walls of the first lock were being
constructed and darion watched the
pouring of the concrete with anxious
eyes after a job was once startedt the
state specifications allowed-should the
weather turn cold-the contractor to
use artificial means to prevent the con-
crete from freezing this was accom-
plished by heating both the sand and thfe
water and using a strong salt solution
in the mixture

  darion watched his thermometer
carefully and held up any work where
the instrument registered below twenty
degrees when warmer weather came
the work progressed more rapidly al-


top-notch magazine

though to keep within the bounds of the
contracts no cement could be laid when
the thermometer rose above seventy-five
degrees

  one day darion and and carreau took
the boat and went down the old canal
to a point in the neighborhood of
oriskany where some retaining walls
had been erected nearly six months pre-
vious carreau seemed proud of the
completed job and explained to the en-
gineer the difficulties they had met and
overcome in getting in the foundations
because of the soft shifting soil and
the force of the mohawk river which
for days undermined the temporary
caissons almost as fast as they were put
down

  darion interested in such an under-
taking got out of the boat and inspected
closely the huge sloping walls gleaming
white y in the early sunlight tearing
off some of the boards that were used to
cover the uncompleted end he uttered a
sharp exclamation carreau follow-
ing behind him after tying up the boat
hurried to his side

  whats the matter

  darion pointed to parts of the wall
core showing plainly in the cross sec-
tion

  see that he stuck a knife blade
into the cement it crumbled away al-
most as easily as loose sand how
long do you suppose this wall will stand
when there is any kind of pressure
against it

  carreaus face darkened

  that old superintendent is to blame
for this he muttered he put in the
wall last july when we were having
such hot weather i told him to be care-
ful

  darion continued with his inspection
probing the core up as high as he could
reach and he became more and more
puzzled

  wasnt the fault of the hot weath-
er he said after a while in a decided
way

  then whats your idea carreau
asked

  rotten cement

  impossible carreau shook his
head as if the supposition could not be

entertained for a moment impossible
darion every ounce of this cement
has been tested and o kd by the state
officials

  you mean you believe it has

  i mean nothing of the sort im
positive on that point why man alive
new york spends a small fortune on
these tests cement is the heart of the
barge canal its the making or the
breaking of a hundred-million-dollar
job theyve got to use caution
they havent used much here da-
rion shut his knife and slipped it back to
his pocket ive had experience with

the stuff before in fact i- he

caught himself and paused anyhow
carreau i know bad cement when i
see it that wall looks o k on the
face and itll probably last for a year or
so or until you are clear of the job
youre not insinuating carreau
burst out that im a party to such a
deal are you

  certainly not if the state put its
seals on the cement and said you could
use it why that lets you out of course
meanwhile the wall will stand inspec-
tion until you get your money

  i dont believe the wall is in as bad
shape as you make out carreau sput-
tered youre too confounded criti-
cal

  ive been brought up to believe that
one cannot be too critical on a contract
a mans reputation especially if he is
working toward one end-that is to
gain the top of the ladder-can never be
blackened because he took too many
pains

  carreau looked queerly into the en-
gineers face but did not vouchsafe an
answer they went back to the boat
started the engine and went spinning up
the quiet canal toward the newer work-
ings

  at a temporary dock carreau steered
in and the engineer stepped ashore be-
for they parted darion spoke

  youre leaving me in full charge of
these new locks are you not

  absolute charge yes

  then whatever job i undertake to
do im directly and solely responsible
for the concrete i put in is going to
the barge canal mystery



stand remember that ive taken ex-
traordinary pains to make my word
good

  why of course carreau said puz-
zled for the moment by the direct way
in which the engineer put his declara-
tion of course we cant overlook
anything those locks must stand
the fact is carreau darion went
on i-i think youd better know now
as afterward-i have condemned half
the cement in your storehouse

  you-youve what carreau almost
shouted

  condemned it isnt fit to be used
yet the state seals are on every barrel
ive been making tests myself

  carreaus face was a picture of dis-
tress

  you-you he stammered youre
going too far condemned my cement
have you made your own tests have
you  you seem to be-running my own
job for me who do you think you are

anyway i-i-

  but darion did not wait to hear more
he turned and walked away in the di-
rection of the construction work leav-
ing the foreman incoherent with rage
standing in the boat

  that night when darion returned to
the hotel he met one of the subcontrac-
tors who informed him that carreau
wanted to speak with him at once da-
rion smiled grimly and wtent upstairs

  he found carreau pacing the room
smoking steadily

  well you got here at last did you 
he growled when the engineer entered
the room ive been trying to get you
all afternoon

  sorry carreau but i had more im-
portant things to do

  what ive got to say to you will only
take one second the foreman burst
out only one second he brought
one fist into the open palm of his other
hand youre running roughshod over
me and over my job you seem to be
doing just as you please with my end of
the deal you never seem to think it
necessary to ask whether a thing is sat-
isfactory to me or not do you  youve
got more nerve and independence than
-than--

  i suppose you want me to resign
darion said interrupting him you
neednt make so much fuss over it im
ready to quit

  quit resign carreau gulped
who mentioned such a thing not
me thats the farthest thing from my
mind youre just the kind of an en-
gineer ive been praying for go ahead
on that job and do it up right im
going to raise your salary next month

chapter viii

a matter of buttons

ctollowing that unexpected an-
nouncement of carreau darion
took a firmer hold on the erection of
the new locks the next day a state in-
spector turned up accompanied by car-
reau and the three-darion made him-
self one of the party without waiting to
be invited-visited the storehouse to ex-
amine a new shipment of cement

  the usual routine was gone through
the inspector took a sample from one
barrel in each ten the result was he
filled a fairly good-sized bag darion
watched the operations critically

  carreau called one of the laborers
and had him carry the bag through the
workings to the motor boat here da-
rion watched the two men embark the
sack of cement in the stern of the boat
he stood and gazed after the little craft
until it was lifted through the first lock
and had finally disappeared in the direc-
tion of rome

  he retraced his steps puzzling over
the matter the inspector appeared to
be a calm and conscientious sort of chap
not given to much needless speech and
fully acquainted with his duty car-
reau had made no suggestions as to
what barrels should be sampled in fact
as far as darion could make out very
few words had passed between them
besides the states practice was to send
a different inspector each time this
was to prevent collusion

  with this fact in mind darion be-
fore the day was over obtained at least
a dozen samples from the different bar-
rels and tested them for his own satis-
faction


top-notch magazine

  at the end of three days his suspi-
cions bore fruit the cement proved to
be of an extremely poor quality totally
unfit for such exacting work as lock
walls yet carreau turned in a report
from the official inspector in which this
latter passed all the cement in the store-
house certifying that it was of superior
quality and fit to be used in the con-
struction work

  the situation was puzzling there
was yet some little cog in the machine
which darion had to discover he felt
certain that the inspector was not at
fault he knew too that the cement
testing laboratory at albany so well
equipped and carefully conducted by a
corps of earnest operators was return-
ing a correct report on the material sent
them

  the conclusion was inevitable then
that the bad cement did not reach al-
bany  the kind the testing laboratory
reported on was not the kind that was
being used for the barge canil work

  darion knew that no crooked deal
could be perfect that somewhere some-
how the unexpected would happen and
the mechanism be uncovered that there
was always a loophole and it was only a
question of time when some sharp eye
would discover it

  on the last of the month darion
walked up the towpath of the old canal
trying to estimate roughly the amount
of lumber needed to build a temporary
path through this section the erie
canal was to be widened yet the work
had to be carried forward without hin-
drance to the daily traffic provision
had to be made for a towpath that could
be utilized until the new canal should be
in readiness the new waterway was
to be given over entirely to power boats
therefore the towpath would be done
away with

  darion walked slowly up the path
nodding to the men on the packets who
spoke to him and exchanging an occa-
sional word with the rough and pic-
turesque drivers

  arriving at the lock he crossed over
and spoke to the old keeper known the
country around as silent john this
lock tender was a quaint sympathetic

old type and had been in charge at this
particular lock for nearly fifty years

  his hair was pure white and it hung
matted about his stooped shoulders he
never wore a hat his clothes were
faded and green with age and seemed
ready to fall apart at a touch his
beard was a trifle darker than his hair
and it hung well down to the middle of
his chest

  his eyes-a peculiar shade of blue-
were the most interesting thing about
him-eyes that were for the most part
expressionless giving one the impres-
sion of belonging to a small wondering
child

  silent john when off duty could be
found wandering over the country
sometimes willing to stop and talk other
times silent of late darion had no-
ticed him about the new workings his
trig staring eyes fastened blankfy upon
the horde of laborers or else watching
the dredges

  it was said that silent john had once
had a small fortune but speculated and
lost it it was said too that he was
partly insane but for all of that never
an accident had happened at his lock
and the state was contented to keep him
in its employ

  hello john darion called out to
him crossing over on the narrow bridge
from the bank to the island where
the tiny house was built between the two
locks not your busy day i see

  johns big eyes roved and rested upon
the engineer not a trace of expression
showed within their depths he took
his pipe from between his lips

  only three boats to-day he said
only three he shook his head slow-
ly time was when thirty went down
in a forenoon that was ten years
ago

  well just wait until we get the new
canal through darion said enthusiasti-
cally then youll see fifteen-hundred-
ton boats going through

  i dont want to see em john re-
turned

  darion sat on the bench running the
length of the house and filled his pipe
borrowing a match from the tender a
long white boat appeared and john
the barge canal mystery



                                                                    hi

let it through the lock as it moved
past a man came from the cabin and
tossed out an object it fell at darions
feet he picked it up but silent john
jerked it from his fingers

  its mine the old man muttered
its my button

  i saw it was a button the engineer
said whats it for

  the toll theyre payin me toll
all of em do it aint you seen my
buttons

  buttons  a look into the old mans
eyes kept darion from smiling

  yes  silent john went on his eyes
widened as a childs might be at the
sight of a desired toy ive got some
beautiful buttons theyre all mine
still wondering the engineer followed
the old man into the house here on a
long table darion saw a remarkable col-
lection of buttons they were of every
size and description-pearl brass cloth
bone there were cheap ones of tin
evidently from some laborers clothes
and beside them others-wondrous crea-
tions that must have come from a wom-
ans ball gown they were all there
spread out upon the table mute wit-
nesses to the old mans childish hobby
silent john sank down beside his treas-
ures and let his trembling brown fin-
gers caress them one by one

  theyre all mine he whispered over
and over to himself theyre all-i
got-left-now he smiled to him-
self sometimes i get talkin with
them and they tell me strange things-
strange things

  darion felt a lump creep into his
throat and he turned sharply away to
look out of the window he realized
that through all these years the rough
men on the passing canal boats had hu-
mored the old lock keeper by giving him
buttons for toll and how such a little
act must have cheered his narrow
dreary life

  in the interval that followed while
john still bent over his buttons darion
swept his gaze about the little room it
was the typical lock keepers shack-a
few highly colored pictures on the dirty
walls advertisements mostly nonde-
script articles on the floor and shelves

an old stove which served both the uses
of cooking and heating a bunk was
drawn up against the farther wall
framed on the door hung the rules and
regulations of the erie canal

  suddenly darions eye caught a pile
of bags half covered by a strip of can-
vas a curious thought leaped to his
mind for the moment he studied over
the situation pieced it out bit by bit as
one might knot together lengths of
tring he turned to the lock keeper
what are the bags here for john
the old man let his eyes wander
slowly to where darions finger pointed

  carreau-brings them he an-
swered apparently reluctant to leave his
hobby

  what for

  i-dont know

  what do you do with them

  i put them in his boat

  darion reflected for a moment

  but why do you do it he spoke
slowly and plainly as he might have ad-
dressed a child

  john appeared to be thinking ap-
parently he had to study out every word
before the meaning dawned upon his
sluggish brain

  i-i- he began-and then his

eyes brightening he went on because
carreau-gives me such beautiful but-
tons oh you dont know how pretty
they are

  darion felt a torrent of questions leap
to his lips his pulses raced as if under
a stimulant yet he calmed himself and
proceeded to cross-examine his man
with the utmost patience he realized
that at any moment the lock keeper
might stop and refuse to speak

  sentence by sentence he drew john
on like a school-teacher prompting a
dull pupil the old man answered in
monosyllables darion brought to bear
all his tact and perseverance he was
in fear that a boat might appear and
distract the lock keepers mind

  at the end of an hour darion arose
and passed a quick hand across his
damp face he had learned enough it
had come bit by bit but the facts were
indisputable

  he went outside into the sunlight and


top-notch magazine

drew in his first relieved breath john
followed as the engineer nodded
good-by the lock keeper caught quickly
at his sleeve

  would-would you-give me one of
those buttons he pointed to the pe-
culiarly shaped ones on darions khaki
coat

  without a word the engineer snapped
one free and placed it in his open palm

  oh thank you thank you old john
murmured it-is so-pretty-so very
pretty

  and darion left him still murmuring
his obligations

chapter ix

where hammond laughs

the late afternoon train from albany

	brought into rome carreau and
hammond the foreman had run down
to the capitol in answer to an urgent
telegram from the lawyer now that
the little matter was fixed in an agree-
able way both men were returning to
the stanwix hotel this was ham-
monds first meeting with carreau since
the day of darions employment

  as the train whirled through the out-
skirts of rome and past some of the
contract operations the lawyer spoke

  you are still employing that engi-
neer-darion  he asked

  carreau nodded hes still on the
job and let me tell you hammond
the mans a wonder hes saved me ten
thousand dollars on this contract

  evidently you did not think my
warning amounted to much did you
hammond said

  carreau shrugged his shoulders da-
rion may act a bit unusual at times but
so far ive found him frank-extremely
so in fact hammond he spotted that
job on the wall before i had time to
open my mouth he seems to know ce-
ment when he sees it

  hammonds black eyes narrowed and
he fumbled with his cigar hes going
to get you into trouble carreau mark
my words you are so stubborn now
you wont take a little warning but
youll regret the whole job when the
time comes

  maybe so  carreau looked puz-
zled he runs roughshod over me all
the time i dont know why i allow him
to do it but hang it all jap ive got
sort of a sneaking regard for him
when you meet a clean straightforward
sort of chap with ambitions and ideals it
-well it makes a man regret some
things

  doing the crawfish act are you car-
reau  hammond snapped angrily
after i get matters well oiled and
things running smoothly you begin to

act like-

  i give you credit for the whole
scheme jap carreau broke in
youve got a great head on those shoul-
ders but for all you can say that en-
gineer sticks with me and the jdb
youd let him walk all over you eh
dictate to you would you youre a
smart contractor you are

  lets drop the subject

  i want an understanding ham-
mond  protested you cannot work
this game from both sides

  the train stopped before the con-
tractor had time to answer if such was
his intention and both men climbed out
of the smoker to the station platform

  suppose we take a run out to the
work carreau suggested the mot-
to r boat is tied up at the dock above
here id like to see whats been hap-
pening to-day

  hammond hesitated a moment im
not keen to meet your engineer he said
presently but id like to see what
hes been doing

  you wont need to meet him the
contractor said only i cant see why
youre so devilish afraid of running
across him he wont bite

  oh im not afraid of his bite
hammond gave back with an attempt
at laughing but there was something
in the sound that did not ring true and
carreau was more puzzled than ever

  however he did not question the
lawyer further and in five minutes they
were speeding up the canal in total dis-
regard of its traffic regulations

  darion ought to have most of the
lock walls in by this time carreau said
as they passed through silent johns
the barge canal mystery



lock he was to start on the lower
ones this morning

  hammond sneered probably know-
ing you were in albany hes been loaf-
ing

  not that engineer carreau an-
swered confidently id stake him
against a thousand

  a twist of the canal brought them
within sight and sound of the big job
the drills were barking and sputtering
on the higher levels the dinkies
each pushing a string of dump cars
loaded with the waste rock snorted back
and forth across the temporary tracks
swarms of men were running here and
there over the towering falsework of the
big dams  wagons with fresh earth were
rumbling in single file along plank roads
their red-shirted drivers the one splotch
of color in the picture

  carreau steered his boat carefully
past a line of moored construction
flats and finally nosed it in at the
usual docking place when he stepped
out and swept his eyes toward the spot
where the concrete work was supposed
to be in progress he came to a sudden
halt a questioning exclamation on his
lips

  whats the trouble  hammond
asked walking beside him

  why-why-the concrete work
the contractor said its stopped 
hammond broke into a laugh by
george this is good expected to find
your job completed and it isnt even
commenced your fine engineer prob-
ably got tired and has gone off fishing
carreau seemed at a loss for speech
he rubbed his eyes as if doubting what
they showed him the mixing ma-
chines were there a dozen of them but
not a wheel was moving rows of
wheelbarrows high on the narrow
planking loaded with sand and gravel
were at rest the falsework about the
lock was deserted it looked as if in
the midst of the operations that some
mysterious power had suddenly spirited
away every human being from the con-
crete work

  hammond was still laughing hugely
enjoying the fact that his previous in-
sinuations had become realities

  a solitary figure came walking to-
ward them carreau recognizing a
subforeman called to him

  what does this mean carreau
asked

  what does what mean mr car-
reau asked the other apparently puz-
zled by the contractors manner and
speech

  why-this-this idleness  this
leaving off the work what has hap-
pened

  we worked an hour on the cement
this morning the man explained
then your engineer darion told us to
quit

  carreaus face turned as near purple
as it was possible for it to become

  told-told you to quit he cried
to quit wasted all day-when every
hour has got to count 

  those were ovir orders hes put
most of the men on the excavation
work

  where is darion

  i think hes getting the new dredge
in position

  go and tell him that i want to see
him-at once understand 

  will you wait here

  no carreau whirled on his heel
and went toward the moored boat i
shall be at the hotel

chapter x

darion has the floor

nine oclock that night darion
came in from the job moving the
new dredge had taken a longer time
than he- first thought and he did not
wish to leave until things were in proper
shape the clerk at the desk repeated
what the subforeman had told him fully
three hours ago-that mr carreau
wished to see him at once

  he is in his room and wants you to
come up immediately were the clerks
words

  darion did not answer he took his
key went to his own room on the floor
above carreaus took a bath and had
dinner it was ten oclock when he
knocked at carreaus door the large
room-it was a parlor of the suite-was


top-notch magazine

in darkness save for a single shaded
globe which hung down over a map-
littered table

  darions entrance apparently was un-
expected just then for both men-
hammond was at the table with the
contractor-stood erect darion bowed
slightly to carreau

 hello jap hammond darion
called out youre quite a stranger
carreau consumed as he was with
anger against darion did not overlook
the significance of this in a flash he
saw it as an evidence that darion and
hammond had not only met before but
that the young engineer knew the law-
yer by his none too savory nickname
a silence fell between the three men
fof the moment intuitively each felt
that a crisis was at hand

  of the three darion was the calmest
i believe you wanted to see me car-
reau he said

  the contractor wet his lips we-
we were down on the job this after-
noon carreau was fast gaining con-
trol over his words you were not
there the concrete machines were idle
not a wheel was turning

  i ordered everything stopped at ten
oclock darion replied rolling the still-
lighted cigar between his fingers

  what right had you to give such an
order carreau demanded what
right  you knew we had to get that ce-
ment laid this week yet you deliber-
ately order the men off the job

  you ask me what right i had car-
reau  the engineer advanced a step
toward the circle of light you placed
me in full charge of the work did you
not

  yes yes  cried carreau flinging up
his hands wildly but you had no
right to stop that cement wrork

  mr carreau darion said sharply
the other day i told you that what-
ever job i undertook i would be solely
and directly responsible for remem-
ber that i told you also that the con-
crete i put in even if it was only for a
flight of stairs had to stand

  whats that got to do with it
  everything at ten oclock this

morning i used up the last of the ce-
ment

  last of it carreau frowned
why the storehouse is full

   i should have said then that i used
up the last of the good cement darion
answered as long as i am on this job
that stufif in the storehouse you call ce-
ment will stay there

   hammond who to this point had re-
mained an attentive though passive lis-
tener now cleared his throat bent over
and whispered into the contractors ear
then he picked up his hat and started
for the door

   darion blocked his way

   youd better stay in the room ham-
mond he said calmly

  hammond hesitated for a moment
his eyes questioning i dont think this
matter concerns me

  no then youve another think
coming jap im not through yet
you will find a lot to interest you in
some remarks i have to make

   i am not accustomed to being or-
dered hammond broke out angrilyi
prefer not to remain your actions and
insinuations are distasteful

  really darion allowed a faint
smile to curve his lips it must be an-
noying indeed but you will have to
grin and bear it to-night please go
back and sit down

  hammond clenched his fingers and
half raised his arms-only to be met
with darions cool amused smile
youd better sit down

  hammond returned to the chair he
had just left dropped his hat on the ta-
ble-and waited



chapter xi

a word from darion

it was carreau who spoke next he
wondered what could be the mean-
ing of the scene between the engineer
and hammond but beyond a puzzled
look did not betray his interest

  about that cement darion he
broke in uneasily quite aware that
there was an undercurrent he could not
fathom every barrel of it has been
passed by the state inspector
the barge canal mystery



  darion shook his head and smiled
the state inspector never took a grain
of that cement to the laboratory at al-
bany you know that carreau and jap
hammond knows it too

  dont bring me into this hammond
snarled

  my my darion said now thor-
oughly enjoying the situation tense
though it was what a good boy little
jap is all at once why hammond ive
been seeing your handiwork all through
the game i couldnt mistake it youre
a pretty clever man and your little
schemes generally glide along without
friction i say generally but some-
times a cog slips

  i hope you know wthat youre talk-
ing about hammond- snapped out

  i think i was talking about the un-
expected thing the engineer returned
now but for the fact that a certain
old and harmless lock keeper had a

mania for collecting buttons-

  darion was interrupted here by angry
exclamations from the others appar-
ently it was an unconscious move da-
rions remarks had struck the nerve

  ah i thought that would interest
you he said i think neither of you
gentlemen will have serious trouble in
understanding me now

  see here darion carreau put in
youre making a gallery play arent
you this lock keeper and his buttons
have no connection with your failure to
lay that cement

  theres where youre wrong car-
reau you know youre wrong oh
come out of your shells gentlemen
dont you begin to suspect that i am not
entirely a fool  this isnt the first
proposition of the kind ive bucked up
against your friend jap can vouch for
that why down in panama hammond
and i were interested along the same
lines werent we hammond winced
but did not answer

  im sorry to find you the goat car-
reau darion went on ive grown to
have a friendly feeling toward you
you handed me a job on a silver plat-
ter figuratively speaking and im in-
debted to you before that because

jap got me in bad down at panama i
had a hard time landing

  now the question arises are we to
stick together it depends upon you
carreau prompted by hammond
youve lured that poor old lock keeper
into changing cement bags at his lock
you probably take the inspector into the
shack and give him a drink while silent
john does the trick and hes a profit-
able man to deal with john is taking
his pay in buttons having the state
o k on all the cement youve gone
ahead and built your retaining walls and
your dams and your locks knowing the
blame will never fall upon your shoul-
ders your conscience-well it has
been taking a vacation

  hammond was livid with rage the
castles he had cunningly erected were
toppling about his shoulders

  i told you carreau he jerked out
i told you how it would end this
smart engineer of yours has played

spotter and-

  a year ago down at panama you
worked the same game didnt you
hammond darion interposed his
voice hardening you were getting by
writh the trick until i showed you up
you wont deny that but at that time
you had influence somehow and be-
cause of it i found myself out of a job
--and my name blackened every place
i hunted work they seemed to know of
that panama deal-you took particular
pains to spread it well didnt you 
im not through with you yet
hammond raved incoherently youve
bucked me one too many times and im
going to get you

  i think its going to be me wholl
get you hammond darion retorted
gravely

  oh thats a threat is it said
hammond glad youve made it in the
presence of a witness

  take it any way you please re-
turned darion only from now on you
go in your own little path and ill go in
mine youre too crooked for even
crooks to associate with youre too
big a coward to work alone you like
to hide behind anothers back just so
you get your fingers into the pie you

are satisfied if trouble comes you drop
from sight and the other man gets it

an

  you-you cant bring a single wit-
ness against me hammond gave back
not one my word will hold against
yours in any court

  yes i suppose it would darions
lips tightened thats a move you al-
ways prepare for thats your law-
yers instinct silent john would be
judged feeble-minded in court and car-
reau wouldnt dare to open his month
because it - would incriminate him
youve laid your wires with great care
jap

  the first smile came to hammonds
pasty features well what are you
going to do about it

  do  the engineer walked over and
stood before him im going to watch
until i get something on you your
game here on the barge canal is done
the curtains down and its -the last
act youll get out before youre thrown
out

  youd go that far would you

  i used to buck a poker game down
at panama and the sky was my limit
darion replied

  you mean that unless i leave here
youll find some method-fair or unfair
-to make me eh hammond was
struggling for a defense he was ar-
guing his own case as cunningly as he
might have argued one for a client
youve threatened me once before to-
night youre not so interested in my
business affairs as you are in my per-
sonal ones are you your actions and
speech prove that youre out for re-
venge

  i have greater motives than per-
sonal ones hammond darion said
answering him as calmly as he could
but you better than any one else know
that there would be a strong motive for
revenge down in panama where i
was struggling to make a name for my-
self you accused and apparently proved
that i was a cheat-that i was incom-
petent i could not clear myself at the
time that stigma caused me to be
shunned by every contractor to whom i
applied for a position i am still un-

der that shadow my own father be-
lieves it and my former friends ignore
me you played the little cement trick
on me and before i was aware of it
my lock walls crumbled like so much
sand o you wonder that i am after
you 

  order this fellow from the room
carreau hammond shouted i re-
fuse to listen to such-

  just a moment darion broke in
carreau doesnt need to order me out
ill go but before i leave let me tell
you something

  another threat i suppose said
hammond

  call it that if you wish darion re-
sumed calmly in order to have that
dredge working in a satisfactory way
i must continue on the job for a fewr
more days he was addressing car-
reau now the contractor by neither
look nor gesture appeared to be aware
of the fact after that i will resign
i regret it carreau because i am be-
ginning to take a deep interest in my
wrork but i cant allow myself to be
mixed up in shady transactions

  he turned back to the lawyer
hammond i can have a state in-
spector at the storehouse in less than
three hours from the time i send a mes-
sage to albany five hundred barrels
of rotten cement are liable to create a
zephyr of excitement i shouldnt won-
der if it made rome howl and i dont
think any pent-up utica will contract
that towns powers to yell nor is it
likely to make gay lyons pour pepper-
mint oil upon the canals troubled wa-
ters it will not bring sugar from the
salt wells of syracuse rochester and
other cities along our great inland wa-
terway may be depended upon to sit up
and take notice but nothing unpleas-
ant will happen of course if you two
play fair with the state of new york

we invite

every thin man and woman

  this is an invitation that no thin man
or woman can afford to ignore we in-
vite you to try a new treatment called
sargol that helps digest the food you
eat-that puts good solid flesh on people
that are thin and under weight

  how can sargol do this we will
tell you this new treatment is a scien-
tific assimilative agent it increases cell
growth the very substance of which our
bodies are made-puts red corpuscles in
the blood which every thin person so
sadly needs strengthens the nerves and
puts the digestive tract in such shape
that every ounce of food gives out its
full amount of nourishment to the blood
instead of passing through the system
undigested and unassimilated

  women who never appear stylish in
anything they wear because of their
thinness men under weight or lacking in
nerve force or energy have been made to
enjoy the pleasures of life-been fitted
to fight lifes battles as never for years
through the use of sargol

  if you want a beautiful and well-
rounded figure of which you can be
justly proud-a body full of throbbing
life and energy write the sargol com-
pany -n herald bldg binghamton

solutely free and use with every meal

mrs a i rodenheiser writes

weighed about  pounds when i began using it and now i weigh
 pounds so really this makes twenty-four pounds i feel
stronger and am looking better than ever before and now i carry
rosy cheeks which is something j could never say before

clay johnson says

  please send me another ten-day treatment i am well
pleased with sargol it has been the light of my life  am get-
tinsback to my proper weight again when i began to take
sargol i only weighed  pounds and now four weeks later 
am weighing  pounds and feeling- fine

f gagnon writes

  here is my report since taking the sargol treatment i am
a man  years of age and was all run down to the very bottom
i had to quit work as i whs so weak now thanks to sargol i
look like a new man i gained  pounds with  daystreat-
ment  cannot tell you how happy t feel
