 flute

 harp

 cornet

 cello

 guitar

you know how easy it is to
put letters together and
form words once you have
learned the alphabet playing a
musical instrument is not very
much different once you learn
the notes playing melodies on the
mandolin piano or violin is simply
a matter of putting the notes to-
gether correctly

  the first note shown above is f
whether you are singing from
notes playing the	i

piano or banjo or
any other musical in-
strument that note
in the first space is
always f the four
notes indicated are f

a c e easy to re-
member because they
spell the word face

certain strings on the
mandolin certain
keys on the piano
represent these same
notes-and once you
learn them playing
melodies on the instrument is
largely a matter of following the
notes

  anyone can now learn to play
a musical instrument at home
without a teacher a new simpli-
fied method of teaching reduces
all music to its simplest possible
form you can now master sing-
ing piano-plaving or any musical
instrument you wish right at
home quickly easily without end-
less study and practice

  practice is essential of course-
but its fun the new way youll
begin to play melodies almost
from the start the  print-and-
picture  method of self-teaching
is fascinating its simply a matter
of following one interesting step

 drums and
 t raps
 harmony and
 composition
 sight singing
 ukulele
 piccolo
 t rombono
 saxophone
 hawaiian steel guitar
 automatic finger control
 voice and speech culture

after another you learn that the
note in the first space is f and
that a certain key on the piano is
f thereafter you will always
be able to read f and play it
whenever you see it just as you
are able to recognize the letters
that make a word you will be able
to recognize and play the notes
that make a melody its easy
interesting

  you dont have to know any-
thing whatever about
music to learn to
play a musical in-
strument this new
way you dont
have to pin yourself
down to regular
hours to regular

vol cxlvii	saturday november  	nimber  j

by robert orr chipperfield

chapter i

     with the light of morning

the great inner square court of mrs
samuel cayleys new country house
at sunny beach was flooded with the
dazzling bright light of early moming it
glinted not only down through the lofty
glass-domed roof but in from the whole
north side thrown open to the glistening
sandy shore with the dancing blue waters
just beyond in conformity with the span-
ish style the rooms were built in two stories
with a gallery running around the three in-
closed sides and as carp the butler came
down the staircase his faded eyes blinked
in the glare and he shook his head disap-
provingly

    	a

  these newfangled copies of foreign archi-
tecture were not to his liking he was sure
he should never get used to this huge bare-
sanded court with its fountain and the ugly
stone seats scattered about instead of a
spacious veranda outside where a body
could serve tea and iced drinks after the
old-established custom of his two genera-
tions with the best families

  moreover something was wrong carp
paused at the foot of the staircase uncertain
what it was which seemed out of place
then as his eyes became accustomed to the
light he saw that the great center double
door of glass across the patio opening on
the still unfinished concrete terrace stood
widely ajar

  directly facing it with its massive carved


argosy-allstory weekly

 back to him was the stone bench upon
 which he had left mr benkard seated on
 the previous evening when the latter an-
 nounced that he himself would lock up he
 had evidently forgotten to do so but it
 would never do to have him come down and
 be reminded of it by finding now that the
 house had been left open on the shoreward
 side all night

  carp hurried across the sanded stone
 floor skirting the fountain and the end of
 that wide-armed marble bench then he
 stopped all at once and a shrill high-pitched
 scream tore its way from his throat

   henry carp have you gone crazy a
 sharp-featured housemaid of indeterminable
 age appeared hurriedly at the head of the
 stairs adjusting her apron as she came

  do you want to wake up the house yelling
 like that what is it

   but carp could only wave to her inar-
 ticulately he was grimacing in a horrible
 fashion and seemed to be staring down at
 something at his feet something which was
 concealed from her by the high back of the
 seat she hurried down and across to him
 then stifled the cry which rose to her own
 lips lying face downward at their feet
 was the body of a man in dinner clothes
 with the whole back of his head a shapeless
 spongy congealed mass and the white sand
 all about it stained a hideous reddish-
 brown

    it isnt-it cant be mr benkard
  her lips barely formed the superfluous
  question but the old man nodded gripping
  her wiry arm for support

    who else he was the only gentleman
  in the house after mr lane started back to
  the city and i left him here smoking when
  mrs cayley and the young ladies had gone
  to bed i left him here smoking on that
  very seat

    carps voice had risen in a cracking fal-
  setto

    letty what could ha happened
  letitia opened her lips to speak but
  paused as though realizing the futility of
  the suggestion she was about to offer at
  that moment a cheerful if somewhat mo-
  notonously whistled refrain sounded from
  outside and a tall lanky workman in over-
  alls crossed the terrace toward the pile of

concrete blocks just beyond the open glass

 doors

 leave go my arm letitia exclaimed

  geoff geoff come here will you

   the workman turned revealing a long
lantern-jawed face with mild ruminative
brown ej-es and a shock of sandy hair be-
neath his cap

    whats up he asked in a slow nasal
 drawl as he pushed the doors open and en-
 tered then at sight of the body he halted

  land o liberty

    its mrs cayleys brother mr joseph
 benkard replied letitia  you know
 him dont you

    i know him all right

   the man called  geoff  w as still staring
 down at the body

    i wouldnt swear that was him though
 unless i seen his face

    i left him here smoking last night and
 he said hed finish locking up carp re-
 peated the only fact which his stunned mind
 seemed still able to grasp id already
 tended to the ground floor windows and big
 front entrance door over there on the other
 side of the house

    the ladies had all gone to their rooms
 and there wasnt anybody else on the place
 but letty and the cook and me he was
 right there on that bench lounging careless-
 like and the terrace doors were standing
 half open just the way you found them
 when you came in a minute ago he-he
 couldnt have fell over backward and hit his
 head on something and then fell forward
 again-

    henry carp stop talkin like an old
fool  letty seized his arm in her turn and
gave it a little shake  theres been a-an
accident or somethin what do you think
geoff

    hes dead anyways the individual ap-
 pealed to responded laconically  better
 let the folks know and mebbe doc hood
 taint my business got to get back to my
 work

   he turned as though to go out on the ter-
 race once more but at the word  dead 
 carp had reeled and would have fallen if
 letty had not caught him

  geoff peters i spose youd be raixin
 concrete if the skies fell she exclaimed
above suspicion



witheringly  help me to ease him down
on the bench-

   seems to me i wouldnt do that if i was
you

  geoffs mild eyes glanced once more spec-
ulatively at the prostrate motionless figure
as he relieved her of the old butlers limp
weight

   course taint my business but if you
ask me seems to me id stay away from
that bench and everything round it and
keep other folks away too till the doc gits
here kinder think id put henry on that
stone seat over there instead

  why lettys sharp tones were
hushed as she helped to lead carps totter-
ing steps in the direction indicated

   footprints the workman spoke in
as matter-of-fact a manner as though he
were discussing a detail in masonry  doc
hoods medcal examiner-used to be
called  coroner  when sunny beach was
just millers cove and outside the city lim-
its-and hes mighty particlar about foot-
prints in this kind of a accident

    this kind  letty repeated horror-
stricken and for once in her capable ex-
istence she was at a loss  howll i keep
mrs cayley and the rest from crowdin
round soons i wake em and tell em that-
that somethins happened to mr benkard
 you go git me a piece o rope geoff
suggested  theres some out by the con-
crete mixer

  when she had flown out to the terrace
geoff strolled at a discreet distance about
the bench and the body lying before it and
then his glance roved around the patio but
every marble seat and flower urn was in
its place with no trace in the sand to indi-
cate that any of them had been disturbed
the circular fountain bed still awaiting the
statue which was to crown it was dry and
empty and through the center of the glass
dome overhead the slender flagpole could be
discerned the gilded eagle at its top gleam-
ing in the sun

  geoff shook his head slowly and his gaze
traveled up the marble staircase and around
the stucco balcony with its ornamental rail-
ing and posts here and there each sur-
mounted by a ball which he himself had
helped to set mushroomlike in the mortar

  behind the closed doors on that balcony
lay the members of the household as yet
unaware of the tragedy which had overtak-
en them in the night and the observer
shrugged  he was glad it wasnt up to him to
enlighten them a passel of hysterical city
women he prided himself on minding his
own affairs did geoffrey peters he was
there to complete the concrete and stucco
terrace and he didnt aim to get mixed up in
any to-do about what had happened to
joseph benkard

   this is all i could find letty reap-
peared from the terrace  we might take
some of that riggin that runs down from
the dome and fastens under the balcony
sos the flag can be histed and lowered
from inside but there isnt any ladder round
long enough-

   wre can make out with this

  geoff took from her the coil of plaster-
smeared rope and tying one end of it to a
hinge of the glass door he passed it around
several of the urns and stone seats and back
to the other side of the half-opened door
once more so that it formed a rude semi-
circle several feet distant from about the
bench there he fastened it and then
ducked beneath it and paused on the thresh-
old

   better tell your folks to keep outside o
that till the doc comes im goin to work
mis cayley can find me on the job if she
needs me

  he slouched out on the terrace and dis-
appeared and letty after one hopeless
glance at carps limp figure turned and
flew up the stairs

  mrs cayley she knocked with a
sharp insistence at one of the doors leading
on to the gallery again she knocked
u oh mrs cayley maam

  there was a sound of movement within
and a portly figure in negligee with graying
hair in a disheveled but permanently waved
coiffure opened the door

   why have you disturbed me letty
she demanded in cold displeasure
l havent i told you-

   oh maam  letty wrung her angu-
lar hands  something terrble has hap-
pened it must have been some time durin
the night for henry carp only found him


argosy-allstory weekly

 just now and when he called out i ran
 down and then geoff peters came-

    what are you talking about mrs
 cayleys contralto tones had lowered tense-
 ly and she gripped the housemaids wrist
 as in a vise while another door farther along
 the gallery opened slightly  what has
 happened and who have you found

    mr benkard maam hes lyin down
 there dead in the court withthe back of his
 head all crushed in-

  dead joseph-dead mrs cayley
 started back repeating the hoarse whisper
 over and over while both hands flew to her
 carefully massaged throat and she stared
 straight before her as though unconscious of
 the presence of her informant  joseph
  yes maam he-he looks as though
 hed been layin there all night and geoff
 peters says nobody must go near-

   her words were choked back for mrs
 cayley had suddenly thrust her aside with
 an imperious sweep of her arm and started
 for the stairs a tall young woman in a
 loose robe with great ropes of red-brown
 hair hanging over each shoulder intercepted
 her

    mrs cayley i could not avoid hearing
 that something was wrong if i can help
 you if i can be of any assistance-

    vera my dear  the stem lines of re-
 pression softened for a moment in the older
 womans face and she steadied herself with
 a hand on the railing  it is my brother
 i do not understand but i fear that some
 accident or illness has come to him and i
 am going down to find out for myself stay
 with mildred and dont let her see or know
 anything if you can help it above all do
 not allow her to come downstairs

    you dont mean- the girls rich
 voice faltered  has-has something ter-
 rible happened oh dont you want me to
 go down with you mr benkard isnt-
  the servants have just found him
 letty exaggerates of course but i gather
 that he is lying unconscious out on the ter-
 race somewhere he may have been there for
 hours mildred is so excitable that i want
 the child kept out of the way until her
 uncle has been cared for

   it is-as bad as that  the young wo-
 mans soft brown eyes closed for a mo-

 ment and her face whitened while a pulse
 beat suddenly in the slim ivory column of
 her throat then her eyes opened full upon
 her hostess and she replied in low steady
 tones  i will take care of mildred of
 course mrs cayley but if there is anything
 further that i can do-if you need me in
 any way-please send for me

    i will my dear

  the gaze of both women turned down-
ward into the patio but from where they
stood they could see only the figure of the
old butler huddled in his seat and the roped-
off semicircle about the terrace doors

  then mrs cayley moved forward to the
staircase while the girl stood quite still for
a moment where she had left her the
folds of the loose robe which she wore re-
vealed rather than concealed the splendid
sweeping lines of her form she would have
appeared like a statue had it not been for
the rapid rise and fall of her breast

   all at once a girlish voice made shrill by
apprehension sounded down the gallery

   letty what is it why do you look
so strange and why has mother gone down-
stairs like that

    please miss sherwood will you tell
miss mildred the housemaid paused to
whisper hurriedly  henry carp isnt goin
to be a mite of use and mrs cayley  need
me will you tell miss mildred that-that
her uncle died sudden in the night

  her uncle-died vera sherwood
repeated almost mechanically  this is
horrible letty are you sure he was
perfectly well last evening how-how
could he have died

  im sure enough miss i saw him
letty responded with grim emphasis  im
sorry to have to break it so quick to mrs
cayley and-and to you miss but mr
benkards been dead for hours from a-an
accident it looks like to the back of his
head i-id better go to mrs cayley
she followed her mistress down the stairs
and vera sherwood turned slowly back
along the gallery to the open door on the
threshold of which stood a younger girl a
dainty fairylike little creature whose
bobbed ash-blond hair curled in soft ring-
lets like a babys about her head and whose
deep violet eyes were wide with alarm
above suspicion



   oh vera what is the matter she
cried  letty looks as though she had seen
a ghost and mother never in the world
would appear like that before any one in
the morning unless there was some fright-
fully important reason for her to leave her
room why didnt she call me and what
was letty saying to you just now

   we didnt think you were awake
vera sought to draw the younger girl back
 come into your room dear-

   i wont be treated like a child mil-
dred wrenched herself free  i dont mean
to be rude but there is something you are
keeping from me and i must know if
you wont tell me i am going straight
downstairs 	

   then you will displease your mother
and- vera paused biting her lips then
went on determinedly  and your uncle
very much come and i will tell you the
little  know myself of what has happened
we cannot talk out here

   your hands are like ice and your voice
-your voice doesnt seem like you at all
somehow 

  the other girl began to sob hysterically
but she retreated into her room permitting
her companion to follow and close the door
tell me

  my dear you must try to control your-
self it is about your uncle he has been
taken suddenly ill carp is with him and
he sent letty upstairs for your mother who
asked me to wait here and keep you with
me vera looked away but she gave the
explanation in a steady quiet tone  per-
haps wre had better dress though for your
uncle may grow worse and wre will have to
receive people the doctor or possibly some
of your uncles business associates from
town

  she moved to the dressing table and com-
menced to unbraid her heavy shining hair
with fingers that shook suddenly

   uncle joe ill  mildreds sobs had
ceased and she stared in amazement but
there was a singular absence of solicitude
in her voice  why he cant be vera
hes never known a days illness in his
life

   it is a touch of the sun from yester-
day probably for letty said something

about your uncles head vera replied
without turning  come and dress
millie

  meanwhile mrs cayley had crossed the
patio to the dividing rope and stood for a
moment motionless looking beyond it to
that which lay in front of the bench an
odd choking sound came from her throat
and she made a gesture as though to stftrt
forward but restrained herself and re-
mained there tense and quivering in every
nerve until letty came up to her and all
but cried out at sight of her face

  oh maam dont look like that i
told you-i told you what had happened
just you let me know what you want done
and ill do it henry carps gone all to
pieces but you know i-i can keep my
head and geoff peters is right outside on
the terrace

  was there a covert warning as well as
personal assurance in the housemaids
speech mrs cayley gave no visible sign
of recognizing either but she asked in a
hushed though peremptory tone

   what has been done

   nothin but to put this rope up here
geoff did that he said nobody ought to go
any wheres near and track up the sand on
the floor until-until the doctor was got
he said that in-in trouble like this the
doctor would take charge of things

   call the man in

  mrs cayley gave one last shuddering
glance at her brothers body and then
drawing her negligee more firmly about her
throat she turned to wrhere the butler was
striving feebly to gather himself together

   dont try to rise carp you found
mr benkard letty tells me was he like
this are you quite sure that he had al-
ready passed away

  habit was strong in the old servant and
he made one more final effort to get upon
his feet before sinking back inertly in the
seat

   i beg pardon madam but i-ive a
gone feeling somehow it was me found
mr benkard as letty says and that not
half an hour ago he was the way you see
him now and there wasnt any need to go
near him

  the quavering voice faltered and then


argosy-allstory weekly

 went on i cant think wliat could have
 happened madam i left him here alone
 smoking and looking out through those open
 doors at the sound all shivery like in the
 moonlight he said i was to go to bed
 that he would lock up later

   for an instant the faded eyes met the
 dry burning ones of his mistress furtively
 and it was almost as though question and
 answer of another sort had passed mutely
 between them for carps shrunken body
 seemed to sag still more and mrs cayley
 turned slightly from him then she re-
 marked

    i cannot think what is keeping letty

 i sent her for the mason geoffrey and she
 said he was just outside on the terrace
 carp are you quite sure that was all mr
 benkard said to you

   she added the last in a low hurried tone
 as if it were forced from her lips and the
 butlers gaze met hers once more this time
 in steady candor

    that was all madam except that i
 was to be sure cook had breakfast for him
 on time this morning he can have had
 no notion that he was going to-to be took
 ill so sudden

   there was time for no more for letty
 appeared at this moment with the taciturn
 geoff in tow

    he was way round in front plasterin
 up a crack in one of the flower urns
 maam she explained  he says if theres
 anythin he can do-

    it was very thoughtful of you to rope
 off this space geoffrey mrs cayley
 spoke with a forced composure which left
 her lips stiffened and white  i appreciate
 your taking the initiative at this sad and
 terrible time

    well maam -geoff turned his cap
 about between his plaster-smeared fingers-
  i aim to mind my own business but i
 kinder thought youd want it done beins
 youre city folks and strange to the ways
 out here when a accident like this happens
  that is why i sent for you just now
 mrs cayley nodded  i suppose there
 are local authorities to be telephoned for in
 the case of-sudden death

   if the workman noted her slight hesita-
 tion he appeared to attach no significance

 to it his stolid mildly ruminative coun-
 tenance did not change an iota in expression
 as he nodded in his turn and drawled

    only doc hood maam you git him
on the wire-main -and tell him how
henry found things when he come down
this momin and hell be here in a jiffy to
take charge hell do whatever there is to
be done is there any ways i can help
you now mis cayley before  git back to
my cement work

    you might assist henry upstairs to his
 room if you will he is quite unfit for
 anything and must rest this dr hood-
 i have heard of him although we have had
 no need of a physicians service since we
 came he is an official as well is he not
 yes maam medcal examiner geoff
 folded his cap and stuffed it into the pocket
 of his overalls  if youll tell me which is
 henrys room-

    letty will go with you and show you
where it is situated

   mrs cayley glanced once more with a
shudder at the roped-in semicircle and then
turned toward one of the doors under the
gallery but paused  the work on the
terrace must be discontinued now of course
but i wish you would stay here geoffrey
at least until i can summon my brothers
secretary from town i may need you
geoff glanced down and shuffled one foot
awkwardly in the sand

    course taint my business but seeins
 you ask me maam i can stick around
 he responded at length not unwillingly
 adding  i got a plenty jobs to do that 
 keep me within call

    i shall appreciate it mrs cayley
turned away once more as letty approached
the butlers huddled figure and remarked
 were goin to get you upstairs now
henry come on geoff he can walk up
between us all right i guess

   but that individual did not immediately
 respond instead he scraped the sand aside
 with a quick dig of his square-toed boot
 disclosing that which his shuffling motion of
 a moment before had covered and picking
 it up thrust it hastily into the pocket with
 his cap

   it was just a scrap of some soft black
 glossy fabric which had lain unnoticed near
above suspicion



one of the urns back of the bench yet it
possessed an interest indeed for geoffrey
peters the stonemason

chapter ii

 how did he die

the bluff hearty voice which replied
to mrs cayley over the wire was un-
like the suave professionally sympa-
thetic ones of the fashionable city physi-
cians to whom she had been accustomed
but when she announced her identity and
the purport of her call it rang with a note
of unstudied human feeling

   your brother you say mrs cayley
died suddenly i know mr benkard by
sight of course shocked to hear it ill
be over right after-

   you dont understand doctor mrs
cayley interrupted in her tensely repressed
tones  mr benkard was injured in some
manner during the night no one seems to
know how it is in your official capacity
that i have called you at the suggestion of
the local carpenter and mason who happens
to be working here for me my brother-
his death was not a natural one

   ah i see in that case i will come at
once please make sure that nothing is
disturbed until i get there and tell geoff
peters to wait thats the man you mean
isnt it

  the kindly voice had crisped with per-
emptory authority and mrs cayley replied
swiftly

   yes

   tell him to give you any assistance you
may need in keeping every one away from
the body till i reach you which will be in
less than twenty minutes good-by

  the instrument clicked abruptly and
after hanging up the receiver mrs cayley
stood for a moment lost in thought great
tremors were shaking her whole body but
into her dry eyes a feverish glitter had
come and a furrow of indecision grew and
deepened between her brows at last she
took the receiver down again and called a
number in xew york city

  while she waited her gaze wandered
about the austere yet subtly luxurious li-

brary where she had seated herself before
the ancient mission table upon which the
telephone stood the impersonal exacti-
tude of the professional interior decorator

was everywhere in evidence but the humi-
dor carelessly left open before her display-
ing a certain brand of cigar with a familiar-
ly flamboyant label the newspapers of the
previous evening crumpled and cast aside
the cunningly concealed cellarette with its
doors now swinging idly ajar the goggles
and motor gloves forgotten upon the top of
the tall bookcase where their owner had
placed them on entering only a short twelve
hours earlier-all these trifling silent wit-
nesses to a living human presence made the
ghastly tableau in the patio seem like the
figment of a disordered dream mrs cay-
ley set her lips more firmly and when a
sleepy masculine voice came at last to her
ears in reply to her call her own tones
wtere under the same iron control as before

   mr lane this is mrs cayley speak-
ing i have frightful news for you and i
must tell you quickly joe is dead

  a sharp inarticulate cry answered her as
though die had struck the man an unex-
pected physical blow and she went on rap-
idly

   carp iound him this morning in the
patio it must have happened soon after
you started back to town last night the
authorities are on their way here now and
i thought as the most intimate friend of
the family you should be notified

   but good god you dont mean-
all traces of sleep had vanished from the
voice now and it was strident with horror
 he wasnt-murdered

  mrs cayley flinched at the word

   it may have been an accident of some
kind but his head has been terribly crushed
--i cant say any more xo one knows-
no one heard anything-

   i understand i-god ive never had
such a shock there was a pause and
then the voice went on  ill be out of
course just as quick as the car can make
it but in the meantime isnt there some-
thing i can do for you here in town joes
attorneys ought to be notified immediately
 yes will you do that please mr lane
tell mr xewbury that i am naturally


argosy-allstory weekly

prostrated and you are acting for me it
is of vital importance to get in touch with
joes office too as soon as it opens and
have william dunn come down here by the
first train

    ill leave word with my own secretary
to have that attended to and ill get new-
bury there isnt anything i can say to
you now mrs cayley but you know how
this has hit me joe-i cant realize it
my god its like a nightmare

   lane paused again as though in an effort
to pull himself together and then added
 just you try to keep your nerve and carry
on until i get there and dont do any more
talking than you have to we dont know
what this may mean for all of us

   i quite understand mrs cayleys
tone had hardened perceptibly  i think
that i shall be able to bear up at least until
you come i was sure that i could count on
you

   to the end mrs cayley im going
to burn up the roads getting there and
every minute is of value now so unless
there is anything else you can suggest for
me to attend to from town here-

    nothing i shall wait anxiously for
your coming good-by

   mrs cayley replaced the receiver and
rising turned to find letty standing in the
doorway

   did you call me maam geoff said
he thought he heard you and i was afraid
maybe you were faint or something

   the womans sharp features were drawn
but a bright spot of color glowed -in each
cheek and her eyes were alight with sup-
pressed excitement

    i didnt call but i shall want you to
come and help me dress immediately mrs
cayley responded u where is geoffrey
dr hood wishes him to wait here without
fail

    i left him gettin henry to lie down
because i heard zeppa stirrin around and
i had to tell her what-what had happened
shes havin regular hysterics and wont be
any use in the kitchen but ive put some
coffee on maam for youve got to keep up
your strength

   mrs cayley dismissed the suggestion
with a gesture of repugnance but a second

thought made her realize its wisdom and
telling letty to bring a cup to her room
she started up the staircase on the gallery
she encountered the mason sauntering from
the direction of henry carps room

   dr hood will be here at any moment
now she informed him  he wants you
to wait here to see him

  geoff nodded

    be right outside mis cayley and
likely see him cornin he replied

  passing on to her own room mrs cay-
ley was on the point of entering when her
daughters door further down the gallery
flew open and mildred appeared upon the
threshold she had dressed in evident
haste and her small white face quivered
with fear

   mother what is it i will know the
truth vera has gone back to her own
room to dress but she told me uncle joe
was ill and neither you nor he wanted me
to go downstairs what does ft mean
mrs cayley slowly approached her
daughter but did not touch her instead
she looked steadily down into the violet-
blue eyes raised to her own and spoke in
a low clear tone strangely devoid of any
natural tenderness

    i have tried all your life to teach you
self-control mildred and the time has come
for you to exert it your uncle is dead
the girls whole slender body quivered
as though under the stroke of a lash and
she caught her breath in a little gasp

  i felt it she whispered i knew
that something dreadful had come mother
how did he die

   look over the railing down into the
patio and you will see

  there seemed to be calculated cruelty in
the coldness of the older womans tone

   remember no scenes we do not
know who is responsible for your uncles
death but in any event there will be end-
less questioning hideous notoriety the
medical examiner-a representative of the
police-is coming and so is stoneham lane
-i have sent for him

   why mildred stiffened and seemed
to grow inches taller as she drew herself up
under the stern commanding gaze bent
upon her  what is he to us
above suspicion



  low as it was her voice rang with an
open defiance that was like a declaration of
warfare and for a moment the two strange
antagonists mother and daughter faccd
each other in silence then mrs cayley
replied with sudden suavity

   our oldest and closest family friend
he will take charge of everything for us
bear that in mind my child when he ar-
rives i will not reproach you now for your
past attitude you knowr of course what
your future one must be your uncles
death has rendered it inevitable that his last
wishes shall be obeyed

  the girls rosebud lips curled over so
slightly

   we are not living in the middle ages
now mother tm not going to pretend any
grief that i dont feel nor acknowledge any
absurd obligation for the future what-
ever else uncle joe may have been he was
no hypocrite nor will i be if mr lane is
coming to act for you as a family friend
my attitude toward him will be becomingly
grateful  can promise you i wonder-i
wonder who-

   heres your coffee maam letty ap-
peared at mrs cayleys elbow with a tray
and the latter directed

   take it into my room please then
to her daughter she added  we will have
a little talk later mildred meanwhile if
you cannot feel any natural grief over the
tragedy which has come upon us i must at
least insist that you showt to every one a
decent respect for your uncles memory
she glanced meaningly toward the room
occupied by their guest vera sherwood
and turning vanished within her own door
left alone the young girl took one tenta-
tive step toward the railing of the gallery
as though to follow her mothers callously
given advice and look down for herself at
the scene

  the next moment with a little shiver
she covered her face with her hands and
fled back into her own room

  meanwhile geoff peters had lingered at
the stairs head until he saw letty emerge
from below when he had hurried down and
out to the terrace where he busied himself
gathering up the loose sections of board
and scattered implements left from his work

of the previous day soon the rattle of an
ancient car approaching at breakneck speed
over the new-cut private road made him
hasten to the driveway

  a stout man of perhaps fifty sat behind
the wheel and beside him was a younger
man as lean and lanky as the mason him-
self but clad in the blue and brass of a
metropolitan police lieutenant a uniform
which seemed as he clambered down to
clothe his awkward frame with almost ludi-
crous incongruity

  hey geoff peters he bustled for-
ward officiously ic whats been goin on
here murder

  et stopped by at the station house for
zeke foster explained the stout man as
he shut off the engine u thought from
what mrs cayley said that hed be needed
you got my message geoff been keep-
ing every one away from the body

  geoff nodded

   got the place all round where it was
found roped off doc he drawled
 reckon i was the first to see it after the
old butler and the hired girl and neither of
them would have gone a nigh it for their
lives its right inside the terrace doors
he turned to lead the way around the
house but zeke foster hurried ahead and
dr hood laid a detaining hand on the ma-
sons arm

   geoff youve been working here pretty
regular since before the family moved
down from the city and you see a lot more
than most folks give you credit for ill
want to talk to you about them later but
whats this look like to you

   i aim to tend to my own affairs doc
geoff shook his head  you better make
up your mind when you see whats hap-
pened to mr benkard if a man could
smash the back of his own head in and go
off and hide the weapon somewheres and
then come back and lay down and die
right in front of where hed been settin
id say it might be suicide but otherwise i
aint offerin no opinion

   humph the doctor ejaculated  so
that was the way of it its a good thing
you thought to rope off the space all around
it in case of footprints

  something like the hint of a grin ap-

peared for a moment at the comers of the
masons wide mouth but he made no re-
joinder as they reached the terrace doors
he silently pointed within

  zeke foster was staring open-mouthed at
the body but the doctor after one swift
glance at it turned to geoff

   give me a couple of those boards there
from that pile youve been using for your
concrete work he directed  im going
to protect the loose sand on the floor from
the mark of another footstep stand aside
zeke

  the lately appointed police lieutenant
obeyed with a surly air placing the boards
carefully in a line from the threshold to
directly beside the dead man dr hood
walked gingerly along them and then knelt
to examine the ghastly wound when he
rose and turned his fat face was very
grave but his eyes snapped with excite-
ment

   more boards geoff-short lengths so
i can make sharp tums with them

   but what is it doc murder sure
enough zeke foster demanded  im
constable-i mean lieutenant-and i got a
right to investigate-

   so has police headquarters now that
were part of the city the doctor interrupt-
ed  its murder all right for theres noth-
ing lying around loose that could have fallen
on him and if it had it would have struck
the top of his head and not the base of the
brain like that unless he was already lying
flat on his face

   better call up the homicide bureau of
the district attorneys office at the county
seat and notify them to send a detective
down here to work with you zeke that
 save your face for otherwise theyll have
a bunch of their owm men down here to
take the case right out of your hands this
family is too rich and prominent and espe-
cially mr benkard himself for the big
fellows to leave the investigation in our
hands know where the phone is geoff
 in the library there where the door
opens under the gallery the mason point-
ed  thats where mis cayley went to
call you while i was gettin henry upstairs
hes the butler and he was struck all of a
heap by findin the body

  zeke foster departed upon his errand
and the medical examiner proceeded to
make a path about the bench with the
pieces of board which geoff handed him
laying each one painstakingly on a smooth
space of sand unmarred by the slightest
touch

  when he had completed the semicircle to
the other side of the terrace doors he
worked his wray back slowly upon his hands
and knees scrutinizing the space on either
side of his improvised path then he rose
and stood staring about the patio while his
companion watched him with a twinkle of
somewhat grim amusement in his mild
brown eyes

   geoff come here a minute dr hood
led him abruptly out on the terrace  who
have you seen around here besides mrs
cayley and her daughter and the hired
help

   only the young lady thats visitin
them a friend o mr benkards who runs
out now and again from the city-lane
his name is-and that young feller from
ashcroft who comes to see little miss
cayley he indicated a neighboring es-
tate the tall ornate chimneys of which
showed above the trees to the west  there
is mr benkards sectary too but i aint
seen him lately

   and the only servants are the cook and
the housemaid and that doddering old but-
ler the doctor persisted

   thats all the garage aint finished
yet and mr benkard drove his own car
and kept it at jakes service station down
to the cove mr benkard used to tele-
phone when he got here and jake would
send one o his helpers up for it there
aint even been anybody else workin round
the place but me since the dty contractors
men quit their job last week

   i heard something about that they
walked out because of a row with mr
benkard didnt they

   geoff rubbed his chin reflectively

   twasnt none o my business he af-
firmed at last  id been doin odd jobs
round-concrete and stucco and a special
mixture o my own that mr benkard liked
the looks of-and he asked me if  could
finish their work on the garage and the ter-
above suspicion



race here i said i could and that was the
end o it

   you didnt hear the men make any
threats before they left dr hood asked

   i wasnt payin tention responded
geoff  i work independent and i had no
truck with them

   you found the housemaid and the but-
ler here with the body this morning the
doctor pursued a new line of questioning

   considerable ways back o where ive
stretched the rope they was round at that
end o the bench geoff gestured toward
the spot

   and you put up that rope geoff peters
so that nobody could track up any foot-
prints the murderer might have left coming
up behind mr benkard where he sat on
this end of the bench there was an odd
note in dr hoods voice  theres blood
spattered on the back of it from the blowr
that killed him before the body toppled
forward but did you look at the sanded
floor yourself

   reckon i did doc geoff chuckled
dryly  seen one set o footprints goin
acrost the court and round the bench to
that end where he was settin

   but you didnt see a second set point-
ed in any other direction did you the
doctor spoke in impatience mixed with an
almost awed bewilderment  they were
his own tracks of course made when he
went there to sit and smoke and two of
his cigar butts are lying close to the body
but that is all there isnt a sign of a foot-
print anywhere around that bench near
enough for any one to have approached and
struck him down 

   thats why i roped it off so particlar
doc geoff remarked chuckling again

chapter iii

a broken friendship

  ive taken mr benkards body down to
my own office maam for of course
you know therell have to be an au-
topsy dr hoods voice was filled writh
respectful sympathy  its only a matter
of form though for there isnt any doubt
of the direct cause of death

  mrs cayley in a straight black gown
which accentuated the portly lines of her
figure leaned across the library table and
spoke in a choking whisper

   you mean that wound on his head doc-
tor

   it was a crushing blow which fractured
the skull at the base of the brain like an
eggshell death must have been instanta-
neous the doctor took off his spectacles
and wiped them carefully  i should
judge from my first examination that it
took place eight or nine hours ago at mid-
night or a little after

   there is no possibility of an accident
her hands clasped and unclasped ner-
vously

   none mrs cayley there was nothing
anywhere about the court which could have
caused such a blow and even if the stone
seats and flower urns had not all been in
their exact positions they are too heavy
for a single person to have lifted any one
of them you had no intimation of this
until your maid knocked at your door and
told you an hour ago

  naturally not she touched her eyes
with her handkerchief  i left my poor
brother in the best of health and spirits
wthen i retired and i heard nothing during
the night

   what time did you retire mrs cay-
ley i am sorry to trouble you with all
these questions now but a representative of
the city authorities is on his way out here
and if i can give him as full an account as
possible of what has occurred and the
events of last night as far as you know
them it may save you much annoyance
there was a significant hint in the doctors
voice that was not on his vts-d-vis and she
shuddered

   i am more than anxious to give the
authorities any help in my power if my
brother was-was done to death-but i can
scarcely realize it she murmured  he
was a man of dominant personality and
quick temper and as such many people
found him naturally antagonistic but i
never heard of any personal enemy of his
-certainly none who would have taken his
life

   i went to my room at a few minutes


argosy-allstory weekly

past eleven last night-my daughter had
already retired-and i was almost imme-
diately followed by miss vera sherwood
our guest who had paused for a moment to
say good night to my brother in the li-
brary she chatted with me for perhaps
ten or fifteen minutes before she left me
and then i went at once to bed i cannot
believe that so soon after-

   she paused as though overcome by her
emotions and dr hood waited for a brief
space before he asked  mr benkard
went to the city yesterday did he not
will you please tell me mrs cayley every-
thing that happened no matter how trivial
from the moment of his return did he
come by train or in his car and was he
alone

    he motored out by himself reaching
here about half past five and said that
mr lane who was to have accompanied
him had been detained but would follow
later in his own car for dinner i refer to
mr j stoneham lane my brothers closest
friend and his associate i believe in several
financial deals although they had formed
no actual business partnership mr lane
did not arrive until nearly seven and we
dined almost immediately

    there wtere no other guests except the
 lady you have already mentioned

   yes-a young man with whom my
daughter had been golfing at the country
club in the afternoon a neighbor of ours
mr rupert ashe you-probably know the
family doctor

   mrs cayleys lips had unconsciously
tightened and her interrogator nodded

    that made yourself this miss sher-
wood your daughter mr benkard mr
lane and young mr ashe-just six in all
at dinner

    that was all we dined most informal-
ly for my house is scarcely finished and my
full staff of servants not yet engaged carp
and letitia have been with me for years
but mazeppa the cook only entered my
service a few weeks ago when we moved
down here to sunny beach

    about last night mrs cayley the
doctor prompted her gently  did every-
thing seem quite as usual during dinner

    oh quite  mrs cayleys eyes opened

wide  we sat in the patio later but at
this end not-not near the terrace doors
we could not make use of the terrace itself
for the special concrete or whatever it is
that the stonemason geoffrey had just
paved it with had not yet dried and hard-
ened but after young mr ashe left-which
was early about nine oclock-my daughter
and mr lane strolled out into the garden
while miss sherwood my brother and i
went to the drawing-room there miss
sherwood played for us are all these de-
tails necessary doctor they seem so in-
consequential in view of the terrible thing
that happened later and i can scarcely col-
lect my thoughts

    it is because of what did occur later
that no incident of last night is inconse-
quential mrs cayley he reminded her
 what happened after that

   my daughter went to bed and mr
lane and mr benkard talked together for
a while in the dining room which is just
across the patio from the library then
mr lane returned to the city and i re-
tired followed by miss sherwood as i told
you

    really doctor i can say nothing more
my brother usually sat up late smoking
and reading or going over his accounts
and last night seemed no exception to the
rule

   her tones had grown more and more un-
feignedly agitated and the doctor took up
a fresh topic

   mr benkard seemed in the best of
health and spirits has he told you of any
difficulty or antagonism he may have en-
countered in his business lately

    he has never discussed his proposed
financial deals with me only my own af-
fairs of which he has assumed complete
charge for several years i am quite sure
that he has experienced no business diffi-
culties but mr lane will be better able to
tell you about that

   she paused and then went on

    i called him up at his rooms in town
immediately after telephoning to you and
although he was inexpressibly shocked of
course he promised to come out as quickly
as his car could bring him he is going to
leave word for mr benkards secretary
above suspicion



mr dunn to follow at once and also no-
tify our family lawyer mr newbury i-
i felt that my daughter and i alone out
here with our guest would need the support
and assistance of my brothers friends and
associates in this terrible hour

   you acted wisely mrs cayley

  dr hood readjusted his spectacles with
which he had been meditatively tapping the
table and rose

   i need not caution you he continued
 that the news of this affair will travel wide
and fast and you will have a crowd of city
reporters out here in no time it would be
better not to have any of your household
make a statement at least until the de-
tective from the county seat conies to take
charge of the case my own investigation
as medical examiner will be separate of
course but ill try to keep you from being
bothered any more than i can help

   i am sure you will doctor mrs cay-
ley rose also and once more her handker-
chief went to her eyes  the loss of my
brother would have been grief enough to
endure but to have the end come in such
a sudden hideous fashion-to know that
the one who is responsible for it is at large
and that we must all be subjected to this
horrible notoriety and disgrace is almost
more than i can face i must try to be
brave though for my little daughters
sake

   that is right the doctor agreed
soothingly  by the way i should like to
see your daughter now for a minute if i
may

   but she can tell you nothing mrs
cayleys hands tightened suddenly until the
wisp of lace and linen between her fingers
was ripped asunder  mildred is just a
child and she is hysterical over this tragedy
which has come upon us it would be a
waste of valuable time i assure you doctor
and needless torture for her at present in her
unnerved condition

   im sorry maam but youll have to
realize that every one in this house--every
one who was here last night or in any way
connected with mr benkard-will have to
lie questioned

  the note of authority sounded once more
in dr hoods tones but before mrs cayley

could expostulate further the hum of a
swift-driven car sounded from the driveway
and she hurried out into the patio and to
the great front entrance doors which she
flung wide

   oh it is mr lane i hardly dared
hope for your coming so soon but i cannot
tell you what it means to me to have you
here-and to mildred too

  stoneham lane leaped from his car and
tearing off his goggled cap he flung it aside
and held out both hands to her he was
a man in the early forties undeniably good-
looking and faultlessly groomed although
his face was pallid now and his eyes hag-
gard

   dear lady i found it hard to believe-
indeed i can scarcely realize yet that your
terrible message is true  he exclaimed  i
have a summons for speeding in my pocket
and i very nearly ditched the car besides
but i came as quickly as i could tell me
in heavens name that there has been some
frightful mistake-that joe has merely been
injured in some way-

   he has been dead since-since almost
midnight mrs cayley gave him her
hands and then added quickly  this is
dr hood the medical examiner he will
tell you what details we know and he wants
to talk to you i believe i will see you
later but now i-i am too much over-
come-

  the doctor gravely acknowledged the in-
troduction neither of the trio observed
the man in overalls who had followed from
the patio where he had been unobtrusively
hanging about the library door and who
now disappeared around the corner of the
house in the direction of the terrace shak-
ing his head perplexedly

  he had just seated himself on the heap
of plaster-stained boards when a youthful
figure in a pedestrian suit with his dark
curly head bare and his boyish face pale be-
neath its healthy coat of tan bounded up
the stone steps from the beach

   hello geoff it isnt true what theyre
saying around the cove that mr benkard
is dead that he was murdered in the
night

   reckon thats about the size o it mr
ashe geoff responded producing his pipe


argosy-allstory weekly

 doc hoods here now and the constable
and that city friend o mr benkards just
come tearin out in his car-that sporty-
lookin fellow lane

  good lord the young man seated
himself heavily beside the mason and pulled
out a handkerchief to wipe his brow which
had suddenly grown damp  where was
he found who did it geoff are you
sure theres no mistake about it-that it was
actually murder

   he was lyin right in front o that
bench you see just inside them doors and
i was the first to see him this mornin after
henry carp and letty dunno who done
it but unless he could bash the back o his
own head in like a ton o brick had fell on
him it was murder all right

   but who-

    thats what doc hood and zeke foster
are here to find out and theyve sent for
some smart aleck district attorneys feller
to help em geoff filled and lighted his
pipe placidly  seems to me i heard the
doc say they was goin to question every-
body that had anythin to do with the fam-
ily and especially all the folks that was here
ast night

  the young man set his teeth hard and
his face flushed

    i was here myself to dinner he re-
marked half-defiantly  i left pretty early
though i cant stand that chap lane say
geoff wheres miss cayley have you
seen her this morning at all i am anxious
to see her

    seems to me i did see her a little while
ago up on the gallery when i come back
from takin henry to his room geoff
took the pipe from his lips and gazed at it
reflectively  taint my business but
you cured that pup o mine o distemper
last summer mr ashe and little miss cay-
ley she-she dont let any dumb beasts git
hurt when shes round seems to me when
i seen her on the gallery she was havin a
high old fuss with her ma and i kinder
think i heard the name  lane  spoke of
now i come to think o it

   damn him the young mans hands
clenched  youre a good scout geoff
do you think shes in her room now can
you get word to her somehow that im

down here and i simply must see her its
underhanded i know but her mother would
make all kinds of excuses if i announced
myself in the regular way-especially just
after-after this has happened though ill
wager shell make her receive lane fast
enough if i go out out the lawn under
her window like some confounded romeo
her mother might spot me and tell me in
short order that my presence wasnt wel-
come now and ive just got to see miss
cayley isnt there some way that you can
let her know

    well geoff knocked the coals from his
pipe and carefully stamped out the live em-
bers  i aint amin to take nothin on
myself but i reckon everybodys kinder
forgot old henry and seems to me i heard
letty sayin somethin about there bein
coffee on the stove mebbe if i was to
take a cup up to him there wouldnt be no
objections and if it happened that i
dropped a piece o paper passin down the
gallery and my foot should shove it acci-
dental like under a door-

  youre a trump young mr ashe
pulled a letter from his pocket and tearing
off the back of the envelope he scribbled
a few words upon it with the blunt stub of
a pencil which his companion offered  the
next time you want any of the stray ani-
mals cured that you pick up and i cant do
it myself ill send for the best vet from
town for you tell her if im not here ill
be on the lowest step of the terrace facing
the beach where they cant see me from the
house

  the note and pencil changed hands and
geoff sauntered indoors and to the kitchen
where he helped himself to a cup of coffee
and started upstairs a low murmur of
voices came from the library but he en-
countered no one on the gallery above he
accomplished his main mission with clumsy
haste and was rewarded by a startled
exclamation in a girlish tone as his foot
thumped against her door before he hurried
along to henrys room

  every one had indeed forgotten the old
butler who had somewhat recovered his
nerve and was almost pathetically grateful
for the coffee to his host of eager ques-
tions geoff replied with his habitual taci-
above suspicion



turnity and then returned to the kitchen
with the empty cup

  there he found a massive dusky female
clad in a purple silk dress and feathered hat
with a bulging grip on the floor beside her
she was rummaging among the cupboard
shelves and turned with a smothered cry at
his entrance

   lawsy man you done mek mah heart
jump right up fn mah mouf dont you tell
nobuddy you seen me gwine till im on mah
way im jest lookin fo mah dream-
book-

   aint fixin to go away are you zep-

ack like butter wouldnt melt in his mouf-
only last night him an dat other genle-
man mr lane had it hot an heavy in de
dinin room

  mazeppa spoke with her back to him
and geoff spied the lurid cover of the
dream-book peeping out from behind the
clock quietly taking possession of that
choice specimen of literature he stuffed
it into the pocket where so recently his cap
and that scrap of soft black glossy fabric
had reposed and then remarked

   reckon youve heard folks havin
words before where you worked and that
didnt have nothin to do with mr benkard
gittin killed because he was all right long

after mr lane had gone back to the city in
that there car o his

as he scratched his head reflectively  i
dunno who the lady could be but taint any
o my business is this what you was look-
in for

  he held out the dream-book and ma-
zeppa pounced upon it with an exclamation
of pleasure then picking up her grip she
started for the door but a bulky thick-set
stranger barred her progress he was in
civilian clothes of a light gray mixture with
a collar too small for his thick bull neck
the smile that spread upon his beefy coun-
tenance was significant as he stepped for-
ward

   not so fast aunty he said  better
make up your mind to stick around a while
longer nobody leaves this house till i say

no men need apply

et me catch another one of them
hanging around you thats all
i threatened pierre marshall

 what will you do asked corinne

    ill do him an injury thats what ill
do returned pierre marshall her father
more threateningly than ever  now see
here my girl ive let you go your own way
long enough and its been a damned bad
way ive seen you in company within a
short six months with five of the most
abominable rogues this city has to show
five ive had to warn off the premises-
abominable rogues gasped corinne
 i like that-

    glad you do retorted her father grim-
ly  i dont

is slsii i -

   abominable rogues she sniffed
  why every one of them is in the social
 register the blue book-

     none of them in duns or bradstreets
 i notice

     my good lord father replied the ex-
 asperated girl  how do you expect me
 to ever get anywhere if you continually act
 as though money were everything-

    ask them-your five friends- ask them
 what they think about it youd pretty
 soon find out that they thought money was
 pretty nearly everything youd darn well
 discover they werent coming to see corinne
 marshall but  old man marshalls heiress
 youd-

   tears started to her eyes  you make
 me feel so cheap-

    glad of that i meant to

    oh she stormed oh oh oh
	 a
her fathers consent



how i hate you what-what right have
you to talk about my friends that way
what right what right

  the rough-hewn elderly face was turned

toward the pretty young one

   what right he repeated wonderingly
 why every right to begin with im
your father you havent any mother
havent had one since you were knee-
high-

  if i had she retorted bitterly  i
might have a chance to be somebody get
somewhere-

   and skipping a lot of other reasons
pierre marshall continued speaking
through her interruption  and going from
beginning to ending theres one of the final
rights i have to speak look it over
from a drawer he had unlocked he drew
out a sheet of paper which he handed her
it was typed under the letterhead of a well-
known detective agency it was a report
turned in by one signing himself  opera-
tive  and it concerned a certain
 robert cushing benham

   thats the gentleman i so unceremoni-
ously ejected to-night before you could get
down to see him again commented her
father in the same grim tone  not that
there was any argument about the ejection
i simply asked him to glance over that sheet
of paper as im asking you to it seemed
to be convincing you heard what i said
to him as you came down the stairs

   yes was her tearful response  you
told him if you ever caught him on your
property again youd have him arrested for
trespassing how can you make me look
so ridiculous how can you  have him ar-
rested for trespassing -

   its nothing to the way hed have made
you look if hed ever had any authority
over you read his record my girl cant
you see from what it says that the man is
nothing but a wastrel living on his familys
reputation and his only prospect in life is
marrying some silly little fool like you-

   thank you she interpolated with icy
mien

   youre welcome im sure read on in
that report and youll see his specialty seems
to be doing what you would call  robbing
the cradle how do you like that part

   	a

where it tells about how he tried to entangle
that little seventeen-year-old schoolgirl tak-
ing her out in that hired car with only
enough gasoline to get them ten miles from
nowhere when naturally it stopped

   and he hoped the scoundrel that by
having kept her out until daybreak-it was
that before he got her home thanks to  los-
ing his way  several times on unfrequented
country roads-hed have her people so
scared of her reputation theyd let her mar-
ry him and settle something handsome on
them but her father had some gumption
thank heaven and kicked him out only
difference between him and me  kicked
him out before he could get you into any
compromising position-

   how do you know it wasnt an acci-
dent responded corinne hotly  these
detectives make their living turning in re-
ports like this-

   yes and if they couldnt prove what
they said theyd find themselves inside a
penitentiary for criminal libel returned her
father wearily  but to satisfy your mind
the head of this agency used to hold high
rank in the secret service and the man
on this case was one of his most trusted
government assistants the same man in-
vestigated your other four friends heres
his reports on them

  he brought a manila envelope out of the
same drawer and drew from it a number
of thin tough sheets of closely typed paper
each headed with the name of the former
secret service chief

   i never meant to tell you about it
he said sternly  i chose to let you think
the other four had simply quit coming of
their own free will but i had every one
of them investigated and when the reports
turned out to be bad-as i expected from
the looks of those particular gentlemen-i
just called each one in in turn and warned
him off race-track gamblers spongers on
their friends eyesores to their families-

   oh oh she broke out again  to
think of having my friends shadowed by
detectives how could you do such a
thing

  to save you from being made a fool
of instead of waiting until it was too late
he replied concisely


argosy-allstory weekly

   vs if i couldnt take care of myself
to be treated like a baby an infant in
arms to-

   dont look like you knew how to take
care of yourself very well was his acid
response  if after reading those reports
you still think they were courting you and
not your fathers money why i think ill
have your head examined

    so she said a dangerous glitter in her
eye as she pushed back the reports unread
 you think i have no attractions of my
own you think that every one who comes
to see me does so on account of your
money well ill show youf ive a good
mind to walk straight out of this house and
marry the very first man i meet ive-

  if the glitter in her eye had been dan-
gerous his was considerably more so

   now see here my good girl he said
trying to keep his voice even although the
veins in his temples were swelling to burst-
ing point  ive let you have your own
way for a long long time and now youve
come to the end of your rope im not go-
ing to interfere with your social engage-
ments-parties dances and dinners but
youll be provided with a car and a chauf-
feur all your own to take you to them and
from them i dont mean my car or my
chauffeur and l dont mean the car you
drive yourself i mean a new closed car
that i shall buy for you to-morrow a sedan
where the chauffeur sits on the inside and
hears every blessed word of talk that goes
on between you and anybody thats with
you and instead of a regular chauffeur i
shall hire one of those drivers employed
by the very detective agency that made
those reports

   what gasped corinne the full enor-
mity of his intentions beginning to dawii
on her

   that driver he pursued inflexibly
 will be your only escort to and from your
dinners and your dances and your parties
and your theaters unless you go with a
crowd accidents will happen of course
and there may be times when you cant get
out of having some man insist on his escort
home i understand that but remember
every word that passes between you will be
heard by that chauffeur and reported to me

along with the mans identity and if the
same man insists on escorting you more than
a couple of times in a month-why hell
hear from me thats all-

   you must be insane she burst out
 trying to make me a laughing stock
wtiy i-

   trying to keep you from being a laugh-
ing stock until you learn better sense re-
member under the laws of this state youre
not of age until youre twenty-one and
during that time youre responsible to me
and im responsible for you so consider-
ing the bad taste youve shown in selecting
your suitors-five bad eggs in six months-
for the next year youre not going to have
any suitors maybe the next one you pick
after the years up will be a good egg for
a change if he isnt-well well talk about
that when the time comes meanwhile
ive made up my mind for the following
year make the best of it

  she looked at him stunned

   you-you cant mean it 

   cant i he answered with a return of
his grim look  well you just try having
another man calling on you for the next
year-thats all if you think its wise
send word youre in wthen the next one
calls but i warn you for his sake as well
as your own youd better send down word
youre out thats all 

  he got up and stalked heavily from the
room leaving the stricken girl sitting there

chapter ii

a squirrel intervenes

thus the period of prohibition began
and continued for three weeks until
a certain morning on the bridle path
in the park even then the violation of
the prohibition was unintentional on co-
rinnes part

  she had always ridden now she rode
more than before since she was aware that
her new chauffeur had been hired from the
detective agency on the day after the quar-
rel at which time the new sedan car was
bought more she was aware that this
new driver-operative had orders to follow
her in her fathers roadster whenever she
her fathers consent



y

took out her own double-seater for a drive

by herself

  the fellow made no particular attempt
to hide this fact he never obtruded but
she knew he was always there but al-
though she was angry with and sullenly
defiant of her father there was no particu-
lar man she wanted to meet clandestinely-
as yet none of the five reported upon had
touched her heart they had been con-
veniences merely-automatons useful to
escort her to dances and to theaters no
more

  and if the others whom she knew could
not call upon her she did not fancy any of
them enough to take chances of being gos-
siped about for meeting them in hotel cor-
ridors or corner drug stores she took to
reading the new books seeing the new
plays and riding of mornings morgan
evans her new chauffeur could not follow
her on the bridle-path at all events he
had no orders to attempt to do so evident-
ly her father thought her matutinal gallops
harmless enough

  so after early chocolate while most of
her friends still slept off their late dances
and the remainder of the city was on its
way to work she would mount red star
head for the long stretches of the park give
the spirited arab his head and go galloping
full tilt for a five-mile run

  one particular morning-perhaps the
most particular of all the mornings of her
life-she was on her way back from such
a run almost out of the park in fact when
an unusual happening enchained her atten-
tion here where the bridle path was
almost paralleled by the city street a num-
ber of hoodlums were gathered making a
great deal of noise throwing a great many
stones and in general making a nuisance of
themselves

  suddenly to her horror as she came
nearer she saw that the stones were being
thrown at a little lame squirrel they had
circled about it in such a way that it could
not scurry off into the underbrush to some
sort of safety whenever it darted to one
side of the road a stone drove it back
when it turned and hurled its little body
at a tree it was only to fall back again
from sheer inability to hold on

  another frenzied attempt to escape by
the ground would again be frustrated by
the grinning hoodlums only their super-
latively poor aim saved the little creature
from being maimed or killed outright co-
rinne as soon as she saw what was happen-
ing slid from her saddle and reins in hand
rushed forward but before she could in-
terfere another and a stronger personality
had made itself felt

  young mr randolph beatty on his way
to the oqjce turned out of an adjoining
path and saw too without words he
swung on his heel and connected with the
point of the nearest hoodlums jaw as the
next to the nearest turned he got a straight
left under the ear stumbled over his fallen
friend and pitched over backward

 damn cowards quoth young mr
beatty and strode toward the lame squirrel
which had just fallen back exhausted from
its dozenth attempt to climb a tree it
tried to bite young mr beatty as he picked
it up but it was a very young squirrel and
randolphs tough dog-skin gloves defeated
its milk teeth and its intentions

  damn cowards he reiterated eying
the squirrels persecutors balefully  what
is that anybody say anything

  apparently no one had the hoodlums
shuffled off on their various ways led by the
two recipients of his fistic prowess

   oh let me please entreated corinne
stretching out her hands utterly forgetful
of red star whose reins fell from them as
she reached randy beatty turned quick-
ly he had been unaware of her presence
she repeated her request

   look out the little devil bites he
warned as he acceded to it and placed the
trembling little squirrel in her hands  oh
-look out he repeated suddenly as the
teeth fastened on a tightly gloved finger
and she gave a little squeal of pain

  her sudden cry following his was one
too many for red star already excited by
the fighting pie turned curveting a
forefoot became entangled in the reins red
star kicked at it only entangling himself
the more

  the horse began to whinny in fright a
red film crossing the whites of his eyes as
he kicked and plunged


argosy-allstory weekly

    get out of the way ordered randolph
beatty sternly pushing corinne from the
bridle path it was well for her that she
was with some one who knew horses and
who was unafraid for red star had
whipped himself into a frenzy and was
plunging and kicking like some wild stal-
lion just brought in from the range

   eyes on the horses small but dangerous
steel-shod hoofs randolph beatty circled
him warily then plunging in at an oppor-
tune moment released the entangled hoof
without hesitation he followed this up by
seizing the bridle while he used the other
hand to throw the reins back in place

   even as he did this he knew the spirited
arab was in a panic and that there was
but one follow-up to all this so shifting
his hold from bridle to saddle he threw
himself upward holding the reins and a
handful of the horses mane with his other
hand with a foot in one stirrup the other
stirrup swinging beatty kept his seat as the
graceful steel-shod hoofs drummed out a
wild farewell to corinne

   red star head lowered nostrils snorting
out smoky puffs of hot breath on the win-
ter air until he looked like some horse of
diabolic myth tore along the woodland
path headed for the streets and home

   oh hell be kiiled-hell be killed
moaned the girl but she meant the man
not red star

   the squirrel the cause of it all lay quiet
in her two hands she had forgotten him
she was watching his savior

  randolph had two alternatives either
he must turn the horse before it plunged
into the city traffic-turn him completely
and let him run out his fright-or else he
must fight him then and there he tried
the first but only succeeded in having red
star shy terrifically almost unseating him
and hurling him against the nearest tree
then randy knew he must try the second
for the city streets were ever nearer once
precipitated into the swirl of motors street
cars omnibuses and the like with a fright-
ened runaway horse only the most frightful
sort of end must ensue

   corinne running and panting after him
saw the superb battle without spurs with-
out even proper riding breeches that would

give his knees a chance to grip as they
should randy fought red star corinne
saw him literally standing up in his stir-
rups the snaffle abandoned the curb rein
drawn tighter ever tighter as both hands
slowly forced the horses head around
head once turned he let the curb chain
slacken and the infuriated horse took his
turn at standing up shaking his forefeet in
air pawing and snorting like a demon

  when he came down it was four-legged
and with a terrific thump then he threw
his heels in air randolph had caught
him by the mane when he reared and had
managed somehow to keep his hold when
the animal bucked bronchos might have
taken lessons in bucking from red star
several times the man seemed to slide on his
nose along his mounts neck

   he let out another handful of curb rein
and red star with a mighty leap in air
started down the woodland path again in
the direction from whence he had come

  corinne had watched the struggle be-
tween man and beast her heart thumping
her forehead wet with perspiration for all
the winter cold now when red star swept
by like the very wind itself she clutched
at her throat it was frightful yet some-
how glorious-the sight of that exhausted
boy his coat streaming out behind him
his hat gone his hair in his eyes both stir-
rups swinging riding like a jockey his
knees gripping the horses withers almost
at saddle level his face buried in the mane
he showed no sign of giving up

  the sound of the thudding hoofs died
away as she stood there mechanically she
unbuttoned one of the big patch pockets of
her heavy tweed riding coat and thrust the
lame squirrel into it rebuttoning the pocket
then she turned too pausing to pick up
the boys hat and overcoat where he had
dropped them before he mounted in the
anxiety and fear that followed the tense
excitement of the fight something was bom
within corinne-something to which for all
her previous flirtations she had hitherto
been a stranger

  when a few moments later she heard
the returning thud of hoofs and then saw
as they turned a curve the steady rise and
fall of the man in the saddle as the horse
her fathers consent



trotted beneath him she breathed a prayer
of thankfulness

   hes all right now wheezed randy as
he dismounted

  as boy and girl stood eye to eye a
steady look from him set her pulses to beat-
ing faster if possible

   how can i thank you-for-for every-
thing she began breathlessly  oh i
dont know how to tell you how much i
admire your courage and pluck and-

   please dont he panted unhappily

   but i must at least i cant but i
must try she said confusedly  if i only
knew how to show how grateful-

   you can he gasped out but in his
eyes was the same steady look  that is
i-i-i dont want you to be grateful but
if anything i did makes you li-like-like me
a little im glad because i want to ask
a great favor i want you to let me see
you again

  he had spoken with the utmost simplic-
ity there was no hint of the flirtatious in
his earnest manner as he stood there out of
breath disheveled torn yet forgetful of all
this and of the cold as well not even putting
on the hat and coat she had handed him
sincerity begets sincerity and she answered
without thinking

   oh i want to see you again too

  then she blushed

   id stay now and talk to you he went
on in the same earnest way  but im due
at the office now and ill be awfully late
as it is for i shall have to go home and
change my clothes so if you wont think
it a liberty or presuming on whats hap-
pened id like to make an engagement
my name is randolph beatty he added
 and im from tidewater virginia you
could write and ask about me write the
episcopal rector at st marys he chris-
tened me

   youll find theres-well no reason you
shouldnt know me he concluded awk-
wardly  only new yorks such a place
-nobody knows anybody i might be lord
knows how long getting some one to intro-
duce us

   my name is corinne marsh she an-
swered deleting the ultimate syllable of her
name while he had been talking she had

decided on her course her fathers state-
ment that her suitors had come to see not
corinne but  old man marshalls heiress
had bitten deep the thought had re-
mained with her that she could never tell
when it was herself who was admired rather
than her fathers money

  here was the chance to find out this
frank-eyed boy who had won her admira-
tion so quickly by his fearlessness and
whose appearance and manners were so de-
cidedly attractive had struck a spark that
none of the others had kindled she want-
ed to be sure he wanted to see her and her
alone

  moreover her fathers ukase that she
could have no one to call on her made it
necessary that they should meet in secret
anyhow that gave her a good excuse for
pretending to be some one else-some one
who had nothing to give a man except her-
self

  first however the horse must be ex-
plained

   i-i must be getting back to the acad-
emy too she went on  you know im
employed by a riding academy to give les-
sons to young ladies and to get horses ac-
customed to park riding for them this
one is new at it ill have a good deal of
practice for him yet hes easily scared

  she had been watching randy carefully
and she detected immediate relief when she
spoke of her employment it seemed as if
a barrier had been swept away when he
spoke again

   well thats fine he said heartily  i
would like that job myself i was brought
up with horses but only rich people cam
afford them in the city it must be nice
to combine work and pleasure as you do
but you havent told me where i shall meet
you miss marsh and when im off at
five in the evenings

   im sorry i have no place of my own
to invite you to she said  you know
how it is in new york with people who
have to work-a single room in a decent
neighborhoods about all i can afford but
theres a little tea shop near the academy
and near my place too i could meet you
there almost any afternoon by the time you
get uptown-say at five thirty i have to

 be at the riding academy at night off and
 on she added hastily  giving lessons you
 know

   she gave the address

   to-ni-to-morrow then he asked
somewhat wistfully

   she saw to her great joyr that he would
 have asked for that very day had he dared
 she accepted gracefully and he helped her
 to mount again a movement in her pocket
 reminded her

    the little squirrels there she said
 gayly im going to have him looked
 after at the bide-a-wee home its only
 right he introduced us i owe him some-
 thing

   and with a gay laugh noting the flush
of pleasure that came to his cheek she
touched red stars flank and was off-off
to pat monahans stables and fashionable
riding school to warn the old irishman de-
voted to her since the days of childhood
when she guided her little sheltie around
his tan bark that should any one inquire
he employed miss corinne marsh as a
teacher of riding

   she also stopped on her way home at
the residence of a former maid whom she
still employed for sewing to secure from
her a key with which she could admit her-
self to the maids house whenever young
mr beatty insisted on seeing her  home
she explained to the maid that she lived
there in case of inquiries corinne inherit-
ed her fathers thoroughness

    now daddy we shall just see she
thought defiantly when these arrangements
were concluded  well see if i cant have
a man admire me for myself-and if i cant
see him when i choose

chapter iii

old pierre scents mystery

the course of  true love  ran
 smoothly  enough for another
month and might have continued to
do so had it not been for mr c sylvester
donaldson young mr donaldson be-
lieved in the  cave-man  type of wooing
meeting corinne for the first time at a
dance some twenty-nine days after her en-

counter with randy in the park and un-
conscious of the fact that another was in
the race for her heart he did not ask her
if he might accompany her home that night
he simply came

  corinne unfortunately was too polite
to humiliate him before her new chauffeur
when he crowded into her car she found
cause to regret her toleration when the
following afternoon instead of asking her
if he might call he simply called both
facts being reported to her father pierre
marshall drew some erroneous conclusions
had he heard the excoriation young mr
donaldson received when corinne came
down he would not have summoned morgan
evans made certain inquiries and thus
stumbled on a false trail

  before he asked evans any questions at
all he expected to find in her actions some-
thing suspicious

   and he found it

   you say youve left miss marshall in
the afternoons at various young ladies
houses during the past month and that
each time shes said she would be there
several hours and you werent to wait in
the cold because shed take a taxi home
h-m such consideration from her is al-
mighty suspicious how many times did
that happen

   evans began checking off on his fingers
and said as far as he cpuld remember about
a dozen times maybe

   old pierre rang for simpkins the butler
and demanded to know at what hour miss
corinne had returned the previous after-
noon being informed  just in time for
dinner he desired in an ominous voice
to be informed how often this had happened
lately

    lots of times sir answered simpkins
trembling  shes changed a lot in the past
few weeks used to take all hours to dress
with her maid helping her now she does it
in ten minutes-sometimes without a maid
did it last night sir again

   how about this evans asked old
pierre in a voice of thunder

    i took her to a matinee at the unique
sir returned the operative-chauffeur  she
said i wasnt to call afterward as her lady
friends were taking her to tea
her fathers consent



   h-m show out twenty minutes to five
dare say but she doesnt return until three
hours later how often did you leave her
at shows and she tell you that

  evans thought perhaps half a dozen
times

   thats about eighteen afternoons she
disappears for three hours ill be damned
if she isnt up to something now listen
to me evans ill see a watch is kept on
her so that whenever she goes out youll be
notified in time to bring the car around
and ill tell her myself i insist on her using
it the very next time she tells you youre
not to wait whether its at a theater or at
a girls house you wait anyhow if its
the theater park where you can leave the
car and watch all entrances and exits -if
its at a house park around the comer and
watch for her to come out and follow her
wherever she goes when you do that try
to discover whos with her without letting
her know shes watched then when you
have found out both things-where she
goes and whom she meets-report back to
me

   very good sir

  as a result of this maneuver evans re-
turned to the marshall house the next eve-
ning a little after six and sent word by
simpkins that he wanted to see mr mar-
shall

  he was directed to go up to that gen-
tlemans dressing room there before a
fire of sea coal in a renaissance fireplace
wearing a gorgeous persian silk dressing
gown with slippers to match lined with per-
sian lambs wool sat pierre marshall the
aroma from a long panatella cigar between
his teeth filling the room

   lock the door take one of these spe-
cials of mine he pushed the plain white-
banded box of cigars toward the operative
 sit down and take your time he said

   i left her at miss graysons again but
instead of coming back as she told me i
did what you told me she came out in
fifteen minutes or less and looked up and
down ihe street carefully however i was
well hidden so it didnt matter then she
set off on foot me following

   from the distance i had to keep i
saw her meet a gentleman outside the en-

trance of a little tea shop they went in
i came up and managed to peer in between
the curtains in such a way as not to at-
tract attention the mans back was to
me but from what i sawr of that young
donaldson the other night i shouldnt be
surprised if it was he from the distance
when i saw him outside standing he
seemed to be the same height and from
where he sat i could see he had that same
kind of crisp almost curly light-brown hair
you told me you did not want her to sus-
pect so i didnt dare make any closer in-
spection-

  pierre marshall bounced out of his chair
 i knew it was that damned young don-
aldson she was meeting well ill soon put
a stop to that listen to me evans

  evans listened

  as a result of that interview young mr
beatty waited in vain one afternoon two
days later-waited so long that the police-
man on fixed post a half block away won-
dered if the young man was a plainclothes
man waiting for some suspect or a suspi-
cious character himself

  it was only after several hours that the
young man finally accepted defeat and
repaired to the riding academy to interview
old pat monahan

   sure miss marsh is out of the city for
a few days said the old irishman with
ready mendacity when the case was made
plain to him

  privately he was sorry for this good-look-
ing well-mannered boy and wroth with his
young lady for having taken him up only to
drop him

  he determined to warn her by telephone
that unless she played fair he intended to
expose the whole box of tricks but when
he attempted to reach corinne by phone he
found that more difficult than he had im-
agined

  one voice over the wire asked him to
wait a second voice demanded to know
who it might be who wanted miss mar-
shall monahan recognized the second
voice as pierre marshalls--recognized also
the danger note in it-and decided it would
not be wise to go into too many details
he did not know why he simply sensed it
men who spend a good part of their lives

with animals often develop this sense of
danger

    just say its a friend he answered
 cautiously

    that wont do came in pierre mar-
shalls crispest tones  ill have to know
who it is wants to speak to her before i can
call her to the telephone

    never mind then returned pat and
 hung up

chapter iv

randy decides to act

on the following morning randy
beatty arriving dispiritedly at the
office found a letter in an unfamil-
iar handwriting that sent his pulses leaping
he had left monahans to go to the address
which he believed was the girls home and
where she had written  marsh  above the
name of her former maid here he heard
an entirely different story from monahans
the flustered seamstress had told the first
lie that came into her head

   because of this conflicting testimony and
 the broken engagement randy beatty in
 the course of a sleepless night had dis-
 covered just howt much he had cared for
 the girl he had known so short a time next
 morning at sight of the letter he knew at
 once it was from her

  everything would be explained now-
quite satisfactorily he would see her again
and this time he would say what he had
to say without further ado tell her he loved
her and ask her to marry him but when
he had read the letter he saw it was not
going to be so easy it consisted of but a
few lines

     circumstances have made it extremely hard
   for me to see you if you will manage to be
   inside monahans academy to-morrow-the
   day after you reccive this-morning by eight
   oclock and will hide upstairs in the harness
   room i will try to see you and explain

     show this to monahan when you come and
   he will arrange it for you tell him not to let
   any one else know you are there

                                  corinne

   randy beatty stared at the note and
stared and stared and stared again what
it signified he had not the slightest idea

he felt like a young man in a mystery se-
rial he had read of such situations and
had seen many more at the movies but had
hardly believed they were to be encountered
in real life

   once he realized this was real he broke
out into a fever of fright for her safety
he did not wait but hurried off to mona-
hans at lunch time to make his arrange-
ments for the morrow and to inquire if
any further news of her was to be had

   old pat shook his head gravely remem-
bering the voice at the other end of the
telephone

    youd best be stepping carefully me
lad he warned  yere getting into deep-
er wathers than ye know alxmt and if
th young miss dont tell you about the
same to-morrow tis meself that will ill
have no further hand in it that i wont

   persuasions were vain so far as learning
any more from him at the moment ran-
dolph left even more puzzled and troubled
than when he had entered itseemed as if
the hours between noon and moming would
never come to an end needless to say
he did very little sleeping that night and
had bathed shaved dressed and was on
the street next moming long before there
was any occasion for him to be there even
the stables attached to the riding academy
had not yet opened when he arrived there
although there were many early riders it
was not until he found them closed that
he remembered he had not had any break-
fast

  he repaired to a near-by lunch room
and ate something hurriedly although there
was no actual need of hurrying the place
had barely opened when he returned he
repaired to the harness room upstairs with a
morning paper and waited

  the waiting seemed interminable he
could not read his paper he could only
sit at a discreet angle and watch the street
finally the car containing corinne ap-
peared she got out and ran into the
riding academy while the car drove away
she burst into the room all in a flurry

  randy had risen to meet her now
without realizing that he had never ad-
dressed a word of love to her in his life nor
had any assurance of affection from her in
her fathers consent



return he stepped toward her with a glad
cry and caught her into his arms

   oh my dear my dear he almost
choked  how youve worried me and how
i love you i didnt know how much until
i waited for you and worried about you
he held her tight and kissed her then
almost as an afterthought he added
 you do love me dont you

  she wriggled out of his arms with a sound
that was half laugh half cry  thats a
funny question to ask after what ive just
let you do to me do you think id let
any man id known such a short time hold
me in his arms and kiss me ff i didnt love
him oh my dear yes im afraid i do
love you

   afraid you do

   afraid yes but we must hurry we
havent much time didnt you notice my
chauffeur was in riding clothes too

   i didnt notice anything but you dear
and-

  she held him off

   wait its wonderful to lie in your
arms like that but we havent the time
hes only gone to put the car in the garage
around the block then hell be back to ac-
company me on my ride to see that i dont
meet anybody thats why i couldnt meet
you the day before yesterday my fathers
got on to our meetings somehow-

   your father but you let me think-
 i was an orphan earning my own living
i know well im neither i lied to you
because-because randy i was so tired of
having men around me who wanted a
chance to marry my fathers dollars and
the opportunity of meeting some one who
didnt know who i was and whom i liked
from the first-

   did you darling

   i certainly did from the very first
when you fought for poor little bebe-

   bebe

   thats the squirrels name its a she-
squirrel its back from the bide-a-wee
all healed and it has a little house all its
own on my window sill but goodness i
cant stop to tell you any more this morn-
ing when i dont know how long hell take
i mustnt let his suspicions be aroused

   whose

   this chauffeurs he isnt a chauffeur
at all but some sort of a detective hired to
watch me you see fathers forbidden me
to have any men calling on me even for a
year as i am not of age but darling
i cant stay here any longer im afraid be
here to-morrow morning at the same time
and ill try to tell you more well know-
how long it takes him to garage the car
then

  he caught her in his arms this time
hers went about his shoulders and she held
up her face to be kissed then with a
little laugh of happiness she was gone

  it was not until several mornings had
passed that randolph beatty gathered the
true state of affairs it took some time for
corinne to admit that her father had been
justified in investigating the antecedents of
her previous suitors although there had
been nothing between  any of them and
herself

   but of course he couldnt know that
she admitted c and now he looks on me
as such a fool that he simply wont allow
me to have any man calling as i said
hes found out about our meeting although
somehow he thinks youre a fool named
sylvester donaldson whos been trying to
force himself upon me

   so i didnt let on-just let him think
you were and now hes gone and hired
another detective to watch the house and
grounds to see that i dont slip out with-
out any one knowing about it and heres
this one evans to drive me everywhere and
ride behind me

   im not allowed to go anywhere that he
cant wait for me with the car and no man
is allowed to ride in it with me my fa-
thers serious dearest he swears if i dont
obey him in this hell pack me off to a
convent until my twenty-first birthday and
im not twenty yet so this is our only
chance of seeing each other for a few mo-
ments every morning

   no said randolph beatty grimly
 thats no way to go on with our love
why youd soon tire of the man who hadnt
even enough manliness to be able to see his
girl in the open no youve got to marry

   marry you but how can i


argosy-allstory weekly

    you can well enough all youve got
 to do is to walk right out of here to-morrow
 morning with me and be married come
 on what dyou say

   she caught her breath in a little gasp of
 disappoin tment

    oh id like to she breathed  but
 i couldnt-i couldnt you see ive given
 my -word of honor that man evans was
 going to park the car in the street and
 leave it here the first morning unless i
 gave him my word of honor i wouldnt at-
 tempt to run off while he took it to the
 garage and every morning he still makes
 me give him my word of honor i couldnt
 break that

   randys forehead wrinkled

    no he agreed grumblingly  you
 couldnt do that

    and yet this is the only chance i get
 to see you she wailed  oh it does seem
 so cruel what can we do

    weve got to do something he re-
 turned sternly  my self-respect wont
 permit this sort of thing to go on i love
 you and you love me and i want you to
 marry me theres nothing to be ashamed
 about in that is there i didnt even know
 your father had any dollars when i first
 asked you to marry me and i dont need
 any of them now

    dont you randy

    no i dont he returned sturdily-
  not if youre willing to live on what i
 make which isnt so bad in my opinion
 if we live outside the city we can even af-
 ford a car-a small one you drive yourself
 understand no limousines or chauffeurs i
 wonder if youre willing though

   she looked at him reproachfully

    you know i am or i wouldnt love you
 very much would i

   he agreed as to that  now the only
 thing is to figure out how to get you where
 we can be married you say theres no
 chance of your slipping away

    no she replied  because whenever
 i go to see any one the car waits outside
 for me and my father has compelled me to
 give my word that if he allows me to go to
 theaters dances and the like i will make
 no attempt to leave before the car comes
 for me it is like it is here this morning

 if i do not give my word im not permitted
 to go my father knows he can trust me
 when i give my word and i know if i
 broke it to him i might break it to you-
 to anybody isnt that true

    yes he admitted  thats true enough
 well theres only one thing to do then
 we must elope from your house some
 night

    but how can we she asked with a
little cry  that detective is on duty
there i never know when he is asleep and
his room is directly over mine and this
other man evans is in the garage

    never mind said randolph beatty
taking her in his arms  when you come
to-morrow morning bring the plan of the
house with you make a sketch of it for
me with the location of the various rooms-
yours your fathers-every ones mean-
while ill manage to get a good look at the
place from the outside ill go there pre-
tending to be a book agent or something
and get a chance to look the ground over
you just leave things to me little girl

   from the trustful look in her eyes as she
 raised them you might have imagined
 young mr beatty was some conquering
 general instead of merely the office manager
 at johnson and selkirks incorporated
 wholesale teas coffees and spices

chapter v

the great plan

 it was two mornings later when the final
 scene for the great elopement was finally
 settled upon the morning before co-
 rinne had brought the rough plan of the
 marshall house interior she already knew
 that randy had visited the house on the
 previous afternoon for from her second-
 story window she had seen him in the dusk
 coming up the graveled walk a leather dis-
 patch case under one arm and a parcel of
 books under the other

   she had lost sight of him under the port-
 ico but a few moments later had seen
 him come down the stone steps and cross
 the lawn toward the garage she had hur-
 ried to a hall window and had caught an-
 other sight of him in conversation with ri-
her fathers consent



   ley the garage man he was arguing and
   spreading out printed  literature taken
   from the dispatch case

      riley proving obdurate randy had fol-
    lowed the hedge around to the back of the
    house evidently he had asked riley where
    the servants entrance was and was on his
    way there from another coign of van-
    tage at her bathroom window on the other
    side of the house corinne was presently
    given a sight of her lover trudging from the
    rear to the front again he had thus com-
    pletely circled the house and grounds and
    made himself as familiar with the marshall
    exterior as was possible in one visit he
    had returned again that night for a short
    visit of inspection

       after giving him her rough sketch the
      next morning she left with his assurance
      that everything would now be arranged
      nicely she did not see him on his second
      or third trip to the house in fact no one
      saw him for he did not enter the grounds
      at either time and he waited until dark be-
      fore coming since the elopement was to
      occur at night he wanted some assurance as
      to the lay of the land under the starlight
      now that he knew whose rooms they were
      he could plan better the second night than
      the first	

          although a bitterly cold wind had sprung
        up after dark randy spent the evening in
        the open watching the marshall house from
        various outlying points several times he
        found it necessary to retreat to the drug

i i store down the adjoining block and warm
himself with hot chocolate before he could
continue his watch

each time he returned he took up a place
at a different angle he saw the lights ex-
tinguished in mr marshalls room at a lit-
tle after ten in the detectives above co-
rinnes they remained lit until well on to
midnight evans evidently remained awake
until long after that his light was not ex-
tinguished until close to one

even when randy took his leave co-
         rinnes still glowed she was having a hard
         time to sleep these days as the pile of new
         novels on her little marquetry night table
         testified along with the pile of pillows that
         propped up her head as she lay reading by
         the rose-pink-shaded electric lamp

  but that was her last night of sleeplessr
  ness he assured her the following moming

 his plans were perfected now that night
 they would be together whirling on their
 way to greenwich connecticut where they
 could be married at any hour without a li-
 cense after that-their honeymoon

  oh randy darling she breathed as
 they clung together in the old harness room

  do you think-are you sure-you can
 do it

 leave it to me he returned grandly

   all you have to do is to be ready dressed
  by eleven say and wait have your bag
  all packed-

   i couldnt get everything i needed in
  one bag she protested  ill have to
  bring two at the very least maybe three
  you know father is liable to be so angry he
  wont send my trunk at all so id better
  take-

       all right all right he interrupted
    hurriedly  we havent got any too much
    time so listen this is the way i have it
    fixed that second detective the one with
    the room above yours makes a sort of in-
    spection of the grounds before he goes to
    bed i dont know what he calls it but he
    comes out and strolls down to the gate and
    back to the garage and goes in there and
    stays about five minutes or so-speaks to
    evans i suppose

    then he comes out and goes in the
   house by the back way now what is go-
   ing to happen to him is this im going to
   be waiting in the shadows just outside the
   front door-between the inner doors and
   the storm doors-and when he comes out
   two things are going to happen to him

        what she asked excitedly

         well first hes going to trip over a rope
       ill have fastened across between the two
       foot-scrapers in the vestibule before he
       can recover from the shock of his fall ill
       be sitting on his shoulders pressing a chloro-
       form sponge to his nostrils oh ive looked
       it all up it wont be enough to do him any
       real harm only make him unconscious

          at the same moment i press the sponge
       to his nose ill shove a handful of raw cot-
       ton in his mouth in case of him making any
       outcry hes a good big hefty fellow but
       then so am i and my weight on his back


argosy-all story weekly

 added to the stunning hes had from the
 fall will be enough to keep him down until
 the chloroform takes effect

   remembering the force her lover had ex-
 hibited in his fight with the hoodlums and
 the subsequent battle with red star co-
 rinne thrilled with pride and excitement

    yes she breathed reaching out a
 timid hand to touch her hero who was dar-
 ing so greatly to win her he caught it
 and carried it to his lips  yes and
 then-

   u then he proceeded his head thrown
 back his eyes shining  i intend to walk
 across to the garage just as if i were the
 other fellow who meanwhile i shall have
 dragged out of sight and propped up at the
 extreme end of the dark porch i noticed
 the garage door was left unlatched so i
 shall walk in and walk heavily up the stairs
 just as the other fellow does riley goes
 to bed early-about nine thirty-and the
 other fellow your fathers driver doesnt
 get in until all hours and his room is be-
 tween rileys and evanss so when i
 walk into evanss room and shut the door
 behind me quickly what we have to saj
 wont be likely to be heard by any one fast
 asleep so-

    what will you say demanded co-
 rinne breathlessly

    well ill have slipped a half mask on
 before i enter the room and ill have my
 revolver in one hand and a pair of hand-
 cuffs in the other evans will doubtless
 take me for some desperate burglar and
 ill speak gruffly and act just as though i
 were

     put up your hands  ill say  now
 turn around now bring your hands to-
 gether behind you and put the wrists close
 no funny business now ill add  this gun
 has got a maxim silencer on it 

    where will you get it she asked
 eagerly interrupting

    i wont ill have a contraption fas-
 tened to it that looks like one-comes off
 a toy maxim silencer pistol i saw in a shop
 window one day and remembered when i
 thought of this well to continue ill
 say

     stick your wrists close together and
 hold em that way if you make one funny

 move or one attempt to call out youll be
 dead before you know what hits you the
 man whos sleeping in that room beyond
 wont hear a thing it  just be a click
 and-bingo-youre gone ive used these
 things before ill add in a sinister sort of
 tone  and they kill as quickly as they kill
 noiselessly so dont think you can get
 away with anything-anything 

   she giggled in appreciation

    do you think hell-

    i know he will its not everybody can
 face even a drawn revolver leveled at them
 but ill bet that the thought that the thing
 can kill them without a sound is too much
 for the strongest nerve youll see well
 when he turns and puts his hands together
 ill put the cuffs on him then ill tie his
 legs with some strong manila rope ill bring
 and then ill gag him lock the window and
 the door and put the key in my pocket

    all this will be about eleven or eleven
 thirty the other chauffeur comes in
 around midnight or later the first night
 i came here late the same night i visited
 here in the afternoon before i got your
 sketch muller came in at twelve ten last
 night he hadnt come in at all when i left
 i didnt explain about my night trips be-
 fore for fear it would worry you

   it would have but-

   we havent any time to waste now
evans will be back any minute now from
eleven on to-night be ready and listening
for my whistle have your window down
from the top so you can hear when you
do take your bags and slip downstairs as
noiselessly as possible ill be hiding lie-
hind the garden hedge waiting and ill
leave the garage doors unbolted so as soon
as i see you ill push your roadster down
off the concrete floor and onto the incline
it  pick up speed and the engine will
start without noise or use of the starter

    then ill sling your bags in and you
 after them and well be off be ready to
 sing out  its all right riley in case he
 should hear anything id hire a car only
 if your father wanted to catch us that
 would be an absolute tip-off besides they
 wont hire out cars without their drivers
 unless they know you tell me which
 roadster is yours and which your fathers
her fathers consent



  she described her own hurriedly for
evans was to be seen approaching down the
street then with a quick embrace and
an adjuration on his part  keep up your
pluck they parted

    for the last time she said

    thats right he whispered  after this
well be together for good-my little wife
he smiled very well pleased with him-
self and enraptured with the thought of
their future together then his face set in
grim lines as he realized the serious job yet
ahead of him before he won her for good
and all as soon as he heard her and evans
clatter off he set about arranging affairs for
the night

  but all day he was haunted by one un-
easy thought was it after all fair to her
father this high-handed abduction of his
daughter pierre marshall had only done
what he had done to protect corinne and
from all that she admitted randy was not
sure she had not needed that protection
he burned with indignation at the thought
of his little girl a prey for idle languid
fortune hunters who wanted none of her
sweetness nor charm but only the money
that would come from her father

  little by little ever since she had told
him why she was kept under surveillance
he had found himself blaming old pierre less
and less and on that particular day the
disagreeable thought that he would be do-
ing him an injustice persisted though he
went about his work of preparing for the
elopement buying the properties necessary
for staging his little melodrama and obtain-
ing the leave from his office requisite for a
honeymoon that uneasy feeling would not
down

  it came to a climax just before the great
  elopements machinery was put into action

chapter vi

the greater plan

  for the third and last time randy
  beatty had so to speak taken up an
  observation post opposite the enemys
  trenches at nine thirty from various an-
  gles he had begun a third evening of es-
  pionage no doubt beset him as to the ulti-

mate outcome of his scheme he was glo-
riously youthfully certain that single-
handed he was going to be able to master
those two guardians of his ladys liberty
no fear of accident or slip-up beset him

  he looked upon the entire arrangement
almost as a play that had been rehearsed
and was bound to go through according to
schedule no that was not what troubled
him

  as he stood there in the cold--snow had
begun to fall besides-changing his post
occasionally and once more beginning to
think of trips after hot chocolate all that
bothered him was his duty to his future
father-in-law

  after all it was a serious matter to snatch
away an only child from a father who loved
her while randy was young and inex-
perienced enough to think nothing of the
fortune he was thereby throwing away he
possessed sufficient decent sentiment to real-
ize it was rather awful this estranging a
father and a daughter forever

  moreover he knewt although corinne
was infuriated with old pierre now for-
getful of the old affection in the new love
the love that had come into her life with
him randy she was bound down deep in
her heart to care a great deal for her
father

  and once she took the irretrievable step
she would soon discover how much her
father had meant to her the heartache
that would ensue would do much to militate
against their marital happiness

  randy loved corinne enough to realize
all this the more he thought of it the
more his indecision increased he must do
something to obviate this thing he must
not start his married life with a handicap
what to do

    he glanced at his wrist watchs radiolite
  dial lord only ten after ten it seemed
  to him he had been there hours he wrig-
  gled in supreme discomfort not on account
  of the cold but because of his inner emo-
  tions

   he looked across at the house the
  light in pierre marshalls dressing room was
  not yet lit no doubt the old gentleman
  was downstairs dozing over his evening pa-
  per quite unaware of the awful event


argosy-allstory weekly

 about to befall randolph beatty could
 not stand the thought of how old pierre
 would feel when he awoke to discover his
 only child gone

   an old man-alone his last years em-
 bittered-his lonely death-

   randy moved in an agony of indecision
 he started slowly toward the comer drug
 store then suddenly he stopped with
 a quick firm step he crossed the street di-
 rectly toward the marshall gate

   randy had come to a sudden decision
 pierre marshall should have his warning
 anyhow he should know with whom he
 had to deal know that a decent enough
 fellow loved his daughter and wanted her
 for his wife he randy did not blame
 him for his opposition to the fortune hunt-
 ers he was perfectly willing to be investi-
 gated himself

   and he would tell him so

   without making any reference to the
 proposed elopement he would inform pierre
 marshall who and what he was and why
 he wanted his daughter for his wife then
 if pierre chose to be unreasonable let it
 fall on his own head

   randy did not doubt that he would be
 unreasonable after all that had happened
 but at least that would be open war then
 he would not be fighting in the dark
 pierre would at least know that the fellow
 his daughter had eloped with was no skulk-
 er nor yet any blackguard who was marry-
 ing corinne with the hope of extorting some
 of her fathers dollars afterward

   under such circumstances there was a
 chance of reconciliation later the other
 way there would have been none the two
 households would have been inexorably un-
 reconciliable this way-

   it was worth trying anyhow if he loved
 her it was the only decent thing to do if
 he loved her it was his duty to think of her
 future happiness

   he crossed the street opened the gate
 walked up the graveled walk and rang the
 bell he did not know that as he passed
 through a patch of light cast by the two
 white globes whose pillars guarded the gate
 of the garden he had been observed by co-
 rinne from her second-story aerie where her
 face was glued to the pane watching

  a moment later she heard the doorbeil
ring and felt a sharp stab of pain at her
heart noiselessly she glided over the thick
velvet pile of the upper-hall carpet and
came half down the stairs-down to where
they turned she had taken the precaution
of extinguishing the light behind her so
that there would be no shadow cast

  then from where she stood she saw
simpkinss assistant a tall young footman
named albert answer the door and heard
the voice she loved best asking for her
father

    oh god she gasped wondering what
terrible thing had happened to upset his
plans recent fiction she had read supplied
material for her fears had evans discov-
ered her duplicity at the riding academy
and installed a dictograph that had revealed
randys plot was her lover even now
under surveillance with the chance of pos-
sible arrest- for trespassing say-as her
father had threatened robert benham

   she stood like something frozen until in
her darkness she saw albert in the light
bringing randy to the door of the down-
stairs library and ushering him in

   she slipped down after albert had shut
the door but the walls and doors of the
marshall house were thick built to stand
and with the tapestries and the thickness
of the carpets not so much as a confused
murmuring reached her ears

  so she crept away like some hunted
thing that has been trapped at last crept
back to her bedroom and threw herself
face-downward on her bed sobbing piti-
fully she who until then had been in an-
ticipation the happiest girl in the city

  had she heard what was happening she
might have been spared something of her
fears for the man she loved but she had
not forgotten her fathers threat to  do an
injury  to him wrho should come next in
the effort to win his daughters affections

   what happened would have surprised her

  when pierre marshall looked up from
the reports he had been trying to read with-
out his reading-glasses-said glasses have
been unaccountably mislaid and not found
although albert and simpkins had searched
the house and were still searching when
randy rang-when he looked up and saw
her fathers consent



the frank pleasant-faced youth with that
air of keen readiness which he liked to see
in his own young men at the office he very
naturally mistook him for one of them sent
by jenkinson his manager on some busi-
ness or the other

  this belief was partly due to the fact
that he was minus either pair of glasses
having taken off his long-sight ones to read
the reports and partly due to randys air
of brisk alertness and the dispatch case he
carried and which contained the various
 props  for his little melodrama

  it is true pierre marshall did not recog-
nize him but then there were many hun-
dreds of marshall employees whom old
pierre knew neither by sight nor name
and randy had the appearance of the sort
of efficient young business marl the mar-
shall offices favored besides had he not
sent in his name with such assurance and at
such an hour

   here said pierre marshall  youve
come just at the right time cant find my
glasses damn it must have left them at
the office must get some duplicates
read these reports for me

  now  these reports  were the sort of
thing that could only be read by a young
business man who kept close track of just
what the various stocks listed and unlisted
were doing for the name of every stock
was closely abbreviated until the reports
read like cipher and the columns of igures
were not headed in any more understand-
able manner and the figures were further
complicated by abbreviated additions of de-
scriptive phrases

  old pierre did not really expect randy
to be able to read them to him except by
rote he only hoped he could even if he
only read by rote however spelling out the
cipher-like abbreviations that was better
than trying to read them with one eye
closed and the other squinted

  not one young man in fifty in his offices
could have read them but randy being
office manager for a firm whose investments
he was supposed to watch and to counsel
new ones had to read such confidential
nightly reports from the same firm of in-
vestment brokers

  great therefore was pierre marshalls

surprise and gratification when the names
of stocks and the figures quoted denoting
their probable fall or rise in the near fu-
ture as well as the following day quotations
from the bourse capel court and other
foreign exchanges as well as from wall
street plus the probable reasons were all
read off to him as glibly as jenkinson or
his chief financial clerk himself could have
transcribed them

  so glibly indeed were they read that
without realizing what he was doing pierre
marshall asked questions during the read-
ing and got answers whose keen knowledge
of existing financial conditions amazed him
he did randy the honor of making a num-
ber of notes founded on his answers when
the young man had concluded and was fold-
ing the report up pierre marshall rounded
on him suddenly

   why havent i seen you before what
are you doing here to-night anyhow

   i came to tell you that i want to marry
your daughter replied the amazing young
man quite calmly

  pierre marshall fell back in his chair

   wh-what did you say

   i came to tell you i want to marry your
daughter randy repeated quite as calm-
ly although his heart was thumping against
his ribs and his cheeks were flushed and
as i hear youre a great hand at investiga-
ting peoples pasts i want you to have
mine investigated thoroughly before you
give your consent

  old pierre marshall sat limp staring at
him finally he managed to say in what
for him was a small voice

   who the devil are you anyway

   office manager and credit man for
johnson and selkirk inc teas coffees and
spices

   how long you been there

   all my life since i left school never
had any other place uncle of mine got me
a job there when i left college my first year
-couldnt afford to go any longer had to
help bring up the younger ones

   what did you go there as demanded
pierre marshall warming to his work you
might have imagined he was hiring this
amazing young man for a position at mar-
shall  cos


argosy-allstory weekly

  which in a way he was

   office boy responded the other
 promptly  six dollars a week lived on
 it too although it was tough sledding
 however that was over ten years ago and
 six dollars then was the same as ten now
 or more

    started at six huh what you getting
 now

   one seventy-five quite enough to
 marry on i think

   so do i agreed old pierre marshall
 surprisingly but then it was a night of
 surprises  enough to marry the right
 sort of girl of course but-

    i hope you dont mean to intimate that
 your daughter isnt the right sort of girl
 broke in randy flushing  if she marries
 me she does it because she loves me and
 if she loves me she certainly doesnt want
 to injure my self-respect by letting me
 think that what i earn isnt enough to keep
 her comfortable dont you think so

 - pierre marshall eyed him with increas-
 ing respect

    what has she got to say about this
  why what i say naturally responded
 randy and wondered why his father-in-
 law-to-be burst into a loud guffaw  i
 dont see anything to laugh about he add-
 ed in an injured tone

    you would my boy you would if you
 knew that young lady as well as i do i
 think your assurance is marvelous you
 must have her hypnotized didnt she tell
 vou what i promised to do to the next fel-
 low who came around here

     yes she did answered randy flush-
 ing  and i dont blame you cither con-
 sidering the sort youve had to put up with

 i	want to thank you for protecting her
 shes only a kid and its natural a girl
 should have some man hanging around
 she isnt like a man-she cant go places
 by herself has to have some man take her
 you know and even if she isnt in love
 you see whats more natural than that she
 should let men come to see her in exchange
 for them taking her places

     but she wasnt in love with any of
  them she didnt want to marry them
  she does want to marry me and i havent
  even any social position to give her let

alone any money-except what i make-
or any luxury she knows i wouldnt take

anything from you because i told her so

   why demanded pierre marshall in-
terested despite himself

    because i want her to realize its co-
rinne i want not your money i fell in
love with her before i knew who she was
you see and-

   the story of their meeting and the sub-
sequent happenings sprang to his lips and
was out before he realized it

   so there the matter stands randy
concluded  and its only fair to warn you
sir that if you refuse your consent we shall
manage somehow to marry without it

  he had carefully omitted any mention
of the proposed elopement old man mar-
shall had had his chance randy figured
and if he remained obdurate the elopement
should go forward as originally planned
it was entirely up to her father whether
he gave his consent or not

  what has she to say about that

 what i say of-i say mr marshall
i wish you wouldnt laugh at me like that
for the second time that night pierre
marshall had burst into one of his guffaws

   i havent enjoyed myself so much in
years quoth he wiping the tears from his
eyes  wait here a moment if she hasnt
gone to bed ill call her down

  the soft carpet gave no warning of his
approach and he found his daughter face
downward on the bed her pillow wet with
her tears he looked down at the little
crumpled figure and a tender look crept into
his eyes

    well daughter he said and gathered
her into his arms  do you want some-
thing so terribly bad as all that youre
not the crying kind honey i know that
come tell your old daddy and hell try to
get it for you

   i-i want randy she sobbed and
buried her tear-stained face on his shoul-
der  oh father i want randy so much
and hes so sweet you couldnt help but
love him if you knew him i didnt care
about the others daddy and im glad you
did what you did but randys-different
i cant live without randy daddy dont
take him awav from me please

                          	a
her fathers consent



  a small trembly hand crept upward to
pat his face patted it timidly all just as
it had been when pierre marshall was a
newly made widower alone with his baby
girl nearly nineteen years ago

  the remembrance of that motherless in-
fant who had patted his face timidly be-
cause he sobbed brought the moisture to
his eyes again-probably for the first time
since then too and so he caught the little
soft hand and held it against his bristly
cheek exactly as he had done so long ago
and his voice was choked when he tried to
put his emotion into words

   why pussikins i-i-i didnt come
up here to take him away from you i
came up here to give him to you-

  at her cry of joy he held up one hand
  and tried to revert to his old gruff self

     on one condition mind that you
  dont leave this house think im going to
  keep up a house just for myself wasting
  money like that no sir you tell that
  young man if he wants you hell have to
  live here where i can keep my eye on him
  and know he treats you right-

     only half of the foregoing was coherent
   so smothered was it by her hold about his

 neck and the kisses that continually im-
 peded his utterance then without giving
 him time to recover she sped off down-
 stairs

    oh randy randy father is such a
 dear she cried rapturously  it was so
 sweet of you to think of him i love you
 twice as much for it darling-

   she would have thrown herself into his
 arms but for a reason she did not at first
 understand he was holding her off albeit
 tenderly and with the utmost gentleness

   following the direction of his eyes she
 saw that her father had followed her down-
 stairs a dazed and bewildered look in his
 face he was wondering i suppose how
  it had all happened so suddenly yet withal
 with his consent

 then randolph beatty put the finishing
 touch on his amazingness in pierre mar-
 shalls own house in his very own library
 his own private sanctum that astounding
 young mein put an arm about pierre mar-
 shalls own daughter and gave a significant
 glance toward the open door

      if youll pardon us sir for just a few
    moments-with your kind permission of
    course-i-that is-wed like to be alone

what has occurred in part 

the rev bruce de lisle and his friend andrew bailey in payment of a past debt to chink-
nail connors owner of the cracker pot cafe on the old bowery of new york city agree to
take over its management while connors makes a trip to boston connors fears a raid on
the part of sailors from captain jakes crew with whom he is involved in a mysterious enterprise
and who has hidden part of his cargo in the cellar of the cafe connors also distrusts his bar-
tender emile and joie the jug an habitue

     connors sinisterly vanishes and bruce has just taken over charge of the cafe when a girl
obviously playing a part and in league with a negro piano player eddie carbon enters shortly
afterward a mob of sailors crash open the door of the cracker pot and rush in

chapter vi

captain jakes cargo

on they came a motley crew of
heavy-faced ruffians the scum and
dregs from the worst resorts on the
river front they swarmed into the
cracker pot like human buzzards and their
clamorings gave evidence of die mob spirit
that possessed them

  with the momentum derived from num-
bers they swept into the little back room
overturning everytning in their path

this ttory began in the argoty

  glasses tumbled to the floor and the crack
  of splintering wood accompanied the crash
  as table legs were wrenched loose that they
  might serve as convenient clubs in the
  melee that was to follow

    the small group in front of the platform
  reflected the confusion and uncertainty at-
  tendant upon the unexpected onslaught
  bruce had jumped to his feet dimly con-
  scious of a subtle energizing force that was
  sweeping through his blood he was also
  conscious of the fact that the young woman
  had pressed close to him in her terror her

crafty rogues



  hand was clutching his arm he could feel
  the vibrating tremors of fear that were pul-
  sating through her body

    it might have been the peculiar calmness
  of his mind or the very nearness of the
  frightened girl that caused him to study her
  face at any rate his quick searching
  glance was a revelation the mask of
  bravado was gone the primitive instincts
  -the registered imprint of quality and
  blood-had taken its place she was no
  longer playing a part underneath the
  drawn distress of that face bruce traced the
  lines of refinement and culture

    bailey was also on his feet and glanced
  with apprehension at his friend if he ex-
  pected to find fear written across the face
  of bruce de lisle he was mistaken in
  the midst of danger a cowardly man seldom
  smiles and bruces face bore the impress of
  a sardonic grin-the smile of a man who
  is gripping both nerve and muscle for per-
  fect phy sical control

   he drew near to bailey and his words
 sounded as though they were being ripped
 out with a cross-cut saw

     there is a hell bailey said he  and
  this is it

    the next instant he was out of his coat
  and had thrown it on the platform he
  also mounted the first step leading to it at
  the entrance to the dance hall the mob
  paused until their leader worked his way to
  the front

   he was none other than the juggling
 sailor

   bruce noted the great hulking form of
 the man the broad nose that had evidently
 cushioned many a stinging blow the cauli-
 flowered right ear that had been beaten to a
 pulp in some fistic encounter he was an
 antagonist of no mean powers to say noth-
 ing of his brutal followers

  step down he shouted to bruce

 step down before we beats out your
senses

 the shuffling crowd now quiet except
for their suppressed blusterings had drawn
nearer but neither bruce nor bailey had
moved an inch

  what do you mean when we gives you
a chance to save your skins listen-we
are here to pull the vitals out of this moldy

crib to rip out its innards and like honest
men we gives you a chance to get out
here he turned to the waiting men behind
him  gangway lads-so the pretty boys
can run outside and get the air stand
aside

  with prompt obedience they stepped to
the right and left leaving a broad passage
through which bruce and his friend might
have made their exit had they been so
minded

  bruce had quietly stepped down and was
leaning on one of the dance-hall chairs the
confident boisterous sailor was within three
feet of him

    are you through   he asked with quiet
sarcasm

   ah ha he sasses his betters he
does  exclaimed the sailor  but i hates
the sight of blood so well listen to his
talk but i warns you jerk it out quick
little bright eyes

   save both your time and your breath
we are not going was bruces reply  not
going-do you get it this place is under
our protection we stand for law and order
against you and your evil designs this
lady however will oblige both of us by
leaving at once

   bruce turned to the terror-stricken young
woman at his side

    go he commanded  for if i mistake
not this will be no place for you

   hold deary leered the big sailor-
 not so fast we be jolly lads and would
bespeak your company

  he had drawn near to her his reeking
breath and odious features brought an ago-
nizing appeal from the girl as she turned
toward bruce

  it was a fatal moment for the ogling
monster for his stupidity prompted him to
temporize with fate he deliberately slipped
his arm about her waist

  then something happened

   bruce swung the chair over his head and
the hardwood seat caught the burly sailor
straight on the forehead it was like the
crack of a mallet and was accompanied by
an almost delirious groan as the big fellow
sagged to the floor

  instantly the cracker pot assumed all
the dramatic realities that are supposed to


arcosy-allstory weekly

exist within the classical hall of pandemo-
nium the full quota of demons and evil
spirits were surely in evidence at least
twenty brawny men were ready to avenge
the violence that had been shown their lead-
er and they swarmed to his rescue

   prudence seldoms loiters in the footsteps
of folly and baileys line of action follow-
ing bruces initiative was never dictated
by reason he made straight for the on-
coming horde of frenzied villains as a
tennis player he knew the value of a sweep-
ing stroke whether behind racket or fist
and his first blow had naught of the short
arm play it was a vicious staggering
drive straight into the sodden face before
him-the first one he could find had it
missed he would have lost his footing by
the momentum of the stroke

   by instinct-for he had no time for ob-
servation-bailey knew that bruce was
fighting like a demon and he was his
splendid physique was behind the hammer-
like blows he was railing upon his assail-
ants the best that connors had taught
him of feint and guard all came back like
a bit of a half-forgotten poem the lines re-
turned

   behind bruce was a little alley that led to
the rear of the platform and here the young
woman had taken refuge this small pas-
sageway was free except for a pile of chairs
stacked against the wall

  between bruce and the side wall was
one of the round serving tables there was
one near bailey also they were about to
play an important part in their plan of
defense as neither bruce nor bailey were
supermen courage alone was not sufficient
to resist the forces against them beaten
to his knees bailey had only saved him-
self by grasping the near-by table and
struggling to his feet the friendly alley
was at his left and he realized that only a
strategical retreat would save the critical
moment

   gripping the table with his left hand he
managed to keep it in front of him as he
began the task of consolidating the fighting
line his object being to gain the mutual
advantage of fighting behind an improvised
barricade

   instantly bruce saw the value of the

move and overturned the table in front of
him

  they now stood behind a barrier that
offered no great amount of protection un-
less they could keep the opposing forces
away from them and to the credit of the
young woman she solved the problem
temporarily at least

    here she shouted  catch it

  she tossed one of the chairs to bruce
then another one to bailey but even this
mode of defense was to avail for the mo-
ment only gradually they were being
forced back to the platform it seemed a
miracle that they were not crushed by the
very force of numbers

   a particularly insistent ruffian had forced
his way between the tables and drove bruce
to the platform steps but his very position
made him a target for their combined ef-
forts bottles glasses and to bruces hor-
ror an occasional shot began to whiz by
then a chair loomed up in front of him
and one of the wooden legs caught him full
in the forehead

  he knew that his fight was over blood
trickled across his face and the room black-
ened before him he staggered against the
piano

   perhaps it was his prominent position as
he stood above them and the knowledge of
victory that caused a respite in the fight-
ing at any rate there was a pause in
which the sound of splintering wood was
heard

  it came from behind the platform where
the trapdoor had buckled as if it had been
a piece of wet cardboard

  bruce turned and the strange thing he
saw revived him as no medicinal restorative
could have done a monstrous black hand
had shot up through the splintered center
it was accompanied by a growl that resem-
bled the muttering thunders of a distant
storm

  as he gazed in dismay the hinges broke
from the floor and the woolly head of a
giant negress appeared at the opening-a
head that to bruce resembled a huge black
kettle

  bruce gasped at her size as she emerged
like one from the pit in girth she sug-
gested the size of an ale cask while her
crafty 

n

 height was not less than six feet three
 inches clad in a loose calico wtapper
 bound at the waist her body was a moun-
 tain of billowy flesh

   frightful as she was bruces aesthetic
 sensibilities were to receive a still greater
 shock for directly behind her crawled an
 enormous gorilla

   it was by no means an opportune mo-
 ment for speculation but in spite of his
 dazed mind bruce wondered could this be
 any part of the mysterious cargo that cap-
 tain jake had brought from south africa
 surely they were indigenous to the soil

   graver thoughts now began to assail him
 had this savage pair of african giants
 emerged to augment the hostile forces they
 were now contending with or were they
 merely bent upon escape from confinement

 he moved to the right of the platform to
   await the issue

     together they climbed up through the
   opening and now stood on the platform-
   their bodies swaying in unison as if they
   would catch the harmony of the riotous
   melee before them

     the negress was muttering an unintelligi-
   ble jargon-a gibbering of harsh conso-
   nants-and to the surprise of bruce the
   big beast at her side seemed to understand
   from his elevated position bruce now com-
   prehended why they had thus far been able
   to hold out against superior numbers f
   when their leader had fallen at least a
   dozen of his band had dragged him to the
   rear of the hall where they were adminis-
   tering copious drafts of the one form of res-
   torative they were familiar with-brandy

       under their splendid administration of
     alcoholic first aid he had regained his
     senses at the moment the negress mounted
     the platform then his eyes seemed to pop
     from their blood - stained sockets he
     strained forward and a gloating grin
     spread over his coarse features his voice
     grew husky with anxiety as he shouted in-
     structions for her capture

       having in a measure regained possession
     of both mind and strength bruce glanced
     at the young woman and was astonished to
     find that she was also regarding the negress
     with an expression of keen satisfaction a
     peculiar relaxation of mind was reflected

rogues	

  in her face as if some grave doubt ox
  problem had been setded

    in response to their leaders urging two
  more courageous than their companions
  leaped forward to obey his commands the
  negress waited their coming her great
  hands were twitching convulsively and she
  handled herself with a speed that was in
  marvelous contrast to her size

    with utter scorn for all things feminine
  the confident sailors were about to scale
  the platform steps and gain their objective
  by the very fierceness of their assault but
  their overconfidence proved their undoing
  their grinning faces gave way to terror

    the negress had stepped down to meet
  them her deft black hands had grasped
  their necks as easily as if they had been
  toy manikins and their heads came to-
  gether with a smash bruce likened it to
  the snapping of a brazillian walnut as it
  surrenders in the jaws of a cracker

     the hideous brute at her side now com-
    menced to indulge in his own peculiar form
    of jungle calisthenics he was of the spe-
    cies known as the troglodytes gorilla or
    great chimpanzee of east africa and like
    his kind when aroused had assumed an
    upright position and was beating his breast
    with his huge fists it was like the vibra-
    tions of a great drum

     his clumsy antics were accompanied by
    a deep rumbling bark that swelled into a
    roar of rage even in his crouching posi-
    tion the animal was taller than the negress
    and his great hairy chest loomed up like the
    form of an ox

     the supporting members of the brawny
    sailors who wtould capture the negress had
    stopped when they saw what manner of
    punishment had been meted to their com-
    rades there were three of them but they
    had sadly underestimated the reach of those
    awful arms with incredible swiftness the
    gorilla had shot his steel-like claws straight
    against the chest of the foremost man to
    bruces astonished eyes it had been with-
    out effort but the effect was horrible there
    was a crackling that resembled the crushing
    of an eggshell as his body collapsed then
    the long sinewy fingers touched a face and
    to bruces dismay it was like a face that
    had disappeared

   the gorilla was now on the floor dancing
 with the grace of a drunken bull  one
 moment he would be on all fours the next
 he would erect himself and sway with a
 ponderous grace that was almost hyp-
 notic

   bruce never knew whether it was due
to a signal from the negress or the prompt-
ings of brute cunning but upon one of the
gorillas downward swings he suddenly
lurched forward and grasped one of the
more adventurous ruffians by the ankle it
might have been purely imagination but
bruce thought he traced the flicker of a
hellish grin as the brute arose and the dull
thud of the mans head was heard against
the floor

   the inconceivable reach of that simian
arm was then in evidence in ever-widen-
ing circles the victim was being swung over
his head until the frenzied beast finally
let go

   then as if released from a catapult the
 human battering-ram shot through the air
 like some inanimate object over the heads
 of the breathless spectators a distance of
 some fifteen feet where it dropped to the
 floor near the table at which the juggling
 sailor had been seated

   that he might the better direct his fol-
 lowers he had climbed to the table top and
 was mouthing the most sulphuric curses he
 could command

   as the body of the sailor rolled against
 the legs of the table he unsheathed the
 long-bladed knife at his belt and a second
 later it left his hand-a flash of light
 through the room-and plunged into the
 right shoulder of the gorilla

   the great brute did not seem to notice
it not so however with the negress had
the deadly blade been driven into her own
black body she could not have uttered a
more pitiful cry

   quickly she withdrew the knife from the
 tangled knot of muscles in which it was
 embedded and with splendid aim sent it
 whirling back to the astonished sailor it
 cut the air with a hiss and the group sur-
 rounding the leaders table dodged right
 and left as it struck and quivered in the wall
 behind them

   beyond any doubt the critical moment

had arrived the big negress had evidently
surrendered-at least in spirit for the mo-
ment-and if the hardy crew of villains
intended to effect her capture they knew
that their time had arrived

  the gorilla had introduced a new form
of frollicking playfulness if such it was
he had a peculiar trick of slapping his
paws against the floor and the negress saw
it whatever train of african thought it
aroused in her one thing was certain-she
lavished a glance of crude affection upon
the great hairy brute and then faced the
mob that was sweeping toward the plat-
form

  once more the spirit of battle waged
within her and what followed was in reality
the supreme incident in a night of riot and
blood

  a word from the negress-that was all-
and the gorilla had leaped to the platform
and was at her side true it might have
been the herculean strength of the giantess
alone that was responsible for the success
of her plan but the gorilla certainly gave
of his clumsy strength for between them
they had tipped up the old-fashioned square
piano and shoved it or hurled it straight
into the crowrd of sailors beneath them

   there wras an awful moment of crash and
curses a period of indescribable confusion
during which the juggling sailor had secured
another long-bladed knife from one of his
companions it twirled above his head for
a moment then left his hand a glint of
murderous steel and plunged to the hilt in
the throat of the gorilla

    this way quick shouted a voice be-
hind bruce

  it was joie the jug and his head and
shoulders were protruding from the trap-
door opening

chapter vii

down in the pit

amid the surroundings the call was like
an invitation to plunge into a cavity
of hell-a message from satans own
emissary-and the croaking tones in which
it was uttered by joie but emphasized this
comparison
crafty

   bruce realized that something must be
done quick action was imperative the
mass of squirming humans underneath the
piano were being pulled out like worms
from a clod of earth all that had gone
before was peace to the din that now
reigned bruce wondered that the horrible
roar did not split the very walls of the
room

   the power to act seemed to have left
him like one completely dazed he waited
for some impelling force that would drive
him to action

   tt came there was a crash at the street
 door-a battering in of the panels the
 breaking of glass and finally the flash of a
 locust club followed by a bluecoated arm
 some one had turned in a riot call and
 the police were tumbling through the door
 it was the one thing that connors had al-
 ways dreaded

   next to the shooting up of the cracker
 pot by the marauding sailors it was the
 most to be feared bruce knew this and
 faced the issue how far did his respon-
 sibility to connors go had he reached
 the limit his mind began to assemble the
 scattered jackstraws of his game

   one grave danger at least was over
the sailors were no longer intent upon the
capture of the negress their traditional
enemy had put in an appearance and they
were being clubbed into submission

   bruce stepped nearer to the excited joie

   what is it he shouted

   come quick-all of you i know the
way out  he answered

   peering down into the opening bruce
saw by the dim light of a lantern that
some one was standing below joie at the
foot of the ladder

   it was eddie carbon and his face had
taken on the peculiar ashen hue that goes
with a frightened negro bruce instantly
grasped the situation just before the en-
trance of the sailors carbon had passed
through the dance hall on his way to the
j-treet and had not returned therefore
to have reached the underground room he
must have done so by an outside passage

   another revelation followed this man
joie had known the place in the days be-
fore connors made it respectable and in

rogues	

 all probability was familiar with the dark
 and devious exits through which the gam-
 bling gentry effected their escape it was
 reasonable to assume that he had made use
 of them

  now came the question of giving up or
sticking of seeing it through or quitting
bailey was equally quick to appreciate the
importance of the decision he moved nea-
er to bruce

   its fifty-fifty he shouted  but ill
go you come on-it cant be any worse
than this

  the negress had given up moaning over
the dead gorilla and was climbing down
the ladder her grief was pathetic

   im game was bruces response mov-
ing toward the opening

  then he stopped the young woman was
crowding down ahead of him in the ex-
citement he had forgotten her so far as
personal violence was concerned her danger
was past but there was no valid reason
why she should subject herself to the un-
certainties of what might follow unless she
also knew that this was a road to safety
there was only one other sound excuse for
permitting her apparent folly-she might
have splendid reasons for wishing to avoid
the police

  it took but a moment for these reflec-
tions to sweep through bruces mind but
even so-the opportunity to restrain her
had passed

  she was at the foot of the ladder

  bailey and bruce quickly followed and
down they went-all of them-into the
stone chamber which was supposed to har-
bor the valuable cargo which captain jake
had sailed the seven seas to garner

  bruce hurriedly took in his surroundings
the room was about fifteen by fifteen a
pile of straw in one corner a heap of bones
in another a broken stool some filthy
blankets and a queer-looking box that re-
sembled a chinese tea chest except that
it was smaller and considerably stronger
the lid was off showing its use as a re-
ceptacle for food as evidenced by a loaf
of bread and several tins of canned goods

  there was no valued treasure here-
neither sack keg nor packet that might
contain strange wares or merchandise noth-

ing but filth and an atmosphere that was
registering its moldy protest upon the sur-
rounding walls

   what did it all mean that was the
question now uppermpst in bruces mind
was it possible that a giant negress and
her horrible gorilla were the sole results of
that congo voyage was there some crude
hoax behind it all

   jpie had pulled the door down over the
 opening and shot the bolts which locked
 it as best he could into the broken sock-
 ets occasionally they heard the tread of a
 rough-shod foot on the floor above them
 but it was quite evident that the fighting
 was over subdued voices came from the
 front of the building where the police were
 probably lining up their prisoners

   having appraised the dimensions of the
 room and taken in the meager details bruce
 was conscious of a sudden fear that had
 come upon him where was the opening
 through which they were to pass noth-
 ing but solid walls confronted them he
 reached for joie and roughly whirled him
 about so the light would strike his face

    the way out he questioned  where
 is it

   here was the answer as he moved
over to the corner and scraped away the
straw revealing a door similar to the one
above them

   after lifting it bruce took the lantern
 and lowered it into the black hole beneath
 him his conclusion was that the cavern-
 like vault was a section of some abandoned
 sewer in the distance he could hear the
 drip of water this and the curved brick
 sides reeking with moisture confirmed his
 opinion that their exit was tobe via some
 ancient sewerage system

   joie was at his elbow

   wait he said  let me show you-
 i know the way you stood by me this af-
 ternoon and i want to make good honest
 -ill get you out

   bruce looked at bailey

    its another fifty-fifty he replied
  try it

   the confidence shown by joie as he slid
 down into the passage reassured bruce

   next he called	

   eddie carbon pushed the negress for-

 ward but bailey realizing that it might
 be difficult for her to make it without as-
 sistance preceded her it was well he did
 as she could scarcely squeeze through

   bruce eddie carbon and the young
woman were still in the square stone room
and to bruces surprise his companions
were lingering behind he turned to dis-
cover that they were searching among the
rubbish in the opposite corner pawing over
a heap of refuse and bones he could hear
them whispering

    what are you doing there he sharply
 questioned

    hunting for a candle end replied the
 negro  we may need it

   the answer was so ready and the idea so
 sensible that bruce felt ashamed of the
 curt tones he had employed in addressing
 them

   a moment later they were all in the
 vaulted passage eddie carbon being the
 last to slip through bruce meanwhile
 watching to be sure that he closed the door
 behind him

   the atmosphere was as heavy as lead
 it was fetid and sour withal there was a
 gripping chill that penetrated to their very
 marrow it was suggestive of the tomb
 where every breath was laden with pesti-
 lence and death

   beneath their feet there was a treacher-
 ous slime and they found it difficult to re-
 tain their footing

   bruce began heartily to question the wis-
 dom of having relied upon the leadership of
 one so dull and sodden as joie but had
 some confidence in carbons ability to con-
 duct them to safety he also knew that
 if it was necessary they could at least re-
 turn to the cracker pot by way of the stone
 chamber above them

   the grain of comfort conferred by this
 thought was destined never to hear fruitage
 for an incident followed that brought bruce
 face to face with the horrors of their posi-
 tion

   carbon had pulled the door to position
 but continued to fuss with the catch or bolt
 -bruce did not know which

    what are you doing he asked

    locking it came the answer

    what with
crafty rogues	

   a big padlock answered the negro

   give me the key commanded bruce

   sure responded the negro jumping
down from the short ladder

  whether by intent or accident-he fell
as his feet touched the slimy ooze his
hand was outstretched to pass the key to
bruce and there was no evidence of un-
willingness on his part to surrender it but
almost before he landed there was an ex-
clamation of fright from him  my gor-
i done drop de key 

  his shrill-pitched tones echoed through
the vaulted space and far in the distance
they heard the mocking repetition of
 key as if some jeering spirit had gloated
over their danger

  for about ten seconds bruces heart ac-
tion failed him a clammy sweat broke
across his forehead to find anything in
that mass of mud and mire would border on
the miraculous

   bring de lantern man cause i got my
hand right on de place where it done sink
in 

  to bruces mind there was something
mechanical about the negros announce-
ment-a ready-made resourcefulness that
bordered on the theatric hence his first
move was to examine the padlock which he
found to be securely fastened he then
flashed his light on the spot where the negro
was stripping his fingers through the slime
in ever-widening circles his black hands
were clawing the soft mass

   come on-come on-show yself mis-
tah key jump into mah hands-come
on the negro crooned

  they all waited breathlessly for the re-
sult

  as bruce watched eddie carbon he also
scrutinized every move and expression of
joies his face was nervously twitching
and he would gaze with uncertainty-first
to the right then to the left once more
a thrill of terror swept through bruce for
the moment he was panic-stricken sup-
pose by any chance there were passages
that intersected with the one they were in-
would the lethargic brain of joie succumb to
compjete bewilderment

  between a negro of whom he was suspi-
cious and a weakling who could not be de-

pended upon bruce had no choice stand-
ing over eddie carbon he was in a posi-
tion to glance beyond him for a distance of
several feet what he saw give him instant
courage

  there were footprints plainly defined
they had not been made by any one belong-
ing to bruces party-he knew that in
fact they were the tracks of one person
and they led away from the place they were
now standing the imprint was stale and
there was no evidence that the individual
had returned

  it was like a message from the occult
if joie and carbon had entered the cracker
pot through this underground passage he
could trace the direction from which they
came

   no use-no use at all boss mah luck
done turned against me said the negro
arising

  without deigning to reply bruce took
the lantern and advanced a short distance
in the opposite direction-toward the river
then he suppressed an exclamation of satis-
faction

  the footprints of two men were plainly
seen tracks led to the point where they
had entered the passage from the stone
chamber

  it seemed useless to waste further val-
uable time bruce turned to joie

   which way he asked

   to the left answered joie taking the
lead in what bruce knew was the wrong di-
rection

  bailey who had sensed the situation now
touched bruce on the arm as a signal to
draw aside

   do you think he will make it he
asked

   no-he has started wrong i am al-
lowing him to do so because i want to test
the negro the black rascal knows that the
start is wrong and i do not think he intends
to correct him

  they had gone about fifteen feet when
joie halted

   im wrong he advised  we should
have gone the other way

  bruce waited in vain for the negro to
express an opinion-to confirm or deny
joies statement two or three minutes


argosy-allstory weekly

went by all the negro did was stupidly to
scratch his head not a word from him

   it was a gruesome wait the insistent
drip drip of water in a near-by pool could
be heard and just behind him bruce
caught the sound of a swift-scurrying water
rat instinctively he glanced at the young
woman-she was the one member of the
group who should have been alarmed over
the situation unless she had confidence in
the negro

  when bruce finally spoke his words
jumped out with an almost metallic snap
 listen carbon-ill give you just one
chance to come to life act and act quick
because i am holding myself back right
now

    keep your hands off me man-put em
in your pockets-cause im go in to find
myself yes sir-we gotta go back

   in single file they now moved toward the
 river and had traveled about one hundred
 feet when bruce discovered that the brick
 pavement under their feet was comparative-
 ly clean the sediment had been deposited
 in the low places only-therefore his check
 on the negro was gone once more bruce
 became apprehensive what now

   another fifteen feet and eddie carbon
halted bruce hurried forward and isaw
that a pile of bricks partially blocked their
way at some time in the past a section of
the roof had fallen

   to crawl pver them involved no danger
and would not be difficult for any of them
unless it was the negress nevertheless
bruce decided to investigate first if he
found a bed of untracked mud on the other
side of the obstruction it would signify that
the negro had led them past the exit bruce
was so anxious to find with this in mind
he rather welcomed the blocked passage as
he would use it as an excuse to proceed
alone it gave him a chance to take his
bearings

   upon second thought it seemed wise to
request bailey to accompany him which
he did

   stay where you are he commanded
the others we will be right back

   scarcely twenty-five feet beyond tfce fall-
 en bricks they found the friendly trail lead-
 ing on through the soft mud

    fine exclaimed bruce  we are on
our way-it is all right

   they had turned to retrace their steps
when both realized that something was
wrong among those left behind had it not
been for the intervening pile of rubbish
their light might have revealed what was
taking place as it was they heard the
voice of the negro then a quavering note of
protest from joie after that the muffled
sound of a blow

    its the negro said bailey as they
made for the pile of bricks  hes crook-
ed bruce

   well see when we get on the other
side-just now i am thinking about the
woman come on-we will be over in a
minute

   they were scrambling through the open-
ing between the top of the bricks and the
roof with bruce in the lead he was
straining to catch the first glimpse of what
had taken place

   in his hurry he stumbled the next in-
stant they were in total darkness in fall-
ing bruce had dropped his lantern and the
jar extinguished the light

    quick-a match he called to bailey

   it seemed an eternity before bailey an-
swered bruce could hear him searching
through his pockets at last he spoke

   not a match-this is awful bruce-
not a single blessed match 

chapter viii

in again out again

jeep your nerve advised bruce
        and try again

          a painful silence followed a
tense moment of horrible suspense  no
use he finally whispered  how about
your own pockets-have you been through
them

    every one

   both men fully appreciated the gravity
of their situation not a sound reached
them the silence was almost unbearable
and worst of all was the thought that they
had been deserted by those whom they had
left behind unless something worse had oc-
curred
crafty rogues



   they were engulfed not only in silence
but utter darkness if they moved toward
the river they had no means of determin-
ing when they came to the opening which
had admitted joie and the negro  then
again if they were able to feel along the
roof and locate the entrance to the stone
chamber it would serve no purpose be-
cause it was looked

   to remain inactive just now is to gam-
ble with our reason said bruce  move
up so you can grasp my arm-we will feel
our way along until we come to the muddy
part of the passage and then determine on
some line of action

   once more they experienced the horrors
of silence instinctively they were voicing
their thoughts in hoarse whispers as mind
and nerves battled for something tangible
groping their way in the darkness bruce
suddenly halted and his grip on bailey
tightened

   dont move was his hoarse com-
mand  my foot is touching something-

a body i think

   then he leaned down to investigate

 give me your hand he added a second
later  there-what do you make out
of it

    you are right said bailey  it is a
man

    in that case it would have to be eidier
joie or the negro heavens if we only
had a light

    never mind the light i will tell you
which one it is replied bailey

    how

    if it is joie there will be a bandage on
his head

    right responded bruce  i put it
there this afternoon following the barten-
ders brutal assault

    its joie announced bailey  the
   head is bandaged

   then he gave an exclamation of delight
    what is it asked bruce

   bailey failed to offer a prompt reply
   bruce could hear him fumbling in the
   darkness he was about to repeat his
   question when the most joyous sound he
   had ever heard greeted him it was the
   scrape of a match against the side of a
   box

   thank the lord was the reverent ex-
pression of both men

   i found them in his vest pocket said
bailey

  as the flame jumped from the burning
match to the eager wick of the lantern both
men clasped hands then they hugged each
other even as two emotional women might
have done

   at their feet lay the limp body of joie

   stunned-thats all said bailey bend-
ing over him

   they evidently use him down here as
a human punching bag was bruce com-
ment  see how considerate the negro has
been to hit him on the same spot that the
bartender used maybe it is part of their
game to gamble on how far they can boost
him into eternity without shoving him over
the line

  lifting the battered wreck of a man into
a sitting position they were gratified to see
him slowly open his eyes

   what happened asked bailey

   eddie carbon hit me mumbled joie

   what for asked bruce

   i dunno was the answer

   come said bailey we are wasting
valuable time lend a hand bruce-we
will get him on his feet perhaps they will
serve us better than his brains

  with profound satisfaction they discov-
ered that their patient could walk although
his progress was painfully slow

   one thing puzzles me said bailey
 i fail to understand how the negro made
his escape in the dark

   he was not in the dark was bruces
comment  the last thing he did before
leaving was to skirmish for a few candle
ends all of which proves that he was laying
his plans to desert us

   how about the woman-do you think
she is working with the negro or have cir-
cumstances conspired against her

   i wish i could tell you was bruces
reply to me she represents the biggest
mystery we have so far encountered when
eddie carbon passed through the cracker
pot to-night i scrutinized her face closely
and was positive that she had never seen
him before later when i caught them
whispering i changed my mind


argosy-allstory weekly

   by this time they had reached the en-
trance to the stone chamber the door was
just above their heads

   well what do you think of that ex-
claimed bruce  so help me bob-it is
open

    right commented bailey in low tones
  and unless i am mistaken here is the big
 padlock this way with your light-its in
 the mud i just stepped on it

   not so loud take it easy warned
bruce  they may be waiting for us to
poke our heads up through the opening

    never replied bailey  they are not
 up in that room the jumbo negress could
 not make it she travels in one piece in
 sections she might have made it but in
 one chunk-no i tell you she busted her
 waist line coming down didnt i help
 her

    that as it may said bruce  im
going to find out stay where you are for
a moment

   thrusting his lantern ahead of him bruce
 cautiously climbed into the room they had
 so recently fled from bailey was right
 eddie carbon and his companions had not
 made their escape in this direction the
 bolts on the shattered trapdoor leading up
 into connorss dance hall had not been
 touched

    what do you find asked bailey from
below

    not a thing the room is empty

    then it ought to make a nice little bed-
 room for this cripple cant we plant him
 on that pile of straw in the corner

    a good suggestion-boost him up
 together they hoisted joie into the room
 after which bailey climbed to bruces side
 both men were grappling with the same
 problem what motive had influenced the
 negro why had he opened the door after
 taking such pains to convince them that the
 key was lost what was his purpose in
 risking all by stopping long enough to
 unlock a door he had no intention of using
 surely it was not because of kindly intent
 just to allow bruce and bailey an avenue of
 escape

    for a liar that negro is the finished
 product bruce finally remarked  think
 of his acting he may be a knave but he

 is no fool could anything have been more
 artful than the way he clawed in the mud
 for a key that was probably in his pocket all

the time

   bailey who had been giving close atten-
tion to the sordid details of the stone cham-
ber suddenly turned to bruce

    you can pin my medal right here he
said tapping his chest

    a medal for what asked bruce

   for being the star sleuth hound i
know why the negro opened this door

    why asked bruce all attention

    to sneak up and get the funny little
chest its gone

   baileys simple deduction required obser-
vation only to confirm it

   the strange-looking box had vanished
during bruces earlier inspection of the
room his attention had been cunningly di-
verted from the box by its apparent use as
a receptacle for food in all probability
a shallow tray had been fitted into the top
of the chest for the purpose of misleading
any one who might become curious the
open lid had likewise served to disarm sus-
picion

    once more the interest quickens said
bruce  what do you imagine was in the
blooming chest

    dont ask me replied bailey  im
a sleuth-not a fortune teller furthermore

i	think we should forget for the moment
at least the chest and its contents as a
graver matter is up for decision

    all right chief-im listening

    in the first place began bailey  grim
disaster has flirted with us ever since we
set foot in the cracker pot everything
we promised to look after has disappeared
or been wrecked right in front of our eyes
connors-eddie carbon-the negress and
the mysterious young woman-all have
vanished besides that the sailors have
riddled the cracker pot and the jwlice have
closed it up for good now what i want
to know is this shall we climb back into
the dance hall and wash our hands of the
entire mess or slide into the sewer and hunt
for the negro

   the lines of bruces mouth tightened and
a bit of the bulldog flashed from his eyes
he moved toward the opening
crafty rogues	

   ill take the sewer he snapped

  after making joie as comfortable as pos-
sible under the circumstances they once
more entered the evil-smelling passageway
beneath them

  upon this occasion there was one thing in
their favor-they were sure of their direc-
tion it was toward the west and away
from the river

  they soon reached the point where bruce
had discovered the stale footprints of the
person who had walked in the direction the
were now pursuing here they found new
tracks-the plain trail made by eddie car-
bon and his companions especially notice-
able was the broad tread of the negress

  following this plainly defined path they
traversed a distance equal to the length of
a citv block here it suddenly stopped
there was a jumbled mass of footprints
beyond which the soft mud was trackless
there was also a jagged hole in the bricks
at the left side of the passage into this a
door had been roughly fitted it might have
withstood the combined efforts of a dozen
men when first placed there but now it
was crumbling with age in fact as bruce
touched it a handful of rotting shreds crum-
bled to powder

   after all you cant help but admire the
negros cleverness said bruce

   in what respect questioned bailey

   why he was moving in the right direc-
tion when i stopped him and insisted upon
going the other way

   by george you are right what do
you make of it

   simply this-there are two entrances to
this passageway either one was at the
command of the gambling fraternity at the
time they were using the cracker pot for
crooked games one east toward the river
and this one west of their point of entry

   i follow you somewhere beyond the
pile of bricks we climbed over there is an-
other way out
i- think so the negro had no special
plans beyond locking the door behind him
he was ready to accept conditions as he
found them and await his chance

   well-he got it said bailey

   he certainly did replied bruce  but
chirk up we are about to rope him

   why this burst of confidence asked
bailey

   because he cannot go very far with
that colored dame he has with him she
isnt built for speed besides that her last
ounce of energy went into the fight she
made on your guard now bailey my
personal opinion is that they are not far
away

  bracing their shoulders against the door
the decayed timber split into fragments
and the shattered sections dropped to their
feet almost without a sound

   thats good said bruce  the less
noise we make the better

  then they stepped through the opening
they were in the cellar or subcellar of some
abandoned warehouse the flagstone pave-
ment was grooved and rutted by the steel-
hooped chimes of many an ancient cask and
the faint odor of leaf tobacco still lingered
on the vitiated air

  a forestlike array of heavy wooden up-
rights first claimed their attention each
post w as circled by bruce or his companion
after which all the dark comers were care-
fully explored

   they are not down here i am satisfied
of that said bruce

   so am i what comes next

   the stairs replied bruce indicating a
dusty flight leading to the floor above

  glancing upward bruce saw that there
was no door to negotiate at the head of
the steps in all probability it had long
since disappeared

  as they started to climb bailey touched
bruces arm  put out your light he
whispered

  bruce saw the wisdom of the suggestion
and complied with the request

   easy now-listen

  as both men strained to catch the slight-
est sound that would offer a clew to what
they might encounter the scraping of a door
was distinctly heard as if some one had
opened it with extreme caution after
mounting several more steps bailey again
placed his hand on bruces arm and repeat-
ed the cautionary listen

   i hear it said bruce after a moment
of silence  what is it

   deep breathing


argosy-allstory weekly

   with soft tread they mounted the last two
 steps and once more paused to get their
 bearings

   the impenetrable darkness was all about
 them and bruce wondered if they had
 acted wisely in extinguishing their light

    get out your matches he said

  in complying with the request bailey
moved and a board under his feet creaked
it was by no means a gentle sort of creak
but loud and insistent

   both men expected something to happen
 both instinctively crouched in the dark-
 but nothing occurred

   standing thus with every sense alert to
 interpret its vibratory signal they again
 heard the deep respiration of a person in
 slumber

    scratch your match said bruce

   a sharp quick stroke was heard as bailey
 followed instructions but no light it had
 missed fire

   at the same time the rasping noise they
 had previously heard was repeated-the
 scraping sound of a door that was hard to
 open

  both men turned and knew that they
were on the main floor of the old building
on a level with the street for not over fifty
feet away one of the big front doors had
been pushed open from the outside and a
flood of light from a convenient street lamp
disclosed the outlines of the person who had
opened it

  it was the girl or young woman who
was in sympathy with the negros inter-
ests after a hasty glance within she went
back to the sidewalk anxiety was reflected
in every move to secure a better view
down the narrow street she stepped from
the curb a moment later she returned to
the door-and closed it

    waiting for the negro was bruces low
 comment  now is your time to light the
 lantern-while the door is closed-then
 cover it with your coat

  bailey had scarcely complied with in-
structions when the girl again opened the
door she was laboring under great ex-
citement and apparently could not muster
the courage to advance beyond the thres-
hold

  as the light streamed in through the

 open doorway both men sought to increase
 dieir knowledge of the conditions which sur-
 rounded them

    look whispered bailey  to the right
-near the post-the negress-asleep she
is all in

    a-hah the deep breathing chuckled
bruce

  the girl had suddenly quieted down
there was a rumble of wheels coming from
the direction in which she was gazing and
her attitude had changed to one of assur-
ance framed in the doorway her trim
f-rure blocked against the glare of light she
stood like one who had gained the dignity of
a new personality

   not a line of her lithe form was lost to
bruce - the indefinable something that
might be called bearing or poise the fleet-
ing suggestion of a haughty spirit and
withal that touch of feminine grace which
defies analysis

  bruce recoiled at the vividness with
which these things were being etched upon
his mind

    shes a daughter of belial he finally
muttered dropping into the clerical vernac-
ular for the first time

    you said it grunted bailey

   for an instant bruce was nettled at his
friends ready indorsement then the ab-
surdity of his resentment annoyed him
his nerves had become frayed under the
nights ordeal it was a time for decisive
action rather than idle fancies

  the rumble of wheels had now become
louder-a definite pounding of steel tires on
the pavement and the beating of hoofs

   directly a carriage rolled into view be-
fore the open door and from it stepped the
negro it was evidently his intention to
load the big negress into it and get away
quickly

  wthat must have been a discussion of
route and destination then took place be-
tween the negro and the driver there was
a great deal of gesticulating and pointing in
the direction opposite to that from which
the carriage had come

    move down on the right said bruce
 and get behind that door close it the
minute they enter and are free from its
swing-then uncover your light
crafty rogues



   with due caution bailey crept forward
 he avoided the broad open space through
 the center of the warehouse by entering the
 shadows cast by a row of posts which were
 set at a distance of about ten feet from the
 side of the building there was a line of
 these uprights on both sides they flanked
 the open space

   now while it had been quite logical to
 expect that both the young woman and the
 negr-o would enter the building it failed to
 occur in this fashion the girl continued in
 conversation with the driver and carbon
 entered alone

   he had no light in fact he did not re-
 quire one as he knew where to find his
 charge and it would be a simple matter to
 grope about in the semidarkness until he
 located her

   bailey waited for the negro to advance
 well beyond the sweep of the closing door
 then it closed with a crash at the same
 time he withdrew his coat from the lan-
 tern

   like a flash the negro wheeled and his
 hand sought a convenient hip pocket
 whatever the weapon he was about to draw
 bruce took no chances with a bound he
 was behind him a fist shot through the
 air-there was a robust click as it caught
 eddie carbon behind the air-and the
 black man curled up and rolled away it
 really looked as if the negro was about to
 demonstrate the law of perfect motion
 which proclaims that a body oncc set in
 motion has a tendency to move on in a
 straight line forever

   bruce had knocked him into the gloomy
recesses behind the posts at the left of the
room his first inclination was to traverse
the space between himself and bailey so as
to gain possession of the lantern but cau-
tion made him stand by the negro who
might require a second installment of fistic
reasoning

   with this in mind he grasped the pros-
 trate negro by the collar and drew him out
 into the light

    get up he commanded

   the negro did not move either he had
been knocked unconscious or was feigning
bruce inclined to the latter opinion his
aching knuckles seconded the conclusion

no granite paving block could have inflict-
ed greater discomfort

   do it now he continued and by way
of coaxing kicked eddie carbon in the
shins-a kick that would eventually call
for cooling ointments

  it was magic a quiver of pain ran
through the body first he struggled to
a sitting position then with bruces assist-
ance gained his feet

   up with your hands was bruces next
command

  with limp body and sagging head the
negro lifted his arms while bruce hurriedly
searched his pockets they were empty
the ready movement toward his hip pocket
had been for the purpose of intimidating
bailey

  the discovery softened bruce after all
there had been no real danger and he was
sorry to have punished the negro so severe-
ly besides that he was showing symptoms
of real distress from the blow having
grasped his head with both hands he was
also moaning as if in pain

  even as bruce censured hipiself the ne-
gro fell to the floor it was a sprawling
headlong pitch into the shadows behind the
left-hand row of posts

   the light bruce called moving to-
ward bailey to receive it

  it was the very move that the negro
desired his thick skull had scarcely felt
the blow delivered by bruce he had
dropped as a matter of convenience-to give
himself time to think his distress had been
another bit of finished acting

  not over six feet from his head was a
door it had been hidden from bruce by
the line of posts-the shadows-the dis-
tance at which bailey stood with the light
not until the bang of the closing door was
heard did bruce realize that the negro had
escaped through it

  like a shot he was after him-through
the door into a vacant lot where the negro
was just clearing a high board fence on the
street side

  to the everlasting discredit of bruce de
lisle he used an expression that was-well
lets be charitable it sure was expressive

at various points within the inclosure
bruce saw the blurred outlines of trucks


argosy-allstory weekly

and carts which had been stored there
rows of racks and stakes that lifted from
the black shadows to pick his way
through this jungle of trucks would deprive
him of the initial momentum that would be
required to scale the fence eddie carbon
had taken it on the run he knew the open
spaces and had made the high board struc-
ture with ease

   hesitancy is credited with losing the most
of lifes prizes and bruce paused long
enough to lose eddie carbon so far as
following him over the fence was concerned
but the end was not yet there was the
warehouse and the door that opened onto
the street with this in mind bruce darted
back into the building

   the door-open it quick he shouted
to bailey

   it really seemed quite a simple thing to
do but after a frantic search for some
familiar device to take hold of bailey-to
his disgust-realized that there was none

   the presence of his clerical friend should
have restrained the sizzling outburst which
followed but it did not he popped a line
of vocal punctuations which would fail to
pass any editorial censorship unless ex-
pressed by a series of dashes

    th blooming handle-where is it be
finally spluttered

    a nice question to ask me protested
bruce with fine sarcasm  find it good
heavens andy bailey-you are muddling
it

  in vain they sought for some catch or
spring that would release the door forget-
ting that it had been part of the gambling
gentrys foresight to provide for just such
an emergency

   to add to their mortification they heard
the carriage roll away from the door for
the second time since becoming involved in
the cracker pot mystery they listened to
the clank of galloping hoofs as they receded
in the distance

    ive got it exclaimed bailey holding
the light far above his head and pointing
to a slot about two inches long that had
been cut into the door it was about six
feet from the floor and the last place any
one would think of looking

    much good it will do us now growled

bruce as he slid a pencil into the groove
and threw back the spring catch

  it would have been hard to find two men
more crestfallen than bruce de lisle and
andy bailey as they stepped out to the side-
walk in front of the old warehouse bailey
was nervously splintering a toothpick into
fragments convenient for blowing from his
mouth

   what is the colored population of this
country anyway he asked

   several million answered bruce
 why

   oh nothing in particular-except this
when they all commence making use of
their brains as cleverly as eddie carbon
can exercise his hold your hat on with
both hands thats all

   cheer up were out of the sewer
was bruces comment

   but not out of the swirling mess of
evil that eddies about the cracker pot

   hardly we have been whirling about
in circles ever since we made acquaintance
with the place look-connorss  house
of mirth  is down near the corner we are
but a short half block from its entrance
neither bruce nor his friend realized
that their disgruntled frame of mind was
occasioned by the terrific jar which had
been administered to their pride and of
all the inopportune moments for an addi-
tional blow this was the one it came
in that form of mental alarm which is
sometimes flashed in duplicate both men
received the shock at the same moment
both stupidly stared at the other hailey
was the first to voice their mutual thought
 the big negress-what in the name of
glory are we to do with her

  for the time being bruce lost that pro-
fessional asset so highly prized by the
clergy-his delivery blank amazement
spread over his face and in lieu of his ready
vocabulary he turned to a form of expres-
sion that resembled the spluttering of a
garden hose

  then as if to verify the universality of
those laws which govern mental telepathy
the giant negress waddled through the
warehouse door at any rate whatever the
medium of thought transference she evi-
dently knew that some conference closely

                         	a
crafty rogues



associated with her good and welfare was
about to take place and she wished to be
among those present

  refreshed and rejuvenated by her nap
the saffron-hued lady was once more in
evidence

  of course she never knew it but right
then and there her subsequent career was
indirectly influenced by the thing she did
although it was only what all women have
done at all times and ever will she talked
in quantity it was torrential-a combina-
tion of the whirlwind and the waterfall-
but neither man understood a word she
spoke

  a strange lingo gushed forth-one that
was strong in  ugs  and  wogs

   some kind of african palaver said
rruce his mind reverting to captain jake
and his congo voyage

   spickle english asked bailey  you
know-united states

  just why he should have considered it
necessary frantically to wave his hands and
murder his good anglo-saxon while asking
so simple a question no one but bailey
knew

   ug was the polite response

   guess it must mean  no  wtas bai-
leys comment

   ask her if she knows captain jake
suggested bruce thereby deferring to bai-
leys superior ability as a linguist

   wog answered the negress as if a
repetition of the question was superficial

   thats it was baileys cheerful com-
ment  you see wog means  yes and
 ug is  no in her talk

   i am glad you get along so nicely with
her chuckled bruce  because you will
have to chaperon the lady while i go for a
truck or something

  who me not on your life

   oh very well-come on then if you
think shes strong enough to walk

   hold on-wait a minute you mean to
say that we have got to walk the streets
with this

   certainly what are we going to do-
leave her on a pile of straw the same as we
did joie

  again the negress showed evidence of
comprehension-a quick appreciation of the
 a

fact that bailey was negative she had
grasped him by the arm with a clutch that
would revolutionize the automobile indus-
try if its registration could have been se-
cured in metal units

   leggo-leggo exclaimed bailey  no
holdum arm

   there you are remarked bruce with
due solemnity  isnt it beautiful-the
way she trusts you why man you have
a chance to make her your friend for life
 get the truck groaned bailey  get
two trucks-anything 

   ill hire a carriage down at the ferry
entrance and will be back before you know
it said bruce  if eddie carbon con-
sidered that it was safe to load her into a
four wheeler we ought to be willing to take
a chance

   all right bruce but for the love of
mercy do me a favor-have a heart you
know-pep-speed-get back quick will
you

  even as bailey finished he turned to the
negress and there was a note of imploring
protest in his voice

   let go arm-see take hand off-un-
derstand let loosey then i give nice
candy-smoke-tobac-anything

  without waiting to learn the result of
baileys efforts in the art of bribery bruce
hurried toward the ferry his way led past
the cracker pot and here he paused long
enough to peer through the windows but
there was little to be seen as the police had
left the place in darkness

  it was all very gloomy and depressing
so much so that he began to question the
sanity of his own and baileys allegiance to
a lost cause

  the strain of the night was beginning to
tell he was weary both in body and
mind his fighting spirit was on the wing
he was through they would load the big
negress into the carriage he was about to
engage and take her to the police station
it was time to call upon captain wallers
for assistance

  looking at his watch he found that it
was twelve thirty

   an hour from now ill be in bed was
his comment

   right there conscience blew a whistle or

 rang a bell-at any rate made some sort of
 a fuss

  how about the poor chap you left on
 the straw-down in the cracker pot cel-
 lar shouted conscience and the worst
 of it wras that the clarion voice kept on
 repeating the question  how about it

 how about it

   some concession had to be made to so
 persistent a monitor so bruce stepped to
 the curb to secure a better view of the
 cracker pot frontage no matter how
 weary he was some effort at concentration
 had to be made

   well there was the main entrance to the
 cracker pot certainly he knew all about
 that then there were two windows one
 each side of this entrance alt right there
 was nothing new about this either if he
 intended to gain entrance to the cracker
 pot for the purpose of releasing joie some
 starting point of greater value would have
 to be found

     how about the ladies entrance he asked
 himself

     he crossed the sidewalk and tried the
   door

    no use-it was locked

     returning to his point of vantage at the
    curb bruce for the first time gave attention
    to the buildings which flanked the cracker
    pot a ships chandlery on the right a rag
    shop on the left

    hello-what was this three doors to
   the rag shop building in the center the
   regulation store entrance to the right of
   that toward the cracker pot two more

    one evidently led to the apartments above
    one-well that was strange-where the
    mischief did it lead

       as he looked a breath of wind stirred

   there was a creak-a wee significant
   creak the door was swinging on its
   hinges it was open

       this was interesting placing his hand
     against it he found that without effort it
     swung back disclosing a long tunnel-like
     hallway or ahey one glance within and
     bruce understood

       there were tenements in the rear-a col-
     lection of ancient rookeries common to the
     older and more crowded districts of new

to be continued next

 york he saw that the alley had no con-
 nection with the rag shop except as it
 offered a means of reaching the rear houses

 and now conscience tendered its own re-
 ward it came as the result of bruces
 fixed attention on the problem relative to
 joie

    this alley-it might offer a solution to
  the vexed question  how did connors van-
  ish from the cracker pot

    once more bruce retired to the curb and
  from this point considered the value of his
  discovery there was no doubt but that
  the right-hand side of the alley was the re-
  taining wall of the cracker pot

    to venture within would have been in-
 discreet as he was without a light bai-
 leys embarrassing situation also called for
 relief at the earliest possible moment he
 would hurry to the ferry house engage the
 carriage place the negress in it under bai-
 leys charge and keep the whole outfit
 moving long enough to allow for a complete
 investigation of the promising alley at
 the ferry entrance he hired a weary-looking
 old chariot drawn by a team of horses that
 showed signs of life only by the fact that
 they were still in harness the owner and
 driver was one larry doyle-lifelong resi-
 dent and hackman of cherry hill

      the ride to the warehouse was a short
    one and as bruce emerged from doyles
    veteran coach he saw that bailey had evi-
    dently effected some sort of compromise
    with the negress as her arm was linked
    through his with all the confidence of a june
    bride

       escort your friend to the carriage
    said bruce

    so far as bailey was concerned speech
    would have been like unto the rustling of
    dried leaves or good wine wasted at the
    spigot english for him had become a dead
    language

       the combined efforts of the three men
      were required to squeeze the lagging sec-
      tions of the negress through the carriage
      door after which bailey climbed on the
      front seat by the side of doyle

         its a shame we cant make two loads of
      this was the latters comment as he noted
      the strain on the traces

week
by c donald feak

 outside the slosh and steady run of the chief mate of the new rat trap-and
 an angering sea an uneasy circle they were rat traps and hell ships too for
 laboring beneath the sullen gray of it was only rat traps and hell ships that
 heavy skies within the focsle an integral found it necessary to resort to shanghaing
 part of the stench and fetid darkness jerry sullivan was considered a shang-
 slumped heavily across the sodden confines haier of parts a story made the rounds
 of a bunk his eyes red gritty their pupils that he had once sent a dead chinaman to
 still obscure as to their functioning a man a ship in the harbor and collected his fee
  shanghaied- the word picked itself of twenty-five dollars before the ships offi-
 out sharply from the reeling jumble in his cers found it was not a case of drunken-
 brain he clung to it as something definite ness this was considered very unethical
 something that he could focus upon of jerry

  shanghaied- he danny whalen danny gingerly feeling the lump on his
 chief mate of the crack clipper ship flying head heard the door being unlocked some-
 cloud shanghaied like any drunken dock how he rose to his feet enough sense had
 rat aboard some rotten old packet	returned to him to realize that it would do

    it was in the days when a respectable him no good to protest and threaten in
  seaman couldnt even drop into jerry sulli- spite of his youth he was something of a
  vans  chain locker  for a nip and a ball philosopher and a good deal of a fatalist
  without the formality of being tapped on however if there were any  ruffles and
  the head and lowered into a waiting dory flourishes  coming to him he firmly decided
  the hell of it was that the formality he would give the chief mate the battle of
  didnt end there for the next  ruffle  or his life

    flourish  or whatever the devil the navy the door slammed back and in strode the
   men called it was to take a beating from mate


argosy-allstory weekly

  he was tall and bony deep-set watery
blue eyes blinked uncertainly from behind
red bushy eyebrows a small mouth
curved downward at the corners the nose
-a succession of lumps and ridges-resem-
bled a deformed and overripe tomato the
chin protruded bringing into prominence
a red sandy beard

   so harbor gaskets on an a b eh
he referred to the insignia on dannys col-
lar  come out on deck bucko and turn
to-and get a wiggle on or ill bust every
bone in your neck

  danny without answering left the fo-
csle and began to secure the ship for heavy
weather-coiling dowm lines and lashing the
gear about the decks that might get adrift
in the storm

  a cow-eyed norwegian slow in obeying
an order of the mate was promptly knocked
galley west and the curse you block-
headed scowegian when i say  chop-chop 
i mean chop-chop was thrown in for
good measure the norwegian brought up
against a huge block and lay there like a
stunned ox his shipmates eying him from a
distance one a breton slid cautiously
over to souse him with sea water wrhen
the mate put his fist back in the pocket of
his coat there were two senseless forms in
the waterway

  forward and aft the mate raged finding
fault kicking the slow for being stupid and
beating the quick for being wise he
was cowing his crew by using the tactics his
father had taught him  to lick every man
in the crew every day in the week only
once had he failed in his slogan a shang-
haied prizefighter had beaten him unmerci-
fully to a pulp the pulp however had
regained its solidity and the night of the
beating the ships log had spoken of one
 james watkins a b lost overboard

  danny recognized the mate as  gallopin
dan brannigan the hardest mate on the
pacific coast hated feared a slave-driver
of the old school he had been knived
beaten thrown overboard and yet had al-
ways survived

  when his watch below came around
danny found himself a bunk and sat there
listening to the grumbling of the crew four
of them were seamen the rest rabble from

the barbary coast a tough drunken lot of
dock rats the focsle-an evil-smelling
hole in the deck-was dark and shadowy
and smelled of oilskins and salt horse an
oil lamp that swung back and forth to the
rolling of the ship cast grotesque shadows-
painted additional evil on faces that were
perfect two english cockneys had drawn
off by themselves their clay pipes glowed
in the darkness-smoldered-darkened-
with the steady puffing of resignation

   the inevitable sea lawyer had the floor
and was saying  and he cussed and clout-
ed beat and kicked until i got tired of it
and so i went for him and did you swabs
help me pfthaa-sailors a bunch of
yaller-bellied chesapeake bay oyster
pirates

   and so it went-but soon the voice sank
low blended unintelligibly with the heaves
and creakings of the ship the listening
circle narrowed-drew in upon itself leaned
ever closer to the central figure who whis-
pered on and on and in whose voice there
had crept a note that was sinister

ii

  steadily the riding scud bore south-
westward two weeks after sailing gallop-
in dan brannigan had not lessened his
abuse beating at the slightest provocation
sending them aloft with a curse and a kick
and double irons for those who resented

   then one night the sea lawyer again held
the floor in the focsle it had been a
day of bitter torment he had slacked the
wrong brace and the mate had beaten and
cursed until captain mason had interfered
with the delicate warning that murder un-
fortunately he could not tolerate then
he had sent the sea lawyer forward to bathe
his injuries

         and i tell you right here the
voice half sobbed  that ill get square
with him if it takes me all my life i tell
you ill-

  the restless circle tightened-drew in
again upon itself again leaned closer to
the central figure who whispered on and
on in muted harmony with the sullen noises
of the ship

   it happened in a rush
the pedestal of command



  danny had been giving the murmurings
but the scantiest of attention during the
weeks he had numbed himself to his situa-
tion it was only a question of time
everything was only a question of time
eventually they would make port-he
would leave-perhaps exact a modicum of
personal vengeance-perhaps just forget
such things were understandable fated
patches in the quilt of a mans existence-
 danny whalen  the voice reached out
sharp and distinct from the murk from the
fumbled hush of the whisperings he
turned a puzzled eye toward the sea lawyer
who said  we need -again the voice
sank low- a leader

  there was no mistaking the import of it
 danny whalen the voice rushed on
with a hiss more sibilant than the waters
surging past outside  you had a mates
ticket why the hell dont you join us
youre the only one here that can navigate
a ship aint you got the guts the voice
rushed faster  youve stood aside and
said nothing and now by god-the
voice cracked sharply and pitched to a high
insane note- youll join us or well feed
you to the fishes take it or leave it-your
choice-here and now

  the faces of the circle were pivoted to-
ward him-tense-strained with the look
of fear mingled with the strengthening des-
peration the murk gleamed-flashed
strangely here and there with glints shot
off from steel-there were knives guns-

   yes danny whalen well slit your
throat if you dont and if you squeal may
god have pity on your soul

  they waited the timbers creaked
groaned and sighed in their endless conflict
with the restless sea the lamp swayed
on through calm unworried arcs the faces
were still-motionless sometimes an eye-
lash flicked

  danny slid a careless leg over the edge
of the bunk and stretched lazily as upright
as the narrow confines would permit when
he spoke his voice sounded curiously weary
-the baffled voice of intelligence trying to
make itself comprehensible to the minds of
children

   mutiny he stated evenly  is punish-
able by death then he added as a sop

a coating for the distasteful obviousness of
the fact that he had just offered  no
voyage lasts forever

  the truth however was not obvious
their grievances the welling flood of their
blind hatred were he sensed their utter
impregnability to reason

   dont he continued quietly almost
soothingly  be a lot of old women stick
it out look sense in the face do you
think you can take the ship from her officers
with a couple of guns-some knives-

   knives  the sea lawyers voice trem-
bled to a shriek  you think were fools
danny whalen-we aint-aint weve
weapons-weve busted through the after-
bulkhead and into the storeroom-there
aint nothing we dont need that aint hidden
in the chain locker i planned everything
were set-set i tell you-all but the navi-
gatin

   the bosun can do dead reckoning but
for what we need for the course we need to
set-to he leered knowingly cunningly at
the others  to get to the place what we
got to get to we need more we need
you danny whalen and by the livin god
well get you-alive if you do our navigat-
in and if you wont -the words dropped
with the precision of a steel hammer striking
against iron- well get you dead
another patch was shaping in the quilt
sense nodded to the overwhelming crush of
numbers-numbers welded to a deadly
power of unity by the searing fires of mul-
tiple and unconquerable hates the circle
weaving through the shadowed murk was
increased by one

iii

  there came a night when the riding
scud a pawn for the uncertain winds fell
off the careless helmsman drowsed a
wretched dreary figure at the wheel the
mate standing at the taff-rail talking with
the skipper in low tones sawr the vessel
lose way with a bound he snatched a be-
laying pin from the fife-rail and struck the
drowsing helmsman a blow on the head
the man crumpled without a sound

   blundering fool-ill teach you to doze
at the wheel the mate bellowed kicking
the senseless form again and again


argosy-allstory weekly

  bosun he roared send that mob
of fishermen on deck or by the wench that
gave you birth ill send you to hell with
her chop-chop now you carrion

  softly quietly his lips barely parting to
permit the words to flow through the sea
lawyer standing at the top of the ladder
spoke in a whisper to each man as he
came up

  danny realized that the moment had
come he looked at the mate outlined rug-
gedly against the gray sky-at the slinking
muttering rats of men that drifted past him
from the ladder head his mind sickened
revolted at the patch that was being fitted
in-there was something beyond the mean-
ing of the moment that he had failed to
grasp-something that had eluded him-
that was eluding him still

  the surface urged that here was simply
a case of rottenness fighting rottenness with
the devil at hand as a judge between the
two and yet in spite of all everything in
him everything that had gone to the mak-
ing of his training urged him to the other
side-at whatever cost-at whatever sacri-
fice-to that other side where the mate
stood alone impregnable superb in his ar-
rogance of power of authority standing
four-square-no matter how dirty the feet-
upon the pedestal of command that high
ideal that must remain unshaken through-
out the endless reaches of the sea

  it no longer eluded danny-that was it
what he had been groping for searching for
in the darkness of his indecision he was
an officer-above all else-no matter what
had happened to him or what the fates had
hurled upon him the idea stood out plain
and straight his place belonged back aft
-with them

  he passed the mainmast darted through
to the starboard side and raced for the poop

  the sea lawyer was there before him

  he heard the whining voice curiously
clear above the noises of the deck  mr
mate we dont like your habits or your
langwidge or your tongue

  gallopin dan brannigan his mouth
agape at the monumental insolence drew
his fist back to strike

  from somewhere in the silent group of
men in back of the sea lawyer came a single

shot the fist sank weakly-brannigan
hesitated-mute-resisted to the last the
sapping weakness that forced him to his
knees-superbly kept his head upright
then with the expenditure of his power
bowed slowly to the deck

  danny saw the splendid collapse a sick-
ening lump clogged his throat dumbly he
tried to move forward-to take his place
before them his knees felt weak his feet
leaden his mind refused to function the rest
was blurred-chaotic

   the second mate a sickly youngster fresh
from school broke the spell of hypnotic
stillness by jerking out his pistol and firing
hysterically at the crowd

  the boatswain screamed as the bullet
pierced his side

  that scream broke all hell loose from
a group of stunned silent men they whirled
into a wild maniacal mass of animals-
fighting yelling clawing they reached
the poop deck and fell upon the second mate
and the skipper and bore them down

   the sea lawyer his face livid with hate
was cursing kickingand stabbing the body
of his tormentor his face had lost all sem-
blance of human form his mouth dripped
foam flecks of blood spattered his lips
where his teeth had punctured the skin

  the vessel had swung about and was
running free-her yards yawed back and
forth in crazy abandon - the rigging
whipped and strummed at the strain im-
posed upon them

   fifteen minutes after the mate had struck
the helmsman it was all over his body had
been cast into the sea along with those of
the skipper and the second mate the sea
lawyer gripped the situation at its flux-
the uncertain moment when reaction sets
strongly in and opens the gates of mob ac-
tion to the bitter coldly clear forces of rea-
son-and of fear

   what i say -the men stopped short
and listened- from this here moment on-
goes and he pointed a meaning finger
over the side  whalen  he snapped
 where are you

  then as danny stepped out from the
darkness  i want you to come with me
the rest of you go forward stand your
accustomed watches as before keep her on
the pedestal of command



her old course after mr danny whalen
here gets busy then well shift her to the

new

  the sea lawyer lead the way to the cap-
tains cabin

  a deathlike apathy had seized upon dan-
nys mind dumbly he tried to excuse him-
self to himself-there had been so little
time in fact no time at all before the
shambles the peaked sickly white face
of the hysterical second mate wavered ner-
vously before him the stolid splendid
sinking to his knees of brannigan sponged
with a single gesture all the ugly markings
from his slate whereas he danny - the
word gave him almost a pleasurable feeling
from the very hurt of it-had been a skunk
to his ideal to all that-

  a solitary object lying carelessly upon
the leather settee of the captains cabin
sent a stunning shock ripping through his
brain he wondered in a lightning flash
whether or not the sea lawyer had noticed
it with irritating precision and watchful-
ness he circled the room and tossing his
coat over the object hid it from sight

  it was a womans shawl

iv

  there was nothing particularly remark-
able about the shawl-a light flimsy thing
of wool-the remarkable thing was that it
should have been there at all no breath
of a woman being aboard had been sensed
in the forecastle the fact implied a num-
ber of things they curveted through
dannys mind during the trifling period of
time it had taken him to cross over and
conceal the amazing object beneath his coat

  if she had been the sort of woman who
sometimes finds her way aboard for a pas-
sage or two before being flung back upon
the streets she came from no such efforts
would have been made on the part of the
old man to conceal the fact of her presence
on the ship that no one aft had known of
her led danny to suspect that she wasnt
one of that sort at all that she was some
one of importance some relative of one of
the officers perhaps - the idea seemed
the most likely of the lot-the captains
daughter

  on the other hand there might be no
woman at all the shawl might simply have
been there-somehow-anyhow-

  and still-

  the sea lawyer must not know none
of them must know even suspect until
danny had made sure it struck him that
the gods had in some sort of fashion offered
hima way out set miraculously a task be-
fore him the accomplishing of which would
efface the stain of his dishonor might make
him fit again in his own mind once more
to mount the pedestal that symbolized to
him command he would protect her-
fight for her and if necessary die for her

   turning to the sea lawyer he said  ill
put her on her course as soon as you give
me the position you want to go to

   on a large table that stood near the door
were the charts and the ships log on
the chart danny saw the vessels position
for the previous noon marked by a small
dot and circled dividers pencils parallel
rulers and erasers were scattered over the
chart just as they had been left there by
the skipper before- he shuddered the pic-
ture away his eyes clung to a bookcase
overhead it held besides the usual bow-
ditch azimuth tables and nautical alma-
nac a treatise on ornithology and a novel
of gertrude atherton

   here it is whalen and remember -
the little pig eyes of the sea lawyer glittered
balefully- no monkey business and no
questions 

  plotting the position given him danny
brought the point of his pencil to rest upon
a dead-white chart four hundred miles to
northward was a group of islands another
group spattered delicately an equal distance
to the northwestward the latitude and
longitude given him however set square on
an unnamed island represented on the chart
by a dot

   the course he said  will be south-
souwest until moming

  the sea lawyer nodded mutely he stood
before the glass tapping it gently with a
grimy finger  dropping he muttered
 dropping hard-im going up to take a
look for the time being whalen youll
stay in there when i dont want you on
deck


argosy-allstory weekly

   he hesitated a moment and then added

 i mights well tell you were gonna sell the
cargo for what we can git and then scuttle
this left-handed baly-hoo theres your
room

   the sea lawyer indicated a door on the
starboard side and mounted the ladder to
the deck

   danny a slender feeling of exaltation
creeping over him opened the door of the
room that was to be his

   from out of the gloom that shrouded the
narrow confines of the cabin he caught the
slightest suggestion of a startled quickly
smothered intake of a persons breath

v

   pop-hes gone the girl faced
danny staring searchingly at him through
a pair of hard jade eyes

    skipper

   she nodded

    yes miss danny stared blindly over-
head  so he added  is the rest of
them the rest -the words were dust-
 of them that counts

   she looked at him curiously speculative-
ly he wondered why she didnt cry
daughters he figured when their fathers
were dead should cry

    im sorry he muttered the state-
ment sounded hollow-a mockery of the
tumult inside him-worse than a wastage of
words he wanted her to kill him in-
stead she stated in a perfectly even and
controlled voice

   why

   he told her-loosed the hideous mess of
self-condemnation that had been festering
within him he felt immensely relieved
plunged at the end of his recital into a hesi-
tant stumbling avowal of the things he was
going to do for her-to atone-to erase in
some measure the stain explained fum-
blingly to her precisely what in his eyes
she stood for

  and at the end the jade in her eyes
glinted into him pricked their needle points
into the clear blue of his own

    youre goin to keep me safe from the
sea lawyer and the rest she said

    until i die the utter simplicity of

its deliverance relieved the statement of its
  banality

  youre a queer un

  i suppose i am-queer things he
 hastened on  bother me

  mat things

  queer things-like souls

  an uncertain light filtered in upon her
   youll keep me she said  even-from
  yourself

  from myself

  you wouldnt want-me

   it aint a question of that

  se raised a speculative finger tip to the
  edge of her teeth

  so

 danny wheeled the word had slithered
 from some one standing behind him

 the sea lawyer stood framed in the open
 door

vi

  by god the sea lawyer grinned ami-
 cably at the two of them  a slut 
 danny his face dead-white closed with a
 rush after the first smashing blow the
 sea lawyer his fists doubled into enormous
 hams and his head lowered let out a roar of
 angry amazement and settled clown to work
 danny met him shoulder to shoulder they
 dealt out man-killing punishment with
 no attempts at parrying they battered

  danny went to his knees his face bruised
  and bleeding his head swimming the sea
  lawyer rushed in to finish with his feet
  what he had battered to his knees with his
  hands danny saw him charging toward
  him and he rose to his feet and clinched
  fighting for his strength he landed a
  mighty right hook flush on the jaw and the
  sea lawyer clung to him crushing him
  around the middle they broke-blood
  dripped from dannys mouth it ran down
  his chin over his naked bruised chest and
  vanished into the tangle of rags that swung
  from his hips the remains of his shirt

 the sea lawyer swaying drunkenly his
 lips drawn taut over tobacco-stained teeth
 his black hairy chest showing angry red
 welts staggered and caught himself on the
 edge of the table preparing for a rush that
 would end it all danny watched him
 through bleared glazed eyes unconsciously
the pedestal of command



he braced himself for the supreme struggle
the sea lawyer bellowed spouted little
drops of blood and saliva from his mouth
he half fell half rushed the intervening
distance and struck at the reeling figure that
swam past him wildly-madly he struck
again and again-his arms slowed down
for a brief instant he saw a form stretched
grotesquely into a heap of shuddering flesh

   danny felt a soul-shaking blow the earth
swam in drunken circles-somehow-some
one-gently lowered him to the deck-he
could feel it with his hands he struggled
mightily with his arms and legs they were
dead they wilted slowly gently under him
and through the haze that was closing his
eyes stealing away his senses he saw-

   in the comer apart from it all stood the
girl with the jade eyes infinitely nearer
swaying in circles towered the sea lawyer
she crossed the cabin nodded down at him
and turned toward the sea lawyer

    hes a queer un she said

  and permitted herself to be enfolded in
the eager grip of the sea lawyers arms

 vii

  the moon circled with a huge halo was
the first presage of the storm the sky was
blotched with rapidly drifting clouds the
ship ran into soft easy glassy swells she
bowed down deep to them rolling and pitch-
ing restlessly her ancient timbers groaning
and creaking

    the moon came out at intervals it
  showed glassy hard upon the rolling surface
  of the sea

     the wind behaved erratically hauling
  back and forth driving the exhausted sea-
  men from brace to brace increasing in in-
  tensity and dying back to a mere breath
  the barometer faltered and fell rose slug-
  gishly and dropped again-in the space of
  half an hour

    and danny beaten in body and soul
  stumbled out upon the deck

                      viii

     its up to you whalen-we-i-
  the sea lawyer spread one hand in a help
  less gesture

 i

   to hell with you and the ship-and
her

   youll die-with the rest of us
whalen the voice whined incessantly on
through the singing of the strident wind

   i know

   youre a hell of an officer whalen
danny stood on the poop in the lee of the
cabin his fingers grasping the rail tightly
he answered through the swirling storm of
water that blew past him-his eyes fixed
on the slim graceful spars that cut wide
swaths against the gray angry sky

   i aint an officer he said but id
like to pretend i am-once more

   you means you never had a ticket
the sea lawyer shouted at him  you
means you been stringing us all

   not that i have a ticket all right-

   then what tell-

   its something you wouldnt understand
-no one would ever understand

   then save us whalen you knows
what to do

  danny nodded quietly  ill save my-
self he said  ill save that part of me
thats cryin out for help-and maybe if
the imitations good enough-maybe when
were all down there-together-

  the dawning day had been ushered in
by a roaring blast of wind that had whipped
spare rope ends into tatters had sent great
green seas tearing past roaring in crazy
abandon their white tops torn into shreds

  the riding scud rose and fell with the
seas when she hesitated and struck the
water pounded her unmercifully sea after
sea piled aboard her filling the sea boots of
the men making their oilskin clothes a
mockery her sails snapped and cracked
with the fury of the storm

    the faces of the men ran rivulets of
  water the bosun faced for a moment the
  full force of the wind it whipped his beard
  until it looked like soaked rope yarn

     danny eased her labor through the storm
  he feared the sails would go the sea was
  on his port bow she was racing along a
  green slide one moment and bucking a mon-
  strous white-combed giant the next

     a huge wave rose directly under the life-

-	boat and smashed it to splinters leaving
  only the blocks and falls hanging there

  it began raining the wind lashed their
faces with it stung them and then blew it
down their already soaked necks

  a great gray sea lifted her bow up and
up and then with a rush left her there sus-
pended in mid-air she dropped with a
crash the earth seemed to hesitate in its
flight it threw the sea lawyer flat on his
face-then a crashing swishing roar and a
wave more terrible than any before
smashed the door to the galley washing
the cook out on deck raced aft and crushed
the watch against the bulkhead and sub-
sided with a swash and a gurgle as it ran
out through the scuppers the watch fled
below

  to hell with the ship and with orders
too sobbed the sea lawyer throwing his
oilskins on the sodden drunken deck they
crawled into their bunks and listened to the
sea tumbling down above their heads

  danny didnt care let them go let
them sink like sick rats if they cared to
all he wanted was to ride the storm-to
have his hand his feet where they should
be when the last plunge came-to breast
the anger of the heavens and the seas four-
square on the pillar he was struggling to
erect afresh

  the hard gust came as he had been ex-
pecting it bent the masts with their scanty
canvas a boom told him something had
carried away a black whirling shred
whipped over his head and he knew it was
a sail a cracking smash and the foremast
came down splintering close to the deck
the tangled mass of rigging creating a maze
of rope wire and splintered wood

  she listed to starboard-a hurried fev-
ered murmur and the men below staggered
out on deck the last agony of desperation
seized them - maddened crazed they
hacked at the wreckage that strewed the
decks-reacting frantically to each com-
mand that somehow reached them from the
solitary figure on the poop-the quiet tri-
umphant voice that pierced the medley of
the winds and storm

  wave after wave came aboard the rag-
ing blind darkness howled and sang a high
soprano through the remaining rigging

  the horizon had advanced to within an
arms length of the ship the main topsl

carried away snapping the lines that held

it like so much twine

   she comes the cry almost of exul-
tation hurtled from the poop

  a big foaming sea came charging like a
maddened giant-it towered up and up-
up above the men who scrambled for safety
-up like a wall of green glass hung for a
bare instant-and dropped like a broken
thing the riding scud stopped and wavered
she gave a sickening lurch and rolled over
to leeward dipping her gunwales

  half naked and staring wildly the men
clutched any manner of support and clung
there their feet kicking and sliding on the
slanting slippery decks doors flew open
all manner of gear belonging to seamen
came tumbling out upon the sea they
dug their fingers into each other in a mad
attempt to hold on to the only thing that
promised them life others dug wildly at the
deck for support

    cut cut  their voices yelled hysteri-
cally  god in heaven--the mast-cut it
shes coming back shell come-

   and just as the vessel struggled back like
some tired thing a sea that blanketed out
the very sky itself whirled smashing down
upon diem

ix

  the wind died slowly as if reluctantly
and thwarted of its purpose at sunset
the sun broke through in a golden glance
that bathed the mastless derelict that floated
on the bosom of the ocean with a coat of
gold the sea weary of strife passed into
a long rolling swell that rocked the half-
sunken craft to and fro

   the girl with jade eyes stood staring at
the figure wedged ujxm the poop stared at
the pale bronzed skin she leaned over
and drew the lids until they hid the fixed
blue pupils of the eyes she looked quiz-
zically at the smile resting so lightly upon
lips that were at peace

   she turned her gaze and let it dwell upon
the cruiser bearing down upon her from the
west

   he was a queer un she mumbled
stupidly and with deft fingers set about
the rearranging of her dress for her entrance
into the approaching world of different men

pulsating love letters

  ll read them aloud answered field-
   i ing grinning

a he opened the first letter and
cleared his throat to read garry paced
nervouslyacross the room and back he
fumbled for his cigarette case - found a
cigarette and lighted it

    well he cried impatiently tossing
the match away

    it begins just with his name said
fielding  guy

      i am furious with you ordinarily i would
   not write to you at all but i am casting all
   discretion to the winds to-night i am really
   very angry with you you pretend to be in
   love with me but you dont behave as if
   you are you go on flirting outrageously with

half the women in town and probably say
the same pretty things to them that you say
to me-and i wont have it it makes me
too disgustingly cheap you must stop it or
stop making love to me thats flat i will
not share you with any one do you hear
its bad enough to care about you at all i
wouldnt if i could help it because i really
dont like you or admire you or respect you
but you have somehow managed to make me
care-i dont know how i am in the grip
of this tremendous infatuation that is making
me act like a little fool-and i know it-and
you know it but you dont know this-
that there is as much hate mixed up in it
as there is love-and im a very uncertain
quantity i dont even understand myself so
you cant possibly understand me and what
i want to do now is to warn you you are
playing with dynamite young man when
you play with me you cant treat me
lightly im not at all the sort of girl that
you have known before the same tricks
wont work and there is a force working in

  me callcd pride-that is likely to cause trou-
  ble so dont try to make me jealous and
  dont think you can make me one of a string
  of silly girls who flutter about you and gur-
  gle with delight whenever you deign to give
  them your attention i will be everything
  or nothing you must make up your mind
  to that and decide which when you have
  decided let me know and then i will decide
  what to do about you until to-night

                             katherine

  garry dropped upon the edge of the big
sleeping couch looking quite gray and hag-
gard he was trembling

  u some letter mused fielding putting
it back into its envelope

   an honest letter said garry  from
a girl who plays fair and tries hard to look
facts in the facc

   and the main fact is-shes mad about
him added fielding

   infatuated said garry

   what difference what you call it she
certainly tells him to watch his step with
the others or hell have to answer to herl
and that looks like evidence to me

   read the rest of them said garry
  fielding opened the second one

   this hasnt any beginning at all he
said  it just starts off-

      its all very well for people to scoff at the
  long arm of coincidence in fiction and plays
  but strange things do happen like that last
  night at two oclock i was coming home from
  the rainesfords dance and i saw louise get-
  ting into a taxi in front of your door wasnt
  that odd-that out of all the millions of people
  in this town it was just  that chanced to be
  passing at that moment and saw her poor
  guy all your time wasted all your elabo-
  rate camouflage in vain all your cheating
  and lying and trickcry discovered but
  never mind perhaps it is as great a relief to
  you to have this trying affair ended as it is
  to me god i am happy to feel free of you
  at last i have hated your hold on me-your
  attraction for me i am glad it is over
  because i have always despised you in my
  heart and loathed myself for caring and
  still i did care but not now i see you at
  last-the shallow deceitful vile little beast
  that you are-and its finished

                                          k

   was that the last letter asked garry
hopefully

   no answered fielding comparing the
postmarks  there were two after thatl

   well lets have them get it over
for pitys sake cried garry

  fielding read

    dear beast 
 w you are right you are not worth caring
 for and i would stop caring gladly if i could

  i have tried  have looked at myself in the
  glass and told myself just how worthless you
  are i have walked the floor scorning myself
  and reviling you-dragging out all your petty
  cheap little weaknesses and faults and failings
  but it is all so useless  still count that day
  lost on which i do not feel your arms around
  me it is hideous-revolting to me-this slav-
  ery to the feeling you arouse in me but i
  cannot stem to break the spell i have mo-
  ments of wishing that i were dead and out of
  it all-or that you were how gladly i would
  weep over your lifeless form even the agony
  of learning to do without you would be so
  welcome-sweet grief for i hate loving
  you i hate it you arouse things in me that
  i detest why has no one ever killed you

  i cannot imagine so many must have want-
  ed to i have iain in the dark wide-eyed
  and pictured myself doing it it would be so
  glorious to be free if ever a man came
  out of hell surely you did and i know that
  if i yield to you you will drag me back
  there with you but still-i temporize-and
  drift every day nearer destruction it is
  only early afternoon-and already i am long-
  ing for to-night we will dance and forget-
  to-night

                     yours

k

    what letters to write to him what
can he have thought of them wondered
garry

    they evidently pleased him for he
kept them answered fielding  he must
have been proud of them-and of his power
over her what man would not be a
girl like that even if his influence was
an evil one-and she knew it and hated it
-just to realize that you could overwhelm
her judgment - her intellect - her will-
power that must have been the crown-
ing achievement of his life

   poor katherine whispered garry
through dry lips poor tortured kidl
fielding unfolded the last letter

  he began

    dfar beast 

  you frightened me last night you must
  not try to hurry me i am thinking-hard

  i am always thinking what to do about you-
  night and day i and yet i seem to know deep
the dance of death



 down inside myself that you must win me
 in the end bccause i have never denied my-
 self anything i have ever wanted and i have
 never wanted anything as much as i want
 you i know too that only suffering and
 misery can come of it i know you wont
 be faithful i know it isnt in you to be
 true you will make me wretched-prob-
 ably beat me-surely break my heart and
 yet i cant bring myself to give you up my
 only hope is that circumstances will inter-
 vene and save me-some outside influence
 come in and take the whole decision out of
 my hands i pray every night that i may
 not surrender but i make no other effort
 to resist you i suppose the world would
 think this weak of me but so few women
 feel as much as  feel or suffer as much as i
 suffer this infatuation for you is a kind of
 madness burning in my blood i can no more
 resist it or quench it than one can resist or
 quench fever and i will succumb to it in
 the end inevitably as one succumbs to fever-
 unless i am saved i have moments too of
 planning to run away once i had my bags
 packed and once i went to tea with you
 with my brothers revolver-loaded-in the
 pocket of my coat but you were so sweet--
 so deferential-so humble-and yet so com-
 pelling-so masterly-t could not do uhat i
 had foolishly planned to do but you must
 not hurry me the moment for my decision
 will come and i will choose meanwhile-
 for me this hell of indecision of vaccillation
 of doubt and fear and dread for you pa-
 tience the trap is set your prey is snared
 soon you will be devouring me wait tran-
 quilly	 k

 staring

 at
 killed

   you see cried fieldin

  garry with burning eyes  she
  him its as plain as it can be

   impossible  cried garry

   but she as much as says it she ad-
  mits she had thought of it she had even
  gone with a loaded pistol these letters
  are conclusive proof no jury in the world
  could listen to them and still retain any
  doubt

      no jury must ever know they exist
  cried garry

      im afraid you cant prevent that
  said fielding

     the eyes of the two men met then garry
  rose and advanced upon fielding

     give them to me he said in a low
  voice

    no-no funny business now

    give them to me he repeated more
  menacingly

    i wont i tell you justice has got to
 be done joan has got to be cleared i
 warn you-

   but what his warning was garry never
 knew for before fielding finished speaking
 garry was upon him vigorously with
 more strength than you would have thought
 he possessed fielding resisted struggling
 pommeling each other viciously they
 clinched fell and rolled over and over upon
 the floor

   at the first onslaught fielding had thrust
 the letters behind him-and then had
 dropped them as garrys clutch tightened
 upon his wrist and there the letters lay
 scattered upon the thick rug as they fought
 and they fought like demons each man
 thirsting for the others blood-each man
 for the woman he loved

  but garry was stronger gradually
 fieldings resistance grew less and sud-
 denly under the force of garrys repeated
 blows he collapsed and lay in a heap on
 the floor - pale - motionless - scarcely
 breathing

  garry wasted no time upon him on
 his hands and knees he bent to gather up
 the letters-those damning letters in kath-
 erines own writing against which no coun-
 ter testimony or legal advisers could defend
 her here he knew was her life in his
 hands

   he had got them all and was preparing
 to tear them across when he felt a sharp
 stab in his leg

   turning he found fielding over him
 with a hypodermic in his hand and an ex-
 pression of cunning on his face he had
 tried trickery when he felt his strength fail-
 ing and realized that in a fistic encounter
 garry must win he had only pretended
 to collapse and he had seized the oppor-
 tunity-when garrys back was turned-
 to bring out his hypodermic needle and
 shoot an injection into garry carpenters
 leg

     struggling against the powerful effect of
   the drug garry tried to rise with the let-
   ters still clutched in his hands but now
   fielding was more than a match for him
   he kicked out viciously sending garrv
   sprawling and as he lost consciousness
   his one agonized thought was that kath-


argosy-allstory weekly

erine would be left-defenseless-with sil-
vers and fielding and the letters against
her

chapter xiii

bartlett and the dark angel

as garry lost consciousness moffat
 fielding drew a long breath of re-
lief then-with a swift stealthy
look about-he filled the hypodermic again
inserted it in his own arm with trembling
fingers and shot the piston home the
drug which had acted so swiftly as a nar-
cotic upon garry merely quieted and stim-
ulated fielding irritable nervous almost
irresponsible without it he became-almost
in the twinkling of an eye-calm and cool

   he picked up the letters and thrust them
carefully into his outer pocket then he
glanced down at garry uneasily

  he did not know how long the drug
would keep him inactive as its effect dif-
fers considerably upon different systems
and he was most anxious to detain him in
da costas apartment for some little time
to come accordingly he confiscated the
heavy tasseled ropes that held back the
damask hangings in the drawing-room and
with these bound the unconscious mans
ankles and wrists securely thus making
assurance doubly sure he switched off the
main lights leaving only the dim lamps
burning and let himself out

   nobody questioned him as he went down
in the lift and passed out through the gor-
geous foyer into the night again none of
the attendants in the hall even looked in-
quisitive or interested they were accus-
tomed to comings and goings from da
costas apartment at all hours of the day
or night and as he was one of the build-
ings most promptly paying tenants they
had been carefully instructed not to annoy
him in any way

   the big doors swung closed behind field-
ing and he hailed a taxi with wildly beat-
ing heart

    the king of clubs he called through
dry lips to the chauffeur

   but as the cab sped along he chuckled
hoarsely to himself

  he was enjoying the adventure for its
own sake as well as rejoicing in his triumph
over garry for joan he had a mind fash-
ioned for plots and conspiracies in a dif-
ferent environment under different influ-
ences he might have been a great states-
man or a daring criminal but he was only
moffat fielding-an idler- a nonentity

   he had moments of realizing his lost op-
portunities and squandered talents how-
ever and it was this perhaps that drew
him to joan she was a might-have-been
too they had that bond in common-the
consciousness of each others potentialities
certainly she had been kinder to him-
more understanding-than any other wom-
an he had ever known-kinder and more
understanding even than his mother his
mother had expected such great things of
him-had dreamed such big dreams she
had never been able to reconcile herself to
him as he was but joan knew so much
more about life she had lived out in the
open fighting for survival with any weap-
ons that came to hand how could any
sheltered woman know the things joan
knew

   fielding admired joan because she had
succeeded she had conquered poverty
she had triumphed over disease and want
and care she had even defeated men
fielding never thought of all that she had
lost in her battle with life he thought
only of what she had won-ease comfort
luxury and she had faced her fight alone

   he felt that he needed her now desper-
ately and that nothing he could do to in-
sure her freedom wtould be too much they
were two of lifes derelicts - clinging to-
gedier and he felt that his was the
strength that was buoying them up it
gave him an ecstatic feeling of strength
and manhood-this thought

   as the cab pulled up before silverss new-
est and latest club fielding paid the tariff
and dismissed it around the corner he
found the little door again from which he
had emerged with garry and entering he
mounted the iron steps two at a time he
knocked softly upon the door at the top-
the door hidden behind the swinging mir-
ror-and charlie admitted him
the daxce of death



  x alone he asked curiously

   yes wheres silvers asked field-
ing noncommittally

    talking to a friend of his inside ill
tell him youre here

     wait upstairs agreed fielding

  and be ran up to the little french draw-
ing-room and strode up and down the land-
ing there impatiently as he waited for
the door was locked

  silvers m the absence of the other two
men had observed a decided unwillingness
in himself to remain alone in the room
with the stiffening corpse he bethought
himself of his old friend bartlett alone at
his table in the supper room and decided
to go down and chat with him to pass the
time leaving charlie to watch for the re-
turn of garry and fielding with instruc-
tions to summon him again when he was
wanted he crossed the room to bartletts
table bartlett looked up as he ap-
proached and mustered what strength he
had left to smile a greeting

   hello you look kind of pale any-
thing wrong asked silvers observing at
once-in spite of his own preoccupation-
the other mans ashen face

    oh no just a little tired thats all
answered bartlett  its pretty close in
here

   anything i can get you asked sil-
vers solicitously

    no thanks answered bartlett  noth-
   ing

  he moved the napkin cautiously making
  sure that the telltale blood stain was well
  hidden in spite of his long friendship with
  silvers he did not know how far silvers
  was to be trusted he had found it a
  pretty good policy in his later years not
  to trust any one and he preferred to go
  on playing a lone hand now-as long as he
  could

     silvers sensed his unwillingness to con-
   tinue the subject of his physical condition
   and tactfully dropped it turning to the
   waiter to order sharply

    li here more champagne

     bartlett chewed upon his cigar and wait-
   ed he was wondering what had brought
   silvers back-wondering if the police had
   come-if any one was suspected of the

crime a dozen questions framed them-
selves in his mind and were suppressed

 its very interesting here was what
he actually said  they laugh and dance
and chatter as though there werent a care
in the world

his eyes-half closed-were fixed upon
silverss face with well-disguised keenness

 yes they laugh and dance answered
silvers leaning forward grimly  while a
man lies dead upstairs

 dead repeated bartlett

 murdered

they wtere gazing straight at each other
now bartlett warily silvers interested to
observe the effect of his dramatic announce-
ment

 whats that you say asked bartlett
slowly he was aware of the quickened
beating of his heart--and he wondered if
the blood was coming faster

 my dancer - da costa - has been
killed whispered silvers cautiously  i
havent let them know of course dont
want a panic havent even called in the
police yet

ah breathed bartlett in relief it
was impossible to hold back the exclama-
tion

eh asked silvers

 isnt it dangerous to delay asked
bartlett  wont you have to answer to
them for it

 ive got some pull said silvers  be-
sides ive got a kind of private detective
working on the case quietly we are hop-
ing to get the goods on the murderer be-
fore dawn you see whoever did it is in
this house still the doors have been
locked since midnight

    have you any clews asked bartlett
the waiter poured the champagne bart-
lett wet his lips with it

   t no thats the worst of it no regular
dews like you usually get in murder cases
but we got a couple of girls under sus-
picion

    girls repeated bartlett

  yes we think a woman did it he
was the kind of a guy to be mixed up with
women you know whats that the french
say

    cherchcz la femme quoted bartlett


argosy-allstory weekly

and he smiled it was a smile of triumph
-and yet an ironic smile too  cherchcz
la femme

   means  find the woman dont it
grunted silvers

   it does admitted bartlett  so
thats it eh youre investigating these
girls

    after em hot-footed silvers assured
him  if youre interested you can come
up and look the ground over if you like
hes still up there-just as we found him
maybe you might get an idea about solving
this mystery that weve missed

   no said bartlett slowly  no i
dont think im interested not interest-
ed besides the fewer you take up there
the better if you want to avoid arousing
suspicion these jiggers of yours would
soon take fright if they got an idea what
was up i guess youll handle the affair
all right by yourself nat

   well im going to do my damnedest
silvers assured him  what a stroke of
luck can you beat it my first night
here and this thing happening if it
gets a lot of notoriety it  ruin me-and
id hate to tell you how deep im in here
i got to turn over the murderer and hush
the whole thing up if i can i got to
bartlett nodded he hadnt thought
about silvers when he plunged the knife
into da costas throat and squared that
score he was sorry for silvers now but
he told himself consolingly that silvers was
the kind of man who always lands on his
feet besides he was beginning to feel
very tired and weak he saw the room
now only vaguely-as though through a
mist and he took a fresh grip on himself
setting his teeth and warning himself that
if he let go and fainted theyd find the
wound and-maybe guess

  charlie approached and tapped silvers
on the shoulder

    fieldings back hes waiting for you
upstairs he said

    right cried silvers eagerly and rose
 now well see he called back to bart-
lett as he disappeared charlie followed
him bartlett held on tight until both men
had moved away then he fell forward with
a crash across the table but the wild bar-

baric beat of the jazz band smothered the
sound of his fall he had not strength
enough to raise himself his mind was
growing hazy the music and the laughter

blended confusingly in his ears he closed
his eyes wearily the lights hurt them so

  and his last conscious thought was-
whether they had evidence enough against
one of those girls to send her to the chair
if he died without confessing-there would
be no one else who knew the truth that
he reflected was pretty awful

  but somehow he didnt seem to care
nothing seemed to matter

chapter xiv

in the abyss invisible

at katherines table jack kendall be-
came very drunk he seldom took
much liquor because he was a very
steady-going young man who declared that
it was folly to drink ones self into a state
of unconsciousness or imbecility ordi-
narily one drink or two-for the sake of
conviviality - sufficed him but to-night
he was upset by his interview with kath-
erine and her outrageous behavior he
sensed a new wild lawlessness about her
that he did not comprehend-and it wor-
ried him to offset his depression he filled
his glass again and again once muriel
coleman laid her hand warningly on his
arm as he was about to raise his glass to
his lips and gazed somewhat reproachfully
and very wistfully into his eyes it hurt
her that he should have chosen just this
occasion to take too much because her
father was of the party and she valued the
older mans good opinion of jack but
having had more than was good for him
by that time jack resented her interfer-
ence and with a scowl drank it off

 i know what im about he said
please dont bother about me muriel
after that she said no more but she
watched him anxiously as he grew more
and more morose

  there are some men who grow happier
the more they drink there are others who
grow uglier and jack was of this second
sort he began to brood over katherines

                          	a
the dance of death



independence her devilish recklessness
he began to watch for da costa and when
the dancer did not come back thought his
absence suspicious and wondered what was
afoot guessing that in some way katherine
was responsible it did not occur to him
of course that da costa was dead he
simply missed him - and watched kath-
erine fearing lest she meant to slip away
too to join her lover and perhaps put her
threat into execution-perhaps elope he
knew that he was powerless to stop her if
that was indeed her intention but he meant
to do his utmost meanwhile as she passed
from one man to the next his eyes followed
her restlessly

  he missed garry carpenter and won-
dered what had become of him-whether
he too was involved in da costas disap-
pearance that there was something up
he felt certain he felt it in the air

   wheres garry he asked finally
when katherine came back to the table at
the end of her third dance with rob
stewart

   i dont know tete-a-teting some-
where no doubt with that brazen little
flapper in pink she answered lightly

   i havent seen him in a long time
funny since he came with us

    rude i call it said muriel

   do you think he can have gone
asked jack

   gone gone home you mean cried
katherine  but he couldnt have you
know no one can-until daybreak 

    i can answered jack kendall grimly
 whenever i take the notion you dont
think anybody can keep me here against
my will do you

   but it was understood when we came
nobody is to leave before dawn said
katherine

    rot cried jack  ill go if i like-
and ive a good mind to go now what
do you say sir got enough of all this
he added turning to old mr coleman

    i have responded the old man  not
that i want to hurry you young people
but whenever youre ready im ready
he smiled around at them katherine
began to tremble her heart was beating
wildly

     a

   what do you say muriel shall we
go asked jack

  you can go if you like said katherine
calmly  but i said id stay until dawn and
i will stay until dawn thats that

   come-dont be childish said muriel
and in a lower tone added  jacks had
much too much to drink we ought to get
him home and to bed if we can

   i shall not go until the doors are
opened at dawn repeated katherine

  she knew she could not go even if she
wished she knew silvers would never per-
mit her to leave but the others guessing
nothing of this looked upon her determi-
nation as willfulness

   not even for my sake asked old mr
coleman  i am not as young as you my
dear and i confess im a little tired and
very bored

   you go then by all means if theyll
let you out you all go urged katherine

 there are dozens of men here wholl look
after me be glad to

  she smiled at jack

  go along jack she said her eyes
suddenly lighting mischievously

  he smothered an oath

    little devil  he growled  youre too
anxious to get us out of the wray youre
up to something im damned if ill leave
you here-not to-night we all go or none
of us goes

   we stay then said katherine dim-
pling

  her heart ached for poor old mr cole-
man who really did look tired but she
could not go if she attempted it she
knew there would be trouble with silvers
-a row perhaps with jack in his ugliest
humor-a scene-and everything that gar-
ry was trying to do would be rendered use-
less so she powdered her nose and rouged
her lips and went off with stuyvie nettle-
ton-though she felt she must drop if she
had to go on dancing

  and behind at her table her brother
muttered grimly

   little devil she has no heart

  silvers looked at his watch as he mount-
ed the stairs to confront fielding it was
a quarter past two


argosy-allstory weekly

    well be asked gruffly  wheres car-
 penter

    i left him behind at the apartment
open this and ill tell you what happened
answered fielding

   silvers opened the door to the little
french drawing-room again and they
passed in

    well cried silvers again

    read those said fielding handing
him katherines letters

   he looked from them to fielding curi-
 ously and began to read his little eyes
 lighted feverishly but he said nothing
 until he had read them all then-

    so he said  the little kendall girl
 after all eh id never have believed it-
 and yet-you never can tell women are
 like that soft as silk on top and hell
 underneath well

   fielding faced him

    we read those letters back there in da
 costas apartment he said in a low voice
  carpenter was all for destroying them
 without any one elses seeing them but i
 wouldnt stand for it we had a scrap--
 and i left him locked up there and brought
 them theyre yours to use in any way
 you see fit but theres one condition
 youve got to let joan and me beat it now
 and no one is to mention that we were here
 at all

   silvers frowned

   but no one was to get out before
dawn 

    hell i was out cried fielding  and
 no one  miss joan we can sneak by the
 same way that we went before anyway
 thats the condition its either that or i
 tear up the letters

   he confronted silvers grimly

    all right said silvers

   after all it was all one to him whether
 joan got off free or was held for the mur-
 der ah he cared about was that somebody
 should be held in fact if it turned out to
 be katherine kendall the result might be
 distinctly to his advantage there was
 plenty of kendall money-enough to keep
 the whole thing pretty quiet murder cases
 had been hushed up in new york before
 but if joan turned out to be guilty-she
 would certainly stand trial and there would

 be publicity-scandal-talk it would cer-
 tainly be the end of the king of clubs
 with the evidence all against katherine-
 he had at least a chance

    ill send for her immediately he said
 finally

    no ill send said fielding and he
 went to the foot of the stairs and asked
 charlie to tell miss olcott that mr field-
 ing wanted a wrord with her when she
 appeared he spoke the word it was
  come 

   silvers opened the door for them behind
 the mirror that swung outwrard and they
 slipped away fielding leading down the
 iron steps joan holding up her heavy fur
 wrap as she went and downstairs in the
 supper room katherine danced unaware
 of the abyss that was opening before her
 tiny feet

chapter xv

bound gagged and unconscious

when fielding tied garry up fast in
the heavy portiere cords and aban-
doned him unconscious on the
floor of da costas bedchamber he felt
that for some hours to come that individual
would be in no position to interfere further
with his plans

   but one so often reckons what may trans-
 pire without taking destiny into considera-
 tion i call it destiny some men call it fate
 some men call it luck but all men have
 in mind the same strange combination of
 events over which one has no control-the
 seemingly inexplicable bringing together of
 individuals who meet inevitably to influ-
 ence one anothers lives

   we seem to exercise free will in making
 our decisions in our words and deeds-
 and yet sometimes long afterward we arc
 able to trace back the sequence of events
 and wre find that what we have said or done
 has been brought about by something that
 we or some one else has said or done-and
 so on backward until the whole thing forms
 a complete and connected whole-a pattern
 easily discerned and all this does not re-
 lieve us of any responsibility at all but
 gives tremendous weight and importance to
the dance of death



 even the slightest things we do or say one
 never knows from what insignificant begin-
 ning great developments will grow

   so fielding fleeing from da costas
 apartment took no account of the woman
 whose small and very smart town car was
 at that very moment approaching the en-
 trance indeed if he had noticed the car
 he probably would not have seen the wom-
 an herself swathed in chinchilla crouching
 nervously in the farther corner for she
 was attempting to attract as little attention
 as possible but if he had seen her he
 would certainly have recognized her and
 he might have changed his plans every
 one at all familiar with the world of so-
 ciety knew her by sight for even in this
 day of changing orders and war fortunes
 her financial and social standing remained
 unchanged

    no other woman of her importance
   would have ventured to drive to da costas
   rooms in her own car but this woman real-
   ized the futility and the danger of attempt-
   ing subterfuge and disguise her system
   was to disarm suspicion by acting openly

       the uniformed attendants in the hallway
      bowed low before her and assured her that
      she was expected with a smile and a gra-
      cious little nod of her head she crossed to
      the lift and mounted to da costas floor

       the elevator descended immediately
     after she stepped out she drew a latchkey
     from her hand bag and let herself in

         finding the lights on she advanced slow-
       ly and looked about her

        guy are you there she called
     softly

        her voice was soft and low and charm-
        ingly modulated but it echoed strangely
        in the empty rooms she sensed something
        out of the ordinary somewhere and felt
        suddenly unaccountably nervous recall-
        ing what the servants had said about her
        being expected she wondered deep with-
        in her there stirred that distrust of da
        costa that she had always so firmly sup-
        pressed she was aware that her position
        here was a precarious one her presence
        here could not be satisfactorily explained
        discovery meant destruction-swift com-
        plete appalling she had known that from
        the very beginning but weary of the mo-

  notony of her days-the dreary waste of
  her life-the emptiness of it-she had taken
  the risk of course there were moments of
  weakness-qualms but they were always

  afterward

  she stood motionless listening but
  there was no sound it occurred to her
  that da costa may have left the lights on
  for her although this was not his custom

  and in any case certainty she felt would
  be better than this suspense

     she crossed the room slowly to the bed-
  chamber and looked in and with a gasp
  of dismay she drew back staring at the man
  on the floor she recognized him at first
  glance

    garret carpenter bound and uncon-
  scious-on the floor in da costas rooms
  what did it mean

  she advanced and bent over him fear-
  fully but he still lived she unfastened
  his bonds with swift steady fingers and
  lifted his head he opened his eyes-
  vaguely-and looked at her he seemed
  not to recognize her at once

      garry she cried anxiously what
     is it what has happened are you ill
     he still stared-with a slight frown-
     knitted brows he was making a terrific
     effort to regain control of his faculties

        louise he said finally recognizing
     her

        he spoke with difficulty his mouth was
     dry and he was conscious of an unpleasant
     nausea

         yes said the woman

        his eyes wandered around the room

          oh he cried then as realization swept
      over him  fielding is he gone

        i dont know i think so there
       seems to be no one else here you were
       tied up and i released you

         it was good of you said garry strug-
        gling to smile  in return i shall release

you too

   release me she repeated thinking
that his mind was wandering

    yes he said  from the toils of the

   serpent

   she grew paler he raised himself slow-
   ly and held his head

    oh he groaned again

    you are ill she cried


argosy allstory weekly

   not really he stuck me with some-
thing a drug i think my head is whirl-
ing-and i feel a little upset ill be all
right in a minute i think how long have
you been here

   i just came-scarcely five minutes
ago

  u what time is it now

  she looked at her wrist watch set with
diamonds

   two oclock said louise

   a m he asked

   yes

   thank god i have only been  out 
a few minutes then theres still a lot of
time

  he leaned back with a sigh she brought
him a pillow and placed it under his head

   thanks said garry and then shook
his head at her  isnt life extraordi-
nary he said  i dont know any one
id least prefer to see here than you-and
yet - youve probably saved me - and
others-as well as yourself by coming just
now as you did 

   i dont understand exactly said
louise

   no he said  you couldnt possibly
im going to tell you

  he drew a long breath and steeled him-
self for the effort

   da costa has been murdered he said
 murdered she repeated she had
fallen into a low chair near the bed she
leaned forward now her hands clenched
on the arms of the chair and she went
white to the lips her dark eyes stared
out at him in terror  my god she
whispered hoarsely my god

   stabbed by some one - identity un-
known-in a little retiring room at the
king of clubs to-night went on garry
 in order to save all sorts of scandal i
induced the proprietor - nat silvers - to
let me search out the murderer before he
notified the police by some lucky chance
da costa himself had arranged that the
opening celebration at the cafe should last
all night to-night and that no one should
be permitted to leave before daylight-so
we know that the guilty person is there and
cant get out until the doors are opened
 but you- she broke in swiftly

   came here with young moffat fielding
to look for evidence we found some let-
ters

    whose letters she asked in a whisper

    katherine kendalls

   oh there was relief as well as com-
prehension in the sound

   i wanted to destroy them fielding
didnt he struck me with a hypodermic
needle i think ad then-tied me up here
while he went back with the letters they
must never be made public they seem to
incriminate katherine--and you know-
we all know-it would be impossible for
her to kill any one

  the woman opposite him lay back look-
ing very tired her dark lashes hid her
eyes

   she has been madly infatuated with
him she said  and jealous of me so
jealous that i have had to come-like this
-secretly-at night-to see him at all
one never knows what a woman will do-
under certain circumstances we-we have
no sense of honor you know-no scruples
-no morals or ethics i am afraid the
worst and the best of us we are all alike
really only some are braver than others
all of us - we have only feeling - emo-
tions

   garry sat up and stared at her

   do you mean you think it might have
been katherine he asked

   why not-if he goaded her sufficient-
ly he knew how to handle women it
might have been katherine it might even
have been i

   and there never lived a woman more
perfectly poised you must admit - more
perfectly mistress of herself she added
 yet there have been moments when i
could have wrung his neck in my two
hands he had the faculty of arousing the
worst in us-the most violent-elemental
things you see my dear garry your con-
ception of love is the conventional civil-
ized conception but women are noj civil-
ized we do not think men think
women only feel and da costa had a
way of swaying us to our depths and at
the veryr foundation you know love is not
very far removed from hate especially
when jealousy enters in
the dance of death



   he was shaken by this calm woman in
 the chair-shaken by her weary manner of
 repeating things as though they were old
 old truths-shaken by her resignation and
 her despair it was not that she gave any
 indication of her grief he felt it there
 was no sign of it anywhere about her

   no no he cried protestingly i
 cant believe she did it-i cant its too
 monstrous to pick up a knife on the floor
 below and carry it up there with her-to
 face him - to strike - driving it into his
 throat with such force she couldnt have
 she couldnt have

   the woman opposite shrugged

     she could she corrected him patient-
 ly  but perhaps she didnt there were
 plenty of others who might just as easily
 have done it

    if you could only name them
 breathed garry eagerly  im sure kath-
 erine is innocent i believe in her and
 i must save her if you could only help
 me if you could only name me one who
 had reasons to kill him-and the desire to
 just one

    she smiled and opened her eyes he was
 startled at the cold gleam in them

     yes she said  i can name you one
 who not only had the motive and the wish
 -but who even swore to do it

    who was it cried garry  tell
 me

    my husband said the woman oppo-
 site  and he was at the king of clubs
 to-night

chapter xvi

he must pay the penalty

 garry stood staring incredulously

  your husband threatened da
 costas life-and he was at the king
 of clubs to-night he repeated brushing
 one hand nervously through his hair

 she remained quite calm-curiously
 calm

  yes she said

 then he is still there

  yes no one was to leave before dawn
 guy planned that trick especially to keep
 him there-while we kept tryst here he

  was to come back immediately after his
  dance was finished

   so that was why he planned the all-
night-long session

   yes my husband had been growing
suspicious lately he had begun to suspect
me of being too interested in guy i dare-
say gossip had reached his ears at any
rate-i had had a few unpleasant scenes
with him when he is drunk he is not a
very amiable person but you know him
dont you

   yes answered garry nodding

   one can endure scenes that are caused
because somebody loves one and is jealous
there is even something gratifying in them
-flattering to ones vanity but when
scenes are caused just because of wounded
pride they are distinctly annoying you
see george has never really cared for me
you know there has been a succession
of mistresses he has made no effort to
conceal that fact from me although of
course i should have found out even if he
had the social sheets nowadays keep one
informed

  garry nodded again

   he didnt love me but he didnt want
me to have any other lover he married
me because he thought the match a suitable
one and that i would make a worthy suc-
cessor to his mother-a worthy mother to
his children but i never had any chili
dren my life has been empty i have
tried for years to find contentment in my
charitable works-my social duties and ob-
ligations but such things are poor substi-
tutes and all the while george was find-
ing life very agreeable indeed so when
i met guy i felt no compunction in hold-
ing the marriage ties as lightly as george
holds them i decided that i owed him no
greater consideration or loyalty than he has
given me he could not see things that
way he soon heard of my acquaintance
with guy and demanded that i give guy
up i refused we had a succession of
really quite melodramatic scenes culmina-
ting in a climax to-night i told him that
i was going to leave him and go away with
guy

   you told him that to-night
  u yes said the woman quietly  at dint


argosy-allstory weekly

ner youve dined with us you know
our long narrow table well george was
at the head of it and i at the foot-alone
together-miles apart or so it seemed
there were servants of course in attend-
ance-and george respects and fears ser-
vants he is terrified of their tongues so
when-in the intervals that we were alone
-i told him calmly that i was going to
leave him and go away with guy he was
powerless he would have liked to strangle
me but he dared not the servants were
within call he would have liked to rant
and swear and smash things but he was
afraid of what the servants would say he
is a slow-thinking man-george he end-
ed by leaning fonvard and hissing at me in
a whisper  if you do that ill kill the fel-
low and swear that i struck him down in
defense of my home they always acquit
one for that i think george is probably
the only man who could think of avenging
his honor and saving his skin at the same
identical moment

   she smiled

    but surely he was not in earnest pro-
tested garry

    oh yes indeed he was he is just
the type of man who would mean it-who
would do it too you know him garret
-thick-necked heavy stolid vicious with
no saving sense of humor god defend me
from men without a sense of humor and
then - his tremendous ego - his colossal
vanity he would infinitely prefer to shed
blood-somebody elses blood-than to cut
a poor figure in the public eye and he
resented my preferring guy to him he
would not have had the world know it-
or anything

    and he is at the king of clubs to-
night

    yes-most likely with his latest mis-
tress he adores showing them off at such
places it makes him seem so awfully
wicked you must have seen him dancing
with them i have myself a few times
he always has them beautifully turned out
and hung with diamonds poor things
he never keeps them long i have always
pitied them they earn whatever they get
from him he must bore them frightfully
hes so dull

   garry felt underneath this calm cynical
 exterior the womans terrific feeling-knew
 that she was maintaining her composure
 only because it had become second nature
 to her to do so-because it was her tradi-
 tion not to yield-because generations of
 breeding had bestowed upon her this per-
 fect poise he wondered how she had ever
 come to marry such a man-in spite of his
 millions his importance she must have
 been so lovely-before her first freshness
 had gone-her features were still fine and
 she had that distinction of bearing that
 perfect grooming that is rarer and more
 precious than mere physical prettiness

    well she said slowly rising  i have
 given you my testimony it is for you to
 follow it up all i can add is this if
 george killed him-if you can succeed in
 making that fact clear-he shall not escape
 punishment on that point i am deter-
 mined i believe there is something in the
 law which prevents a wife from testifying
 against her husband-but if i must divorce
 him to do it-i will go on the stand and
 tell the truth about this i will tell just
 what george has made of my life-how
 he has neglected me-flaunted his disgrace-
 ful affairs in my face-humiliated me-de-
 nied me affection and children-and i will
 repeat under oath what he said to me at
 dinner- i will kill him and swear that i
 struck in defense of my home -in defense
 of his home-think of it- because they
 always acquit one for that  

    youre not in earnest cried garry
  you couldnt appear against your hus-
 band in your lovers defense

    it is the only thing i can do now-
for guy she said

    but you will be publicly disgraced-
 reviled - ostracized public opinion will
  be against you

   she shrugged

    public opinion she murmured grimly
  who cares can public opinion give me
 happiness can it give me peace of mind
 can it cure the ache in my heart damn
 public opinion

   he laid his hand on her arm

    you are upset now he said gently
  excited laboring under a great strain
 this affair has been a shock to you go
the dance of death



 home and rest-and think it all over very
 carefully before you decide upon any course
 of action after all it cannot aid guy if
 your husband pays the death penalty

     but it is ustl she cried  he has
 had his own way so long-in everything

 he has ridden rough-shod over so many

 if he has killed guy not his influence nor
 his money-nothing shall save nim he
 must pay the penalty

      well said garry slowly  that is your
 problem-for you to decide i must get
 back to katherine

      ill go with you said the woman

     hadnt you better go home and rest

     i have no home  have had my things
 packed and sent to the station my maids
 have been packing since dinner time i
 have some hand luggage and my maid at
 an hotel

     go there then and go to bed get
 some sleep ill telephone you or drop in
 and see you as soon as anything definite
 is known

     i couldnt sleep she replied with a
    shake of her head  take me back with
    you i want to be where everything is go-
    ing on-where guy is

        very well he agreed finally

      her car was waiting-the car in which
    she had meant to carry da costa off they
    drove back to the club and they arrived
    at the foot of the iron stairway just as
    fielding and joan reached it coming down

        go back  cried garry quietly barring
     their way

      they halted at that in some dismay
    and fielding muttered an oath under his
    breath

        if you dont want trouble with the po-
    lice-go back i tell you repeated garry

     its not going to look well you know-
    your sneaking off like this it looks pretty
    much like a confession of guilt 

       damn you growled fielding  i
      thought i put you out

         not quite answered garry  im
      still on the job you see-and i advise you
      to stick you wont get far i warn you
      before the police will be on your trail bet-
      ter wait around

          i agree with him moffie i think wed
       better put in joan

    all right agreed fielding with small
 grace they turned and retraced their
 steps garry followed them the woman
 with him brought up the rear they had
 had no chance to see her distinctly down
 there in the dark but when they reached
 the top again and knocked on the door-
 and when it swung back under silverss
 guiding hand the light fell full upon her-
 and they stared in blank amazement

    mrs milburne gasped silvers
 with a low bow ushered her in

     the grandeur of the past

     he day of permanent aristocracies is
  past even in the older countries
  over seas the peasant classes are no
  longer willing to toil in order to support a
  class of idlers and wasters dukes and
  earls are going to work countesses are
  opening shops and going into the motion
  pictures and it is impossible to work for
  a living and still play the society game
  the society game requires a good deal of
  time besides the round of teas and din-
  ners and balls there are the races the sea-
  sonal resorts the shooting parties and house
  parties and hunts it costs a fortune too
  to maintain establishments indeed social
  position cannot endure without funds-
  more funds nowadays than ever before
  and money is harder come by in this age
  so even over seas the game of society is
  pretty nearly played out in the united
  states of america it has practically disap-
  peared fortunes are made and lost so
  rapidly over here values are always
  changing everything is always changing
  for new peoples are constantly coming in
  at ellis island with new ideas new ambi-
  tions and a burning desire to achieve and
  conquer

      yesterdays immigrant grows softer to-
    day as he rises above the necessity to do
    hard labor to-morrow he will be well off
    sending his sons and daughters to colleges
    and smart schools and as they rise in the
    social scale they will become less able to
    compete with the newcomers who are more
    hardened who have yet to win place the

 order is always changing to-days mil-
 lionaires grown fat and gullible fall into the
 hands of to-morrows millionaires who are
 still hard and shrewd just as the sons of
 to-morrows millionaires will fall into the
 hands of the immigrants or their sons who
 are landing to-day they come they work
 they rise they fall

   the great town mansions are tom down
 to leave room for office buildings and the
 men who build the office buildings build
 new mansions in another section the fifth
 avenue families of yesterday are gone their
 names almost forgotten the park avenue
 families of to-day engage the public eye in
 restaurants and opera boxes by way of
 palm beach and paris and london new
 aspirants appear to-day to shine for an
 hour and then vanish newport has al-
 ready given way to southampton no
 one nowadays dictates the fashions or says
 who shall and who shall not be  in 
 and these things are natural and fitting in
 a country  for the people by the people 
 there can never be a permanent upper class
 here the places at the top are for those
 who can and want to occupy them
  money  is the password to the magic
 circle

   but time was when the old families-
 chiefly the old families of dutch stock-
 had most of the big fortunes in new york
 and formed society in those days the
 milburnes rose to prominence and by
 amazingly shrewd investments and clever
 alliances they managed to hold their place
 long after the older families had drifted
 into oblivion true the milburne fortune
 once enormous was now scarcely a fortune
 at all-as fortunes go nowadays-but the
 milburne name was known far and wide
 young george milburne had been a fa-
 mous spendthrift at college his gambling
 exploits his racing stables had filled much
 space in sunday newspapers in conse-
 quence the milburne name was synony-
 mous with millions the milburne mil-
 lions made such a pleasing phrase that
 was why even at the king of clubs the
 advent of mrs george stuyvesant mil-
 burne created something of a sensation
 for mrs george stuyvesant milburne was
 one of the last of the social celebrities

  not that she was old she was still in
 her early forties but she belonged to the
 days that are past-the pre-war days when
 there was still a four hundred and new-
 port was its stronghold and she managed
 to look less than her years without relin-
 quishing her dignity or grace or charm

   she was no bobbed-haired woman in
 short skirts she was slender and moved
 with ease and lightness her brown hair
 showing yet no trace of gray was smoothly
 coiffed and gleamed like burnished copper
 she was rather pale as women go nowa-
 days and her great gray eyes were the most
 significant feature of her face she dressed
 always in soft clinging things that suited
 her and no one ever stopped to wonder
 whether they conformed to the moments
 styles or not she always looked well and
  smart too and because she was a per-
 sonality she was recognized everywhere for
 what she was no one ever mistook her for
 anything else and this quite regardless
 of the fact that-since her marriage-she
 had been extensively photographed her
 name was known wherever the fashion and
 society periodicals circulate

   at the king of clubs-and the other
 places that silvers had established-george
 stuyvesant milburne was a frequent visi-
 tor a fairly well-known and familiar sight
 but mrs george stuyvesant milburne was
 a stranger indeed accordingly her en-
 trance with garret carpenter astounded
 silvers

    we need not go in there and face the
 crowd need we she asked indicating the
 supper rooms with a little jerk of her head
  isnt there an office-or something

    yes this way said silvers almost
 obsequiously leading

   they all followed him finding them-
 selves presently in a very small very busi-
 nesslike room furnished only with a few
 chairs a few cabinets and a desk on the
 desk was a silver-framed photograph of
 mrs nat silvers and two little silverses
 it was the only human note in the room

     it is quiet here at least said louise
 sinking into the revolving chair by the desk
 with a little sigh

   joan sat opposite rather sulkily she
 had not been exactly ignored by louise
the dance

but then again she had not been especially
noticed or addressed and she was feeling
slightly resentful she observed with sat-
isfaction that her jewels were more expen-
sive and striking than louises and that her
furs were much more luxurious every-
thing about her in fact was  much more
there was some comfort in that

  fielding waited with brooding impa-
tience silvers and garry seemed to be de-
ferring to louise in perfect accord

   will you have some champagne mrs
milburne asked silvers hospitably  we
have some very fine wines even your hus-
band admits that

    george would know admitted louise
grimly and then- yes i think i would
like a glass something quite dry please
and nicely chilled

   silvers delightedly gave the order at the
door

    and you might send for my husband
added louise quietly following him with
her eyes

   silvers called the waiter back and sum-
moned george milburne mrs milburnes
gaze came back then to drift from field-
ings lowering face to joans sullen one

    i dont really think we need detain-
these - er - young people she said  i
hear the music and it sounds delightful i
am sure they will be wanting to dance

    in other words were not wanted said
joan rising  i get you mrs milburne
come moffie lets go

    but only as far as your table cau-
tioned garry  we may have to send for
you again

    all right growled fielding and they
passed out

    that girl-surely ive seen her some-
where with george perhaps asked
louise milburne

    perhaps answered garry

   shes rather pretty said louise
 and the boy

     young moffat fielding i told you
   about him and katherines letters

      ah-yes murmured louise recalling
    i suppose said garry turning to sil-
   vers  he has turned those letters over to
   you now

      i have them-yes admitted silvers

of death	

  youve read them

    yes admitted silvers with some re-
luctance

   and in exchange for them you were
letting fielding go you meant to hold
miss kendall

    well yes admitted silvers his back
against the wall  ive got to hold some-
body and the letters make the case
against miss kendall look pretty bad be-
sides if shes at the bottom of this well
there mightnt be so much fuss raised as
if it had been joan olcott or john smith

   i see you are depending upon the
kendall money and influence you think
if you can get her in the same boat with
you you might save your skin

   something like that nodded silvers
defiantly

   of course self preservation you
know garry you cant blame mr sil-
vers murmured louise and turning
with a smile to the little man she added

 may i see those letters

  he looked distressed and extremely
grieved

   im sorry mrs milburne he said

 but ive got them locked in my safe i
really cant risk losing them rou see i
took a long chance in not calling in the
police as soon as this murder was discov-
ered-and im going to have one hell of a
time squaring myself now-without getting
in any deeper

    i quite understand said louise  i
just wondered if i chanced to be mentioned
in them

  silvers colored and looked at garry
garry nodded

   there is one mention of a woman
named louise said he  but of course
it could not be mrs milburne

    what was the mentionasked louise
 oh katherine writes that she hap-
pened to be passing da costas apartment
at two oclock-going home from the
rainesfords dance - and that she saw
 louise  just coming out

   mrs milburne sat frowning

    i suppose it would be quite impossible
   to-to suppress that one letter she re-
   flected

   yes-quite answered garry


argosy-allstory weekly

yes - quite she repeated and
after all-it doesnt really matter does it
i was in da costas apartment the night of
the rainesfords dance - and many other
nights why deny it after all what is
sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose
is it not my dear george

  her eyes wandered to the doorway
where her husband stood - crimson with
rage he had overheard

chapter xviii

his death shall be avenged

t it  hat are you saying cried
george milburne in a choking
voice  you have been in da
costas apartments-

    many times she finished for him
coolly  come in george and dont ex-
cite yourself we have had scenes enough
what we have to say to one another-all
of us-we can say quietly i am sure we
are more or less intelligent human beings
after all

   he made an effort to control himself
and came in and closed the door behind
him at first hearing her words he forgot
where he was in the wave of rage and hate
that overwhelmed him but now his cau-
tion reasserted itself so he carefully
closed the door behind him and scowled
from his wife to garry and silvers who
were intently regarding him

    you sent for me he asked of them
all

    yes said louise milburne nodding
  do you know why george

    why he asked

    asked you if you knew why she
repeated patiently

   no how should i know

   he was a thickset little man portly
rather than fat kept in condition by turk-
ish baths and golf and what not his hair
was thin his neck was thick he had puffs
under his eyes and very loose sensual lips
half hidden by a neat mustache he was
always immaculate but he never had the
clean well-groomed look his dinner
clothes fitted him rather trimly to give him
some semblance of a figure and he always

 wore a white carnation in the buttonhole
 of his left coat lapel he was renowned
 for that white carnation indeed it had
 got to be rather a joke that he should wear
 white-who was so far from pure in word
 thought or deed an obstinate sclf-cen-
 tered pompous egotistical little man a
 vicious man a dangerous man when he
 could not have his own way once he had
 caned a chauffeur and it had cost a small
 fortune to hush the matter up the chauf-
 feurs arm had been broken at the elbow
 and had remained stiff rendering him unfit
 for further driving and once milburne
 had locked a girl in a cupboard-as a joke
 he explained afterward-and she had been
 rescued hours later-a shrieking gibbering
 wreck he was not quite a nice man but
 he was very rich and when louise gar-
 land had married him - her first season
  out -it had been generally agreed that
 she was  doing well

   she regarded him now as she was wont
 to regard him with rather amused cynical
 half-closed eyes he hated the way she
 looked at him but there was really noth-
 ing one could do about a thing like that

    we sent for you george she said
  to find out what you know about guy da
 costas murder

   he caught his breath and whitened

    murder he repeated his eyes went
 from her curiously searchingly to silverss
 face to garrys then suddenly he chuck-
 led finding confirmation in the expressions
 of the men

    murdered eh he said  thats one
 on you old girl what

    it may prove to be one on you she
 answered suavely

     on me he cried opening his eyes

     perhaps you forget she said  that
 you threatened his life-only to-night at
 dinner

   he frowned

     i was joking he protested  at least
 -you were getting me excited this is a
 hell of a time to bring things like that up
 i must say and anyway-nobody heard
 me but you

    he doesnt deny that he did threaten
 da costas life you understand that
 said louise turning to garry
the dance of death



      garry nodded milburne went livid

        i say-whats the idea of all this he
     gasped with an attempt to recover his dig-
     nity

        the idea is that we are trying to dis-
 i cover who killed guy da costa said
 i garry

       and you suspect me gasped mil-
  burne

        certainly that is a possibility re-
 j joined garry

       in that case said milburne slowly
     i can say nothing further until i have
    consulted with my attorneys

      his eyes wandered to louise and he
 h glared at her with a gleam of hate in them

       however he added  my memory is

 	quite as good as yours my dear and i
 mi shall not forget what you said-also in the
 sh presence of these gentlemen-in regard to
 s your visits to da costas rooms 

        oh if you are thinking of divorce
j sle observed smiling  our lawyers can
 soon come to terms dont think that your

-	j own conduct in the past few years has es-
    u caped my attention-or the attention of
    the detectives i have had following you
    i have quite a little history of your ad-
    ventures in case i should ever be called
    upon to produce them

       he glared at her

        detectives he repeated choking

        yes detectives my dear george she
     responded  i see the prospect of having
     your private life spied upon is an unpleas-
     ant one to a person of your refinement and
     cultivated tastes no doubt you shun pub-
     licity too you poor bungling imbecile
     you fool did you think i would let you
     go on humiliating me indefinitely did
     you think i thrived on your neglect and
     abuse no i only went on living in your
     house because there was no other man i
     wanted and it was simpler to hold my
     place but when i found a man that
     meant more to me-i was ready you
     didnt think you held me all these years
     did you you killed what feeling i had
     for you on our wedding night i have just
     endured you since then god how you
     have disgusted me and bored me and
     how you have amused me too my dear
     george i know it says in the marriage

ceremony  till death us do part but with
a man like you-well one cannot take that
seriously life often parts as well as death
and being loyal to you would be wasting
loyalty one shouldnt waste anything as
fine as that you never wanted a com-
panion-a helpmate-a wife-a mother for
your children you relinquished the right
to have children but  didnt i am a
woman and i deserve whatever is best in
life i was nineteen when i married you
nineteen in my ignorant childish way
i thought i loved you i married you be-
cause i wanted a husband-some one to
take care of me-to guard me and guide
me you wanted only a mate

   and you wanted guy da costa he
sneered

  she winced  yes-now now she
cried but i am no longer the innocent
girl of nineteen that you married i am
what you have made of me i am the result
of years of association with you guy da
costa was kind to me and sweet and sym-
pathetic and he was young-and beauti-
ful-and strong my lost youth cried out
for him he appealed to my imagination
he recalled the dreams i used to dream
before i knew you

  you are shameless roared milburne
enraged

  no ashamed she corrected him
 ashamed of you and of the years ive
endured you and countenanced you but
im through now do you hear
through if youve killed guy-as you
threatened to-youve taken the one thing
from me that i wanted-that i cared about
and youve gone too far im going to see
that youre punished im going to see
that you pay i tell you-and i mean this
-the murderer of guy da costa-whether
it was you or any one else-has got to an-
swer to me

  he stood silent abashed overwhelmed
by her fury which was greater than his
own all three men regarded her with
something like awe-this stern dominating
woman - demanding justice and spurning
deceit or disguise or subterfuge regard-
less of public opinion or marriage laws
she loved guy da costa and she acknowl-
edged it with head held high and she de-


argosy-allstory weekly

dared herself the champion of his cause
the pity of it was that she should have
thrown away such a passion upon a worth-
less scamp like da costa the world is so
full of finer men but somehow they rarely
arouse a woman to such a pitch of feeling
it is very strange

    you dont mean to make public all
this asked george milburne finally
there was an agony of anxiety and appeal
in his voice now he was facing a force
with which he and the milburne millions
could not cope

    yes all of it she answered  i dont
 care who suffers or goes down his death
 shall be avenged

    but whats the use protested mil-
burne  im sure to be acquitted i only
threatened-i didnt really kill him youd
need more proof than that to send me to
the chair-convenient as that might be to
you and you cant produce any proof
ive been with mable all the evening i
havent left her once you can easily veri-
fy that and if you go in for all this pub-
licity-what  happen to you afterward
wherell you live wholl be able to know
you

   she shrugged

    it is useless for you to argue she said
  my mind is made up at any cost-im
 going to get to the bottom of this and see
 that the murderer pays

    god what a position for me gasped
 milburne breaking out into cold perspira-
 tion

    we might send for mable-and ques-
tion her suggested garry suddenly

    she could be paid to furnish him an
alibi answered louise

    but no one has had time to prompt
her or bribe her objected silvers

    the murderer has - if he came pre-
pared to do the thing she reminded them
 all that could have been arranged before-
hand you dont know george he has
no brains but he has a certain canny
shrewdness especially where his own per-
sonal comfort and safety are concerned
 but i tell you i didnt do thisl  cried
milburne  i had no reason to bribe ma-
ble in fact i didnt even want to kill da
costa-afterward

  afterward after ivhal asked

 louise

    after i left the house and joined ma-
 ble she told me what da costa was real-
 ly up to and i was so tickled to think you
 were being double-crossed that i wanted to
 see the thing through and have the laugh
 on you

   double-crossed repeated garry
louise merely stared

   yes it seems mable knew all about
it he told her and she told me-in con-
fidence of course da costa was planning
to leave my dear wife flat and elope with
katherine kendall

    its not true whispered louise going
 white to the ups

    if you dont believe me ask mable
 said milburne triumphantly

   louise turned to garry

    send for mable she said

chapter xix

the man who stopped bleeding

bartlett recovered consciousness
slowly to find himself still lying across
his table among the china and glass-
ware and crumpled flowers thanks to the
protection afforded by the surrounding
palms to the loud beat and thump and
swing of the music his collapse had re-
mained undiscovered silverss well-trained
waiters were not in the habit of hovering
too near the patrons of his resorts pre-
ferred not to be disturbed so bartlett was
able to right himself cautiously unseen-to
wet his dry mouth with champagne and
lean back as though nothing had happened
his first thought was for the wound in his
side it had stopped bleeding

   a little cry of satisfaction escaped his
 lips as he realized this-a warm glow of
 triumph suffused him

  if the wound had stopped bleeding he
had still a good chance to escape he put
from him all thought of exonerating the
woman they suspected time enough to
think of that later-if she was actually
threatened with the death penalty but he
told himself that women seldom were

   true there was still the blood stain on
the dance of death



his shirt that must be hidden his coat
and waistcoat no longer covered it as
long as he could keep the napkin before
him he was safe but how was he going to
cross the floor he must wait until the
rest had gone he must pretend he had
fallen asleep in any case he would be
stronger then he felt that he might risk
a little more champagne now and as lie
sipped it he looked about him

  he saw the red-haired girl mable leave
her partner as garry cut in and a mo-
ment later he saw them leave the floor he
recalled that red-haired girl she was-
she had been da costas dancing partner
so they must be sending for her now he
looked at his watch ten minutes to three
only an hour or so till daybreak

  he smiled

  if he won he told himself he would go
to da costas funeral and take a last look
at him before they laid him away forever
forever that was a strange thought
his career ended for good and all but it
was no great loss to civilization and he
had been an opponent-an enemy was
it not a duel they were fighting-even now

  he remembered that murderers always
haunt the vicinity of their victims or the
scene of the crimes but he could not deny
himself the satisfaction of attending the
funeral whether it was a risk or not he
owed himself that much

  his eye followed the whirling colors on
the dance floor it was kaleidoscopic-be-
wildering-fascinating all swirling yellows
and greens and blues and lavenders reds
and silvers and golds and blacks and whites
and through the smoky-blue air strange ex-
otic perfumes drifted to his nostrils he
drank them in and the music thrummed
and beat and moaned and sobbed and
sighed with passionate abandon this was
life-lived to the utmost and upstairs
wtas death

  odd how his mind wandered he had
never thought much about death before
it was just the end of things the nights
rest after a long day but that was the
death that came gently and kindly to man
in the twilight of his years not death as
da costa had met it-struggling painfully
--crying eat in fear he scorned da costa

for that one who had lived so boldly
should have died boldly-with a laugh on
his lips that was bartletts creed he
told himself that if the dead man won the
duel and his crime were traced home to
him-if he were tried and convicted and
sentenced to the chair he would show them
how nonchalantly how indifferently how
carelessly a man could die for him the
great going out had no terrors he rather
anticipated it as a new and strange adven-
ture for if there were nothing - what
matter he woud never know and if
there were another life to live well he
surely could not find it less interesting than
he had found this it was all in the way
you looked at things-all in the way you
played the game himself he had never
been a poor loser he had always been a
sport he scorned a quitter or a welcher
or a coward

  every man has his own philosophy of
life whether it is formulated in words or
not every man has his own creed bart-
letts creed was- play the game and
he was playing it now with every ounce of
strength that there was in him

  and the dancer danced and the orches-
tra played and men and women flirted and
laughed and whispered together each was
intent upon his own affairs nobody else
in the room even noticed harry bartlett

  katherine stole a glance at her tiny
wrist-watch set in diamonds-and noted the
time too and calculated swiftly how much
longer her martyrdom would last her
martyrdom was this really the worst
that she must suffer it seemed to her now
that she could endure nothing more yet
she knew that one never realizes how much
one can bear until the necessity arises
from somewhere deep within us new reser-
voirs of endurance are tapped if garry
should fail-and they should actually ar-
rest her-she would face the outcome
bravely there would simply be nothing
else for her to do

  in her early girlhood she had wept over
the french revolution and the brave care-
less laughing singing aristocrats who had
mounted the guillotine so airily but now
as she danced close-close against young


argosy-allstry weekly

colemans breast her cheek on his after
the fashion of the day she contemplated
the possibility of mounting the steps of
gray stone to that dreadful chair fitted
with straps and bands of steel would she
have courage for that

  it was like some weird nightmare-this
vision of herself paying the supreme pen-
alty for murder it was so unlikely a
thing to befall her-katherine kendall
and now it was threatening her the
shadow of it was already looming large
hours had passed and still garry had not
come to tell her she was free and only
seventy minutes more remained seventy
minutes more of this and then-what

  policemen the tombs or home
again-her lovely gray-walled room with
its hangings of turquoise blue-her maid
yawning by the fire - her dressing table
with its gold-topped bottles its gold-backed
mirror and brushes its gold-framed photo-
graphs her white fur mules and chiffony
peignoir her blossomy bed with its silken
coverlets and dozens of soft embroidered
pillows oh the security of that room as
she visualized it now oh the sweet se-
renity of it-the tranquillity the quiet re-
served respectability ox it would she go
back there and be free to stop smiling-to
rest-to sleep and forget

  tears welled up into her eyes she
dropped her thick lashes hastily and bit
her lip and buried her face against young
colemans shoulder clinging to him in-
stinctively because he was big and strong

  the music swelled in crescendo the mu-
sicians were singing to lend added stimulus
to the dance

    oh do it aain

   i may say no no no no n-ol

   but do it again

  my lips just ache to have you take the kiss
  thats waiting for you-

  you know if you do you
  wont regret it come and get it

   oh no one is near

   i may say  oh oh oh oh o-kl

   but no one will hear

   ma-ma may scold me cause she told me

  that its naughty-but then-

   do it again please do it again

  it ended with a crash and the couples
applauded violently partly because they

were not weary of dancing yet partly be-
cause the song-which had been sung by a
famous french artiste-had caught on and
was tremendously popular the french
artiste had sung it gorgeously - but very
naughtily the modern young revelers
laughed delightedly over it and hummed
the haunting tune themselves as the orches-
tra began the encore

  katherine thought of garry they had
been together at one of carson winslowes
famous sunday night parties the first time
they had heard it the composer had
played it and sung it himself-and the fa-
mous french artiste who had happened to
be present too had cried out impulsively
 i mus ave that song you ear i
mus ave that damned song

  garry had not liked it he had ap-
plauded with the rest of course and smiled
-but katherine had seen by the expression
in his eyes that he had not liked it and
she had been a bit amused at such mid-
victorianism in him now she saw him in
quite another light he was so safe and
sane and fine if she had only realized
then what her escapade with da costa
would cost her if she had only thought
it out for herself they were all head-
ing for hell she saw it now she saw it
plainly only destruction could be the
goal of all this the music barbaric pas-
sionate insinuating vile-appealing to the
lowest in one the small close room gar-
rishly decorated the dim lights the
heavy scent of flowers mingling with the
more exotic scents of the womens per-
fumes the smoke of cigarettes and cigars
the lowered voices the rustle of chiffons
the flash of jewels and bare arms and backs
and bosoms it was hideous-indecent-
depraved she saw it all-as for the first
time only death and destruction could
come out of such a place

   youre quiet said young coleman
smiling down at her and holding her closer
 are you happy

  happy

  youd be surprised she answered
slangily but with significance

  and the jazz went on jazz jazz

and many other withouts too numerous to
keep track of

   oliver endured but the strain was great
 this frugality was grinding his nerves to
 shreds vie on the contrary retained her
 buoyancy of spirit she never let down
 at least not in his presence she met him
 with a smile and sent him off in the morning
 with a kiss she treated their providence
 as a lark

    theres no need going to extremes
protested oliver mildly as he departed on
the daily quest  were not altogether
broke you know he took her smiling
face in his hands and kissed her lovingly
 if i could only hit upon a good proposi-
tion-an investment-i feel sure samuel
wellington would go in or back me

    it wont hurt us to ease up on our
menu she replied fixing his tie as she
spoke  youre too fat anyway and if
i should lose ten pounds i could get back
into those summer things of mine

   she waved to him from the back porch as
 he turned the corner to catch the street car

   the telephone rang mrs samuel wel-
lington was on the wire she wished to
know if mr and mrs steele would dine
with them that evening at their new home
on the hill vie accepted with alacrity
she was delighted with the invitation and
knew that her husband would be too

    thats fine said mrs wellington
 ill send my new car for you at seven

   mrs samuel wellington was always get-
 ting something new-even husbands-and
 her whole life seemed to be devoted to show-
 ing off her latest acquisitions to her less
 favored acquaintances

   it was not so much of a coincidence that
 this bid to dinner should come so quickly
 on the heels of olivers reference to the wel-
 lington family as it might appear for vie
 had been working toward just such social
 intimacy for several months she wanted
 to bring her husband and successful samuel
 wellington into closer contact and her
 crafty little scheme appeared to be bearing
 fruit

   she dressed and regarded herself in the
 mirror some one had once said that she
 could look good in anything but as she
 spied her shadow on this particular morn-

 ing she was ready to doubt the sincerity of
 the compliment her clothes were chic
 enough and not altogether out of style but
 her hat was downright frowzy it was an
 abomination a positive crime

   she was ready to suffer the crudest hard-
 ships of poverty like a true martyr and
 even die in the cause of a necessary econ-
 omy but that hat was too much to bear
 it was the straw that spilled her cup of
 misery and she burst into tears as she re-
 garded the terrible thing on her pretty head

   then she sat down took her chin in her
 hand sniffed thoughtfully and began to
 reason

  ollie was out of work-true enough
they were without an income-that was a
fact but there were other things to con-
sider that visit to the wellingtons was
the important thing her husband must
make an impression on the promoter but
how could he hope to do so tagged by a
wife in a frowzy hat her appearance
might have everything to do with ollies op-
portunity could she afford to place his
chances in jeopardy

   she could not

   she left the apartment like a shot out of
 a rifle taking along the market bag as she
 went for ollie might be home to lunch and
 she had nothing in the icebox her market-
 ing consumed less than three minutes-a
 minute for the soup meat a minute for the
 carrots a minute to pay and depart on the
 more consequential aspect of her journey

   she came soon enough to the most ex-
clusive millinery shop in town it was pre-
sided over by mme selma the lady with
the expressive shoulders a plain velvet
headpiece was finally decided upon for two
sensible reasons it was becoming to vies
type of beauty and it was the cheapest ar-
ticle bearing selmas trade-mark the price
was fifteen dollars

    it ees positeevely scandalous to sell him
 for so leetle monies mme selma com-
 plained impatiently  but i am in zee great
 haste to keep my appointment with zat
 handsome coiffeur so i sacrifice him

   vie was in haste too she got home as
 swiftly as a street car would take her there
 tossing the market bag on the kitchen table
 she gave her immediate attention to the

                          	a
with a wink



   contents of the big round gold-and-blue
 striped box which she had placed carefully
 on the lounge

    taking the velvet form as a foundation
 she twisted it and patted it and smoothed
 it until she got it to her liking then delv-
 ing into a dresser drawer she drew forth two
 magnificent ostrich plumes these weie not
 ordinary plumes one was white the other
 black and any woman would have been
 proud to own them they had come as a
 birthday present from her brother douglas
 who worked on an ostrich farm in cali-
 fornia her husband was ignorant of her
 possession of them she had kept them a
 secret to flash on him in just such a situa-
 tion as the present one

   she worked swiftly surely artistically
 and the result was as a chrysalis blossoming
 into a dazzling butterfly

   vie was elated an experienced designer
 would have envied such a creation adjust-
 ing it to her snow-white brow she observed
 the effect and smiled what a difference
 a becoming hat made in a womans appear-
 ance how mrs wellingtons eyes would
 water in its way the feathered prize was
 as fine an achievement as a new car a new
 maid a new house or a new husband to
 be inelegant but expressive it was a knock-
 out

   vie put the newly trimmed hat back in its
 box and pushed the box under the end of
 her bed

   then came a diversion the scare flew
 through the neighborhood on the lips of a
 small boy eager to be the first to tell the
 news

    mrs jellicos houses been robbed of
 all its silverware he shouted lustily as
 windows were flung open and heads thrust
 out along the street nor did he pause with
 details he made a paul revere dash of it

   as mrs jellico lived but a block away
 and as vie was thoroughly feminine she
 lost no time bolting up her apartment and
 then bolting out of it to learn more of the
 sensation that had so suddenly disturbed the
 quiet of the vicinity

   consequently when oliver steele came in
 shortly afterward tired hungry and disap-
 pointed and found his wife absent his view
 of life was hardly sweetened he went

    a

   through to the kitchen poked his nose into
   the market bag and discovered the bit of
   soup meat and the lone vegetable carrots
   ugh he hated em

  he paced back into the living room
looked at his watch wondered where vie
was and finally strode into her room look-
ing for a clew he found more than that
he found the great big gold-and-blue striped
box under the end of the bed-the box
bearing the name of mme selma with a
flourish

  there was an appearance of newness
about that box that was disturbing he
drew it forth untied its ribbons and lifted
its lid with a shaking hand he scooped
up the beplumed contents and held them
off at arms length never had he seen any-
thing so artistic but he was not thinking
of the hats beauty from the gorgeous
thing in his hand to the market bag on the
kitchen table his glances traveled like the
hand of an assassin small wonder that the
good housewife was able to provide only
soup meat and carrots for the stomach when
she invested in such a disastrous thing for
the head and his bank balance down to
three figures

  oliver came to a brutal decision he
put the millinery confection back in its bed
of tissue paper replaced the gold lid tied
the lavender ribbons in a hard knot let
himself out the back way boarded a street
car and reached the shop of mme selma
without incident

  the madame had gone to the matinee
but a large-eyed flapper in french heels
greeted him with a smile  can i do any-
thing for you she asked engagingly

   you can replied steele firmly  i
wish to return this hat

  the flappers expression changed she
opened the box and pulled forth the velvet
creation shook it violently turned it over
glanced inside and then rested a puzzled
stare on oliver

    i dont recognize it she said tighten-
ing her thin brows  but it must be ours
as it bears our label looks like a velvet
form we had in stock but the madame must
have trimmed it while your wife waited i
wasnt here myself

  oliver was wondering how much his wife


argosy-allstory weekly

had been trimmed while she waited but put
the question in different words the girl
consulted the books but could find no rec-
ord  evidently mme selma was in a
hurry but i should value the hat in the
neighborhood of one hundred dollars

   oliver hastened to the door for air mum-
 bling something about mrs steele being
 in later to adjust the matter

   meanwhile vie had been having a per-
 fectly lovely time at mrs jellicos-had
 some tea and heard all the details of the
 disappearance of the silverware while mrs
 jellico -who resembled a ripe fig was at the
 beach she brought the rotund little wo-
 man back to the apartment to show off her
 own handiwork and to the horror of both
 the big gold-and-blue box was gone

    another robbery 

   a frantic search of the premises by vie
 while mrs jellico who had just gone
 through a similar experience stood tapping
 the floor with her foot she knew precise-
 ly what to do when mrs steele would ask
 her advice this vie did finally

    call the police of course said mrs
 jellico  but it isnt likely to do any good
 they never get anything back once its
 taken

   the station was appealed to nevertheless
 and responded promptly by sending two de-
 tectives who examined window sills door
 jambs looked suspiciously at mrs jellico
 because she happened to be a figure in two
 cases of thievery in one day and finally be-
 gan to ask questions first they demanded
 a minute description of the missing article
 and vie gave it to them as only she was able
 to do they they came to the valuation

   vie put the value up as one generally
 does when one loses anything and expects
 some one else to pay for it  at least a
 hundred perhaps a hundred and twenty-five
 dollars she replied exchanging a look with
 mrs jellico who puckered her lips in elo-
 quent comprehension

   in such subtleties women stand together
 instinctively

   the detectives said they would concen-
 trate on the case and left the premises but
 once outside they agreed that any woman
 who could afford to spend a hundred bucks
 for a hat could afford to have it stolen

 when oliver got back from the milliners
 he was a little fearful of what he had done
 he let himself into the apartment without
 much ostentation it was a desperate risk
 to seize a bull by the horns and try to
 escape injury and that is precisely what he
 felt he had done it remained to be seen
 whether he could finish the operation tri-
 umphantly or be rolled in the dust of defeat
 and humiliation

    vie on her part trembled too when she
 heard the footfall of her liege lord to buy
 a new hat was cause enough for a domestic
 difference of opinion but to lose it immedi-
 ately thereafter precipitated a situation that
 must be handled with the greatest care

   but oliver gave her no opportunity to
 open the subject  well my dear he be-
 gan peremptorily  what was the general
 idea in purchasing a hat fit for a millionaire
 when i am without an income

   vie had risen to greet him now she sat
 down again abruptly he knew

     i was so sore at sight of it that i car-
 ried it back to mme selmas without delay
 you can go down to-morrow and get your
 money back

   he was secretly amazed at his own force-
 fulness

   mrs steele was on her feet  you-you
 -took the hat back then it wasnt stolen
 at all

   stolen whatever are you talking
 about

   she fanned herself a moment while strug-
 gling to adjust herself to this latest develop-
 ment then she told him of the detectives
 and the cause of their visit but he was not
 concerned with the supposed theft

    what mental aberration inspired you to
 invest a hundred dollars in a hat in our pres-
 ent circumstances he demanded with some
 heat  at a time when wte are living on one
 vegetable-

    a hundred interrupted vie  why
 i paid only fifteen dollars for it you sim-
 pleton those were mv own plumes

  what

    sure douglas sent them to me from
 california hes on an ostrich farm now
 i was keeping them for a surprise you
 made a fine mess of things by your hasti-
 ness we must rush right down to mme
with a wink



 selmas before she closes shes liable to
 sell the hat-

     we interjected ollie eager to be out
 of the problem  theres no use our both
 going you go and get the hat back and
  blame it all on me vie i wont mind
 with her lips losing some of their curves
 mrs steele again boarded the street car
 at the foot of the street and went back to
 the milliners as fast as she could and
 there she received the worst shock of the
 day the beautifully trimmed hat had been
 sold by the flapper fifteen minutes after
 mr steele had returned it

   mme selma had also returned from the
 matinee she listened to vies explanation
 in amazement but she coldly refused to
 divulge the name of the purchaser why
 should she jeopardize her business cer-
 tainly she was not responsible for the mis-
 takes of others she was willing to adjust
 the matter in the only way it couid be ad-
 justed she would rafund the price vie had
 paid plus a fair valuation for the plumes
 the total sum would amount to fifty dollars
 she figured and vie had to be satisfied with
 that

   on the homeward journey she grew mad-
 der with every turn of the street car wheel
 all the joy had gone out of life with that
 hat on her head she could have sailed into
 the wellington reception hall holding her
 nose high but in her last years turban
 she would feel a frump

   she found oliver with an apron tied
 across his chest seated in her best living
 room chair he was peeling the carrots

    i could scream was her opening
 speech  to think that you should do such
 a thing and after me going to all that
 trouble on your account too

    on my account dear

     on your account yes i wanted to im-
 press the wellingtons were going there
 for dinner

    we are he was astonished  then
 why am i peeling these carrots

    how do i know she snapped
  probably because you always do the
 wrong thing carrots arent peeled-theyre
 scraped

     oh well was the only safe thing he
 could think to reply then after a pro-

 longed lull in the conversation he ventured

 did you adjust matters

  she sniffed disparagingly  i adjusted
matters yes i got fifty dollars but id
rather have the hat

  she burst into tears

  oliver sat up suddenly  you got fifty
dollars he related wonderingly  why
that means that those feathers were worth
about seventeen and a half dollars each
doesnt it

   they were worth more than that but
thats all i could get

   say  he exclaimed excitedly  that
gives me a great idea vie if ostrich
plumes bring that much why wouldnt it be
a good scheme to get an interest in an os-
trich farm

   an ostrich farm she stared at him
 why thats what douglas wrote me
about he sent the plumes on as samples
and said if he had five thousand dollars he
could turn over a good proposition in cali-
fornia

   for heavens sake my dear why didnt
you tell me

   where could we get five thousand dol-
lars she demanded shortly

   i could raise it quickly enough for the
right proposition by george i believe this
ostrich farm is the ticket ill get welling-
ton interested he goes in for such things
why sweetheart perhaps my blundering
may prove fortunate for us after all if
he will back me well go out and join doug-
las on the first train so put on your old
bonnet and lets get started

  the wellington motor called and con-
veyed them to the wellington mansion-
one of those houses that glowed one sus-
pected that samuel wellington must own a
lot of electric light stock a maid opened
the door and admitted them to the reception
hall-then disappeared it was all very
elegant

  both the host and hostess came forward
to greet them mrs wellington was one of
those large women who wished to reduce
but couldnt find the time or the necessary
amount of inclination her husband whom
she called sam was much smaller and bald-
headed

  vie was swept upstairs by the hostess


argosy-allstory weekly

who seemed very anxious to show her some-
thing of extraordinary interest to the femi-
nine heart the promoter led oliver to the
dining room and mixed a cocktail just as
he liked it and as he was positive every one
else must like it

   as oliver had not eaten anything since
his meager breakfast of the singular egg the
stimulant got to him rather swiftly and he
had a vague impression that he was talking
with unusual volubility

   the promoter listened listening to
great ideas and squashing them was his mis-
sion in life when the ambitious applicant
for his favor ran out of wind samuel wel-
lington generally opened up with his pet
phrase  youre wrong and ill tell you
why he got it ready now when he im-
agined that the young man before him
was reaching the end of his argument in
favor of ostriches and ostrich plumes as a
paying proposition

   mr wellington put down his cocktail
glass slowly he looked sympathetically
at oliver  youre wrong and ill show
you why young man ollie receded a
pace samuel continued  ostrich plumes
are not as valuable as they once were they
can be bought to-day for a song why
only this afternoon my wife bought a hat
trimmed with two fine feathers-

    you say your wife bought a hat
oliver couldnt keep the exclamation in

   yes-a hat trimmed with ostrich
plumes eighteen inches long looks like a
million dollars but she paid only twenty
for it so you see that smashes your propo-
sition to smithereens

    it does indeed murmured oliver with
 misgivings that is if it happened to be
 the same hat that he had taken back but
 it couldnt be at that price the flapper
 had distinctly told him it was worth a hun-
 dred at least and yet the circumstances
 fitted so perfectly into his experiences and
 those of his wife that the conviction was
 overwhelming

   the ladies entered the dining room
there was a queer expression on vies face
as though she had bitten into a green per-
simmon and was trying to make light of it
she looked cautiously at oliver and he fan-
cied he read aright the message in her eyes

   as mrs wellington had occasion to speak
 to the housekeeper before sitting down and
 as her husband wished to bring forth a bot-
 tle of wine from the bin to which he alone
 had a key the guests were left alone for a
 moment

    mrs wellington bought a hat whis-
 pered oliver

    i saw it vie whispered in return
  its the same

    but she paid only twenty dollars-

    fiddlesticks thats what she told her
 husband she put up a round hundred
 ollie looked helplessly at vie the diplo-
 matic fib of mrs wellington had proved
 the monkey wrench in the machinery of the
 ostrich proposition but what was to be
 done certainly the hostess could not be
 exposed and yet if her unfortunate mis-
 representation were permitted to stand it
 meant finis to steeles opportunity

   the dinner wras rather one-sided that
 is the enthusiasm or the sparkle or the
 verve supposed to attend such an affair
 seemed to spring from the conversation of
 the host and hostess rather than from the
 party as a whole the guests appeared to be
 absent-minded and listless although they
 nodded their heads and smiled and uttered
 monosyllables when they thought such ver-
 bal bursts opportune

  and finally the time of night arrived
when vie  guessed  they must be going
the customary pressure to remain was ap-
plied but not too emphatically and when it
was quite evident that mr and mrs steele
were sincere in their desire to be off mrs
wellington sent for the car

   sam and i will ride home with you
said the hostess without consulting her hus-
band who was quitfe ready to call it an
evening and she again swept vie upstairs
to don their hats when they came down
oliver saw that mrs wellington wore the
ostrich-plumed headpiece and he groaned
inwardly having long since given up hope
that he could ever convince the promoter
of the value of ostrich feathers and still keep
secret the wifes deception

  they reached the steele apartment and
were bidding each other good night for the
tenth time when two men stepped out from
the shadows of trees and approached rap-
with a wink



 idly as they came under the glare of an
 electric light vie recognized them

   the detectives  she exclaimed

   just a moment please said the taller
of the two revealing his badge

   whats the idea demanded welling-
ton sharply

   we want an explanation returned the
plainclothes man  this lady mrs steele
called us in to-day to report the loss of a
hat-

   it doesnt matter interrupted vie
 ive adjusted the matter satisfactorily

   oh you have this rather sarcasti-
cally  well if you will tell us how we
will be able to make out our reports accord-
ingly you claimed the hat was stolen
you gave us a minute description of it
and now unless my eyes are no good the
lady in the car has the stolen hat on her
head

   what

  mrs wellington all but burst with as-
tonished indignation the explosion left
her too breathless to continue immediately
but her husband had his wind removing
his cigar he exclaimed  where do you
get that stuff whats the matter with
you fellows anyway

   nothing the matter with us answered
the detective shortly  but theres some-
thing the matter with this neighborhood
two thefts on this same street have been
reported to-day mrs jellico claimed she
lost her silverware but it has since been
learned that her husband took it out to be
replated then a hat was taken from mrs
steeles apartment so we decided to hang
around now the hat shows up on some one
who is talking quite sociably with the one
who claims she lost it-

   it was a mistake struck in vie  my
hat wasnt stolen at all i just thought it
was she tried to use her best smile but
it wasnt very effective so far as the law was
concerned

   wasnt stolen eh repeated the detec-
tive suspiciously  well then in that case
suppose you go in and bring it out just to
clear up something thats in my mind

  vie gulped she wondered why some one
did not come to her aid  i cant bring
it out she floundered

 why not

 be-because it was returned to the shop

where i had purchased it

oh is that so and what shop was
that if you dont mind

 mme selmas said vie in a weak

voice

the detective turned and fastened his
eyes on mrs wellington  where did you
buy that hat madam

 i bought it at mme selmas and id
like to know whose business it is but my
own 

 what did you pay for it pursued the
officer of the law

 thats none of your-

 tut tut interrupted mr wellington
 theres no need getting bitter over this
little misunderstanding my wife paid
twenty dollars for the hat theres no
secret about it

like a flash the detective turned on
vie

 isnt this the same hat you said was
stolen answer me the penalty for giv-
ing false information to an officer is a severe

one

 yes it looks very much like the same
hat she was forced to admit  but of

course-

 and you said the hat you lost was
worth a hundred perhaps a hundred and

twenty-five dollars did you or did you not
give a false valuation madam

 dont you answer him exclaimed mrs
wellington  if he persists in asking fool-
ish questions he can do so through my law-
yer

 i dont think you have any right to
brow-beat ray wife said oliver hotly

 im not brow-beating anybody re-
turned the detective  im only trying to
get the dope straight for my report but if
that woman sitting in the car says she paid
only twenty dollars for that hat-

samuel screamed mrs wellington
 will you sit there and listen to this com-
mon policeman without a uniform to his
back insult me if there was an officer
around id have him arrested drive us
home james and if this smart aleck wants
any more information let him go and consult
with our lawyers

  there was only one stairway leading to
the roof i found with satisfaction and it
was narrow-an excellent place for defense
the roof was broad and flat flanked at the
ends by two towers which rose considerably
above it

  it was a frightened little group who
gathered about me-the queen and her son
two of the kings councilors and perhaps
half a dozen young girls whom i took to
be the queens attendants others came up
each moment

  i sat the queen down on a little white
stone bench in the center of the garden
and bowed before her respectfully then
i smiled upon them all i think they were
reassured and trusted me and i found my
commands were obeyed without question

 the queen was a woman of perhaps
thirty-five-tall and slender with black
hair and eyes she was dressed in a single
garment of heavy white silk a dress that
fell ungathered at the waist from above her
breast under the arms to her ankles it
was i judged her sleeping robe her hair
hung in two long braids over her shoulders
her feet were incased in sandals

  she was unquestionably a beautiful
woman i remember my vague surprise
as i saw her with her son by her side and
her long sleek wings unmutilated and then
i saw that her wings were fastened together
in two places by little metal chains she
then like other married women was not
permitted to fly although the beauty of her
wings was unspoiled

  i sent two of the old men to stand by
the head of the stairs miela had given me
her knife and i handed it now to one of
thefti trying to make him understand that
he was to bar the passage of any one who
should not be allowed up he shuddered
hut he took the knife and stood where i
indicated

  the crowd in the garden below had seen
us on the roof now and the tumult of
shouts was doubled i went to the parapet
and looked over

  the garden was full of a struggling con-
fused mass of people those nearest the
castle were mostly peons i noticed men
and a few women armed with various im-
plements of agriculture and any sort of

rude weapon they could obtain they were
standing about in little groups or rushing
excitedly to and fro in aimless uncommand-
ed activity

  many of them held stones in their hands
which occasionally they cast at the building
it was one of those mobs that gather ready
for trouble is swayed in almost any di-
rection by any chance leadership and most
frequently accomplishes nothing

  i felt a sudden sense of relief the gar-
den was rapidly filling up with men and
women of the more intelligent classes who
mingled with the others learned what had
occurred-for i did not doubt but that the
knowledge of the kings death had spread
about-and then stood waiting to see what
would happen

  the air was full of excited girls flying
over the castle a few alighted for a mo-
ment on the roof but i did not fear them
where was baar i could not hope to dis-
tinguish him among the crowd but still i
saw no sign of his leadership had he seen
the failure of his plan and fearing the re-
sults of his regicide fled the vicinity i
hoped so fervently

  as i showed myself at the parapet a great
shout arose some of the men-i knew at
once it was those who had heard i possessed
the light-ray-scattered in terror at my ap-
pearance i determined then if no issue
were raised that would demand my using
this supposed weapon i could continue to
command the situation

  i stood there a moment looking down
at the edge of the crowd i saw a few
figures whom i took to be members of the
citys police they were standing idle tak-
ing no part in what was going on there
seemed nothing i could do until miela re-
turned if only i could speak to the
crowd i wondered if i dared descend
among them and disperse the mob of peons
i went to the head of the stairway three
or four of the kings councilors were stand-
ing there

  there was no one on the stairs evident-
ly every one living in the castle was now
on its roof-some thirty of them altogether
the crowd outside quite evidently had no
present intention of entering the building
the mob of peons baar had gathered were
the fire people



greatly in the minority now and i felt that
matters were steadily improving i won-
dered where miela was and then while i
was standing there i saw her coming up the
stairs a man following close behind her

  i think i have never been so glad to see
any one as i was to see her at this mo-
ment her face was grave her demeanor
calm as before

   he is here she said as she came to
the head of the stairs this is fuero
alan leader of the men of science who have
the ray

  as he came out onto the roof i saw
this man wras easily the most dominant per-
sonality i had so far encountered on mer-
cury he was tall for his race although
several inches shorter than i a man of sixty
perhaps with iron-gray hair falling long
about his ears

  he wore sandals and a pair of the usual
knee-length wide-cut trousers but what
distinguished him in his dress was a broad
panel of heavy silk hanging from neck to
knee both in back and front with an open-
ing at the top through which his head was
thrust this silken panel was some eighteen
inches wide light gray in color and richly
embroidered in gold in various designs it
hung free except for a slight fastening at
the waist line beneath it the mans naked
torso-and his bare arms-showed power-
fully muscled

  his face was smooth shaven with strong
regular features i noticed too there was
a slight cleft in his square chin his fore-
head was high his blue eyes kindly yet
with a searching piercing quality about
them

  it was not so much the mans general
appearance as his bearing that made me
realize he was a forceful character there
was about him unmistakable poise i knew
at once he felt his power his authority
that he would use it wisely i could not
doubt

  he stood regarding me gravely-an ap-
praising regard under which i felt myself
flushing a little miela spoke to him swift-
ly and he inclined his head to me by way
of introduction his glance meanwhile taking
in the scene on the roof

  with miela as interpreter we held a hur-

ried conversation i learned then that
fuero and his associates had many years
before organized a society for the develop-
ment of the light-ray in its various forms
they had soon realized in their experiments
its diabolical powrer of destruction and had
taken oath then that they would not use
it or allow it to be used except under the
most critical circumstances of the nations
welfare

  realizing too the power it gave them as
individuals they had sworn to remain men
of science only taking no part in public
affairs remaining rigidly aloof from all na-
tional affairs most of their work con-
cerned the development of the light-ray for
industrial purposes in these forms it de-
veloped heat but had very little power of
projection

  all this miela told me in a few brief
sentences

   how did tao get the ray i de-
manded

   some members of the society proved
false she answered  when tao was ban-
ished to the twilight country they desert-
ed their brothers and joined him there
were others with him of scientific mind
and these soon learned how to make it
too

  fuero was still regarding me appraisingly
i felt suddenly very young very inadequate
as i stood there facing him but i met his
gaze squarely and all at once he smiled

   he says  let us speak to the people 
said miela

  we went to the parapet only a few
moments had elapsed since i had stood
there before the situation below was un-
changed except that the crowd had grown
denser

  a sudden hush fell as they saw us
fuero turned to me and spoke quietly
his eyes seemed searching out my thoughts

   he asks you my husband if you will
take oath before your god to do what is
right for our people he wishes to trust
you now in this crisis for there is no one
else and he believes in you

   i will miela i said solemnly  be-
fore god i swear it

  the man gazed steadily into my eyes an-
other instant then abruptly he thrust a


argosy-allstory weekly

small metal cylinder into my hand i thrilled
as my fingers closed around it he seemed
to hesitate then he turned and slowly cross-
ing the rooftop looking neither to right nor
left he descended the stairs out of our
sight

  he had done what he thought was best
and having done it had withdrawn imme-
diately from further participation in the
affair

  it may have been the absence of his dom-
inant personality or the grasp of my hand
about this little metal cylinder but now i
felt a renewed sense of responsibility and
with it a feeling of power that swept aside
all doubts and all fears now i could com-
mand could guide and control the destiny
of this nation and could thank god save
my own world

   miela i said  tell the queen her son
shall be king i am about to proclaim him
king before the people and i as regent will
rule tell her that and bring him here now
to me

  the queen made no answer save a slight
inclination of her head but i saw that
she had recovered composure she pushed
her son gently away from her and i strode
forward to meet him

   tell him miela he is a man now and
must have no fear for he is the greatest man
in all this land

  i patted his shoulder as he stood beside
me and he looked up into my face and
smiled bravely

  the top of the parapet was flat and
broad i raised the little boy up and stood
him upon it instantly another tumult of
shouts arose

  i looked down and saw the figure of
fuero as he stalked unheeding across the
garden the people respectfully opening up
a path before his advance

  approval and derision seemed mingled in
the crics that greeted the appearance of the
little prince

   quiet them if you can miela i said
 speak to them

  i steadied the boy with my hand and
he stood there unafraid a sturdy manly
little figure

  miela raised her voice and began speak-
ing the shouts partially ceased then sud-

denly a stone struck the parapet almost in

front of us

  a sudden rage possessed me i fumbled
at the cylinder i held it was very much
like a little hand flashlight and seemed to
have a knob at my thumb miela stopped
speaking and turned to me

   there-press that alan careful
aim it there see over there against
those palms

  i held the thing up and pointed it to-
ward the huge royal palms aiming at their
graceful fronds high over the heads of the
people my hand pressed the knob the
little cylinder seemed to thrill in my grasp
a tiny beam of light shot out-quite plainly
visible-a green shading into red it
struck the palm branches and silently yet
rapidly as though they were under some
giant blow-torch they shriveled crackled
and burst into flame

  mielas fingers bit into my arm

   enough alan stop

  my thumb yielded to the upward pres-
sure of the tiny knob against it and ab-
ruptly the light vanished a narrow swath
had been cut through the palms-a furrow
of death plowed by the pressure of my
thumb against a bit of metal

  the crowd had frozen into the immobil-
ity of terror now as the dreaded ray van-
ished as suddenly as it had sprung forth
they turned with cries of fright to escape
no one had been hurt i shuddered as i
realized now that many girls had been in
the air and through no thought or skill of
mine had they escaped

   speak to them man miela cried
 there must be no panic here must they
stay and listen to what you have to say
speak to them stop them now

  i handed her the cylinder lest the dia-
bolical thing spit forth again its fire from
my unskillful fingers and leaped to the
top of the parapet

  stop i shouted at the top of my
voice  stop-all of you at once

  i waved my arms violently i knew my
words meant nothing but my voice carried
far the excitement continued but a
few stopped and stared at me then others
and gradually there was less confusion
miela turned and shouted something to
the fire people



the girls on the rooftop instantly they
spread their wings and flew down circling
close over the heads of the people

   wait alan a moment now and there
will be quiet the girls are telling them
not to fear hut to wait and listen to what
you have to say

  miela stood now upon the parapet top
with the little prince between us she had
concealed the tiny metal cylinder in her
belt her open palms were flung out before
her and her wings spread and flapping
slowly raised her on tiptoe every line
of her graceful body was tense her attitude
bespoke power dominance authority and
then she began to talk in a voice vibrant
with emotion once she laid her hand
lightly upon the curly head of the little
boy and a tremulous uncertain cheer an-
swered her from below

   i have told them of the kings death
alan she said a moment later  and that
here is their little king standing before
them and now of you-what shall i
say

   tell them that until the king is older
i-the man from earth-shall rule them
as regent tell them if they obey me all
will be well for i shall rule them wisely

   i stood while miela translated this amid
dead silence from the crowd as she fin-
ished i raised myself to full height and
stared down at them threateningly

    but if there is trouble-if any one de-
fies my authority-then miela tell them
i shall use the light-ray for i shall brook
no interference

   the silence from below- continued

  i spread my hands out before me and
smiled

    but there will be no trouble i am with
the light country heart and soul its in-
terests are my interests for i have married
one of its women and now i too am one of
its people

   tao shall be overthrown-tell them
that miela the twilight people never
again shall threaten our cities if more
land is wanted by our people of the light
country tell them they shall have it all
the land they desire shall be theirs for
vhen tao is vanquished i shall build great
cars such as he is building and all who wish

may go to my earth peacefully and we will
make them welcome as i have been made
welcome here

  a cheer arose as miela translated this
and now for the first time i heard no cries
of dissent

   say to them again i shall rule them
wisely say i shall look to them-all of
them rich and poor alike-for help in what
we have to do all must help me for i
am only one and i need them all when
this work we have to do is over when our
nation is freed forever from this menace
from across the sea tell them that then i
will give my every thought to the details of
their welfare all that they wish-if it lays
in my power-shall be done

   a girl alighted for an instant on the para-
pet near me another darted downward in
her flight evidently to avoid the disrespect
of passing directly in front of me the
thought flashed through my mind that i
might mention the virgins and promise them
reversal of the law they so abhorred but i
felt it would be impolitic to raise that ques-
tion at such a time as this

   tell them now to leave the grounds
quietly i concluded  when i wish them
again they will be sent for all that i do
will be known through public proclama-
tion

  i lifted the little prince in my arms and
then with the cheers of the people ringing
in my ears jumped backward with him to
the roof below

  thus by swift moving circumstances
which could not have been foreseen was i
made ruler of the light country the
crowd dispersed quietly we sent the queen
and her waiting maids back to her apart-
ments the aged councilors to theirs and
soon miela and i were alone in one of the
castle rooms

  now that the nervous excitement under
which i had been laboring was over i felt
utterly exhausted i dropped wearily into
a seat and miela sat on the floor at my
feet with her arms on my knees

  i stroked her glossy black hair idly

   im tired girl im all in arent
you

  we had not slept since the afternoon be-
fore and so much had happened since


argosy-allstory weekly

  suddenly i remembered lua

   miela-your mother we must find
her i started to my feet then sat down
again

  there was no use of my rushing away on
some aimless search over a city like this

   wthere is the head of the citys police
miela

   i have sent for him he should be
here now to see you

   i must have him search the city lua
must be found the castle guards-we
must appoint others miela i must have
a council too-not doddering old men but
others that we shall select who collects
the taxes where is the money wtio
handles it

  the questions piled upon me faster than
i could voice them and all the while my
tired brain and weary aching body called
only for rest-for sleep

  i thought of mercer and anina they
should be back by now

   we must send home and have them
told we are here miela and that slave
woman of baars-she will be there too
she must be sent here to us also

  we had decided to live in the castle

   wtaen mercer and anina return we
must arrange to go to the water city the
disturbance there must be quelled all the
cities must be told of our actions here i
must visit them all miela

  my voice seemed trailing off as though
i were talking to myself a thousand prob-
lems rushed in confusion through my mind
i felt i was talking almost incoherently a
knock on the door of our room brought
me to myself

  a young girl stood respectfully on the
threshold miela listened to what she had
to say questioned her swiftly and then
turned to me her face had gone suddenly
white

   the girls have returned from over the
sea alan this is one of them but anina
and our friend ollie have stayed there

   stayed there i cried  why

   they set free taos men as we planned
they were on their way back when the
earth-man suddenly bid anina return
something was wrong he said this girl
does not understand what but they went

back and anina and ollie they left there
standing on the shore together we are to
go over to the same place to-night if we
can and get them that is all the girl

knows

  the girl withdrew after a moment

  mercer and anina left in the twilight
country miela and i stared at each other
blankly

chapter xx

in the twilight country

mercer sat on the rear end of the
platform and waved good-by vigor-
ously as he was carried swiftly up
and out over the water under him was
a pile of blankets and a coat and beside
him a box of baked dough like bread-
the food he was to turn over to taos emis-
saries when he set them free

  anina flew at his side at intervals smil-
ing up at him reassuringly before him on
the platform his captives huddled al-
though all of them were trussed up secure-
ly he menacingly kept his little wooden
revolver pointed at them from the level of
his knee

  he chuckled as he thought of the fight at
the bayou everything was working out
all right it was surprising what one could
do with his physical strength here on mer-
cury

  the girls had carried the platform up
some five hundred feet above the sea mer-
cer turned and looked back the shore
had already dropped almost to the rim of
the close-encircling horizon he leaned
over toward anina resting one hand on the
bamboo handle she was holding  how
long will it take us to get tfiere anina

  he knew the girl would understand his
words but he did not realize she had little
basis for comparing time in his language

   long time she answered smiling
 but we go quickly now

  he sat back again and waited it seemed
like hours-it was hours probably three or
four-and still they swept onward straight
as an arrow

  after another interminable interval anina
raised one hand and pointed ahead
the fire people



   twilight country-there she said

  mercer saw coming up over the horizon
the dim outlines of a rocky land sparsely
covered with trees it spread out rapidly
before him as he watched fascinated it
seemed a desolate land a line of low bar-
ren hills off to one side and a forest of
stunted naked-looking trees in front the
platform swept on over the shore line a
rocky beach on which the calm sea rolled
up in tiny white lines of breakers then
in a great curve the girls circled to one
side

   where are we going mercer asked

   a trail-near us somewhere a trail
to the lone city there we land

  mercer saw the trail in a moment it
came out of the woods and struck the shore
by a little bight where boats could land
the girls swooped downward and in a mo-
ment more the platform was lying motion-
less on the beach

  mercer looked around it was light
enough to see objects in the immediate
foreground-a gray twilight the forest
came almost to the waters edge he saw
now the trees might have been firs but
with small twisted trunks few branches
except near the top and very few leaves
they seemed somehow very naked and
starved-indeed it surprised him that they
could grow at all in such a rocky waste
the end of the trail was close before him
it appeared merely an opening in the trees
with the fallen logs and underbrush cleared
away

  the girls were obviously cold standing
idle now after their long flight mercer lost
no time in preparing for the return journey
he tumbled his captives unceremoniously
off the platform and set the box of food and
blankets beside them

   whats this anina

  he was holding in his palm a tiny metal
cylinder

   anina took it from him

    for fire see

  she picked up a bit of driftwood and
holding the end of the cylinder against it
pressed a little button a curl of smoke
rose from the wood and in a moment a
wisp of flame

   a light-ray mercer exclaimed

   the ray-but different

  she tossed the blazing bit of wood aside
and held her hand a foot or so in front of
the cylinder

   no danger see she brought her
hand closer  heat here-close-no heat
far away

  mercer understood then that this was not
a light-ray projector but a method of pro-
ducing heat with the property of radiation
but not of projection-a different and harm-
less form of the ray

  he took the little cylinder from the girl
inspected it curiously then laid it on the
blankets

   theyll need it i guess if its any
colder where theyre going

  he set one of the captives free

   anina tell him to sit quiet until weve
gone then he can cut the others loose
he tossed a knife into the box  come on
anina lets get away

  they were about ready to start back
when mercer suddenly decided he was hun-
gry he hopped off the platform  they
dont need all that food

  he gathered some of the little flat cakes
of dough in his hands  want some he
offered them to the girls who smilingly re-
fused

   all right i do im hungry might
as well lake a blanket too its devilish
cold

  he was back on the platform in a mo-
ment sitting down with the blanket about
his knees and munching contentedly at the
bread

   all right anina start her off

  they swung up into the air and began
the return flight

  a few hours more and they would be
back at the great city then the real
work would begin mercer squared his
shoulders unconsciously as he thought of all
there was to do

  but there was no danger to the light
country from tao he thought with satis-
faction at least there would be none
when the other cities were rid of taos men
as the great city was now the men would
find their way back all right-

  at the sudden thought that came to him
mercer dropped his bit of bread and sat up


argosy-allstory weekly

in astonishment tao no longer a menace
he remembered my reasoning in the boat
coining down the bayou of course tao
would have no reason to attack the light
country by force of arms until he was sure
his propaganda among the people had
failed

  my argument was sound enough but the
utter stupidity of what we had done now
dawned on mercer with overwhelming
force tao would await the results of his
emissaries work of course and here we
had gone and sent them straight back to
their leader to report their efforts a fail-
ure if anything were needed to precipi-
tate an invasion from tao this very thing
mercer had just finished doing was it he
cursed himself and me fervently as he
thought what fools we had been

  then it occurred to him perhaps it was
not too late to repair the damage not
more than half an hour had passed since
he had set the men free on the shore of
the twilight country he must go back
at once under no circumstances must they
be allowed to reach tao and tell him what
had occurred

  anina was flying near mercer as before
he leaned over the edge of the platform
to talk with her but the wind of their for-
ward flight and the noise of the girls wings
made conversation difficult

   anina come up here with me sit
here i want to talk to you its impor-
tant they dont need you flying now
obediently the girl sat where he indi-
cated close beside him and then as he
was about to begin telling her what was in
his mind mercer suddenly remembered that
they were still heading toward the light
country every moment getting farther
away from taos men whose homeward
journey he must head off some way

   we must go back anina-back where
we came from-at once tell them-nowl
then ill tell you why

  the girls eyes widened but she did as
he directed and the platform making a
broad sweeping turn headed back toward
the twilight country shore

   anina how far is it to taos city from
where we landed

   the lone city a day going fast

   but they wont go fast will they

some of them are pretty badly hurt

   two days for them the girl agreed

  mercer then told her what an error we
had made she listened quietly but he
knew she understood not only his words
but the whole situation as he viewed it
then

   most bad she said solemnly when he
paused

   thats what i want to tell you its
bad he declared  weve got to head
them off some way stop them somehow
i dont see how were going to capture
them again-ten of them against me but
weve got to do something

  then he asked her about the lay of the
country between the shore of the sea and
the lone city

  aninas english wras put to severe test by
her explanation but she knew far many
more words than she had ever used and
now with the interest of what she had to
say she lost much of the diffidence which
before had restrained her

  she told him that the trail led back
through the forest for some distance and
then ran parallel with a swift flowing river
this river she explained emptied into the
narrow sea a few miles below the end of
the trail it was the direct water route to
the lone city

  the trail striking the river bank fol-
lowed it up into a mountainous country-
a metallic waste where few trees grew
there was a place still farther up in a
very wild broken country where the river
ran through a deep narrow gorge and the
trail followed a narrow ledge part way up
one of its precipitous sides

  aninas eyes sparkled with eagerness as
she told of it

   there my friend ollie we stop them
many loose stones there are and the path
is very narrow

  mercer saw her plan at once they could
bar the mens passage somewhere along this
rocky trail and with stones drive them
back he realized with satisfaction that
he could throw a stone fully twice as large
and twice as far as any of the men and
thus out of range bombard them until
they would be glad enough to turn back
the fire people



  his plan then was to land and with
anina follow the men the rest of the
girls he would send back to me with the
platform to tell miela and me to come
over the next evening to the end of the
trail

  he and anina meanwhile would keep
close behind the men and then when the
canon was neared get around in front of
them and bar their farther advance this
would be easy since he could walk and run
much faster than they and anina could fly
he would drive them back out of the gorge
send anina to keep the appointment with
me and bring me up to him with the girls
and the platform

  they reached the shore and landed with-
in a few feet of where they had been an
hour before the men were not in sight
nothing remained to show they had been
there save pieces of cut cord lying about

  anina now instructed the girls what to
tell me and in a moment more with the
blanket and a few pieces of bread she and
mercer were left standing alone on the
rocky beach anina was cold he took
off his fur jacket and wrapped it about her
shoulders

  she made a quaint little picture standing
there with her two long braids of golden
hair and her blue-feathered wings which
the jacket only partly covered they
started up the trail together it was al-
most dark in the woods but soon their eyes
grew accustomed to the dim light and they
could see a little better they walked as
rapidly as anina was able for the men had
nearly an hours start and mercer con-
cluded they would be far ahead

  they had gone perhaps a mile climbing
along over fallen logs walking sometimes
on the larger tree trunks lying prone-rude
bridges by which the trail crossed some
ravine-when anina said

   i fly now you wait here ollie and i
find where they are

  she handed him the coat and flew up
over the treetops disappearing almost im-
mediately in the darkness mercer slung
the coat around him and sat down to wait
he sat there perhaps fifteen or twenty min-
utes staring up at the silent motionless
treetops and thinking all sorts of vague

impossible dangers impending then he
heard her wings flapping and saw her flit-
ting down through the trees

   very near they are she said as soon
as she reached the ground  a fire-
they have-and they are ready now to
sleep

  they went on slowly along the trail and
soon saw the glimmer of a fire ahead  a
camp for the night whispered mercer
 it must be nearly morning now

  he looked about him and smiled as he
realized that no light would come with the
morning always this same dim twilight
here-and eternal darkness on ahead
good lord what a place to live he
muttered

  they crept on cautiously until they were
within sight of the camp a large fire was
burning briskly most of the men were
wrapped in their blankets apparently
asleep three were sitting upright on guard
mercer and anina crept away

   wed better camp too mercer said
when they were well out of hearing  they
will probably stay there four or five hours
anyway lord im tired he laid his
hand on her shoulder gently almost timidly
 arent you tired too little girl

   yes she answered simply and met
his eyes with her gentle little smile  oh
yes-i tired very much

  they did not dare light a fire nor had
they any means of doing so they went
back from the trail a short distance find-
ing a little recess between two fallen logs
where the ground was soft with a heavy
moss here they decided to sleep for a
few hours

  a small pool of water had collected on a
barren surface of rock near by and from
this they drank then they sat down to-
gether and ate about half the few remain-
ing pieces of bread which mercer was car-
rying in the pockets of his jacket they
were both tired out anina particularly
was very sleepy

  when they had finished eating anina lay
down and mercer covered her with the
blanket she smiled up at him

   good night anina

   good night my friend ollie

  she closed her eyes snuggling closer un-


argosy-allstory weekly

der the blanket with a contented little sigh
mercer put on his jacket and sat down be-
side her his chin cupped in his hand it
seemed colder now his trousers were thin
his legs felt numb and stiff from his recent
exertion

  he sat quiet staring at the sleeping girl
she was very beautiful and very sweet
lying there with her golden hair framing
her face her little head pillowed on her
arms a portion of one blue-feathered wing
peeping out from under the blanket all
at once mercer bent over and kissed her
lightly brushing her lips with his as one
kisses a sleeping child

  she stirred then opened her eyes and
smiled up at him again

   you cold ollie she said accusingly
she lifted an edge of the blanket  here
-you sleep too

  he stretched himself beside her and she
flung a comer of the blanket over him and
thus like two children lost in the woods and
huddled together for warmth under a fallen
log they slept

chapter xxi

another light-ray

the news that mercer and anina had
been left in the twilight country
completely dumfounded miela and
me  something was wrong mercer had
said and then they had insisted on stay-
ing there and had sent the girls back to
tell me to come over

  we could make nothing of it nor did
the half hour of argument into which we
immediately plunged further enlighten us
that flaw in our plans which had dawned
on mercer so suddenly and clearly certainly
never occurred to us for all it was seeming-
ly so obvious

  we were interrupted-having reached no
conclusion whatever except that we would
go over that evening as mercer had di-
rected-by the arrival of the police chief
to see me he was a little man curiously
thin and wizened for a mercutian with
wide pantaloons a shirt short jacket and
little triangular cocked hat his face
seemed pointed like a ferret his move-

ments were rapid his roving glance pecu-
liarly alert

  he bowed before me obsequiously he
would obey me to the letter i could see
that at once from his manner though had
i impressed him as being like my prede-
cessor i did not doubt but that he would
do as he pleased upon occasion

  i	toyed with the little light-ray cylinder
in my hand quite casually through the brief
interview and i saw he wras thoroughly
impressed for he seemed unable to take his
eyes from it

   where are your men just now i
asked

  he raised bis hands deprecatingly and
poured out a flood of words to miela when
my question was translated to him

   he himself was sleeping she said to
me when he had paused for breath  his
third watch wtas on patrol about the city
then from the castle came the kings
guards fleeing in haste the of the po-
lice they met they told that evil men were
in the castle with the light-ray and all who
represented the citys authority would be
killed

   that was a lie i interrupted  there
wras no light-ray here then

  miela nodded  it was what baars
men had told them to say  think

   and then what happened to the po-
lice

   then they left their posts about the
city some fled others went back and
reported what they had heard

   and it never occurred to any of them
to come up here and try to stop the dis-
turbance curious policemen these

   it is too deadly-the light-ray said
miela  they were afraid and then the
alarm bell began ringing they sent for
ano here to ask him what they should do
and then you sent for him he has his
men at the police building in waiting and
he comes to you at the risk of his life and
now asks your commands

  thus did my chief of police explain sat-
isfactorily to himself and with great protes-
tations of loyalty to his trust how it came
about that he and his men did nothing while
their king was being murdered and another
put in his place

                          	a
the fire people



  recriminations seemed useless he stood
bowing and scraping before me eager only
to obey my slightest wish

   tell him miela how baars men cap-
tured lua have the city thoroughly
searched-baars house particularly tell
him  killed baars wife have that slave
woman sent home to me

   tell him to capture baar and any of
his known associates if he does have him
report to me at once say to him that i
must have word of lua-or ill have a new
chief of police by to-morrow for the rest
have his men patrol the city as usual

  i spoke as sternly as i could and the
little man received my words with voluble
protestations of extreme activity on his part

  when he had bowed himself out i smiled
at miela hopelessly

   this has got to be a mighty different
government before we can ever hope to
accomplish anything against tao tao
was not worrying me for the moment lua
must be found and i had no idea of rely-
ing entirely upon this little chief of police to
find her and mercer needed me too this
very evening

   i stood up wearily and put my arm
about mielas shoulders her little body
drooped against mine her head resting on
my shoulder there was little about us
then as we stood there dispirited and phys-
ically tired out that would have commend-
ed respect from our subjects

   we must get some sleep miela i said

	things will look very different to us
then

  it must have been mid-afternoon when
we awoke ano was at hand to report that
baar and his men and all the kings guards
must have fled the city of lua he had
so far found no trace baars slave wom-
an was in the castle waiting our com-
mands the girl who had brought us mer-
cers message was also waiting to ask us
when we wanted her and the other girls for
the trip back to the twilight country

   right away i exclaimed  im not
going to take any chances with mercer
well start at once

  the girl flew away to get her friends and
the platform which had been left in the
garden of mielas home i planned to start

    	a

openly from the castle roof there was now
no need of maintaining secrecy

  the disappearance of lua was alarming
equally so was the possible danger into
which mercer might have blundered in
luas case there did not seem much i could
do personally at that moment before
starting i arranged with the aged councilors
to call a meeting the following morning of
all government officials

   could we get fuero to come miela
she shook her head positively  his
oath would forbid it

    well tell the councilors to call also any
of the citys prominent men ive got to
get some good men with me i cant do it
all alone

  miela smiled at me quizzically as i said
this

  you have forgotten our women and
their help my husband

   had in very truth for the moment

   well need them too i said  tell
these girls who carry us to-night to call
all those who went with us to the moun-
tains-a meeting to-morrow at this time-
here on the castle roof

  to the water city we must go miela
said  there taos men are very strong
our girls report and to-day there was a
fight among the people and several were
killed

   but we must go armed miela with
more than one light-ray i shall see this
fuero to-morrow after all hes the key-
note to the whole thing

  we started from the castle roof miela
sitting with me this time on the platform
flying low we passed over the maze of
bayous and in what seemed an incredibly
short time we were out over the sea i
had now no idea what we might be called
upon to do or how long we would be gone
for all my specific plans for the next day
so we started as well prepared as possible

  the precious light-ray cylinder i held in
my hand we had a number of blankets
enough food for us all for two days of care-
ful rationing a knife or two and a heavy
sharp-edged metal implement like an ax

  it seemed hardly more than half an hour
before a great black cloud had spread over
the whole sky and we ran into the worst


argosy-allstory weekly

storm i have ever encountered the wind
came up suddenly and we fought our way
directly into it lightning flashed about us
and then came the rain slanting down in
great sheets

  we were still flying low the mirror
surface of the sea wras now lashed with
waves extraordinarily high whose white
tops blew away in long streaks of scud
the girls fought sturdily against the wind
and rain carrying us steadily up until after
a while i could not see the water below

  we were in the storm perhaps an hour
altogether then we passed up and beyond
it and emerged again into that gray va-
cancy with a waste of storm-lashed water
far beneath us

  the twilight country shore -was still be-
low the horizon and it was a considerable
time before we sighted it miela and i sat
quiet wrapped in a blanket which wet
as it was offered some protection against
the biting wind the girls seemed exhaust-
ed from their long struggle against the
storm and i was glad for them when we
finally landed

  this was the place they said where
mercer and anina had set taos men free
and where the two were standing when the
girls had left with the platform i looked
about and saw on the beach the pieces of
cut cord with which the men had been
bound

  of mercer and anina there was no sign
we waited until well after the time of the
evening meal and still mercer and anina
did not arrive we concluded of course
that they had followed taos men up the
trail for some reason and we expected it
would be anina who would come back to
tell us where mercer was

   let us go up a little distance miela
suggested finally  they cannot tell what
the hour is they may be near here now
coming back

  the girls were rested and warmed now
and we started off again -with the platform
we flewr low over the treetops following the
trail as best we could but in the semi-
darkness we could see very little from
above after a time we gave it up and re-
turned to the shore

 again wre waited now very much

alarmed and then finally we decided to
return to the great city for the night
anina might have missed us some way we
thought and flown directly home she
might be there w-aiting for us when we
arrived if not we would return again with
several hundred girls and with them scour
the country carefully back as near the lone
city as we dared go

  writh our hearts heavy with apprehension
we started back across the channel lua
mercer and anina were separated from us
all had been captured perhaps by our
enemies things were indeed in a very
bad way

  without unusual incident we sighted the
light country shore three girls were
winging their wtay swiftly toward us

   they wish to speak with us alan
said miela  from the great city they
seem to come perhaps it is anina

  our hopes were soon dispelled for
anina was not one of them they were
three of the girls we had directed to patrol
the seacoast

  when they neared us miela flew off the
platform and joined them they circled
about for a time flying close together then
miela left them and returned to me while
they hovered overhead her face was
clouded with anxiety as she alighted be-
side me

   they were near the water city a short
time ago and they say the light-ray is
being used there they saw it flashing
up and dared not go closer

  the light-ray in the water city my
heart sunk with dismay the cylinder 
held in my hand i had thought the only one
in use in all the light country with it
i felt supreme and now they had it also
in the water city

  one of the gicls flung up her hand sud-
denly and called to miela

   see alan-a boat

  i looked down to where miela pointed
the sea was still rough from the storm
but no longer lashed into fury coming
toward us close inshore and from the direc-
tion of the water city i saw a boat speed-
ing along over the spent waves and as
i looked a narrow beam of light green
shading into red shot up from the boat and
the fire people



 hung wavering in the air like a little search-
 light striving to pierce the gray mist of the
 sky

chapter xxii

    the theft of the light-ray

the touch of soft cool hands on his
face brought mercer back to sud-
den consciousness he opened his
eyes anina was sitting beside him regard-
ing him gravely

   wake up my friend ollie time now
 to wake up

   he sat up rubbing his eyes the same
 dim twilight obscured everything around
 for an instant he was confused

    why ive been asleep he got to his
 feet  do you think its been long anina
 maybe the men have started off lets go
 see

   anina had already been to see she had
 awakened some little time before and leav-
 ing mercer asleep had flown up ahead over
 the treetops

   the men were just then breaking camp
 and she had returned to wake up mercer
 they ate their last remaining pieces of
 bread drank from the little pool of water
 and were soon ready to start on after their
 quarry

    how long will it take them to reach
 the gorge anina

   not very long-four times farther
reach lone city

  by which mercer inferred that within
 three or four hours perhaps they would
 be at the place where they hoped to turn
 the men back

   they started off slowly up the trail mer-
 cer carrying the folded blanket and anina
 wearing the fur jacket they soon came
 upon the smoldering fire that marked the
 other partys night encampment the men
 were mercer judged perhaps a mile or so
 ahead of them

     they continued on walking slowly for
  they did not want to overtake the slow-
  traveling men ahead the look of the coun-
  try what they could see of it in the dark-
  ness was unchanged the trail seemed
  lending steadily to the right and after a

time they came to the bank of a river which
the trail followed it was a broad stream
perhaps a quarter of a mile across with a
considerable current sweeping down to the
sea

  they kept to the trail along the river
bank for nearly another hour then anina
abruptly halted pulling mercer partly be-
hind a tree trunk

   another fire she whispered  they
stop again

  they could see the glow of the fire close
by the river bank among the trees very
cautiously they approached and soon made
out the vague outlines of a boat moored
to the bank it seemed similar to the one
in which they had come down the bayous
from the great city only slightly larger

   other men whispered anina  from
lone city

  mercers heart sank a party from the
lone city-more of taos men to join those
he had set free all his fine plans were
swept away the men would all go up to
the lone -city now in the boat of course
there was nothing he could do to stop
them and now tao would learn of the
failure of his plans

  mercers first idea wyas to give up and
return to the shore of the sea but anina
kept on going cautiously forward and he
followed her

   the fire they could see as they got closer
was built a little back from the water with
a slight rise of ground between it and the
boat there were some thirty men gath-
ered around they seemed to be cooking

   you stand here ollie anina whis-
pered  i go hear what they say stand
very quiet and wait i come back

  mercer sat down with his back against a
tree and waited anina disappeared almost
immediately he heard no sound of her
flight but a moment later he thought he
saw her dropping down through the trees
just outside the circle of light from the fire
from where he was sitting he could see
the boat also he thought he made out the
figure of a man sitting in it on guard the
situation as mercer understood it from
what anina told him when she returned
seemed immeasurably worse even than he
had anticipated


argosy-allstory weekly

  tao had been making the water city
the basis of his insidious propaganda
rather than the great city as we had sup-
posed he had been in constant communi-
cation by boat with his men in the water
city and now affairs there were ripe for
more drastic operations

  this boat mercer had come upon was
intended to be taos first armed invasion
of the light country-some twenty of his
most trusted men armed with the light-ray
joining his emissaries in the water city
and with the large following among the
people there which they had already se-
cured they planned to seize the govern-
ment and obtain control of the city then
using it as a base they could spread out
for a conquest of the entire nation mer-
cer listened with whitening face while anina
told him all this as best she could

   but-but why does he want to attack
the light country anina i thought he
wanted to go and conquer our earth
very big task-your earth the girl
answered  light country more easy
many light-rays in the great city those
he needs before he goes to your earth more
simple to get those than make others
mercer understood it then the large
quantity of light-ray ammunition stored in
the great city was what tao was after
this was his way of getting it and once he
had it and control of the light country
besides he would be in a much better posi-
tion to attack the earth

  the idea came to mercer then to steal the
boat and escape with it if he could do
that the enemies would have to return to
the lone city on foot and the threatened
invasion of the light country would thus
be postponed for a time at least mean-
while with the boat he could hasten back
to me with news of the coming invasion

  these thoughts were running through his
head while anina was talking it was a
daring plan but it might be done there
was apparently only one man in the boat
and the slight rise of ground between it
and the fire made him out of sight though
not out of hearing of the others

   can you run the boat anina

  the girl nodded eagerly mercer drew a
long breath

   well take a chance its the only
way theyve got that cursed light-ray
he shivered as he thought of the danger
they were about to invite

  then he explained to anina what they
were to do she listened carefully with the
same expectant eager look on her face he
had seen there so often before

  they left the blanket and fur jacket on
the ground and making a wide detour
around the fire came back to the river
bank several hundred yards above the boat
they stood at the waters edge looking
about them the boat was just around a
slight bend in the stream the glimmer of
the fire showed plainly among the trees
intense quiet prevailed only the murmur
of the water flowing past and occasionally
the raised voice of one of the men about the
fire broke the stillness

  mercer stared searchingly into the girls
eyes as she stood there quietly at his side
she met his gaze steadily

   youre a wonderful little girl he
whispered to her and then abruptly added
 come on dont make any splash if you
can help it and remember if anything
goes wrong never mind me fly away-if
you can

  they waded slowly into the water the
current carried them rapidly along side
by side with slow careful strokes they
swam keeping close to shore the river
was shallow-hardly over their heads the
water was cold and mercer thought cu-
riously buoyant

  it seemed hardly more than a moment
before the shadowy black figure of outlines
of the boat loomed ahead they could
make out the figure of its single occupant
sitting with his arm on the gunwale they
swam hardly at all now letting the current
carry them forward as silent as two drift-
ing logs they dropped down upon the boat
and in another moment were clinging to a
bit of rope that chanced to be hanging over
its stern

  the bow of the boat was nosed against
the bank it lay diagonally downstream
with its stern some twenty feet from shore
its occupant was sitting amidships facing
the bow mercer drew himself up until his
eyes were above the stem of the boat and
the fire people



saw him plainly he was slouching down
as though dozing his elbow was crooked
carelessly over the gunwale

  mercers heart gave an exultant leap as
he saw a little cylinder in the mans hand

   there was a little projection on the boat
at the water line and working along this
with his hands mercer edged slowly to-
ward the man he knew he could not be
heard for the murmur of the water slipping
past the sides of the boat drowned the slight
noise he made

  he edged his way along with not much
more than his face out of water until he
was directly beneath the motionless form
in the boat

  mercers heart was beating so it seemed
to smother him slowly he pulled himself
up until the fingers of his left hand gripped
the gunwale hardly more than a foot or
two behind the mans back his other hand
reached forward he must have made a
slight noise for the man sat suddenly up-
right listening

  mercers right hand shot out his fin-
gers closed over the little cylinder and the
hand holding it he bent it inward twist-
ing the mans wrist his thumb fumbled
for the little button anina had described
there was a tiny puff of light the mans
body wavered then fell forward inert mer-
cer climbed into the boat he looked back
anina was pulling herself up over the
stem a long pole lay across the seats
he picked it up and started with it toward
ihe bow and then he tripped over some-
thing and fell headlong dropping the pole
with a clatter

  as he picked himself up there came a
shout from the men in the woods mercer
hurried forward and cast off the rope that
held the boat to the bank it had been
tied more or less permanently at this end
s he fumbled at the knots he heard ani-
nas soft anxious voice calling  hurry
ollie hurry

  the shouts from the woods continued
the knots loosened finally the boat
slid back away from the bank with the
pole mercer shoved the bow around an
instant later anina had started the mech-
anism and in a broad curve they swung
silently out into the river

  up from the woods shot a beam of the
greenish-red light it darted to and fro
for an instant almost vertically in the air
and mercer heard the crackle of the tree-
tops as they burst into flame under its heat
then it swung downward but before it
could reach the water level the rise of
ground at the bank cut it off

  without realizing it mercer had been
holding his breath as he watched now he
let it out with a long sigh of relief

   we did it anina-we did it he said
exultantly  and weve got a light-ray
too

  a moment later they swept around a
bend in the river out of sight and out
of hearing of their enemies

chapter xxiii

the storm

ox the little stern seat of the boat
mercer and anina sat side by side
the girl steering by a small tiller
that lay between them they were well
out in the middle of the river now speed-
ing silently along with its swift current
they made extraordinary speed both
banks of the river were visible in the twi-
light-dim wooded hilis stretching back
into darkness

  the stream widened steadily as they ad-
vanced until near its mouth it had become
a broad estuary they followed its right
shore now and soon were out in the narrow
sea

   wed better go right on across said
mercer  its too early for man to be
at the end of the trail he wont be there
till to-night we can reach the great city
before he starts

  they decided to do that and headed
straight out into the sea they had been
cold sitting there in the wind and wet to
the skin but the boat contained several
furry jackets which the men had left in it
and in the bottom near the stern a cubical
metal box which lighted up like an electric
radiator by this they had dried and
warmed themselves and now each with a
fur jacket on they felt thoroughly com-
fortable

  mercer was elated at what they had
accomplished he could see now how for-
tunate a circumstance it was that we had
set the men free he would not have stum-
bled upon this other party and the invasion
of the light country would have begun
had we not released them

  he talked enthusiastically about what
we were to do next and anina listened
saying very little but following his words
with eager attention once he thought she
was more interested in the words themselves
than in what he was saying and said so

   your language-so very easy it is i
want to learn it soon if i can

   why you know it already he pro-
tested  and how the deuce you ever got
it so quickly beats me

  she smiled

   when you say words-very easy then
for me to remember not many words in
spoken language

  he shook his head

   well however you do it the results all
right im mighty glad too why when
i get you back home on earth- he
stopped in sudden confusion

  she put her hand on his arm

   miela says your earth is very wonder-
ful tell me about it

  she listened to his glowing words  and
opera-what is that she asked once when
he paused

  he described the metropolitan opera
house and the newer finer one in boston
she listened to his description of the music
with flushed face and shining eyes

   how beautiful-that music can you
sing ollie

   no he admitted  but i can play a
little on a guitar i wish i had one here
 i can sing said the girl  miela says
i can sing very well

  he leaned toward her brushing the blue
feathers of her wing lightly with his hand

   sing for me he said softly  ill bet
you sing beautifully

  it may have been their situation or what
they had been through together or the
girls nearness to him now with her long
braids of golden hair the graceful sweep
of her blue-feathered wings that matched
the blue of her eyes her red lips parted in

song-but whatever it was mercer thought
he had never heard so sweet a voice she
sang a wjeird little song it was in a minor
key with curious cadences that died away
and ended nowhere-the folk song of a dif-
ferent race a different planet yet vibrant
with the ever unsatisfied longing of the
human soul

   she sang softly staring straight before
her without thought of her singing think-
ing only of her song she ended with a
tender phrase that might have been a sigh-
a quivering little half sob that died away
in her throat and left the song unfinished
her hands were folded quiet in her lap her
eyes gazed out on the gray waste of water
about thejboat

  mercer breathed again

    that is beautiful anina what is it

   she turned to him and smiled

    just love song you like it my friend
ollie

    its wonderful but its-its so sad-
and-and sort of weird isnt it

   that is love my mother says love
is sad

   mercers heart was beating fast

    is it always sad anina i dont think
so-do you

  there wras no trace of coquetry in her
eyes she sighed tremulously

   i do not know about love but what
i feel here -she put her hand on her
breast- i do not understand ollie and
when i sing-they are very sad and sweet
the thoughts of music and they say things
to the neart that the brain does not under-
stand is it that way with you

   unnoticed by the two a storm cloud had
swept up over the horizon behind them
and the sky overhead was blotted now with
its black they had not seen it nor heeded
the distant flashing of lightning a sud-
den thunderclap startled them now into
consciousness of the scene about them the
wind rushed on them from behind the sea
was rising rapidly the boat scudded be-
fore it

   a storm look at it anina behind
us

  there was nothing in sight now but the
gray sea broken into waves that were be-
ginning to curl white and angry behind
the fire people



 them the darkness was split with jagged
 forks of lightning the thunder rolled
 heavily and ominously in the distance with
 occasional sharp cracks near at hand

	 look anina-there comes the rain
 see it there behind us i hope it wont
 be a bad storm i wouldnt want to be out
 in this little tub

    the wind veered to the left increasing
  steadily the sea was lashed into foam
  its spray swept over the boat drenching
  them thoroughly

    the waves turning now with the wind
  struck the boat on its stern quarter one
  curled aboard sloshing an inch or two of
  water about the bottom of the boat mer-
  cer feared it would interfere with the
  mechanism but anina reassured him

    as the waves increased in size mercer
  swung the boat around so as to run directly
  before them the stern frequently was
  lifted clear of the water now the boat losing
  headway as a great cloud of hissing steam
  arose from behind

   after a time the light country shore
 came into sight they were close upon it
 before they saw it through the rain and
 murk they seemed to be heading - diag-
 onally toward it

    where are we anina mercer asked
 anxiously

    the girl shook her head

   steadily they were swept inward the
 shore line as they drew closer was to mer-
 cer quite unfamiliar there were no bayous
 here no inundated land instead a bleak
 line of cliffs fronted them-a perpendicular
 wall against which the waves beat furious-
 ly they could see only a short distance
 the line of cliffs extended ahead of them
 out of sight in the gray of the sheets of
 rain

    they were slanting toward the cliffs and
   mercer knew if he did not do something
   they would be driven against them in a few
   moments more

    well have to turn out anina we
   can t land along here we must keep away
   if we can

    with the waves striking its stern quarter
    again the boat made much heavier weather
    it seemed to mercer incredible that it
    should stay afloat he found himself thor-

oughly frightened now but when he re-
membered that anina was in no danger he
felt relieved he had made her lie down in
the boat where she would be more sheltered
from the wind and rain now he hastily
bade her get up and sit beside him

   we might be swamped any minute
anina you sit there where you wont get
caught if wte go over

  they swept onward mercer keeping the
boat offshore as best he could

   havent you any idea where we are
anina how far along do these cliffs ex-
tend

  a huge jagged pinnacle of rock like a
great cathedral spire set in the cliff loomed
into view ahead aninas face brightened
when she saw it

    the way to the water city she cried

 a river there is-ahead not so very far
now

  in spite of all mercer could do they
were blowing steadily closer to the wave-
lashed cliffs

  he began to despair  if anything hap-
pens anina-you fly up at once you
hear dont you wait you cant help me
any ill make out some way you say
good-by to alan and your mother and sister
for me-if- he fell silent a moment
then said softly  and anina if that
should happen i wrant you to know that
i think youre the sweetest most wonder-
ful little girl i ever met and anina
dear-

  the girl gripped his arm with a cry of
joy

    see ollie there ahead the cliffs end
that is the water city river see it

there

  the mouth of a broad estuary with the
waves rolling up into it came swiftly into
view they rounded the rocky headland
and entered it running now almost directly
before the wind the river narrowed after
a short distance to a stream very much
like the one they had left in the twilight
country

  mercer turned to the quiet little girl
beside him

   well anina weve certainly had some
trip i wouldnt want to go through it

again


argosy-allstory weekly

  mercer thought the situation over they
could stay where they were in the river
for an hour or two until the storm was
entirely over and then go back to the great
city on the other hand now that they
were here mercer felt a great curiosity to
see this other city where taos men had
created trouble why should they not use
these few hours of waiting to see it

   we might get a line on how things
stand up there to tell alan when we get
back mercer said when he explained his
ideas to anina  it wont take long very
probably it was the light-ray cylinder in his
hand which influenced his decision for he
added  we cant get into any trouble
you know theres no light-ray here yet
and so they went on

  there was a perceptible current coming
down the river the water was cold and
clear and in the brighter light now he
could see down into it in many places to the
bottom six or eight feet below the re-
gion seemed utterly uninhabited no sign
of a house or even a boat on the river met
them as they advanced

   mightnt there be boats along here
mercer asked once  how far up is this
place

   not far now-beyond there

the river appeared to terminate abrupt-
ly up ahead against the side of a frowning
brown cliff but mercer saw a moment later
that it opened out around a bend to the left
 around that next bend

  she nodded

  it seemed incredible to mercer that the
second largest city in mercury lay hidden
in the midst of this desolation

   well meet boats he said  what will
the people think of me dont lets start
anything if we can help it

   you lie there anina indicated the
bottom of the boat at her feet  no one
see you then i steer they do not notice
me nobody care who i am

  mercer had still the very vaguest of ideas
as to what they would do when they got to
the water city as a matter of fact he
really was more curious just to see it than
anything else but there was another rea-
son that urged him on both he and anina
were hungry

  they had eaten very little since leaving
the great city the night before and now
that it was again evening they weje fam-
ished they had rummaged the boat thor-
oughly but evidently the men had taken
all their supplies ashore with them for
nothing wras in the boat

   well have to dope out some way to get
something to eat said mercer

  they came upon the sharp bend in the
river anina had indicated following close
against one rocky shore they swept around
the bend and the water city lay spread
out before mercers astonished eyes

chapter xxiv

the water city

it had stopped raining the sky overhead
was luminous with diffused sunlight the
scene that lay before mercer was plainly
visible the river had opened abruptly into
a broad shallow nearly circular lake some
five or six miles across the country here
showed an extraordinary change from that
they had passed through the lake ap-
peared to occupy a depression in the sur-
rounding hills like the bottom of a huge
shallow bowl from the waters edge on all
sides the ground sloped upward it was
no longer a barren rocky land but seem-
ingly covered with a rich heavy soil dotted
with tropical trees that it was under a
high state of cultivation wras evident mer-
cer saw tier upon tier of rice terraces on the
hillsides

  but what astonished him most was the
city itself it covered almost the entire
surface of the lake-a huge collection of
little palm-thatched shacks built upon plat-
forms raised above the water on stilts some
of the houses were larger and built of stone
with their foundations in the water

  off to one side were two or three little
islands an acre or less in extent fringed
with palms and coconut trees in nearly
the center of the lake stood a stone castle
two stories in height with minarets orna-
menting its corners an opfcn stretch of
water surrounded it

  there was little of regularity about this
extraordinary city and no evidence of
the fire people



streets for the houses were set down quite
haphazard wherever open space afforded
in some places they were more crowded
together than others although seldom closer
than twenty or thirty feet

  around the larger ones there was a little
more open water as though the owners
controlled it and forbade building there
some of the smaller houses were connected
by little wooden bridges anina said this
was where two or more families of rela-
tives had located together

  there were a few boats moving about-
little punts hollowed out of logs and pro-
pelled by long poles-and mercer saw
many others some of them larger like the
one he and anina were in tied up by the
houses it was now the time of the eve-
ning meal the workers had returned from
the terraces there were few moving about
the city occasionally a girl would dart up
from one of the houses and wing her way to
another but beyond that there were no
signs of activity

  anina took command of the boat now
slowing it down and heading for the nearest
of the houses which were hardly more than
quarter of a mile away mercer stretched
himself out in the bottom of the boat cov-
ering himself with a large piece of fabric
that lay there he felt that he would be
unnoticed even should a girl chance to pass
directly overhead but he could see noth-
ing of the city from where he was and
soon grew restless and anxious to do some-
thing else

   im coming up anina he said once
 shucks nobody can do anything to us
havent i got this light-ray

  but anina was obdurate and made him
stay where he was

  they went slowly forward and were soon
among the houses on the front platform
of one a man sat fishing a little naked
boy slid down into the water from another
swimming as though born to the water
both stared at anina curiously as she
passed slowly by but they said nothing a
girl looked out of the window of another
house and waved her hand in friendly
greeting which anina answered

  mercer lying with all but his face cov-
ered by the cloth could see only the sides

of the boat the bottom of the cross-seat
over his head and anina as she sat above
him in the stern

   where do you suppose the tao people
hang out around here he suddenly asked
 if we could-

  the girl silenced him with a gesture

  he lowered his voice  try and find out
where they are anina he whispered

  anina steered the boat directly under
several of the houses which must have been
quite a usual proceeding for it attracted
no attention a girl flew close to them
once and anina called to her the girl
alighted on the stern of the boat for a mo-
ment mercer slid the cloth over his face
and held himself motionless then he heard
aninas voice calling to him softly he slid
the cloth back the girl had gone

   she says taos men live there-large
house of wood said anina pointing off to
one side

  mercer nearly rapped his head against
the seat above him in his excitement

   you know which house lets go there
maybe we can hear what theyre saying
can we get under it

  she nodded

   lets try anina he said eagerly
 you steer us slow right under it just as
if you were going past if theres nobody
in sight you can stop underneath cant
you maybe we can hear what theyre
saying

   i try the girl said simply

   ill lay still encouraged mercer
 nobody will bother about you just sneak
in and see what happens if anybody sees
you keep going

  he was all excitement and in spite of
aninas protests wriggled about continual-
ly trying to see where they were

  the house that the girl had pointed out
lay only a few hundred yards ahead it
was one of the largest of the wooden build-
ings-sixty or seventy feet long at least-
single story with a high sloping thatched
roof

  it was raised on a platform some six feet
above the water which in front had a
little flight of wooden steps leading down
to the surface there was a hundred feet
of open water on all sides of the building

the boat moving slowly slipped through
the water almost without a sound

   where are we now mercer whispered
impatiently  arent we there yet

  the girl put a finger to her lips  almost
there quiet now

  she steered straight for the house
there wras no one in sight either about the
house itself or about those in its immediate
vicinity a moment more and the boat slid
beneath the building into semidarkness

  anina shut the power off and stood up
the floor of the house was just above her
head in front of her near the center of
the building she saw the side walls of an
inner inclosure some twenty feet square
these walls came down to the surface mak-
ing a room like a basement to the dwelling
a broad doorway with a sliding door that
now stood open gave ingress

  the boat had now almost lost headway
anina nosed its bow into this doorway and
grasping one of the pilings near at hand
brought it to rest

  mercer at a signal from her climbed
cautiously to his feet still holding the little
light-ray cylinder in his hand

   whats that in there he whispered

  beyond the doorway through which the
bow of the boat projected there was com-
plete darkness

   lower room anina whispered back
 store things in there and boat landing
too

   lets go in and see

  mercer started toward the bow of the
boat six feet or more of it was inside
the doorway he made his way carefully
into the bow and found himself inside the
basement of the house

  in the dimness of this interior he could
just make out the outlines of things around
the doorway was located at a corner of the
inclosure in front lay a small open space
of water at one side a platform about
two feet above the surface formed the floor
of the room a tiny punt lay moored to it
farther back a small steep flight of steps
led up through a rectangular opening to
the building above

  most of the light in this lower room came
down through this opening and now as
mercer stood quiet looking about him he

could hear plainly the voices of men in the
room above

  anina was beside him

   theyre up there he whispered point-
ing  lets land and see if we can get up
those stairs a ways and hear what theyre
saying

  they stood a moment undecided and
then from the silence and darkness about
them they distinctly heard a low muftled
sound

   whats that whispered mercer star-
tled  didnt you hear that anina
theres something over there by the bottom
of the steps

  they listened but only the murmur of
the voices from above and an occasional
footstep broke the stillness

   i tell you i heard something mercer
persisted  theres something over there
he rattled a bit of rope incautiously as if
to startle a rat from its hiding place
 lets tie up anina

  they made the boat fast but in such a
way that they could cast it loose quickly

   we might wrant to get out of here in a
hurry mercer whispered with a grin
 you never can tell anina

  he stood stock still the sound near at
hand was repeated it was unmistakable
this time-a low stifled moan

  mercer stepped lightly out of the boat
onto the platform a few boxes a coil of
rope and other odds and ends stood about
he felt his way forward among them to-
w-ard the bottom of the steps he heard the
moan again and now he saw the outlines
of a human figure lying against the farther
wall

  anina w-as close behind him

   theres somebody over there he
whispered  hurt or sick maybe

  they crept forward

  it was a woman bound hand and foot
and gagged mercer bent over and tore
the cloth from her face in another instant
anina was upon her knees sobbing softly
with her mothers head in her lap

  they loosed the cords that held her and
chaffed her stiffened limbs she soon re-
covered for she was not injured she told
anina her story then-howt baar had cap-
tured her in her home w-hile she was waiting
the fire people



for miela and me and how two of his men
had brought her here to the water city
by boat at once

  that was all she knew except that this
house was the headquarters of taos emis-
saries who it appeared were now allied
with baar and his party

  anina whispered all this to mercer when
her mother had finished

   lets get out of here said mercer

  the responsibility of two women espe-
cially the elder lua who could not fly
weighed suddenly upon him and his first
thought was to get back to the great city
at once

  anina helped her mother into the boat

   wait she whispered to mercer  i
hear what they say you wait here

  she went to the foot of the steps and
began climbing them cautiously

   not on your life i wont wait here
mercer muttered to himself and gripping
the light-ray cylinder firmly as though he
feared it might get away from him he
joined anina on the stairway

  slowly cautiously they made their way
upward the steps were fairly wide and
they went up almost side by side from
near the top they could see a portion of the
room above

  the corner of a table showed around
which a number of men were gathered eat-
ing a woman was moving about the room
serving them

  their words from here were plainly au-
dible mercer would have gone a step or
two higher without thought of discovery
but anina held him back  wait ollie

i	hear now what they say

  they stood silent the men were talk-

  ing earnestly mercer could hear their
words but of course understood nothing he
heard

   what do they say anina he whis-
pered impatiently after a moment

   baar is here with two or three of his
men he talks with taos men they
talk about men from twilight country
waiting for them now speak of storm
worried-because men do not come wait-
ing for light-ray

   theyll have a long wait mercer
chuckled  lets get out of here anina

  he must have made a slight noise or
perhaps he and anina crouching there on
the staire were seen by some one above
he never knew quite how it occurred but
without warning a man stood at the open-
ing looking down at them

  there was a shout and the room above
was in instant turmoil mercer lost his
head anina pulled at him and said some-
thing but he did not hear her he only
knew that they had been discovered and
that most of their enemies in the water
city were crowded together in this one
room at hand and he had the light-ray-
the only one in the city

  a sudden madness possessed him he
tore away from anina and climbing up the
steps of the stairway leaped into the room
above

  twenty or thirty men faced him most
of them about the table several had start-
ed hastily to their feet two or three chairs
were overturned

  the man who had been looking down into
the opening darted back as mercer came up
and shouted again

  mercer saw it was baar

the adventures of peabody smith



  the central figure in the interesting busi-
ness was amos briggs a young fanner from
one of the rural counties up the state and a
newly elected member of the assembly
when amos reached albany for the first
time in his life he was as green as the grass
on his well-cultivated farm and just as at-
tractive and wholesome he was a small
man with a smooth-shaven face tanned by
much exposure to the elements he was
awkward in his movements but he had more
than his share of native shrewdness and he
possessed a most ingratiating personality

in other words five minutes after you met
amos you like him and wanted to know
him better he looked at you out of a pair
of sky-blue eyes and when he smiled it
warmed you like a bit of sunshine on a
dreary day

  his coming to albany was in celebration
of two very important events in his other-
wise prosaic life the first one was his elec-
tion as a member of the assembly and
the second was his marriage if he had told
you himself he would have put his marriage
as first in importance and his election sec-
ond at all events he brought his blushing
bride with him on what he was pleased to
call his honeymoon

  and blushing in this case is no mere figure
of speech because the roses that came and
went on the cheeks of jenny briggs were the
products of dame nature and depended
not at all on the powder box or the rouge
pot she was exceedingly proud of amos
and looked upon him as another daniel
webster a flattering opinion that was never
for a moment shared by the young farmer-
statesman she interested herself in his
work and soon became fairly conversant
with the meaning of politics she even went
so far as to give an afternoon tea to the
wives of some of the other members on
which occasion she served salad sandwiches
with a new kind of home dressing that made
her the envy of all her guests

    it was when the session was about five
  weeks old that the cloud no bigger than a
  mans hand appeared on the political hori-
  zon it came with the introduction of the
  bill consolidating certain public utilities and
  it was fathered by edward knight man of
  affairs and president of the monroe trac-

  tion company on its face it was a reason-
  able piece of legislation but when colonel
  william hartman began to work for its
  passage peabody smith became suspicious

  hartman was a professional lobbyist he
was a big broad-shouldered man well
groomed with a brown mustache waxed to
a perfect point he was suave but force-
ful and had the reputation of always carry-
ing everything before him there were
other persuasive gentlemen who solicited
votes for various dubious measures but they
were as novices when compared with col-
onel hartman no one knew where he had
received his military title but all agreed
that he was the king of lobbyists

  one day mrs henry maynes wife of the
floor leader called on jenny briggs and in-
vited the little lady and her husband to take
dinner with herself and her husband that
evening jenny was all in a flutter and
spent many anxious moments in deciding
what she would wear on that auspicious
occasion when the time arrived they found
themselves in a private dining room in the
hotel and a little later were served with a
repast that would have tickled the palate
of the most confirmed diner-out

  it was a small party mr and mrs
maynes mr and mrs briggs and colonel
william hartman the lobbyist was the
joker in the deck he devoted himself
painstakingly to mrs briggs before long
they discovered that they were old friends
he was born and raised in the same county
with her he remembered that he had
taken her to a dance and before the dinner
was over he was jokingly reproving amos
briggs for having robbed him of the girl
of his heart it was when the ice cream
was being served that the bill of the mon-
roe traction company came up for dis-
cussion the merits of the measure were
glowingly explained and colonel hartman
ended by asking amos briggs to vote for it

   amos and jenny were both glowing with
  the unwonted excitement of the banquet
  the fine linen the beautiful flowers the
  music from an adjoining room all tended
  to make them happy and complaisant but
  the bump of caution was well developed in
  the young farmer-legislator and he declined
  to be drawn into any trap he refused to


argosy-allstory weekly

 pledge his vote but agreed to give the meas-
 ure his consideration and when he walked
 home with his bride that night he was in a
 very thoughtful frame of mind

   the next day he looked further into the
 matter and the more he learned about the
 bill the less he liked it as time wore on he
 met colonel hartman frequently and that
 gentleman was always courteous and affable
 -and never mentioned the bill of the mon-
 roe traction company amos became very
 quiet and jenny watched him as a bird
 watches its young and knew what he was
 thinking about

   for the first time in their brief married
 life he failed to confide in her and this dis-
 turbed jenny mightily could it be pos-
 sible that a bill over which men were dis-
 puting so loudly would disturb the serenity
 of their domestic bliss once after this
 jenny gave a little luncheon to mr and
 mrs maynes tactfully enough she had
 omitted colonel hartman from her guests
 the man evidently disturbed amos and for
 this reason she did not propose to have him
 at her table in spite of this concession
 amos was moody and absent-minded and
 scarcely spoke during the meal before
 they separated he asked maynes some ques-
 tions regarding the monroe traction bill
 and seemed to ponder a long while over the
 answers

   in the meanwhile peabody smith at his
 end of the capitol was watching the bill like
 a hawk and was keeping colonel william
 hartman in sight he knew that the friends
 of the measure and its opponents had
 counted noses and that they were just
 about evenly divided a wave of the hand
 in either direction might determine the re-
 sult the passage or the defeat of the bill
 might depend upon a single vote

   the long-legged detective mingled with
 the members looked at them in his sad way
 smiled occasionally but was as silent as the
 grave and seemed to absorb information
 through the pores of his skin he had
 learned a great deal about colonel william
 hartman but he lacked the final convinc-
 ing bit of proof that would put that gentie-
 man out of business and smash the albany
 lobby there were times when he thought
 that amos briggs might be the instrument

 he needed and then again he was fearful
 to put the young man to the test he had
 known so many promising legislators to suc-
 cumb to temptation

   it was on a monday afternoon just be-
 fore the final adjournment of the legislature
 that peabody sat in the little office near the
 capitol he had accomplished something
 for the good government league but with
 colonel hartman at large and flourishing
 he could not help feeling that his stay at
 albany was somewhat of a failure the
 manner in which hartman had greased the
 ways for the monroe traction bill proved
 that he was a master in his art the bill
 had passed first and second reading and in
 the morning it would come up for third
 reading and final passage

   peabody smith knew that both sides ex-
 pected to win but he felt gloomily enough
 that colonel hartman was going to carry
 home the bacon the battle was dangerous-
 ly close many members were away but
 the latest calculation showed eighty for and
 eighty against the bill that took no ac-
 count of amos briggs

   and his report had amos briggs on the
 fence

   he wanted to talk to the young fanner
 and yet he did not know just how to ap-
 proach him it is not quite the thing to go
 to a man and ask him if he is honest while
 he sat there deliberating with half-closed
 eyes there was a gentle tap on the door
 and in walked jenny briggs it was like an
 answer to a prayer

   peabody smith was on his feet in an in-
 stant tendering her a chair he noticed
 that her face was very white and that she
 looked tired but there was determination
 in her eyes and something very like strength
 in theway she held her chin she smiled
 feebly

    you know me she said in a low voice
  i dont have to introduce myself

    i should say not protested the de-
 tective as he favored her with one of his
 rare grins  and now tell me what i can
 do for you

     i want your advice she began quickly
  amos might not like my coming here but
 im doing it for his sake as well as my own
 im sure we can trust you and that you will
the adventures of peabody smith

lit

 protect us maybe im all wrong but after
 you hear you can tell better than any one
 in albany

   its about the monroe traction bill
ventured peabody with gleaming teeth and
a fatherly smile

   how did you know that she cried
startled

   im sort of a mind reader he con-
fessed  and besides ive been keeping ray
eyes on things thats why im here

   well you are right ive tried to find
out how amos was going to vote on that
bill and he refused to tell me he was real
cross about it-the first time hes been cross
with me since we were married he said i
must mind my own business and not mix
in politics as a matter of fact i dont
care how he votes but im anxious about
him my friends have been telling me that
no matter what he does he will be sure to
get in wrong what does that mean

  the innocence with which she asked this
question with upturned eyes made pea-
body smith laugh he was sorry the mo-
ment he did so and spoke to her gently

   thats a political phrase he explained
 and it means that he will place himself in
a false position but whether he does de-
pends entirely on himself what else do
you hear

   i was also told she continued with the
air of a child making a confession  that
colonel hartman had chalked my husbands
hat i dont know what that means and i
was ashamed to ask

   its mere political lingo said the detec-
tive  and you have no reason to be
ashamed of your ignorance to be brutally
frank it is the business of colonel hart-
man to get votes for the monroe traction
bill if necessary he pays members to vote
for it sometimes a member votes for a bill
voluntarily and the lobbyist claims credit
for having won his vote in other words
he  collects  for having influenced that
vote thats what they mean when they
say his hat has been chalked he is un-
conscious of the fact that some unscrupu-
lous lobbyist is using his vote as a commod-
ity do you get the idea

  jenny briggs flushed and involuntarily
put her hands to her face

   oh isnt that perfectly dreadful i was
afraid that hartman was engaged in some
underhand business and the mean part of
it is that he is using his former ac-
quaintance with me to injure my husband
im perfectly sure that amos is as hon-
est as the day is long but i am afraid
that hartman will try to get him in what
you call a false position i met him a little
while ago and he asked me to tell amos
that he was coming to see him to-night i
dont know what to do and that is why i
came to see you

   my advice is to let him see your hus-
band it can do no harm and it may do
some good we will catch this rat in a
trap

   but i dread the publicity

  peabody smith did some quick thinking
he looked jenny briggs in the eyes

   mrs briggs he said finally  i have
perfect confidence in your husband just as
i have in you that meeting must take
place your husband should have a wit-
ness because hartman would swear to any-
thing let things take their course and
ill guarantee that there will be no publicity
-at least none of the kind that you dread
he walked to the door with her and tried
to reassure her but she went away very
much distracted and wondering if she had
not made a bad situation worse

ii

  at eight oclock that evening amos
briggs sat at a little desk in the living room
of their apartment industriously writing
his wife not far away was engaged on
some fancy lace work she looked at him
anxiously from time to time and wondered
whether she dared speak of the monroe
traction bill and of colonel william hart-
man she had not told him of hartmans
intention to call and she was wondering if
she had made a mistake sometimes they
went to the movies together and as she sat
there she was hoping that he might pro-
pose to go and see a picture it was not
too late and if he happened to be out when
hartman called it might change the whole
course of their lives jenny briggs did not
pretend to be a philosopher but she knew


argosy-allstory weekly

 that great issues sometimes depended on
 small events suddenly he turned and
 looked at her over his shoulder

    oh by the way jenny i expect col-
 onel hartman to come in to see me this
 evening

   she flushed at the announcement it
 was as though amos had accused her of de-
 ceit he knew that hartman was coming
 and she had said nothing about it but if
 there was any hidden meaning behind his
 words it was not to be detected in his man-
 ner already he had resumed his writing
 she felt that she must make some response

    some business i suppose she ven-
 tured v some political business

   he nodded without turning his head

    yes political business and possibly
 something that may be very important to
 me personally

   she felt her heart sinking

    maybe you would like me to go out-
 maybe you would like to see colonel hart-
 man alone

   he seemed to be deliberating

    now that you mention it he replied
 slowly measuring his words  it might be
 just as well for you to remain here

   that helped to calm her beating heart
 but only for a moment

    it might be well amos was saying
  if you would make up a few of those salad
 sandwiches for which you are famous col-
 onel hartman likes them very much im
 going to offer him one of them i wouldnt
 want him to think that we were lacking in
 hospitality

   her heart felt like lead now how could
 amos take that tone toward a man who was
 so well known as the king of the lobby-
 ists she felt that she was on the verge
 of hysteria she did not know whether
 to laugh or cry at that moment there was
 a tap on the door and colonel hartman
 entered the room

   he was in the pink of condition and bub-
 bling over with good nature as always he
 was well groomed his tailor had somehow
 managed to cover his two hundred pounds
 of flesh so that he seemed youthful and the
 picture of style his broad shoulders were
 well thrown back and he walked with a
 springy step although the snow was on

 the ground he wore a red rose in his button-
 hole a man-on the surface at least-to
 be admired and envied

   amos briggs arose slowly to meet his
 guest and as the two stood facing each
 other it was impossible not to contrast them
 amos was small-so small that he seemed
 undersized yet this was more of an impres-
 sion than a fact his weather-beaten face
 was undeniably homely his clothes fit him
 badly and candor compels the admission
 that his trousers were very much bagged at
 the knees he did not shine as he stood be-
 side the bluff hearty man of the world he
 pointed to a chair and the colonel sat down
 with the air of a man who was at peace
 with all the world

    a pretty picture of domesticity he
 boomed over at jenny  with the head of
 the house engaged in the tasks of a law-
 maker and the wife doing her little house-
 hold chores

    jenny smiled but inwardly she was ill at
 ease colonel hartman turned to amos
 with his most businesslike manner

    speaking of lawmaking we are count-
 ing on you to vote for the monroe traction
 bill its a good thing for the state and it
 will be a good thing for your district but
 i didnt come to talk of the merits of the
 bill you know all about that im here
 to let you know that we are not insensible
 of the good will of our friends

   amos who had seated himself remained
 silent at this outburst the colonel looked
 in the direction of jenny briggs

    i suppose-ah-that we can talk freely
 in the presence of the little lady

   something like a grin hovered around the
 lips of amos briggs

    i always do he said dryly

    very good very good  exclaimed the
 colonel as though greatly relieved  now
 i was going to say that it is quite possible
 that you may have a mortgage on the farm
 wouldnt it be a fine thing to lift the in-
 cumbrance and to take a fresh start it is
 no joke to go on farming year after year
 with a thing like that-

    my farm interrupted amos  is per-
 fectly clear

   the colonel was disconcerted but only
 for a moment

                             a
the adventures

i 

  fine fine he cried you always
were a thriftyfellow congratulations but
we all need money for one reason or an-
other that reminds me you have just
been married why not take a long wed-
ding trip you ought to go to niagara and
all the other places give the little lady a
little treat eh what you are think-
ing that vacation trips cost money

   yes replied amos meditatively

 they do take money

   sometimes persisted the colonel

  they take a lot of money

   yes assented the little man with mo-
 notonous iteration  sometimes they take
 a lot of money

  the colonel was positively beaming now

   that he said  explains my presence
 here this evening you can turn your head
 away and im going to lay something on
 your desk you dont see me put it there
 and i wont see you pick it up nobody
 will be the wiser i hope you get me

  amos stared at colonel hartman while he
 spoke and presently the lobbyist opened his
 coat and pulled out a long wallet he
 reached in and carefully brought out a one-
 thousand-dollar bank note and laid it on
 the edge of the little desk amos gazed
 on it like a man fascinated then the
 tempter brought out another until five crisp
 notes of the same denomination lay there in
 a heap

  the colonel put his wallet back in his
 jxjcket and arose with the smile of a phil-
 anthropist on his broad face he made a
 gesture of farewell that was intended to in-
 clude them both and then exclaimed

   now what do you think of your friend
 colonel hartman

  jenny briggs on the other side of the
 room watched this performance with the in-
 tensified interest of a spectator at a play
 her heart went pit-a-pat and an invisible
 hand seemed to be clutching at her throat
 she tried to speak but her voice failed her
 it suddenly seemed to her that amos was
 drowning and that she was powerless to
 save him she was gazing at him out of
 distended eyes when he slowly arose and
 faced the big man he licked his lips
 with the tip of his tongue and began to
 speak very slowly

   youve asked me a question be said

 and im going to answer it i think you
are a dirty cur you have the shape of a
man but you are not a man at all i

wouldnt use you to wipe my feet on ive
known this was coming for a long time but
i wondered whether youd have the nerve
to go ahead with it

  colonel hartman looked at the little far-
mer as if he thought he had gone mad he
heard his opening sentence with amazement
as amos went on the face of the lobbyist
turned white and a sickly smile gathered
about his lips

   do-do i understand that you dont
want the money he managed to say

   understand shouted amos raising his
voice  why you white-livered black-
hearted double-faced snake-eyed crawling
son of a sea cook i wouldnt touch your
tainted money with a forty-foot pole 

   not so loud cautioned the colonel his
lips trembling  some one will hear you

   i want to be heard shouted amos his
eyes flashing and his tanned face reddening

 im sick and tired of your whispering
and your lick-spittle talk ive got some
things to tell you and i want you to listen

   i think id better be going said hart-
man with a badly forced laugh we-we
dont seem to be getting along

   jenny cried amos turning suddenly
to his wife  lock the door ive got a few
arguments to present to this fake colonel
and i dont want him to leave until i get
through

   what do you mean by arguments
said hartman his face as white as a sheet

   these exulted amos lifting his two
sturdy arms in the air  two of the most
convincing arguments you ever listened to
theyre not the kind youre accustomed to
and they may do you a lot of good

    jenny briggs in a sudden access of joy
had turned the key in the lock and slipped
it in her pocket her heart was beating
but it was with exultation amos had not
failed her and she was enjoying the hap-
piest moment of her life the thought that
he might be in personal danger never oc-
curred to her

     get over nearer the light thundered
  amos to hartman

   as he moved slightly the young farmer
gave him a wallop in the jaw that sent him
staggering into the corner he recovered
and coming toward amos doubled his fist
menacingly

    youve invited violence he quivered
 and you-youll have to take the conse-
quences

    consequences hell screamed the now
thoroughly aroused one  why you
havent the courage of a cat youre a
stuffed shirt youre a big worm and
then words failing him he pitched in and
gave the big man a drubbing that blacked
his eyes caused his nose to bleed and left
him all but a physical wreck

  he sat down panting while hartman
with all of the dignity he was able to as-
sume took out his handkerchief and wiped
his hands and nose then getting up he
walked toward the table and reached for
the five one-thousand-dollar bills

    hands off  shouted amos

  hartman looked amazed and then a
sneer began to curl about his bruised lips

    so he said huskily  you are going to
take the money after all

    no replied amos  but i cant let you
go without showing you a little hospitality
then turning to his wife he said  jenny
lets have one of your sandwiches for col-
onel hartman

   daintily she tripped to the rear of the
room and brought two tiny slices of bread
with a leaf of lettuce and covered with her
incomparable dressing amos took the food
and opening the slices of bread deftly in-
serted the bank notes from the table

    now he said handing the remarkable
sandwich to the lobbyist  eat that

   what-do-do you mean stammered
hartman trembling

    just what i say i made you eat your
words and now im going to make you
eat your bribe

    youre crazy cried hartman  youve
done enough without this nonsense

  there was murder in the eyes of amos
briggs but he spoke evenly

    eat that and eat it right away or ill
beat you to a pulp as theres a god above
me i mean what i say

   colonel hartman felt the apprehension
that one feels in the presence of a violent
lunatic and humiliating and absurd as it
was he slowly ate every crumb of the most
expensive sandwich ever prepared in al-
bany as he finished amos took the key
from jenny whistled down the corridor and
the next moment peabody smith entered
the room smilingly

    did he eat it he asked significantly
 yes smiled amos  and enjoyed it
dont you notice him licking his lips

  the detective turned on hartman and
spoke to him in the tone of a judge address-
ing the prisoner at the bar

    hartman he said  theres a train
leaving here to-night if you are not out
of the city and state in twelve hours ill
send you to the penitentiary

   for a moment the bedraggled one made a
show of resistance

    ill-ill not stand for this outrage
he cried  ill tell the whole story
peabody smith laughed

    what tell the truth and make your-
self the joke of the whole state you know
better than that hartman

   the king of the lobbyists confessed de-
feat for he turned and slunk out of the
room like a dog with its tail between its
legs

  the next morning when the monroe
traction bill came up for final passage
amos briggs voted  no in a voice that
could be heard all over the chamber and
the measure went down to merited defeat
the most astonished man in the state capi-
tal was mr edward knight president of
the monroe traction company he shook
his head as one who has lost faith in human
nature

    they told me in the beginning he con-
fided to a mutual friend  that hartman
had chalked the hat of this man briggs
but to make sure he went to see him last
night now hartman has disappeared and
i cant make head or tail out of the busi-
ness i trusted him implicitly and now hes
run away with my five thousand dollars
and for years that was exactly what
everybody connected with the assembly
firmly believed

the freedom of hunsa

and hunsa knew his evil swarthy
face turned as green as the slime on
l the crocodiles forehead his power-
ful naked shoulders seemed to shrivel and
shrink as though blood had ceased to flow
through his veins he put his two hands
clasped palm to palm to his forehead in
supplication and begged that the ordeal
might pass that he might go by the bridge
or across the desert or any way except by
that pool of horrors

  kassim again swept his hand toward the
river and his voice was horrible in its dead-
liness  these children of the poor that
are sacred to some of thy gods infidel have
been fed five goats have been allotted them
as sacrifice and they wait for thee they

serve allah and not thy gods to-day go
murderer for we wait go unless thou art
not only a murderer but a coward for it is
the only way it was promised that no
pindari should wound or kill thee dog but
they will help thee on thy way

   hunsa at this drew himself up his gorilla
face seemed to fill out with resolve he
swept the vast throng of horsemen with
his eyes and realized that it was indeed
true-there was nothing left but the pool
and the faint faint chance that powerful
swimmer that he was and with the knife
he might cross once his evil eyes rested
on kassim and involuntarily a hand
twitched toward the dagger hilt but at
that instant he was pinioned both arms
by a pindari on either side then stand-
ing rigid he said

   i am hunsa a bagree a servant of

rhowanee i am not afraid may she
bring the black plague upon all the pin-
daris who are dogs that worship a false
god

  he strode toward the water the soldiers
still a hand on either arm marching be-
side him on the clay bank he put his
hands to his forehead calling in a loud
voice  kali mia receive me then he
plunged head first into the pool

  a cry of  allah allah went up from
ten thousand throats as the bagree shot
from view smothered in the foam of the
ruffled stream and beyond the waters
were churned by huge ghoulish forms that
the blood of goats had gathered there five
yards from the bank the ugly head of
hunsa appeared a brown arm flashed
once in the fingers clutched a knife that
seemed red with fresh blood the water
was lashed to foam the tail of a giant
mugger shot out and struck flat upon the
surface of the river like the crack of a
pistol again the head and then the shoul-
ders of the swimmer were seen and as if
something dragged the torso below two
legs shot out from the water gyrated spas-
modically and disappeared

  barlow waited his soul full of horror
but there was nothing more just a little
lower down in the basin of the sluggish pool
two bulbous protrusions above the water
where some crocodile either gorged or dis-
appointed floated lazily

  a ghastly silence reigned-no one spoke
ten thousand eyes stared out across the
pool

  then the voice of kassim was heard
solemn and deep saying  the covenant
has been kept and allah has avenged the
death of amir khan

chapter xxv

the quality of breeding

commander kassim touched bar-
low on the arm  captain sahib
come with me the death of that
foul murderer does not take the weight off
our hearts

   he deserved it barlow declared
  though filled with a sense of shuddering

horror he was compelled involuntarily to
admit that it had been a most just punish-
ment less brutal even more impressive-
almost taking on the aspect of a religious
execution-than if the bagree had been
tortured to death hacked to pieces by the
tulwars of the outraged pindaris he had
been executed with no evidence of passion
in those who witnessed his death and as
to the subtlety of the commander in ob-
taining that confession that too accord-
ing to the ethics of hindustan was meri-
torious not a thing to be condemned
hunsas animal cunning had been over-
matched by the clear intellect of this wise
soldier

   we will walk back to the chamber of
audience kassim said  for now there are
things to relate

   he spoke to a soldier to have his horse
led behind and as they walked he ex-
plained  with us sahib as at the death
of a rana of mewar there is no interreg-
num the dead wait upon the living for it
is dangerous that no one leads even for an
hour men whose guard is their sword so
amir khan waits yonder where his body
lies to be taken on his way to the arms of
allah in paradise they who have the wel-
fare of our people at heart have selected
one to lead and one and all the jamadars
and the hazaris have decreed that i shall
unworthily sit upon the throne that was
amir khans though with us it is but the
back of a horse and we have taken un-
der advisement the message thou brought
it has come in good time for the mahrattas
are like wolves that have turned upon each
other sindhia rao holkar both eaten by
your armies now fight among themselves
and suck like vampires the life blood of the
rajputs and holkar has become insane
but lately retreating through mewar he
went to the shrine of krishna and prostrat-
ing himself before his heathen image re-
viled the god as the cause of his disaster
when the priests aghast at the profanity
expostulated he levied a fine of three hun-
dred thousand rupees upon them and
when fearing an outrage to the image these
infidels call a god they sent the idol to
udaipur he waylaid the men who had
taken it and slew them to a man
caste



   your knowledge of affairs is great
chief barlow commented for most of this

was new to him

   yes captain sahib we pindaris ride
north and east and south and west we
are almost as free as the eagles of the air
claiming that our home is where our cook-
ing pots are we do not trust to ramparts
such as fort chitor where we may be
cooped up and slain-such as the rajputs
have been three times in the three famed
sacks of chitor-but also sahib this is all
wrong

  the chief halted and swept an arm in an
encompassing embrace of the tent-studded
plain

   we are not a nation to muster an army
because now the cannon that belch forth a
shower of death mow horsemen down like
ripened grain it was the dead chiefs am-
bition but it is wrong

  barlow was struck with the wise logic of
this tall wide-browed warrior-it was
wrong massed together pindaris and
bundoolas assailed by the trained hordes
of mahrattas with their french and portu-
guese gunners and officers would be
slaughtered like sheep and against the
war-trained line regiments of the british
foot soldiers they would meet the same
fate

   you are right chief kassim barlow
declared  even if you cut in writh the win-
ning side especially sindhia he would turn
on you and devour you and your people

   yes sahib the trade of a pindari if
 may call it so has been that of loot in
this land that has always been a land of
strife for possession i rode with chitu as
a jamadar when we swept through the
nizams territory and put cities under a
tribute of many lakhs but that was a force
of five thousand only and we swooped
the land like a great flock of hawks but
even at that chitu a wonderful chief was
killed by wild animals in the jungle when
he was fleeing from disaster almost alone
they were now close to the palace and
as they entered just within the great hall
kassim said  there will be nothing to
say on thy part captain sahib the offi-
cers will come even now to the audience and
it is all agreed upon thou wilt be given an

assurance to take back to the british for
by chance the others have put great confi-
dence in me even more in a matter of diplo-
macy than they had in the dead leader
may allah rest his soul 

   and to the audience chamber-where he
had sat oft-two long rows of minor chiefs
at their head on a raised dais the rajput
raja a sessodia one of the  children of
the sun as the flaming yellow gypsum
sun above the dais attested-now came in
twos and threes the wild-eyed whiskered
riders of the desert they were lean raw-
boned steel-muscled tall solemn-faced
men their eyes set deep in skin wrinkled
from the scorch of sun on the white sands
of the desert and their eyes beneath the
black brows were like a falcons predatory
like those of birds of prey and the air of
freedom of self-reljance of independence
was in every look in the firm swinging
stride and erect set of the shoulders they
wrere men to swear by or to fear verily
men and somehow one sharp look of ap-
praisement and one and all would have
sworn by allah that the sahib in the garb
of an afghan was a man

   as each one entered he strode to the cen-
ter of the room drew himself erect facing
the heavy curtain beyond which lay the
dead chief and raising a hand to brow said
in a deep voice  salaam amir khan
and may the peace of allah be upon thy
spirit

    now brothers kassim said when the
curtain entrance had ceased to be thrust
to one side  we will say what is to be
said one will stand guard just without
for this is a matter for the officers alone

   he took from his waist the silver chain
and unlocked the iron box brought forth
the paper that barlow had carried and
holding it aloft said  this is the message
of brotherhood from the english raj are
ye all agreed that it is acceptable to our
people

    in the name of allah we are came as
 a sonorous chorus from one and all

    and are ye agreed that it shall be said
 to the captain sahib who is envoy from
 the englay that we ride in peace to his
 people or ride not at all in war

    allah it is agreed came the response


argosy-allstory weekly

   he turned to barlow  captain sahib
thou hast heard the word of a pindari
taken in the name of allah is inviolate
that is our answer to the message from
the englay chief there is no writing to
be given for a pindari deals in yea and
nay is it to be considered captain sahib
is it a message to send that is worthy of
men to men

    it is commander kassim barlow an-
swered

    then wait thou for the seal

   he raised his tulwar aloft-and as he did
 so the steel of every jamadar and hazari
 flashed upward-saying  we pindaris and
 bundoolas who rode for amir khan and
 now ride for kassim swear in the name of
 allah and on the beard of mahomet who
 is his prophet friendship to the englay
 raj

    by allah and the beard of mahomet
who is his prophet we make oath the
deep voices boomed solemnly

    it is all kassim said quietly  i
would make speech for a little with the
captain

   as each officer passed toward the door he
 held out a hand and gripped the hand of
 the englishman

   when they had gone kassim said  go
thou back sahib to the one who is to re-
ceive our answer and let our promise be
sent to the one who commands the englay
army and is even now at tonk in mewar
for the purpose of putting the mahrattas
to the sword tell the sahib to strike and
drive the accursed dogs from mewar and
have no fear that the pindaris will fall upon
his flank even also our tulwars and our
spears are ready for service so be it there is
a reward in lands and gold

   the pindari chief paced the marble floor
 twice then with his eyes watching the ef-
 fect of his words in the face of barlow he
 said  captain sahib it is of an affair of
 feeling i would speak now it relates to
 the woman who has done us all a service
 which but shows what a perception amir
 khan had a glance and he knew a man
 for what he was therein was his power
 over the pindaris and it seems which is
 rarer that he knew what was in the heart
 of a woman for the gulab is one to rouse

in a man desire and i myself years of
hard riding and combat having taken me
out of my colt days wondered why the
chief being busy otherwise and a man of
short temper should entail labor in the
way of claiming her regard i may say
sahib that a pindari seizes upon what he
wants and backs the claiming with his
sword but now it is all explained-the
wise gentleness that really was in the heart
of one so fierce as the chief-allah rest his
soul what say thou captain sahib

    bootea is wonderful barlow answered
fervidly  she is like a rajput princess

   kassim coughed stroked his black beard
adjusted the hilt of his tulwar then
coughed again

    inslialla but thou hast said some-
thing he turned to face barlow more
squarely  captain sahib the one who
suffered the wrath of allah to-day last night
sent a salaam that i would listen to a mat-
ter of value not wishing to have the hated
presence of the murderer in the room near
where was amir khan i went below to
where in a rock cell was this hunsa this
is the matter he spoke of no doubt hoping
that it would make me more merciful
therefore of a surety i think it is a lie it
is well known sahib that the rana of
udaipur had a beautiful daughter and
rajah jaipur and rajah marwar both laid
claim to her hand even sindhia wanted the
princess but being a mahratta-who are
nothing in the way of breeding such as are
the children of the sun-dust was thrown
upon his beard but the rajputs fly to the
sword over everything and a terrible war
ensued in which udaipur was about ruined
then one hyena garbed as the minister of
state persuaded the cowardly rana to sac-
rifice princess kumari to save udaipur

    all this is known sahib and that she
with the courage of a rajputni drained the
cup that contained the poison brewed from
poppy leaves and died with a smile on her
lips saying  do not cry mother to give
my life for my country is nothing that
is the known story sahib but what hunsa
related was that kumari did not die but
lives and has the name of bootea the
gulab

   the chief turned his eyes quizzically
caste



upon the englishman who muttered a half-
smothered cry of surprise

   it cant be-how could the princess be
with men such

   better there than sacrifice hunsa
learned of this thing through listening be-
neath the wall of a tent at night while one
ajeet singh spoke of it to the gulab it
was that the rana got a yogi a man skilled
in magical things either drugs or charms
and that kumari was given a potion that
caused her to lie dead for days and when
she was brought back to life of course she
had to be removed from where jaipur or
marwar might see or hear of this thing be-
cause they would fly to the swor again
kassim ceased speaking and his eyes
carried a look of interrogation as if he were
anxious for a sustaining of his half-faith in
the story

   its all entirely possible barlow de-
clared emphatically  its a common prac-
tice in india this deceit as to death where
a death is necessary it could all be easily
arranged the rana yielding to pressure to
save mewar and dreading the sin of being
guilty of the death of his daughter even
the gulab is like a princess of the sessodias
-like a rajputni of the highest caste

   indeed she is captain sahib the
quality of breeding never lies

   what discredits hunsas story bar-
low said thoughtfully  is that the gulab
was in the protection of ajeet singh who
was but a thakur at best-really a pro-
tector of decoits

  to save kumaris life she had been
given to the yogi and he would act not out
of affection for the girls standing as a prin-
ces but to prevent discovery blood-shed
and her life it is also known that these
ascetics-infidels children of the devil-by
charm or drugs or otherwise can cause
something like death for days-a trance
and the one who goes thus knows not who
he was when he comes back kassim
argued

   well barlow said  it is a matter un-
solvable and of no importance for the
gulab kumari or otherwise is a princess
such as men fight and die for

  there was a little silence barlow carry-
  ing on in his mind this the main interest

so far as he was concerned bootea as a
woman appealing to the senses or to the
subtlest mentality she was the sweetest
woman he had ever known

  there was a flicker of grim humor in
kassims dark eyes  captain sahib he
said  that evil-faced bagree had a curious
deep cunning i believe ill swear now by
the hilt of my tulwar that he made up the
whole story for the purpose of having audi-
ence with me and in his heart was a favor
desired for as i was leaving he asked that
i would have his turban given back to him
to wear on his going he pleaded for it of
course sahib a turban is an affair of caste
and i suppose he was feeling a disgrace in
going forth without it it appears the gulab
had taken it as an evidence that he had
been killed but when i sent a man for it
she told him that the cloth was possessed of
vermin and she had burned it

   but still chief though hunsa had an
animal cunning yet he could not make up
such a story-he had heard it somewhere
barlow felt his heart warm toward the
grizzled old warrior as he dropping the
nebulous matter of kumari said  and
to think captain sahib that but for the
gulab we would have slain you as the mur-
derer of amir khan as a patan even if i
had wished it i could not have fended the
tulwars from your body and you were a
brave man such as a pindari loves rather
than announce thyself as an englay-the
paper gone and thy mission failed-thou
wouldst have stood up to death like a
soldier

  he put his hand caressingly on barlows
knee adding  by the beard of the pro-
phet thou art a man but all this sahib
is to this end-we hold the gulab in rever-
ence as did amir khan and if it is per-
mitted i would have her put in thy hands
for her going those that were here in
the camp with her fled at the first alarm
and my riders discovered to-day too late
that they hid in an old mudwalled fort
about three miles from here whilst my pin-
daris scoured the country for them then
when my riders returned they escaped so
the gulab is alone i will send a guard of
fifty horsemen and they will ride with thee
till thou turnest their horses heads home-

ward and for the gulab there will be a
tonga such as a nawab might use drawn
by well-fed and well-shod horses that
too she may keep to the end of her jour-
ney and afterward returning but the
driver

   my salaams to you chief for your
goodness to-morrow if it pleases you i
will go with your promises to the british
 it is a command sahib-to-morrow
and may the peace of allah be upon thee
and thy house always

  he held out his hand and his large dark
eyes hovered lovingly over the face of the
englishman

chapter xxvi

like a beast of the jungle

captain barlow walked along to
the tent of bootea to tell her of the
arrangement that had been made for
their leaving the camp so that she might
be ready he could see in the girls eyes
the reflection of a dual mental struggle an
ineffable sweetness varied by a changing
cloud of something that was apprehension
or doubt

   the sajiib is a protector to bootea
she said  sometimes i wondered if such
men lived yet i suppose a woman always
has in her mind a vague conception that
such an one might be but always that
that is like a dream is broken-one
wakes

  prosaically taking the matter in hand
barlow said  you would wish to go back
to your people at chunda-is it not so
the girls eyes flashed to his face and
her brows wrinkled as if from pain  those
who have fled will be on their way to
chunda and they will tell of the slaying
of amir khan the dewan will be pleased
and they will be given honor and rich re-
ward they will be allowed to return to
karowlee

   yes barlow interposed  that hunsa
goes not back will simply be taken as an
affair of war that he was captured and
killed there will be nobody to relate that
you revealed the plot when you arrive
there you also will be showered with fa-

vors and ajeet singh will owe his life to
you they will set him at liberty

   and as to nana sahib bootea asked
and there was pathetic dread in her eyes

   what is it-you fear him

   yes sahib he will claim bootea a
mahratta never keeps faith there will be
a fresh covenant because he is like a beast
of the jungle

  barlow paced back and forth in the
small confine of the tent muttering  its
hell he pictured the gulab in the harem
of nana sahib-in a gaudy prison chained
to a serpent to interfere on her behalf
would be to sacrifice what came first-his
duty as an officer of state to what would
be called undoubtedly an infatuation
elizabeth would take it that way even
his superiors would call it at least inexpe-
dient bad form for a british officer to be
interested or mixed up with a native
woman no matter how noble the impulse
would be a shatterment of both official and
personal caste

   i wont allow that he declared vehe-
mently shifting into words his mental tra-
verse

  bootea had followed with her eyes his
struggle then she said the sahib has
heard of the women of the rajputs who
with smiles on their lips faced death who
when the time of the last danger came were
not afraid

    yes gulab but for you it is not that
way you have said that i am your pro-
tector i will be

  there was a smile on the girls lips as
she raised her eyes to barlows  it is not
permitted sahib the gods have the matter
in their lap for a little-yes perhaps it
is the time of the pilgrimage to the shrine
of omkar at mandhatta and bootea will
make the pilgrimage at the shrine is the
priest that told bootea of her reincarna-
tions as i related to the sahib

   a curious superstitious chill struck with
full force upon the heart of barlow kas-
sims story of kumari revivified itself with
startling remembrance was this the priest
that to save kumaris sacrifice had wafted
her by occult or drug method from one em-
bodied form into another from kumari to
bootea it was so confusing so overpow-
caste



cring in its clutch that he did not speak
of it

  the girl was adding  it is on the
sahibs way to poona there will be many
from karowlee at mandhatta and i can re-
turn with them

  this seemed reasonable to barlow she
would there be in the company of people
not at war and then erratically rebel-
liously he felt a heart hunger but he
cursed this feeling as being vicious-it was
he smothered it shoving it back into a
niche of his mind thinking he had locked
it up had turned a key in the door of the
closet to hide the skeleton

  he temporized saying  well well see
gulab perhaps at mandhatta i could wait
while you made an offering and a prayer to
omkar and then you could journey on to
chunda to himself he muttered in eng-
lish  by god ill not stand for that
slimy brute nana sahibs possession of the
girl-shes too good i know enough now
to denounce him

  in council with himself standing cap-
tain barlow firmly on his feet to face the
realities he realized the impossibility of be-
ing anything more to bootea than just a
sahib who had by fate been thrown into her
path temporarily and then feeling the
sway the compelling force of a fascinating
femininity he almost trembled for himself
weaker sahibs-gad he knew several
one a deputy commissioner a beautiful
little kashmiri girl had nursed him through
cholera when even his own servants had
fled the kashmiri who had the dainty
flowerlike sweetness of a japanese maid
and practically the same code had lived in
his protection before this after the nurs-
ing incident he had married her with bene-
fit of clergy and the result had been hell
a living suicide ostracism a good officer
he still remained deputy commissioner the
highest official of the district but the social
excellence was wiped out-he was a pariah
an outcast and the girl who now could
not remain just a native could not attain
to the dignity of a deputy commissioner
ntemsahib

  barlow knew several such of course
of drifters he knew also the white inland
beachcombers-men who had come out to

india to fill subordinate positions in the
telegraph or the railroad or mills and as
they sloughed off european caste and pos-
sessed of the eternal longing for woman
companionship had marked natives bar-
low shuddered at mentally rehearsed visions
of the degradation thus everything logical
was on that side of the ledger-all against
the gulab on the other side was the
fascination that the girl held for him

  yes at mandhatta they would both sac-
rifice to the gods curiously elizabeth
stood in the computation a cipher prob-
ably he would marry her but the escape-
ment from disaster from wreck would not
be because of any moral sustaining from
her any invisible thread of love binding
him to the daughter of the resident he
knew that until he parted from bootea at
mandhatta his soul would be torn by a
strife that was foolish contemptible that
should never have originated

chapter xxvii

infidels come to worship

and next day when barlow sitting his
l horse still riding as the afghan went
forth his going was somewhat like
the departure of a nawab chief kassim
and a dozen officers had clanked down the
marble stairs from the palace with him and
stood lined up at the gates raising their
deep voices in full-throated salaams and
blessings of allah upon his head

  the horsemen of the guard spears to
boot leg fierce-looking riders of the plain
were lined up four abreast the nakara in
the open court of the palace was thunder-
ing a farewell like a salute of light artillery

  the tonga with bootea had gone on be-
fore with a guard of two outriders

   all that day they traveled to the south
on their left against the eastern sky the
lofty peaks of the vindhya mountains hold-
ing the gold of the sun till they looked like
a continuous chain of gilded temples and
tapering pagodas for hours the road lay
over hard basaltic rocks and white lime-
stone then again it was a sea of white
sand they traversed with its blinding eye-
stinging glare

  at night when they camped barlow had
a fresh insight into the fine courtesy the
rough nobility that breeds into the bone of
men who live by the sword and ride where
they will the pindaris built their camp
fires to one side and two of them came to
where the sahib had spread his blankets
near the tonga and built a circle of smudge
fires from chips of camel dung to keep away
the flies then they went back to their fel-
lows and when barlow had pulled the
blanket over himself to sleep the clamor of
voices where the horsemen sat was hushed

  and bootea had been treated like a
princess at each village that they passed
some would ride in and rejoin the cavalcade
with fowl and eggs and fruit and sugar
cane and fresh vegetables and a mention
of payment would only draw a frown an
exclamation of  shookur these are but
gifts from allah there has been more
than payment that we have not cut off the
kotivals head not even demanded a peep
at the money chest we are looked upon as
men who confer favors

  it was the second day one of the horses
in the tonga showing lameness or perhaps
even weariness for the yoke of the tonga
across their backs did not ride with the ease
of a man the jamadar went into a village
and came forth with his men leading two
well-fed horses again when barlow spoke
of pay for them the jamadar answered
 we will leave these two with the unbe-
lievers and a message in the name of
allah that when we return if the horses
we leave are not treated like those of the
sultan there will be throats slit bismillah
but it is a fair way of treating these un-
believers they should be grateful

  the road ran through the large towns of
bhopal and sehore and at each place
jamadar jemla explained to all and sundry
of the officials that the patan meaning
barlow was a trusted officer with sindhia
and they were escorting a favorite for sind-
hias harem it was a plausible story and
avoided interference for while the pindaris
might be turned back if there was a force
handy to interfere with a lady of the kings
harem might bring a horde of cutthroat
mahrattas down on them with a snipping
off of official heads

  on the fourth day and now they were
on a good trunk road that ran to indore
and branching to the left that crossed the
nerbudda river at mandhatta they were
constantly passing pilgrims on their way to
the temple of omkar in the affrighted
eyes of the hindus barlow could read their
dread of the pindaris they would cringe
at the roadside and salaam as fearful were
they as if a wolf pack swept down the
highway

  the jamadar would laugh in his deep
throat and twist his black mustache with
forefinger and thumb and call the curse of
mahomet upon these worshipers of stone
images and foul gods he loved to ride
stirrup to stirrup with the englishman and
barlow found delight in the mans broad
conception of life the petty things seemed
to have no resting place in his mind unless
perhaps as a matter for ridicule the sweep
of a country with free rein and a sharp
sword and always the hazard of loot or
death was an engrossing subject even the
enemy who fought and bled and died were
men like themselves by allah men but
the merchants and the shopkeepers and
the moneylenders who cringed and paid
tribute when the pindaris drove at them in
a raid were pigs cowardly dogs who robbed
the poor and gave only to the accursed
brahmins and their foul gods he would
dwell lovingly upon the feats of courage of
the rajputs lamenting that such fine men
should be excluded from heaven dying as
they did such glorious deaths sword in
hand because of their mistaken infidelity
they were souls lost because of being led
away from a true god the one god-allah
-through false priests

    mark thou saiib jemla said once  i
do not hold that it is a merit in the sight of
allah to slay such except there is need but
when it is a jihad a question of the suprem-
acy of a true god allah or the sahibs god
-which no doubt is one and the same-as
against the evil gods of destruction and de-
pravity such as shiva and kali then it is a
merit to slay the children of evil mahomet
did much to put this matter right he de-
clared  he made good musselmen of
thousands who would otherwise have been
cast into jehatinum-hell-at times holding
caste

the sword over their heads as argument
therein mahomet was a true prophet a
saver of souls rather than a destroyer of
such

  by noon they were drawing toward
mandhatta and when they came to where
the road from indore to mandhatta joined
the one they were traveling there was an
increase in the stream of pilgrims and bar-
low could see a look of uneasiness in the
jamadars eyes

  there was a grove of wild mango trees
on the left running from the road down to
a stream that gurgled on its way from the
hills to the narbudda river and jemla
said  vve might camp here sahib for
there is both good water and firewood
they could see as they rested and ate
a party of hindus down by the stream
where there was a shrine to krishna that
nestled under a huge banyan that was like
the roof of a cave from which dropped to
earth to take root hundreds of slender
shoots like stalactites and whose roots
creeping from the earth like giant worms
crawled on to lave in the stream when
they had finished eating jemla said  that
is a temple of the preserver then he
laughed a full-throated sneer  allah
hafiz-god protect us-give me a fine-
edged tulwar-and mine own is not so dull
-methinks yon grinning affair of stone
would not preserve a dozen of these infidels
had there been cause for anger

   what do the pilgrims there for they
go it would seem to omkar barlow
queried

   there has been a death-perhaps it
was even a year ago and at the shrine of
krishna especially this one that is on a
water that is like a trickle of holy tears to
the sacred narbudda straddhas - prayers
for the dead-are said come sahib wte
will look upon this mummy the only savpr
of grace about the infidel thing being that
it perhaps brings to their hearts a restful-
ness having the faith that they have helped
the soul of the dead

barlow rose from where he sat and they
went down to where a party of a dozen were
engag in the service of an appeal to the
god for rest for the soul of a dead relative
the devotees did not resent the appearance

of the two who were garbed as moslems
the shrine was one of those of which there
are many in india that curiously enough
is sacred to both hindus and followers of
the prophet on a flat rock laved by the
stream was an imprint of a foot a legen-
dary footprint of krishna perhaps left
there as he crossed the stream to gambol
with the milkmaids in the meadow beyond
and it was venerated by the musselman be-
cause a disciple of mahomet had attained to
great sanctity by austerities up in the moun-
tain behind and had been buried there

  but barlow was watching with deep in-
terest the ceremonial form of the straddha
he saw the women place balls of rice milk
and leaves of the tulsi plant in earthen-
ware platters then sprinkle over this flow-
ers and kusa-grass they added threads
plucked from their garments to typify the
presenting of the white death-sheet to the
dead one a priest all the time mumbling
a prayer at the end of the simple ceremony
receiving a fee of five rupees

   as the two men turned back toward their
camp jemla chuckled  captain sahib
thou seest now the weapon of the brahmin
his loot of silver pieces was acquired with
little effort and no strife as to the rice
balls the first jackal that catches their wind
will have a filled stomach it is something
to be thought of in the way of regard for
a long abiding in heaven that such foolish
ones will not attain to it the setting up
of false gods carved images i was once
told by a priest of thy faith is sufficient
to exclude such it makes ones tulwar
clatter in its scabbard to see such profana-
tion in an approach to god

   then jemla spoke of the matter that had
engendered the troubled look barlow had
observed  the captain sahib has inti-
mated that the one -and he tipped his
head toward the girl- would proceed to
the temple of omkar to make offerings at
the shrine

    yes she goes there

   there will be a hundred thousand of
these infidels at mandhatta and when they
see fifty pindaris tulwar and spear and
matchlock there will be unrest perhaps
there will be altercation they will fear that
we ride in pillage


argosy-allstory weekly

   i was thinking of that barlow re-
plied  and it would be as well that you
turn your faces homeward

   we have received an order from our
chief that our lives are at the disposal of
the captain sahib and we will drive into
the heart of a mahratta force if needs be
but if it is the sahibs command we will ride
back from here jemla said

   yes there is no need of a guard for the
gulab now-just that the tonga carries her
as far as she wishes it barlow concurred

   indeed we are not needed those infi-
dels come to worship their heathen gods
not to combat men and mandhatta is but
a matter of twelve kos now jemla af-
firmed

  when captain barlow and bootea in the
tonga drew out from the encampment to
proceed on their way the pindaris rode on
in front and then at a command from
jemla wheeled their horses into a continu-
ous line facing the road stirrup to stirrup
the horsemen sitting erect with their tul-
ti-ars at salute as barlow passed a cry of
 salaam aleikum the protection of allah
be upon you rippled down the line then
the horsemen wheeled with their faces to
the north jemla swept a hand to his fore-
head and from his deep throat welled a fare-
well  salaam brother

chapter xxyiii

the deceit of a woman

the jamadars tribute from man to
man one encased in a dark skin and
one in a white was akin to the tribu-
lation that would not be driven from bar-
lows mind over the gulab that in their
case made the matter of a skin colorization
the ar sinister he rode in a brooding si-
lence and now the way was one of ascent
toward the pass through the yindhya
mountains a red gravelly undulating
formation had given place to basaltic rocks
they passed from groups of mhoua trees
and left behind a wide shallow stream its
bed dotted with pools fringed by great
koua trees and its banks lined by a thick
green cover of jamun and karotida thorny
babul thrust their spiked branches out over

the roadway white with tufts of cotton
torn by its thorns from bales loose pressed
on their way to market in buffalo carts-

  babul-the-thief the natives called this
 acacia higher up a torchwood tree
 gleamed as if sprayed with gold its limbs
 lean and bare of foliage holding at their
 extremities in wisplike fingers bright yel-
 low solitary blooms from a tendu tree
 a pair of droll little brown monkeys chat-
 tered and grimaced at the clattering cart

   a spotted owlet disturbed by the drivers
 encouraging  pop-pop dih-dik ho-ho-
 ho children of jungle swme brothers to
 buffalo addressed to the horses lagging in
 the climb fluttered away with his silly little
 cackle

   these incidents of travel were almost un-
 noticed by barlow all up the climb the
 retrospect was with him claiming his
 thoughts just that-all that was in evi-
 dence a pigment in the skin caste and yet
 reacting away back to gods mandate
 against the union of the white and black
 and verily a sin to be visited even unto
 the third and fourth generation for the
 bar sinister would be upon his children
 they would be half-castes with all of the
 opprobrium the name carried even the
 son of a king the offspring of such a union
 would be spoken of in mess and drawing-
 room as a half-caste the indelible sign
 would be upon him the blue tint to the
 white moons in his finger nails barlow
 shuddered why contemplate the matter
 at all it was impossible nana sahib had
 named the barrier when he had spoken of
 vania meaning color as caste a shirt of
 mail that protected from disaster

   sometimes as he dropped back past the
 tonga the face of bootea would appear be-
 neath the lifted curtain and though on the
 lips would be a sweet ravishing smile the
 eyes were pathetic full of heart hunger
 sometimes he vowed that he would put off
 the parting-dream on-carry her on to
 her people at chundalee then he would
 realize that this was cowardice a desire
 flooding his sense of nobility into a chasm
 of possible disaster-not fair to the girl
 the animal mastery of male over female the
 domination of sex beyond doubt wrapped
 in his arms not even the omnipotence of
caste



 the gods would take bootea away from him

if there were less innate nobility in his
avatar if he were like men that were called
redblooded men yet lacking the finer sensi-
bility this might be not a villainous rush
just drifting that was it the superlative
excellence of the gulab the very quality
that attracted was the shield the immacu-
late robe that clothed her and preserved her
like a vestal virgin from such violation
barlow could not word all these things
subconsciously they swayed him like the
magnetic needle always toward the pole of
right

  when they had topped the pass and
descended into the valley of the narbudda
clothed in arboreal beauty passed from a
forest of evergreen sal to giant teak trees
with huge umbrellalike leaves that formed
a canopy over the straight columnlike boles
of eighty feet and on amid topes of wild
mango and wild date down down to the
lower levels where the dhak jungles gave
way to feathery bamboo and plantain and
waving grass the sun like a great ball of
molten gold was splashing its yellow sheen
upon the waters of a stream that hurried
south to mother narbudda

  there was a small village of gonds or
korkus like a toy thing the houses woven
from split bamboo nestling against the bil-
lowing hills

   here we will rest and eat barlow said
to the gulab

   as the sahib wishes she answered
 and smiled at him like a child

  the huge medallion of gold had slid
 down in the west from the dome through
 which were shot great streamers of red and
 mauve and a peacock perched high in a
 sal tree far up on the mountainside sent
 forth his strident cry of  miaou miaou
 his evening salute to the god of warmth

    as the harsh call like an evening vuuez-
  zin died out the sweet song of a shanca in
  tones as pure as those of a nightingales
  broke the solemn hush of eventide

    barlow turned his face to where the
  songster was perched in the top branches of
  a wild fig and bootea said in a low voice
   sahib it is said that the shama is a soul
  come back to earth to sing of love that men
  may not grow harsh

  soon a silver moon peeped over the walls
of the vindhya hills and from the forests
above the night wind waking at the fleeing
of the sun whispered down through fea-
thered sal trees carrying the scent of balsam
and from a group of salei trees a sweet
ungent the perfume of the gum which is
burned at the shrines of hindu gods

  when they had eaten barlow said  i
wonder gulab if this is like kailas the
heaven those who have passed through
many transitions and become holy attain
to

   it is just heaven my lord she replied
fervently

   and to-morrow i will be plodding on
through the sands and dust and  be all
alone but you little girl you will be mak-
ing your peace with omlcar and dreaming
of the greater heaven

   yes it will be that way the sahib will
not have the tribulation of protecting
bootea and she will be in the protection of
omkar

  there was so much of pathetic resigna-
tion in the temper of the girls voice for it
was half sigh that barlow shivered as if
the chilling mist of the valley had crept up
to the foothills why had he not treated
her as an alien-kept all interest in abey-
ance his self recrimination was becom-
ing a disease an affliction

  he rose muttering  damn im like
the young wasters that swarm up to london
from oxford and get splashed with the
girls from the theaters-thats what im
like

  as he strode over to where his horse was
tethered munching his ration of bran
bootea followed him with her eyes won-
dering why he had broken into english
perhaps he was chanting an evening prayer

  when barlow came back he fell to wish-
  ing that they were at mandhatta so that
  he would start on the rest of his journey
  in the morning he dreaded the long eve-
  ning with the girl he could have sat there
  with elizabeth although their marriage
  hovered on the horizon and talked of trivial
  things-of sport of shooting or damned
  the executive sitting beneath the punkahs
  in offices with windows all closed far away
  in calcutta or could have traversed men-

tally leagues of sea and rehabilitated past the throat and a sonorous rumble irom the
scenes in london it would be like talking wide low wheels the driver drove the

 to a brother officer but with the gulab
 and the hush and perfume of the forest-
 clad hills and the gentle glamor of moon-
 light his senses would smother placid in-
 tellectuality he would be like a toper with
 a bottle at his elbow mocking weak resolve

   then the girl said something a shy halt-
 ing request that set his blood galloping

  sahib it is not far to mandhatta-four
 kos or perhaps it is five would it be un-
 permitted to suggest that we go there for
 the moon is beautiful and the road is good

   all right girl and remembering that
 he had spoken in english he added  it
 will be expedient for you will there find
 shelter

    yes sahib guru swami will be there
 and i am know-n of him and there are
 places where one may rest

    ill tell the driver to hitch up bar-
 low declared rising

   but she laid a detaining hand upon his
 arm  sahib the sweetest thing in all
 booteas life was the time she rode on the
 horse with him then too the moon that
 is the soul of purusha smiled upon her
 would it be permitted to bootea just one
 more happiness for to-morrow-to-mor-
 row-

   the girl turned away and seemed busy
 adjusting her gold-embroidered jacket

    so you shall gulab barlow declared
 and he too thought of the sweetness of
 that ride where she lay like a confiding
 child in his arms and also for him too
 was to-morrow-tomorrow and for him
 too just one more foolish useless happi-
 ness-just a sensuous burying of his face
 in flowers that on the morrow would have
 shriveled

    ill send the tonga on ahead he de-
 clared  and well just have that jolly old
 farewell ride together girl-id love it

   now she turned back to him and her
 face was placid soft content as though
 mona lisa had stepped out from the
 painted canvas and now embodied was
 there listening to the sigh of the night wind
 through the feathered sal forest

   with an ejaculation of  bap bap bap
 shabaz and queer gurgling clucking of

 tonga on into the moonlight barlow had
 saddled his horse and thrown his blanket
 loosely behind the saddle the air was
 chilling but his sheepskin coat would turn
 its cold breath the blanket was for
 bootea

   as he had done once before his feet in
 stirrups he reached down a hand and
 swung the girl up in front of him then
 he enveloped her in the blanket as she
 nestled against his chest arms about his
 waist her warm body was like a draft
 of wine and he muttered  my god i
 shouldnt have done this but he knew
 that he would have had that ride if devils
 had jeered at him from the jungle that
 lined the road

   as the horse swung along in leisure walk-
 ing stride the girl seemed to have gone to
 sleep pier cheek lay against barlows
 shoulder and he could feel the pulsating
 throb of her heart once a sigh came from
 her lips but it was like a breath of deep
 content barlow felt that he must talk to
 the girl his senses were rampant he was
 sitting like the lotus-eaters drinking in a
 deadly intoxication

   but it was bootea who broke the silence
 as though she too felt herself slipping
 she took from beneath her vestment a little
 bag of silk and taking from it a ruby she
 put it in barlows hand saying  here is
 the  lamp of akbar  it protects and gives
 power

    where did you get this magnificent
 ruby girl it is of great value barlow
 said in amazement

    do you remember sahib when bootea
 asked for the turban of ilunsa the time it
 was stripped from his head and the paper
 of message found hidden in it

    yes you said you would take it back
 to the bagrees to show them that hunsa
 was dead

   he could hear the gulab chuckle  that
 was but the deceit of a woman sahib the
 simple things a woman says to deceive a
 clever man i knew that hunsa had the
 ruby sewn in a comer of the turban and
 when i had taken the stone i burned the
 turban in the fire for it was very dirty
caste



   wtiere did hunsa get it

   when the b agrees killed the jewel mer-
chant that time the sahib saved bootea
he stole it from the other decoits hiding
it in his turban because the dewan wanted
it

   but i dont want the stone-i cant
take it barlow expostulated

   it is for a service sahib nana sahib
will assuredly cause ajeet to be put to
death if bootea does not return to his de-
sire but the sahib can buy his life with the
ruby of great price

   but if it were stolen would not nana
sahib demand it and then kill ajeet

   no it was not his ruby and to obtain
it he will set ajeet free

   ill do that gulab barlow agreed
and the girls hand pushed up from the
folds of the blanket to caress his cheek
and her face nestled against his shoulder

  the fingers thrilled him and though he
had made a solemn vow that he would ride
like an anchorite he bent his head and
kissed her with a claiming warmth that
caused her to cry out as if in misery

  presently a whimsical fancy swayed the
girl and she said  ayub alii

  barlow laughed and answered  bismil-
lahr

   so afghan riding thus it is not dis-
respect just that we be of different faith
hindu and musselman

  if it were thus wed not part at mand-
hatta and as to the faith thou wouldst
become a follower of the prophet

   yes bootea would if she could go
forever thus she would sacrifice entrance to
kailas but this is heaven and perhaps
omkar when i make the sacrifice-i mean
offering-will listen to booteas prayers
and-and-

   and what gulab barlow asked for
the girl turned her face against his breast
andher voice had smothered

  their thoughts were distracted by a din
  in front that shattered the solemn hush of
  the night there was a thunderous beat
  of tom-toms the shrill rasping screech of
  conch-shells and in intervals of subversion
  of instrumental clamor they could hear
  womens voices high-pitched singing the
  sohaiua-song of joy loud cries of  jae

jae omkar rose in a chorus from a hun-
dred swelling throats

  at a turning around a huge banyan tree
they saw the flickering flames of torches
and barlow knew that plodding in front
was a large body of pilgrims

  he quickened his horses pace drawing
bootea closer to hide her from curious eyes
and as he passed the hindus he knew from
their scowling faces and cries of  it is a
kaffir-a barbarian that they took him
for a musselman perhaps one of sindhias
arabs

  at the head of the procession carried on
a platform gayly decorated with gaudy
cloths borne on the shoulders of four men
was a figure of ganesha the obese four-
armed jovial son of shiva bobbing in the
rhythmic stride of his carriers seemed to
nod his elephant head at the horseman ap-
provingly wishing him luck as was the
wont of ganesha the procession drove in
upon barlows mind the thought that they
were nearing mandhatta he realized it
with a pang of reluctance it seemed but
a matter of just minutes since he had lifted
bootea to the saddle

  it had hurried the gulabs mind too
for at another turn where the road slid into
the valley bringing to their nostrils the
soft perfume of kush-kush grass and the
savor of jamun that grew luxuriantly on
the banks of the narbudda the gulab
asked u the sahib will marry the young
memsahib who is at the city of the
peshwa

  barlow was startled it was like a voice
crying out in the night that shattered a
blissful dream

   wtiy do you ask that gulab

   because it was said and the missie
 babas heart will be full of the sahib for
 he is like a god

    is the gulab jealous of the missie
 baba barlow asked mundanely almost
 out of confusion

     no sahib because-because one is not
  jealous of a princess because that is to
  question the wtays of the gods if i had
  been an englay and he loved me and the
  missie baba claimed him bootea would
  kill her

    this was said with the simple conviction


argosy-allstory weekly

 of a child uttering a weird threat but bar-
 low shivered

    and now gulab he persisted  if you
 thought i loved you would you kill the
 missie baba

    no sahib because it is booteas fault

 it cant be it is permiued to bootea to
 love the sahib but at the shrine omkar will
 take that sin and all the other sins away
 when she makes sacrifice-

   what sacrifice gulab

    such as we make to the gods sahib
 then something curious happened the
 girl broke she clung to barlow convul-
 sively sobs choked her

   he clasped her tight and laid his cheek
 against hers soothingly and said  gulab
 what is it dont go to the shrine of om-
 kar come with me to your people at
 chunda and if you do not want to remain
 with them i will have it arranged through
 the resident that the british will reward
 you with protection you have done the
 british raj a great service

   no sahib the girl drew herself
 erect so that her eyes gazed into barlows
 they were luminous with an intensity of
 resolve  let bootea speak what is in her
 heart and be not offended it is necessary
 there is at the end of the journey the
 place that is called jahannam-hell-for
 bootea the nana sahib waits like a tiger
 crouched by a pool at night for the coming
 of a stag to drink

      the resident will protect you against
   the mahratta barlow declared

      bootea could do that and in her small
   hand there gleamed in the moonlight the
   sheen of her dagger blade she thrust it
   back into her belt

      what then do you fear gulab he
   queried

      the sahib

      me gulab

      yes khudawand to see you and not
   be permitted to hear your voice nor feel
   your hand upon my face would be worse
   than sacrifice bootea would rather die
   slip off into death with the goodness the
   sweetness of to-night upon her soul there
   where the sahib would be booteas heart
   would be full of evil the evil of craving for
   him

   no this is the end and bootea will
make offerings of thanks-marigolds and a
coconut to omkar and sprinkle attar upon
his shrine in thankfulness for the joy of the
sahibs presence it is said and the girl
nestled down against barlows breast again
as though she had gone to sleep in content

  but he groaned inwardly there was
something of dread in his heart her resig-
nation was so deep-suggesting an utter
giving up a helplessness she had named
sacrifice the word rang ominously in his
mind beating at his fears and yet what
she had said was philosophy wise a some-
thing that had been worded perhaps differ-
ently for a million years the brave accept-
ance of fates decree-something that al-
ways triumphed over the weak longings of
humans

now they could see the wide silver
ribbon of mother narbudda lying
serene and placid in the moonlight
in the center of the rivers wide flow the
gloomy rock embrasures of mandhatta is-
land where it towered upward in cliffs
and coned hills the summit showed the
flickering lights of many temples and like
the sing of a storm through giant trees there
floated on the night wind the sound of
many voices and the beating of drums and
the imperious call of horns and conch-shells

   they came upon the tonga waiting by
the roadside and barlow thrusting back
the covering from the girls face said

 now gulab i will lift you down we
must find a place in the village beyond for
you to rest to-night i too will remain
there and in the morning we will make
our salaams

   then he drew her face to his and kissed
her

   he slipped from the saddle and lifted the
girl down carrying her in his arms to the
tonga

   as they neared the village that was sit-
uated on the flat land that swept back from
the xarbudda in a wide plain and nestled
against the river bank thev were swept into

                           	a
caste



a crowd such as would be encountered on
a trip to the derby the road was thronged
with people and the village itself from
which a bridge reached to the island of
mandhatta was a town in holiday attire
for to the hindus the mela of omkar was a
union of festivity and devotion

  both sides of the main street were lined
with booths for the sale of everything-
calicoes from kalicut where these prints
first got their name hammered benares
ware gold-threaded cotton puggrees from
mawar tulwars and khandas from bhundi
in some of the little shops bamboo struc-
tures that thrust an underlip out into the
street there was mhowa liquor and lulabis
and kabobs of goat meat open spaces held
tiny circuses-abnormal animals and per-
forming goats and a moonbear on a ring
and strap

  the street was full of gossiping men and
women dodging here and there it was an
outing where the ryot-farmer-had es-
caped from his crotched stick of wood that
was a plow the village tradesman had
left his shop and the servant his service to
feel the joyousness of a holiday mendi-
cants were in abundance prowling in their
ugliness like spirits in a nightmare some
naked absolute others with but a loin
cloth their lean shriveled bodies smeared
with ashes-sometimes the ashes of the
dead-and cow dung carrying on their
arms and foreheads the red and white hori-
zontal bars of shiva who was omkar at
mandhatta

  these mendicants carried in their hands
iron tongs with loose clattering ring or a
yaks tail or the three-ribbed hom of a
black buck

  some of the yogis perhaps goswamies
  that had come from the country where ek-
  linga was the tutelary deity had their hair
  braided and woven around their foreheads
  holding in its fold lotus seeds and beneath
  the tiara of hair a crescent of white on their
  foreheads a flowing yellow robe half hid
  their ash-smeared limbs a tall sannyasi
  -the most ascetic of sects-his lean yel-
  low-robed form supported by a long staff at
  the end of which swung a yellow bag
  strode solemnly along with eyes fixed on a
  book the bhagavad gita muttering

     	a

aunt to the light of the earth the divine
light that illumines our souls aunt

  to barlow it was like a grotesque panto-
mime with no directing hand ndutch girls
tripped along laughing and chatting brace-
lets jingling and tiny bells at their ankles
tingling musically it depressed him it
was such a terrible juxtaposition of frivolity
and the gloomed shadow of idol worship
that lay just the bridges span of the sullen
narbudda the gloomy broken scarps of
the long since deserted forts that cut with
jagged lines the moonlit sky and beyond
them again the many temples with their
scowling brahmin priests and the shrine
wherein the god of destruction omkar sat
athirst for sacrifice he shivered as though
the white mist that veiled the river crept
into his marrow

  the gulab seemed at home amongst
these gathered ones two or three times
she had bade the driver stop his creeping
pace and looking out from beneath the cur-
tain had questioned a man or woman at
last as they were stopped by a wall of
people watching the antics of some strolling
players upon a platform bootea spoke to
a stout woman who was pressed against
the opening into the cart by the mob

   lttcker khan bhaina bcrwree the gu-
lab said in a low voice and the womans
eyes took on a startled look for it was a
decoit password and the bowrees were a
clan of decoits akin to the bagrees from
the woman bootea learned where she could
find a good resting place with the family of
a shopkeeper there was no doubt about
it the bowree woman assured her for the
tonga would impress him and he was one
who profited from the loot of the decoits

   the gulab was given a place to sleep in
the shopkeepers house that extended back
from his little shop the driver was or-
dered to return in the morning to the pin-
dari camp barlow was for keeping the
tonga hoping that perhaps bootea would
change her mind and go on to chunda
but the girl was firm in her determination
to end it all at mandhatta

   before barlow left her to seek some
  camping place in hut or serai and food for
  himself and horse the girl said if the
  sahib will delay his going to-morrow for a


argosy-allstory weekly

little bootea will proceed early to the
shrine to see the swami-then she will re-
turn here for she would want to see his face
once more before the ending

    ill wait gulab he acquiesced  ill
 be here at the tenth hour he felt even
 then an unaccountable chill of their part-
 ing for many being about he could not
 take her in his arms to kiss her but their
 eyes spoke and the girls were luminous
 and sweet with a look of hunger of pathetic
 longing of sublime trust

  as barlow turned away leading his
horse he muttered over and over  gad
its incomprehensible that a saliib should
feel this over a-yes a native woman its
damnable

   he reviled himself declaring that it was
 harder on the gulab than on him-and
 he was actually suffering it would be bet-
 ter if he swung to the saddle and fled from
 the misery that prolongation would make
 it more intense and the girls brave resig-
 nation in giving him up was wonderful-
 was so like her

   then at the sight of mahratta soivars
 who it being sindhias territory were a
 guard to watch the pilgrim throng flashed
 him back to a sense of duty his own mis-
 sion but it had not suffered because of
 bootea-it had benefited through her but
 for her the written message from the british
 would have been lost-stolen by hunsa
 and would have landed in nana sahibs
 hands and he would have been slain as
 the patan killer of amir khan

  but the gulab was right from that
time forward should she listen to him and
go on to poona god alone knew where it
would lead to-misery it would be utter
ruin morally officially in a caste way
even in time passionate enthusiasm en-
gendered by her lovableness dulled would
bring utter debasement degradation of
spirit of man fiber it was the wisdom
of god that entailed upon the union of the
white and dark skinned the bar sinister

   until he slept wrapped in his blankets
 on the sand beside his tethered horse bar-
 low was tortured by this mental inquisition
 even in his troubled sleep there was a
 nightmare that waked him panting and ex-
 hausted and the remembrance was vivid-

bootea lay beneath the mighty paws of a
tiger and he was beating hopelessly at the
snarling brute with a clubbed rifle

caste

in the morning captain barlow under-
went a sartorial metamorphosis he at-
tained to the sanctity of a hindu pil-
grim by the purchase of a tight-angled pair
of white trousers to replace the voluminous
baggy ones of a patan and a rajput tur-
ban blue shot with gold he shoved the
patan turban with its conical fex in his
saddle bags and wound the many yards of
blue material in a rakish crisscross about
his shapely head running a fold or two be-
neath his chin the patan sheepskin coat
was left with his horse

   when bootea came at ten to where bar-
low-who was now jaswant singh-paced
up and down with the swagger of a rajput
in front of the buntuas shop she stood for
a little her eyes searching the crowd for
her sahib when he laughed and called
softly  gulab her eyes almost wept for
joy for not seeing him at once a dread that
he had gone had chilled her

    you see how easy it is in a good cause
to change ones caste he said

    with you sahib yes because you can
also change your skin

   there it was again the indestructible
barrier the pigmented badge it drove the
laugh from barlows lips

   why has the afghan musselman be-
come a hindu bootea asked

    i have no wish to anger these people
who are on a holy pilgrimage by going into
their temples as a moslem

    you are going to the shrine of omkar
the gulab asked aghast

are you-again barlow parried

    yes sahib soon

 i am going with you barlow declared

   bootea expostulated with almost fierce
eagerness with a fervor that increased the
uneasiness in barlows mind he had a
premonition of evil dread hung on his soul
-perhaps born of the dream of a tiger de-
vouring the girl
caste



   the sahib still has the akbar lamp-
the ruby the girl queried presently

   i have it safe he answered tapping
his breast

   if the sahib is not going to the shrine
bootea would desire that we go out beyond
the village to a mango tope where there are
none to observe for she would like to make
the final salaams in his arms-then noth-
ing would matter

   perhaps we had better go anyway
barlow said eagerly  though i am going
over to the shrine with you for now being
a hindu i can pass as your brother and
there would not be opportunity

  the girl turned this over in her mind
then said  no we will not go to the
grove for bootea can say farewell to the
sahib in the cloister where swami saras-
vati has a cell for vigils

  then asking barlow to wait she went
into the house and soon returned clothed
in spotless white muslin he noticed that
she had taken off all her ornaments her
jewelry the bangle of gold that was a
twisting snake with a ruby head she
pressed upon barlow saying  when the
sahib is married to the englay will he give
her this from me as a safeguard against
evil and that it may cause her to worship
the sahib as a god even as bootea does
the simplicity the genuine nobleness of
this tribute of renunciation hazed barlows
eyes with a mist-almost tears she was
a strange combine of dramatic power and
gentle sweetness

     now come sahib she said  if you
insist it will not bring misery to bootea
but to you

   barlow strode along beside the girl
  steeped in ominous misgivings perhaps his
  presence at the temple would avert what-
  ever it was that like an evil jinni seemed
  to poison the air

    there was a moving throng of pilgrims
  that poured along in a joyous turbulent
  stream toward the bridge no shadow of
  the dread god omkar gloomed their
  spirits they chatted and laughed of those
  who would make devotions the men were
  stripped to the waist their limbs draped in
  spotless white and the women on their
  way to have their sins forgiven were taking

final license-the purdah of the veil was al-
most forgotten for this was permitted in
the presence of the god even their beau-
tifully formed bodies and limbs the skin
fresh anointed gleaming like copper in the
sunlight showed entrancingly voluptu-
ously with a new-born liberty

  once half way of the bridge a mans
voice rang out commandingly calling back-
ward admonishing some one to hurry cry-
ing  it is the kurban

  barlow started the kurban meant a
human sacrifice he looked at bootea-
he could have sworn her head had drooped
and that she shivered the girl must have
sensed his thoughts for she turned her eyes
up to his but they held nothing of fear
beyond the bridge they passed across a
lower level jungle clad with delicate bam-
boos and dhak and sweet-scented shrubs
clusters of gorgeous oleanders the way
was thronged with white-clothed figures
that seemed like wraiths ghosts drifting
back to the cavern of the destroyer

  then they commenced the ascent fol-
lowing the bed of a stream that had cut a
chasm through back trap rock leaving
jagged cliffs and the persistent jungle
ever encroaching on space had outposts of
champac and wild mango their giant roots
like the arms of an octopus holding achor-
age in clefts of the rock and from the
limbs above floated down the scolding
voices of lungoor the black-faced gray-
whiskered monkeys who rebuked the intru-
sion of the earth-dwellers below where the
path lay over rocks it was worn smooth and
slippery by naked feet the feet of pilgrims
for a thousand years on the right the
mouth of a deep cave had been walled up
by masonry within so the legend ran
the high priest of mandhatta centuries be-
fore had imprisoned the goddess kali to
stop a pestilence making vow to offer to
bhairava her son a yearly human sacrifice
higher up approaching the plateau where
were the ruins of a thousand gorgeous
shrines both sides of the pathway were
lined by mendicants who sat cross-legged
in front of them a little mat for the receipt
of alms-cowries pice silver-the mendi-
cants muttering incessantly  jae jae om-
kar-victory to omkar

   in front of the temple within which sat
the god was a conical black stone daubed
with red the linga the generative function
of siva and before it the symbol of repro-
duction women made offering of coconuts
sweets and garlands of flowers-generally
marigolds-and prayed for the bestowal of
a son even their postures carried away
as they were by desire showing a complete
abandon to the sex idea a brahmin priest
sat cross-legged upon a stone platform re-
peating in a sing-song cadence prayers and
from somewhere beyond a deep-toned bell
boomed out an admonishing call

  holy water from the sacred narbudda
was poured into the two jugs each pilgrim
carried and sealed by the brahmins who
received without thanks stoically as a
matter of right a tribute of silver

   towering eighty feet above the temple
spire was a cliff and from a ledge near its
top a white flag fluttered idly in the lazy
wind it was the death leap the ledge from
which the one of the human sacrifice to
omkar leaped to crash in death beside the
linga

  almost without words barlow and the
girl had toiled up the ascent scarcely no-
ticed by the throng and now bootea said
 sahib remain here i go to speak to the
high priest

   barlow saw her speak into the open por-
tal of one of the cloister chambers that sur-
rounded the temple then disappear within
after a time she came forth and approach-
ing him said  the priest would speak
with thee sahib for because of many things
i have told him who thou art though men-
tioning not the nature of your mission for
that is not permitted

   barlows foreboding of evil was now a
certainty as he strode forward

   the priest rose at the captains entrance
he was a fine specimen of the true brah-
min the intellectual cult that through suc-
cessive generations of mental sway and
homage from the millions of untutored ones
had become conscious of its power tall
spare of form with wide high forehead and
full expressive eyes almost olive skin bar-
low felt that the swami was quite unlike
the begging yogis and mendicants a man
who was by the close alliance of his intel-

lect to the essence of created things a sann-
yasi larger in his conceptions than the
yogis who misconstrued the vedas and the
law of manu as imposing an association of
filth-smeared ashes and uncombed un-
cleansed hair-as a symbol of piety and
abnegation of spirit a visible assertion that
the body had passed from regard-that it
with its sensualities and ungodly cravings
had become subservient to the spirit the
soul

   swami sarasvati was austere barlow
felt that he dwelt on a plane where the
trivialities of fife were but pestilential in-
sects to be endured stoically in a physical
way with the mind freed from their irrita-
tion grasping grander things life was a
wheel that revolved with the certainty of
celestial bodies

   it was so curious and yet so unfailing
 that bootea with her hyper-intuition
 should have found selected this spiritual
 tutor from the horde of gurus byragies
 and yogis that were connecting links be-
 tween the tremendous pantheon of gro-
 tesque gods and the common people here
 she had come to an intellectual though no
 doubt an ascetic one possessed of fierce
 fervor in his ministry there would be no
 swaying of that will force developed to the
 keen flexible unflawed temper of a damas-
 cus blade

   nowr the priest was saying in the as-
 pure-hindustani of the high-bred brah-
 min  the sahib confers honor upon sri
 swami sarasvati by this visit for the
 woman has related that he is of high caste
 among the englay and has been trusted
 by the raj with a mission that he comes
 in the garb of my people is consideration
 for it avoids outrage to their feelings  am
 glad to know that the englay are so con-
 siderate

    i came swami because of regard for
 bootea for she is like a princess

   the priest shot a quick searching look
 into the eyes of the speaker and then he
 asked  and what service would the sahib
 ask

   the question caught captain barlow un-
 aware he had not formulated anything-
 it had all been nebulous this dread he
 hesitated fearing to voice that which per-
caste



haps did not exist in the minds of either
the priest or bootea

  the girl perceived the hesitancy and
spoke rapidly in a low voice to the priest

   captain sahib the swami began  i
see that thy heart is inclined to the woman
and it is to be admired for she is as thou
thinkest like a flower of the forest but
also captain sahib thy heart is the heart
of a soldier of a brave man the light of
valor is in thine eyes in thy face and i
would ask thee to be brave and instead of
being cast in sorrow because of what i am
going to tell thee thou must realize that it
is for the good of the woman whose face is
in thy heart to-day she insures to her
soul a place in kalias-the heaven of siva-
the abiding place of brahm the creator of
all that is

  barlow felt himself reel at this sudden
confirmation of his fears-the blow the
cry  kurban  that he had heard on the
bridge was a reality-a human sacrifice

   god he cried in a voice of anguish

 it cant be young and beautiful and
good to die-its wrong i forbid such a
cruel wanton sacrifice of a sweet life

  the swami taking a step toward the
door swept his long thin arm with a ges-
ture that embraced the thousands beyond

   captain sahib he said solemnly  if
thou wert to raise thy voice in anger against
this holy soul-redeeming observance thou
wouldst be torn to pieces not even i could
stop them if insult were offered to omkar
and besides the englay raj would call
thee accursed for breeding hate in the
hearts of the hindus through the sacrilege
of an insult to the high priest of the temple
of omkar this is the territory of the
mahrattas and the english have no au-
thority here

    barlow knew that he was helpless even
  if there were jurisdiction of the british
  one against thousands of religious fanatics
  would avail nothing

    the priest saw die torture in the mans
  face and continued  the woman has
  told me much her heart is so with thee
  that it is already dead thou canst not
  take her to thy people for the living hell
  is even worse than the hell beyond if thou
  lovest the woman glory in her release from

pain of spirit from the degradation of be-
ing outcast-that she judges wisely and
there is not upon her soul the sin of taking
her own life for if she went with thee
proud and high-born as she is it would
come to that sahib-thou knowest it
there are things that cannot be said by me
concerning the woman vows having been
taken in the sanctity of a temple

   a figment of the rumor barlow had heard
that bootea was princess kumari floated
through his mind but that did not mat-
ter bootea as bootea was the sweetest
woman he had ever known it must be
that she had filled his heart with love

   again bootea spoke in a low voice to the
priest and he said  sahib i go forth for
a little for there are matters to arrange i
see yonder the sixteen brahmins who ac-
cording to our rites assemble when one is
to pass at the shrine of omkar to katlas

   his large luminous eyes rested with tol-
erant placidity upon the face of this man
whom he must consider according to his
tenets as a creature antagonistic to the true
gods and said in his soft modulated
voice  thou art young sahib and full of
the life force which is essential to the things
of the earth-thou art like the blossom of
the mhowa tree that comes forth upon bare
limbs before the maturity of its foliage it
is then as thou art joyous in the freshness
of awaking life but life means eternity
the huge cycle that has been since indras
birth life here is but a step a transition
from condition to condition and the
woman by one act of sacrifice attains to
the blissful peace that many livings of re-
incarnated body would not achieve it is
written in the law of brahm that if one sac-
rifices his life this phase of it to omkar
who is siva even though he had slain a
brahmin he shall be forgiven and sit in
heaven with the gandharms-angels but
it is also written that whosoever turns back
in terror each step that he takes shall
be equivalent to the guilt of killing a
brahmin

   the priests voice had risen in sonorous
cadence until it was compelling

  bootea trembled like a wind-wavered
leaf

   to barlow it was horrible and mad in-


argosy-allstory weekly

fatuation of a man prostrate before false
gods idols a rabid materialism that one
to fall crushed and bleeding from the dizzy
height of the ledge of sacrifice upon a red-
daubed stone representation of the repul-
sive emblem could thus wipe out the
deadly sin of a murder was even spiritu-
ally impossible

   the priest his soul submerged by the
sophistry of his faith passed from the
gloomed cloister to the open sunlight

   and barlow consicous of his helplessness
unless bootea would now yield to his en-
treaties and foreswear the horrible sacrifice
turned to the girl his face drawn and hag-
gard and his voice when he spoke vibrated
tremulously from the pressure of his de-
spair he held out his arms and bootea
threw herself against his breast and sobbed

   come back to chunda with me gu-
lab barlow pleaded

    no sahib she said breathlessly  it
cannot be

    but i love you bootea he whispered
 and bootea loves the sahib and her
eyes as she lifted her face were wonderful
 there she continued  the sahib could
not make the nika-marriage-with boo-
tea both our souls would be lost but it
is not forbidden-even if it were and was a
sin all sins will be forgiven bootea before
the sun sets-and if the sahib permits it
bootea will wed herself now to the one she
loves hold me in your arms-tight lest
i die before it is time

  and barlow pressed the girl to him
fiercely crushing her almost she raised her
lips to his and they both drank the long
deep draft of love

   then the gulab drew from his arms and
her face was radiant a soft exultation il-
lumined her eyes

    that is all sahib  she said bootea
passes now goes out to kailas in a happy
dream go sahib and do not remain be-
low for this is so beautiful you must
ride forth in content

   she took him by the arm and gently led
him to the door

   and from without he could hear a chorus
of a thousand voices its burden being
 the kurban

   barlow turned one foot in the sunshine

and one in the cloisters gloom and kissed
bootea and she could feel his hot tears
upon her cheek

  once more he pleaded  renounce this
dreadful sacrifice

   but the girl smiled up into his face say-
ing  i die happily husband perhaps
indra will permit bootea to come back in
spirit to the sahib

   the high priest strode to the entrance of
the cloister his eyes holding the abstrac-
tion of one moving in another world he
seemed oblivious of the englishmans pres-
ence as he said

    come forth ye who seek kailas through
omkar

   as barlow staggered almost blind over
the stony path from the cloister he saw
the group of sixteen brahmins their fore-
heads and arms carrying the white bars of
siva

   then bootea was led by the priest down
to the cold merciless stone-linga-where
she at a word from the priest knelt in
obeisance a barbaric outburst of music
from horn and drum clamoring a salute

   when bootea arose to her feet the priest
tendered her some mhowa spirit in a coco-
nut shell but the girl disdaining its stimu-
lation poured it in a libation upon the
linga

   from the amphitheater of the enclosing
hills thirty thousand voices rose in one
thundering chorus of jae jae omkar
and  to omkar the kurban

  many pressed forward mad fanaticism
in their eyes and held out at arms length
toward the girl bracelets and ornaments to
be touched by her fingers as an act of
beneficence

  but swami sarasvati waved them back
and turning to bootea tendered her with
bowed head the pan supari-betel nut in
a leaf-as an admonition that the ceremony
had ceased and there was nothing left but
the sacrifice

   as the girl with firm step turned to the
path that led up through shrub and jungle
growth to the ledge where fluttered the
white flag a tumult of approbation went
up from the multitude at her brave devo-
tion then a solemn hush enwrapped the
bowl of the hills and the eyes of the thou-
caste



sands were fixed upon the jutting shelf of
rock

  a dirgelike cadence a mighty gasp of
 a a kuda sounded as a slim figure
white robed like a wraith appeared on the
ledge and from her hand whirled down to
the rocks below a coconut cast in sacrifice
next a hand mirror its glass shimmering
dickers of gold from the sunlight

  for five seconds the white-clothed figure
disappeared in the shrouding bushes men

the

held their breath and women gasped and
clutched at their throats as if they choked

  then they saw her again arms high held
as though she reached for god and as
the white-draped slender form came hur-
tling through the air women swooned and
men closed their eyes and shuddered

  an englishman clothed as a hindu lay
prone on his face on the hillside sobbing
the dry leaves drinking in his tears cursing
himself for a sin that was not his

jazz

 a crowded noisy over-heated room

    where screaming cymbals crash and loud drums boom
 above the broken rhythm and the moan
 of muted violin and saxophone-

 i close my eyes and seem to see
 a feast of savage revelry
 under a blood-red tropic moon

 chanting a minor voodoo croon
 of evil origin and sound

 the jungle people circle round
 to the tom-toms slow hypnotic beat

 thin anklets tinkling shrill and sweet

 lewd leering gods carved on the trees
 sanction these forest mysteries
 in the champaks fragrant rustling gloom
 where shadows cast a purpling bloom

 the jasmin buds are crushed to dust
 xeath trampling feet of love and lust-

 flesh cries to flesh with fierce desire

 and sex-lure surges ever higher

 the maddening vicious throb of drums

 a crowded room where men and women dance-

 music insidious in its dissonance-

 and dominating all this frenzied din

 the wanton notes of horns and violin

mazie v carat hers
by samuel g camp

with the understanding that i am
in no way connected with the
management why i suppose you
have by this time no doubt seen a certain
show entitled  a perfect fool and which
for some time has been standing em up
in front of one of our leading playhouses
well its a nice show but what i was
going to say is this just the minute i
hear where the producers are going to send
out some road companies leave it to me
to apply for the name part in the number
one company because its a copper-riveted
cinch that im there with positively all the
qualifications

  and if they turn me down-though it
dont seem possible-im gonna tip off a
friend of mine eddie bigelow who admits
that he is a well-known vaudeville artist
and believe me eddie gets the job do
you get me

  well what i mean when my good friend
tasker wylie the well-known impresario
of boxers gave me his word that kid cav-

eney-a boxer whose contract t wylie
turns over to me outa pure friendship and
at a terrific sacrifice at a time when i am
down and seven-eighths out on account
of an overindulgence in the music publishin
business-when tasker wylie gives me his
word that this kid caveney is nothing less
than a second georges carpentier why ive
got the notion that he must have meant
something more than just that the kid
was about georgess size classing as a light-
heavy and that the way the kid handles
himself in the ring is a dead ringer for the
great frenchman and that like georges
mr caveney packs a right which sure is
the old tnt and no mistake and matters of
that sort

  not that i want you to get me as saying
that t wylie was keeping something back
from me no nothing like that but be
that as it may you probably remember
how when the fascinating georges comes
over here for the purpose of taking that
two-hundred-thousand-dollar slap from our
vamp till ready



jack why the dames simply fall for him
in mass formation as you might say and
likewise you no doubt recollect how the sob-
sisterhood wipes the dust off the good old
greek-god stuff and gives it another run
for the money and how-but no doubt you
get the idea georges certainly goaled em
and thats a historical fact

  well it is likewise a matter of history
that the great french athlete had nothing
on kid caveney in the respects to which
i have just alluded for as regards the ef-
feminate sex what a knockout he was
why for a fact kid caveney had these
beautiful cake eaters featured in the collar
ads lookin like the leadin male characters
in the comic strips and so you can figure
for yourself exactly how many chances the
slightly fairer sex had with the kid the
answer is not a chance

  and another thing as you no doubt
know m carpentier is popularly supposed
to have a type of mind so to say which
aint to be mentioned in the same breath
with the sort of so-called brain which is
usually to be found growin wild among the
average run of box-ftghters

  thats to say if we are to believe the
advertisements why georges is quite an
accomplished actor and reads only the best
of literature-maybe writes a mean poem
for all i know-and allowin for the differ-
ence in climate between here and paris
why his manners are simply flawless and
all this and that

  well believe it or not in these respects
also the kid yields not an inch to the beau-
tiful and likewise accomplished georges
why its a fact that the kid has got these
terrible roughnecks with which he is forced
to associate in the glove-pushin trade look-
ing like nothing so much as so many sub-
normal morons and no one is freer to admit
it than mr caveney himself and as an
actor-well take it from the kid all he
needs is a chance and right away hell have
doug wallie and the rest of em looking
like a bunch of rank outsiders so what
with one thing and another you can believe
me when i say that piloting mr caveney
was one sweet job

  and just to prove it and at the same
  time make a tall story short im going to

give you a chance to listen in on a little
bag-punching bee which took place between
me and eddie bigelow some eighteen
months after kid caveney came under my
skillful management you probably re-
member i already mentioned eddie and
as i said then there is no doubt in the
world that eddie is one of our leading
vaudevillains because he himself admits it
anyway one day as im leaving the build-
ing in which my well-appointed general
headquarters are located why there parked
just outside the door and watchin the world
go by is eddie bigelow

  im busier than a flea at a dog show
but not having seen him in quite some time
of course i have to stop and find out how
things are going with eddie and right
away eddie remarks that im looking kind
of worried	

   worried i says  where do you get
that idea wthy as a matter of fact i got
no more to worry about than a baseball
umpire in a pop-bottle factory

  what seems to be the trouble asks
eddie  kid caveney hitting the high
spots or something

   you guessed it i says  or words
to that effect listen if youve ever seen
him you dont need to be told that kid
caveney has got whos this adonis lookin
like a stage tramp

  i always said says eddie that if
that bird ever went into the pictures hed
be a bigger riot than anything that was ever
pulled in dublin

    by an odd coincidence i says  thats
practically what the kid has always said
himself and it seems now theres still a
third person that has the same identical
idea and whats more she aint hesitated
to tell him so and seein shes in the
business herself why this time it means
something ill say it does

   who do you mean he asks

   muriel morton i says

   you dont mean muriel morton he
 says

   you heard me i says

   but muriel morton he says  why
 shes a regular headliner 

   dont i know it i comes back  but
  what of that believe me in this kind of


argosy-allstory weekly

 matter mr caveney is no respecter of per-
 sons so to say high low jack and the
 game ill say they simply cant resist him
 anyway this muriel morton is simply wild
 over the kid and the kid is simply wild
 over her and-well if you count me in
 why that makes three of us thats simply
 wild and thats a fact

    but whats the idea asks eddie  is
 the kid gonna quit the boxing game

     in a nutshell i tells him  the idea is
 this under the influence of the celebrated
 muriel who has no use for this low-browed
 glove-pushin business the kid has already
 notified me that as soon as he has smacked
 one round harris for the customary row
 of shanties and which comes to pass three
 weeks from to-night why hes immediately
 gonna start knocking em dead in the
 movies

    no says eddie

     yes i says

    thats tough says eddie thereby
 provin that he has a wonderful grasp of the
 situation

    youll know how tough it is i says
  when i tell you that if the kid beats one
 round harris which is a dead and buried
 cinch gene richards the world-famous
 fight promoter has given me his word to
 three weeks later put on the kid with no
 less than battling rothstein who as you
 well know is the light-heavy titleholder
 and between you and me eddie battling
 rothstein has got the same chance with
 the kid that i got with dempsey-no more
 no less in other words if it wasnt for one
 thing and another why in six weeks time
 id be managin a champion-and you know
 what that means

    h-m says eddie  so thats the sce-
 nario

     take it or leave it i says

    well at that for a short spell eddie gives
 an imitation of a real deep thinker doing
 his stuff then finally he says

    listen you gonna be busy this af-
 ternoon because if you aint i want to
 have you come round and get my act at the
 regal

    well i says  of course im busy
 but-

    because eddie goes on  it may

 mean quite a lot to you to see this act of
 mine and then again maybe it wont mean
 nothing thats for you to say-after you

 have seen the act

    what kind of an act is it i ask him

    wait and see he says  except i
 might say were billed as bigelow and
 morgan and listen as you go in dont
 take a program i want you to see this act
 without knowing nothing about it before-
 hand because if you know whats coming
 off why it might spoil things

    have it your own way i says  but
 say at precisely what time this afternoon
 is the plot due to thicken when do you
 go on

    be sure and be there by three he
 tells me  i want you to see the way we
 open up because in a way thats the
 punch of the piece

    o k i says  and if i dont show
 up why youll know its because i died of
 curiosity in the meantime

   so after agreeing to meet eddie at his
 hotel about four oclock i tear myself away
 and-well shortly before three as adver-
 tised i arrive at the regal which i dont
 know whether youd call it a second or third
 rate vaudeville house but it certainly aint
 a first-class one

   on the way in i skillfully sidestep the
 program which is aimed at me and after
 i get to my seat why im simply on pins
 and needles to see whats coming off be-
 cause i pride myself on the fact that i got
 at the least average intelligence and so of
 course i knew that eddies wanting me to
 lamp this act of his was in some way con-
 nected up with my troubles with kid cav-
 eney though what the connection was or
 how there could be one anyway why that
 was something which was beyond me

   well i had something to be thankful for
 anyway because i got there just in time
 to see the bitter end of a trained animal
 act and if theres one thing more than
 another which i personally like to see be-
 lieve me its the end of a perfect trained ani-
 mal act then when the curtain goes up
 for the next turn for the worse why it
 seems theres nobody on the stage which
 represents in a terrible feeble manner what
 the society novels calls a drawing-room
vamp till ready



anyway thats the idea i seem to get
though i dont know why because while
drawing-rooms is something which i per-
sonally only read about still ill say them
stage settings come as near representing one
as ten cents worth of ice comes to repre-
sentin the arctic regions

  however the agony is soon over right
away there bursts into view a vision which
-well believe it or not if gloria pickford
mary swanson and betty stewart had been
among those present why theyd have
immediately rose up and left the place in a
rage of jealousy because one and all not
to say bar none this dame has got the
rest of her esteemed contemporaries in the
unmanly sex faded like a bathin suit in
september and you can take my word for
that why-but no doubt you get the
idea she certainly is one blue-ribbon look-
er and no mistake

  and believe me im strongly tempted to
borrow a program just to see whether this
eye-soothin damsel is the morgan of bige-
low and morgan you remember eddie had
said his partners name was morgan but
i play the game fair after the worlds
champion looker has warbled one of the
popular songs of the day in a kind of deep
chesty contralto i believe its called-and
while im no musical critic nevertheless
im prepared to state that long before this
cover illustrators dream breaks into the
metropolitan shell be doing her stuff in
the angel choir-well then eddie enters
smiling and caparisoned in a dress suit
which looks like the kind which is mostly
wore by trapeze artists and of course that
settles it

   likewise i begin to get a kind of hazy
  idea as to what eddie is driving at but
  ill say i didnt know the half of it be-
  cause the big smash of the piece for me
  was when at the close of the act-which
  certainly went big-the pulse-quickenin
  miss morgan while taking her third cur-
  tain call removes a wonderful blond wig
  thereby bringing to view what would have
  been a bumper crop of raven locks only
  for a prison haircut and proceeds to thank
  the customers in one of them bass voices
  thats usually associated with train an-
  nouncers heavy tragedians and the like

  yes that was the punch of the piece for
me-when i discover that ive tumbled for
a female impersonator but what a female
impersonator

  and i said as much to eddie when a bit
later we got together at the hotel morgan
wasnt with him

   wheres morgan i asks him

   oh hes scpewheres eddie says

 we dont run around much together we
got different friends

   well i says  id like to meet him
because while no doubt as the feller says
genius is an infinite capacity for taking
pains instead of as you might say faking
janes nevertheless ill say hes a genius
and id like to tell him so

   so you fell for him grins eddie

   worse than that i admits  i fell
for her

   i thought you would he says  so
would the kid

   eh i says

   so would kid caveney says eddie

 once the kid sees morgan like you seen
him this afternoon without knowin its a
female impersonator working believe me
hell forget muriel like a flash because
while muriel morton is a wonderful screen
actress why you gotta admit that as a
looker she aint so much and it wouldnt
make no difference if she was because
this morgan is good-what you said it
and listen-that aint all of it hes good
anywhere

   what i mean is he dont need any foot-
lights between him and the audience to
keep up the deception so to say hes
good anywhere not one person in a thou-
sand would guess hes anything but what he
looks like-and thats like a dame thats
got sol bloomfields little pets lookin like
so many fiji islanders am i right you
know it

     and so all we gotta do he says  is
  be a little careful about where and when
  the kid meets morgan-maybe the kid
  might notice something in broad daylight
  though what with the way all the janes
  are makin up nowadays i doubt if he would
  even then-and it  be the easiest thing
  in the world for morgan to keep stringin
  the kid along until after the kid has won


argosy-allstory weekly

 the championship then evell have to wise
 him some way

    as we used to say in the popular song-
 hit business i observes  vamp till
 ready

    and once the kid gets muriel out of
his system says eddie  why no doubt
hell give up this idea of canning the fight
game	

    no doubt i agrees  for the time
being anyway but listen of course you
are a friend of mine eddie but somehow
i got a notion that you aint proposing
this just outa pure friendship hey and
so-v

    to tell you he says  you saw our
act just now and you know its the goods
morgans costumes are o k but he oughta
have more of em and believe me you got no
idea of the cost of them elaborate gowns
which he has to wear its somethin fierce
but our scenery is rotten and that dress
suit i wear-say it looks like one of them
trick circus soup-and-fish rigs which falls
apart when you pull a string hey maybe
you noticed it anyway all thats keeping
us off the big time and from there into a
production is lack of money and thats
straight so well put this thing through
for you for say a thousand berries and-
 wait a minute i cuts in  who dye
think youre talkin to-the king of the
bootleggers

    and expenses he says

    lemme give you a tip eddie i says
  the next time youre pinched plead in-
 sanity theyll never be able to hold you
  listen he says  for the virginia
 kid thing you and the kid get an even
 twelve thousand bucks for your end the
 soldier simms scrap pays you ten thou-
 sand the two punch costigan brawl pays
 you another twelve grand for the kayo
 curtis fight-

    all right all right i gives in  as a
 student of history eddie ill say you got
 woodrow wilson in the fourth grade and
 not going so good at that well call it a
 deal

   and i guess you dont need any better
proof than that of the way i was up against
it-my falling for this harebrained scheme
of eddies but if i wasnt actually goin

 down for the third time why i certainly had
 all the sensations and so it was just another
 case of the celebrated drownin man clutch-
 in for the well-known straw ill say so
 and we put it across

   however if i was to go into all the de-
 tails from here on why there would be no
 end to it and so the best i can do is dwell
 briefly on the high spots as you might say

  one look at the breath-takin miss
gladys delano-which is the alias eddie
suggests for morgan to use while doing his
stuff with the kid-one look at gladys and
mr caveney immediately goes overboard
and muriel and the movies are no more
things of the past than hoopskirts high
bicycles and brass rails because for one
thing the beautiful-but false-gladys has
been carefully coached to make it plain to
the kid where one of the main reasons why
shes crazy over him is on account of what
he actually is-one of the very best athletes
then performing before the public and not
as any would-be movie hero or the like

   well the time for the one round harris
 quarrel came and went-leavin mr harris
 more or less comfortably located in a strict-
 ly modern and up-to-date hospital and doin
 as well as could be expected it took a
 couple of competent surgeons two weeks to
 undo what the kid did in a few short min-
 utes once more provin the theory that it
 is much easier to tear down than to build
 up but as mr harris would say what of
 that hey

   now as you remember our chance of
getting a shot at the champion battling
rothstein depended on the outcome of this
imbroglio with one round harris so im-
mediately after the kid sends mr harris
to the ash heap why promoter gene rich-
ards is as good as his word and the cus-
tomary arrangements are promptly made
for the kid to meet battling rothstein
three weeks later-for the title

   so at a hasty glance you might think
everything was jake-or o k as you
might say but not so

   anyway its an undeniable fact that dur-
 in that three weeks i smash all existin rec-
 ords for indoor and outdoor worryin it
 aint the battling rothstein fuss which has
 me as nervous as a com in a popper be-
vamp till ready



 cause i am positive of that just as sure as
 one of the main causes of baldness is sittin
 in the front row the kid will beat the bat-
 tler in a manner as hollow as a summer hotel
 in january

  and likewise it aint the sweet bill of ex-
penses which this cheap actor morgan is
running up either and which he claims is
necessary to support the distracting but
phony gladys delano in the style to which
she is accustomed-such as livin at a swell
hotel and at least one new gown the week
and all this and that though of course
maybe its necessary in order to keep up the
deception as eddie and morgan both
claims

  no it aint either of these things thats
got me walking the floor nights startin at
every little sound like id been shot and
exhibiting other equally alarmin symptoms
of being about an even one inch this side of
nervous prostration

  but ill tell you what it is the fact of
the matter is the kids got a temper like
a nervous wildcat and when he finds out
the way we have handed him the work-
well what then hey because believe me
that boy swings a mean bare knuckle yes
right there ladies and gentlemen is the
arsenic in the pie crust

  however just about then i wasnt the
only one whose favorite hobby as you
might say was viewin the situation with
alarm we simply got to have a showdown
with the kid right away after the rothstein
battle and as the fatal time draws near
friend eddie who had introduced the be-
witching but synthetic gladys to the kid
and had also played quite a prominent part
in the subsequent proceedings-well ed-
die likewise begins to feel himself slipping

  so me and eddie get together a number
of times and discuss the matter with much
care and considerable earnestness and we
finally come to the conclusion that theres
only one way out of it eddie and mor-
gans engagement at the regal had come
to an end only a day or so after we started
to frame the kid and they hadnt tried
to get another booking because mr cav-
eney might accidentally drift into the place
where morgan was doing his stuff-in which
case the beans would have been spilled

right there and then otherwise if mor-
gan had been working somewhere why we
could have steered the kid to the place and
let him find out for himself-with what
results it is difficult to say and then again
it aint so difficult

  but the way things were why it looks
like the only way is for all of us to get
together in my place of business the morn-
ing after the rothstein battle and come
clean to the kid by no means omittin
to tell mr caveney how it was all for his
own good and so forth and if the kid
burns up and starts to wreck the joint in-
cludin his three earnest well-wishers mr
bigelow mr morgan and myself-well
theres always a cop handy on the corner
and no doubt hell be able to quell the dis-
turbance before it amounts to anything
more than a couple of hospital cases or the
like

  at least let us hope so

  so for want of a better that was the
plan we agreed on-though believe me had
it been possible i would have much pre-
ferred to handle the matter by radio from
moscow

  well durin my long and useful career
i can remember passin quite a number of
highly enjoyable evenings at mrs madi-
sons square garden but the eve on which
kid caveney met battling rothstein for
the light-heavy championship of this mans
world aint one of em far from it as
you know i had rated battling rothstein
as nothing more or less than a push-over
for mr georges carpentier nd alias kid
caveney and the battler would have been
all of that if-well if the kid had not
sprung a complete surprise on the hundreds
of ring worms which had foregathered to
view the obsequies not to mention myself
you see always before this the kid had
gone after his man right from the openin
chime and had usually succeeded in knock-
ing the opposing candidate slantwise before
the victim found out whether hed been
struck by a resemblance or a cyclone as
you might say

with a few scattering exceptions none
of the kids scraps had gone more than five
stanzas at the most-with the kid right in
there tryin all the time but this time its


argosy-allstory weekly

 different despite the kid having seeming-
 ly every inducement to do his prettiest-
 among others the fact that miss gladys de-
 lano lookin like an extra-super-special-
 feature produced at staggerin expense by
 the combined beauty parlors of new york
 london and paris is viewing the proceed-
 ings from a ringside chair-in spite of
 everything apparently mr caveney takes
 as much interest in the affair as i take in
 the annual rainfall at jacksons corners
 new york

   which is to say in spite of everything i
 and the disgusted mob of fight addicts can
 think of to call him-and believe me were
 good at it-the kid does anything but fight
 and nothing but dog it

   for a fact theres more fight in two
 fingers of grape juice than there is in mr
 caveneys entire frame anyway he does
 nothing but cover up and as an uninnocent
 bystander i seem to grasp the idea that mr
 caveney is chiefly concerned over the fact
 that there is a bare possibility that one of
 the two million boxin gloves which battling
 rothstein is hurlin at him may come in
 contact with his classical features

   and as a result the battler has soon
 piled up more points than rockefeller has
 pesos and the kids only chance of win-
 ning is by a knockout-which if you ask
 me i got the same chance of knocking out
 a living as a toe dancer fine business-
 what

   but then something happens you un-
 derstand the kid is a master hand at cov-
 ering up-ill say he proved it-and though
 to the tyro it might have looked as if the
 battler had hit the kid with everything but
 the marquis of queensberrys title why
 as a matter of fact the kid is only slightly
 the worse for wear

   and whether the kid takes exception to
 some remark which rothstein addresses to
 him or whether one of the battlers blows
 stings the kid out of his trance-well i
 dont know-but anyway all of a sudden
 that temper of the kids which i believe i
 have mentioned goes glimmering and-
 man

   was there a difference there was such
 a difference that two short minutes later the
 official referee is holdin up the kid s hand

 in the pose made famous by the statue of
 liberty and-well to all intents and pur-
 poses thats that

   but though alls ended well somehow
 i cant seem to work up a whole lot of en-
 thusiasm over the kids victory you know
 what i mean

   well were still in the dressing room and
 the new champ has hardly got into his street
 clothes when he asks me for his end of the
 money

   i think its kind of funny because hed
 never done it before but id collected be-
 fore the show and so i gave it to him then
 i take a long breath and tell him i want
 to see him at the office next morning at
 ten oclock

    whats doing he asks

    that depends i says  maybe quite
 a lot and then again maybe not so much
 im no clairvoyant but i certainly do wish
 i was anyway i want you to be there

   he said he would

   well next morning it lacks about twenty
 minutes of the zero hour and im sittin
 there alone in the office waiting for the rest
 of the cast to show up and maybe because
 of not eating much breakfast on account
 of somehow having no appetite why i am
 experiencing a kinda gone feeling in the
 mid-section when in crashes eddie bige-
 low

   sweet adeline i says now what
 has happened

   because eddie is all shot-thats plain to
 be seen

    listen he says gettin right to the
 point  theres something i gotta tell
 you about a year ago im doin a single
 in a three-a-dav joint down south well
 theres a girl on the same bill that looks
 like mary pickford plus a million dollars
 but her stuff is no good and she aint get-
 ting by shes billed as gladys delano
 the contralto queen but her voice sounds
 more like a sort of cross between a barber-
 shop barytone and a bunch of static

   gladys delano i gasps and right
 then i get the idea that maybe its some-
 thing more than a mere coincidence that
 so far ive never yet seen this so-called
 morgan except in costume as vou might
 say why-
vamp till ready



   wait says eddie  the best thing
gladys does is a couple of imitations of
famous actors in one of which she uses
a deep bass voice thats what gives me
the idea-see as a contralto queen shes
a two-spot-but what a looker and billed
as a female impersonator-get me why
shed be a riot and believe me thats
something thats never been done before-
female impersonating an impersonator of
females as you might say and makin em
like it the triple-cross-what

   well i sell her the idea and we work
up an act and of course theres a lot of
difficulties of one kind and another but
weve discounted beforehand most of the
stuff were liable to go up against and we
get -away with it easier than you think

   that is to say even the profession aint
wise to the stuff were pullin then gladys
agrees to work this game on kid caveney
on account we certainly need the money
and in a month more we would of been on
broadway if-

  he hesitates and glances toward the door
like as if he is calculating the distance

   if what i demands

   if gladys hadnt -gone crazy over the
kid and married him he comes out with it

  im outa my chair like a shot

   sweet sister  i yells  you mean-
 she leaves me a note last night he
says  fixes it sos i wont get it till this
morning gladys and the kid got married
a week ago then last night soon as you
paid off the kid-anyway thats what i
figure theyre waiting for-they leave for
california where they are gonna go into
the pictures she says she aint wised the
kid to the game we was playing on him-
or thought we was-and she hopes therell
be no hard feelings

   no hard feelings  i begins in a voice
which you could have probably heard with-
out the least difficulty in montenegro

   be good pleads eddie  listen i
admit you got a grievance on account of
losin your meal card well you got noth-
ing on me i not only lose my meal ticket
because you might as well say thats what
gladys was but i lose a bride we was
engaged to be married next month

  well at that i kinda cool off because
it sure does look like eddies had a pretty
rough deal slipped to him

   all right eddie i says finally  all
that is all that but try to collect that
thousand berries just try it

the gossip heart

 a- day i read your letter till the light
        tiptoed away and suddenly came night

and all the stars of heaven leaned down to see

 peering across my shoulder like the eyes
 of women envious till i grown wise

 kissed it beloved and hid it jealously

 beneath my heart i hid it and most sure
 i deemed its resting-place and all secure

 but lo my traitor heart the whole night through
 thrills with the knowledge i would fain secrete

 oh faithless gossip heart whose every beat
 is but a whisper of a word of you

theodosia garrison
technically dave thorne was
the best conductor on the rock hill
division of the t l  g person-
ally he was the very worst he knew more
about the safe and prompt movement of
trains than any other man on the division
and he exercised tibat knowledge with a
precision and directness that was next to
uncanny the outstanding admonition in
the book of rules to the effect that  when
in doubt take the safe course and run no
risks  was not written for dave he
seemed never in doubt there is no pro-
phesying the heights he might have
attained had he not in the parlance de-
veloped the  swellhead

  in addition to his skill a guardian angel
seemed to watch over dave thorne in
his eight years of service on the rock hill
division he had never had a wreck
through no fault of their own the best of

  trainmen have wrecks a car or an engine
  may leave the rails split a switch or meet
  with a thousand other unavoidable mis-
  haps but none of these had ever hap-
  pened to dave luck of course but it
  looked good on the records

    in daves time trainmen were poorly
  organized especially on the t l  g
  promotion was based more upon record
  and favoritism than upon length of service
  dave had risen rapidly from brakeman to
  conductor and on up through the classified
  freight runs to the blue uniform of an extra
  passenger man for a man not quite
  thirty he was indeed getting on

     but as already stated success had gone
  to his head no member of his crew could
  get along with him they were con-
  stantly deserting his runs for more con-
  genial working mates and when per-
  chance some man endured his arrogance
  	 a
from the ground up



and remained that man sooner or later
was  turned in  and removed on some
charge or other

  this practice had dave stopped to
consider it was more detrimental to him-
self than to the others he was forever
getting new men- students as they
were termed who were just breaking into
the game and knew little or nothing about
the work expected of them this threw
most of the work and all the responsibility
upon dave and did not tend to improve
his efficiency

  after  turning in  a particularly able
braketnan for no more reprehensible reason
than that the man had  talked back  to
him a clean looking young fellow of
twenty-one or two intelligent industrious
and anxious to learn who had just com-
pleted his student trips was assigned to
daves run upon their first meeting when
the young man had brought his engine
from the roundhouse and was coupling it
to the train dave looked him over critic-
ally sneered and observed

   another student eh wonder how
this road expects to run trains with dubs
like you its enough to make a man throw
up his job and go where they use some
judgment 

   we all have to learn you know  the
young fellow returned smilingly  and i
suppose this road has to teach its share of
us 

  dave whipped out his time book and
pencil whats your name i suppose
 have to turn in your time for the trip
anyhow 

   my name is ewing  replied the other
still smiling- edwin l ewing 
u all right-ewing  dave snapped as
he inscribed the name and jammed the
book back into his pocket  if you stay on
this run youll hit the ball try to re-
member that 

   yes sir  smiled ewing  thats
what im here for 

  the run was one of the best and fastest
  on the division pulling only live stock and
  other perishable freight there was little
  for a brakeman to do except ride for
  two trips everything went on smoothly
  enough then dave got an order to pick
   a

up three cars of live stock at a station a
few miles farther on he handed the or-
der bearing the car numbers and initials to
ewing with the remark

   pick up these cars at hadley while
im getting the bills from the agent and 
he added with a sneer  see if you can do
it right 

    yes sir said ewing pleasantly

  the cars were on the stock track at the
loading chute a passing extra had kicked
two empties in on top of them the proper
method would have been to bring all five
cars out at once leave the loads on the
main and kick the empties back on to
the stock track again instead ewing
first brought out the empties went back
for the loads coupled them ahead of the
empties and set the two back on the stock
track thus making two extra switches

  dave thorne came running up just as
the engine was coming out on the main
from the last operation

    of all the brainless useless muddle-
headed dubs  he shouted throwing his
arms and swearing with the fluency of long
practice  didnt you know enough to
bring all those cars out at once leave the
loads on the main and simply kick the
empties back 

   i know it now  returned the brake-
man  but i didnt think of it until i was
almost through you should have told
me

    thats the trouble with you and about
nine-tenths of the other fatheads on this
road  thome raged  you never think
you expect some one else to do it for you
if a thought should ever get in that dome
of yours it would split wide open now
couple up that train-if you know enough
-and lets go

  instead of darting confusedly about his
work as most students were wont to do
under daves tirades ewing straightened
placed his hands on his hips and grinned
calmly up at him

   say he asked li do you think such
talk tends to promote efficiency among
your men or that it will influence officials
to give you a better job

  dave moved forward threateningly

   no more of your lip young fellow


argosy-allstory weekly

 you couple up that train as i told you
 this is your last trip with me 

    you can bet it is  said ewing still
 calm  just leave that to me youll get
 another man next trip all right ill see
 to that

    when i was called for this run  he
 went on without giving thorne a chance
 to break in  i was told to steer clear of
 you that you had the swellhead so bad
 nobody could get along with you and id
 last only a trip or two anyhow youre
 a good railroad man though they all give
 you credit for that and i was glad to get
 on with you so i could watch you work
 and learn how you did things im in this
 game to learn it from the ground up but
 im of the opinion now that i can learn
 more from some one with less knowledge
 of railroading and a little more principle
 dave thorne sneered  from the
 ground up well youd better try the
 pick and shovel route thats the only
 way youll ever be of any use to a railroad
 im telling you for the last time to couple
 up that train 

    thanks for the encouragement re-
 turned ewing  but watch me im in
 this game to stay and im going right on
 up even though you do think im a fat-
 head and incapable of thought some day
 i may be superintendent of this division
 he added lighdy  and if i am ill make
 you hit the ball ill fire you so thor-
 oughly you cant even get a job with a
 pick and shovel and now kind sir ill
 couple up your train 

   ordinarily when a brakeman had made
 a trip or two with him and then either left
 of his own volition or was removed at
 daves request thorne promptly forgot
 him but somehow young ewing stuck in
 his mind for one thing he was far above
 the average in education appearance and
 willingness for another he had expressed
 himself in an easy fearless manner with-
 out the least trace of excitement or anger
 dave had to admit reluctantly to be sure
 that the young fellow had the makings of
 a railroad man

   thereafter for a time dave saw ewing
 at various points along the road some-
 times on extras sometimes on locals now

 and then on the manifest opposite his own
 then he saw the boy no more and after
 a time he forgot him

   meanwhile however things were hap-
 pening at the division office officials it
 seems had grown weary of his eternal fric-
 tion with the men besides there had
 been complaints from patrons of the road
 for incivilities suffered on thornes occa-
 sional trips as extra passenger conductor
 he was summoned to the superintendents
 office and the resulting conference was
 anything but pleasant

    weve about reached our limit with
 you dave the official told him pointedly
  in view of your record we have tried to
 ignore your constant scrapping with the
 men hoping that you might see the utter
 senselessness of such an attitude and aban-
 don it but when patrons of the road be-
 gin to complain we have no choice in the
 matter when the public pays a corpora-
 tion for service it wants service and not
 abuse from an employee as a matter of
 discipline dave we have decided to retire
 you from passenger work for at least one
 year 

   that ended the interview but instead
 of showing dave the error of his way-the
 handwriting on the wall as it were-it
 served only to create a resentment toward
 the official which heretofore had not
 existed the thing was plain enough to
 thorne once he had thought it over the
 superintendent was afraid of him jealous
 of his ability fearful lest those higher in
 authority should discover and reward him
 the superintendent was afraid of his job

   davevs promotion to extra passenger
 conductor ahead of men much older in the
 service had been a triumph a red-letter
 day in his career to don his new uni-
 form and strut up and down the aisle of
 a well-filled coach snapping out orders to
 his flagman berating a passenger for the
 unwitting violation of some company rule
 inaugurated for the safety of patrons had
 fed his ego and given to him in his own
 opinion an air of vast authority

   therefore it was a crushing blow to his
 ambition and pride when he was ordered
 to pack his trim blue uniform in moth
 balls and lay it aside for a year he grew
from the ground up



 more abusive more domineering than be-
 fore within a year there was another
 summons to the division office a more
 vigorous reprimand and still further re-
 duction in status this time he was as-
 signed to the local freight run

   and still he did not take heed the
 next act of official disapproval came in the
 form of a letter it was brief and to the
 point

      effective at once and until further notice
    conductor david thorne had been assigned
    to the chain gang

   the chain gang as all railroad men
 know is made up of crews which have no
 regular runs their work consists chiefly
 of moving the long heavy trains of coal
 lumber and other slow freight they are
 called out in the order of their arrival at
 a division point sometimes at noon some-
 times at midnight any hour they are
 needed

    dave had been through all this years
   before he detested the slow heavy trains
   long irregular hours and uncertain earn-
   ings yet there was nothing to do but
   accept or resign and he had no thought
   of the latter in spite of the superin-
   tendents persecution the mans deter-
   mination to keep him down he felt that
   higher officials would somehow discover his
   unusual qualifications and resent the treat-
   ment to which he was being subjected

    so inwardly seething dave thorne
   took his place in the chain gang and
   there with no credit to himself he got
   along better in the chain gang train
   and engine crews seldom make two con-
   secutive round trips together and as the
   brakemen assigned to dave were chiefly
   of the  boomer  type constantly coming
   and going it was not necessary to request
   a mans removal or for a man to seek re-
   moval of his own accord that was
   brought about automatically

      with the absence of reported friction
    the superintendent must have concluded
    uiat dave had at last fallen into his proper
    niche and that for all concerned it was
    best that he remain there at any rate
    there were no more summonses to the office
    no further correspondence of a disciplinary
    nature

  tn time dave thorne began to silver at
  the temples his shoulders took on a weary
  and discouraged droop the long heavy
  drags of slow freight with their attendant
  irregularity of rest and meals were be-
  ginning to tell upon him outwardly the
  change was only physical he was the same
  old arrogant domineering dave but in-
  wardly although he would not have ad-
  mitted it even to himself another and
  still greater change was in process slowly
  but surely his spirit was being broken

   day by day at various points along
 the road he was met or passed by men
 who years before had been his brakemen
 they were now far above him some
 were conductors of the fast manifest runs
 two or three were old heads in the pas-
 senger service now and then as they
 flashed by a man would raise a hand in
 perfunctory greeting but as a rule they
 ignored him they had worked together
 he and these men but they had never
 been friends for that matter there wasnt
 a man on the division who was or ever
 had been his friend

    came a day when dave thorne alone
    in his ancient caboose creaking jerkily in
    the wake of a half-mile string of loaded
    gondolas grew introspective and took
    stock of himself it came to him sud-
    denly that he was a failure it was ten
    years now since he had been reduced to
    the chain gang here he was forty
    years old and exactly where he had been
    sixteen years ago when first promoted to
    conductor something was wrong and
    that something was dave thorne

      for the first time in his life he saw
    himself as he really was and with the
    discovery came a stab of self-condemna-
    tion and a tremor of fear he didnt
    blame the men for disliking him nor the
    superintendent for his acts of discipline
    now that he understood himself he won-
    dered that he hadnt been discharged out-
    right he might even be discharged yet 
    there were other matters that had
    worried him of late too he had a wife
    and two children a boy fifteen and a girl
    twelve and whatever his attitude toward
    others he loved his family with a passion
    that would have surprised his acquain-


argosy-allstory weekly

tances could they have known the depth
of it he had planned great things for
that son and daughter-high school col-
lege a profession for the boy music art
any accomplishment the girl might desire
through his own arbitrary nature that
dream had been wrecked there was only
one course left to him now strive with
all his might to hold his present job and
give them what he could with its scant re-
muneration

  from that moment dave thorne was
a changed man soon brakemen were
asking to be assigned to his car engineers
and firemen spoke of him as  a prince of
a fellow  on the road other conductors
waved a comradely greeting or called out
some word of friendly banter as they met
or passed him and although dave felt
that he had delayed this transformation
too long that it could now avail him
nothing so far as promotion was concerned
he was nevertheless genuinely happy

   then came news that the t l  g had
 been absorbed by one of the big trunk
 lines antiquated rolling stock was to be
 replaced with new and improved equip-
 ment the road was to have heavier steel
 and additional ballast working conditions
 were to be improved and the wage scale
 adjusted to a union basis also the trunk
 line was to install a superintendent familiar
 with its policies and capable of transform-
 ing the old slipshod t l  g into a regu-
 lar railroad

   at first dave thorne felt a sense of
elation perhaps after all there was a
chance for him with the official docket
swept clean with no longer any personal
dislike or antagonism on the part of his
immediate superiors he might be rewarded
with the status to which his long service
entitled him

   two months later a bulletin appeared
in the yard office announcing the appoint-
ment of a new superintendent in sub-
stance it read

     mr edwin l ewing has been appointed
   superintendent of the rock hill division to
   succeed mr f j morehouse transferred

   although vaguely familiar the name at
 first meant nothing to dave it seemed to

 him that some time in the past he had
 known an edwin l ewing still lots of
 men had identical names and there was
 nothing strange in ones knowing two of
 them

   the incident was passing from his
 thoughts when suddenly a yard clerk
 pointed out through the open door re-
 marking

    look theres the bird now theres
 the new super used to be a brakeman
 here 

   daves gaze followed the pointing finger
 the yardmaster accompanied by a trim
 neatly-dressed businesslike young man
 had just emerged from the roundhouse and
 was crossing the tracks toward the division
 office and with that look daves heart
 skipped a beat there was no mistaking
 the strangers identity edwin l ewing
 the new superintendent was none other
 than the brakeman he had abused for
 bungling the little job of switching more
 than twelve years ago

    im in the game to learn it from the
 ground up  he recalled the exact words
 ewing had spoken that day and his own
 sneering reply  from the ground up
 well youd better try the pick and shovel
 route thats the only way youll ever lie
 of any use to a railroad  -and again
 ewings concluding retort some day i
 may be superintendent of this division and
 if i am ill make you hit the ball ill lire
 you so thoroughly you cant even get a
 job with a pick and shovel

   well somehow that young mans idle
 boast had come true was it fate coinci-
 dence or the mans own vengeful con-
 triving that had brought him back here
 with authority to fulfill a threat made
 years ago malice dave  knew often
 lends stimulus to a mans ambition for
 position and power could this be true
 in ewings case he didnt try to formu-
 late an answer

   for several days he contrived to keep
 out of ewings sight he dreaded the
 meeting not only because he feared the
 result but because now that he had come
 to realize the folly of the old days he was
 heartily ashamed of the way he had
 abused the well-meaning brakeman
from the ground up



   have you met the new super yet a
fellow conductor asked him one day
 regular fellow  tell the world noth-
ing high and mighty about ewing hes
just one of the boys and by the way
dave he was speaking of you a few days
ago said he used to brake for you
dave thorne gulped and looked away
 yes  he said he did make a trip or
two with me i believe

  so the man still remembered and some
of these days- he tried not to think of it

  when a full month had gone by and he
had neither met nor received any com-
munication from the new official dave be-
gan to breathe easier then upon register-
ing in late one night he found a letter in
the yard office mail box for him it was
from ewing and it requested him to re-
port at the division office the following
morning at nine and that night when
dave thome reached home he buried his
head in his wifes lap and broke down
utterly

   im through here janie  he said and
choked in spite of himself  the new
superintendent was one of my brakemen
twelve years ago i abused him like a
dog the way i did everybody in those
days he boasted hed fire me if he
ever had a chance well hes got his
chance and-and hes summoned me to
his office to-morrow morning i know what
that means janie im through what
will become of us-you and the children
his wife stroked his hair and tried to
cheer him because he had always been
the most affectionate and considerate of
husbands and fathers and because she had
never known his other nature she believed
in him like a good wife she had believed
all along that he was a martyr to official
jealousy

   dont worry daddy  she told him
 youre the best conductor on the divi-
sion manys the time ive heard the
other men say so they never have
treated you right whatever happens
wont be your fault and well get along-
well get along somehow

  the next morning before leaving home
dave wrote out his resignation hed rob
ewing of that much pleasure anyhow

  when he entered the superintendents
office at nine ewing swung about in his
desk chair and smiled up at him the
man hadnt changed much dave thought
he was older to be sure rounder firmer
with the solid lines of healthily-matured
manhood but he still had the old bovish-
self-confident look thorne remembered so
well

   hello thome  he greeted easily
 sit down 

  dave shifted and tried to assume his old
arrogance

  that wont be necessary ew-mr
ewing i know what im here for and
theres no use beating about the bush
heres my resignation 

  ewing took the folded paper glanced at
it and tossed it to his desk

   well sit down anyway-for old times
sake  he invited and smiled

  thome perched on the edge of a chair
and eyed the man as unconcernedly as he
could force himself to appear

   we are having the same thoughts this
morning i imagine thome  ewing be-
gan presently  we are thinking that
this old world is a pretty small affair and
that life is short too now that we have
occasion to look back upon a certain long
past event we can hardly believe that it
is more than twelve years since we first
met here on this very division and we are
wondering just how it came about after
all those years that we should again meet
here under present conditions

   being back here thome where i first
broke into the game has thrown me into a
reminiscent mood and i feel like talking
and without meaning to preach or boast
of personal achievement there are some
things i would like to say to you if you
care to listen

   when i left the t l  g and went
with the great continental he continued
without giving dave a chance to reply  i
had no thought of ever returning to this
road again the truth of the matter is
thorne i came here merely for experience
i had always wanted to work for the con-
tinental but as it is a stickler for trained
men i knew that a year with some other
road would be a valuable asset when ap-

and treasure in pacific isles

by helen hysell

they were a striking couple the sil-
very blonde at the comer table and
her dark-haired thin companion
striking not only because of their opposite
coloring but because of the contrast in the
expression with which each regarded the
other even a most casual observer in the
inexpensive restaurant on fifth avenue near
twenty-sixth street would have known at
once that lois mcallister saw oliver as
the one man in all the world

  the walls about them were cold white
tile the imitation marble-topped table
between them avas cool and sticky only
the ice cream they were eating and the
smile on loiss lips were soft and warm

  she looked at him now through a yearn-
ing violet-tinted haze of adoration tinged

with sadness and oliver momentarily
overcome by a fit of coughing lifted his
head to glare at her belligerently

   youve simply got to take that cold
out of this climate ollie old dear said
lois  california is-

  olivers mirthless laugh interrupted her
 it takes a blonde to tell a fellow what
to do when she knows he cant do it he
grumbled  maybe you think i wouldnt
go in a minuite if i could stop coughing
long enough to make a decent haul but
 cant only last week when i was prowl-
ing that joint in yonkers i had to quit
and make a get-away before somebody
thought the chimney had the croup

 less and his hand steady too he seemed
 to possess a strange sixth sense that led
 him to hidden treasures but a bad cold
 caught while rescuing a suicide from the
 lake in central park-if he had known
 the woman was a blonde he would probably
 have let her go to her reward-had settled
 down into a deep and rumbling cough
 bronchial rather than lungs the doctor
 said but a change of climate was advisable
 and oliver was broke he couldnt ply his
 trade as long as the cough clung to him
 and he couldnt get rid of the cough unless
 he could raise enough money to take him
 away from the salt damp air of new york
 oliver was out of luck and lois knew it

     ive got two thousand put away she
 reminded him insinuatingly  we could
 go west in style on two grand i could
 get a job in a cabaret out there while you
 hunted for something honest and-and
 safe

    few real men relish the idea of borrowing
 money from a woman some of these show
 their appreciation of the offer however
 while others secretly pleased hide behind
 a screen of anger at the very suggestion
 the fact that oliver was grateful to lois
 made his refusal all the more emphatic

     nothing doing  he said decidedly and
 rose to tower above her glaringly  im not
 taking a cent from any blonde male or
 female and im not traveling across the
 country with one either-not on your pretty
 pale-faced life im not blondes are my
 jinx 

    he stalked toward the cashier who hap-
 pened to be a blonde of the bottled variety
 and slapped his last dollar down upon the
 counter

    lois followed she understood oliver
 she knew that he liked her in spite of her
 sim-kissed tresses and she knew exactly
 what to say and better yet what not to
 say when he rebuffed her

     im not asking you to go with me she
 murmured as she trailed him through the
 door and across the street toward madison
 square park  i only want you to be uiere
 so i wont get so lonesome

     well youll have to worry along till
 you make some new friends out there
 stated oliver with finality  youre a

  good kid and all that but-youre a blonde
  and blondes are my jinx

  lois pulled her mauve feather hat farther
  down over the offending curls  if i dyed
  it she mused  it wouldnt match my
  complexion

   your brain would stay blonde anyhow
  said oliver  and its blonde brains that
  have me jinxed it was a blcfnde maid that
  dropped the monkey wrench into the big-
  gest haul i ever had a chance to make-she
  forgot about the burglar alarm and it was
  a blonde that made me catch this cold
  he coughed tentatively and a blonde
  almost snared me into marrying her once
  and cost me my roll it wouldnt do me
  any good for you to turn brunette on top

    lois had heard all this before and her
  attention deserted him to pursue an idea
  that had popped into her head

     did you ever try a stick-up she
  asked with seeming irrelevance

      once admitted oliver  proved that
  blondes have me jinxed-male and female
  the guy turned out to have taffv-colored
  hair and a dollar and thirty cents

     lois perched upon the end of a bench in
  the park and proceeded to develop the idea
  that had inspired the question oliver
  slumped down beside her coughing dis-
  gustedly

     ive got a date with tommy hammil
  to-night after the show said lois at the
  end of a long silence

     oliver frowned lois spoke rather often
  of tommy the young man represented
  the sum total of a wealthy family labor-
  ing under the delusion that he was liked for
  himself alone he spent his allowance so
  freely that he was usually on the verge of
  being disowned but tommy really was a
  likable youngster and ixis enjoyed his
  airy chatter and sincere good will toward
  the world oliver envied tommy his
  wealth and disliked the young man exceed-
  ing the very name of hammil brought
  a furrow to olivers sallow brow

    lois saw the frown and tucked it away
  in her heart to be analyzed later perhaps
  oliver was jealous of tommy without know-
  ing it oliver had never seen hammil but
  lois had mentioned some of his good
  qualities especially when those qualities
the blonde jinx



were in strong contrast to bad traits pos-
sessed by oliver

  tommy didnt use to carry much money
around with him she continued  but hes
made a pile lately and last friday he had
more than a thousand dollars in his poke
oliver used to carry large sums of money
about too now his pockets were empty
he stirred resentfully  whats that
lounge-lizard got to do with me

  lois powdered her nose thoroughly and
searched her purse for a lip stick  oh
nothing she answered indifferently  only
-tommy isnt a blond and youd get more
than a dollar thirty if i led him into a door-
way so you could take his roll away from
him

  oliver eyed her with suspicion not un-
mixed with hope  where did you find
that idea he asked

   its a good one isnt it countered
lois  tommys a nice kid and its a
shame to frame him but you need the
money and-

   and being a blonde youd double-
cross your best friend if you saw a chance
amended oliver

  nothing of the kind protested lois
 tommy isnt my best friend and besides
-if you dont get his roll somebody else
will that gang of bootleggers hes sup-
porting think hes a bank it would be real
charity to save him from a hooch-over
headache for a couple of days youd get
at least a thousand-maybe more

  oliver gazed into the face of the metro-
politan clock and listened while lois out-
lined the details of her plan it would be
so easy tommy would go anywhere she
wanted him to go and there were so many
dark doorways in new york after the
theater crowd had gone home and to bed
there was a peach of a place on fifty-fifth
street rose roselle lived on fifty-fifth
street and lois went to see her now and
then rose had pointed out this particular
hallway as a perfect place for a hold-up
oliver could go there about one oclock and
wait until lois led tommy up the steps
then oliver could pull his gun frisk
tommy and wander away

  oliver heard her to the very end of her
plan the minute hand on the metropolitan

clock sped from the half hour to the three
quarter and the bell chimed its unfinished
melody lois talked rapidly and well
oliver had said he wanted to make his
stake with his own two hands well here
was his chance

   well split fifty-fifty on whatever you
get from tommy lois finished  and we
can take the first train for connecticut
get married and go on to chicago where
the train starts for california

   theres only about fifty-seven different
things the matter with your scheme said
oliver abruptly  in the first place youre
a blonde -he turned toward her accusa-
tion in his eyes  and blondes are my jinx

  lois clapped her hat upon her head to
cover the curls that so aroused his ire she
might have known that he would object
to her plan men were so set in their no-
tions oliver would never believe that
blondes werent bad luck until she proved
it to him and he wouldnt give her a chance
to prove anything she rose

   ive got to get on the job she said
languidly  i promised to give a new girl
some pointers on my latest dance steps
if you change your mind about that scheme
of mine let me know

   im not going to change my mind
answered oliver  the chances are youd
take this tommy guy up to two hundred
and fifty-fifth street blondes havent
any sense of location he piloted her to-
ward the comer to wait for a bus  and
youd just as likely as not bring a police-
man along to make sure i did the job
thoroughly and-im not going to connec-
ticut or anywhere else with a blonde
youre a good kid lois and youll make
some man a peach of a wife but  -- he
sighed an unconsciously regretful sigh-
 im not the man a bus rumbled to a
stop and oliver assisted lois up the steps
 sorry he murmured by way of good-by
 but blondes have me jinxed me for a
brunette

  lois smiled a sad farewell and settled
herself upon the front seat of the bus where
she could watch the narrow margins nego-
tiated by the driver the driver was a
blonde so were five out of six women on
the bus all looked more or less safe none

of them looked as if they had brought bad  dont know where they are oliver
luck to anyone excepting themselves	coughed again  why dont you take that

oliver was ordinarilv so sane and sensi- lounge-lizard with the fat roll hell buy

ble a bit cross at times especially since his
cough bothered him so much a bit un-
reasonable about honesty and fair play-
considering his former profession-but or-
dinarily oliver was well worth the best
efforts of any girl and oliver had admitted
that she would make a satisfactory wife for
some one she smiled at the thought of
a honeymoon spent in california and the
brain beneath the silvery curls began to
improve upon her original plan to help
oliver pay his own way to frisco

ii

   in the restaurant where lois mcallister
 danced her way through the hearts of the
 orchestra straight to the pocket books of
 the patrons the performers were allowed
 an occasional moment of conversation with
 their admirers the management consid-
 ered this good business and the girls took
 advantage of it-in order to chat with their
 own particular sweethearts more often than
 with the moneyed patrons of the restaurant

   the moment tommy hammil appeared
at his table lois sent word to him to come
back stage in the cozy little reception-
room she greeted him effusively and smiled
adorably as she talked she even descended
to a giggle or two and tommy pink-cheeked
and willing departed with a chuckle of
anticipation the evening would prove
exciting even if he was spending his last
twenty-dollar bill

   later lois slipped into the telephone
 booth near her dressing room door and
 called oliver ohle

    ive broken my date with tommy
 she said when she heard the deeply husky
 voice at the other end of the wire  rose
 roselle is having a party in her room to-
 night will you take me

   a rumbling cough from oliver developed
 into a refusal  im tired he said be-
 sides its beginning to rain and you know
 yourself i oughtnt to go out with holes in
 the soles of my shoes

    youve got rubbers said lois cheer-
 fully  wear em

 you a taxi

   ill buy my own taxi if i need one
 answered lois  anyhow i dont want
 tommy i want you please ollie-ive
 already told rose that youd come shell
 think im ditched if you turn me down
 please oliver take me to roses party
 olivers bark was always worse than his
 bite his refusal gradually turned into ac-
 ceptance just as lois had known that it
 would oliver ohle had been a sociable
 soul before his cough interfered with his
 profession and his finances

   lois hung up the receiver with a throaty
 little laugh of happiness oliver was a dear
 and she loved him she would make him
 forget his fear of blondes blondes were
 all right if you pick the right one
 sooner or later oliver would find out that
 at least one blonde would bring him good
 luck

iii

   when oliver appeared wearing his rub-
 bers lois gave him her sweetest and most
 enchanting smile ollie returned it this
 dainty exquisite blonde was really pretty
 ollie walked with her from the front of the
 restaurant where he met her conscious of
 the admiring glances of all the men on the
 street whose eyesight was good

   as they strolled up broadway beneath
 olivers umbrella he began to wish that
 lois was a brunette she liked him that
 was certain the touch of her soft pink-
 palmed hand within his elbow was comfort-
 able and pleasant her violet eyes glowed
 softly if lois had only been bom a
 brunette-

   at this time of night fifty-fifth street
 was practically deserted only an occa-
 sional roving taxi or a homeward bound
 pedestrian drifted upon the street

    this is the place said lois a slight
 pressure on olivers arm guiding him up
 a flight of stone steps  rose is going to
 have a lot of-

   they had reached the top a tomb-like
 hallway waited to engulf them

 isnt this a lovely place for a hold-up
the blonde jinx



she asked stepping into the blackness

 good thing i know which bell to ring

  a harsh sharp voice shot forth a com-
mand from the dark  stick em up both
of you no monkey business unless you
want your faces shot off

  a hold-up oliver grinned he hoped the
hold-up man was a blond if so the gentle-
man deserved the disappointment that was
coming to him oliver had one lone cana-
dian dime and that was all he knew that
lois was too wise and too frail to carry
more than her  mad money -a dollar
with perhaps a nickel for subway fare

   crowd into that corner continued
the hold-up man  the one who makes a
noise is screaming for the coroner and
keep your hands up

  oliver obeyed the order he was watch-
ing the dim figure that loomed threateningly
in the darkness he made no defense
merely waited he took it for granted
that lois had obeyed the order too after
the first gasp of surprise she had remained
silent beside him

  the man stepped toward them and one
hand stretched forward to olivers breast
pocket at that second oliver flashed into
life one hand swept down to his hip
pocket and in the same movement it came
out again with a businesslike revolver the
other hand leaped forward grasping the
hold-up mans wrist pointing his gun aloft

  drop it ordered oliver snappily
jamming his revolver into the others belt
buckle

  the hold-up man obeyed then he began
to laugh  i didnt know you were going
to do that he said  lois i guess you
lose your bet	

  tommy loiss exclamation of sur-
prise was truly a work of art

   sure its tommy the hold-up man
replied you said that this fellow had
boasted that he wouldnt stand for a stick-
up but i didnt expect-

    pin your mouth shut commanded
oliver crisply  whats this all about

     it was a joke tommy replied a trifle
   uneasily  lois thought it would be fun
   to have you held up the jokes on you
   mr oliver ohle

 oh is it oliver did not seem to be

amused by the jest  keep your hands
pointed at the stars i need the money

   but ollie this is tommy ham-
mil lois explained and moved closer to
the young man just to show that she trusted
him

   another whisper from either of you
oliver remarked grimly  and ill smear you
all over this hallway his fingers were
busy  so you are tommy are you
he asked pleasantly  young man you
picked the wrong umba to play your pretty
little tricks on he found a nice fat
pocketbook  you lose this just for mak-
ing me mad

  tommy found his voice at last  lois
didnt tell me youd get mad mr ohle
she just said that nobody could stick you
up and-

   lois is a blonde interrupted oliver
 to-night will teach you not to trust
blondes theyre dangerous

   but- lois clasped olivers arm
 you wouldnt-why i didnt know-
ollie this is tommy ive mentioned him
to you dear just this afternoon i-

   hands off or ill make this goof look
like a sieve oliver was in no mood for
argument he put one finger under tom-
mys chin lifting his head  look at me
and then forget me he said to the young
man  im going away from here now and
if you ever see me again close your eyes
and say softly  this cannot be true if
you let out a peep to the cops youll regret
it for the rest of your life-which wont be
long

  tommy was frightened he had not ex-
pected to be treated in this fashion  i-
ill-not say a-a word to-

   that will do oliver turned grasped
lois by the wrist and started down the
steps  be deaf and dumb and petrified
for the next five minutes tommy darling
he called gayly  i might come back to
sweetums

iv

  it was a different oliver that turned the
comer at the end of the block  you
pulled another blond bonehead he said
 telling that  nice boy  that id stand for
a bum joke like that what are you going


argosy-allstory weekly

to do now tommys sure to have you
pinched

   lois had accompanied him this far will-
 ingly she did not desert him now  he
 cant have me arrested she said happily

  i resigned from the cabaret to-night and
 ive got everything packed ready to go to
 california im starting to-morrow

    but tommy knows where you live
 and he knows that you know me and-
  ollie wont you ever learn anything
 about blondes she asked plaintively  i
 moved to a new hotel the other day and i
 didnt leave a forwarding address she
 sighed softly  ollie wont you go out
 west with me youve got money now
 i know tommy always packed a roll and
 i wont even ask you to split fifty-fifty

   in the glare of an arch-light oliver
 stopped swiftly went through the pocket-
 book he had taken from tommy removed
 the bank notes and tossed the leather case
 into the gutter

     heres a taxi he said

   after they were seated in the machine
 lois began again  you dont have to go
 on the same train with me if you dont
 want to she pleaded  i just dont want
 to be in frisco all alone-

    youve got to get out of new york
 declared oliver  if you were auburn-
 haired id marry you in a minute lois
 if you were bald it wouldnt be so bad
 but you near-albinos have always brought
 me bad luck and im not going to tie up
 with my jinx

    all right the approaching tears dis-
 appeared from loiss eyes her charming
 chin grew firm  then im not going to
 california she said  im going to stay in
 new york with you ollie id rather be
 in jail in the same city with you than
 loose in california by myself

    what are you crazy dont you
 realize-

    i realize everything loiss tone indi-
 cated that she meant what she said  and
 ive got more sense in one of my bobbed
 hairs than any forty men in the world even
 if i am a blonde she leaned forward and
 spoke to die chauffeur  drive to the near-
 est police station she commanded

   olivers eyes seemed frozen open he had

 forgotten to close his mouth  say he
 exclaimed after a moment l thats not

right i dont want-

    but i do its no use pointing that
 awful revolver at me because i know you
 wont shoot me youre in love with me
 ollie and you wont hurt-

    im in love-

    of course i know you are since im
 in love with you loiss feminine logic
 pleased her greatly  if you dont go to
 california with me youll meet some girl
 some horrid mean brunette and youll
 imagje youre in love with her and-to
 save you from another woman ill- stop
 here she said suddenly to the chauffeur
  theres a policeman coming this way

   a blue-clad brass-buttoned officer of the
 law moved with dignified ponderousness
 down the street he disappeared for a sec-
 ond trying the door of a hardware store
 then he came out and proceeded toward
 the taxi

   oliver shivered  you wont do it he
 insisted in a tense whisper  you wont
 squeal-

    ollie you dont understand blondes
a bit lois remarked patiently id do
anything to keep you from falling in love
with a brunette ill tell this cop that you
just held up a man on fifty-fifth street
and ill give him tommys name and ad-
dress and-

v

  clad in a mauve bathing suit that
brought out the violet lights in her eyes
lois reclined upon the pale tan beach at
diego it was sunday and the pacific
basked peacefully beneath a cloudless sky
a gentle breeze tanged with salt romped
through her short and still blonde curls

   oliver sat beside her idly toying with
 handfuls of sand he was a bronzed and
 robust oliver wearing his bathing suit
 like a life-saver facing the world with clear-
 eyed contentment even if six months in
 california sunshine had not conquered his
 cough it would not have mattered financi-
 ally to oliver ohle for he was no longer a
 burglar

with the aid of a trusting soul back
east he had obtained employment with a
the bioxde jinx



concern that manufactured burglar-proof
safes and was now an honest citizen lois
would soon give up her dancing for the
more satisfying occupation of keeping a
suburban bungalow in perfect order

   are you happy dear asked lois
knowing what the answer to her question
would be

   sure replied oliver braving public
disapproval by kissing his wife

   happy enough to listen to something
ive had on my conscience ever since we
were married persisted lois her eyes upon
the exquisite blue waters of the pacific

  olivers smile was serene  go ahead
he requested  im not afraid of you

   i thought not a pink-tinted glow
drowsed through her as she turned toward
him  i knew all the time youd get over
your hate of blondes well you remember
that night you held up tomm- hammil in
new york

   yes oliver grinned reminiscently
 he carried an awfully cheap poke for a
rich mans son i noticed it at the time
but was too busy to mention it

   well tommy had exactly one grand
on him didnt he and as you say the

pocketbook was cheap also it was new
well -lois hesitated a second- i wanted
to loan you a thousand and you wouldnt
take it because i was a blonde i planned
to give it to tommy and get you to hold
him up and you wouldnt do it because i
was a blonde so-i got him to hold you
up knowing that you wouldnt let him get
away with it and-and i planted that
pocketbook full of hundred-dollar bills on
him while he giggled over the joke he and
i had put up on you tommy didnt know
he had that money i slipped it in his
pocket just before you frisked him

  jolted by the news olivers recovery
took fully three minutes at last he spoke
and there was both awe and admiration in
his voice  i must have been wrong about
blondes not having brains he said slowly
 you got tommy to hold me up so id get
mad and frisk him and you planted half
your roll on him to make it worth my while
and you got me to marry you and come to
california with you and-

  having summed up the situation to his
own satisfaction oliver ohle sighed in
cheerful resignation  i sure was wrong
about blondes being my jinx he said

   and sorrows a high hill covered with stones-

i sent to the neighbors for trouble to borrow

 how to score football games

                 r poicy haught ok stein which he used to be the
                  coachman for the harward university footballing team just
                  wrote it a book which it tells you how you should watch it a
                  footballing game it is a wery nice book on account the
                  covers alone must have cost a lot of money and i aint
                  knocking the book me and poicy was chust like that when
                  me and him was at harward together i was up at cam-
                  britches taking a lot of pictures from the harward footballers
                  cambritches is the town where harward uniwersity is

                          when i was first up there taking photografts for the
                      newspepering business they made a funny mistake one of
                      the footballers seen me taking the photografts and he hol-
                      lered  hey fellers here is a yale spy taking photografts
                      from the precticing

    then he kicked me in the face and a lot of other fellers came and they kicked
me out from harward uniwersity at first i got a little bit sore on account  thought
they didnt want me around the place and i explanationed to them that i wasnt no
yale man and that i never even been to yale uniwersity

    then the captain from the footballing team he appologized in a nice way to me
he said  you are such a funny looking feller that we was all sure that you was
a yale feller the mistake was quite natural so you couldnt blame nobody but
yourseluf for what happened the yale fellers is such foolish looking fellers that
we are all the time making mistakes last week we drowned a feller on account we
thought he was a yale man and it came out on the corners inkwitch that he was
some poor feller which he escaped from a foolish house near here perhaps you come
from the same place and not from new haven at all

    i told him i was from new york which i came there from alice island when
they let me out from the steeritch of the boat which i came on it from kovno in
lithuania then they apologized a whole lot more and the feller which he kicked me
in the face said he wouldnt do it no more on account he had hurt his foot and
couldnt prectice no more that day

    poicv haughtonstein told me i could stay and see the precticing on account i


izzy kaplans kolumn



 looked so dumb that i couldnt understand the plays anyhow so there wouldnt be
 no harm done by nobody he said so in such a nice way that i am feeling at home
 right away in the harward camphouse which is what they call it the big fields near
 cambritches

    but i am kind of disappointed about mr haughtonsteins book about how you
 should watch a footballing game and how you should call it the plays according
 to mr haughtonsteins way of talking i couldnt understand nothing about the foot-
 balling at all he is talking about the shifts from minnesota and the right guard
 should go through the left teckle which honest is greek to me

    it aint mr houghtonsteins fault on account the only feller which he could
 description a footballing game in the right way is a doctor footballing is more in

                                               his line of business

                                               i got a friend who is in the doctoring
                                          business and i loined a lot about it from
                                          talking to him also when i was in the hos-
                                          pital that time i loined a whole lot more

harward got the two ribs back

 i got in the hospital on account i got too friendly with some of the friendly sons of
 st petrick on march  i only esked them if i could be electioned a member
 they aint answered me yet anyhow i dont think they have because it was right
 after that that i went to the hospital and i never heard no more from the friendly
 sons of st petrick so maybe they aint so friendly after all

      here is how  would description the game so that a total stranger would under-
 stand what it is all about you got to get some of the technical detailers or you
 wouldnt know who won

      the yale full beck went through the center and broke two of his ribs harward
 got the two ribs back and one collar bone in a buck at the yale teckle the yale left
 end chust broke his collar bone but the bulldog left guard chust brought in one
 crimson ear and a shin bone from one of the cambritches forwards

       i ime was taken out after these few plays so that the amberlances could carry out
 three or four players the harward right end refused to ride in the same amberlance
 as the yale left teckle on account the amberlance was painted blue he laid in the
 field till they got a crimson amberlance and then he went out singing  fare har-
 ward  which it is some conductors song they are all the time singing at cambritches

       in the second quarter the play was a little rough as one of the incidents which it
 occurred would indication a harward feller pulled off a yale fellers ear and threw
 it in his face and the  ale feller hollered  foul which it held up the game while


argosy-allstory weekly

the referee and the corner and the undertakers for each team held it a consulting in
the rule book it said that a loose ear in the field would belong to the feller which be
should fall on it first and harward was penaltied three ribs and a collar bone which
brought the ball to ten yards from the crimson bowl and the yale fellers sang it a
song which they call it  the undertakers song

     the undertakers which they was stending by the side lines took off their hats
and bowed and the harward fellers holler  fight fight this would seem kind
of silly because from what a feller could obserwation the fighting had commenced to
start a long time before that if they wasnt fighting then i never seen no fighting
they made chon l solomon look like he was only a pinocle player after all

     when the finish has ended to the game comes it the most important part from
the footballing business how you should tell what it is the score that is where a
feller should know something about the medical business or he wouldnt even know
who won

     he scoring is something like this yale two collar bones eighteen ribs two
compound frectures from the legs three ears one eye and four noses broke

     harward one collar bone fourteen ribs no compound frectures one ear no
eyes and three noses

     from this score a expert like myseluf would know right away that the yale foot-
ballers won the game if you aint really acquainted with the sports and dont know-
nothing about the medical business you would have to wisit all of the hospitals and
get it the retoins from the house doctors and then add them up or if you dont do
that you have to wait for the corners ink witch

     i am glad that mr haughtonstein sent me the book even i couldnt understend
it on account i want him to get moe konigsbergs cousin sol the privileges of the
yale bowl this season sol is in the doctoring business but the trade is dull in new
york and he would give the footballers a wery good rate prowided he got the yale
bowl oxclusive

     fashion note-crutches will be carried by all of the welbdressed fellers in the
uniwersities this fall

    next week izzy kaplan will comment on the fate of ex-champions
